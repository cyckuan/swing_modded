EDITORIAL: OSLO AND THE ISRAELI ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 4:
</P>
<P>
   Five and a half years after the historic handshake at the White
House by Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, negotiations to reach a
final peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians are
dormant. Tuesday, May 4, marks the date that both sides had
targeted for completion of an accord, yet the most difficult issues
remain to be addressed, including the shape and status of a
Palestinian state and the future of Jerusalem. Whatever government
Israelis select in the coming election must revive the Oslo peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Oslo timetable has been frozen since December, when Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly suspended implementation of
the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank that was
set at the Wye Plantation summit meeting in October. Netanyahu said
he could not go ahead with more pullbacks because the Palestinians
had not cracked down on terrorism. But he also acted after
concluding that his fractious Likud coalition was not prepared to
follow through on the Wye agreement. He then struck a deal with the
opposition to dissolve Israel's parliament and hold an election a
year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu showed courage in signing the Wye accord, which would
have put 40 percent of the West Bank territory previously
controlled by Israel under at least partial Palestinian control. It
was unfortunate that he decided to suspend the process after the
first of three phased steps. The Palestinians have not done all
that some had hoped, and Arafat has made too many inflammatory
threats to return to violence. But the Palestinians changed their
charter and worked to arrest suspected terrorists. Under American
pressure, they also withdrew their threat to declare the
establishment of a Palestinian state on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the first round of Israeli voting, candidates
for prime minister have said little about the Wye agreement and
Oslo peace efforts. That could be a positive sign, indicating a
consensus in Israel over trading land for peace with the
Palestinians. A new government embracing that view is not
guaranteed, however. Netanyahu charges that his opponents would
give too much away to the Palestinians. Yitzhak Mordechai, leader
of the new Center Party, insists that Netanyahu cannot be trusted.
Ehud Barak of the Labor Party says the economy and the peace
negotiations are ``stuck,'' though he is unclear on what he would
do.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have been watching the campaign with some
restraint. Clinton recently said he supported Palestinian
aspirations ``to determine their own future on their own land,''
his strongest endorsement yet of a possible Palestinian state.
Whoever wins will quickly have to complete the withdrawal of forces
contemplated by the Wye agreement. Last week, Clinton rightly
pledged to restart the process after the elections, aiming for a
summit meeting within six months. Negotiations, not threats or
unilateral actions, are the best way to achieve self-government for
Palestinians and security for Israel.

RODERICK THORP, 62, A DETECTIVE TURNED POPULAR CRIME NOVELIST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roderick Thorp, a former private investigator whose best-selling
crime novels became successful films, was found dead last Wednesday
at his home in Oxnard, Calif. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to have died three days earlier after a heart
attack, said a son, Roderick Thorp III of Camarillo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Thorp was best known for his suspense novels ``The Detective''
(1966), which was made into a 1968 movie with Frank Sinatra and Lee
Remick, and ``Nothing Lasts Forever'' (1979), which became the 1988
film ``Die Hard,'' starring Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Thorp was born on Sept. 1, 1936, in the Bronx. He graduated in
1957 from City College of New York, where he won a Theodore Goodman
Short Story Award. After graduation he sold cars, worked in a
haberdashery, founded a catering company and worked in insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20s, he also worked in his father's private detective
agency, where he once spent a week lying under a bus spying on a
mechanic selling stolen gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Thorp stopped being a detective when ``The Detective'' was
published. The novel, a gritty look at the lives of big-city police
detectives, earned him hundreds of thousands of dollars and some
degree of fame. He was not quite an overnight sensation, though.
``The Detective'' was his second novel; his first novel, ``Into the
Forest'' (1961), did not sell well.
</P>
<P>
   His other best seller was ``Nothing Lasts Forever,'' about Joe
Leland, a burned-out ex-cop turned security consultant who is
caught in a terrorist siege of an office building.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote ``Wives,'' with Robert Blake (1971), ``Circle of
Love'' (1974), ``Westfield'' (1977), ``Rainbow Drive (1986) and
``River: A Novel of the Green River Killings'' (1995). His articles
also appeared in many magazines and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to California, Thorp taught literature at Ramapo
College in Mahwah, N.J., from 1971 to 1976. He also lectured on
creative writing at schools, colleges and writers' conferences in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Roderick, Thorp is survived by his wife,
Claudia; another son, Stephen, of Woodland Hills, Calif.; two
sisters, Sandra Kuch of Tampa, Fla., and Patricia Kerrigan Roth of
Oldsmar, Fla., and three grandchildren.

ADVERTISING: INTERNET ADVERTISING HAS BEEN SLOW TO CATCH ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT in parentheses has been used in
the 4th graf instead of the symbol, which is non-transmittable to
some newspaper systems.) 
(lh) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To address the nagging issue of how to make
Internet advertising more effective and profitable, a group of
advertisers and Web publishers formed an organization called FAST,
or the Future of Advertising Stakeholders, last August.
</P>
<P>
   But during a trade show on Internet advertising being held here
this week, FAST's chairman, Richard A. LeFurgy, joked that maybe
the group should change its name.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about `not-so FAST,''' LeFurgy said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting during the (AT)d:tech conference on Internet advertising
and marketing, FAST members said Monday that while they had made
progress in the last nine months, much work remained to convince
companies to spend their advertising dollars online. The mixed
sentiment is reflected in two studies released to coincide with the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for advocates of online advertising comes from the
Internet Advertising Bureau, an online advertising association also
led by LeFurgy. The bureau reported that Internet advertising
revenues hit $1.92 billion in 1998, more than double the $907
million spent in 1997, surpassing the $1.58 billion spent on
outdoor advertising in 1998. LeFurgy called that a significant
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the types of products and services
advertised online were becoming more diverse. During the fourth
quarter, noncomputer retail advertising represented 29 percent of
Internet advertising, compared with 20 percent for computer-related
advertising. LeFurgy said that demonstrated that Internet
advertising was no longer merely the realm of the technology set.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a study to be released Tuesday morning by the Association of
National Advertisers has found evidence that mainstream advertisers
continue to feel uncertain about the medium. The association's
study, which mostly focused on the advertising patterns of the 500
largest industrial companies, concluded that the percentage of
companies it surveyed that advertised online had decreased to 61
percent during 1998 from 68 percent the year before. Those that do
advertise on the Internet are spending less than they did a year
ago, the study found _ $649,000 in 1998 versus $714,000 the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were based on reports from 121 member companies,
although a handful of the companies surveyed in 1998 differed from
those that participated in 1997, thus making the year-to-year
comparisons inexact, said Robin Webster, the association's senior
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Webster said, the study clearly showed that major
corporations remained skeptical of how to put a value on online
advertising. ``They're still not comfortable with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, 68 percent of companies surveyed said that a ``key
barrier'' to advertising online was that they did not yet know how
to measure their return on investment _ in other words, whether the
ad dollars they spend bring in new consumers or revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers want proof that the ads they pay for wind up on
consumer monitors, not downloaded halfway, or never seen at all,
Ms. Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In print you have a tear sheet, on TV you get a report that
the commercial ran,'' she said. ``This medium has not been able to
do that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said the association's study found major
corporations were increasingly comfortable with the Internet in
general. She said that in 1998, not one company reported it had
limited Internet advertising because senior management did not
``appreciate the value of the Internet.'' In 1997, 33 percent of
companies surveyed gave that response.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webster was quick to praise FAST, of which she is one of 750
members, for being the ``best vehicle'' for helping create
standards for Internet advertising and measuring the effectiveness
of online ads.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has recently published guidelines for Internet
advertisers and publishers on three topics: how to protect consumer
privacy, how to create standard sizes and placement for
advertisements and how to measure how many people view an ad. The
hope is that the guidelines will become de facto standards, much
the way print and television have accepted standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made tremendous progress in the last eight months,''
LeFurgy said. ``We've taken on issues of breadth and depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivienne Bechtold, director of interactive marketing for Procter
&AMP; Gamble, which helped form FAST and is one of the nation's largest
advertisers, said the prognosis was improvingfor Internet
advertising. She said P&AMP;G now advertised 30 brands online _
including Crest, Tide and Cover Girl _ three times more than it did
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed some of the increased comfort to the work of
FAST. ``Considering it's a totally volunteer organization with no
resources, it's made some really great progress,'' she said.

KNICKS EARN PLAYOFF BERTH BY BEATING CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There had been a clamor for change, a call for a new
twist on an old team during the summer. And so the New York Knicks
looked around every corner, peered down every dark alley and found
the kind of talent to ultimately phase out Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not a night to celebrate a sleek remake of the
Knicks. This was a night when the Knicks found comfort and calm
amid the flurry of a big game by leaning on what was familiar. They
turned to Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   And he turned in one of his most dominant games of the Knicks'
tumultuous season to help the Knicks clinch a playoff berth with a
95-88 victory against the Boston Celtics on Monday night at Madison
Square Garden. By winning their next-to-last game of the regular
season, the Knicks advanced to the post-season for the 12th
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing ignored the pain in his Achilles' tendon, shrugged off the
boos from a crowd that grew impatient with his plodding style in a
tight fourth quarter, scored 27 points, grabbed a season-high 19
rebounds and put the Knicks in a spot they have grown accustomed
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the Heat,'' the crowd chanted in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And for the third straight year, the Knicks (26-23) could see
their old rivals from Miami in the playoffs. If the standing
remains as it was on Monday night, the Knicks will lick their lips
and set their sights on the team they love to loathe, the Heat, in
a matchup of first- and eighth-seeded teams. And Ewing helped make
this tantalizing matchup possible despite playing his first
back-to-back games in a month, and in spite of anyone who believed
he should shut himself down for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been writing me off for a long time,'' Ewing said.
``I always believe in myself, and when I stop believing in myself,
and believe that I can't play this game at a high level, that's the
day I'm going to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not care what people think. I'm just playing ball. I
think when my body is healthy, I can perform at a high level. If
the shot clock is running down, I'm going to take the shot unless
I'm doubled, then I'll pass it. Everyone can moan, and y'all can
write what you want, I don't care. I'm me and I'm going to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was typical Ewing to the end. After the Celtics tied the game
at 81-81 with 5 minutes 17 left, Ewing was part of a 7-0 run to
pull away after he hit a 5-foot runner and gobbled up two key
rebounds. Even though he had missed two previous shots, and the
crowd was beginning to squirm, Ewing stubbornly kept fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disppointing to me that every time he shot, the crowd
murmured,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``He was the dominant
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing put the Knicks into a position to face the Heat. Miami may
be the one elite team the Knicks have the best chance to beat. But
there are an array of playoff possibilities for the Knicks. At the
least, they have secured the eighth and final playoff spot. At
best, they could finish in sixth place, albeit that is a remote
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Knicks beat Miami in the last regular-season game on
Wednesday and both the Bucks and 76ers lose their final two games,
New York would win the three-way tie. On the tie breaker, the
Knicks would have the best combined record against the other two
teams. A two-way tie with Milwaukee would go to the Bucks because
they won the season series with the Knicks. To finish seventh, the
Knicks would need to beat Miami and have the 76ers lose their last
two games to force a tie; the Knicks, by virtue of their season
series edge with Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   If the 76ers win just one or their last two games, the Knicks
would be in eighth regardless of whether they beat the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy just had to cross his fingers on how his team would
approach such an important game. Although the Knicks are a veteran
group, this was not the grizzled group with a history of big games
behind it. The Knicks traded John Starks and Charles Oakley for two
players from losing franchises in Latrell Sprewell and Marcus
Camby.
</P>
<P>
   So it was hard to predict the start. But the beginning was not
the problem. Quickly, Ewing, working around the paint without a
limp, hit his first three shots as the Knicks built an eye-popping
16-0 lead with seven minutes left in the first quarter. By that
point, every Knick starter had scored for an offense that was
working efficiently and unselfishly.
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly, the Celtics (19-30) turned up the ball
pressure, cranked up their chaos-causing defense and squeezed the
Knicks into a four turnovers. The Knicks mistakes gave them life
for a 22-9 run to finish off the quarter trailing by just 25-22.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Ewing was off and missed five shots in a row during
Boston's spurt. And no one was picking up the slack, not Houston or
Sprewell. Unless there was a dunk, as there was when Charlie Ward
broke the press and found Sprewell darting free to the hoop, the
Knicks' offense was at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks stopped moving the ball, were trying to take every
Celtic one-on-one and fell behind, 30-29, early in the second
quarter. Once they discovered each other again via the assist, and
picked up their defense, the Knicks inched ahead and closed out the
first half on a 7-2 run and held a 46-38 lead at the half.

DODGERS BEGIN INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Los Angeles Dodgers didn't wait for official word
from the commissioner's office regarding allegations made by two
minor-league players that team officials helped with their
defections from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The club began its own investigation during the weekend. Among
those interviewed were the involved players _ outfielder Josue
Perez, 21, of Single-A Vero Beach and first baseman Juan Carlos
Diaz, 23, of Double-A San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The players said the Dodgers staged secret tryouts in Cuba,
assisted them in leaving the country and signed them at their
offices in the Dominican Republic. The players, through agent Gus
Dominguez, have asked the commissioner's office to declare them
free agents because they are upset about their signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Monday, Dodgers officials said they hadn't heard or
received anything, from the commissioner's office. But Steve
Schneider, a partner of Dominguez's at Total Sports International
in Beverly Hills, said he expects Major League Baseball to contact
the Dodgers within 24 to 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers issued a statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned Friday that Mr. Gus Dominguez has written a letter
to Major League Baseball requesting an inquiry into the
circumstances under which the two players were signed in 1996
(Diaz) and 1998 (Perez). We have not received a copy of the letter
and therefore cannot comment on its contents. However we have
commenced our review of the allegations . . . and are prepared to
cooperate with the commissioner's office in addressing this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The players contend that Pablo Peguero, general manager of the
Dodgers' baseball complex Campo Las Palmas in the Dominican
Republic, scouted the two players and held tryouts in Cuba,
eventually arranging their defections. But Peguero said he hasn't
been to Cuba in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Diaz said via telephone from San Antonio.
``He saw me one time. He talked to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz also said he worked out for Peguero in Cuba, which Peguero
denied. The players also said Campo Las Palmas vice president Ralph
Avila helped in the manner.
</P>
<P>
   Vero Beach manager Alvaro Espinoza declined an interview request
for Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no personal knowledge whether that's true,'' Schneider
said of the players' claims.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz was given a $65,00 bonus and Perez's bonus was $40,000.
Neither are considered top prospects in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said he read the documents sent to the commissioner's
office but didn't feel it was appropriate for him to comment on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a pending investigation from the commissioner's
office. A correspondence was made with them,'' Schneider said.
``The documents speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers face fines, suspensions and the possible loss of
selections in the amateur draft if they are found in have broken
rules. But most of the front-office staff for the Dodgers are new
to the organization, which could factor into a ruling if the
accusations are true.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Fox Group purchased the Dodgers there was a feeling
of autonomy throughout the organization. That's changed in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   While Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone wouldn't comment on
the Cuba allegations, he did reaffirm his belief in the way he runs
a minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a chain of command,'' Malone said. ``We have a system
in place where there are supervisors, department heads and
directors. We're trying to implement a system.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Osuna returns: The Dodgers strengthened their bullpen by
activating right-handed reliever Antonio Osuna prior to Monday's
game and optioned lefty Jeff Kubenka (0-1, 20.25 ERA) to Triple-A
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson will have to use Osuna
cautiously. He's been on the disabled list for all but three days
of the season and is pitching with a bone spur in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs time off in between (appearances), a day off, which I
like to do anyway,'' Johnson said. ``(The bullpen) is an intricate
part of the club and I need all the parts there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Raul Mondesi was in the cleanup spot
for the second straight game; Todd Hundley (3 for 5, 3 RBI) was
inserted into the fifth spot and Eric Karros dropped to sixth. It
was the 19th different lineup Johnson used this season. . . . A
strange rule was enforced in the fifth inning when second base
umpire Terry Tata ruled Chan Ho Park took more than the allotted 12
seconds between pitches, awarding ball four to batter Dustin
Hermanson.

YANKEES BOW TO ROYALS, 9-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Tony Muser, the manager of the Kansas City
Royals, has heaped praise upon the New York Yankees in the last two
years for their intense play. During Sunday's loss to the Yankees,
he stopped his young infielder Carlos Beltran in the dugout and
noted Bernie Williams's hustle to first base on an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   That desire, that's what it takes to win, Muser told Beltran, in
so many words.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday night, Muser could have pulled Beltran aside and
used some of the Yankees as examples of how you should not play the
game, how a lack of concentration can bury a team. Mental mistakes
killed any chance for a Yankees' comeback in a 9-3 loss to the
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are cruising in the American League East standing,
winning two-thirds of their games. They are hardly a juggernaut,
however _ their middle relief is something of a mess, their defense
has been erratic, they have had little run production from the
bottom third of their lineup. And they are regularly committing the
kind of mistakes that almost never occurred last year, when they
won 125 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees trailed, 3-1, in the sixth inning on Monday night,
but in every inning they were pressing the Royals, who already had
used three pitchers. It was just a matter of time, it seemed,
before the relentless Yankees would get someone on base and someone
else would drive a ball in the gap to tie the score or take the
lead, allowing Muser to rave about their desire.
</P>
<P>
   But desire and concentration abandoned the Yankees in the bottom
of the sixth. Orlando Hernandez, who had allowed three runs in the
first two innings and kept the Yankees close in spite of very
lackluster stuff on this night, allowed a one-out single to the
slow-footed Chad Kreuter, the ball flaring to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, the left fielder, moved deliberately to the ball,
without any sort of anxiety about Kreuter, who rounded first and
charged toward second while Ledee fumbled the ball. Ledee was
charged with an error, but he could have had two: one physical, for
bobbling the ball, and a mental mistake, for not scampering after
it. The Yankees have 20 errors in their last 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals loaded the bases, bringing Beltran to the plate, and
he slapped a bouncer to the right side; Tino Martinez, the Yankees'
first baseman, came in a couple of steps to catch the ball and
throw home for the second out. Catcher Jorge Posada was set to fire
to first base for an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Except nobody was at first base. Martinez was too far from the
bag to make the play because he had fielded the ground ball, but
Hernandez had not moved from the mound _ at least the third time
since the final days of spring training that a Yankees pitcher had
failed to cover first base.
</P>
<P>
   The inning continued, with devastating results. Hernandez walked
home a run and was replaced by Mike Stanton, who, in his first
outing in four days, walked home another run on four pitches. Dan
Naulty relieved Stanton and made a wild pitch that allowed the
Royals to score their third run of the inning. He then gave up a
three-run homer to Mike Sweeney. It was a finishing blow.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had no hits in the first three innings against Jose
Rosado, the Kansas City left-hander who broke three bats with a
fastball that ran in on the hands of right-handed batters. But the
Yankees knocked Rosado out of the game, quite literally. After Chad
Curtis rapped a one-out single in the fourth, Williams smashed a
one-hopper that caromed off Rosado's left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado folded over near the mound, grabbing his shoulder. Muser
and the assistant trainer Lee Kuntz rushed out, and so began a
lengthy debate as to whether Rosado would remain in the game.
Rosado spoke to Kuntz and Muser, who talked to the home plate
umpire, Tim McClelland, and then Rosado threw warm-up pitches,
appearing as if he was fine. He talked some more to Muser, who
spoke to his trainer and then McClelland. The moon rose. The sun
set, somewhere west of here.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado threw two more warm-up pitches and stepped off the mound.
More talking. And more. Finally, Rosado handed the ball to Muser
and departed, and when another few minutes passed before a reliever
emerged from the Kansas City bullpen, Don Zimmer, the Yankees'
interim manager, jumped to the top step of the dugout and glared.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Service replaced Rosado and maintained a lead for Kansas
City. Chili Davis hit Service's first pitch on the ground and to
second base, for an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez doubled to open the fifth inning and eventually scored
on a sacrifice fly by Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   But the Royals still held a 3-1 edge when Service relayed the
lead to the left-hander Alvin Morman in the sixth inning, with two
outs and two on. Morman struck out Martinez on three pitches to
close out that rally. &QL;

MERCURY PRE PARES FOR WNBA DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kurt Budke remembers the day four years ago when Cheryl Miller
came to Athens, Texas, to call on Shalonda Enis. He even has photos
of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, Cheryl Miller was the greatest ever to play the
game,'' said Budke, coach at Trinity Valley Community College.
``People who are saying Chamique (Holdsclaw) didn't see Cheryl
Miller play. It was an honor to have her come in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then coach at the University of Southern California, Miller was
in Athens to recruit Enis, the 1994-95 junior college Player of the
Year. But Los Angeles is a long way from Celeste, Texas, where
Enis' son Chase, then 4, would be living with his grandmother while
Shalonda went off to a Division 1 school.
</P>
<P>
   ``USC was too far away for Shae,'' Budke said. ``At Alabama, she
could drive home on weekends. But she loved Cheryl, I do remember
that. I know they're both very competitive people, and they'd get
along very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance could come today if Miller's Mercury makes the
25-year-old Enis the 10th pick of the first round in the WNBA
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Although Phoenix needs a perimeter shooter and the 6-foot-1 Enis
(pronounced INN-is) was a power forward with the Seattle Reign of
the American Basketball League, she has small-forward shooting
skills.
</P>
<P>
   And with 6-1 Michelle Griffiths, who started 31 games for the
WNBA runner-up, out due to pregnancy, the Mercury can find a place
for a talented front-court addition, either as a starter or
reserve, depending on how successful it is in switching 6-3
Jennifer Gillom to power forward and starting 6-8 Maria Stepanova
at center.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive season, Stepanova and 6-5 backup
center Marlies Askamp will be late to training camp because of the
European Championships, May 28-June 6, a qualifier for the 2000
Olympics. The 32-game WNBA season begins for Phoenix on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Enis fits in every category, particularly if she can play on the
perimeter like she did in the 1998 ABL All-Star Game: 15 points, 5
rebounds, Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mercury were to grab Enis, she would be a taller and
potentially more productive option at small forward than two-year
starter Umeki Webb, a 5-10 defensive specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL Rookie of the Year in 1997-98, Enis averaged 18 points
and 7.6 rebounds. Her second-season numbers were 13.7 and 8.0 when
the league folded in December. She averaged 20.1 points and scored
a school record 766 in her first season (1995-96) at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Enis is one of a group of talented swing forwards from the ABL
that the Mercury would welcome. Others include 6-1 DeLisha Milton,
6-foot Adrienne Goodson and 6-3 Tari Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so effective because they can step out, guard on the
perimeter, they can post up, flash and slash,'' said Linda
Hargrove, who coached the ABL Colorado Xplosion last fall and is a
consultant for this draft for the expansion Orlando Miracle.
``They're going to be very valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who will direct the Mercury draft, said she is not
adverse to taking a `quality big player of the Milton/Phillips
variety, but lights up at the thought of a scoring small forward
with Webb's defensive tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's Enis or Goodson or a guard-forward swing player
like Edna Campbell or Crystal Robinson will be known early today.
The four-round, 50-player draft (expansion Minnesota and Orlando
each pick five players, the other teams four) begins at 8 a.m.
Arizona time.
</P>
<P>
   League officials still were racing to sign players Monday, since
only those under contract are eligible for the draft and the
signing process was delayed until ratification of a four-year
collective bargaining agreement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The long rumored allocation of ABL guards Shannon Johnson to
Orlando and Katie Smith to the Minnesota Lynx became reality
Monday, leaving centers Yolanda Griffith (to Sacramento) and
Natalie Williams (Utah) as the likely second and third overall
picks after Washington selects Holdsclaw, the four-time All-America
forward from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Then the draft could get interesting.
</P>
<P>
   If 34-year-old point guard Teresa Edwards does not sign by this
morning, and the Los Angeles Sparks go for the best available
player, say Milton over sore-kneed point guard Dawn Staley, that
could leave Staley and Jennifer Azzi available for Charlotte (No.
9) and Houston (12th), both of whom need point guards.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Coach Brian Agler is expected to choose guard Tonya
Edwards at No. 7 to pair with Smith, reuniting two-thirds of his
perimeter trio from the two-time ABL champion Columbus Quest.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Detroit (No. 5), New York (No. 6) and Orlando (No.
8) with picks that could influence the Mercury selection. One
logical scenario is: 6-5 center Clarisse Machanguana to Detroit;
Goodson to New York; and Phillips, who played high school and
college ball in Orlando, to the Miracle.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow Enis, who has also been in frequent contact
with both expansion teams, to fall to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheryl's a great coach, a players' coach,'' Enis said. ``She
gets into her players and brings out the best in them. The energy
she brings to her team is something I'd love to be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel blessed to go anywhere. I just want a job, period.
Wherever I go, I'll give it all I've got.'' &QL;

FISHER IS POINT MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Derek Fisher, who began the season by
playing his way out of a starting job, has played himself back into
it in time for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis said Fisher will finish out the season as the
Los Angeles Lakers' starting point guard and continue into the
playoffs, which begin this weekend. Derek Harper, who started 29
games between Fisher's stints, will remain as the backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the way it's kind of evolved with this team right
now,'' Rambis said. ``I just like the way that he starts, and Harp
gives us a big lift coming off the bench, and Ty (Lue) is kind of a
spot-minute guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has been steady if not spectacular, but then this team
has no shortage of spectacular with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant. It was Fisher that Rambis went out of his way to praise
after Sunday's win at Seattle, when Fisher posted six points and
six assists and set the tone on both offense and defense with his
gutty play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Derek plays his butt off every night. It's unfortunate
our point-guard situation gets criticism,'' Rambis said. ``The
high-profile players get all the notice and stuff, but there's a
lot of players who do a lot of unselfish, unheralded things on this
team that never get recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is averaging 4.8 points, 4.4 assists and 1.9 turnovers in
19 starts this season, including a shaky nine games to start the
season which prompted Harper's insertion as the starter. But when
Rambis decided to rest Harper for the postseason, Fisher got
another chance and has earned the right to stay in the lineup.
Heading into Monday's game, he'd started eight straight games,
averaging 5.2 points, 4.2 assists and 1.4 turnovers in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Now he'll start in the playoffs for a second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's news to me,'' Fisher said, ``but at this point whatever
has to be done to keep us playing the way we've been playing,
that's what I'm for. If it was coming off the bench, starting,
whatever, I like the way things are going now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Prep time: If the Lakers hold onto the fourth seed and start
the playoffs at home, Rambis is considering a quick jaunt to Palm
Desert for a two-day minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being kicked around,'' he said. ``We're looking at
College of the Desert right now, but we're not 100 percent that
we're doing that yet.''

REDS WIN DRAMA PRIZE, GAME, TIP D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Darren Holmes shrugged off the twisted ankle Monday
night, and, after one warm-up pitch, declared himself fine.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't. Not with his location.
</P>
<P>
   His sinker was sinking too much. His slider was breaking out of
the strike zone. Before he knew it, the Cincinnati Reds had the
bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth, a situation all so
familiar with the Diamondbacks' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cameron, on an 0-13 slide at the plate, one-hopped a pitch
off the right-field wall for a 4-3 victory that had the
Diamondbacks slowly walking off Cinergy Field, dejected by another
last-inning loss.
</P>
<P>
   They saw too many in the first week, and they're starting to see
them again.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the fell to Milwaukee, 6-5, after blowing two leads and
failing to score with the bases loaded and nobody out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, like anything, is cyclical, and the bullpen, it seems,
is hitting the bad cycle again.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not Brian Anderson and Gregg Olson, squandering leads,
one day. It's Holmes unable to get through one inning, the next.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Cameron's hit was the best pitch Holmes delivered _
a low-and-away fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he'd try to pull the ball and I wanted him to hit it on
the ground,'' Holmes said. ``It was a good at-bat. He's a good
hitter. He's going to be a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   The blame can't all go to the bullpen. Greg Swindell gave the
Diamondbacks a chance with two shutout innings, before Holmes
started the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Andy Benes was willing to take some of the fall. He
walked two batters and gave up two hits in the first to put Arizona
(14-13) in a 3-0 hole. After that, however, his velocity improved,
his fastball was hitting the spots he wanted, and he looked closer
to the guy who shut the Reds down last year in a no-near no-hitter
than the one who came in with an 8.76 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bad first inning,'' Benes said. ``I just wasn't
sharp. I fought back and we had a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bats fell silent in the last five innings when the only
hit was by left fielder Luis Gonzalez, who extended his
league-leading hitting streak to 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Credit starter Steve Parris, called up from Triple-A
Indianapolis for this game, and relievers Dennys (cq) Reyes, Scott
Sullivan and Scott Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long trip,'' Gonzalez said. ``Fourteen days feels
like a month already.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially coming of two three-plus hour games. Sunday's 3-hour,
37-minute game was Arizona's longest ever for nine innings.
Monday's game last 3:02.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have two more games with the Reds, before they
can come home.
</P>
<P>
   Two more games to try to right themselves in the pen and at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking a certain finality in the seventh, eighth,
and ninth innings,'' Manager Buck Showalter said. ``A lot of things
can happen. We have nine inning to score more runs. I try to put
that in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Things just didn't fall for the Diamondbacks. A potential big
inning was squashed in the second when Matt Williams, running on a
3-2 count, was nailed on his trail leg by a sharply hit grounder by
Damian Miller. The ball would have gone through, Williams would
have scored to make it a 3-1 game and runners would have beeen on
first and second with one out. Instead, Williams was out on the
play, and Parris got Tony Batista to ground out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored a run in the third on Jay Bell's fly in
the right-center gap that was hauled in by center fielder Cameron.
Bell had two other balls hit hard in the gaps that were caught by
the speedy outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff happens,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller tied the score at 3 in the fourth with his two-run homer
after Steve Finley triped with one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things happen when you close your eyes and swing,'' said
Miller, who didn't know he was going to start for ailing Kelly
Stinnett, until after he lifted weights in pre-game.
</P>
<P>
   If figured, it wouldnt be easy for the Diamondbacks in the ninth
when Holmes came up hobbling while fielding Aaron Boone's leadoff
bunt single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt when it happened, but I didn't feel it after that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Pokey Reese advanced Boone on a sacrifice, pinch hitter
Mark Sweeney was intentionally walke. Holmes walked pinch hitter
Hal Morris on four pitches and fell behind Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes never could get ahead in the count on anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw some good 0-2 pitches (in my mind), just not against
them,'' he said.

<P>
   PHOENIX - Welcome to Game 7, the best moment in sports, the
ultimate clash of pressure and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   And welcome to ground zero, the first of two hurdles that will
serve as radical turning points in the future of the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   When the puck drops this evening, you will see an entire
organ-I-zation ride a mad teeter-totter of emotion. When it's over,
people will be exhaling with victory. Or bracing for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And if you listen closely, you can almost hear the ground
moving.
</P>
<P>
   A win on May 4 doesn't _ to borrow a phrase from Coach Jim
Schoenfeld _ guarantee victory on May 18. But the two are certainly
related. More than ever, and much more than the owner wants to
admit.
</P>
<P>
   Simple as a ripple: As long as the Coyotes are playing, they
carry a buzz, make headlines, remain relevant. Advertising without
cost, escorting you to the doorstep of the Los Arcos referendum.
</P>
<P>
   If the Coyotes prevail, the tail wind will be strong. They will
be hailed as conquerors, the team that finally went in and killed
the beast. You will look at them differently. And so will the
owner, Richard Burke.
</P>
<P>
   If they win, they accomplish everything.
</P>
<P>
   Before the playoffs, Burke was very comfortable, almost cocky
about his set of polling numbers. But the story has gotten a bit
complicated. Jeremy Roenick ended up in a hospital bed. A city
council member in favor of Los Arcos received a death threat. The
project's funding mechanisms came under new scrutiny. And at the
worst time, a hockey team took the dreaded detour. North. Toward
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   If the Coyotes lose now, after a 3-1 lead in the series, the
dissection will not be pretty. For a few days, it will matter that
the Coyotes fought valiantly with what remained in the room. But
inevitably, they will be thrown into the blender of their past.
Because they fit the profile. Caretakers of the Evil Twinnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   As if the stifling pressure of a Game 7 weren't enough of a
load, this undeniable debris is swirling over the Coyotes. They
feel it, and, oh, how they bristle at this Winnipeg thing. They are
right in claiming distance, that most had nothing to do with a
tailgate legacy. What they don't understand is that history matters
in sports. That, to you and me, legacy is always part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Win, and it all goes away. Win, and maybe the owner wins, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a murky stage of finance redesign, the Los Arcos project
sorely needs a lift, a sales force, and none is better than the
hockey team. If the Coyotes win, the vote might pass. And if
victory brings victory, the owner will have his building, his
revenue streams, his chance to spend ``and'' feel good about
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   If the Coyotes win one of these two battles _ a playoff series
or the referendum _ there is a good chance that the team will
remain largely intact.
</P>
<P>
   But if loss breeds loss, cover your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   If Los Arcos dies in the wake of a celebration that never
happened, there could be sweeping changes. You know about
Schoenfeld, but it would go deeper than the anointed scapegoat.
Burke is a passionate owner prone to mood swings. He is tired of
losing money trying to win. And if he must return to America West
Arena in defeat, no doubt, he will begin by cutting his losses.
</P>
<P>
   First, the crunching of numbers. Then, the big question: If the
gutting becomes too severe, does Bobby Smith jump off the train?
Leaving behind a couple of empty offices, a pair of titles and a
job tailor-made for the real phantom menace, Mike Keenan?
</P>
<P>
   So welcome to Game 7, an event dizzy enough on its own merits,
full of stress and finality, full of ends and beginnings. But this
time, the stakes are raised to an absurd level.
</P>
<P>
   Put your ear to the ground and you can hear the rumblings. A
sense of dread. And a party waiting to burst.
</P>
<P>
   No, not much going on tonight at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Just a night that may build a stadium. Or tear down the existing
walls. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TWO weeks earlier in San Antonio, Mario Elie pounded the point home
in fitting and dramatic style.
</P>
<P>
   He nailed the game-winning 3-pointer against the Rockets in what
was then a huge game for both teams. He screamed. He stared at the
Rockets' bench with eyes that said, ``Take that.''
</P>
<P>
   And he pounded his fist on his chest, like a sort of kiss of
death. It was as if he was showing the Rockets that contrary to the
flat-line impression made in 1998, Elie's heart still was beating
like a champion's.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Sunday. In another huge game against the Utah Jazz,
Elie showed that heart again in a game that could lead the San
Antonio Spurs to the best record in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   There was Tim Duncan, who could win the Most Valuable Player
award. There was David Robinson, the former MVP whose role has
changed drastically. And there was still another player, Sean
Elliott, suddenly showing the kind of nerve that matched his skill.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rockets were facing the Los Angeles Clippers,
trying to find their way into top playoff form, desperately trying
to fight their way to the No. 4 seed and a home-court playoff edge
against the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Could one player _ one mere complementary player such as Elie _
make such a difference? The Spurs say yes. The Rockets are left
only to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   As the playoffs now fast approach, it has become clear the
Rockets underestimated Elie at his best. They underestimated the
Elie who has a raging fire, a champion's heart and an undying will.
</P>
<P>
   They underestimated the Elie who is not afraid to tell a player
of Robinson's caliber that he needs to draw more out of his
basketball soul. They underestimated the Elie who can tell Elliott
he is indeed soft and then challenge him to fight like a champion.
They underestimated the Elie who can demand that Duncan show more
emotion on the floor and not be afraid to become the best player in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the Elie who was in a Rockets uniform a year ago.
And that's why the Rockets can only wonder if Elie would have made
these 1999 Rockets better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Elie the Rockets knew a year ago often was surly, less
productive than expected and a mere shell of the emotional force
that helped bring a pair of NBA championships to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He moped about not getting a two- or three-year contract
extension. He felt hurt and unappreciated when his name was
mentioned in trade rumors. Eventually he left, and the Rockets felt
better off because of it. But were they?
</P>
<P>
   Elie was a huge presence in San Antonio's win over the Jazz, as
he has been in so many games this year. He scored 15 points, and
his influence on Duncan, Robinson and Elliott never was more clear.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was the second choice in the Spurs' attack all day, as
he has been throughout their resurgent 1999. But he seemed to revel
in it all, with huge rebounds, tip-ins and blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott hit big free throws down the stretch and was unshakable
in situations that once had him quaking in his Nikes. He drove and
dunked on Jazz star Karl Malone for a big bucket in the fourth
quarter. Later, when Malone tried to rattle Elliott before he took
a pair of crucial free throws, Malone flexed in front of Elliott
and said, ``Give me two, Sean.'' Elliott stared Malone in the face
and said, ``Yeah, I'll give you two.'' He sank both to secure the
win.
</P>
<P>
   Of Elliott's transformation, Elie said, ``I think Sean's gotten
tired of me riding him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Elie, Duncan said, ``He's been huge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the season, San Antonio was a team in transition,
perhaps not to the point the Rockets were in transition, but
looking for its way nonetheless. The Spurs were soft.
Underachieving in the playoffs. Robinson's role needed to change.
Duncan needed to assert himself as the focal point. Clearly, the
Spurs needed Elie and are better because of him.
</P>
<P>
   Would a new contract and the influx of new faces have been
enough to reignite Elie's fire in Houston had he stayed? Or would
the Rockets' transition season with Scottie Pippen have been
complicated even more, with rookies Michael Dickerson, Cuttino
Mobley and Bryce Drew getting some of Elie's minutes and so many
postgame locker-room scenes finding Elie surly and mumbling again?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only a team such as San Antonio could have brought out
Elie's best. Perhaps only a team desperate to find a championship
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Lakers, whose search for direction went so far as
the signing of a caricature _ Dennis Rodman _ could have used him.
Rest assured, Elie would not have been afraid to look Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the face and tell them what it was all
about.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Sonics, who are out of the playoffs despite talents
such as Gary Payton, Vin Baker and Detlef Schrempf, could have
found heart with Elie rattling cages and bluntly quashing egos.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are still searching for their championship-caliber
game. They can only wonder. But the Spurs wonder no more.

TIME FOR TALK IS OVER  
 THERE'S PLENTY ON THE LINE AS ROUND 1 REACHES END

<P>
   PHOENIX - Put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it all boils down tonight for Coach Jim Schoenfeld
and the Coyotes. Nothing more, nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   If they beat the St. Louis Blues tonight at America West Arena
in Game 7 of their nail-biting, first-round playoff series, as
Schoenfeld boldly has guaranteed, the Coyotes move on.
</P>
<P>
   If they lose, Schoenfeld is under the impression that ``he''
likely will be on the move _ looking elsewhere for work. The
second-year coach gave more credence to mounting speculation that
he could be relieved of his duties if the Coyotes don't make it out
of the first round for the first time since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise has managed to accomplish that task only twice _
both times as the Winnipeg Jets _ in its 20-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``History this, history that,'' snorted Coyotes forward Dallas
Drake, who leads the club in postseason scoring with four goals and
seven points. ``You guys have to write about that, but 99 percent
of the guys on this team weren't around for the Winnipeg days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can write about the Winnipeg stuff all you want, but it's
up to the 20 guys in here to just forget about it and go play.''
</P>
<P>
   Put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   Faceoff is at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As if this Western Conference quarterfinal series didn't have
enough twists and turns and one-goal-game drama, Schoenfeld made
sure it became the most talked-about match-up so far in the
postseason with his surprising post-game prediction on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After the Blues scored twice in the third period of Game 6 to
snap a 3-3 tie and hang on for their second straight win after
losing three in a row, Schoenfeld uncorked this beauty:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win Game 7. . . . I would tell you I would
stake my job on it, but that's already been done, so I'll just say
we're going to win Game 7. Thanks, fellas.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, the fiery former NHL defenseman who's grabbed
headlines during the postseason before as a coach with things to
say, abruptly cut short his question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   He'll probably want to make it even shorter if the Coyotes are
eliminated and allow St. Louis to become just the 15th team since
the best-of-seven format was introduced to the Stanley Cup playoffs
in 1939 to rally from a 3-1 deficit to win the series.
</P>
<P>
   It would be so Winnipeg-like, too, if it happens. You can
already hear the one-liners coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do the Coyo-Jets keep getting kicked out of bars?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they can't handle the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix players will tell you it's unfair to link their
first three seasons in the Valley to any past first-round failures
by the Lose-ipeg Jets. They shouldn't be held accountable for the
sins of their forechecking fathers, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody from the past is still here so we can't
go around carrying their baggage,'' center Mike Stapleton said.
``The Coyotes are a new organization, so I don't think we bring any
of that with us.''
</P>
<P>
   They probably shouldn't, either. But there's only one way to
make it permanent. Put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the team that can do it,'' center Bob Corkum
said. ``Everybody will step up and we'll get the job done and get
this Winnipeg jinx or whatever the media is calling it off our
backs. And then, I never want to hear it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hear this: The Blues hail from the ``Show Me'' state of
Missouri, and they aren't as impressed with talk as they are
action. They haven't been impressed with the Coyotes'
penalty-killing units, either. St. Louis has rattled off an NHL
playoff-high nine power-play goals in the series so far and are on
pace to break the 1990-91 Minnesota North Stars' record of 35 if
they make it to the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schoenfeld, of course, the Blues are toast tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' St. Louis forward Scott Young said.
``It's just a way for him to try and pump up his team. We've got
the momentum and he's just trying to get his troops going.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many sports personalities have been able to make gutsy
guarantees like that and get away with it. Joe Namath did and the
New York Jets won a Super Bowl. Mark Messier did and the New York
Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1994. So did former Suns Coach Paul
Westphal, whose team got past the pesky Los Angeles Lakers in 1993
and advanced to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just trying to let everyone know he's behind us,'' Drake
said of Schoenfeld. ``Unfortunately, he's trying to take the
responsibility right now and he shouldn't. It's the 20 guys in that
room. The coaches have come up with a good game plan for us. It's
up to us 20 guys to go out and do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner advances to the conference semifinals to meet the
Dallas Stars or, if San Jose can knock off Colorado, the two-time
defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we're going into this game thinking we're going to win,
too,'' Coyotes forward Stephen Leach said. ``We're going out with
the mind-set it's going to be fun. A lot of guys in this room have
played in Game 7s before and that's what hockey's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   A win, and the season, the coach, and maybe even hopes for a new
arena are saved. A loss, and you probably can expect changes from
top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure's on to win, that's the bottom line,'' Coyotes
captain Keith Tkachuk said. ``The pressure's on them to win, too.
Nothing else matters. What happened in the first six games, you can
just throw out the window. . . . We'll see if home ice pays off in
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'll also see if Tkachuk and the Coyotes' other top dogs
can break out offensively in the biggest game of this franchise's
life. Tkachuk has one goal. Robert Reichel has one goal. Rick
Tocchet has none.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to produce, no question,'' said Tkachuk, who led
Phoenix in goals (36) during the regular season for the fourth
straight year. ``It comes down to one game and who wants it more
and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, put up or shut up.

BOSTON GOES HOME TO HEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals rookie  &UR; David Boston was supposed to go
to Boca Raton, Fla., in the next two weeks to train with All-Pro
wide receiver  &UR; Cris
 &UR; Carter of the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The workout will have to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, the Ohio State wide receiver picked eighth overall,
instead has returned to his hometown of Houston to recover from a
fractured bone in his left shoulder suffered at Sunday's minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   His sister,  &UR; Alicia, who also is one of his agents, said Boston
still is hurting but is not upset about the injury, which is
expected to keep him out about a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday, he was in shock,'' she said. ``He couldn't believe it
had happened. He didn't talk to anybody because he was in pain. He
still doesn't feel very good. But otherwise he's doing OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia, a Dallas attorney, said her brother is relieved that he
doesn't have to have surgery and that the bone will heal on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   She said team orthopedist  &UR; Russell Chick and offensive
coordinator  &UR; Marc
 &UR; Trestman called Monday to see how the rookie was feeling.
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother and second-year cornerback  &UR; Corey Chavous,
whose collision with Boston caused the injury, have spoken and that
there is no problem between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked at the tape and they both know it was an
accident,'' she said of the play that happened during a no-pads
workout. ``Corey apologized and told David he even tried to stop
himself (from colliding). Everything is fine between them.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury isn't expected to have an effect on Boston's contract
negotiations, which haven't begun. Doctors have told Boston he will
be fully recovered by the July 30 start of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Fast start &QL; 
Second-year wide receiver  &UR; Andy McCullough continues to tear up the
NFL Europe League.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough's five catches for 109 yards and one touchdown give
him 17 receptions for 298 yards and three scores this season.
McCullough, who plays for the Frankfurt Galaxy, is second in the
league in receptions and scores.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end  &UR; Jomo Cousins, who plays for Berlin, is third in
the league in sacks with three. &QL; 
Full of confidence &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle  &UR; Anthony Clement, who has predicted he will win
the starting left tackle job, said doctors have told him they
aren't certain his back will be 100 percent healed when training
camp opens.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, who missed all but one game last season because of a
herniated disc in his back, is optimistic he'll be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in my heart I'll be ready,'' he said.

5TH BOWL COULD BE ADDED TO BCS  
 WOULD HELP APPEASE FORGOTTEN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fifth bowl could be added to the Bowl Championship Series as
soon as 2001 if a preliminary plan recently introduced to college
football officials earns approval.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is designed to quell the controversy created over the
past few years when bowls bypassed higher-ranked teams to create
match-ups that would sell more tickets and attract larger
television audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Kansas State and Arizona were left out of the
four-bowl series, while lower-ranked Florida was chosen to play in
the Orange Bowl. The year before, the Fiesta Bowl bypassed UCLA and
North Carolina to take Kansas State, which was ranked lower but
gave the bowl a better chance to fill Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan would add a fifth bowl to the rotation, but that
bowl's place in the process is undetermined. It would either match
two of the highest-ranking teams that weren't selected by the other
four bowls, or the bowl could included in the championship
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't gotten that far to know what we're really
talking about,'' said Roy Kramer, commissioner of the Southeastern
Conference and coordinator of the BCS, which includes the Fiesta,
Orange, Sugar and Rose bowls.
</P>
<P>
   BCS officials will discuss the proposal again at a meeting this
summer. If the plan progresses, it could be approved for the 2001
season, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the bowls in the series takes turns hosting a game that
features the top two ranked teams in the country. The other bowls
have conference tie-ins that fill one slot in their games, and they
select BCS eligible teams for the other spots.
</P>
<P>
   The selection process created problems last year, the first
under the BCS agreement, and in previous years under the old Bowl
Alliance because deserving teams felt left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the first year of the BCS and the last three to five
years of the alliance, you can pretty much target two teams that
deserved very high consideration to be included at the BCS level,''
said John Junker, executive director of Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Because of geographical reasons, the most likely candidates to
be added to the rotation would be the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio and
the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS already has two bowls in the Southeast and two in the
West. Adding a bowl in the Central time zone would be advantageous
for television purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard anything specific,'' said Derrick Fox,
executive director of the Alamo Bowl. ``Would we have an interest?
Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's counterpart with the Cotton Bowl, Rick Baker, also is
intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no earthly idea what the timetable is or where they
are in the process,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker has heard that a fifth bowl wouldn't be precluded from
hosting a national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business perspective,'' Fox said, ``that's where you
want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding a fifth bowl likely would mean extending the existing BCS
agreement, which has three more years remaining, with an option for
three more. It would also need the approval of ABC, which televises
BCS games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of issues involved,'' Junker said, ``not
the least of which is what is the team selection process and what's
the arrangement for the championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS was created to guarantee a match-up between the top two
ranked teams in the country. The arrangement became possible when
the Rose Bowl agreed to join, making the Pac-10 and Big Ten
championships available.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, those conferences' champions were locked into
the Rose Bowl, which had refused to join in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS was successful this year in producing a national
championship game. No. 1-ranked Tennessee beat Florida State,
23-16, in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy was produced by the remaining bowls' freedom to
create match-ups, regardless of rankings.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Orange Bowl, by virtue of a conference
affiliation, took the Big East Conference champion, Syracuse. In
order to sell tickets, bowl officials then selected Florida as an
at-large team, bypassing Arizona and Kansas State.

General Peter Verniero, whom she has nominated to the New Jersey
Supreme Court, as ``110 percent loyal.'' She has rewarded that
loyalty by appointing him to ever-higher positions, making him her
chief counsel, chief of staff and then attorney general in 1996.
But personal loyalty to Whitman is not a good enough reason to
promote Verniero to a seat on the state's highest court, a position
that he may hold for 30 years. The Republican-controlled State
Senate should reject Verniero's nomination for his lack of legal
experience and his long failure to stop the use of racial profiling
by the New Jersey State Police, which his office oversees.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court has a history of intellectual rigor
and nonpartisanship. Verniero, who barely meets the State
Constitution's requirement of 10 years of legal practice, has spent
years as a political appointee. Prior to 1993, when he joined the
Whitman administration, he had worked less than six years in
private law practice. His lack of experience has made his
nomination controversial in the legal community.
</P>
<P>
   His performance in office also argues against his elevation to
the Supreme Court. For nearly his entire tenure as attorney
general, Verniero denied that the state police discriminated
against minority drivers. Despite a court ruling in 1996
substantiating racial bias in traffic stops, Verniero continued to
defend the state troopers. Last week, in appearing before a State
Senate committee, he refused to accept blame for doing nothing for
years about a problem he now acknowledges exists.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero is not the first attorney general to ignore complaints
of racial harassment by the state police. But his failure to take
timely action shows he lacks the legal judgment needed on the high
court.

EDITORIAL: NO MORE COMEBACKS FOR ELWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 4:
</P>
<P>
   John Elway, who retired Sunday after 16 seasons as quarterback
for the Denver Broncos, is the third exceptional athlete to leave
the American sporting scene this year. Michael Jordan said farewell
to basketball in January and Wayne Gretzky ended his hockey career
in April. Elway does not rise to quite the same level as Jordan or
Gretzky, each of whom may have been the best player in the history
of his sport. It would be hard to make a case that Elway was the
``best'' of a breed that includes Sammy Baugh, Johnny Unitas, Joe
Namath and Joe Montana. But he was certainly something special, and
football will be poorer without him.
</P>
<P>
   There are two words that Elway brings to mind _ toughness and
confidence. Elway was the master of the comeback, scrambling and
improvising as the final seconds ticked away, then rifling the ball
to an open receiver in the end zone. In this category, he is
indisputably the best of all time _ engineering 47 game-winning or
game-tying drives in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For years, it appeared that football's greatest prize, a Super
Bowl victory, would elude him. Denver lost in its first three
appearances, but in 1998, Elway got his first championship,
direct-ing a fourth-quarter drive to defeat the favored Green Bay
Packers. He won his second title last January.
</P>
<P>
   Elway says he will now spend more time with his family and on
the golf course, which should be a lot easier on his 38-year-old
body. Despite limited playing time, he regularly shoots par, and
has driven a ball 380 yards in Denver's rarefied air. Television
viewers may not have seen the last of his toothy grin and
competitive fire.

BLUES SURVIVE HULL EXIT  
 OTHER PLAYERS CREATE IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - He was the spirit of St. Louis, the life principle of
a sporting community longing for greatness from its hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   When the Blues lost career scoring leader Brett Hull to free
agency last summer, fans led the cry of ``Now what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now what'' can be seen tonight at America West Arena, as the
Blues and Coyotes face off for Game 7 of their Western Conference
playoff series. Suggesting the team is better off without Hull, who
signed with Dallas, is absurd, but the Blues are successful in a
different way and are on the verge of eliminating the Coyotes from
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season, any time we had a two-game slump or a shutout, it
was `Brett Hull, Brett Hull' with the media,'' defenseman Jamie
Rivers said. ``Hopefully, after the season's done, we'll never hear
about Brett Hull again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean that in a bad way. He was a good guy and a great
hockey player, but he's not a St. Louis Blue anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull not only was a great scorer, but because he attracted
attention, he opened room for his linemates, particularly on the
power play. Yet an area that was expected to suffer this season
finished third in the NHL after tying for ninth last season.
</P>
<P>
   The key has been the point play. Al MacInnis' slap shot from the
right is downright intimidating, and Chris Pronger, who stepped in
at left point when Steve Duchesne left, is creative and dangerous.
Down low, Pierre Durgeon is the biggest factor behind the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Chris and Al make good decisions with the puck,'' St.
Louis Coach Joel Quenneville said, ``whether it's a shooting power
play or a more controlled power play. I think these guys recognize
the type of pressure they're facing. They improvise very well,
which is probably the best kind of power play.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of a legitimate star, 24-year-old Pavol Demitra,
the Blues' go-to guy and top scoring threat, also surfaced after
Hull.
</P>
<P>
   The forward led the team in goals, assists, points and power
play goals this season and was second in the NHL in game-winning
goals (10).
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great year, and maybe if Brett was over there, he
wouldn't have been able to use his shot and skills as much,'' left
wing Geoff Courtnall said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the players were eager to see Hull leave. Yes, he was
opinionated and honest, but he was also well-liked and he wasn't
nearly as divisive in the locker room as many believe.
</P>
<P>
   His contractual differences with management did make life
interesting last season. The issue was less about money than about
the Blues' unwillingness to put a no-trade clause in his new deal.
The Stars were willing and signed the standout to a three-year, $17
million deal.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, a Blues victory tonight could set up a
second-round meeting with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hull's contract talks were so public, his teammates
weren't stunned when he wasn't re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Courtnall said. ``We went through so much of it
last year when Brett was upset and he voiced his opinions in the
paper. They were really in a battle all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who took it hardest were the fans, who couldn't understand
how the organization could let a legitimate superstar go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame the fans in St. Louis,'' said Larry Pleau,
Blues senior vice president and general manager. ``He played on the
team for 10 years, and he was one of the best goal scorers ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things always can be bumpy, but I felt the way Brett
handled it, so professional, kept it from being really rocky. He
had his reasons, we had ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtnall said: ``I think it shows what a great group this is
and what a great job the coaching staff has done this year. When
you lose a guy like him that puts up 80 points a year, yet your
power play is one of the best in the league and you still have a
lot of success, it says a lot about this organization.''

DRAKE'S PLAY EARNS PRAISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  AND TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - He's played right wing, left wing, been moved from the
first line to the second and back again, but it seems no matter
where the Coyotes play him, they know they're going to get an
honest effort from veteran  &UR; Dallas Drake.
</P>
<P>
   Drake has scored at least a point in five of six playoff games
and leads the club in postseason scoring with seven points on four
goals and three assists. He had just three goals in 21 previous
playoff games before this series against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's played great so far,'' goalie  &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin
said. ``He's been our top scorer and he's really stepped up his
game more than anybody else. I've known Dally for a pretty long
time and I know he can play good, so this isn't a big surprise, but
it's a good one.'' &QL; 
Time bandits &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting developments in the series is the
staggering amount of ice time being logged by Blues defensemen
 &UR; Chris Pronger and  &UR; Al
 &UR; MacInnis.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger has played 34 minutes, 52 seconds, 40:14, 33:38, 30:19,
37:39. In Sunday's Game 6 he logged 33:39. MacInnis has logged ice
chunks of 31:59, 37:16, 34:26, 34:42, 36.09 and 36:10,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I'd do if I ever got that much ice time,''
Coyotes forward  &UR; Louie DeBrusk said, ``I'd probably have to go
right to the hospital and have to be put on life-support systems
because I'd probably die. I have no idea how they do that, but
those two guys are phenomenal athletes. It's unbelievable. I take
my hat off to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronger averaged a league-high 30.6 minutes during the regular
season. MacInnis ranked fourth overall at 29.1. The Coyotes'
ice-time leader was defenseman  &UR; Teppo Numminen at 24.4. &QL; 
Cup crazy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Injured center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick, contemplating returning for the
playoffs _ perhaps tonight? _ despite a broken jaw and a fractured
thumb, was asked what his wife,  &UR; Tracey, thinks of his decision:
</P>
<P>
   ``She already knows I'm nuts.'' &QL; 
No home cooking &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes worked hard for 82 regular-season games to gain no
worse than a No. 4 seed so they could have home-ice advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Their first-round series will go the distance of seven games,
but MacInnis, the Blues' playoff scorer leader with nine points,
pretty much thumbs his nose at the Coyotes' home-ice edge. He
points out that each team has won two games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think home ice is a big advantage in Game 7,''
MacInnis said. ``In fact, it doesn't seem to be much of an
advantage at all in this series. We're ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been facing elimination now for two games. They're the
team that kind of had the pressure off them.'' &QL; 
Grant is correct &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grant Fuhr said after Game 1 that he likes playing before the
whiteout crowds in America West Arena for the playoffs, largely
because it enables him to see the puck better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably does help,'' said the Coyotes' Khabibulin. ``White
is white and black is black. The puck stands out more.''
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested that perhaps the team should provide end zone
fans black flash cards _ such as those used in football card
sections _ which they could hold up on each Coyotes shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do, move the fans every period when we
exchange ends?'' he asked. &QL; 
The big hurt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a slap shot from  &UR; Chris McAlpine, not
MacInnis, that caught Coyotes left wing  &UR; Mike Sullivan in the left
leg during Friday night's 2-1 loss in Game 5. But the shot was
still painful enough to force Sullivan to skip Game 6 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His availability tonight is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes also are without  &UR; Juha Ylonen (fractured foot) and
 &UR; Greg Adams, who missed his second straight game because of a
pulled groin and is questionable for tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let it wear on you,'' Sullivan said. ``Every team
goes through injuries and we've had our fair share, but I think
guys have stepped up when other guys have been out of the lineup
and the team has found ways to win.'' &QL; 
By the numbers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr passed  &UR; Billy Smith on the all-time playoff victory list,
moving to No. 2 behind Colorado's  &UR; Patrick Roy with his 89th career
postseason win. Roy entered Monday's game with 102 victories.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis has 100 career playoff assists, moving him ahead of
 &UR; Guy Lafleur into 23rd place in all-time playoff scoring with 135
points.  &QL;

KIDD EARNS LEAGUE HONOR  
 OFFENSE BELONGS TO PLAYMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - No wonder Suns playmaker &UR; Jason Kidd needed some rest
in the club's final regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd was named the NBA's Player of the Month for April Monday
after accounting for more than 43 percent of the team's offensive
production last month, according to the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were 10-6 in April with Kidd averaging 20.1 points,
10.4 assists, 6.7 rebounds and 2.38 steals while playing an average
of 42.6 minutes a game. Thus, he either scored or assisted on at
least 43 percent of the team's 94.2 points a game during the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had not determined how many of the field goals Kidd
assisted on were three-point shots, so the percentage is actually
greater than 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd also recorded two of the league-leading seven
triple-doubles he has this season during April.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd is the first Suns player to win the award since &UR; Kevin
Johnson was named Player of the Month in 1997, also for the month
of April. &QL; 
Playoff tickets
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for Game 3 of the team's first-round playoff series go
on sale today at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It is yet to be determined whether the Suns will play Portland,
Utah or San Antonio in a five-game first-round series. No matter
the opponent, the Suns will play the first two games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets can be purchased at America West Arena's ticket office
or by calling 379-SUNS or Dillard ticket outlets at 503-5555.
Tickets for Game 4, if necessary, will go on sale the day after
Game 3. There are plenty of seats available for Game 3. &QL; 
Playoff special
</P>
<P>
   Channel 45 will air a half-hour Suns playoff special Thursday
night at 9:30 p.m. Forward &UR; Clifford Robinson, a candidate for the
All-Defensive Team and one of the best three-point shooters this
season, will be the centerpiece. &QL; 
Manning camp
</P>
<P>
   Forward &UR; Danny Manning announced his annual summer basketball
camps for children grades 3-12 will be held July 19-23 at Horizon
High School. The focus of the camp is fundamentals, sportsmanship
and fun. Cost is $100. For more information, call (602) 996-2473 or

WILLIAMS PLAYER OF MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Diamondbacks third baseman  &UR; Matt Williams was
honored on Monday as the National League Player of the Month for
April, but he considered it more a team honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't ultimately be there if  &UR; Jay Bell wasn't having a
great season and  &UR; (Tony) Womack wasn't getting on base and  &UR; Luis
Gonzalez wasn't hitting as well as he is,'' said Williams, who had
a league-best 25 RBIs for April and hit .357 with eight home runs
and had a .694 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a Diamondback was honored as player of the
month. Bell and Williams were named NL player of the week,
back-to-back, in April.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Williams was honored for a month was May '95, when
he hit .404 with 12 homers and 31 RBIs for San Francisco. Williams
had forgotten about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just goes to show how much it means,'' he said. ``I can't
even remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it's nice, but you play the game to get to the
playoffs and win the World Series, not for individual awards.'' &QL; 
Cursed tattoo &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just above reliever  &UR; Greg Swindell's right ankle is a tattoo of
a T crossed through a horseshoe.
</P>
<P>
   He said the T came about a year after the horseshoe, which he
got while pitching for the Houston Astros in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's supposed to be for good luck, right?'' Swindell said.
``After I got it, I had the worst (expletive) year of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He was slowed by a groin injury and, with a 7.83 ERA and 0-3
record, the Astros released him.
</P>
<P>
   The following spring, in Fort Myers, Fla., Swindell was back in
the tattoo parlor. Not to get rid of the horseshoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have cost $1,000 to get rid of it,'' he said. ``I
just had them put a T through it.'' &QL; 
Weighing in &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do the Diamondbacks do in the clubhouse in their spare
time? Monday, at Cinergy Field, they were weighing heads. Pitcher
 &UR; Brian Anderson's head weighed 13 pounds. Assistant athletic
trainer  &UR; Dave Edwards led those who weighed in at 19{.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got too many brains,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Edwards, ``It's dead matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The readings were made by laying on the ground and putting their
heads on the scale.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre suggested a better way of achieving a
more accurate reading of everyone's heads: ``Chop them off.'' &QL; 
Short stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catcher  &UR; Kelly Stinnett was a late scratch from Monday's lineup,
because of flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said he may give Bell a day off at
second base during this three-game series. That means Womack would
return from the outfield to play his natural position. Asked
whether he thought Womack would mind, Showalter's answer was an
emphatic no.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching three straight days, closer  &UR; Gregg Olson was not
an option Monday, Showalter said. Olson gave up a three-run homer
to
 &UR; Marquis Grissom in the eighth inning of Sunday's 6-5 loss to
Milwaukee. Olson said the difference between that blown save and
the three he blew the opening week is, ``I won't carry this one
with me.'' &QL;

PARK BLISTERS MONTREAL; JOHNSON WINS 1000th 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Chan Ho Park pitched his best game of the season,
leadoff hitter Eric Young left the game before an out was recorded
with a right-calf strain and Dodgers manager Davey Johnson won his
1,000th game.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the major points in the Dodgers' 7-0 win against the
Montreal Expos in front of 5,132 at Olympic Stadium on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The happenings are listed in order of importance to Johnson. The
career wins are a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred or something like that would be more important
this year than 1,000,'' said Johnson, in his 13th season managing.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the 100-win mark would almost certainly assure the
Dodgers a playoff spot, but without Young in the lineup it would be
nearly impossible. Young leads the majors with 18 stolen bases and
the National League with a .443 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   He hurt the leg on a stolen base and left the game when he
hobbled to third on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably be ready when we get home,'' Johnson said. ``I
wouldn't bring him back on the Astroturf.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he'll hit former Expo Mark Grudzielanek leadoff,
especially since the shortstop went 3 for 4 and scored three times
in place of Young.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless Young can talk Johnson into playing before the
team returns to Los Angeles to face the Florida Marlins on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad (Johnson) said, `Probably,' '' Young said with a
grin. ``If I'm feeling good, I don't think he's going to keep me
out of the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also an important game for Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley,
left fielder Gary Sheffield and Park. Hundley had his first
three-hit game as a Dodger and drove in three runs. Left fielder
Gary Sheffield also had three hits and three RBI as the Dodgers
took a 1-0 lead in the first inning, extended it to 3-0 in the
fourth, added a run in the seventh off starter Dustin Hermanson
(2-3) and scored three times in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that perhaps kept Park (3-2) away from his first
career shutout was a developing blister.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Johnson opted to pull Park after seven innings in fear
the forming blister would tear and cost Park his next start. Still,
Park struck out a season-high eight and allowed five hits for his
second straight win. He's now beaten every National League team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really good before the game started,'' said Park, who
hasn't allowed a run in his last 112/3 innings. ``I was throwing a
lot of strikes with my fastball and I was throwing my curve for
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   After Young and Park, there was Johnson, the fifth active
manager and 44th all-time to reach the 1,000-win mark.
</P>
<P>
   But how important is it to Johnson? When recently quizzed, he
didn't know his first win as a major-league manager came April 4,
1984, against Cincinnati. The Mets won 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson does recall is his first game as Mets manager in
spring training. It was in St. Petersburg, Fla., though Johnson
didn't recall the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the fourth or fifth inning and my offense ran off the
field after two outs,'' Johnson said. ``I looked around and
thought, `I ain't going to last one minute in New York. I can't
believe I've got the dumbest coaching staff, and I'm the stupid
(guy) who's managing in New York.' I remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who's second among active managers with a .575 winning
percentage (1,000-738), won the 1986 World Series with the Mets.
He's been in the playoffs five times in his 10 full seasons and was
named the American League Manager of the Year when he was with the
Baltimore Orioles. He's led the Mets, Cincinnati and the Orioles to
the playoffs and finished first or second each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of milestones like the 1,000th win, I was
fortunate enough to be in New York with (Frank) Cashen, (Barry)
Larkin and (Jim) Bowden and all the guys in Cincinnati,'' Johnson
said. ``You think about the teams and how they played. You thinking
about starting 0-8 in `95 (in Cincinnati) and blowing them out of
the water and putting it all together in the second half of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the great teams with (Pat) Gillick (in Baltimore).
Those are the things you're thankful for, the opportunity to put
this (Dodger) uniform on. That's what you reflect on. When you
reach a milestone, you're forced to think about it.''

COMMENTARY: WHO NEEDS GOLD WHEN WE HAVE GREENSPAN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is gold on its way to becoming just another commodity? The
people who run the world's financial system are doing their best to
secure that fate for the metal that once was viewed as the only
``real'' money.
</P>
<P>
   The process of removing the glitter from gold has been a gradual
but inexorable one, and is one of the most telling counters to the
argument that national governments are less important in this era
of globalization. Much of the world now is quite happy to accept
the idea that a greenback backed by Alan Greenspan is just as good
as one backed by gold.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly gold's reputation as a store of value has eroded. At
the peak of the gold frenzy in 1980, an ounce of gold cost $873,
precisely that day's level of the Dow Jones industrial average. Now
the Dow is at 11,014, about 38 times higher than the $287.60 price
of gold.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that measurement understates the amount by which
stocks have outperformed gold. If you had owned stocks all those
years, you would have received substantial dividends. If you owned
a lot of gold, you got no dividends but did have to pay storage
fees for the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   That is, in fact, how the central bankers of the world look at
gold these days. Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, last week said he expects the fund to
sell gold for the first time in two decades. The Clinton
administration is pushing for such sales by the IMF to help finance
a laudable program to forgive debts owed by very poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   The money received from the gold sales is to be invested in
government securities that will provide income, and that income
will pay off the loans. The implicit assumption is that gold, which
does not pay interest, is a lousy investment.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, the Swiss electorate voted to begin
untying the Swiss franc from its gold backing. The Swiss central
bank could begin selling gold as early as next year. Once again,
the argument was that selling gold was a way to find easy money for
good deeds. To those who still view gold as the only real money,
having the Swiss defect is a bit like discovering that Rome is
embracing Protestantism. It is the last place that should happen.
</P>
<P>
   But it is happening, and it seems likely that more central banks
_ like the Australian and Dutch banks _ will join those that have
already begun selling gold.
</P>
<P>
   The argument against retaining gold is that its day is past.
Once it was useful as a hedge against inflation that would hold its
value when paper currencies did not. Now financial markets have
their own sophisticated ways, using exotic derivative securities,
to hedge against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Once gold served as protection for investors against governments
that debased their currencies. Now there is plenty of debasing
going on _ the Brazilian real is down 27 percent this year _ but
the lesson people have drawn is to believe in the dollar. There is
growing support for the idea that all of Latin America should adopt
the dollar as a currency.
</P>
<P>
   Dollarization, as that idea is called, amounts to a sort of a
gold standard without gold. There would be a universal money whose
value was based not on gold in the vaults, but on the wisdom of
Greenspan and his successors at the Federal Reserve. Few fear that
one of those successors might resemble G. William Miller, the Fed
chairman in the late 1970s who seemed to have no idea how to slow
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   If the demonetization of gold continues, the price is likely to
keep falling as central-bank sales more than offset any increase in
demand from jewelers or industrial users. That could change if it
turns out that central bankers are not the geniuses they are now
deemed to be. But for now, the world believes in Greenspan and sees
little need for gold.

KNICKS PUT CELTICS IN A CLINCH
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-CELTICS-KNICKS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By PETER MAY 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just for the record, Patrick Ewing would like you to
know a few things. He's not done. He doesn't care if you think he's
done. He doesn't care if we think he's done. And when he is done,
he'll know it.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Monday night's performance, there's still some fuel in
the tank.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing willed his Knicks to victory, a 95-88 decision over the
Celtics at Madison Square Garden that clinched a playoff spot. In
38 minutes, he had 27 points, 19 rebounds (a season high), and 2
blocked shots as New York earned a playoff spot for the 12th
straight year, the top active streak among Eastern Conference
teams. All this came on a sore left Achilles' tendon that had
knocked Ewing out of three of the previous four games. Not to
mention sore knees and who knows what else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know with Pat who's going to show up,'' said Tony
Battie, who had 14 points, 10 rebounds, and 3 blocks. ``Everybody
knows he's a great player, but sometimes he doesn't have real good
games. He might have a good game. (Monday night) was his night. He
had a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, of course, is the lightning rod for much of what has gone
awry with the Knicks this season. Critics say he won't yield his
all-consuming role in the offense and that at age 36, he doesn't
realize he's not the player he once was. He has missed 11 games
with the heel problem; the Knicks are 6-5 without him.
</P>
<P>
   But they needed him Monday night. Allan Houston had a good night
(21) and triggered the game-breaking 9-0 run down the stretch that
snapped an 81-81 tie, the third of the night. But Ewing was clearly
the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick carried us,'' Latrell Sprewell said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of his vintage performance, St. Patrick was
happy to remind skeptics, critics, and anti-Ewings of that very
fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been writing me off for a long time,'' he said. ``I
don't listen to anything you all write (sic). I believe in myself.
I don't care what they think. I don't care what any of you think. I
believe in myself. The day I don't believe in myself, that's the
day I retire. When my body is healthy, I can still perform at a
high level.''
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't healthy. That's not a trade secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows it,'' said Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy.
``That's what makes me marvel at what he can do, mindwise. His will
to be great superseded his health.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks brought in some cast members from the musical
``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' to perform before the game and at halftime. It
was a most appropriate choice. Each team had its Jekyll moments _
the Knicks led, 16-0, out of the box _ and each team had its Hyde
moments _ the Knicks blew leads of 16 points in the first quarter
and 10 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, meanwhile, got Jekyll/Hyde captain Antoine Walker
back in the lineup, but it would be a stretch to say he was back in
the game. Walker, who missed eight games with a sprained left
ankle, was predictably shaky and finished with 11 points (4 of 15),
7 rebounds, and 3 turnovers. Then again, we've seen those numbers
when he's been healthy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to get back to competition,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks trailed only once, in the second quarter by 1 point
on three occasions. They had leads of 16 in the first quarter, 12
in the third, and 10 in the fourth. The Celtics, who got 18 each
from Ron Mercer and Paul Pierce, stayed feisty to the bitter end,
rallying for 10 straight points to create the 81-81 deadlock with
5:18 to play.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine how the New York fans would have handled a
Knicks collapse with the playoffs on the line and hated Miami due
in Wednesday night for the season finale.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Houston wormed his way in for a scoop and was
fouled by Battie for a 3-point play. Mercer then threw it away and
Ewing followed with his final hoop, a jumper from the lane. Two
more Boston bricks, both by Pierce, begat Knicks hoops by Sprewell
and Houston, and the game was over. Start spreading the news.

NFL CALLING PLAY ON OWNERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK OROV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With negotiations entering a critical phase, the
National Football League has pressed its demand that it be able to
choose whatever ownership it wants for a new football franchise at
the Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Friday and obtained on Monday, NFL attorney
Frank Rothman asked Coliseum Commission President Sheldon Sloan for
more detailed information on the ability of the commission to
negotiate a deal with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Football League must have total flexibility,'' in
its ability to select an ownership group, Rothman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to earlier correspondence from Sloan in which the
Coliseum president asserted the panel was free to negotiate with
others despite a memorandum of understanding with the New Coliseum
Partnership of Ed Roski and Eli Broad allowing two years to bring a
professional team to the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said that Roski and Broad have told him they believe
they have exclusive rights to negotiation for an expansion
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disagreement between your interpretation and the
interpretation of Mr. Broad and Mr. Roski is of concern to the
NFL,'' Rothman said. ``It would be our view that this matter should
be straightened out by you and the New Coliseum Venture group.''
</P>
<P>
   The league has insisted for more than a month that it wanted to
see the Roski agreement voided, feeling it was being forced to
select the developer as an owner. Roski has said he would not be a
roadblock to the selection of an ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   However, the memorandum states he must be reimbursed up to $5
million in costs by any new team if he is not part of the
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan said he was preparing a response to Rothman insisting the
Coliseum had the freedom to accept different owners and planned to
also send the agreement to the NFL for review.
</P>
<P>
   The letter comes at a tense point as the Roski-Broad group and
one headed by Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz and food magnate Ron
Burkle are completing the business plans the NFL wants to review
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both sides indicated they plan to have their
work wrapped up late this week or early next week.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has said it will place an expansion team in the
Coliseum, but wants to reserve the right on selecting the ownership
group.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a new debate has developed over the impact of
professional football returning to the Coliseum on the University
of Southern California and the museums within Exposition Park.
</P>
<P>
   Also, questions are being asked over the level of public
involvement that will be required since the NFL has made clear it
expects a significant public investment as part of the award of any
expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has indicated a willingness to
accept what local officials have offered.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to some $348 million, including $85 million in land
value, $110 million in earthquake retrofit work on the Coliseum,
$113 million in work done on the Harbor Freeway and $20 million
from the Community Redevelopment Agency as well as $20 million in
revenue from a ticket surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Additional public funds could be needed for a parking facility.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said whoever gets the franchise would need to have
near-total control of the Coliseum for all types of events to turn
much profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at only a 1 to 2 percent return at best,'' said
one official close to the discussions. ``You have $300 million in
work to remodel the Coliseum and another $600 million to $700
million for the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a $1 billion investment that you're not going to get
back with just eight football games a year. You need to have the
right to put on soccer matches, concerts and other things to turn a
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   John Semcken, executive vice president of New Coliseum Partners,
said the group has been working with the different museums and
cultural facilities in Exposition Park as well as USC on its plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about making sure we accommodate their
ability to operate during games,'' Semcken said. ``We think the
return of football to Exposition Park will help everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan said the commission would insist that the needs of the
other tenants be assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are there and they added a huge amount of credibility to
the bid of the Coliseum,'' Sloan said. ``We benefited from those
institutions and, by the same token, a renewed Coliseum will bring
millions of new people to the park, many of whom have never been
there before. I think we will see an increase in attendance if
football returns.''

NO DEFECTS IN CUBA'S GAME
</HEADLINE>
 BB-CUBA-ORIOLES-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By STEVE FAINARU 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In a game cloaked in political symbolism, Cuba's
powerhouse national team whipped the Orioles Monday night at Camden
Yards, 12-6, in a strange exhibition that seemed to settle, at
least temporarily, the longstanding debate over whether the Cubans
can compete with major league teams.
</P>
<P>
   On March 28, Cuba lost the first game of the home-and-home
series with Baltimore, 3-2, in 11 innings at Havana. Monday night,
in their first appearance in the US since the 1959 revolution, the
Cubans hammered the worst team in the American League for 18 hits,
held Baltimore to six, and seemed to be in almost constant motion
after a 56-minute rain delay in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation had centered on how many Cubans might use the
opportunity to defect. The team's hotel crawled Monday afternoon
with Baltimore police officers, Cuban security officials, major
league scouts, and covetous agents in what seemed to be an odd
waiting game to see who might make a run for the front door.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, no one did. The Cubans clearly had come to play, not
leave their country. Omar Linares, the team's legendary third
baseman, described the game as ``a dream come true.'' By contrast,
the Orioles treated the game like a chore. Right fielder Albert
Belle told fans on his website: ``Most of us probably still would
have preferred to have the day off.''
</P>
<P>
   But he allowed that the stakes were high: ``We want to win no
matter who we're up against,'' he wrote. ``But there's also the
underlying theme that this game is about democracy vs. Communism,
so that adds a little something more to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was so, the death of communism has been greatly
exaggerated. Rumors circulated that Fidel Castro exhorted the
Cubans before takeoff Sunday. Unlike the Havana game, which several
players missed for the Cuban league playoffs, the core of the
amateur team that has dominated international play for years was
here: Linares, first baseman Orestes Kindelan, and second baseman
Antonio Pacheco, who have combined for 1,060 career homers. But the
barrage was led by the No. 9 hitter, Danel Castro, who went 4 for 5
with two triples.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Orioles removed their five starting pitchers
from the roster. They started a pitcher who is on the disabled
list, Scott Kamieniecki. Still, the starting lineup included Brady
Anderson, B.J. Surhoff, Belle, Harold Baines, and Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans started righthander Jose Conteras, who dominated the
Orioles in Havana. Conteras faltered after 2 1/3 innings, but Norge
Vera, a 28-year-old sidearming righthander, didn't give up a hit
for the next two hours. He lasted until the ninth, when he tired
and gave up a three-run homer to Delino DeShields. He struck out
Belle, who seemed utterly uninterested, twice.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the event seemed evident most of the day. At a
morning news conference, Humberto Rodriguez Gonzalez, the Cuban
sports minister, refused to answer a question from a reporter for
Radio Marti, the anti-Castro radio station. The press conference
became heated when Rodriguez was asked about German Mesa, who was
left off the trip, even though many still believe he is the finest
shortstop in the history of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, along with pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez and
catcher Alberto Hernandez, had been banned in 1997 for allegedly
plotting to defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, discipline is a key fact of sports, and discipline
doesn't have a name,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom does,'' said the questioner, a Miami television
reporter, before the debate was cut off by Orioles spokesman John
Maroon.
</P>
<P>
   But the political moment of the evening came in the top of the
fifth, when a man ran on the field and waved a sign that read,
``Freedom! Strike Out Castro.'' Cesar Valdez, the Cuban second base
umpire, intercepted the man in short center field, picked him up,
and body-slammed him to the ground before an army of police
officers and plainclothes Cuban security agents wrestled him to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of protesters _ both anti-Castro and anti-embargo _
gathered outside before the game but did nothing to stop a capacity
crowd from pouring into Camden Yards. Even Joe Cubas, the
Miami-based agent who vowed last week to bag another defector, was
nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if one of them wanted to leave, they'd have to be
Superman,'' said Mike Brito, a Cuban-born scout, standing outside
the Sheraton. ``They'd have to crash through that window right
there.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ The way Chris Holt feels, he's not digging early holes
for himself. They're more like craters.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holt spotted the New York Mets a four-run advantage after the
first inning Monday night, and the Astros again ran out of time to
crawl out in a 5-3 loss at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, only the Astros' third in their last 11 games, snapped
their season-high four-game winning streak. And New York continued
to be one of the hottest teams in baseball, extending its winning
streak to six.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first inning is killing me,'' said Holt, who allowed four
hits, a walk and a hit batsman in the first. ``I've been putting us
out of the game. You can't put your team in a hole 4-0 and expect
it's going to be easy to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially on a night when the Astros struggled to generate any
offense. They finished with their second-lowest hit total (six) of
the season, and the top four men in the lineup went a collective
2-for-14 with five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   New York righthander Rick Reed, making his first start since
being placed on the disabled list with a slightly torn calf muscle
April 12, allowed three runs and five hits while striking out six.
At one point, Reed (2-0) retired 11 straight batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised we didn't find a way to score some more runs,''
said Astros manager Larry Dierker, whose team entered the game with
a National League-leading .295 batting average. ``You can't explain
everything. I can explain why they hit Chris, because he got behind
in the count and threw the ball down the middle. I can't explain
why we didn't do a little bit better against Reed.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Holt (0-4) is still searching for his first victory
since Aug. 21, 1997. He missed all of last season after undergoing
rotator-cuff surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The source of his latest problems was a familiar one. Holt left
pitches high and over the plate during a 40-pitch first inning. He
has allowed nine runs in the first inning this season.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeo led off the New York first with a single, John
Olerud walked two batters later, and Mike Piazza delivered an RBI
single through the hole at shortstop to put the Mets ahead 1-0.
Robin Ventura loaded the bases with a single, and Holt pushed
across a run when he hit Mike Kinkade.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McRae added a two-run single to put the Mets in front 4-0.
The Mets sent nine batters to the plate in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to control my adrenalin,'' said Holt, who in five
starts has allowed 21 runs in 28 innings. ``I'm leaving pitches up
and making bad pitches. You give up runs when you do that. I can't
live up there. It's easy to stay downstairs (in the strike zone)
and then come up if you have to. But when you're staying up, it's
harder to come down, and that's one thing I have to get mentally in
my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt allowed five runs, eight hits and four walks in six
innings. After the first, he settled down to allow only one run and
four hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big hurdle with him is we have to get him a win,'' Dierker
said. ``He's throwing the ball really well, but he hasn't had a win
in over a year. It's been a long time since he's had that winning
feeling. If we can get him back in the winner's circle, I think we
are going to have ourselves a pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros got one run back in the second inning when Ken
Caminiti led off with a walk, advanced to second on a single by
Paul Bako and scored on a two-out single by Holt.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was nearly untouchable over the next three innings,
allowing just a single to Derek Bell in the third before Richard
Hidalgo's two-run homer in the sixth pulled the Astros within 4-3.
The 402-foot shot to left-center field was Hidalgo's sixth homer
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said the long layoff factored into his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time I've been on the DL,'' Reed said. ``It
seemed like forever. It was tough waiting. I just wanted to go out
there and pitch at least six innings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets pushed their lead back to two runs in the sixth when
Cedeo led off with a double, stole third and scored on Edgardo
Alfonzo's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Think Reed was tough for the Astros? Try facing the Mets'
bullpen, which pitched three scoreless innings to lower its NL-best
ERA to 2.50. Turk Wendell pitched two scoreless innings, and John
Franco pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   With Craig Biggio at first, the Astros had the tying run at the
plate in the seventh against Wendell. But Bell struck out for the
third time in the game and seventh in his last nine at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be able to score Holt some runs,'' Biggio said.
``But tonight we just didn't give him enough.''

CUBAN NATIONAL TEAM CRUSHES ORIOLES, 12-6 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Baltimore Orioles on Monday night took one small
step for international diplomacy and one huge step for their own
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The team that already had the second-worst record and the
second-highest payroll in the major leagues pitched poorly, hit
ineptly and fielded sloppily as the Cuban national team won a
historic exhibition game, 12-6, in the second game of the
home-and-home series between the teams. The Cubans outhit the
professionals, 18-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who barely won the first game in 11 innings in
Havana on March 28, should be grateful that no third game is
scheduled. Their manager, Ray Miller, should be grateful if he does
not lose his job over Monday night's debacle. Already teetering on
the brink of dismissal, Miller could find out quickly that this
game was the one that prompted Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner,
to take the step that he has been reluctant to take.
</P>
<P>
   A Camden Yards crowd of 47,940, including a small knot of
exuberant Cubans seated behind their team's third-base dugout,
watched the Orioles disintegrate before their very eyes as the
Cubans outplayed them in every aspect of the game. ``I thought we
were geared up for the game,'' Miller said. ``Then the rain delay,
and they threw six runs up on the board. Obviously their desire was
much better than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Contreras, the pitcher who in relief allowed two hits and
struck out 10 in eight innings in Havana, faltered as the starter
this time, giving up three runs in one and one-third innings that
included a 56-minute rain delay. But just as he bailed out Jose
Ibar, the first-game starter, he himself was rescued on Monday
night by Norge Vera, a 27-year-old right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 Vera even outdid the Contreras relief performance,
permitting the Orioles no hits in his first seven innings. He
finally weakened in the ninth as the Orioles rapped three
consecutive hits, the last a home run by Delino DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry, however, made no dent in the outcome. Vera entered
the game in the second inning with two runners on, one out and the
Cubans ahead, 4-3, and shut down the Orioles while his hitting
teammates increased their lead. ''He was throwing breaking balls,
offspeed pitches, keeping his pitches down, throwing strikes on the
first pitch,'' Miller said, explaining Vera's success.
</P>
<P>
   Danel Castro, whose presence at shortstop in place of the almost
legendary German Mesa prompted some question and suspicion before
the game, justified his selection by collecting four hits,
including a pair of triples, scoring four runs and driving in two.
He singled in one time at bat in Havana, giving him five hits in
six tries against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the $13 million-a-year Albert Belle failed to get a
hit in three at-bats, striking out twice. In two games, he struck
out four times and got no hits in eight at-bats, failing to get the
ball out of the infield even once.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans applied the coup de grace in the ninth inning with a
finishing barrage of four extra-base hits and five runs against
Gabe Molina, the fifth and last Baltimore pitcher. The first hit
was Castro's second triple, the last a three-run home run over the
right-center field fence by Andy Morales, the Cubans' designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, in absolute shock and ecstasy, ran around the bases in
a manner not seen in major league games. He held his arms
outstretched most of the way, clapped, appeared to be flying,
motioned to the Cuban delegation sitting behind the Cubans' third
base dugout and as he neared home plate with arms outstretched,
looked skyward. His teammates, who had burst out of the dugout,
mobbed him.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, the Cuban players gathered in the infield
and held two Cuban flags. The Orioles then emerged from their
dugout, to some boos, and the teams shook hands with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, other people went onto the field, though none was in
uniform. Five fans in all went onto the field, the first carrying a
small Cuban flag. Police calmly walked after the four interlopers
in the fourth inning, grabbed them and took them off the field.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the Cubans' fifth inning, another fan carrying a
small sign jumped onto the field and ran past second base. Cesar
Valdez, one of three Cuban umpires in the game, tackled the fan and
slammed him to the ground. They began tussling, and policemen
quickly rushed to the scene and pulled them apart.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff, the Orioles' left fielder, also ran to the spot
and appeared to keep one of the other Cuban umpires from becoming
involved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the game, Alfonso Urquoila was asked about the selection
of the 25-man roster, specifically why Mesa was not on the team.
``He was in the training sessions,'' Urquoila said. ``We have a lot
of good players. We took players who were in better condition right
now. I believe both shortstops we brought are in better condition
right now. They are the youngest players on the whole team. Both
are 22 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro was listed as 22 on the roster, but Michel Enrique, the
other shortstop, was listed as having been born in 1969, making him
30.
</P>
<P>
   Urquiola also said that Cuban officials were not leary of
possible defections, which have wracked the Cuban national team in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would feel if a Cuban player went into the
Baltimore dugout for a foul pop and did not come back, he said,
``We have no fear; we are not concerned about it. We let them play
freely on the field and we have no concern about it. We have no
fear. Otherwise we wouldn't be here.''

CALLERS COMPLAIN THAT NBC'S `NOAH' STRAYS FROM BIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ NBC apologized Monday to viewers who flooded the
network and its affiliates with complaints about the adaptation of
Bible stories in the much-hyped ``Noah's Ark'' miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what I was seeing,'' said Jane Jason, 74.
``They called it `Noah's Ark,' but they didn't show the story of
Noah.''
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries placed Noah (Jon Voight) at the scene of the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, an event the Bible says actually
happened hundreds of years after the great flood.
</P>
<P>
   NBC _ which prefaced both halves of the program Sunday and
Monday with a disclaimer stating ``dramatic license'' had been
taken with some of the events depicted _ issued a statement saying
it ``apologizes if any viewers found the treatment of the material
objectionable.'' A representative said the network had received
fewer than 100 negative calls about the show, but that more than
1,000 people had phoned to order videotapes of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints, Sunday's opening installment of the
miniseries garnered 50million viewers, the highest overnight rating
for a movie on any network this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was misleading,'' Jason said. ``Now, if NBC gives me the
news on Kosovo, I'll think they're only trying to make it dramatic.
There was no need to do this _ no rhyme or reason. I was very
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Renee Porter of Canoga Park, Calif., said she left a message
with NBC voicing her disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's meaning behind the story of Noah's ark, and to have
them portray it all jumbled up with Sodom and Gomorrah for
entertainment purposes is not right,'' she said. ``Why does NBC
assume it's OK to tell a lie when the Bible says you shouldn't lie
in the first place?''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has a problem with the miniseries, dubbed ``a
cautionary tale'' by its producers, who say the story warns that
mankind should take better care of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tom Rausch, chairman of the theological studies
department at Loyola Marymount University, believes Bible stories
are ripe for dramatic retelling _ even if they are offered in
somewhat jumbled fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, the Bible isn't really history,'' he said.
``It's a number of stories, plus historical material and other
material that should be characterized as stories. I really don't
have a problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, NBC concedes that dramatic and historical license
was taken with the miniseries but insists the show ``remains
faithful to the essential spirit and values of faith and humanity
reflected in the story of Noah.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Voight, the show starred Mary Steenburgen, F. Murray
Abraham and Carol Kane.
</P>
<P>
   Steenburgen, who played Noah's wife, Naamah, said while a good
deal of research went into NBC's ``Noah's Ark,'' the story doesn't
correspond completely with the biblical version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it 100percent exactly the way everybody's going to expect
it to be?'' she said in a statement. ``No, it isn't. (But) I think
our task is to make something that inspires people, that makes
people think, that makes people go back and examine the story
themselves, to search for the meaning.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CUBA GAME COULD OPEN SOME DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 5th graf for updating, rewriting) (lh) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The orange and black banners were hanging, giving a
festive feel to a soggy day.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   This was not New York or Cleveland coming in for a big game.
This was the national team of Cuba. Salsa music danced out of the
Camden Yards loudspeakers, turning the arcade and the old brick
factory behind right field into a Latin plaza.
</P>
<P>
   When they hang out the bunting for the World Series, they don't
mention the opponent. It's just generic decoration. This was
different. This was one of the grand old baseball cities _ Wee
Willie, the Babe, Earl, Frank and Brooks _ playing host to a
baseball nation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing they don't have automatic relegation in
baseball, the way they do in world soccer leagues, because the
inept Orioles would be good candidates for demotion after Monday
night's embarrassment, a 12-6 Cuba victory that more than made up
for the taut 3-2 Orioles victory on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we all will win,'' said Omar Linares, the superb
Cuban third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   But who really wins from this strange little sequence? You could
almost hear the baseball scouts salivating over the talent that
Cuba saw fit to load onto the plane. They would love to pick off a
few, to slip a few business cards into a few willing palms, but
what does that prove? Is there some bigger picture here?
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans with memories of their homeland may fear that a
baseball relationship would only strengthen Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to say that a mere game or two cannot balance out
four decades of political repression in Cuba, economic sanctions
that the United States has imposed on Cuba, mutual bad blood.
</P>
<P>
   But there they were, big-timers with more than a bit of swagger,
in their glittering blue jackets, white pants and bright red ball
caps, playing in Camden Yards, a trifle more solemn than visitors
for a World Series, but ballplayers nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it sounded just like any other big sporting event,
with American sportswriters asking Alfonso Urquiola, the roly-poly
Cuban manager, why he had omitted this player or that player from
the road squad.
</P>
<P>
   Just the words ``Los Hermanos Hernandez _ the Hernandez
Brothers'' conjure up the specter of defection, but Urquiola
sounded like every other touchy manager when he said, ``I thought I
already explained that.'' Still, it was more than a game, it was a
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to be said for gestures _ the nod, the smile,
the word, the phrase that just might lead to something better.
There is something to be said for gestures like Preacher Jackson
going into Serbia and bringing back three captured American
soldiers, making sure they are safe at home, and then letting the
politicians argue about who is using whom.
</P>
<P>
   What is the endgame for this little home-and-home gesture? Why
would Fidel Castro even permit the American professionals to play
his state-supported amateurs? What could be worth the intense
security, the fears of defection, even the possibility of
ignominious defeat? What's in it for Fidel?
</P>
<P>
   Here they were, the cream of the international baseball circuit,
big-timers who play teams from Russia, Japan, Mexico, the Dominican
Republic, Australia. This summer they will go to Winnipeg for the
Pan American Games. These guys get around.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   If they were flabbergasted by the amenities of a chain hotel
alongside the glitzy renovated harbor, they were not about to let
on. Did they glance at the varieties and the prices of a
room-service menu? On the other hand, did they catch a glimpse of
America's poverty outside their bus window? They were not saying,
but they did not shy away from the impulses of their baseball
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are changes taking place,'' said Luis Ulacia, an
outfielder with a firm jaw and an appraising glance. ``We do not
rule out that Cuban players will play professionally some day. It
all depends on change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish not to be forced to defect,'' Ulacia said, talking
about joining the majors some day. ``It would be a beautiful
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would play for free, just to prove himself, Ulacia
brought up the U.S. sanctions. ``Because of the blockade, I believe
it would be difficult. If they gave us the opportunity to play, I
believe the Treasury Department would not let us get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulacia was making propaganda. There is plenty of that between
the countries. What is needed is the next step _ a series in
November, maybe, or a few Cuban players allowed to earn salaries in
the majors. There is something to be said for gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Welcomes Cuba.

XIRCOM SHARES REBOUND FROM FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares in Xircom Inc. rose more than 14 percent
Monday after the Thousand Oaks-based company announced a new line
of modems and investment bank CIBC Oppenheimer initiated coverage
of the company's stock with a ``strong buy'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   The stock rose by $3.1875, or 14.17 percent, to $25.6875. More
than 1 million shares were traded, roughly 50 percent more than the
issue's 30-day average volume.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the positive rating, analyst Martin Pyykkonen at
CIBC Oppenheimer projected a $40 per share 12-month target price
for Xircom stock. While the New York-based investment bank has
tracked Xircom for several years, it had dropped official coverage
when a previous analyst left the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of confidence was welcome news to the Thousand Oaks
company. Xircom stock had been on the decline for two months,
falling from a peak of about $46 in early February to as low as
$18.8125 on April 7. While the company's financial performance has
been strong so far in 1999, its shares have suffered collateral
damage from two separate quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The first concern came in February when 3Com Corp., maker of the
popular Palm Pilot digital assistant and a Xircom competitor in the
modem arena, warned that its own earnings were suffering from
declining margins and disappointing sales. 3Com hinted its problems
were being felt across the industry, causing concern among
investors that Xircom also would be hit.
</P>
<P>
   That proved not to be the case. Xircom announced second-quarter
earnings of $10.8 million, a 227 percent gain over the previous
year and a $1 million boost over the first quarter that ended Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
   ``3Com's financial performance has not been good, and the most
comparable industry constituent ... is 3Com,'' said analyst Phil
Leigh at investment bank Raymond James. ``But that's an invalid
assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   The other trouble for Xircom came when No. 1 computer maker
Compaq Computers missed analysts' earnings expectations, leading to
the ouster of the company's chief executive and chief financial
officer. That sent shivers throughout the computer sector,
touching, among others, Xircom.
</P>
<P>
   ``My basic stance is not that there's some new information out
there on Xircom, but that two extraneous events that don't relate
to the company affected its price,'' Pyykkonen said.
</P>
<P>
   Xircom announced before the market opened Monday that it has
entered the hand-held personal-computer market with a new line of
modems for computers operating on the Windows CE platform. The PC
cards provide modem, Ethernet and wireless connections to data
networks. Analysts said sales of the devices will have little
impact initially on Xircom earnings, but as sales of personal
digital assistants increase, so too should sales of the
peripherals.

SALMON INJURED IN LOSS TO CHICAGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels' road trip that will bring
Mo Vaughn back to Boston will begin without Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels learned after Monday afternoon's 8-1 loss to the
Chicago White Sox that Salmon probably will miss three games in
Detroit with a sprained left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, the club leader in batting average (.347), home runs (7)
and RBI (25), was injured in the fourth inning diving for Paul
Konerko's soft liner to right.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon remained in the game, but left in the fifth and was taken
to UC Irvine Medical Center. X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a day out or two or maybe three, I can live with
that,'' Salmon said. ``It's a little swollen and the doctor said it
probably would be really stiff tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon dove for Konerko's ball on his left side and nearly
jammed his knee in the turf. But he rolled his wrist trying to
break the fall. The ball rolled to the wall for a triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw the play, I thought he hurt his leg,'' said
manager Terry Collins, who raced to right field with trainer Ned
Bergert. ``When I heard the X-rays were negative naturally I was
relieved. We would go on without him because we have to, but, jeez,
I don't even want to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon missed 26 games last season with a strained left arch.
With Mo Vaughn expected to return to first base during the trip,
the Angels could move Garrett Anderson from center field to right
and Darrin Erstad from first base to center. Vaughn, who has been
the Angels DH since returning from the disabled list (sprained left
ankle) April 22, still is hobbled by the injury.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick Hits:Left-hander Scott Schoeneweis replaced Tim Belcher
with one out in the fourth and allowed just one run in 32/3
innings. It was the longest outing of his three-week major league
career. . . . White Sox' left-fielder Jeff Abbott started Belcher's
undoing by opening the fifth with a home run that just cleared the
fence in left field. ``I didn't think it went out but it was so
high, it took forever before I knew,'' he said. About Belcher,
Abbott said, ``He got hurt by a couple of infield hits, but he also
threw some pitches right down the middle.'' Belcher is signed
through the next year at $5 million per season. . . . With a double
in the first inning, Chicago first baseman Frank Thomas broke Hall
of Famer Luke Appling's club record of 587 extra-base hits. Appling
did it in 2,422 games. It took Thomas 1,258. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

   A band of vicious tornadoes streaked through Oklahoma and into
Kansas on Monday, killing at least 30 people and injuring hundreds.
The storms destroyed more than 600 homes, flattened entire towns
and scattered cars on highways like pins in a bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   At least 24 people were dead in Oklahoma and 6 in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of anything like this,'' Gov. Frank Keating
of Oklahoma told CNN on Monday night. ``The extent of the
devastation is unprecedented. Perhaps Alabama in the near past
would be close, but these are some of the biggest tornadoes that
have ever been reported here.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating called in the National Guard and estimated property
damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Of those dead in Oklahoma, eight were killed in Chickasha, eight
in Oklahoma City, four in Midwest City, three in Moore, and one in
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said there were probably 10 to 20
separate tornadoes, the offspring of at least half a dozen tornadic
thunderstorms. The storms first struck about 80 miles southwest of
Oklahoma City around 5 p.m., the weather service said, and moved
northeast, through Chickasha, Norman, Oklahoma City and its
suburbs, and then fanned out northeast and northwest of Oklahoma
City.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service classified the Oklahoma tornado as at least
F-4, the second-strongest tornado classification.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Woodall, the warning coordination meteorologist for the
National Weather Service in Forth Worth, Texas, said that some of
the tornadoes were a half-mile wide. Spring is tornado season on
the Plains, Woodall said, but the storms seldom hit this hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're having tornadoes in May is not that
significant,'' he said. ``The significance is the number and the
amount of damage we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodall said that as the strom system continue to move north
through the night, more tornadoes were likely.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a suburb just south of Oklahoma City, was one of towns
hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes caused widespread blackouts and ruptured natural
gas lines, raising the specter of deadly fires and hampering rescue
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Johnson, an emergency medical technician who lives in
Oklahoma City, said that when he went to Moore to help the victims
there, ``They made us leave because of the gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Austin, a Moore resident, huddled in a neighbor's storm
shelter as the tornado passed overhead. ``Basically it was a very
large black wall that just moved here,'' he told CNN. .
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear the snapping and metal buildings rolling
around,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   When he ventured outside afterward, he said, he saw a landscape
that was ``totally flat, with no walls standing. Just rubble, with
cards thrown on them. People bleeding with head injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras showed footage of parents in Oklahoma City
searching frantically for children amid leveled homes and mangled
cars.
</P>
<P>
   In Sedgwick County, Kan., which includes Wichita, 6 people were
confirmed dead as of 11:45 p.m. and at least 50 were injured, said
Fred Ervin of the Sedgwick County Emergency Preparedness Office.
</P>
<P>
   Several mobile homes in south Wichita were blown into a lake and
several other homes were damaged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, with the strong winds and heavy rains we had power
lines down, trees down in the roadway, that's all part of tornadic
activity,'' Ervin said. ``We had funnels that touched down in
several locations.''
</P>
<P>
   The county declared a state of disaster emergency, essentially
an appeal to the state to open the National Guard Armory in the
southern part of Wichita for use as as emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas and Oklahoma are two of the four states in what is known
as Tornado Alley, an area where tornadoes often hit in the spring.
The other states are Texas and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Penn, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management
Agency regional office in Denton, Texas, said the government was
mobilizing helicopters to help in search and rescue, and agency
officials were rushing to Oklahoma early Tuesday to aid local and
state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any preliminary damage estimates because the
situation is so dynamic,'' Penn said. ``We'll have a better idea
when the morning sun comes up and we can take a look around.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Galuszka, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross in
Wichita, said that Haysville, a suburb 15 minutes south of Wichita,
was hit especially hard, with reports that all electricity was out
and roads were blocked. She said that the Red Cross had set up two
shelters in Haysville and one in Wichita but that it was advising
residents to bring their own flashlights and sleeping gear.

LAKERS RAILROAD DALLAS

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Dallas Mavericks are the loose spike in
the track that derails runaway trains. In the last two weeks, the
going-nowhere Mavs have jarred the playoff paths of San Antonio,
Phoenix, Minnesota and Houston (twice).
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers managed to avoid simulating a wayward
Amtrack on Monday, but not without rattling around the rails for
three quarters against Don Nelson's plucky underdogs before
emerging with a 115-102 victory at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   It took a late re-appearance by Shaquille O'Neal to finish the
job. The Lakers had built a 20-point lead by late in the third
quarter, earning O'Neal a long breather on the bench, where by all
rights he should have stayed for the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But by early in the fourth quarter, Dallas had cut the lead to
88-78 and coach Kurt Rambis had to agree with the crowd chants of
``We want Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal returned with 9:45 left and four minutes later, after a
series of 3-pointers from Rick Fox and Derek Harper, the Lakers had
restored a comfortable 20-point lead to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike recent O'Neal-Kobe Bryant productions, this Lakers win
featured more of an ensemble cast. O'Neal got his 26 points and 11
rebounds, and Bryant scored 17 points to go with a career-high 10
assists, but there were plenty of supporting performances: Glen
Rice's 20 points, Derek Fisher's 10 points and eight assists, Rick
Fox's 11 points off the bench, including eight in the fourth
quarter, and Derek Harper's eight-point fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And when things got boring at the end, rookie crowd-pleaser
Tyronn Lue turned on the Forum faithful with a few quick bursts and
four points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot better than 50 percent for the second time in
three games and collaborated for 30 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of impressive wins over Portland and
Seattle, Monday's victory gave the Lakers their first three-game
winning streak since late March. They've only won four in a row
once this season, during their 10-game winning streak, but they'll
probably need a fourth straight victory _ against Portland in the
season finale _ to guarantee home-court advantage in the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   At 30-19, the Lakers are a half-game up on the fifth-seeded
Houston Rockets, their first-round opponent, and hold the
tiebreaker edge after winning the season series 2-1. But the
Rockets have probable victories in their final two games, at home
against Minnesota and at Denver, so the Lakers will almost
certainly need to beat the Blazers at the Forum on Wednesday to
retain the fourth seed.
</P>
<P>
   The game started as most recent Lakers games have _ with a
first-quarter deficit. After taking an early 18-10 lead the Lakers
got soft on defense, and the Mavericks, behind Michael Finley,
charged back with a 10-3 run to pull within a point and eventually
grabbed a 29-25 lead by the end of the opening period. That
momentum carried into the next quarter, as Dallas mounted a 13-0
run from late in the first quarter to early in the second to
increase its lead to nine points.
</P>
<P>
   That was all it took to snap the Lakers out of it. Rick Fox hit
a 3-pointer to start a 14-4 run that gave the Lakers a 43-42 lead
with five minutes left in the half, and the teams traded the lead
five times before Dallas took a 57-55 lead into halftime.

SECURITY IS TIGHT FOR CUBA-ORIOLES GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ As different as the atmosphere felt on Monday night
inside Camden Yards, where the Baltimore Orioles completed their
home-and-home series with the Cuban national team, so it was on the
streets beyond the gates.
</P>
<P>
   For one unmistakable change, the downtown stadium was awash in
police protection, with more than three times the usual number of
patrol officers assigned to an Orioles home game. ``The normal
complement is 44,'' said Col. Bert Shirey of the Baltimore Police
Department, who served as commander of the stadium contingent.
``Today we have 140.''
</P>
<P>
   If it seemed, at times, like 1,040, it was only because of the
explosive nature of Cuban-American politics and the local
authorities' expectations that more than 2,000 protesters planned
to attend, at least to make their cases outside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said usual procedures were in place in case
anyone from the Cuban delegation defected, as some athletes have
done in the past after appearances in the United States and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans brought a 300-member delegation made up of team
members, sports officials, government officials, youths, athletes
from other sports and security personnel. They arrived in Baltimore
Sunday night and checked into a hotel on the inner harbor; a Cuban
official said the players stayed at the hotel all day until coming
to the ball park. A Cuban youth team played a local Little League
team on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Shirey said the police were helping to protect the Cuban
contingent until its expected departure on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By game time, the hundreds of those outside the ball park
opposing the game as a propaganda coup for the Cuban president,
Fidel Castro, far outnumbered those favoring the end of the 40-year
trade embargo by about 4-1. There were many speeches, signs, chants
and songs by the larger group, but the protests were relatively
tame.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were arrested after running onto the field during
the game, the first of them carrying a small Cuban flag and
several, according to the police, wearing ``Freedom for Cuba''
T-shirts. A fifth was detained, then released. All were chased down
by police officers and escorted off the field in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The four people, all from Miami, were ``criminally cited and
released'' and must return here for trial. In addition, 19 people
were ejected for various disorderly conduct behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore has grown used to large-scale international political
events. Three years ago, a Sunday afternoon visit by Pope John Paul
II required the same kind of coordinated effort that the Cuban team
necessitated, Shirey said. And during a 1991 visit to the United
States, Queen Elizabeth took in an Orioles game.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the Baltimore police worked with state and federal
law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, said, ``This is in a class
by itself,'' assessing the security. But he added that the State
Department did not necessarily expect defections.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore authorities also arranged with the Federal Aviation
Administration to restrict the airspace over Camden Yards from 1
p.m. to midnight to keep away what they feared would be a traffic
jam of small planes with trailing, and opposing, political
messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Angelos is very particular about maintaining order in the
stadium at any game,'' Shirey said, referring to the Orioles'
owner, Peter Angelos. ``He likes to maintain a family atmosphere.
No nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   For hours before the game, the plazas ringing the ball park were
filled not only with the usual mob of Orioles fans, even in this
season of constant losses, but also with hundreds of Cuban-born
residents of New York, New Jersey and Florida. They made up a major
part of the protesting groups. The larger group of protesters was
loud and united in its vilification of Castro as a ``traitor,
assassinator and dictator,'' as one chant went. Signs compared him
with Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader, and Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a flatbed truck parked near Babe Ruth Plaza at the
front gates, Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., one of Castro's harshest
critics in Congress, criticized the Orioles and Major League
Baseball for allowing the game to proceed. ``The game played inside
presents a vision to the world that everything inside Cuba is fine,
is normal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then referring to the Orioles' visit to Havana on March 28,
Menendez added, ``We're here to remind the nation and the world
that at the same time Castro was sitting with officials of the
Orioles and Major League Baseball, at that very time in Havana, it
was Castro sentencing leading human rights activists to long prison
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those attending the game who favored a renewal of
relations with Cuba wore red baseball hats that said, ``End the
Embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in a negotiated peace with all people we have
differences with,'' said Joyce Wheeler, an elementary school
teacher from Baltimore who equated the United States' Cuban policy
with the war in the Balkans. ``The embargo hurts women and
children. The bombing of Yugoslavia hurts women and children.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Your teen, the one living in the Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch T-shirt or
painting his fingernails black, seems to forever be behind the
closed door of his room. Should you be worried?
</P>
<P>
   Depends, according to several youth counselors, parents and
teenagers in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   How are his grades?
</P>
<P>
   Who are her friends?
</P>
<P>
   What are their interests?
</P>
<P>
   If you can answer those questions to your satisfaction, your
kid's probably OK. If you can't, you have a problem _ a
relationship problem.
</P>
<P>
   You need to become more engaged in your child's life, parents
and counselors agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``1999 is not a good time to not know what your kid's doing,''
said David Shuff, head counselor at Shepherd Junior High School in
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing can drive a parent to distraction, especially in
light of the Littleton, Colo., tragedy. No doubt many are thinking
along the same lines as President Clinton, who said, ``This should
be a wake-up call for all parents.''
</P>
<P>
   No parent suspects her child of making pipe bombs in the
bedroom, but, still, what is going on in there?
</P>
<P>
   One way to find out is dubbed ``parental espionage.'' That
generally means snooping, but can go so far as to include telephone
taps, hidden video cameras, Internet-use monitors, barging into a
teen's room unannounced or sneaking a peek at her diary.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions vary on these tactics. ``Never,'' everyone agrees,
before adding, ``unless they're warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids deserve the same degree of privacy as adults,'' said
Chris Yager, who counsels youth at Adobe Mountain and Black Canyon
detention centers. ``But if there's some suspicion. . . . It's the
same as with our homes and the police. They can't come in unless
they have probable cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Froemming, a 17-year-old junior at the Heritage Academy
charter school in Mesa, says privacy is not a problem at his house,
even though his parents routinely go into his room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My room is open to them because I'm living in their house,''
he said. ``But if I wanted to stay in my room and not be bothered
by anyone, that's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Jennifer Froemming, doesn't hesitate to enter
Brandon's room. ``I think it's the parents' responsibility to know
what your children are doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying you go in and read their diaries. But if I see
a change in their demeanor over a period of time, then I might. I
tell them that it's not that I don't trust you, it's the society
we're living in today.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale therapist Francis Mills-Yerger said, ``You need to
respect your child's privacy, but you need to know there's a
difference between privacy and secrecy. When they hide something
and keep it secret, it's because it's bad or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The doors are almost never closed in Linda Candelario's West
Valley home. That doesn't bother her 16-year-old daughter, Merie.
She has privacy when she wants it. The key to her relationship with
her parents, the Dysart High School junior said, ``is that we have
an open relationship. I can talk to (them) about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting to that point would solve most parent-teen problems, the
counselors said. ``Finding out what they're doing, who they're
doing it with, what their interests are, that's No. 1,'' Yager
said.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have that kind of relationship with your teen, how
do you get it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing a lot of overreacting,'' Shuff said. ``It's hard,
especially with adolescents, to drastically change anything. I see
that in divorce situations. A dad's never had a relationship with
the kids, and now, boom, he wants to be a part. The kids go,
`What's going on?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yager said it starts with simple conversations, finding out
teens' interests, their thoughts and not being judgmental when they
say something bizarre or immature. The conversations may be
one-sided at the beginning, but the teen will appreciate you taking
an interest.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Holt, 19, no longer lives at home. When she did, she said
she fell in with the wrong crowd and got into trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, she said, weren't as involved in her life as much
as she wished they had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stepdad never tried,'' she said during a recent visit to
Arizona Center in Phoenix. ``And when my mom did, he'd be jealous.
So she stopped trying.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite, parents trying too hard, can also backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``One complaint the kids have is when the parent tries to be one
of them or be cool around their friends,'' Yager said. ``They want
you involved, but at a distance. It's like, `Come to my game, but
don't talk to me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you know what they're doing and who they're with, it's OK
to back off and give them some space.''
</P>
<P>
   Being cool around your child can also be symptomatic of wanting
to be a friend rather than a parent. ``The hard part (of
parenting),'' said Jennifer Froemming, ``is setting rules and
following through. Parents today want to be kids' friends. It's
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Froemming, who has six children between the ages of 4 and 17,
works outside her home about six hours a day. She'd been a
stay-at-home mom until about 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   She said working makes it ``harder to keep the home up, but not
harder to keep tabs on the children. You have to prioritize.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Dalton of Glendale said she and her husband, Chris, both
work but are able to keep close watch on their two adolescent
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to my kids, we are very, very strict, and they can't
do a lot of things their friends can do,'' Kelley Dalton said.
``But we see a lot of parents doing as we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the counselors said parents should seek help with a
social worker at school if they have a particularly troubled
relationship with their child or if the child is very angry or
habitually lies, is cruel to animals or enjoys burning things.
</P>
<P>
   The counselor is trained in confronting teens and can check on
truancy, monitor the child in school and order a full psychological
profile, or personality testing, if warranted. &QL;

30 DEATHS REPORTED IN PLAINS TORNADOES

<P>
   A band of vicious tornadoes streaked through Oklahoma and into
Kansas on Monday, killing at least 30 people and injuring hundreds.
The storms destroyed more than 600 homes, flattened entire towns
and scattered cars on highways like pins in a bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   At least 24 people were dead in Oklahoma and 6 in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of anything like this,'' Gov. Frank Keating
of Oklahoma told CNN on Monday night. ``The extent of the
devastation is unprecedented. Perhaps Alabama in the near past
would be close, but these are some of the biggest tornadoes that
have ever been reported here.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating called in the National Guard and estimated property
damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Several hospitals in Oklahoma City and its suburbs reported
treating more than 100 wounded victims apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Of those dead in Oklahoma, eight were killed in Chickasha, eight
in Oklahoma City, four in Midwest City, three in Moore, and one in
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   In one Oklahoma City suburb alone _ Del City _ about 750 homes
were destroyed and two people were killed, officials there told
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said there were probably 10 to 20
separate tornadoes, the offspring of at least half a dozen tornadic
thunderstorms. The storms first struck about 80 miles southwest of
Oklahoma City around 5 p.m., the weather service said, and moved
northeast, through Chickasha, Norman, Oklahoma City and its
suburbs, and then fanned out northeast and northwest of Oklahoma
City.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service classified the Oklahoma tornado as at least
F-4, the second-strongest tornado classification.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Woodall, the warning coordination meteorologist for the
National Weather Service in Forth Worth, Texas, said that some of
the tornadoes were a half-mile wide. Spring is tornado season on
the Plains, Woodall said, but the storms seldom hit this hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're having tornadoes in May is not that
significant,'' he said. ``The significance is the number and the
amount of damage we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodall said that as the strom system continue to move north
through the night, more tornadoes were likely.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a suburb just south of Oklahoma City, was one of towns
hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes caused widespread blackouts and ruptured natural
gas lines, raising the specter of deadly fires and hampering rescue
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Johnson, an emergency medical technician who lives in
Oklahoma City, said that when he went to Moore to help the victims
there, ``They made us leave because of the gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Austin, a Moore resident, huddled in a neighbor's storm
shelter as the tornado passed overhead. ``Basically it was a very
large black wall that just moved here,'' he told CNN. .
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear the snapping and metal buildings rolling
around,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   When he ventured outside afterward, he said, he saw a landscape
that was ``totally flat, with no walls standing. Just rubble, with
cards thrown on them. People bleeding with head injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras showed footage of parents in Oklahoma City
searching frantically for children amid leveled homes and mangled
cars.
</P>
<P>
   In Sedgwick County, Kan., which includes Wichita, 6 people were
confirmed dead as of 11:45 p.m. and at least 50 were injured, said
Fred Ervin of the Sedgwick County Emergency Preparedness Office.
</P>
<P>
   Several mobile homes in south Wichita were blown into a lake and
several other homes were damaged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, with the strong winds and heavy rains we had power
lines down, trees down in the roadway, that's all part of tornadic
activity,'' Ervin said. ``We had funnels that touched down in
several locations.''
</P>
<P>
   The county declared a state of disaster emergency, essentially
an appeal to the state to open the National Guard Armory in the
southern part of Wichita for use as as emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas and Oklahoma are two of the four states in what is known
as Tornado Alley, an area where tornadoes often hit in the spring.
The other states are Texas and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Penn, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management
Agency regional office in Denton, Texas, said the government was
mobilizing helicopters to help in search and rescue, and agency
officials were rushing to Oklahoma early Tuesday to aid local and
state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any preliminary damage estimates because the
situation is so dynamic,'' Penn said. ``We'll have a better idea
when the morning sun comes up and we can take a look around.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Galuszka, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross in
Wichita, said that Haysville, a suburb 15 minutes south of Wichita,
was hit especially hard, with reports that all electricity was out
and roads were blocked. She said that the Red Cross had set up two
shelters in Haysville and one in Wichita but that it was advising
residents to bring their own flashlights and sleeping gear.

F-16 REPAIR SCHEDULE BLAMED IN STRING OF CRASHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BARRETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Air Force officials say at least half the recent fighter jet
crashes in Arizona could have been prevented had they acted sooner
to correct engine problems, some detected as early as 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, a half-dozen $20 million F-16 fighter jets from
Luke Air Force Base have been destroyed in crashes. Four of the
crashes were blamed on engine problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably three of four (accidents) could have been prevented
if we had taken the most aggressive action we could have a couple
years ago,'' said Robert May, who is responsible for managing Air
Force engines. ``But it is a balance of readiness, maintenance
workload and risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with shrinking budgets, the Air Force increased
inspections but delayed replacement and major repairs of parts
unless they were deemed immediate safety risks. May, the Air
Force's propulsion product group manager, said it could take as
long as four or five years to identify an engine problem, order a
new part, manufacture and test it, and install it.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of accidents _ a dozen across the Air Force
since fall _ has prompted top officials, and some legislators, to
ask for more funding and a faster schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Those requests have an added urgency after NATO officials
announced Monday that engine problems likely caused the crash of an
F-16 in Serbia on Saturday during an attack mission. The pilot was
rescued but the plane was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Air Force Whitten Peters has asked Congress for
another $127 million to speed up replacement of parts in F-16
engines used throughout the Air Force. Two of those parts have been
blamed for recent Arizona accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Even if new parts are available, May said the military does not
have the manpower or funding to install all the parts at once and
would have to ground much of the F-16 fleet to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford to do that, particularly today when we're
fighting a war,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The jet lost over the weekend in Serbia was the first F-16 to
crash in the Kosovo conflict. The Air Force is investigating the
crash and does not plan to ground nearly two dozen remaining F-16s
involved in Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   In March, it grounded 400 F-16s across the country _ half of
them at Luke _ when a fifth Luke plane crashed. Though no one has
been killed or seriously injured in the crashes, officials were
concerned enough about engine problems in Luke's F-16 fleet that a
month earlier they convened an engine summit at the Glendale base
to study the string of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we completed the review we decided it would probably be
prudent to accelerate fixes to some known problems,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt &AMP; Whitney spokesman Tim Burris defended his company's
engine, which is used in all the Luke planes, and said the company
sent inspectors to the engine summit.
</P>
<P>
   Before a Luke fighter jet crashed in December, he said it had
been nearly two years since the 220 model was blamed for an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Pratt &AMP; Whitney engine model has more than 5,000 parts and
is still considered the safest fighter engine in the Air Force, May
said. But he noted ``there are phenomena in the engines we don't
always understand.''
</P>
<P>
   At first it appeared none of the engine problems in the Luke
crashes were related. Now, officials say at least three parts of
the F-16 engines should be replaced _ the augmentor ducts,
low-pressure turbines and fan disks.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Luke lost an F-16 when some of the turbine blades
broke free. The February and March accidents have both been blamed
on cracked augmentor ducts. May said there had been at least seven
incidents across the Air Force caused by the same problems over the
past few years. In those cases, the pilots safely landed the jets.
</P>
<P>
   In the crashes involving the augmentor ducts, Luke pilots
ejected safely but the planes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got our attention,'' May said. ``We said, `Holy cow,
there's more safety risk than we thought.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance crews at Luke have increased inspections of the
ducts to the most thorough conducted ``outside of a laboratory.''
By Monday, they had reported cracks in 19 engine ducts. Those
engines were removed. Maintenance inspectors have not detected any
problems with the landing gear, which was blamed for a Luke crash
last week.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 jets, the equivalent of an entire squadron, have been
grounded at Luke until the augmentor ducts and turbine parts can be
replaced. May said 60 augmentor ducts should be ready by late
summer, but it may take four years to manufacture and replace the
ducts across the Air Force fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Luke officials hope to be first in line. In the meantime, the
base has resumed about 160 sorties a day _ just below its average
training schedule _ but the groundings have delayed training by a
week.  &QL;

SEX OFFENDER INFORMATION GOES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The eerie galleries of photos are just a few mouse
clicks away on the Internet. Rapists, child molesters and flashers
stare out from the screen. You can find their names, addresses,
ages and descriptions of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Chandler man who spent 10 years in prison for
attempted sex acts with a 10-year-old. A few more clicks lead to
the Yuma man convicted of sexual abuse and attempted sexual
assault, who was jailed two years ago for failing to register as a
sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   You can check out molesters in Michigan, rapists in North
Carolina and Alaska's 1,600-plus sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a national rush to use the Internet to alert
the public to the identities and whereabouts of registered sex
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, 15 states were listing sex offenders on Web
sites, with more in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   And where the states are lagging, counties, cities and even some
individuals are setting up the lists. Arizona's system is scheduled
to go online in January, but four cities _ Chandler, Tempe, Tucson
and Yuma _ already list offenders on their Web sites, and Phoenix
may follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Some call the Internet a powerful tool for alerting people to
potentially dangerous neighbors. In Florida, a woman discovered
that a sex offender was helping with her son's Boy Scout troop.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that Internet postings can cause more damage than
they prevent.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if a database isn't updated when a sex offender
moves, innocent people may find their address identified as the
home of a molester.
</P>
<P>
   One couple in Ann Arbor, Mich., unwittingly bought a house from
a sex offender and then found their address listed on the Internet
_ with no way to get the state to take them off the site until the
man's actual address was found.
</P>
<P>
   Other concerns range from accidentally revealing the names of
victims to creating an instant mailing list for pornographers
looking for customers.
</P>
<P>
   The sex offender Web sites aren't an electronic version of
``wanted'' posters. All the offenders have gone through the courts.
They've served their sentences or are on probation. Now their names
and addresses are registered with local law enforcement, and
they're living out in the community.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet sites typically let you search for offenders by
county, city, ZIP code or name.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outstanding medium to present information,'' said
crime prevention officer Todd Mittness, who runs the Web site for
the city of Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Florida began publishing the identities of sex offenders on the
Internet in November 1996, apparently the first state to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Legal Enforcement credits the system with
thwarting some sex offenders before they had a chance to repeat
their crimes and for catching others who had failed to register.
</P>
<P>
   One sexual predator joined a martial arts class and was becoming
very friendly with a young girl in the group. A fellow class member
recognized the man from photos on Florida's Internet site. The
predator was arrested for violating his probation, which prohibited
contact with girls younger than 16.
</P>
<P>
   The offender who volunteered for the Boy Scout troop was on
probation and forbidden to have such contact with youths. His
probation was revoked and he was sent back to prison to finish his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   California, on the other hand, steered clear of the Internet and
chose to offer access to its sex offender database through a CD-ROM
system in the offices of local law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Access is tightly controlled: You must sign a form, be 18 or
older and provide identification.
</P>
<P>
   The state wants to make sure that sex offenders themselves don't
tap into the database as a way to contact one another, team up or
swap pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Justice has set up booths at the
state fair and the Los Angeles County Fair so people can check out
the 69,000 listings on the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Van Winkle, an information officer at the Department of
Justice, was helping at the state fair when a 19-year-old woman
decided to run her boyfriend's name just for fun. Then his name and
photo popped up on the screen. She was so upset that she began
hyperventilating, and first-aid workers had to be called.
</P>
<P>
   Of some 100,000 people who have checked the database, Van Winkle
knows of four women who were stunned to find their husbands' names.
</P>
<P>
   California has its own list of success stories, which are posted
on the Internet. There was the pizza deliveryman identified as a
high-risk sex offender, and the molester who was discovered
volunteering at a public school.
</P>
<P>
   And despite California's aversion to the Internet, some of the
state's listings have been posted independently by people who think
they should be available online. Taking advantage of a loophole in
the law, they copy down the information by hand and then put it on
a Web site. So far, the state attorney general has decided not to
challenge them.
</P>
<P>
   It's so easy to pull up the identity of sex offenders with a few
keystrokes that it's easy to ignore the standard warning posted at
Internet sites: The information could be wrong or out of date.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a weeping woman called up the American Civil Liberties
Union of Florida. Her ex-husband was a convicted sex offender just
being released from prison, and it was her address that showed up
on the Internet _ even though they were divorced years ago and he
didn't live there at the time of conviction.
</P>
<P>
   If the state is going to release ``such incendiary information
that can have such devastating consequences,'' said Howard Simon,
executive director of the Florida ACLU, it ought to make sure that
it's absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Ingley, who supervises the sexual offender/predator unit,
says Florida does periodic sweeps to check addresses.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the ACLU unsuccessfully tried to block the state's
sex offender Internet site after authorities acknowledged that 20
to 40 percent of the addresses were inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Arizona started verifying the addresses of its
nearly 10,000 registered sex offenders in January, a year before
the names of higher risk individuals are scheduled to go online.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``we have to be realistic,'' said Val Biebrich,
sex offender community notification coordinator. Although the first
round is the hardest, he already sees that Arizona won't be able to
double-check most addresses more than once a year. ``You'd have to
have a staff of 30 to 40 people to do it every 90 days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides mistakes, there's the question of security.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say it's tight. In Chandler, for instance, the site
is encrypted to keep out hackers. Plus, said crime prevention
officer Mittness, who runs the site, ``I'm the only one that has
the program and the password to get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics point out that hackers have broken into some of the
most secure sites in the nation, run by the Pentagon or the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   As people learn to surf the Web to find the names of sex
offenders, pranksters and revenge seekers could set up their own
Web sites purporting to list molesters, said Kim English, research
director at Colorado's Division of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think anybody has thought this stuff through,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Orlando area, there were several incidents in which
people used information from the state Internet site to create
phony fliers naming innocent people as sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Harassment is another worry.
</P>
<P>
   Days after California released its CD-ROM, one sex offender's
car was firebombed. However, state authorities traced the explosion
to teenagers playing with fireworks in an incident unrelated to the
sex offender database.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Web sites include stern warnings that it's illegal to
use the information to harass offenders. Dallas and several other
Texas cities go a step further, requiring people who access their
sex offender site to furnish their names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Internet push are warning of serious, unintended
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Orr, executive director of the Center Against Sexual
Abuse in Phoenix, fears that the identities of victims could be
accidentally disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   While some Web sites provide only the statute that was violated,
others give more detailed descriptions of the crimes, including
descriptions of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites in Arizona reveal that in one case the victim was a
man's 15-year-old stepdaughter and in another it was the daughter
of the abuser's live-in girlfriend. One Web site discloses that the
victims were 10-year-old friends of the molester's daughter _ and
it names the tiny town where the crimes occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Florida used to include graphic descriptions of sex offenses on
its Internet site, but a year and a half ago, it switched to giving
limited information about the crime and only the general age of the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Still, victims' advocates wonder about wholesale broadcasting
the names of sex offenders when many crimes are incest. Nationally,
one in four imprisoned for sexual assault preyed on their own child
or stepchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ask ourselves, `What's the real goal here? Was this
necessary?' '' Orr said. ``Of all of the repercussions, has anyone
weighed the positive against the negative? I don't really feel that
anyone has.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is so new that it's hard to foresee how it will play
out.
</P>
<P>
   The local sex offender Internet sites in Arizona have been
online for less than a year. In talks with four offenders listed on
the Chandler and Tempe sites, none knew that their names and faces
were on the Internet, although some had heard the system was in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   None would be quoted by name. All were worried that their
families, some living out of state, would be humiliated. One
suggested that his adult son change his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outing'' people on the Internet could also thwart any
possibility of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Schroeder, associate director of the ACLU of Southern
California, argues that the probability of repeat crimes is
actually increased ``by making someone's name public and thereby
having people hound the person from community to community,
becoming a wanderer without the ability to put down roots.''
</P>
<P>
   She received a letter from a middle-age man who was convicted of
a sex crime in his early 20s, did his time in prison and went
through therapy. He's now married, with children, living in a small
coastal town where he's a successful businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he lives in terror that someone will find his name among
the list of sex offenders. ``If one person discovers he's on the
list,'' Schroeder said, ``his business, his family, his life is
ruined.''  &QL;

F-16 REPAIR SCHEDULE BLAMED IN STRING OF CRASHES 
</HEADLINE>

(Resending with dateline) 
 
 By JENNIFER BARRETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Air Force officials say at least half the recent
fighter jet crashes in Arizona could have been prevented had they
acted sooner to correct engine problems, some detected as early as
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, a half-dozen $20 million F-16 fighter jets from
Luke Air Force Base have been destroyed in crashes. Four of the
crashes were blamed on engine problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably three of four (accidents) could have been prevented
if we had taken the most aggressive action we could have a couple
years ago,'' said Robert May, who is responsible for managing Air
Force engines. ``But it is a balance of readiness, maintenance
workload and risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with shrinking budgets, the Air Force increased
inspections but delayed replacement and major repairs of parts
unless they were deemed immediate safety risks. May, the Air
Force's propulsion product group manager, said it could take as
long as four or five years to identify an engine problem, order a
new part, manufacture and test it, and install it.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of accidents _ a dozen across the Air Force
since fall _ has prompted top officials, and some legislators, to
ask for more funding and a faster schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Those requests have an added urgency after NATO officials
announced Monday that engine problems likely caused the crash of an
F-16 in Serbia on Saturday during an attack mission. The pilot was
rescued but the plane was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Air Force Whitten Peters has asked Congress for
another $127 million to speed up replacement of parts in F-16
engines used throughout the Air Force. Two of those parts have been
blamed for recent Arizona accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Even if new parts are available, May said the military does not
have the manpower or funding to install all the parts at once and
would have to ground much of the F-16 fleet to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford to do that, particularly today when we're
fighting a war,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The jet lost over the weekend in Serbia was the first F-16 to
crash in the Kosovo conflict. The Air Force is investigating the
crash and does not plan to ground nearly two dozen remaining F-16s
involved in Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   In March, it grounded 400 F-16s across the country _ half of
them at Luke _ when a fifth Luke plane crashed. Though no one has
been killed or seriously injured in the crashes, officials were
concerned enough about engine problems in Luke's F-16 fleet that a
month earlier they convened an engine summit at the Glendale base
to study the string of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we completed the review we decided it would probably be
prudent to accelerate fixes to some known problems,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt &AMP; Whitney spokesman Tim Burris defended his company's
engine, which is used in all the Luke planes, and said the company
sent inspectors to the engine summit.
</P>
<P>
   Before a Luke fighter jet crashed in December, he said it had
been nearly two years since the 220 model was blamed for an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Pratt &AMP; Whitney engine model has more than 5,000 parts and
is still considered the safest fighter engine in the Air Force, May
said. But he noted ``there are phenomena in the engines we don't
always understand.''
</P>
<P>
   At first it appeared none of the engine problems in the Luke
crashes were related. Now, officials say at least three parts of
the F-16 engines should be replaced _ the augmentor ducts,
low-pressure turbines and fan disks.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Luke lost an F-16 when some of the turbine blades
broke free. The February and March accidents have both been blamed
on cracked augmentor ducts. May said there had been at least seven
incidents across the Air Force caused by the same problems over the
past few years. In those cases, the pilots safely landed the jets.
</P>
<P>
   In the crashes involving the augmentor ducts, Luke pilots
ejected safely but the planes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got our attention,'' May said. ``We said, `Holy cow,
there's more safety risk than we thought.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance crews at Luke have increased inspections of the
ducts to the most thorough conducted ``outside of a laboratory.''
By Monday, they had reported cracks in 19 engine ducts. Those
engines were removed. Maintenance inspectors have not detected any
problems with the landing gear, which was blamed for a Luke crash
last week.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 jets, the equivalent of an entire squadron, have been
grounded at Luke until the augmentor ducts and turbine parts can be
replaced. May said 60 augmentor ducts should be ready by late
summer, but it may take four years to manufacture and replace the
ducts across the Air Force fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Luke officials hope to be first in line. In the meantime, the
base has resumed about 160 sorties a day _ just below its average
training schedule _ but the groundings have delayed training by a
week.  &QL;

LAKERS CAST OFF DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 _ WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Entertaining as it is, the Los Angeles
Lakers' two-man vaudeville act of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant
is a show with limited drawing potential. For the long haul,
they'll need an ensemble cast, so they trotted out every supporting
actor and bit player they had Monday night in a performance they
hope earns many encores.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reviews were encouraging. Every Laker who stepped on
the court scored, five in double figures, and the feel-good plot
included 31 assists in a 115-102 victory over the Dallas Mavericks
at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The critics loved it. The starring cast was pretty pleased with
itself, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always gonna be a plus for us when we can get everyone
involved,'' said Glen Rice, who snapped out of a recent funk to
score 22 points. ``I think when you just rely on two people to take
you to that finish line every time, sometimes you're gonna come up
short, but when we get everyone involved, it's been proven that
we're a much better basketball team.... Anytime you can go out
there and have as many assists as we had today, things are gonna
pretty much fall in your favor.''
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have been better timed, giving the Lakers their
first three-game winning streak since late March and pushing them a
half-game ahead of the Houston Rockets for the home-court advantage
in their first-round playoff matchup.
</P>
<P>
   If the streak can make it to four, against Portland in the
season finale Wednesday, the Lakers will start the playoffs at home
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   If the offense remains a 10-man game, good results will follow.
The Lakers' previous win, at Seattle, was all Shaq and Kobe. O'Neal
got his 26 points and 11 rebounds Monday, and Bryant scored 17
points to go with a career-high 10 assists, but this time they had
help: from Rice, from Derek Fisher's 10 points and eight assists,
Rick Fox's 11 points off the bench, J.R. Reid's nine points, and an
eight-point fourth quarter from Derek Harper.
</P>
<P>
   And when things got boring at the end, crowd-pleaser Tyronn Lue
turned on the Forum faithful with a few quick bursts of speed and
four points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know that people are finding their grooves
offensively,'' said Robert Horry. ``That's a sign that guys are
gearing up and getting ready to really buckle down and play. Here
lately everyone's scoring points, two here, four there, so it's
nice that everyone knows we're geared up for the playoffs. And nice
to know that everyone's playing as a team, passing the ball. I
think that's the most important thing. Before, we would hold it,
try and do our own thing first, then kick it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, riding a four-game winning streak coming into the game,
had been derailing playoff teams left and right in a late-season
surge, knocking off San Antonio, Phoenix, Minnesota and Houston
(twice). The Mavericks led the Lakers by two at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But then teamball took over. The Lakers outscored the Mavericks
30-15 in the third quarter and at one point built a 20-point
cushion. And, conveniently, they've never looked closer to being
ready for the playoffs than they look now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a much better team,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``But I
know we can play better. I've been telling you guys for a long
time, this team has a huge upside potential. We've seen some of it
but not all of it.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Crime of the Century
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two boys, 18 and 19, were smart, dreadfully smart. They came
from an affluent neighborhood in a big city. Their friendship was
intense and poisonous. One of the boys, the 18-year-old, seemed to
be the leader. Together, without adult supervision, they cooked up
a Nietzschean superman fantasy: their brilliance and superiority
entitled them to murder anyone they considered inferior.
</P>
<P>
   And murder they did. They picked up a 14-year-old neighbor and
killed him with a chisel. Their act was once called the Crime of
the Century, a title since appropriated for each subsequent crime
of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1924. The city was Chicago. The Crime of the
Century was the Leopold-Loeb case. The defense lawyer was Clarence
Darrow, who got his clients, Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, off
on a plea of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   There are two points to be made here about Littleton, Colo. 1)
There is nothing much new about young people drawing fatally wrong
conclusions from complicated ideas adrift in the culture. 2) What
larger deeds might Leopold and Loeb have accomplished if they had
been armed with guns instead of a chisel?

NO DEFECTS IN CUBA'S GAME

   BALTIMORE _ In a game cloaked in political symbolism, Cuba's
powerhouse national team whipped the Orioles Monday night at Camden
Yards, 12-6, in a strange exhibition that seemed to settle, at
least temporarily, the longstanding debate over whether the Cubans
can compete with major league teams.
</P>
<P>
   On March 28, Cuba lost the first game of the home-and-home
series with Baltimore, 3-2, in 11 innings at Havana. Monday night,
in their first appearance in the US since the 1959 revolution, the
Cubans hammered the worst team in the American League for 18 hits,
held Baltimore to six, and seemed to be in almost constant motion
after a 56-minute rain delay in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation had centered on how many Cubans might use the
opportunity to defect. The team's hotel crawled Monday afternoon
with Baltimore police officers, Cuban security officials, major
league scouts, and covetous agents in what seemed to be an odd
waiting game to see who might make a run for the front door.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, no one did. The Cubans clearly had come to play, not
leave their country. Omar Linares, the team's legendary third
baseman, described the game as ``a dream come true.'' By contrast,
the Orioles treated the game like a chore. Right fielder Albert
Belle told fans on his website: ``Most of us probably still would
have preferred to have the day off.''
</P>
<P>
   But he allowed that the stakes were high: ``We want to win no
matter who we're up against,'' he wrote. ``But there's also the
underlying theme that this game is about democracy vs. Communism,
so that adds a little something more to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was so, the death of communism has been greatly
exaggerated. Rumors circulated that Fidel Castro exhorted the
Cubans before takeoff Sunday. Unlike the Havana game, which several
players missed for the Cuban league playoffs, the core of the
amateur team that has dominated international play for years was
here: Linares, first baseman Orestes Kindelan, and second baseman
Antonio Pacheco, who have combined for 1,060 career homers. But the
barrage was led by the No. 9 hitter, Danel Castro, who went 4 for 5
with two triples.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Orioles removed their five starting pitchers
from the roster. They started a pitcher who is on the disabled
list, Scott Kamieniecki. Still, the starting lineup included Brady
Anderson, B.J. Surhoff, Belle, Harold Baines, and Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans started righthander Jose Conteras, who dominated the
Orioles in Havana. Conteras faltered after 2 1/3 innings, but Norge
Vera, a 28-year-old sidearming righthander, didn't give up a hit
for the next two hours. He lasted until the ninth, when he tired
and gave up a three-run homer to Delino DeShields. He struck out
Belle, who seemed utterly uninterested, twice.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the event seemed evident most of the day. At a
morning news conference, Humberto Rodriguez Gonzalez, the Cuban
sports minister, refused to answer a question from a reporter for
Radio Marti, the anti-Castro radio station. The press conference
became heated when Rodriguez was asked about German Mesa, who was
left off the trip, even though many still believe he is the finest
shortstop in the history of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, along with pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez and
catcher Alberto Hernandez, had been banned in 1997 for allegedly
plotting to defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, discipline is a key fact of sports, and discipline
doesn't have a name,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom does,'' said the questioner, a Miami television
reporter, before the debate was cut off by Orioles spokesman John
Maroon.
</P>
<P>
   But the political moment of the evening came in the top of the
fifth, when a man ran on the field and waved a sign that read,
``Freedom! Strike Out Castro.'' Cesar Valdez, the Cuban second base
umpire, intercepted the man in short center field, picked him up,
and body-slammed him to the ground before an army of police
officers and plainclothes Cuban security agents wrestled him to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of protesters _ both anti-Castro and anti-embargo _
gathered outside before the game but did nothing to stop a capacity
crowd from pouring into Camden Yards. Even Joe Cubas, the
Miami-based agent who vowed last week to bag another defector, was
nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if one of them wanted to leave, they'd have to be
Superman,'' said Mike Brito, a Cuban-born scout, standing outside
the Sheraton. ``They'd have to crash through that window right
there.''

KNICKS PUT CELTICS IN A CLINCH

 BKN-CELTICS-KNICKS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By PETER MAY 
c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just for the record, Patrick Ewing would like you to
know a few things. He's not done. He doesn't care if you think he's
done. He doesn't care if we think he's done. And when he is done,
he'll know it.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Monday night's performance, there's still some fuel in
the tank.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing willed his Knicks to victory, a 95-88 decision over the
Celtics at Madison Square Garden that clinched a playoff spot. In
38 minutes, he had 27 points, 19 rebounds (a season high), and 2
blocked shots as New York earned a playoff spot for the 12th
straight year, the top active streak among Eastern Conference
teams. All this came on a sore left Achilles' tendon that had
knocked Ewing out of three of the previous four games. Not to
mention sore knees and who knows what else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know with Pat who's going to show up,'' said Tony
Battie, who had 14 points, 10 rebounds, and 3 blocks. ``Everybody
knows he's a great player, but sometimes he doesn't have real good
games. He might have a good game. (Monday night) was his night. He
had a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, of course, is the lightning rod for much of what has gone
awry with the Knicks this season. Critics say he won't yield his
all-consuming role in the offense and that at age 36, he doesn't
realize he's not the player he once was. He has missed 11 games
with the heel problem; the Knicks are 6-5 without him.
</P>
<P>
   But they needed him Monday night. Allan Houston had a good night
(21) and triggered the game-breaking 9-0 run down the stretch that
snapped an 81-81 tie, the third of the night. But Ewing was clearly
the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick carried us,'' Latrell Sprewell said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of his vintage performance, St. Patrick was
happy to remind skeptics, critics, and anti-Ewings of that very
fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been writing me off for a long time,'' he said. ``I
don't listen to anything you all write (sic). I believe in myself.
I don't care what they think. I don't care what any of you think. I
believe in myself. The day I don't believe in myself, that's the
day I retire. When my body is healthy, I can still perform at a
high level.''
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't healthy. That's not a trade secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows it,'' said Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy.
``That's what makes me marvel at what he can do, mindwise. His will
to be great superseded his health.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks brought in some cast members from the musical
``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' to perform before the game and at halftime. It
was a most appropriate choice. Each team had its Jekyll moments _
the Knicks led, 16-0, out of the box _ and each team had its Hyde
moments _ the Knicks blew leads of 16 points in the first quarter
and 10 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, meanwhile, got Jekyll/Hyde captain Antoine Walker
back in the lineup, but it would be a stretch to say he was back in
the game. Walker, who missed eight games with a sprained left
ankle, was predictably shaky and finished with 11 points (4 of 15),
7 rebounds, and 3 turnovers. Then again, we've seen those numbers
when he's been healthy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to get back to competition,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks trailed only once, in the second quarter by 1 point
on three occasions. They had leads of 16 in the first quarter, 12
in the third, and 10 in the fourth. The Celtics, who got 18 each
from Ron Mercer and Paul Pierce, stayed feisty to the bitter end,
rallying for 10 straight points to create the 81-81 deadlock with
5:18 to play.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine how the New York fans would have handled a
Knicks collapse with the playoffs on the line and hated Miami due
in Wednesday night for the season finale.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Houston wormed his way in for a scoop and was
fouled by Battie for a 3-point play. Mercer then threw it away and
Ewing followed with his final hoop, a jumper from the lane. Two
more Boston bricks, both by Pierce, begat Knicks hoops by Sprewell
and Houston, and the game was over. Start spreading the news.

   If you thought reproducing sheep and mice was a leap ahead, you
won't believe what the Japanese have in mind: cloning a woolly
mammoth that last walked the earth during it's heyday in the

there is no science to deny the viability of the idea. The only
catch: finding a small bit of well-preserved mammoth tissue
containing normal DNA. To what lengths will the Japanese team go to

   Blended wines, such as those cheerfully thrown together by
Californians, may turn out to be top-notch, but to a Frenchman they
will lack something special _ terrior. Terrior, a vineyard's
particular combination of dirt, rock and exposure to sunlight may
leave an indelible mark on wine. Something, naturally, French
vintners have always known, but scientists are just beginning to
understand.

   If you thought reproducing sheep and mice was a leap ahead, you
won't believe what the Japanese have in mind: cloning a woolly
mammoth that last walked the earth during it's heyday in the
Pleistocene Epoch. This bizarre quest may sound unbelievable, but
there is no science to deny the viability of the idea. The only
catch: finding a small bit of well-preserved mammoth tissue
containing normal DNA. To what lengths will the Japanese team go to
realize their cloning dream?

<P>
   A broad range of individuals have gained refuge in the United
States despite evidence of their involvement in human rights abuses
elsewhere in the world. They include alleged participants of
``ethnic cleansing'' in the former Yugoslavia, former henchmen of
the murderous regime of Somali strongman Mohammed Siad Barre, and
Haitian military officers and Salvadoran generals accused of
covering up the massacre of four American churchwomen. The Boston
Globe, in a three-part series, explores the development.

<P>
   WAR-CRIMINALS-I (Port St. Lucie, Fla.) _ Carl Dorelien was once
a small-time dictator, and a proud one at that. He was part of a
clique of military officers who held Haiti at gunpoint until 1994,
when the junta's abuses became so grave that the Clinton
administration dispatched 20,000 troops to the tiny Caribbean
nation to restore order. By Steve Fainaru. PHOTO. (2 takes)
</P>
<P>
   WAR-CRIMINALS-II (PRIJEDOR, Bosnia and Herzegovina) _ Zijad
Music arrived in Burlington, Vt., directly from the war that ripped
apart his home in Prijedor in Bosnia. But Music is hardly a typical
refugee of the war in the former Yugoslavia. By Steve Fainauru.

</P>
<P>
   WAR-CRIMINALS-III (Undated) _ The United States, with no
coherent strategy, lacks resources to track suspected human rights
offenders, or investigate their crimes once they are discovered. By
Steve Fainaru. (2 takes)

   Blended wines, such as those cheerfully thrown together by
Californians, may turn out to be top-notch, but to a Frenchman they
will lack something special _ terrior. Terrior, a vineyard's
particular combination of dirt, rock and exposure to sunlight may
leave an indelible mark on wine. Something, naturally, French
vintners have always known, but scientists are just beginning to
understand.

   McCoy said most officers make their decisions immediately after
the interview. She said approval rates during the war in Bosnia
were probably ``about 99.9 percent'' because of the urgency of the
crisis. ``You have to keep in mind, these are not adversarial
relationships; you're not like an inspector at the point of
entry,'' she said. ``You're helping them to make a claim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say based on the system we have, it is likely that
someone could slip through very easily,'' she said. ``If they're
very careful and there's nothing to raise the suspicion of the
officers, they could easily lie their way through the interview.''

</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, participants in bloody ethnic cleansing operations
apparently slipped into the US among 83,247 Bosnian refugees
admitted between 1993-98. The Globe has identified two refugees in
New England and another in North Dakota who allegedly participated
in Serb operations in the early 1990s in northwestern Bosnia. A
Bosnian Serb refugee in Atlanta has been accused in a civil suit of
torturing prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Darko Maricic, a Serb journalist in the city of Prijedor, where
two of the refugees are from, said it was common for Serb
combatants to conceal their pasts from US immigration officials.
``They often lied in the embassies. I personally know a couple
people who lied,'' Maricic said. ``It was the only way to get into
the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Some refugee specialists believe the occasional admission of
human rights offenders may be worth it in the overall scheme. ``If
one out of every thousand cases might be less than pure, maybe
that's the price you have to pay,'' said Robert Carey, vice
president of resettlement for the International Rescue Committee, a
relief organization. ``I mean, how many thousands of lives have you
saved in the process?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the refugee process isn't to blame. The cases of
Haitian military officers who entered the United States following
the 1994 invasion shows how a despot with well-placed friends can
enter the country just as easily as a refugee. The most glaring
example is Emmanuel ``Toto'' Constant, who headed the Haitian death
squad FRAPH before the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   When US troops entered FRAPH's headquarters, they reportedly
found trophy photos of tortured and mutilated victims on the walls.
Constant made his way to Puerto Rico, then to New York on a
multiple-entry visa that apparently had been issued by an official
in the US consulate in Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Once detected by human rights groups, Constant's presence in New
York caused great controversy. But when the State Department moved
to revoke his visa and the INS arrested him and initiated
deportation proceedings, he filed a lawsuit, signaling his intent
to go public with the details of his longstanding relationship with
the Central Intelligence Agency. After negotiations, the State
Department stayed his deportation order, and he dropped the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The US government ``isn't about to give up what I would call
imperial sovereignty: the belief that they can do whatever they
want to do'' on foreign territory, said Michael Ratner, whose
organization, the Center for Constitutional Rights, has brought
suits against several alleged war criminals, including Constant.
</P>
<P>
   Many activists believe that the government is hesitant to
aggressively pursue human rights offenders because it would force
the United States to confront its own alliances with repressive
regimes, especially during the Cold War. The United States has been
tentative in its support of Spain's efforts to prosecute former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who ruled his nation with an
iron fist after assuming power in a CIA-sponsored coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of how to deal with human rights offenders makes many
immigration specialists uneasy, creating fears that any attempt to
fill in the cracks will only make it harder for people with
legitimate persecution claims. As a result, many people have begun
to focus on tracking them down once they settle in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But, except for OSI, the avenues for pursuing human rights
offenders have been few. US law allows victims to file civil suits
against their assailants. Legal advocates have employed the Alien
Tort Claims Act, an obscure 1789 law originally designed to
prosecute pirates, and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1992 to
bring suits against some alleged perpetrators, but the victories
have been symbolic: uncollectible financial awards against people
who have already left the country.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates like the Center for Justice and Accountability, a San
Francisco-based organization funded by Amnesty International, have
been pushing US immigration officials to move harder against people
suspected of human rights crimes. But Shawn Roberts, chief legal
counsel for the group, said US officials have responded
half-heartedly. She said a real commitment may require the kind of
lobbying effort mounted by Jewish groups that pushed the Justice
Department to create OSI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing they've entered into dialogue,'' Roberts
said, shortly after a recent meeting in Washington with US
immigration officials. ``But we'd like to see the dialogue
complemented with some action. We haven't seen that so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have argued that, with most living Nazis reaching
old age, OSI is becoming obsolete and should be expanded to include
war criminals. ``There is a so-called biological solution and
clearly that is going to happen,'' said Rosenbaum. But he said the
unit currently has 19 cases in litigation and has no plans to
change its mandate.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials said it might take years to develop the kind of
system that has been so effective for OSI. J. Kelly Ryan, who heads
the refugee and asylum law division of the INS, said the agency
hopes eventually to compile a watch list similar to the one
developed by OSI.
</P>
<P>
   But the task of hunting down modern war criminals, officials
said, is also more difficult than tracking the Nazis: Rather than
poring over documents, investigators often must track down credible
witnesses in remote countries, in highly politicized situations
that usually don't lend themselves to an accurate recounting of
events.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they are concerned about the repercussions of
deporting war criminals who could either incite more violence in
their countries, or even be tortured or killed upon their return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want these people getting jobs at Paramount Pictures
as a CEO,'' said Ryan. ``But would it be fair to dump them back
into a country and start the killing fields again?''

   ``Look, over here! Hair!'' shouts one of the sperm hunters,
pointing to a frayed brown tangle protruding from a cliff along the
Kolyma River in Siberia. When ecologist Sergei Zimov, a big-boned
Russian with a thick blond beard, gets close enough to touch the
hair, he rips a few strands free and rolls them across his fingers,
pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Could this, finally, be the hair of a woolly mammoth, its frozen
body locked inside the crumbling black cliff? Could this be the
first step in a bizarre quest led by Japanese biologists to
inseminate an Asian elephant with woolly mammoth sperm and
selectively breed a fabled prehistoric creature that became extinct
thousands of years ago? ``I know it sounds unbelievable,'' says
Kazufumi Goto, the leader of the project, ``but no science can deny
our idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimov turns the hair in his hands, rubs it between his fingers
and thumb, then poisons the air with his words: ``Steppe bison.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of the woolly mammoth was the Pleistocene Epoch,
stretching from 1.8 million years ago to the end of the last ice
age 11,000 years ago. Mammoths thrived particularly well in
Siberia, where dry grasslands once supported a vibrant ecosystem of
mammoths, bison and other jumbo herbivores. Famished after the end
of the Ice Age by a diet of low-nutrient mosses, and increasingly
harried by human hunters, the big grazers dwindled to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Although most mammoths left behind only their bones, in a few
cases the Siberian permafrost preserved mammoth skin and muscle.
Most of the cells in this tissue had degraded, but in the past
decade scientists managed to rescue a few proteins and fragmented
genes to compare with those in living elephants. And until Goto
began to think otherwise, that was about as close as anyone thought
we'd get to mammoths again.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when Goto began his career at Kagoshima
University in Japan, he applied his nascent understanding of
reproductive biology to his country's pursuit of the ultimate
steak. Goto's task was to use artificial insemination methods to
develop beef with more marbling. Getting sperm from well-marbled
bulls was easy, however, collecting cow eggs wasn't so simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going to the slaughterhouse,'' Goto says. There he
could take ovaries from cows with good marbling.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1986, while peering through a microscope at sperm
swarming an egg, Goto had an epiphany. ``Once a sperm attaches to
the egg's membrane, it stops moving,'' he says. After the two
membranes fuse, the sperm is engulfed by the egg and the tail
breaks off. It dawned on him that the sperm is already dead by the
time it is carried into the egg and delivers its genes.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Goto enlisted a student to perform a series of
experiments using dead sperm. ``We could freeze and thaw 20 times,
and the sperm DNA would never break.'' But when they tried
injecting the dead sperm into mouse eggs, it failed thousands of
times. Goto decided mouse eggs were too fragile and instructed his
student to use bull semen and cow eggs. Success: an egg divided
into an embryo. They subsequently implanted the cluster in a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got pregnant on the first try,'' Goto says.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1992 reproductive biology meeting in Fort Collins, Colo.,
Goto was peppered with questions from a reporter about the
implications of the discovery. Could viable sperm be recovered from
the Ice Man, the 5,000-year-old mummy that had just been discovered
in the Alps? Could dead sperm save endangered species? Or extinct
ones, such as a mammoth?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning,'' Goto says. He wrote to several
Russian scientists over the next few years, asking about frozen
mammoths. No one wrote back. Then, in 1996, Goto met Kazutoshi
Kobayashi, an entrepreneur adept at doing business in Russia.
Meanwhile, Goto found a scientific partner, Akira Iritani, chairman
of the department of genetic engineering at the prestigious Kinki
University in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Goto told Iritani his vision: Find mammoth sperm with genes
still intact and use it to fertilize a living elephant egg. But
Iritani decided to attempt an even more improbable feat: Clone a
mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even a small bit of mammoth tissue is found with normal
DNA, it would take only a one-time procedure to clone a pure woolly
mammoth,'' Iritani says.
</P>
<P>
   Goto and Iritani decided to travel to Siberia. But in Seoul,
between planes on the way to Yakutsk, a bag packed with $60,000 to
sponsor the dig, disappeared. Arriving empty-handed, Kobayashi
scraped together a few thousand dollars from associates and sent a
team on a trek to Chokurdakh. When the mayor of the tiny settlement
demanded a tax of $70,000, Kobayashi balked, negotiations failed
and they had to look for other places to dig.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on Duvannyi Yar, a renowned mammoth site, but
troubles plagued the researchers as soon as they arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customs officers wanted us to pay arbitrary fines,''
Iritani says. Money changed hands, but their equipment remained
impounded.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally got to Cherskil, the scientists set to work
scouring the cliffs for any sign of mammoth flesh. Using picks to
probe the sediments at the cliff face, the researchers homed in on
spots with mammoth bones or swatches of hair.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, all the expedition had to show for its efforts
was the discovery of an ancient horse skeleton. The weather started
to turn foul, and the Russians pressed to return to Cherskii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating not to come back with tissue,'' Kobayashi
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't given up. This summer they plan to go to
one of several sites where there have been reports of frozen
mammoths. Iritani says his university has spread the word that it
will pay 1 million yen ($9,000) for mammoth tissue preserved well
enough for experiments, a bounty he hopes will entice Russians who
illegally collect mammoth tusks for ivory.
</P>
<P>
   If Goto and his colleagues do find the mammoth of their dreams
this summer, they are prepared to spare no expense. Goto would be
happy with even a single mammoth, for it would fulfill a pledge he
made to children in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, he made a drastic career change, giving up his
position at Kagoshima University to head the Ezu Kindergarten,
which his family owns, in Kumamoto. Goto says he has always wanted
to help shape the minds of children long before they get to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `The mammoth is dead under the ice. Why don't
you leave it in peace?''' Goto says. ``But I promised the kids I
would create a mammoth. I want to do my best to accomplish the
children's dream.''

   Terroir. Tairrrr-wahrrrr. Roll those r's around your mouth as a
Frenchman would. Gargle softly with them; squirt them through your
teeth and from one cheek to the other, as if they were a 1990
Chambertin. Then go walking in late winter through the storied
vineyards of Chainbertin, in Burgundy, where great clods of thawed
mud _ terroir _ will stick to your shoes. Scrape it off with a
limestone shard you've plucked from one of the ancient crumbling
walls. That, too, is terroir.

   Does a vineyard's particular combination of dirt, rock and
exposure to sunlight _ its terroir _ leave an indelible mark on the
wine? People in France say that vineyards just a stone wall apart _
such as Chambertin and its neighbor Chambertin-Clos de Beze _ will
produce wines that taste different even if they are made in exactly
the same way, because the terroir is different.
</P>
<P>
   The notion sounds mystical, even a little snooty to American
ears. But lately science has been backing it up. Although the
notion of terroir has begun to catch on among enologists at some
American wineries, many will cheerfully throw together grapes from
vast estates or entirely separate vineyards even when making
ambitious wines. Those wines may turn out tasty and topnotch _ no
one disputes that great wines are made on both sides of the
Atlantic _ but to a French connoisseur they will lack something
essential, namely the essence of a particular small patch of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every soil brings its own flavor,'' says Damien Gachot, a
young wine maker now tending the ancestral plots in Burgundy.
``That's terroir. And the terroir influence is the most important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a laboratory of the National Institute of Agronomical
Research outside Angers, in the western Loire Valley, a team led by
Christian Asselin and Rene Morlat have recently added scientific
meat to that notion. Their method is simply to do controlled
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago Asselin and Morlat planted a number of test
parcels in their region with cabernet franc, the red varietal grape
that does well there. They took care to plant all the parcels at
the same density. Every year since, they have tended all the fields
and all the vines in exactly the same way, and after harvest they
have followed exactly the same procedures to make the grapes into
wine. Thus the only differences between the wines from different
parcels should be due to the effects of terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting such wines to a panel of experts in blind tastings,
Asselin and Morlat have found that wines from certain parcels are
consistently picked out as having certain characteristics, year
after year. In fact, the terroir differences are of such magnitude
that you don't have to be a trained gargle-and-spit professional to
detect them.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with three 1996 cabernet francs from three parcels
only hundreds of yards apart, your correspondent, in the early
stages of flu and not known for his nose on the best of days, was
knocked back on his heels by a startlingly harsh ``animal note'' in
one of the wines. It happened to be the best one, in the
researchers' opinion, but the point is that the animalism was
absent from that wine's fruitier peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angers researchers have figured out how such differences can
arise from differences in terroir. In their region, at least, the
key variable is soil temperature: some soils warm up sooner than
others in spring and stay warmer throughout the growing season. A
vine with roots in such soil gets a jump start over one on a less
favorable parcel. It's grapes start making sugars and phenols
sooner, and they never lose their lead. The inevitable and perhaps
enviable result is recognizable differences in the wine.
</P>
<P>
   A thin layer of soil on a basement of porous chalk, of the kind
that was used to build the Loire Valley castles, is one of the best
terroirs for cabernet franc, especially when it's on a sunny slope;
a thick layer of clay is one of the worst because it holds a lot of
water and takes a long time to warm.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many possible variations of basement rock and soil
type. As Asselin and Morlat map the terroirs of Anjou (the region
around Angers), they often find dozens of distinct units in a
single village, each capable of producing a distinct wine.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy this news does not surprise anyone. The beginnings
of a controlled terroir experiment have long been in place here:
All the reds worth mentioning are pure pinot noir, by 14th-century
ducal decree, and all the whites are chardonnay. The greatest ones,
the grands crus, are named for, and by law must come exclusively
from, fields that may cover just a few acres.
</P>
<P>
   The fermented essences of these fine plots of land often fetch
upwards of a hundred dollars a bottle when they are obtainable at
all. Wine makers here do not need scientists from upstart Anjou to
explain to them the value of terroir. When Morlat once offered to
apply his methods to the study of some of their prime parcels, the
response of the vintners was layers and layers of ripe red
raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgundians aren't too hot on having a terroir study here like
the one they did at Angers,'' Feuillat says. ``They say, `You're
going to demystify everything. If you start saying a grand cru
means such and such a percentage of clay and limestone, such and
such a slope and nutrition of the vine _ it will lose all its
sacredness.'''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps some of its worldly value as well.

   Terroir. Tairrrr-wahrrrr. Roll those r's around your mouth as a
Frenchman would. Gargle softly with them; squirt them through your
teeth and from one cheek to the other, as if they were a 1990
Chambertin. Then go walking in late winter through the storied
vineyards of Chainbertin, in Burgundy, where great clods of thawed
mud _ terroir _ will stick to your shoes. Scrape it off with a
limestone shard you've plucked from one of the ancient crumbling
walls. That, too, is terroir.

   ``Look, over here! Hair!'' shouts one of the sperm hunters,
pointing to a frayed brown tangle protruding from a cliff along the
Kolyma River in Siberia. When ecologist Sergei Zimov, a big-boned
Russian with a thick blond beard, gets close enough to touch the
hair, he rips a few strands free and rolls them across his fingers,
pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Could this, finally, be the hair of a woolly mammoth, its frozen
body locked inside the crumbling black cliff? Could this be the
first step in a bizarre quest led by Japanese biologists to
inseminate an Asian elephant with woolly mammoth sperm and
selectively breed a fabled prehistoric creature that became extinct
thousands of years ago? ``I know it sounds unbelievable,'' says
Kazufumi Goto, the leader of the project, ``but no science can deny
our idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimov turns the hair in his hands, rubs it between his fingers
and thumb, then poisons the air with his words: ``Steppe bison.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of the woolly mammoth was the Pleistocene Epoch,
stretching from 1.8 million years ago to the end of the last ice
age 11,000 years ago. Mammoths thrived particularly well in
Siberia, where dry grasslands once supported a vibrant ecosystem of
mammoths, bison and other jumbo herbivores. Famished after the end
of the Ice Age by a diet of low-nutrient mosses, and increasingly
harried by human hunters, the big grazers dwindled to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Although most mammoths left behind only their bones, in a few
cases the Siberian permafrost preserved mammoth skin and muscle.
Most of the cells in this tissue had degraded, but in the past
decade scientists managed to rescue a few proteins and fragmented
genes to compare with those in living elephants. And until Goto
began to think otherwise, that was about as close as anyone thought
we'd get to mammoths again.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when Goto began his career at Kagoshima
University in Japan, he applied his nascent understanding of
reproductive biology to his country's pursuit of the ultimate
steak. Goto's task was to use artificial insemination methods to
develop beef with more marbling. Getting sperm from well-marbled
bulls was easy, however, collecting cow eggs wasn't so simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going to the slaughterhouse,'' Goto says. There he
could take ovaries from cows with good marbling.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1986, while peering through a microscope at sperm
swarming an egg, Goto had an epiphany. ``Once a sperm attaches to
the egg's membrane, it stops moving,'' he says. After the two
membranes fuse, the sperm is engulfed by the egg and the tail
breaks off. It dawned on him that the sperm is already dead by the
time it is carried into the egg and delivers its genes.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Goto enlisted a student to perform a series of
experiments using dead sperm. ``We could freeze and thaw 20 times,
and the sperm DNA would never break.'' But when they tried
injecting the dead sperm into mouse eggs, it failed thousands of
times. Goto decided mouse eggs were too fragile and instructed his
student to use bull semen and cow eggs. Success: an egg divided
into an embryo. They subsequently implanted the cluster in a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got pregnant on the first try,'' Goto says.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1992 reproductive biology meeting in Fort Collins, Colo.,
Goto was peppered with questions from a reporter about the
implications of the discovery. Could viable sperm be recovered from
the Ice Man, the 5,000-year-old mummy that had just been discovered
in the Alps? Could dead sperm save endangered species? Or extinct
ones, such as a mammoth?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning,'' Goto says. He wrote to several
Russian scientists over the next few years, asking about frozen
mammoths. No one wrote back. Then, in 1996, Goto met Kazutoshi
Kobayashi, an entrepreneur adept at doing business in Russia.
Meanwhile, Goto found a scientific partner, Akira Iritani, chairman
of the department of genetic engineering at the prestigious Kinki
University in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Goto told Iritani his vision: Find mammoth sperm with genes
still intact and use it to fertilize a living elephant egg. But
Iritani decided to attempt an even more improbable feat: Clone a
mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even a small bit of mammoth tissue is found with normal
DNA, it would take only a one-time procedure to clone a pure woolly
mammoth,'' Iritani says.
</P>
<P>
   Goto and Iritani decided to travel to Siberia. But in Seoul,
between planes on the way to Yakutsk, a bag packed with $60,000 to
sponsor the dig, disappeared. Arriving empty-handed, Kobayashi
scraped together a few thousand dollars from associates and sent a
team on a trek to Chokurdakh. When the mayor of the tiny settlement
demanded a tax of $70,000, Kobayashi balked, negotiations failed
and they had to look for other places to dig.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on Duvannyi Yar, a renowned mammoth site, but
troubles plagued the researchers as soon as they arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customs officers wanted us to pay arbitrary fines,''
Iritani says. Money changed hands, but their equipment remained
impounded.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally got to Cherskil, the scientists set to work
scouring the cliffs for any sign of mammoth flesh. Using picks to
probe the sediments at the cliff face, the researchers homed in on
spots with mammoth bones or swatches of hair.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, all the expedition had to show for its efforts
was the discovery of an ancient horse skeleton. The weather started
to turn foul, and the Russians pressed to return to Cherskii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating not to come back with tissue,'' Kobayashi
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't given up. This summer they plan to go to
one of several sites where there have been reports of frozen
mammoths. Iritani says his university has spread the word that it
will pay 1 million yen ($9,000) for mammoth tissue preserved well
enough for experiments, a bounty he hopes will entice Russians who
illegally collect mammoth tusks for ivory.
</P>
<P>
   If Goto and his colleagues do find the mammoth of their dreams
this summer, they are prepared to spare no expense. Goto would be
happy with even a single mammoth, for it would fulfill a pledge he
made to children in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, he made a drastic career change, giving up his
position at Kagoshima University to head the Ezu Kindergarten,
which his family owns, in Kumamoto. Goto says he has always wanted
to help shape the minds of children long before they get to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `The mammoth is dead under the ice. Why don't
you leave it in peace?''' Goto says. ``But I promised the kids I
would create a mammoth. I want to do my best to accomplish the
children's dream.''

to turn foul, and the Russians pressed to return to Cherskii.

   ``It was frustrating not to come back with tissue,'' Kobayashi
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't given up. This summer they plan to go to
one of several sites where there have been reports of frozen
mammoths. Iritani says his university has spread the word that it
will pay 1 million yen ($9,000) for mammoth tissue preserved well
enough for experiments, a bounty he hopes will entice Russians who
illegally collect mammoth tusks for ivory.
</P>
<P>
   If Goto and his colleagues do find the mammoth of their dreams
this summer, they are prepared to spare no expense. Goto would be
happy with even a single mammoth, for it would fulfill a pledge he
made to children in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, he made a drastic career change, giving up his
position at Kagoshima University to head the Ezu Kindergarten,
which his family owns, in Kumamoto. Goto says he has always wanted
to help shape the minds of children long before they get to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `The mammoth is dead under the ice. Why don't
you leave it in peace?''' Goto says. ``But I promised the kids I
would create a mammoth. I want to do my best to accomplish the
children's dream.''

   Terroir. Tairrrr-wahrrrr. Roll those r's around your mouth as a
Frenchman would. Gargle softly with them; squirt them through your
teeth and from one cheek to the other, as if they were a 1990
Chambertin. Then go walking in late winter through the storied
vineyards of Chainbertin, in Burgundy, where great clods of thawed
mud _ terroir _ will stick to your shoes. Scrape it off with a
limestone shard you've plucked from one of the ancient crumbling
walls. That, too, is terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Does a vineyard's particular combination of dirt, rock and
exposure to sunlight _ its terroir _ leave an indelible mark on the
wine? People in France say that vineyards just a stone wall apart _
such as Chambertin and its neighbor Chambertin-Clos de Beze _ will
produce wines that taste different even if they are made in exactly
the same way, because the terroir is different.
</P>
<P>
   The notion sounds mystical, even a little snooty to American
ears. But lately science has been backing it up. Although the
notion of terroir has begun to catch on among enologists at some
American wineries, many will cheerfully throw together grapes from
vast estates or entirely separate vineyards even when making
ambitious wines. Those wines may turn out tasty and topnotch _ no
one disputes that great wines are made on both sides of the
Atlantic _ but to a French connoisseur they will lack something
essential, namely the essence of a particular small patch of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every soil brings its own flavor,'' says Damien Gachot, a
young wine maker now tending the ancestral plots in Burgundy.
``That's terroir. And the terroir influence is the most important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a laboratory of the National Institute of Agronomical
Research outside Angers, in the western Loire Valley, a team led by
Christian Asselin and Rene Morlat have recently added scientific
meat to that notion. Their method is simply to do controlled
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago Asselin and Morlat planted a number of test
parcels in their region with cabernet franc, the red varietal grape
that does well there. They took care to plant all the parcels at
the same density. Every year since, they have tended all the fields
and all the vines in exactly the same way, and after harvest they
have followed exactly the same procedures to make the grapes into
wine. Thus the only differences between the wines from different
parcels should be due to the effects of terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting such wines to a panel of experts in blind tastings,
Asselin and Morlat have found that wines from certain parcels are
consistently picked out as having certain characteristics, year
after year. In fact, the terroir differences are of such magnitude
that you don't have to be a trained gargle-and-spit professional to
detect them.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with three 1996 cabernet francs from three parcels
only hundreds of yards apart, your correspondent, in the early
stages of flu and not known for his nose on the best of days, was
knocked back on his heels by a startlingly harsh ``animal note'' in
one of the wines. It happened to be the best one, in the
researchers' opinion, but the point is that the animalism was
absent from that wine's fruitier peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angers researchers have figured out how such differences can
arise from differences in terroir. In their region, at least, the
key variable is soil temperature: some soils warm up sooner than
others in spring and stay warmer throughout the growing season. A
vine with roots in such soil gets a jump start over one on a less
favorable parcel. It's grapes start making sugars and phenols
sooner, and they never lose their lead. The inevitable and perhaps
enviable result is recognizable differences in the wine.
</P>
<P>
   A thin layer of soil on a basement of porous chalk, of the kind
that was used to build the Loire Valley castles, is one of the best
terroirs for cabernet franc, especially when it's on a sunny slope;
a thick layer of clay is one of the worst because it holds a lot of
water and takes a long time to warm.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many possible variations of basement rock and soil
type. As Asselin and Morlat map the terroirs of Anjou (the region
around Angers), they often find dozens of distinct units in a
single village, each capable of producing a distinct wine.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy this news does not surprise anyone. The beginnings
of a controlled terroir experiment have long been in place here:
All the reds worth mentioning are pure pinot noir, by 14th-century
ducal decree, and all the whites are chardonnay. The greatest ones,
the grands crus, are named for, and by law must come exclusively
from, fields that may cover just a few acres.
</P>
<P>
   The fermented essences of these fine plots of land often fetch
upwards of a hundred dollars a bottle when they are obtainable at
all. Wine makers here do not need scientists from upstart Anjou to
explain to them the value of terroir. When Morlat once offered to
apply his methods to the study of some of their prime parcels, the
response of the vintners was layers and layers of ripe red
raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgundians aren't too hot on having a terroir study here like
the one they did at Angers,'' Feuillat says. ``They say, `You're
going to demystify everything. If you start saying a grand cru
means such and such a percentage of clay and limestone, such and
such a slope and nutrition of the vine _ it will lose all its
sacredness.'''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps some of its worldly value as well.

   ``Look, over here! Hair!'' shouts one of the sperm hunters,
pointing to a frayed brown tangle protruding from a cliff along the
Kolyma River in Siberia. When ecologist Sergei Zimov, a big-boned
Russian with a thick blond beard, gets close enough to touch the
hair, he rips a few strands free and rolls them across his fingers,
pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Could this, finally, be the hair of a woolly mammoth, its frozen
body locked inside the crumbling black cliff? Could this be the
first step in a bizarre quest led by Japanese biologists to
inseminate an Asian elephant with woolly mammoth sperm and
selectively breed a fabled prehistoric creature that became extinct
thousands of years ago? ``I know it sounds unbelievable,'' says
Kazufumi Goto, the leader of the project, ``but no science can deny
our idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimov turns the hair in his hands, rubs it between his fingers
and thumb, then poisons the air with his words: ``Steppe bison.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of the woolly mammoth was the Pleistocene Epoch,
stretching from 1.8 million years ago to the end of the last ice
age 11,000 years ago. Mammoths thrived particularly well in
Siberia, where dry grasslands once supported a vibrant ecosystem of
mammoths, bison and other jumbo herbivores. Famished after the end
of the Ice Age by a diet of low-nutrient mosses, and increasingly
harried by human hunters, the big grazers dwindled to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Although most mammoths left behind only their bones, in a few
cases the Siberian permafrost preserved mammoth skin and muscle.
Most of the cells in this tissue had degraded, but in the past
decade scientists managed to rescue a few proteins and fragmented
genes to compare with those in living elephants. And until Goto
began to think otherwise, that was about as close as anyone thought
we'd get to mammoths again.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when Goto began his career at Kagoshima
University in Japan, he applied his nascent understanding of
reproductive biology to his country's pursuit of the ultimate
steak. Goto's task was to use artificial insemination methods to
develop beef with more marbling. Getting sperm from well-marbled
bulls was easy, however, collecting cow eggs wasn't so simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going to the slaughterhouse,'' Goto says. There he
could take ovaries from cows with good marbling.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1986, while peering through a microscope at sperm
swarming an egg, Goto had an epiphany. ``Once a sperm attaches to
the egg's membrane, it stops moving,'' he says. After the two
membranes fuse, the sperm is engulfed by the egg and the tail
breaks off. It dawned on him that the sperm is already dead by the
time it is carried into the egg and delivers its genes.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Goto enlisted a student to perform a series of
experiments using dead sperm. ``We could freeze and thaw 20 times,
and the sperm DNA would never break.'' But when they tried
injecting the dead sperm into mouse eggs, it failed thousands of
times. Goto decided mouse eggs were too fragile and instructed his
student to use bull semen and cow eggs. Success: an egg divided
into an embryo. They subsequently implanted the cluster in a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got pregnant on the first try,'' Goto says.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1992 reproductive biology meeting in Fort Collins, Colo.,
Goto was peppered with questions from a reporter about the
implications of the discovery. Could viable sperm be recovered from
the Ice Man, the 5,000-year-old mummy that had just been discovered
in the Alps? Could dead sperm save endangered species? Or extinct
ones, such as a mammoth?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning,'' Goto says. He wrote to several
Russian scientists over the next few years, asking about frozen
mammoths. No one wrote back. Then, in 1996, Goto met Kazutoshi
Kobayashi, an entrepreneur adept at doing business in Russia.
Meanwhile, Goto found a scientific partner, Akira Iritani, chairman
of the department of genetic engineering at the prestigious Kinki
University in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Goto told Iritani his vision: Find mammoth sperm with genes
still intact and use it to fertilize a living elephant egg. But
Iritani decided to attempt an even more improbable feat: Clone a
mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even a small bit of mammoth tissue is found with normal
DNA, it would take only a one-time procedure to clone a pure woolly
mammoth,'' Iritani says.
</P>
<P>
   Goto and Iritani decided to travel to Siberia. But in Seoul,
between planes on the way to Yakutsk, a bag packed with $60,000 to
sponsor the dig, disappeared. Arriving empty-handed, Kobayashi
scraped together a few thousand dollars from associates and sent a
team on a trek to Chokurdakh. When the mayor of the tiny settlement
demanded a tax of $70,000, Kobayashi balked, negotiations failed
and they had to look for other places to dig.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on Duvannyi Yar, a renowned mammoth site, but
troubles plagued the researchers as soon as they arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customs officers wanted us to pay arbitrary fines,''
Iritani says. Money changed hands, but their equipment remained
impounded.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally got to Cherskil, the scientists set to work
scouring the cliffs for any sign of mammoth flesh. Using picks to
probe the sediments at the cliff face, the researchers homed in on
spots with mammoth bones or swatches of hair.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, all the expedition had to show for its efforts
was the discovery of an ancient horse skeleton. The weather started
to turn foul, and the Russians pressed to return to Cherskii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating not to come back with tissue,'' Kobayashi
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't given up. This summer they plan to go to
one of several sites where there have been reports of frozen
mammoths. Iritani says his university has spread the word that it
will pay 1 million yen ($9,000) for mammoth tissue preserved well
enough for experiments, a bounty he hopes will entice Russians who
illegally collect mammoth tusks for ivory.
</P>
<P>
   If Goto and his colleagues do find the mammoth of their dreams
this summer, they are prepared to spare no expense. Goto would be
happy with even a single mammoth, for it would fulfill a pledge he
made to children in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, he made a drastic career change, giving up his
position at Kagoshima University to head the Ezu Kindergarten,
which his family owns, in Kumamoto. Goto says he has always wanted
to help shape the minds of children long before they get to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `The mammoth is dead under the ice. Why don't
you leave it in peace?''' Goto says. ``But I promised the kids I
would create a mammoth. I want to do my best to accomplish the
children's dream.''

cases the Siberian permafrost preserved mammoth skin and muscle.
Most of the cells in this tissue had degraded, but in the past
decade scientists managed to rescue a few proteins and fragmented
genes to compare with those in living elephants. And until Goto
began to think otherwise, that was about as close as anyone thought
we'd get to mammoths again.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when Goto began his career at Kagoshima
University in Japan, he applied his nascent understanding of
reproductive biology to his country's pursuit of the ultimate
steak. Goto's task was to use artificial insemination methods to
develop beef with more marbling. Getting sperm from well-marbled
bulls was easy, however, collecting cow eggs wasn't so simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going to the slaughterhouse,'' Goto says. There he
could take ovaries from cows with good marbling.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1986, while peering through a microscope at sperm
swarming an egg, Goto had an epiphany. ``Once a sperm attaches to
the egg's membrane, it stops moving,'' he says. After the two
membranes fuse, the sperm is engulfed by the egg and the tail
breaks off. It dawned on him that the sperm is already dead by the
time it is carried into the egg and delivers its genes.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Goto enlisted a student to perform a series of
experiments using dead sperm. ``We could freeze and thaw 20 times,
and the sperm DNA would never break.'' But when they tried
injecting the dead sperm into mouse eggs, it failed thousands of
times. Goto decided mouse eggs were too fragile and instructed his
student to use bull semen and cow eggs. Success: an egg divided
into an embryo. They subsequently implanted the cluster in a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got pregnant on the first try,'' Goto says.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1992 reproductive biology meeting in Fort Collins, Colo.,
Goto was peppered with questions from a reporter about the
implications of the discovery. Could viable sperm be recovered from
the Ice Man, the 5,000-year-old mummy that had just been discovered
in the Alps? Could dead sperm save endangered species? Or extinct
ones, such as a mammoth?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning,'' Goto says. He wrote to several
Russian scientists over the next few years, asking about frozen
mammoths. No one wrote back. Then, in 1996, Goto met Kazutoshi
Kobayashi, an entrepreneur adept at doing business in Russia.
Meanwhile, Goto found a scientific partner, Akira Iritani, chairman
of the department of genetic engineering at the prestigious Kinki
University in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Goto told Iritani his vision: Find mammoth sperm with genes
still intact and use it to fertilize a living elephant egg. But
Iritani decided to attempt an even more improbable feat: Clone a
mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even a small bit of mammoth tissue is found with normal
DNA, it would take only a one-time procedure to clone a pure woolly
mammoth,'' Iritani says.
</P>
<P>
   Goto and Iritani decided to travel to Siberia. But in Seoul,
between planes on the way to Yakutsk, a bag packed with $60,000 to
sponsor the dig, disappeared. Arriving empty-handed, Kobayashi
scraped together a few thousand dollars from associates and sent a
team on a trek to Chokurdakh. When the mayor of the tiny settlement
demanded a tax of $70,000, Kobayashi balked, negotiations failed
and they had to look for other places to dig.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on Duvannyi Yar, a renowned mammoth site, but
troubles plagued the researchers as soon as they arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customs officers wanted us to pay arbitrary fines,''
Iritani says. Money changed hands, but their equipment remained
impounded.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally got to Cherskil, the scientists set to work
scouring the cliffs for any sign of mammoth flesh. Using picks to
probe the sediments at the cliff face, the researchers homed in on
spots with mammoth bones or swatches of hair.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, all the expedition had to show for its efforts
was the discovery of an ancient horse skeleton. The weather started
to turn foul, and the Russians pressed to return to Cherskii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating not to come back with tissue,'' Kobayashi
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't given up. This summer they plan to go to
one of several sites where there have been reports of frozen
mammoths. Iritani says his university has spread the word that it
will pay 1 million yen ($9,000) for mammoth tissue preserved well
enough for experiments, a bounty he hopes will entice Russians who
illegally collect mammoth tusks for ivory.
</P>
<P>
   If Goto and his colleagues do find the mammoth of their dreams
this summer, they are prepared to spare no expense. Goto would be
happy with even a single mammoth, for it would fulfill a pledge he
made to children in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, he made a drastic career change, giving up his
position at Kagoshima University to head the Ezu Kindergarten,
which his family owns, in Kumamoto. Goto says he has always wanted
to help shape the minds of children long before they get to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `The mammoth is dead under the ice. Why don't
you leave it in peace?''' Goto says. ``But I promised the kids I
would create a mammoth. I want to do my best to accomplish the
children's dream.''

RIGHTS VIOLATORS EXPLOIT US IMMIGRATION SYSTEM

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the years following World War II, US immigration officials
made a shocking discovery. Among the waves of refugees fleeing the
Holocaust were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of former Nazis who
managed to slip into the United States by posing as victims of
their own crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon became something of a national scandal, and in
1979 the Justice Department set up an Office of Special
Investigations. Armed with attorneys and multilingual historians
who pored over the Nazis' voluminous archives, the unit has
stripped 61 former perpetrators of their citizenship, deported 48,
and compiled a ``watch list'' of some 60,000 suspected war
criminals for possible exclusion from the United States
</P>
<P>
   ``I am now the world's longest-serving prosecutor of World War
II cases,'' said Eli M. Rosenbaum, who directs the $3.7 million
program.
</P>
<P>
   The success of OSI, now often viewed as the world's most
effective Nazi-fighting organization, has been held up by human
rights activists as an example of what the US government can do to
address the growing problem of modern war criminals who also have
quietly sought refuge in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to keep out people who commit human rights crimes _
then track them down once they slip through _ remain inadequate,
critics said. Lacking a coherent strategy, the government is
hamstrung by archaic laws that can bar members of the Communist
Party from entering the country but also prevent the deportation of
people accused of atrocities. Immigration officials lack resources
to track suspected offenders, or investigate their crimes once they
are discovered. The Immigration and Naturalization Service
acknowledges that it has no idea how many human rights offenders
might be in the United States, nor has it bothered to keep track of
how many such people it has deported.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the same process that allowed the Nazis to enter
the country following World War II is being repeated, critics said.
Although the magnitude of the problem is unclear, human rights
criminals from other global hot spots are exploiting weaknesses in
the government's refugee program, which admits tens of thousands of
persecuted people each year. In addition, government agencies
sometimes seem to act out of competing political interests, such as
when US officials granted visas to Haitian military leaders in
1994, even after US troops had removed them from power.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is a vastly complicated one for the United States,
which for decades has offered a safe haven to millions of
persecuted people around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American government is trying to open their arms, but at
the same time close their eyes to what is happening,'' said Ahmed
Samater, who has helped immigration officials document former
members of Somali strongman Mohammed Siad Barre's murderous regime
who have settled in the United States and Canada. ``Nobody wants to
have a neighbor who's a torturer or a killer.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Yusuf Abdi Ali, a former Somali colonel accused of
overseeing the slaughter of thousands of his countrymen in the
1980s, appears to demonstrate the weaknesses in the system. Ali,
who is known as ``Tuke,'' or The Crow, was deported from Canada in
1992 after a television program exposed him as a war criminal. He
then lived comfortably in the United States until 1996, when CBS
exposed him again and he returned to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long. Immigration officials said Tuke reentered the
country under an assumed name, then became a permanent resident of
the United States by marrying an American citizen. After being
tipped off by outraged Somali immigrants, the INS finally arrested
him in Virginia last year and moved to have him deported, accusing
him of concealing his involvement in ``genocidal acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Under immigration law, the INS needed the State Department to
issue a finding that genocide, not just atrocities, had occurred
under Tuke's command. The State Department refused to go that far,
so the INS attempted to deport him on grounds he had lied on an
application he had submitted for political asylum. An immigration
judge dismissed the case because Tuke had withdrawn the application
after becoming a permanent resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say he's a nice guy; we all know what he is,''
said an INS official. ``But that's not enough for us. We have to
act under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Despots take advantage
</P>
<P>
   of gaps in refugee program
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Samater said the case illustrates not only the porousness of the
US refugee program but also the inability of the immigration system
to handle such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody even addressing the central theme: that he
committed crimes against humanity,'' Samater said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration specialists said the refugee program has become
especially vulnerable to despots seeking asylum. The program is a
lifeline for tens of thousands of people who each year are
legitimately escaping persecution. The most recent example is the
exodus of hundreds of thousands of people driven from Kosovo by the
Serbian army. The United States plans to take in 20,000 refugees
from the crisis, US immigration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the screening of refugee applicants has become almost
perfunctory, according to people who administer the massive
program. The screening often takes place amid the chaos of armed
conflict, in ``places that have descended into hell,'' said Dan
Cadman, who heads the National Security Unit for the INS. Those
conditions make it difficult to verify persecution claims or to
identify specific perpetrators of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government relies on ``joint voluntary
agencies'' to perform most screening tasks. Contracted by the State
Department, the relief agencies are responsible for compiling
information to evaluate persecution claims before passing along the
files to INS officers. But the agencies are essentially refugee
advocates, lacking resources to investigate and seldom making
recommendations to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of in a delicate position; we have to be lenient,''
said Gary Remmel, head of processing in Belgrade for the
International Organization for Migration, which screened two
Bosnian refugees who were admitted into the United States, even
though the Globe later identified them as participants in ethnic
cleansing. ``We don't have the authority to be too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Remmel said many applications passed on to the INS are difficult
to support. People who advocate for refugees ``sometimes don't
realize the amount of weak claims you see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Remmel said he was unfamiliar with the two cases investigated by
the Globe. However, with few safeguards and a crush of
applications, he said: ``It's no surprise that people get in who
shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   INS officers are responsible for investigating the background of
applicants, but people involved in the process said the refugee
program has become so large it is difficult to do more than a basic
40-minute interview, particularly during a crisis. During the war
in Bosnia, each INS officer conducted roughly a dozen such
interviews a day, according to Karen McCoy, an INS officer who was
part of the program.

   Terroir. Tairrrr-wahrrrr. Roll those r's around your mouth as a
Frenchman would. Gargle softly with them; squirt them through your
teeth and from one cheek to the other, as if they were a 1990
Chambertin. Then go walking in late winter through the storied
vineyards of Chainbertin, in Burgundy, where great clods of thawed
mud _ terroir _ will stick to your shoes. Scrape it off with a
limestone shard you've plucked from one of the ancient crumbling
walls. That, too, is terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Does a vineyard's particular combination of dirt, rock and
exposure to sunlight _ its terroir _ leave an indelible mark on the
wine? People in France say that vineyards just a stone wall apart _
such as Chambertin and its neighbor Chambertin-Clos de Beze _ will
produce wines that taste different even if they are made in exactly
the same way, because the terroir is different.
</P>
<P>
   The notion sounds mystical, even a little snooty to American
ears. But lately science has been backing it up. Although the
notion of terroir has begun to catch on among enologists at some
American wineries, many will cheerfully throw together grapes from
vast estates or entirely separate vineyards even when making
ambitious wines. Those wines may turn out tasty and topnotch _ no
one disputes that great wines are made on both sides of the
Atlantic _ but to a French connoisseur they will lack something
essential, namely the essence of a particular small patch of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every soil brings its own flavor,'' says Damien Gachot, a
young wine maker now tending the ancestral plots in Burgundy.
``That's terroir. And the terroir influence is the most important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a laboratory of the National Institute of Agronomical
Research outside Angers, in the western Loire Valley, a team led by
Christian Asselin and Rene Morlat have recently added scientific
meat to that notion. Their method is simply to do controlled
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago Asselin and Morlat planted a number of test
parcels in their region with cabernet franc, the red varietal grape
that does well there. They took care to plant all the parcels at
the same density. Every year since, they have tended all the fields
and all the vines in exactly the same way, and after harvest they
have followed exactly the same procedures to make the grapes into
wine. Thus the only differences between the wines from different
parcels should be due to the effects of terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting such wines to a panel of experts in blind tastings,
Asselin and Morlat have found that wines from certain parcels are
consistently picked out as having certain characteristics, year
after year. In fact, the terroir differences are of such magnitude
that you don't have to be a trained gargle-and-spit professional to
detect them.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with three 1996 cabernet francs from three parcels
only hundreds of yards apart, your correspondent, in the early
stages of flu and not known for his nose on the best of days, was
knocked back on his heels by a startlingly harsh ``animal note'' in
one of the wines. It happened to be the best one, in the
researchers' opinion, but the point is that the animalism was
absent from that wine's fruitier peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angers researchers have figured out how such differences can
arise from differences in terroir. In their region, at least, the
key variable is soil temperature: some soils warm up sooner than
others in spring and stay warmer throughout the growing season. A
vine with roots in such soil gets a jump start over one on a less
favorable parcel. It's grapes start making sugars and phenols
sooner, and they never lose their lead. The inevitable and perhaps
enviable result is recognizable differences in the wine.
</P>
<P>
   A thin layer of soil on a basement of porous chalk, of the kind
that was used to build the Loire Valley castles, is one of the best
terroirs for cabernet franc, especially when it's on a sunny slope;
a thick layer of clay is one of the worst because it holds a lot of
water and takes a long time to warm.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many possible variations of basement rock and soil
type. As Asselin and Morlat map the terroirs of Anjou (the region
around Angers), they often find dozens of distinct units in a
single village, each capable of producing a distinct wine.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy this news does not surprise anyone. The beginnings
of a controlled terroir experiment have long been in place here:
All the reds worth mentioning are pure pinot noir, by 14th-century
ducal decree, and all the whites are chardonnay. The greatest ones,
the grands crus, are named for, and by law must come exclusively
from, fields that may cover just a few acres.
</P>
<P>
   The fermented essences of these fine plots of land often fetch
upwards of a hundred dollars a bottle when they are obtainable at
all. Wine makers here do not need scientists from upstart Anjou to
explain to them the value of terroir. When Morlat once offered to
apply his methods to the study of some of their prime parcels, the
response of the vintners was layers and layers of ripe red
raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgundians aren't too hot on having a terroir study here like
the one they did at Angers,'' Feuillat says. ``They say, `You're
going to demystify everything. If you start saying a grand cru
means such and such a percentage of clay and limestone, such and
such a slope and nutrition of the vine _ it will lose all its
sacredness.'''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps some of its worldly value as well.

   ``Look, over here! Hair!'' shouts one of the sperm hunters,
pointing to a frayed brown tangle protruding from a cliff along the
Kolyma River in Siberia. When ecologist Sergei Zimov, a big-boned
Russian with a thick blond beard, gets close enough to touch the
hair, he rips a few strands free and rolls them across his fingers,
pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Could this, finally, be the hair of a woolly mammoth, its frozen
body locked inside the crumbling black cliff? Could this be the
first step in a bizarre quest led by Japanese biologists to
inseminate an Asian elephant with woolly mammoth sperm and
selectively breed a fabled prehistoric creature that became extinct
thousands of years ago? ``I know it sounds unbelievable,'' says
Kazufumi Goto, the leader of the project, ``but no science can deny
our idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimov turns the hair in his hands, rubs it between his fingers
and thumb, then poisons the air with his words: ``Steppe bison.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of the woolly mammoth was the Pleistocene Epoch,
stretching from 1.8 million years ago to the end of the last ice
age 11,000 years ago. Mammoths thrived particularly well in
Siberia, where dry grasslands once supported a vibrant ecosystem of
mammoths, bison and other jumbo herbivores. Famished after the end
of the Ice Age by a diet of low-nutrient mosses, and increasingly
harried by human hunters, the big grazers dwindled to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Although most mammoths left behind only their bones, in a few
cases the Siberian permafrost preserved mammoth skin and muscle.
Most of the cells in this tissue had degraded, but in the past
decade scientists managed to rescue a few proteins and fragmented
genes to compare with those in living elephants. And until Goto
began to think otherwise, that was about as close as anyone thought
we'd get to mammoths again.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when Goto began his career at Kagoshima
University in Japan, he applied his nascent understanding of
reproductive biology to his country's pursuit of the ultimate
steak. Goto's task was to use artificial insemination methods to
develop beef with more marbling. Getting sperm from well-marbled
bulls was easy, however, collecting cow eggs wasn't so simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going to the slaughterhouse,'' Goto says. There he
could take ovaries from cows with good marbling.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1986, while peering through a microscope at sperm
swarming an egg, Goto had an epiphany. ``Once a sperm attaches to
the egg's membrane, it stops moving,'' he says. After the two
membranes fuse, the sperm is engulfed by the egg and the tail
breaks off. It dawned on him that the sperm is already dead by the
time it is carried into the egg and delivers its genes.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Goto enlisted a student to perform a series of
experiments using dead sperm. ``We could freeze and thaw 20 times,
and the sperm DNA would never break.'' But when they tried
injecting the dead sperm into mouse eggs, it failed thousands of
times. Goto decided mouse eggs were too fragile and instructed his
student to use bull semen and cow eggs. Success: an egg divided
into an embryo. They subsequently implanted the cluster in a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got pregnant on the first try,'' Goto says.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1992 reproductive biology meeting in Fort Collins, Colo.,
Goto was peppered with questions from a reporter about the
implications of the discovery. Could viable sperm be recovered from
the Ice Man, the 5,000-year-old mummy that had just been discovered
in the Alps? Could dead sperm save endangered species? Or extinct
ones, such as a mammoth?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning,'' Goto says. He wrote to several
Russian scientists over the next few years, asking about frozen
mammoths. No one wrote back. Then, in 1996, Goto met Kazutoshi
Kobayashi, an entrepreneur adept at doing business in Russia.
Meanwhile, Goto found a scientific partner, Akira Iritani, chairman
of the department of genetic engineering at the prestigious Kinki
University in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Goto told Iritani his vision: Find mammoth sperm with genes
still intact and use it to fertilize a living elephant egg. But
Iritani decided to attempt an even more improbable feat: Clone a
mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even a small bit of mammoth tissue is found with normal
DNA, it would take only a one-time procedure to clone a pure woolly
mammoth,'' Iritani says.
</P>
<P>
   Goto and Iritani decided to travel to Siberia. But in Seoul,
between planes on the way to Yakutsk, a bag packed with $60,000 to
sponsor the dig, disappeared. Arriving empty-handed, Kobayashi
scraped together a few thousand dollars from associates and sent a
team on a trek to Chokurdakh. When the mayor of the tiny settlement
demanded a tax of $70,000, Kobayashi balked, negotiations failed
and they had to look for other places to dig.
</P>
<P>
   They settled on Duvannyi Yar, a renowned mammoth site, but
troubles plagued the researchers as soon as they arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customs officers wanted us to pay arbitrary fines,''
Iritani says. Money changed hands, but their equipment remained
impounded.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally got to Cherskil, the scientists set to work
scouring the cliffs for any sign of mammoth flesh. Using picks to
probe the sediments at the cliff face, the researchers homed in on
spots with mammoth bones or swatches of hair.
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, all the expedition had to show for its efforts
was the discovery of an ancient horse skeleton. The weather started
to turn foul, and the Russians pressed to return to Cherskii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating not to come back with tissue,'' Kobayashi
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese haven't given up. This summer they plan to go to
one of several sites where there have been reports of frozen
mammoths. Iritani says his university has spread the word that it
will pay 1 million yen ($9,000) for mammoth tissue preserved well
enough for experiments, a bounty he hopes will entice Russians who
illegally collect mammoth tusks for ivory.
</P>
<P>
   If Goto and his colleagues do find the mammoth of their dreams
this summer, they are prepared to spare no expense. Goto would be
happy with even a single mammoth, for it would fulfill a pledge he
made to children in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, he made a drastic career change, giving up his
position at Kagoshima University to head the Ezu Kindergarten,
which his family owns, in Kumamoto. Goto says he has always wanted
to help shape the minds of children long before they get to a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `The mammoth is dead under the ice. Why don't
you leave it in peace?''' Goto says. ``But I promised the kids I
would create a mammoth. I want to do my best to accomplish the
children's dream.''

   A broad range of individuals have gained refuge in the United
States despite evidence of their involvement in human rights abuses
elsewhere in the world. They include alleged participants of
``ethnic cleansing'' in the former Yugoslavia, former henchmen of
the murderous regime of Somali strongman Mohammed Siad Barre, and
Haitian military officers and Salvadoran generals accused of
covering up the massacre of four American churchwomen. The Boston
Globe, in a three-part series, explores the development.

   Terroir. Tairrrr-wahrrrr. Roll those r's around your mouth as a
Frenchman would. Gargle softly with them; squirt them through your
teeth and from one cheek to the other, as if they were a 1990
Chambertin. Then go walking in late winter through the storied
vineyards of Chainbertin, in Burgundy, where great clods of thawed
mud _ terroir _ will stick to your shoes. Scrape it off with a
limestone shard you've plucked from one of the ancient crumbling
walls. That, too, is terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Does a vineyard's particular combination of dirt, rock and
exposure to sunlight _ its terroir _ leave an indelible mark on the
wine? People in France say that vineyards just a stone wall apart _
such as Chambertin and its neighbor Chambertin-Clos de Beze _ will
produce wines that taste different even if they are made in exactly
the same way, because the terroir is different.
</P>
<P>
   The notion sounds mystical, even a little snooty to American
ears. But lately science has been backing it up. Although the
notion of terroir has begun to catch on among enologists at some
American wineries, many will cheerfully throw together grapes from
vast estates or entirely separate vineyards even when making
ambitious wines. Those wines may turn out tasty and topnotch _ no
one disputes that great wines are made on both sides of the
Atlantic _ but to a French connoisseur they will lack something
essential, namely the essence of a particular small patch of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every soil brings its own flavor,'' says Damien Gachot, a
young wine maker now tending the ancestral plots in Burgundy.
``That's terroir. And the terroir influence is the most important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a laboratory of the National Institute of Agronomical
Research outside Angers, in the western Loire Valley, a team led by
Christian Asselin and Rene Morlat have recently added scientific
meat to that notion. Their method is simply to do controlled
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago Asselin and Morlat planted a number of test
parcels in their region with cabernet franc, the red varietal grape
that does well there. They took care to plant all the parcels at
the same density. Every year since, they have tended all the fields
and all the vines in exactly the same way, and after harvest they
have followed exactly the same procedures to make the grapes into
wine. Thus the only differences between the wines from different
parcels should be due to the effects of terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting such wines to a panel of experts in blind tastings,
Asselin and Morlat have found that wines from certain parcels are
consistently picked out as having certain characteristics, year
after year. In fact, the terroir differences are of such magnitude
that you don't have to be a trained gargle-and-spit professional to
detect them.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with three 1996 cabernet francs from three parcels
only hundreds of yards apart, your correspondent, in the early
stages of flu and not known for his nose on the best of days, was
knocked back on his heels by a startlingly harsh ``animal note'' in
one of the wines. It happened to be the best one, in the
researchers' opinion, but the point is that the animalism was
absent from that wine's fruitier peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angers researchers have figured out how such differences can
arise from differences in terroir. In their region, at least, the
key variable is soil temperature: some soils warm up sooner than
others in spring and stay warmer throughout the growing season. A
vine with roots in such soil gets a jump start over one on a less
favorable parcel. It's grapes start making sugars and phenols
sooner, and they never lose their lead. The inevitable and perhaps
enviable result is recognizable differences in the wine.
</P>
<P>
   A thin layer of soil on a basement of porous chalk, of the kind
that was used to build the Loire Valley castles, is one of the best
terroirs for cabernet franc, especially when it's on a sunny slope;
a thick layer of clay is one of the worst because it holds a lot of
water and takes a long time to warm.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many possible variations of basement rock and soil
type. As Asselin and Morlat map the terroirs of Anjou (the region
around Angers), they often find dozens of distinct units in a
single village, each capable of producing a distinct wine.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy this news does not surprise anyone. The beginnings
of a controlled terroir experiment have long been in place here:
All the reds worth mentioning are pure pinot noir, by 14th-century
ducal decree, and all the whites are chardonnay. The greatest ones,
the grands crus, are named for, and by law must come exclusively
from, fields that may cover just a few acres.
</P>
<P>
   The fermented essences of these fine plots of land often fetch
upwards of a hundred dollars a bottle when they are obtainable at
all. Wine makers here do not need scientists from upstart Anjou to
explain to them the value of terroir. When Morlat once offered to
apply his methods to the study of some of their prime parcels, the
response of the vintners was layers and layers of ripe red
raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgundians aren't too hot on having a terroir study here like
the one they did at Angers,'' Feuillat says. ``They say, `You're
going to demystify everything. If you start saying a grand cru
means such and such a percentage of clay and limestone, such and
such a slope and nutrition of the vine _ it will lose all its
sacredness.'''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps some of its worldly value as well.

   Terroir. Tairrrr-wahrrrr. Roll those r's around your mouth as a
Frenchman would. Gargle softly with them; squirt them through your
teeth and from one cheek to the other, as if they were a 1990
Chambertin. Then go walking in late winter through the storied
vineyards of Chainbertin, in Burgundy, where great clods of thawed
mud _ terroir _ will stick to your shoes. Scrape it off with a
limestone shard you've plucked from one of the ancient crumbling
walls. That, too, is terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Does a vineyard's particular combination of dirt, rock and
exposure to sunlight _ its terroir _ leave an indelible mark on the
wine? People in France say that vineyards just a stone wall apart _
such as Chambertin and its neighbor Chambertin-Clos de Beze _ will
produce wines that taste different even if they are made in exactly
the same way, because the terroir is different.
</P>
<P>
   The notion sounds mystical, even a little snooty to American
ears. But lately science has been backing it up. Although the
notion of terroir has begun to catch on among enologists at some
American wineries, many will cheerfully throw together grapes from
vast estates or entirely separate vineyards even when making
ambitious wines. Those wines may turn out tasty and topnotch _ no
one disputes that great wines are made on both sides of the
Atlantic _ but to a French connoisseur they will lack something
essential, namely the essence of a particular small patch of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every soil brings its own flavor,'' says Damien Gachot, a
young wine maker now tending the ancestral plots in Burgundy.
``That's terroir. And the terroir influence is the most important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a laboratory of the National Institute of Agronomical
Research outside Angers, in the western Loire Valley, a team led by
Christian Asselin and Rene Morlat have recently added scientific
meat to that notion. Their method is simply to do controlled
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago Asselin and Morlat planted a number of test
parcels in their region with cabernet franc, the red varietal grape
that does well there. They took care to plant all the parcels at
the same density. Every year since, they have tended all the fields
and all the vines in exactly the same way, and after harvest they
have followed exactly the same procedures to make the grapes into
wine. Thus the only differences between the wines from different
parcels should be due to the effects of terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting such wines to a panel of experts in blind tastings,
Asselin and Morlat have found that wines from certain parcels are
consistently picked out as having certain characteristics, year
after year. In fact, the terroir differences are of such magnitude
that you don't have to be a trained gargle-and-spit professional to
detect them.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with three 1996 cabernet francs from three parcels
only hundreds of yards apart, your correspondent, in the early
stages of flu and not known for his nose on the best of days, was
knocked back on his heels by a startlingly harsh ``animal note'' in
one of the wines. It happened to be the best one, in the
researchers' opinion, but the point is that the animalism was
absent from that wine's fruitier peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angers researchers have figured out how such differences can
arise from differences in terroir. In their region, at least, the
key variable is soil temperature: some soils warm up sooner than
others in spring and stay warmer throughout the growing season. A
vine with roots in such soil gets a jump start over one on a less
favorable parcel. It's grapes start making sugars and phenols
sooner, and they never lose their lead. The inevitable and perhaps
enviable result is recognizable differences in the wine.
</P>
<P>
   A thin layer of soil on a basement of porous chalk, of the kind
that was used to build the Loire Valley castles, is one of the best
terroirs for cabernet franc, especially when it's on a sunny slope;
a thick layer of clay is one of the worst because it holds a lot of
water and takes a long time to warm.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many possible variations of basement rock and soil
type. As Asselin and Morlat map the terroirs of Anjou (the region
around Angers), they often find dozens of distinct units in a
single village, each capable of producing a distinct wine.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy this news does not surprise anyone. The beginnings
of a controlled terroir experiment have long been in place here:
All the reds worth mentioning are pure pinot noir, by 14th-century
ducal decree, and all the whites are chardonnay. The greatest ones,
the grands crus, are named for, and by law must come exclusively
from, fields that may cover just a few acres.
</P>
<P>
   The fermented essences of these fine plots of land often fetch
upwards of a hundred dollars a bottle when they are obtainable at
all. Wine makers here do not need scientists from upstart Anjou to
explain to them the value of terroir. When Morlat once offered to
apply his methods to the study of some of their prime parcels, the
response of the vintners was layers and layers of ripe red
raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgundians aren't too hot on having a terroir study here like
the one they did at Angers,'' Feuillat says. ``They say, `You're
going to demystify everything. If you start saying a grand cru
means such and such a percentage of clay and limestone, such and
such a slope and nutrition of the vine _ it will lose all its
sacredness.'''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps some of its worldly value as well.

   ``We are all here,'' said Dorelien. ``Plus, other members of the
staff at different periods of time during those three years.
Remember, all members didn't stay in the same position between
1991-94. Sometimes Cedras would change his staff. Those former
members, they are here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien said most of the former officers reside in Florida and
New York, and despite the fact that they have gained refuge,
continue to seethe over the Clinton administration's policy toward
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are watching TV and President Clinton says something
about Haiti, we smile, because he knows that he's lying, and we
know that he's lying,'' said Dorelien. ``But we don't say anything,
because we have to be careful. They accepted us here, so we have to
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   --The US government also has failed to address other
high-profile cases in which alleged perpetrators of crimes have
been allowed to reside in the United States despite protests from
victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while investigating the massacre of the churchwomen
in El Salvador, representatives of the Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights in New York discovered that Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, a
retired Salvadoran general, had been living in Florida, even though
he had been implicated in a widespread coverup of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most heinous crimes of El Salvador's 13-year civil
war, the women _ three nuns and a layworker _ were kidnapped by
members of the Salvadoran national guard, taken to a remote
location, raped, then shot to death. The case was solved only after
US authorities circumvented a widespread coverup by the Salvadoran
military and developed independent evidence against the national
guardsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Vides headed the National Guard at the time of the murders. He
appointed an internal investigator who helped the gunmen change
their weapons and personally ordered them not to confess to anyone,
according to testimony from the gunmen. In 1993, a United Nations
Truth Commission, supported and partially funded by the US
government, concluded that Vides ``knew that members of the
National Guard had committed the assassination and. . .had
facilitated the concealment of facts, obstructing the respective
judicial investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview recently at his spacious home in Palm Coast,
near Daytona Beach, Vides, 61, adamantly denied his involvement in
the coverup and said he had entered the United States by applying
for a visa through normal channels within the US consulate in San
Salvador. ``I ask myself over and over if there is anything I have
done wrong, and I can't find anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, the brother of one of the nuns, said he was sickened to
learn last year from the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights that
Vides and retired General Jose Guillermo Garcia, the Salvadoran
defense minister at the time of the murders, were both living in
Florida. ``It's just pulling a scab off a very deep wound,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said he asked the Justice Department why Vides had been
allowed to enter the country. ``The explanation is, `We're looking
into this and we'll tell you promptly.' That was in November,'' he
said. ``We have yet to hear any substantive explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Bergeron, an INS spokesman, said he could not talk about
Vides' case because of privacy restrictions. But he said the Truth
Commission's allegations about Vides' involvement in the coverup
emerged after he already had been admitted into the United States
through ``normal immigration procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, similar outrage greeted the news that Emmanuel
``Toto'' Constant, who once headed the Haitian death squad FRAPH,
has been living with his aunt in a two-story home in Queens. The
paramilitary unit headed by Constant was believed to be responsible
for some of the most gruesome crimes of the Haitian regime.
</P>
<P>
   Constant entered the country through Puerto Rico on a
multiple-entry visa often issued to officials of foreign
governments, INS officials said. In 1995, then-Secretary of State
Warren Christopher ordered that Constant's visa be revoked, noting
in a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno that Constant's
``presence and activities in the United States seriously undermine.
. .compelling foreign policy objectives'' and gives the impression
``that the United States is permitting Mr. Constant to use the
United States as a base of operation for FRAPH.''
</P>
<P>
   An immigration judge issued a deportation order against
Constant, but the State Department later balked, saying that his
presence in Haiti could destabilize the government. The INS, which
had taken Constant into custody, released him after determining
that he did not present a threat to public safety in the United
States. In a highly unusual resolution last year, the New York City
Council called the government's refusal to extradite Constant
``unconscionable'' and said his presence ``can have dire
consequences for the City of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to contact Constant were unsuccessful, but sources in
the Haitian community said he recently tried to enhance his image
by offering $7,000 to a prestigious Masonic order in Brooklyn in an
unsuccessful effort to gain membership.
</P>
<P>
   Dorelian's story appears to offer the first evidence that US
military officials issued visas to Haitian military leaders, even
as US troops were expelling them from power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dorelien, he requested his visa on Oct. 26, 1994,
just before Aristide, who had been restored to power by US troops,
sent him into exile in Spain. He said he told the US military
attache, Lieutenant Colonel Steven Lovasz, that he didn't want to
leave Haiti without a US visa. He said Lovasz took his passport,
then returned to Dorelien's home later that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knocked on my door and he said, `Colonel, I don't come to
see you. Where is your wife, Mrs. Dorelien?' '' Dorelien recalled.
``I called her, and we had a glass of wine together while my wife
got dressed. She came down and (Lovasz) stood up and said, `Mrs.
Dorelien, during these three years, your husband gave us all kinds
of trouble. But he is one of the Haitian officers that the US
officers respect, because he always told the truth. And that's why
we decided to give him a US visa for five years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to his family, Lovasz has retired from the military
and is working in security operations on a project for the Exxon
Corp. in Cameroon. Attempts to reach him were unsuccessful.
Bergeron said the INS could not comment on Dorelien's case because
of privacy restrictions.

</P>
<P>
   Before the coup to overthrow Aristide in 1991, Dorelien had
commanded a base where the Haitian army kept most of its tanks,
sources in Haiti said. He was regarded as instrumental to the
success of the coup, and was rewarded with a position as assistant
chief of staff to Philippe Biamby, heading all personnel decisions
for the Haitian army.
</P>
<P>
   As Dorelien describes it, his $3.2 million lottery jackpot was
actually a step down. In Haiti, he said he didn't quite live in a
house. ``My house in Haiti is a palace,'' he exclaimed, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien justified the coup by suggesting that Haitians, who
elected Aristide overwhelmingly, were not educated enough to elect
a president. ``If someone doesn't know how to read, or to choose,
how can you talk about democracy?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to numerous human rights reports, he denied that the
Haitian military slaughtered its perceived opponents. He claimed
that US officials had paid people to steal corpses from local
morgues, then lay the bodies in the street and shot them to make it
appear that they had been murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien recalled participating in the dramatic eleventh-hour
negotiations with former President Carter, retired General Colin
Powell, and former Senator Sam Nunn that finally led the junta to
step down. At one point, he said he hesitated to shake hands with
Carter because he did not want to touch a hand that had come in
contact with Aristide, whom he described as ``the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `President Carter, before coming here, did you shake
hands with Aristide?' '' Dorelien recalled. ``I was surprised when
he said, `No, why?' I said, `If you shook hands with him, his bad
spirit would still be on you, and you could never (get it off).' I
don't know what you believe, but that is what we call Haitian
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien acknowledged that many bad things had been said about
the Haitian military, but he said that he was neither corrupt nor
violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I am clean,'' he said. ``If I wasn't clean, I
wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have the respect that I have from
people from the Pentagon, from people of the State Department.''

   A broad range of individuals have gained refuge in the United
States despite evidence of their involvement in human rights abuses
elsewhere in the world. They include alleged participants of
``ethnic cleansing'' in the former Yugoslavia, former henchmen of
the murderous regime of Somali strongman Mohammed Siad Barre, and
Haitian military officers and Salvadoran generals accused of
covering up the massacre of four American churchwomen. The Boston
Globe, in a three-part series, explores the development.

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Carl Dorelien was once a small-time
dictator, and a proud one at that. He was part of a clique of
military officers who held Haiti at gunpoint until 1994, when the
junta's abuses became so grave that the Clinton administration
dispatched 20,000 troops to the tiny Caribbean nation to restore
order.
</P>
<P>
   An outspoken colonel, Dorelien had been head of personnel for
the Haitian army, which had seized power from President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. He oversaw a 7,000-man force whose
well-documented campaign of butchery included murder, rape,
kidnapping, and torture, leading to the deaths of some 5,000
Haitian civilians over three bloody years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good agreement for the United States and for
Haiti,'' President Clinton told Americans after the junta stepped
aside. ``The military leaders will leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien left, but where he went is another story. He is living
with his family in this Florida resort community, on a visa granted
him by the same government that launched a full-scale invasion and
spent $2.2 billion to remove him and his fellow officers from
power. His past has remained largely hidden, even after he made
local news in 1997 by winning a $3.2 million jackpot in the Florida
lottery. Lottery officials described him as a penniless immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview here, Dorelian spoke candidly about
his past. ``I was a member of the Haitian army high command,'' he
said, a miniature $2,500 gold bar dangling from his neck. ``I lived
like a king in my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien's case is not an isolated one. A Globe investigation
has discovered a broad range of people who have gained refuge in
the United States over the last several years despite evidence of
their involvement in serious human rights abuses. The list includes
three alleged participants of ethnic cleansing in the former
Yugoslavia, two who are living in New England; several former
henchmen of the murderous regime of Somali strongman Mohammed Siad
Barre; 15 Haitian military officers who Dorelien said joined him in
America; and a Salvadoran general accused of covering up the
massacre of four American churchwomen in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dorelien, who said he received a five-year visa from a
friendly US military officer, some entered the country with the
knowledge _ and even the assistance _ of US government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really appalling to think that the United States has
become the retirement home of choice for murderers and despots,''
said William P. Ford, a New York attorney whose sister Ita, a nun,
was killed by members of the Salvadoran National Guard in the 1980
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Cadman, chief of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's national security unit, said the agency has become
increasingly concerned about human rights offenders who have taken
refuge in the United States. Although the magnitude of the problem
is unclear, he said, it is the logical outgrowth of numerous recent
international conflicts, the historic practice of the United States
to take in persecution victims, and the difficulties of screening
the 6.5 million people issued visas to enter the country each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want, in an ideal society, even one monster in your
midst,'' said Cadman. ``The concern is deep, but that doesn't
necessarily suggest there is a widespread problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights monitors compare the problem to that of
hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of Nazis who slipped into the
United States following World War II. The phenomenon ultimately led
the Justice Department to set up a special anti-Nazi unit, a $3.7
million program described by supporters as the most effective
anti-Nazi operation in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights monitors complain that the US government has
taken the presence of other war criminals less seriously than the
Nazis despite evidence that their numbers also are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the thousands,'' said Gerald Gray, who last year
founded the San Francisco-based Center for Justice and
Accountability, a nonprofit organization funded by Amnesty
International that strives to bring violators of human rights to
justice. The group has compiled information on dozens of cases and
has filed two lawsuits: one against a Bosnian Serb refugee in
Atlanta who allegedly tortured prisoners with pipes, bats, and
other deadly objects during the war in the Balkans. The other suit
is against a former Chilean secret police officer living in Miami
despite allegations that he tortured and executed a former
government official as part of a 1973 terror campaign under General
Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who ruled Chile from 1973-90, is under house arrest
outside London, awaiting a decision on whether he can be extradited
to Spain to face prosecution for crimes against humanity and
torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're everywhere _ Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, you name
it,'' said Gray.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Human rights stance
</P>
<P>
   raises troubling issues
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem raises a number of thorny questions for the United
States at a time when the Clinton administration has made human
rights a centerpiece of its foreign policy. To varying degrees, the
issue of how people are treated by their government has played a
role in nearly every military action undertaken by the
administration, including the recent NATO bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   However, the emphasis on human rights also has forced the United
States to confront its own past, and a number of uncomfortable
alliances that were forged, often in the name of fighting communism
during the Cold War. On a March trip to Guatemala, President
Clinton apologized for US support of Guatemalan military forces who
massacred tens of thousands of unarmed Mayan Indians during a
36-year civil war, which began in 1954 with a CIA-engineered coup
against a democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Pinochet, who also came to power with CIA
assistance, has shaken international law and emboldened human
rights advocates who believe the case has set a precedent for
holding perpetrators of atrocities accountable. Pinochet, who was
immune from prosecution in Chile after being declared Senator for
Life, was arrested last October after traveling to London for
surgery on a herniated disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a wake-up call for a lot of people,'' said Reed
Brody, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch in New York. ``The
rules of business-as-usual may change.''
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear how the new rules might be applied,
particularly in the United States, where laws make it difficult to
prosecute foreigners for crimes committed abroad. Up to now, human
rights advocates have relied on an obscure 1789 law, the Alien Tort
Claims Act, and difficult-to-enforce international treaties to
prosecute foreigners accused of atrocities. Their rare victories
have been mostly symbolic, such as a $47 million judgment in 1996
by a federal judge in Boston against a Guatemalan general held
responsible for the rape and torture of an American nun and nine
others. The general, Hector A. Gramajo, was hit with the lawsuit
just before his graduation from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government. He returned to Guatemala and has paid no compensation.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of alleged human rights offenders living in the
United States reads like a rogue's gallery from the worst armed
conflicts of recent years:
</P>
<P>
   --The Globe has discovered two Bosnian refugees who settled in
New England after allegedly participating in ethnic cleansing
operations in the former Yugoslavia. They are part of a spate of
recent reports of former Serb combatants who made their way to the
United States _ apparently by exploiting a chaotic refugee crisis
similar to the one now unfolding in Kosovo, as well as serious
weaknesses in the refugee screening process. Even before Kosovo,
the Serb campaign of murder, rape, torture, and mass deportation
had created some 2 million refugees in the Balkans, including
83,247 who entered the United States between 1993-98.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service regional office in
Portland, Maine, has opened an investigation into the case of a
39-year-old Bosnian Muslim in Burlington, Vt., after the Globe
developed evidence that he had been a member of a Serb paramilitary
unit that participated in the forced removal of some 60,000 Muslims
and Croats in northwestern Bosnia. The man denies being a member of
the unit.

   The INS also is conducting an investigation into the case of
Jezdimir Topic, 56, who settled with his family in the Boston
suburb of Everett after the war. The agency opened that probe after
witnesses told the Globe that Topic had been a guard at the
notorious Trnopolje prison camp, a converted schoolhouse where
numerous cases of murder, rape, and torture reportedly occurred.
Topic, who declined to comment, has not been accused of directly
participating in the atrocities, but witnesses said he did nothing
to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials said both men could be deported if the allegations
turn out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, another former member of a Serb paramilitary unit,
Dragan Borcic, entered the country as a refugee last year and is
employed at a meat-packing plant in Bismarck, N.D. Borcic confirmed
in an interview he was a member of the paramilitary group, but
said, ``We only attacked those people who had weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   --Dorelien, the Haitian colonel, told the Globe that 15
high-ranking military officers _ the entire junta, with the
exception of supreme commander Raoul Cedras and Brigadier General
Philippe Biamby, his chief of staff _ have been allowed to
immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dorelien, the list of former officers living in the
United States includes Major General Jean-Claude Duperval, the
regime's assistant commander-in-chief; Herbert Valmont, the head of
intelligence; and Ernst Prud'homme, a high-ranking member of the
Bureau du Informations et Coordination, a notoriously violent
propaganda unit.

   PRIJEDOR, Bosnia and Herzegovina _ Three years ago, Zijad Music
arrived in Burlington, Vt., directly from the war that ripped apart
this city. He has been working like a dog ever since. He moves
furniture by day and works in a bakery at night, getting home just
in time to see his two daughters head off to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' he said during a recent interview at a bar
in a Burlington mall. ``I'm really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Music is hardly a typical refugee of the war in the former
Yugoslavia. Although he entered the United States by portraying
himself as a victim of ethnic cleansing, Music appears to have been
a participant in one of the most brutal episodes of the war: the
deadly purge of some 60,000 non-Serbian civilians from Prijedor and
its surrounding villages in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Former Serb combatants, Bosnian refugees, and even Music's own
relatives identified Music as a former member of a ruthless
paramilitary unit that terrorized local Muslims and Croats during
the Serb army's campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The events here between 1992-95 were a grim preview of the
slaughter now taking place in Kosovo. A United Nations commission
concluded that the systematic application of murder, torture, rape,
and mass deportation in Prijedor constituted ``crimes against
humanity'' and probably genocide, resulting in the deaths of
thousands of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Music (pronounced Moo-shich), 39, denied he was ever part of the
much-feared paramilitary group, which called itself El Manijakos,
or The Maniacs.
</P>
<P>
   But Jean Ouellette, deputy district director of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service's regional office in Portland, Maine,
called the information gathered by the Globe about Music ``very,
very disturbing.'' Had the INS known of it beforehand, Ouellette
said, ``certainly the process wouldn't have resulted in the
granting of refugee status'' without an investigation of the
charges. He said the agency has begun a review of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Music's presence in Vermont has sparked fear and outrage within
Burlington's 4,000-member Bosnian community, and has raised
questions about the number of Serb collaborators who may have
slipped into the United States through the government's vast
refugee program, which provides a safe haven to tens of thousands
of people each year who are deemed to have been persecuted abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 83,247 Bosnian refugees who entered the United States
between 1993-98, most were Muslim and Croat civilians fleeing the
bloodiest war in Europe since World War II. However, in addition to
Music, there have been several recent reports of refugees with
possible links to ethnic cleansing who have surfaced in other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the INS opened an investigation into another Bosnian
refugee, Jezdimir Topic, after witnesses told the Globe that he had
served as a guard at the notorious Trnopolje prison camp outside
Prijedor before settling with his family in the Boston suburb of
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has identified another member of Music's paramilitary
group, Dragan Borcic, living in Bismarck, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are definitely part of a larger problem,'' said Shawn
Roberts, legal counsel for the Center for Justice and
Accountability, a San Francisco-based human rights organization
funded by Amnesty International. The group brought a civil suit
last year against Nikola Vuckovic, a Bosnian Serb refugee in
Atlanta who allegedly beat Muslim and Croat detainees with pipes,
bats, and other objects. The suit charges Vuckovic with genocide
and other crimes against humanity. He has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Music has not been charged with any crimes, and no suits have
been filed against him. He said people mistakenly have accused him
of being a member of El Manijakos because the Serbs forced him to
work as an accountant for the 43d Motorized Brigade, to which El
Manijakos reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are bitter and they're blaming me,'' he said, speaking
through a translator in his native Bosnian. ``I worked for the army
and so they automatically blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Music hinted that as a Bosnian Muslim who worked for
the Serbs, he may have taken actions he regrets to protect himself
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're supposed to save your own life, in a certain
situation, what are you supposed to do?'' he asked. ``I mean, you
have your family to protect and you're forced to do all kinds of
things. There were threats, and more threats, and then it all
played out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumping into one's persecutor after fleeing horrors experienced
thousands of miles away can be a refugee's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   One former Muslim resident of Prijedor who lives in Vermont and
requested anonymity, said of Music: ``I can't understand how the
aid agency and the American government could let him come in.
Everyone knows what he did. And they put him in Burlington, where
there are a lot of people from Prijedor.''
</P>
<P>
   US immigration officials did not interview Music before he
entered the country, said an INS official familiar with the case,
who added there is no indication he was even asked to fill out a
refugee application form, on which he would have been asked about
his military history. Music's persecution claim, the official said,
appeared to rest entirely on statements made by his wife, Asra, a
former nurse who was kidnapped and shot by Serb assailants along
with her mother and brother. Music's wife was the only one of the
three to survive the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what a great country we have,'' said the official, who
asked not to be named. ``A lot of the time in these refugee cases
it seems like they just throw open the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Music contended that the shooting proved that he and his family
had been persecuted by the Serbs like most Muslims in Prijedor.
However, several pieces of evidence suggest that the shootings _
which were confirmed by Serb military sources _ occurred despite
the fact that Music had been a member of one of the most dangerous
Serb ``hit squads.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence includes a homemade video, obtained by the Globe,
that shows Music wearing a distinctive El Manijakos patch on his
Serb uniform while serving as a pallbearer at the funeral of the
unit's commander, Dragan Janjetovic. The video also shows Music
drinking with about 30 members of El Manijakos, singing Serb
nationalist songs, and posing with a powerful M-34 machine gun
known to soldiers as the ``Sower of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Nusret Sivac, a former Bosnian Muslim resident of Prijedor,
identified Music as a member of El Manijakos in a book he wrote
about the Serb assault on the town. The unit, he said in an
interview, was ``responsible for doing the dirtiest deeds'' of
ethnic cleansing. ``They would do whatever they wanted: killing,
slaughtering, robbing, raping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of El Manijakos, Atko Blazevic, said in an
interview that he, Music, and five other members of the unit were
arrested and detained by Serb military police following a botched
1993 robbery attempt in which a woman was allegedly tortured.
Blazevic said the group had intended to force an elderly Muslim
couple from their home and give the house to a Serb family, a
common tactic used by the Serbs during ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Blazevic claimed that the crime wasn't his idea and that he
stayed outside the house while Music and the others went inside.
``You should ask Zijo about that; he was inside the house,'' said
Blazevic, using Music's nickname. ``He was with that old couple.
They picked him out when the military police came and asked who did
what.''
</P>
<P>
   Music said he was aware of accusations that he participated in
the crime but denied he committed it. Instead, he alleged that
Blazevic and three other members of El Manijakos were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about everything that happened there, but I wasn't
there,'' Music said.
</P>
<P>
   Semsa Suhonic, 67, said in an interview that while robbing her
home the attackers stuffed a rag in her mouth, kicked and beat her,
burned her breasts with cigarettes, dropped a heavy sack of corn on
her head, tried to hang her with a belt, slashed her clothes, and
drew a knife across her throat, cutting her, until she finally
begged them to kill her. The attack put her in the Prijedor
hospital for 12 days, according to a hospital certificate that
confirmed her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started burning my hair with matches and cigarettes,''
she said. ``Then one of them said, `Don't burn her hair, it smells.
Just light her on fire completely.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She said one of the men head-butted her several times, then, as
she slumped against a wood-paneled wall, stabbed a knife around her
head, and threatened to thrust it into her forehead if she refused
to give him money. She said the man then forced her to recite a
prayer from the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the police came they saw me all bloody and they asked,
`What did the guy who hit you the most look like?' '' said Suhonic,
who later gave her testimony to a Bosnian government commission
investigating war crimes. ``I said it was a balding guy, with a
black mustache, in a black coat. They said, `That's the Muslim,
grandma, that's our captain Ziko.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ziko is one of Music's nicknames. He has a receding hairline and
a mustache. Other refugees from Prijedor said he was often seen
wearing a black hat and coat.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bosnian refugees have cited Suhonic's account as evidence
that Music was one of the assailants. However, Suhonic was unable
to positively identify Music from a recent photo or pick him out of
the video of El Manijakos. She noted that six years had passed
since the incident. In addition, former members of the unit said
Music was not a captain but merely a soldier. Blazevic said the
group, including Music, was held for nearly a week by the Serbs,
then released.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military officials in Prijedor referred questions about
Music and El Manijakos to Major Milodrag Glusac of the 43d
Motorized Brigade. Glusac said he could not confirm the incident,
but that it sounded consistent with activities El Manijakos engaged
in, particularly when they drank.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Manijakos had problems with everybody when they got
drunk,'' Glusac said. He recalled Music as a good soldier who,
while a Muslim, was ``more of a Serb than half of the people in
Manijakos. . . . He performed his assignments very well. Of course
he did some small bad things, but everybody did a few bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   Music's apparent involvement with El Manijakos has left him
estranged from much of his family. His uncle, Sakib Music, said:
``He was worse than the Serbian Chetniks,'' the ultranationalists
charged with widespread abuses during the war. ``I'm his father's
younger brother, and I can tell you that he killed his father _ not
directly, but his father died of agony and suffering'' knowing what
Music had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd kill him if I could get my hands on him,'' Sakib Music
said.
</P>
<P>
   Music's aunt, Zekija Music, also said Music's father, Eniz, was
overcome with grief over his son's involvement with El Manijakos.
``He got sick and he died, yes, that's right,'' she said. But she
feels more pity than anger for her nephew. ``I feel bad for people
like Zijo, do you believe me?'' she said. ``The world has accused
them, condemned them. I feel bad because his own people hate him.
There's no more room for him with the Serbs or the Muslims. And
that's the real truth.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Little hint
</P>
<P>
   of horrors to come
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Music's relatives said he lived a rather ordinary life before
the war. A kung fu champion in his youth, he dressed well, worked
hard, and landed a job as an accountant at a state-run construction
company called Bosnamontaza. Eniz Music, his father, was one of the
most popular men in Prijedor, the helpful and affable manager of an
appliance store in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   Music courted his wife walking the promenades of Prijedor. Their
two daughters, said Sakib Music, ``are like golden apples.'' Zijad
Music's only affiliation with the military before the war was
mandatory duty as a reservist in the former Yugoslav army. Although
he is Muslim, he said his life wasn't much different than everyone
else's in Prijedor: he thought little of his ethnicity and counted
Serbs, Muslims, and Croats among his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine what kind of life we had,'' he said. ``We
had such a good life. For all of us to become enemies, when we all
speak the same language, when we all lived together so beautifully,
it was just like mass confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Music said he was still an army reservist when Yugoslavia began
to come apart in 1991. When the Serbs took over the military, he
said, they forced him to continue working ``on computers and
accounting. It was very difficult. Any mistake you made you could
be held accountable for; in a second you could be killed.'' He said
he left the military for good in 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I never carried a gun in Prijedor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Music's relatives and former Serb combatants tell a
different story. When Croatia declared its independence, they said,
Music was called up to fight for the Yugoslav army. By the time he
returned, they said, he was a changed man: a fervent Serb
nationalist and a member of El Manijakos, a terrifying, previously
unknown group of about 50 soldiers who quickly gained a reputation
for alcohol-fueled mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear why Music would choose to fight with the
Serbs, an act akin to a Jew fighting for the Nazis. Most Muslims
and Croats were weeded out of the military as the Serbs began to
execute their plan to create a Greater Serbia by ``cleansing'' all
non-Serbs from the region. Prijedor was key to that strategy,
completing a corridor connecting Serbia and Croatia. Some non-Serbs
literally fled the battlefield and switched sides. Of the few who
stayed, most were driven by self-interest or self-preservation as
the situation around Prijedor turned into a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had all these lunatics running around with automatic
weapons,'' said Niaz Sedic, a former Prijedor school principal,
dragging on a cigarette in his Burlington apartment. ``And a Muslim
life was worth less than this puff of smoke I'm about to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Prijedor gained international attention with the discovery that
the Serbs were herding Muslim and Croat prisoners from the area
into camps at Omarska, Keraterm, and Trnopolje, then torturing and
killing thousands of them. Last year, a 356-page book of missing
people from the region was published. Most are believed to be
buried in dozens of mass graves that continue to be discovered. In
some cases, the Serbs razed entire villages: An estimated 9,800
homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   According to 1991 census figures, 49,454 Muslims lived in
Prijedor and its surrounding villages before the war. Today, there
are about 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of why he fought with us, I just know they didn't
force him,'' Milenko Gloginja, another former member of El
Manijakos, said of Music. ``No one forced him to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   El Manijakos quickly became part of the panorama of horror,
according to Bosnian refugees, one of dozens of paramilitary groups
employed by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mirsad Tokaca, who heads the Bosnian War Crimes Commission in
Sarajevo, said the paramilitary groups were essentially well-armed
gangs that often committed the worst abuses. He said they were used
by the Serbs ``to cover themselves and transfer responsibility.
They could just say, `It wasn't us: The paramilitary groups
committed these crimes.' It's so transparent, but that's the way it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of El Manijakos began to spread at the end of the war in
Croatia, when a small band of scruffy-looking soldiers roared into
Prijedor on a tank they had captured on the battlefield. The tank
became the unit's symbol, appearing on the patch the soldiers wore
on their uniforms. Many of the fighters were apparently recruited
right off the street: The commander, Dragan Janjetovic, was a local
carpenter, according to Gloginja, and other fighters included
bartenders, miners, and bus drivers. The unit's movements were
loosely guided by the 43d Motorized Brigade, which sent the group
out on high-risk missions that the soldiers seemed to relish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to have a strong heart to do what we did,'' said
Gloginja. For help, he said, members of El Manijakos drank
``anything we could get our hands on: plum brandy, cognac, whatever
we could find. If you're going to go into battle, you're going to
have to drink, of course. It helps you go forward. It gives you
more courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nusret Sivac, who wrote the book on ethnic cleansing in
Prijedor, said El Manijakos operated openly. ``People knew them
because they would brag about being part of El Manijakos,'' he
said. ``They didn't hide it. They were very proud. When the Serbs
took over Prijedor they went from cafe to cafe, restaurant to
restaurant. Once I saw them destroy an entire restaurant, like in a
western.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Bosnian refugees said El Manijakos played a role in one
of the most notorious incidents in Prijedor: the laying waste of
Muharem Suljanovic Street, a relatively prosperous two-lane road
that rambles through the city. Using its tank, El Manijakos
allegedly blew up Muslim houses. The wreckage is still visible in
the charred masses of concrete and the garbage-strewn lots where
homes belonging to Muslim families once stood.
</P>
<P>
   Atko Blazevic, the former member of El Manijakos, said that
drinking altered Music's behavior. ``Whatever stupid things Zijo
did, he always did them when he was drunk,'' he said, refusing to
be specific. ``He wasn't a stable character even before he was with
us,'' said Blazevic. ``He'd drink, then he'd shoot off his mouth
and get violent.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gloginja said Music has been criticized simply because
he was a Muslim who fought with the Serbs: ``They say, `Look, he's
fighting against his own people.' That's why people are against
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Music may have believed he could protect his family. Former
Prijedor residents said Music's wife was allowed to keep her job as
a nurse long after the Serbs had fired most Muslims and Croats in
town. Sakib Music said his nephew came around once ``to ask me if I
had any problems, if any of the Serbs had touched me. I said, `I
don't need anything from you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Music's family was in fact protected, that ended in 1995. He
apparently was already in trouble with the Serbs. According to
Gloginja, Serb military police arrested Music in 1995 and briefly
jailed him for pouring gasoline into the oil tank of a military
vehicle. Serb military officals apparently suspected him of
sabotage, but Gloginja said Music was drunk and did it by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Major Milodrag Glusac, of the 43d Motorized Brigade, confirmed
the incident but said he was unsure of Music's motives.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear if Music's arrest was related in some way to the
Serbs' attack on his family. Bosnian refugees familiar with Music
said they believed the Serbs were trying to take over the apartment
of Music's mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Gloginja said he went to see Music shortly after the Serbs had
shot his family. ``Believe me, he didn't say, `Thank you, Serbs,'
'' said Gloginja. ``He said, `Goddamn you. I've been fighting with
you for four years and this is what you do for me?' '' After the
shootings, Gloginja said, Music knew ``he had to go to another
side, a third side. He didn't know who had done it, so he was
afraid they would come to his door and do the same to him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   False papers used
</P>
<P>
   to escape Prijedor
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Music made his way to the United States shortly after he was
released from jail. He said he was forced to use false papers _ he
said he used Gloginja's name _ to escape Prijedor. ``I can't
explain how terrifying it was,'' he said. ``You're terrified that
you're going to see somebody who knows you, and they'll call you by
your name and turn you over to the police.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bosnian refugees pointed out that Music traveled to
Belgrade, the Serbian capital, instead of Croatia, where most
Muslims seeking asylum fled. They said it was an indication that
Music left with the consent of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Remmel, of the International Organization for Migration,
which assisted the INS in screening Music, said the fact that Music
is Muslim yet came through Belgrade ``is alarming, but more in
hindsight.'' He said privacy restrictions forbid him from talking
about Music's case. However, he said responsibility for determining
the merits of Music's persecution claim resided with the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not really something we focus on,'' he said. ``It's
something for the INS to delve into.''
</P>
<P>
   Music said he received affidavits of support from relatives in
Burlington to help him with his case. ``Nothing good has happened
to me the last five or six years,'' he said. ``The only good thing
was when I first got here. You should have seen it. I got out of
the airplane and kissed the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he has settled into a relatively normal life. He
said his wife continues to be haunted by memories of Prijedor and
cries into the night, but he pushes the memories out of his mind.
``There are horrible things that you think about,'' he said. ``You
try to push them down inside of you but they keep coming back to
your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Music said he has heard rumors that other refugees might pursue
him. Asked if he had been threatened, he said, ``Threat is a big
word, but there was a lot of talk. I didn't pay too much attention
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Bosnian refugees in Vermont clearly live in fear of Music.
One man, after guiding a reporter to the used-furniture store where
Music works, refused to go within several blocks of the building.
The man, who like most refugees asked that his name not be used,
said refugees don't know where to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do, go to the Burlington police station
and tell them this guy is a war criminal?'' he said. ``Good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman from Prijedor, who said she saw Music
``countless'' times with other members of El Manijakos, said she
would be terrified to run into him in Burlington. ``I used to go
down to the market to sell things, and when you heard El Manijakos
was in the market you'd just get your stuff and run,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiko Zjakic, who now works as a brewer, said he happened to be
at the Burlington airport picking up a friend the same day Music
arrived. Before coming to the United States, Zjakic was held by the
Serbs at the Omarska prison camp, where thousands of men were
starved, tortured, and killed in perhaps the worst crimes against
humanity in Europe since the Nazi concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   When Zjakic saw Music, he said, he couldn't believe his eyes. He
said the last time he had seen him, Music was carrying a gun on the
streets of Prijedor as a member of El Manijakos.
</P>
<P>
   As Music approached, Zjakic looked away. ``Those were the same
people who put me in the camp,'' he said.

AMERICAN INDIANS WIN SMALL VICTORY AT DEVILS TOWER

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune  
American Indians won another court battle over their right to
worship without interference at Devils Tower National Monument in
the northeast corner of Wyoming. Unfortunately, the victory at the
10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver wasn't along constitutional
lines, which would have provided greater leverage for tribal
worship at other sacred sites located on public lands.
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 20 Plains Indian tribes consider the 600-foot butte,
Devils Tower, a sacred site. Archaeological evidence shows that the
ancestors of the Lakota Tribes lived in the area a thousand years
ago. The site has also been a significant part of the religious and
cultural beliefs of the Sioux and other Northern Plains Indians.
Tribes travel to the tower to perform the Sun Dance and vision
quests during the month of June, around the time of the summer
solstice.
</P>
<P>
   The monument is also a premiere crack climbing site.
Approximately 6,000 climbers attempt to scale the tower each year
using the 220 routes to the top. Chas Cartwright, who has been the
superintendent of the national monument since March 1997, says that
prior to 1994, approximately 1,200 to 1,400 climbers visited during
the month of June.
</P>
<P>
   Climbers sometimes must replace metal bolts and metal pitons in
the rock face of the tower for their own safety. And the climbing
requires them to yell advice to their climbing partners. Obviously,
such activities interfere with the solitude and solemnity required
for tribal religious ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   That's the clash: climbing vs. praying. The National Park
Service brought diverse groups together, including climbers and
American Indians, to work out a plan that might satisfy the needs
of both groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Final Climbing Management Plan for Devils Tower National
Monument requests that climbers voluntarily refrain from climbing
during the month of June. Cartwright says that since the plan was
implemented in 1994, the number of climbers in June has dropped to
approximately 200.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been clear sailing. A few disgruntled commercial
climbers, Andy Petefish, Kenneth Anderson, Gregory Hauber and Wes
Bush, challenged the management plan. They were joined in the
lawsuit by the Bear Lodge Multiple Use Association. The Mountain
States Legal Foundation in Denver represents them. It should be
noted that the commercial climbers who brought the lawsuit continue
to climb the tower during the month of June.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers and the association lost at the federal district
level. The district court found that since the climbing plan was
modified to make the June climbing ban voluntary, the plan is
constitutional and within the Department of Interior's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   William Perry Pendley, president and chief legal advisor of the
legal foundation, in oral argument before the circuit court of
appeals, took the position that the climbing management plan
unconstitutionally promotes religion _ in this case, various
American Indian religious beliefs. Pendley argued that the plan
violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by
pressuring climbers to stop climbing in June in order that tribal
people may worship peacefully at the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Pendley neglected to point out, as the appellate court did, that
a number of laws ``allow ... temporary closure of specific tribal
sacred sites located on federal lands.'' The appellate court's
decision lists two such sites in a footnote: El Malpais Monument
and the Cibola Historical Park, both in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Law Resource Center in Washington, D.C., as an
intervenor representing the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and four
prominent Indian spiritual leaders, also pointed out to the court
that the National Park Service owns Christian churches and
religious properties and has a long tradition of allowing groups
``to conduct religious services on these properties, and it
prohibits recreational or other activities that would conflict with
the religious services.''
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court did not decide the question as to
whether accommodating American Indian religious ceremonies at
Devils Tower violates the Constitution. The court never reached
that question. It decided the case on much simpler grounds: Did
those who brought the lawsuit have standing to do so? No, said the
unanimous court.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has outlined three conditions necessary
to establish standing in a court of law: 1) The plaintiff must have
suffered a concrete and specific injury because of an intrusion on
legally protected interests; 2) there must be a causal connection
between the injury and the conduct that brought the complaint; and
3) it must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a
decision favorable to the plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in this case failed to prove they suffered any
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial climbers continue to climb in June, the members
of the Bear Lodge Multiple Use Association who do not climb in June
could if they wished. The court singled out Andy Petefish and
stated in its decision that he ``did not substantiate his claim of
economic injury as a result of the voluntary closure, and he has
provided no additional substantiation here.'' The court pointed out
that ``standing is not measured by the intensity of the litigant's
interest or the fervor of his advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pendley said in an interview Friday that he intends to file a
request for a hearing before the entire 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals. He noted that such en banc hearings are rarely approved,
but he feels that the court did not apply the law correctly in
regard to Establishment Clause precedence. Pendley contends that
the so-called voluntary ban creates injury to the parties because
it violates their constitutional right not to be coerced to
accommodate a religion by a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Gunn, of Volunteer Lawyers in Boston who represented the
Indian Law Resource Center, said that he would be surprised if the
circuit court accepted Pendley's request. The court's ruling on
standing was straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright said that his staff would do an internal review of
the climbing management plan in late summer or fall, after they see
how the voluntary climbing ban works this June. He said the plan
had ``achieved a good level of success'' and that he ``plans to
stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court gave tribes a narrow win on this issue, but
a win, nevertheless. The court felt that once it ruled on the
plaintiffs' standing, it didn't need to address the constitutional
question. That's standard jurisprudence. If a case can be decided
on other issues, courts refrain from addressing constitutional
questions.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a greater victory for all American Indians
had the court decided that the management plan did not violate the
Establishment Clause. Had the court done so, the positive
ramifications for tribal religious ceremonies would have reached
across the nation. Thus, this victory is bittersweet.

   Last week, this column addressed the harassment of freelance
journalist Peter Sussman. The California attorney general's office
had subpoenaed 10 years of writings, records and documents that
Sussman had created while reporting on the California prison system
and the restrictions it has put on news media access to inmates. He
was subpoenaed as a result of being listed as a possible witness in
an inmate's case against the warden of a California prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sussman had been ordered to appear in court on April 29 for a
hearing on releasing his records. The hearing never occurred. New
Attorney General Bill Lockyer, an advocate of the First Amendment,
ordered negotiations to reach a reasonable settlement and quashed
the subpoena. Sussman agreed to the settlement.

 PRIJEDOR, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA:... in 1993.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I never carried a gun in Prijedor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Music's relatives and former Serb combatants tell a
different story. When Croatia declared its independence, they said,
Music was called up to fight for the Yugoslav army. By the time he
returned, they said, he was a changed man: a fervent Serb
nationalist and a member of El Manijakos, a terrifying, previously
unknown group of about 50 soldiers who quickly gained a reputation
for alcohol-fueled mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear why Music would choose to fight with the
Serbs, an act akin to a Jew fighting for the Nazis. Most Muslims
and Croats were weeded out of the military as the Serbs began to
execute their plan to create a Greater Serbia by ``cleansing'' all
non-Serbs from the region. Prijedor was key to that strategy,
completing a corridor connecting Serbia and Croatia. Some non-Serbs
literally fled the battlefield and switched sides. Of the few who
stayed, most were driven by self-interest or self-preservation as
the situation around Prijedor turned into a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had all these lunatics running around with automatic
weapons,'' said Niaz Sedic, a former Prijedor school principal,
dragging on a cigarette in his Burlington apartment. ``And a Muslim
life was worth less than this puff of smoke I'm about to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Prijedor gained international attention with the discovery that
the Serbs were herding Muslim and Croat prisoners from the area
into camps at Omarska, Keraterm, and Trnopolje, then torturing and
killing thousands of them. Last year, a 356-page book of missing
people from the region was published. Most are believed to be
buried in dozens of mass graves that continue to be discovered. In
some cases, the Serbs razed entire villages: An estimated 9,800
homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   According to 1991 census figures, 49,454 Muslims lived in
Prijedor and its surrounding villages before the war. Today, there
are about 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of why he fought with us, I just know they didn't
force him,'' Milenko Gloginja, another former member of El
Manijakos, said of Music. ``No one forced him to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   El Manijakos quickly became part of the panorama of horror,
according to Bosnian refugees, one of dozens of paramilitary groups
employed by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mirsad Tokaca, who heads the Bosnian War Crimes Commission in
Sarajevo, said the paramilitary groups were essentially well-armed
gangs that often committed the worst abuses. He said they were used
by the Serbs ``to cover themselves and transfer responsibility.
They could just say, `It wasn't us: The paramilitary groups
committed these crimes.' It's so transparent, but that's the way it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of El Manijakos began to spread at the end of the war in
Croatia, when a small band of scruffy-looking soldiers roared into
Prijedor on a tank they had captured on the battlefield. The tank
became the unit's symbol, appearing on the patch the soldiers wore
on their uniforms. Many of the fighters were apparently recruited
right off the street: The commander, Dragan Janjetovic, was a local
carpenter, according to Gloginja, and other fighters included
bartenders, miners, and bus drivers. The unit's movements were
loosely guided by the 43d Motorized Brigade, which sent the group
out on high-risk missions that the soldiers seemed to relish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to have a strong heart to do what we did,'' said
Gloginja. For help, he said, members of El Manijakos drank
``anything we could get our hands on: plum brandy, cognac, whatever
we could find. If you're going to go into battle, you're going to
have to drink, of course. It helps you go forward. It gives you
more courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nusret Sivac, who wrote the book on ethnic cleansing in
Prijedor, said El Manijakos operated openly. ``People knew them
because they would brag about being part of El Manijakos,'' he
said. ``They didn't hide it. They were very proud. When the Serbs
took over Prijedor they went from cafe to cafe, restaurant to
restaurant. Once I saw them destroy an entire restaurant, like in a
western.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Bosnian refugees said El Manijakos played a role in one
of the most notorious incidents in Prijedor: the laying waste of
Muharem Suljanovic Street, a relatively prosperous two-lane road
that rambles through the city. Using its tank, El Manijakos
allegedly blew up Muslim houses. The wreckage is still visible in
the charred masses of concrete and the garbage-strewn lots where
homes belonging to Muslim families once stood.
</P>
<P>
   Atko Blazevic, the former member of El Manijakos, said that
drinking altered Music's behavior. ``Whatever stupid things Zijo
did, he always did them when he was drunk,'' he said, refusing to
be specific. ``He wasn't a stable character even before he was with
us,'' said Blazevic. ``He'd drink, then he'd shoot off his mouth
and get violent.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gloginja said Music has been criticized simply because
he was a Muslim who fought with the Serbs: ``They say, `Look, he's
fighting against his own people.' That's why people are against
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Music may have believed he could protect his family. Former
Prijedor residents said Music's wife was allowed to keep her job as
a nurse long after the Serbs had fired most Muslims and Croats in
town. Sakib Music said his nephew came around once ``to ask me if I
had any problems, if any of the Serbs had touched me. I said, `I
don't need anything from you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Music's family was in fact protected, that ended in 1995. He
apparently was already in trouble with the Serbs. According to
Gloginja, Serb military police arrested Music in 1995 and briefly
jailed him for pouring gasoline into the oil tank of a military
vehicle. Serb military officals apparently suspected him of
sabotage, but Gloginja said Music was drunk and did it by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Major Milodrag Glusac, of the 43d Motorized Brigade, confirmed
the incident but said he was unsure of Music's motives.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear if Music's arrest was related in some way to the
Serbs' attack on his family. Bosnian refugees familiar with Music
said they believed the Serbs were trying to take over the apartment
of Music's mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Gloginja said he went to see Music shortly after the Serbs had
shot his family. ``Believe me, he didn't say, `Thank you, Serbs,'
'' said Gloginja. ``He said, `Goddamn you. I've been fighting with
you for four years and this is what you do for me?' '' After the
shootings, Gloginja said, Music knew ``he had to go to another
side, a third side. He didn't know who had done it, so he was
afraid they would come to his door and do the same to him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   False papers used
</P>
<P>
   to escape Prijedor
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Music made his way to the United States shortly after he was
released from jail. He said he was forced to use false papers _ he
said he used Gloginja's name _ to escape Prijedor. ``I can't
explain how terrifying it was,'' he said. ``You're terrified that
you're going to see somebody who knows you, and they'll call you by
your name and turn you over to the police.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bosnian refugees pointed out that Music traveled to
Belgrade, the Serbian capital, instead of Croatia, where most
Muslims seeking asylum fled. They said it was an indication that
Music left with the consent of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Remmel, of the International Organization for Migration,
which assisted the INS in screening Music, said the fact that Music
is Muslim yet came through Belgrade ``is alarming, but more in
hindsight.'' He said privacy restrictions forbid him from talking
about Music's case. However, he said responsibility for determining
the merits of Music's persecution claim resided with the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not really something we focus on,'' he said. ``It's
something for the INS to delve into.''
</P>
<P>
   Music said he received affidavits of support from relatives in
Burlington to help him with his case. ``Nothing good has happened
to me the last five or six years,'' he said. ``The only good thing
was when I first got here. You should have seen it. I got out of
the airplane and kissed the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he has settled into a relatively normal life. He
said his wife continues to be haunted by memories of Prijedor and
cries into the night, but he pushes the memories out of his mind.
``There are horrible things that you think about,'' he said. ``You
try to push them down inside of you but they keep coming back to
your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Music said he has heard rumors that other refugees might pursue
him. Asked if he had been threatened, he said, ``Threat is a big
word, but there was a lot of talk. I didn't pay too much attention
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Bosnian refugees in Vermont clearly live in fear of Music.
One man, after guiding a reporter to the used-furniture store where
Music works, refused to go within several blocks of the building.
The man, who like most refugees asked that his name not be used,
said refugees don't know where to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do, go to the Burlington police station
and tell them this guy is a war criminal?'' he said. ``Good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman from Prijedor, who said she saw Music
``countless'' times with other members of El Manijakos, said she
would be terrified to run into him in Burlington. ``I used to go
down to the market to sell things, and when you heard El Manijakos
was in the market you'd just get your stuff and run,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiko Zjakic, who now works as a brewer, said he happened to be
at the Burlington airport picking up a friend the same day Music
arrived. Before coming to the United States, Zjakic was held by the
Serbs at the Omarska prison camp, where thousands of men were
starved, tortured, and killed in perhaps the worst crimes against
humanity in Europe since the Nazi concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   When Zjakic saw Music, he said, he couldn't believe his eyes. He
said the last time he had seen him, Music was carrying a gun on the
streets of Prijedor as a member of El Manijakos.
</P>
<P>
   As Music approached, Zjakic looked away. ``Those were the same
people who put me in the camp,'' he said.

 &HT;    Ohio city has one year to prepare for minor league team
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They have league permission, they have a name,
now they need to build a home.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Monday that the new Class A minor league
baseball team coming to Dayton next year will be dubbed the Dragons
leaves the team a little less than a year to build a stadium, sell
tickets and make inroads into the region's entertainment-buying
subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   A marketing campaign is under way to introduce the team to the
Dayton metropolitan region. The team's lead owners, Mandalay Sports
Entertainment, are going to target Springfield to Xenia to
Middletown and all points in between to create a base of fans for
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great opportunity for baseball here and for us as a
company,'' said Paul Schaeffer, a California entertainment
executive and one of Mandalay's investors.
</P>
<P>
   The team already has a little more than 1,800 down payments for
season tickets for the 7,500-seat stadium under construction near
Patterson Boulevard and Monument Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The layout of the seats will be determined by this summer, team
officials said. Then, depositors will be contacted in the order
they put their money in and given the opportunity to pick seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God we have another year to plan for this,'' said Hank
Stickney, Mandalay Sports Entertainment's CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Seat prices have not been set but are expected to range between
$4 and $8 a game.
</P>
<P>
   The team is already unloading a host of Dragon-emblazoned
T-shirts, caps, sweatshirts and memorabilia to spread the name.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise will be available initially through the team offices
at 500 East First St., across the street from the stadium
construction site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important both from a revenue standpoint but it is more
important from a team identification standpoint,'' said Dragons
President Robert Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, construction crews are due to begin pouring concrete
on the northwest corner of the stadium site near Monument Avenue
and River Corridor Drive.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium site is now a deep muddy pit but the construction
schedule calls for the playing field to be in place by fall.
Construction on the stands and concourse will begin this summer.
The stadium is scheduled to open in April, 2000 as the new home for
the Class A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the stadium is still up for bid. Stickney said they
are negotiating with three local firms to sell the naming rights to
the stadium.

 &HT;    Where have the Majorettes gone?
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the toss, flip and look-fabulous
world of competitive baton-twirling, hair can matter as much as
hand-eye coordination.
</P>
<P>
   That's why 17-year-old Katie Noland sports a modified Dorothy
Hamill 'do. She wants to distinguish herself from hundreds of
long-tressed, limber-limbed, stick-lobbing competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Katie's spin needs doctoring. In a 14-year twirling
career, she's won more than 300 trophies. In July, the reigning
Advanced Teenage Miss Majorette of the Southeast will head to the
national Miss Majorette contest at Notre Dame University, where she
pulled down a sixth-place finish last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Palm Beach resident's latest coup: a free, two-week
trip to Peru this September to spread the twirling gospel. When she
arrives, Katie will be greeted by two bodyguards who'll escort her
on a tour that will include parades, performances and meetings with
South American royalty.
</P>
<P>
   To nab a spot in that 12-girl lineup, the brunette faced a
challenge more daunting than flying knives (which Katie has been
known to twirl): Peruvians prefer blondes. The trip organizer
``said it didn't matter if I wasn't blond,'' Katie says. ``She said
I had a lot of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   You throw, girl!
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the mighty majorette, in her sassy sequins
and pompommed boots, was envied by campus coeds everywhere. Over
the past two decades, though, she has pretty much pranced off the
football field and into gymnasiums where competitions are held.
</P>
<P>
   Twirlers still suit up at the University of Florida, although
there's not much competition to wear the Gatorette uniform.
Gatorette instructor June Stoeber said 24 young women auditioned
for next year's squad of 16.
</P>
<P>
   And a few local high school bands still field twirlers. Atlantic
High School in Delray Beach had five last fall, while regional
champs Wellington High boasted 14. (A baton instructor starts
training girls in elementary school, Wellington's band director
says.) And there's Katie, the sole twirler at Suncoast High School.
</P>
<P>
   A disappearing breed
</P>
<P>
   But most area schools don't have even a single majorette to
march with their bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a twirler in 20 years, at least,'' says Willie
Pyfrom at Glades Central Community High in Belle Glade. Jupiter
High School has been majorette-free for almost a decade, and it's
been even longer at Martin County High School in Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, the drum-and-bugle-corps movement swept the
nation, says Rob Roadman, band director of the Martin County Tiger
Regiment. Quick-step marches up and down the field were out,
classical selections and show tunes were in.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers and members of the flag corps elbowed twirlers out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the repertoire changed, the drill design changed,''
Roadman says. ``The football field is now a stage more than a
gridiron.''
</P>
<P>
   John I. Leonard High School abandoned its twirling troupe two
years ago for artistic reasons: A fast-moving baton doesn't show up
that well on the 50-yard line. ``Batons are kind of small and thin,
but a 10-foot flag is colorful and more visible,'' says David
Skinner, Leonard's assistant band director.
</P>
<P>
   (Flip through the 1975 Leonard high yearbook, however, and
you'll find four pages devoted to the school's twirlers. The
Leonard Majorettes numbered 20 that year, and the junior varsity
Twirlettes consisted of 16 girls.)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond aesthetics, there's the passage of Title IX in 1972,
which requires schools to provide girls with equal sports
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many more opportunities now,'' says Paula Welch,
professor of exercise and sports sciences at the University of
Florida. ``There are just so many other things that girls can
participate in,'' often with the possibility of weighty
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Twirling's development also has been hampered by a lack of role
models, promotion and fans, Welch says. People just don't show up
to watch twirling competitions in the same number as football games
or soccer matches, she says.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the image problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pop culture avatars Jane and Michael Stern included baton
twirling in their Encyclopedia of Bad Taste, between Barbie dolls
and beer. ``Despite the extraordinary coordination it requires,''
the Sterns wrote in 1990, ``baton twirling is one of those exotic
athletic skills, like bowling-pin juggling or musical spoons, that
grow increasingly kitschy as its routines become more elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   The flying baton is even something of a rarity at Miss America
pageants. Only Miss Illinois twirled in the 1998 contest; Miss
Oklahoma alone upheld the twirling tradition the year before.
(Local trivia: Twirler Kylene Barker Brandon, a West Palm Beacher
competing as Miss Virginia, was crowned Miss America 1979.)
</P>
<P>
   But Katie says the Sterns and other detractors are just out of
step with the times. ``Obviously they haven't seen twirlers of the
new age. There's a new trick made up every five minutes that you'll
probably only see once in your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody should take those people to a contest so they could
see what it's like now. It's nothing like it was 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   She's got many abilities
</P>
<P>
   Katie first picked up a baton at the age of 3. But before
pigeonholing her as little more than a figure-eighting anachronism,
consider these numbers:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Suncoast senior scored a 1580 on her SATs. That's a 780 on
the verbal portion, a perfect 800 in math.
</P>
<P>
   _ She plans to major in math at either the University of Miami
or the University of Central Florida, which she'll enter as a
junior thanks to a hefty load of advanced-placement credits.
</P>
<P>
   _ For two years in a row she's won first place in the area
Martin Luther King Jr. art contest.
</P>
<P>
   _ She's school vice president and has earned the nickname ``Fire
Marshal Katie'' for her flame-throwing routines with Suncoast's
Chargersonic Sound marching band. ``I don't have to wear hair spray
so that's not a problem, but I have burned the hair off my arms,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Katie sees nothing unusual about possessing a mathematician's
mind, an artist's eye and an athlete's quick hands on her 5-foot-3
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twirling is my sport, art is my hobby, and math is my study,''
she says, taking a break from practice at Royal Palm Beach's rec
center.
</P>
<P>
   Hold on a minute. Twirling's a sport?
</P>
<P>
   ``World Book Encyclopedia, 1989,'' Katie recites. ``The first
sentence says, `Twirling is a sport.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I sweat just as much as these guys,'' she says, motioning to
the basketball players behind her at Royal Palm Beach's rec center,
where she practices five days a week. ``I probably practice twice
as hard. I have the same feelings they do about competition, and I
go through the same letdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   And, chances are, she follows the advice of more coaches. She's
under the tutelage of four private coaches, one in New York, two in
Fort Lauderdale and a local ballet teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Twirling's relative rarity is what appeals to Katie, who plans
to continue twirling in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being different,'' she says. ``Like with the hair
thing, it makes me stand out.''

 &HT;    Ways to rebel more noticeable now
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Three teens dressed in black coats and
wearing combat boots were handcuffed and taken into custody at the
site of the Columbine massacre. They were questioned and
subsequently released. One of the boys explained they were just
``three punks with a lot of curiosity.'' He said they were probably
singled out because of what they were wearing and their overall
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no duh! He's probably right. It's tough to blend with a
crowd of average joes when you're wearing a ring through your
tongue and sporting a pony tail atop a shaved head. Purple hair
doesn't help either.
</P>
<P>
   Now don't go giving me the old tolerance lecture. Heck, I
practically invented it, but lately an odd thing has been
happening. I think I'm turning into my mother. I swore that could
never be _ but here it is _ geezer gap-osis.
</P>
<P>
   Take the weirdness in stride, I tell myself. Stop gawking at
striped hair and half-bared butts. They're not indicators of the
person inside. I'm listening, but I don't think I'm getting it. I'm
still judging the book by its cover.
</P>
<P>
   What I wear may not reflect the real me (whatever that might be
since my generation was never encouraged to get out and ``find
ourselves''), but I can bet you dollars to doughnuts that if I
checked into the classroom one morning wearing combat boots and
black lipstick, my principal would send me to counseling so they
could figure out just how far off level my bubble had bounced.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a typical teen-ager (and I was), youthful rebellion
wasn't quite as noticeable as it is today, mainly because nobody
was worried about kids' rights. Hell, we didn't even know we had
any. Our parents never let on.
</P>
<P>
   Long before I knew the word ``rebel,'' I guess I was one. When I
was six, I lost interest in school and from time-to-time wandered
off to the ice cream store or sometimes, the library. It wasn't
long before the ice cream man and the librarian wised up to my
peregrinations and squealed on me. Eventually, by means of coercion
and an outright violation of my juvenile rights, the big people got
their point across. I stayed in school.
</P>
<P>
   When I was eight, I discovered lamb chops didn't grow in
somebody's garden and in a fit of revolt, refused to eat meat. That
lasted a week.
</P>
<P>
   In junior high I decided to test the school's dress code by
showing up one morning in jeans and one of my father's dress
shirts. The principal bounced me out on my (r)ear and my mother
explained that if I insisted on (SET ITAL)wearing(END ITAL) said
shirts, I'd have to learn to (SET ITAL)iron(END ITAL) them. The
insurrection was called off due to laziness.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, I spent all of my lunch money on cherry pie and
iced tea, and when my mother asked what I'd had for lunch, which
she did daily, I'd lie. ``Meat loaf and green beans,'' I'd say. A
small fabrication that kept us both happy.
</P>
<P>
   My best friend Jeanne had some pretty cool ideas about
rebelling. Her favorite was refusing to iron her clothes. Today,
nobody would notice, but back in the days of dotted swiss and
crinolines, a person's character, home life, and birth sign could
be read in a wrinkle. One time she painted her toenails with green
porch paint and for a month was too embarrassed to wear sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Lately I've found myself wondering if our parents were as
offended with our jalopies and rolled up jeans as we are now with
kids who show up for school looking like Count Dracula complete
with white makeup and faux blood droplets on their chins. Maybe
they were. And maybe I (SET ITAL)am(END ITAL) turning into my
mother, but an odd notion keeps running through my old fogey brain:
As long as the geezers are still running the world, maybe the
weirdos ought to be careful how loudly they demand we stop it and
let them off. Some days it's mighty tempting.

RIGHTS VIOLATORS EXPLOIT US IMMIGRATION SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the years following World War II, US immigration officials
made a shocking discovery. Among the waves of refugees fleeing the
Holocaust were hundreds, perhaps thousands, of former Nazis who
managed to slip into the United States by posing as victims of
their own crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon became something of a national scandal, and in
1979 the Justice Department set up an Office of Special
Investigations. Armed with attorneys and multilingual historians
who pored over the Nazis' voluminous archives, the unit has
stripped 61 former perpetrators of their citizenship, deported 48,
and compiled a ``watch list'' of some 60,000 suspected war
criminals for possible exclusion from the United States
</P>
<P>
   ``I am now the world's longest-serving prosecutor of World War
II cases,'' said Eli M. Rosenbaum, who directs the $3.7 million
program.
</P>
<P>
   The success of OSI, now often viewed as the world's most
effective Nazi-fighting organization, has been held up by human
rights activists as an example of what the US government can do to
address the growing problem of modern war criminals who also have
quietly sought refuge in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to keep out people who commit human rights crimes _
then track them down once they slip through _ remain inadequate,
critics said. Lacking a coherent strategy, the government is
hamstrung by archaic laws that can bar members of the Communist
Party from entering the country but also prevent the deportation of
people accused of atrocities. Immigration officials lack resources
to track suspected offenders, or investigate their crimes once they
are discovered. The Immigration and Naturalization Service
acknowledges that it has no idea how many human rights offenders
might be in the United States, nor has it bothered to keep track of
how many such people it has deported.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the same process that allowed the Nazis to enter
the country following World War II is being repeated, critics said.
Although the magnitude of the problem is unclear, human rights
criminals from other global hot spots are exploiting weaknesses in
the government's refugee program, which admits tens of thousands of
persecuted people each year. In addition, government agencies
sometimes seem to act out of competing political interests, such as
when US officials granted visas to Haitian military leaders in
1994, even after US troops had removed them from power.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is a vastly complicated one for the United States,
which for decades has offered a safe haven to millions of
persecuted people around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American government is trying to open their arms, but at
the same time close their eyes to what is happening,'' said Ahmed
Samater, who has helped immigration officials document former
members of Somali strongman Mohammed Siad Barre's murderous regime
who have settled in the United States and Canada. ``Nobody wants to
have a neighbor who's a torturer or a killer.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Yusuf Abdi Ali, a former Somali colonel accused of
overseeing the slaughter of thousands of his countrymen in the
1980s, appears to demonstrate the weaknesses in the system. Ali,
who is known as ``Tuke,'' or The Crow, was deported from Canada in
1992 after a television program exposed him as a war criminal. He
then lived comfortably in the United States until 1996, when CBS
exposed him again and he returned to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long. Immigration officials said Tuke reentered the
country under an assumed name, then became a permanent resident of
the United States by marrying an American citizen. After being
tipped off by outraged Somali immigrants, the INS finally arrested
him in Virginia last year and moved to have him deported, accusing
him of concealing his involvement in ``genocidal acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Under immigration law, the INS needed the State Department to
issue a finding that genocide, not just atrocities, had occurred
under Tuke's command. The State Department refused to go that far,
so the INS attempted to deport him on grounds he had lied on an
application he had submitted for political asylum. An immigration
judge dismissed the case because Tuke had withdrawn the application
after becoming a permanent resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say he's a nice guy; we all know what he is,''
said an INS official. ``But that's not enough for us. We have to
act under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Despots take advantage
</P>
<P>
   of gaps in refugee program
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Samater said the case illustrates not only the porousness of the
US refugee program but also the inability of the immigration system
to handle such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody even addressing the central theme: that he
committed crimes against humanity,'' Samater said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration specialists said the refugee program has become
especially vulnerable to despots seeking asylum. The program is a
lifeline for tens of thousands of people who each year are
legitimately escaping persecution. The most recent example is the
exodus of hundreds of thousands of people driven from Kosovo by the
Serbian army. The United States plans to take in 20,000 refugees
from the crisis, US immigration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the screening of refugee applicants has become almost
perfunctory, according to people who administer the massive
program. The screening often takes place amid the chaos of armed
conflict, in ``places that have descended into hell,'' said Dan
Cadman, who heads the National Security Unit for the INS. Those
conditions make it difficult to verify persecution claims or to
identify specific perpetrators of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government relies on ``joint voluntary
agencies'' to perform most screening tasks. Contracted by the State
Department, the relief agencies are responsible for compiling
information to evaluate persecution claims before passing along the
files to INS officers. But the agencies are essentially refugee
advocates, lacking resources to investigate and seldom making
recommendations to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of in a delicate position; we have to be lenient,''
said Gary Remmel, head of processing in Belgrade for the
International Organization for Migration, which screened two
Bosnian refugees who were admitted into the United States, even
though the Globe later identified them as participants in ethnic
cleansing. ``We don't have the authority to be too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Remmel said many applications passed on to the INS are difficult
to support. People who advocate for refugees ``sometimes don't
realize the amount of weak claims you see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Remmel said he was unfamiliar with the two cases investigated by
the Globe. However, with few safeguards and a crush of
applications, he said: ``It's no surprise that people get in who
shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   INS officers are responsible for investigating the background of
applicants, but people involved in the process said the refugee
program has become so large it is difficult to do more than a basic
40-minute interview, particularly during a crisis. During the war
in Bosnia, each INS officer conducted roughly a dozen such
interviews a day, according to Karen McCoy, an INS officer who was
part of the program.

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ WARNING! Your shampoo may be hazardous to your
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Many women and men have trouble with their hair. And the
problems can be due to their shampoo and conditioner, said Brenda
Fields, director of admissions at Vogue College of Cosmetology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be overshampooing, undershampooing or
overconditioning, which really weighs the hair down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors in the cosmetology field agree that using
professional products is always best. But when that's not an
option, how do women sift through the sea of non-salon shampoos and
conditioners (not to mention styling products) to find the best
products for their hair?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is going to be trial and error,'' said Laura Hays,
a cosmetology instructor at McLennan Community College.
</P>
<P>
   If she had to pick the best store-bought shampoos (or
over-the-counter shampoos as stylists call them), she said she
would go with those that at one point were professional shampoos,
like Clairol products or Vidal Sassoon. Hays would shy away from
products that have big names backing them but have never been
professional products _ products like Neutrogena and Pantene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some you're paying for the name and some of them are full of
wax,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She advises women to keep in mind that ``you get what you pay
for'' when it comes to cheaper shampoos like Flex and Suave.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Gordon, director of education at Vogue, said shampoo and
hair products have come a long way in the 35 years she's been in
the hair business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazingly they've come out with a lot of great products, not
just in the professional business but in the over-the-counter
products,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite over-the-counter lines is the Aussie brand,
which originated in Australia. She also likes Pantene. Fields has
used and likes L'Oreal's Color-Vive products. Both women say the
Infusium line is one of the best store-bought shampoos for your
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infusium has every kind of ingredient your hair needs,''
Gordon said. ``The leave-in treatment is good, especially in the
summertime for those out in the sun a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to narrow down the choices of shampoos is to look for
shampoos specifically for your hair type. For instance, for oily
hair use shampoos formulated for oily hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does make a difference,'' Hays said.
</P>
<P>
   Many women don't know it, but one of the most important things
about shampoo is whether it's pH balanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be as close to the hairs' pH as possible,'' Hays
said.
</P>
<P>
   A good pH for a shampoo is in the 4.5 to 5.5 range, Hays said,
while Fields and Gordon said anything from 5.5 to 7.5 is normal and
that anything higher would be extremely alkaline.
</P>
<P>
   Most shampoos don't list their pH number, but you can test it
yourself with litmus paper strips, which can be purchased at beauty
supply stores or pharmacies. When dipped in shampoo, the strips
indicate what the pH is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a shampoo is real high in alkalinity, it will leave your
hair dry and brittle,'' Fields said. ``Baby shampoos used to be the
highest in alkaline. I think they've changed a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Prell and Pert are very high in alkaline, Gordon reported.
</P>
<P>
   The shampoos that are high in alkaline often make the hair look
and feel great for a couple of weeks before fizzling out, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, Fields and Hays agree that shampoos like Pert and Prell
that tout ``thicker, fuller'' hair actually open up the hair's
cuticle to plump the hair. But after months of use, hair usually
has dull buildup and becomes unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
   Hays says people should be leery of promotional advertisements
for hair products and unscientific surveys.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was astounded to see a survey on a TV investigative
report that put about 20 shampoos to the test. Women shampooed with
the products for about three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women picked Pert, saying it left their hair really full
and bouncy, but where the problems lie is after about about three
to six months of use,'' Hays said. ``The show left the public
thinking Pert was the best shampoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a woman finds a couple of good shampoos and conditioners,
it's a good idea to alternate them about every two weeks to give
your hair a break, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never stick with the same shampoo,'' she said. ``You've got to
rotate.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to strip off the buildup on the hair at
least once a week, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for your hair, especially if you use a lot
of mousses and things,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   To test for buildup, stretch out a lock of hair and scrape the
open edge of a sharp pair of scissors back and forth on the hair.
The white flakes that pop up are what has built-up on the hair.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon doesn't trust many of the ``clarifying shampoos'' to do
the job of taking off the buildup. Some may not only take off the
buildup, but color and perms, too. Baking soda will do the job
better, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take plain baking soda from the kitchen and mix it in your
hand with some shampoo and just work that with the shampoo,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   TIPS ON GETTING HAIR BACK INTO SHAPE
</P>
<P>
   _ For dry, brittle hair: Try cutting back on the amount of
shampoo you use if you wash your hair every day. Use a conditioning
shampoo. Try a leave-in treatment like Infusium 23, concentrating
on the ends.
</P>
<P>
   Be weary of overconditioning the hair and using waxy ingredients
like oils and cholesterol, which weigh the hair down. Use
alcohol-free styling products.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating all or some of the heat you style your hair with is
key to getting dry hair back on track. Of course, that's not always
possible, so experiment with a couple of the above tips to see
wha-- , if anything, works. n For thick, course hair: Naturally
curly hair tends to dry out faster than any other type of hair,
says Pat Gordon of Vogue College of Cosmetology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be using a leave-in conditioner all summer,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Use products specifically formulated f-- r dry, damaged hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ For colored or permed hair: Using a good shampoo and
conditioner on permed and colored hair is a key to keeping a perm
from falling out and color from fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shampoos will shorten the life of a perm and you need to watch
that,'' said Vogue's Brenda Fields. ``A lot of (salons) will not
guarantee their perms because if you go home and use something like
Suave or Prell or Head and Shoulders, it will strip that perm out.
Like that shampoo Perma Soft that was so popular several years ago.
I had more customers whose perms didn't hold and they'd come back
and blame me. They were using Perma Soft. It was making the hair so
soft, it -- as overconditioned.''
</P>
<P>
   _ For fine, fly-away hair: The center of the hair, called the
medulla, usually isn't formed completely in fine hair _ the same
reason a lot of children's hair won't hold a perm, Gordon said.
Always use products for fine hair, but shy away from shampoos that
tout things like ``fuller, thicker, bouncy'' hair, like Pert, she
advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy hair, without a lot of chemicals, probably could stand
it for a while, but overall, it's going to damage it,'' Gordon
said. ``It roughens it up and that's what makes it feel thicker and
more volumnized.'' It also could stri-- color-treated hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ For flakes and dandruff: Some shampoos will dry out hair and
activate dandruff. Ask your hairdresser or doctor about suggested
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   _ For oily hair: It's important to use a shampoo formulated for
oily hair. Concentrate the shampoo more on the roots than on the
ends of the hair. Use a light conditioner that contains no wax or
coating ingredients that willweigh the hair down.
</P>
<P>
   _ For men's hair: Men can use the same shampoo women do because
they have the same scalp and the same hair. Men should try to cut
back on the amount of shampoo they use because it could be drying
their hair and scalp. Try mixing a few drops of shampoo with a few
drops of water in your hand before shampooing. Men need to
condition their hair, especially if spending a lot of time in the
sun or if they use a blow-dryer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men need to condition, but maybe not quite as often as women,
but they need the whole treatment,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   And men, stop grabbing that bar of soap to wash your hair!

 &HT;    While NRA show carried on, father lead gripping procession
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ To hear Charlton Heston say it, you'd think the
National Rifle Association was just in Denver on Saturday to pay
its respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same right to be here, to shoulder the grief, to
share our sorrow,'' he said, an eagle over his shoulder with rifles
in its talons. Good grief.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters outside the hotel while Heston spoke preferred that
he send regards from afar. But surely the Denverites understand.
The NRA has membership drives to run, souvenirs to sell, campaign
caches to amass, political enemies to target.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's presence did one good thing. It brought out a peaceful
army that gathered at the state Capitol and walked in procession to
the hotel five blocks away, gaining people all the way. It circled
the hotel before heading back. One marcher at the front was stunned
at the numbers. When the front end of the line returned to the
Capitol, ``we met up with the other end of the line.'' That's
12,000 people _ a half-mile of disgust.
</P>
<P>
   At the front was Tom Mauser, holding a sign with a fresh young
face on it and the words: ``My son Daniel died at Columbine. He'd
expect me to be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauser since has been on morning news programs, pointing out
what a poor job we do keeping guns out of the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know about the loopholes in the Brady Law? This is not a
rhetorical question. It's one that Daniel Mauser asked his father
one day after school. Tom Mauser didn't know. His son filled him
in.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loophole: Though federally licensed gun merchants
must perform background checks for sales, those who aren't licensed
_ about half of all gun-show vendors _ don't. That makes gun shows
attractive for felons and people trying to stay one step ahead of
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Gun shows were a favorite haunt of David Koresh and followers as
they amassed the arsenal that led to the tragic standoff near Waco,
Texas in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe three of the guns used in the massacre
were purchased by a girlfriend of one of the Columbine shooters at
the Tanner Gun Show. The other gun, a semiautomatic TEC-DC9,
appears also to have had gun-show lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not these sales were legal, it appears the show takes
few provisions to guarantee that its sales are.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, to demonstrate the ease of purchasing an assault
weapon, staffers of Congresswoman Diana DeGette, D-Denver, went to
the Tanner Gun Show and purchased an SKS rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't ask for ID. They didn't ask for anything,''
DeGette told the Denver Post. ``They sold it for $200 cash, no
questions asked.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the type of profligate end run on gun laws that
President Clinton wants to end with background checks for all sales
at gun shows, not just from licensed dealers. Legislation of that
sort has run aground in the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, quickly becoming a master of evasion, said
he supports closing the loopholes as proposed, but won't push
reviving the bill in Austin _ too late in the session, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady Law is nothing more than a provision to better enforce
gun laws already on the books. The NRA continuously says that the
federal government doesn't do a good enough job enforcing the laws
it already has. Daniel Mauser could have shown the NRA how.
</P>
<P>
   I agree with those who say that simply looking at firearms is an
act of delusion. The ingredients of the Columbine tragedy are
layered and all-encompassing _ every social nightmare rolled into
one. But among those layers is America's gun culture, a cult of
convenience even for lawbreakers, a cult of commerce that puts the
customer first.
</P>
<P>
   Heston blamed the media and people with political motives for
stirring up crowds such as the one outside his hotel. What an
insult to Mr. Mauser. He has no political agenda. Neither did his
son _ no souvenirs to sell, no lawmakers to buy.

 &HT;    Index fund approach gains momentum
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someday soon, the gigantic, hallowed Fidelity Magellan fund may
not be the biggest mutual fund in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The amounts involved are staggering: Magellan, $90.77 billion;
Vanguard Index 500, $82.52 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There are other surprises:
</P>
<P>
   _ The challenger is, of all things, an index fund. You know, one
of those stodgy outfits that aim to be average, or as close as they
can get.
</P>
<P>
   _ Magellan has something of a handicap, since it closed to new
investors 17 months ago. But the fund has grown by more than $20
billion since then. How could that be? Retirement accounts continue
to pour in money every month, and the rising stock market has
driven the total value up nearly every month.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Bogle Sr., who sired the Index 500 fund and spent most of
his career pitching it to individual investors, no longer puts his
own new investments into the fund. He holds on to Index 500 shares
he already owns, but his choice for new money is a Vanguard fund
based on the much broader Wilshire 5,000-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, these two indexes should perform quite
similarly,'' Bogle said. ``I just think that owning the entire
market should be the basic approach in indexing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Index 500 fund does move into first place, it will be a
triumph of Bogle's passive approach over Peter Lynch's aggressive,
stock-picking techniques. Lynch was extraordinarily successful in
the years he made the Magellan fund famous.
</P>
<P>
   An index fund is a sloth by comparison, attempting to mimic the
performance of a given stock market index by buying and holding all
the stocks in the selected index. The theory is that stocks, and
the underlying indexes, generally go up over long periods. Thus,
long-term investors can go along for a worry-free ride by buying an
index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Active investors sneer at that rationale. They ask, ``Why try to
be no better than average?''
</P>
<P>
   One answer is that index funds are low-cost investments,
compared with other mutual funds. That means a relatively small
percentage of investors' money gets siphoned off to pay operating
and trading expenses. Another cost factor: Index funds don't buy
and sell very often, so they don't generate lots of tax
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds also remove one element of investment risk. They
still have market risk, meaning they will go down if the stock
market does. But they don't expose investors to the risk that the
manager will pick the wrong stocks. That happens frequently with
hotshot fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the factor that explains why many institutional
investors, such as the big pension funds, started indexing years
ago with at least a portion of their portfolios: They never have to
explain why they picked crummy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason many individuals have picked index funds in
recent years is that the returns have been outstanding. The S&AMP;P 500
index has risen dramatically, and so have index funds that track
them.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the Index 500 fund has given investors a 26.6
percent return, on average, over the last five years. That beats
the returns of 95 percent of similar stock mutual funds, according
to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago-based mutual fund researcher.
</P>
<P>
   This will not go on forever. Many people believe Vanguard Index
500 will lose investors the next time the market falls back. ``Much
of that money is not there because these are true converts to
indexing,'' said Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of the No-Load Fund
Investor newsletter. ``It's because the fund is doing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jacobs has been increasing the percentage of
index funds in the sample portfolios he recommends in the
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The index funds are really for long-term investors,'' he
explained. ``If you get a year or two of underperformance, it's not
the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to look into indexing, there are a number of
choices. Among the fund groups that offer an S&AMP;P 500 mutual fund
are Fidelity (800-544-8888), Schwab (800-435-4000), T. Rowe Price
(800-638-5660), USAA (800-382-8722) and Vanguard (800-662-7447).
</P>
<P>
   For a Wilshire 5000 fund, check out Vanguard or Wilshire
(888-200-6796).
</P>
<P>
   Is indexing the right method for everybody, all the time? No.
But it's worth considering, especially for those who plan to leave
the money alone for many years. You can get arguments both for and
against. Remember what Mark Twain said: ``It's a difference of
opinion that makes horse races.''

 &HT;    Shaver goes Electric
 &HT;    By Carl Hoover
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Billy Joe Shaver has a ready quip for those
wondering about the title of his new album Electric Shaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my boy was born in Waco, I tried to name him that, but
wouldn't nobody go for it,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The joke within his joke is that between Shaver and his son
Eddie, Electric Shaver really could be named after Eddie, whose
blistering guitar work powers the album, energizing the rough-hewn
beauty in the senior Shaver's lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   The two Shavers and their backing band perform as Shaver,
generally a foursome when they're on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Shaver split his childhood between Corsicana and Waco and
considers the latter his home. He spends his downtime in a home
outside Waco, although he prefers to keep its location close to his
vest to maintain a modicum of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   While he and Eddie performed for a ``Texas Music Cafe'' taping
late last month, it's unusual that Shaver plays publicly in the
Waco area. The reason? The money's not there for a musician to pay
the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pay hasn't been that good,'' he explained. ``It's a
strange market. It's my hometown, too, but we don't play around
here much.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he, Eddie and their band will support their new CD with
shows in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, San
Antonio, Austin and the like.
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up to Victory, his gospel-themed release on New West
Records, Electric Shaver brings Shaver and his son back to the
sound of Tramp On My Street, the 1993 album that put the
singer-songwriter back on the map, although not the map of
mainstream country.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Kennedy, who produced several albums for country
roots-rocker Steve Earle, shepherded Electric Shaver, and Shaver
says he's proud of the result.
</P>
<P>
   From the wailing initial note of Eddie's electric guitar to the
bluegrass flavor of ``She Can Dance,'' Electric Shaver offers odes
to the ordinary (the cheap booze of ``Thunderbird''); love songs to
Brenda, the love of his life who's fought cancer for more than a
year (``She Can Dance,'' ``I'll Be Here''); practical advice (``Try
and Try Again,'' with Shaver improvising as a shouting gospel
preacher); and humor (``People and Their Problems'').
</P>
<P>
   The latter shows Shaver's knack for summing up people and
situations in everyday language that's dead on target:
</P>
<P>
   My sister's kid is tatooed from his head down to his toes.
</P>
<P>
   He claims trouble follows him everywhere he goes.
</P>
<P>
   He's such a lazy, loafing, good for nothing drunken slob.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he still thinks I oughter give his sorry a-- a job.
</P>
<P>
   People and their problems are giving me a pain.
</P>
<P>
   People and their problems are messing with my brain.
</P>
<P>
   I try to help them solve them, but they always stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   People and their problems are driving me insane.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that one doesn't hear much of Shaver's work on
country radio, although he's found a friend in the Americana music
format. Americana's affinity for roots music with an edge and grit
reminds Shaver of another musical movement two decades earlier, a
counter-Nashville one led by Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson,
Jerry Jeff Walker, their colleagues and a young man from Central
Texas who penned songs like ``Honky Tonk Heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just turns over, just like leaves,'' he says today.
</P>
<P>
   Shaver's songs married with son Eddie's crowd-pleasing guitar
style has found a home in the Americana niche where roots-rockers,
alternative country and neo-folk music find audiences and exposure.
Rolling Stone, CD Review and The Village Voice all put Shaver's
Tramp On My Street on their year's best albums lists, while
customers for the Internet book and music store Amazon.com tabbed
Victory the best country CD of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Early response to songs from Electric Shaver has confirmed
Shaver's pride in the new album. ``I like the balance of this one .
. . Young people enjoy it a lot and the older people seem to
tolerate it, so I guess it's OK,'' he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Joe and Eddie will spend much of the immediate future
touring in support of their album, and Billy Joe notes he's working
on songs for its successor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he acknowledges that his son's musical talent
has drawn the attention of some notable rock musicians interested
in signing him to their touring bands.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if Eddie decides to pack up and join another
band? Shaver paused. ``Punt, I guess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaver knows enough about fame's roller coaster ride and the mix
of good and bad his own career has seen to place his pride in
quality of work, not the week-to-week travels a song may take on
the charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy doing what I do and I sleep well,'' he summed up.

   McCoy said most officers make their decisions immediately after
the interview. She said approval rates during the war in Bosnia
were probably ``about 99.9 percent'' because of the urgency of the
crisis. ``You have to keep in mind, these are not adversarial
relationships; you're not like an inspector at the point of
entry,'' she said. ``You're helping them to make a claim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say based on the system we have, it is likely that
someone could slip through very easily,'' she said. ``If they're
very careful and there's nothing to raise the suspicion of the
officers, they could easily lie their way through the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Human rights offenders
</P>
<P>
   slipped in with refugees
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, participants in bloody ethnic cleansing operations
apparently slipped into the US among 83,247 Bosnian refugees
admitted between 1993-98. The Globe has identified two refugees in
New England and another in North Dakota who allegedly participated
in Serb operations in the early 1990s in northwestern Bosnia. A
Bosnian Serb refugee in Atlanta has been accused in a civil suit of
torturing prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Darko Maricic, a Serb journalist in the city of Prijedor, where
two of the refugees are from, said it was common for Serb
combatants to conceal their pasts from US immigration officials.
``They often lied in the embassies. I personally know a couple
people who lied,'' Maricic said. ``It was the only way to get into
the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Some refugee specialists believe the occasional admission of
human rights offenders may be worth it in the overall scheme. ``If
one out of every thousand cases might be less than pure, maybe
that's the price you have to pay,'' said Robert Carey, vice
president of resettlement for the International Rescue Committee, a
relief organization. ``I mean, how many thousands of lives have you
saved in the process?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the refugee process isn't to blame. The cases of
Haitian military officers who entered the United States following
the 1994 invasion shows how a despot with well-placed friends can
enter the country just as easily as a refugee. The most glaring
example is Emmanuel ``Toto'' Constant, who headed the Haitian death
squad FRAPH before the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   When US troops entered FRAPH's headquarters, they reportedly
found trophy photos of tortured and mutilated victims on the walls.
Constant made his way to Puerto Rico, then to New York on a
multiple-entry visa that apparently had been issued by an official
in the US consulate in Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Once detected by human rights groups, Constant's presence in New
York caused great controversy. But when the State Department moved
to revoke his visa and the INS arrested him and initiated
deportation proceedings, he filed a lawsuit, signaling his intent
to go public with the details of his longstanding relationship with
the Central Intelligence Agency. After negotiations, the State
Department stayed his deportation order, and he dropped the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The US government ``isn't about to give up what I would call
imperial sovereignty: the belief that they can do whatever they
want to do'' on foreign territory, said Michael Ratner, whose
organization, the Center for Constitutional Rights, has brought
suits against several alleged war criminals, including Constant.
</P>
<P>
   Many activists believe that the government is hesitant to
aggressively pursue human rights offenders because it would force
the United States to confront its own alliances with repressive
regimes, especially during the Cold War. The United States has been
tentative in its support of Spain's efforts to prosecute former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who ruled his nation with an
iron fist after assuming power in a CIA-sponsored coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of how to deal with human rights offenders makes many
immigration specialists uneasy, creating fears that any attempt to
fill in the cracks will only make it harder for people with
legitimate persecution claims. As a result, many people have begun
to focus on tracking them down once they settle in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But, except for OSI, the avenues for pursuing human rights
offenders have been few. US law allows victims to file civil suits
against their assailants. Legal advocates have employed the Alien
Tort Claims Act, an obscure 1789 law originally designed to
prosecute pirates, and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1992 to
bring suits against some alleged perpetrators, but the victories
have been symbolic: uncollectible financial awards against people
who have already left the country.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates like the Center for Justice and Accountability, a San
Francisco-based organization funded by Amnesty International, have
been pushing US immigration officials to move harder against people
suspected of human rights crimes. But Shawn Roberts, chief legal
counsel for the group, said US officials have responded
half-heartedly. She said a real commitment may require the kind of
lobbying effort mounted by Jewish groups that pushed the Justice
Department to create OSI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing they've entered into dialogue,'' Roberts
said, shortly after a recent meeting in Washington with US
immigration officials. ``But we'd like to see the dialogue
complemented with some action. We haven't seen that so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have argued that, with most living Nazis reaching
old age, OSI is becoming obsolete and should be expanded to include
war criminals. ``There is a so-called biological solution and
clearly that is going to happen,'' said Rosenbaum. But he said the
unit currently has 19 cases in litigation and has no plans to
change its mandate.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials said it might take years to develop the kind of
system that has been so effective for OSI. J. Kelly Ryan, who heads
the refugee and asylum law division of the INS, said the agency
hopes eventually to compile a watch list similar to the one
developed by OSI.
</P>
<P>
   But the task of hunting down modern war criminals, officials
said, is also more difficult than tracking the Nazis: Rather than
poring over documents, investigators often must track down credible
witnesses in remote countries, in highly politicized situations
that usually don't lend themselves to an accurate recounting of
events.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they are concerned about the repercussions of
deporting war criminals who could either incite more violence in
their countries, or even be tortured or killed upon their return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want these people getting jobs at Paramount Pictures
as a CEO,'' said Ryan. ``But would it be fair to dump them back
into a country and start the killing fields again?''

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Carl Dorelien was once a small-time
dictator, and a proud one at that. He was part of a clique of
military officers who held Haiti at gunpoint until 1994, when the
junta's abuses became so grave that the Clinton administration
dispatched 20,000 troops to the tiny Caribbean nation to restore
order.
</P>
<P>
   An outspoken colonel, Dorelien had been head of personnel for
the Haitian army, which had seized power from President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. He oversaw a 7,000-man force whose
well-documented campaign of butchery included murder, rape,
kidnapping, and torture, leading to the deaths of some 5,000
Haitian civilians over three bloody years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good agreement for the United States and for
Haiti,'' President Clinton told Americans after the junta stepped
aside. ``The military leaders will leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien left, but where he went is another story. He is living
with his family in this Florida resort community, on a visa granted
him by the same government that launched a full-scale invasion and
spent $2.2 billion to removehim and his fellow officers from
power. His past has remained largely hidden, even after he made
local news in 1997 by winning a $3.2 million jackpot in the Florida
lottery. Lottery officials described him as a penniless immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview here, Dorelian spoke candidly about
his past. ``I was a member of the Haitian army high command,'' he
said, a miniature $2,500 gold bar dangling from his neck. ``I lived
like a king in my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien's case is not an isolated one. A Globe investigation
has discovered a broad range of people who have gained refuge in
the United States over the last several years despite evidence of
their involvement in serious human rights abuses. The list includes
three alleged participants of ethnic cleansing in the former
Yugoslavia, two who are living in New England; several former
henchmen of the murderous regime of Somali strongman Mohammed Siad
Barre; 15 Haitian military officers who Dorelien said joined him in
America; and a Salvadoran general accused of covering up the
massacre of four American churchwomen in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dorelien, who said he received a five-year visa from a
friendly US military officer, some entered the country with the
knowledge _ and even the assistance _ of US government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really appalling to think that the United States has
become the retirement home of choice for murderers and despots,''
said William P. Ford, a New York attorney whose sister Ita, a nun,
was killed by members of the Salvadoran National Guard in the 1980
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Cadman, chief of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's national security unit, said the agency has become
increasingly concerned about human rights offenders who have taken
refuge in the United States. Although the magnitude of the problem
is unclear, he said, it is the logical outgrowth of numerous recent
international conflicts, the historic practice of the United States
to take in persecution victims, and the difficulties of screening
the 6.5 million people issued visas to enter the country each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want, in an ideal society, even one monster in your
midst,'' said Cadman. ``The concern is deep, but that doesn't
necessarily suggest there is a widespread problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights monitors compare the problem to that of
hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of Nazis who slipped into the
United States following World War II. The phenomenon ultimately led
the Justice Department to set up a special anti-Nazi unit, a $3.7
million program described by supporters as the most effective
anti-Nazi operation in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights monitors complain that the US government has
taken the presence of other war criminals less seriously than the
Nazis despite evidence that their numbers also are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the thousands,'' said Gerald Gray, who last year
founded the San Francisco-based Center for Justice and
Accountability, a nonprofit organization funded by Amnesty
International that strives to bring violators of human rights to
justice. The group has compiled information on dozens of cases and
has filed two lawsuits: one against a Bosnian Serb refugee in
Atlanta who allegedly tortured prisoners with pipes, bats, and
other deadly objects during the war in the Balkans. The other suit
is against a former Chilean secret police officer living in Miami
despite allegations that he tortured and executed a former
government official as part of a 1973 terror campaign under General
Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who ruled Chile from 1973-90, is under house arrest
outside London, awaiting a decision on whether he can be extradited
to Spain to face prosecution for crimes against humanity and
torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're everywhere _ Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, you name
it,'' said Gray.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Human rights stance
</P>
<P>
   raises troubling issues
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem raises a number of thorny questions for the United
States at a time when the Clinton administration has made human
rights a centerpiece of its foreign policy. To varying degrees, the
issue of how people are treated by their government has played a
role in nearly every military action undertaken by the
administration, including the recent NATO bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   However, the emphasis on human rights also has forced the United
States to confront its own past, and a number of uncomfortable
alliances that were forged, often in the name of fighting communism
during the Cold War. On a March trip to Guatemala, President
Clinton apologized for US support of Guatemalan military forces who
massacred tens of thousands of unarmed Mayan Indians during a
36-year civil war, which began in 1954 with a CIA-engineered coup
against a democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Pinochet, who also came to power with CIA
assistance, has shaken international law and emboldened human
rights advocates who believe the case has set a precedent for
holding perpetrators of atrocities accountable. Pinochet, who was
immune from prosecution in Chile after being declared Senator for
Life, was arrested last October after traveling to London for
surgery on a herniated disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a wake-up call for a lot of people,'' said Reed
Brody, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch in New York. ``The
rules of business-as-usual may change.''
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear how the new rules might be applied,
particularly in the United States, where laws make it difficult to
prosecute foreigners for crimes committed abroad. Up to now, human
rights advocates have relied on an obscure 1789 law, the Alien Tort
Claims Act, and difficult-to-enforce international treaties to
prosecute foreigners accused of atrocities. Their rare victories
have been mostly symbolic, such as a $47 million judgment in 1996
by a federal judge in Boston against a Guatemalan general held
responsible for the rape and torture of an American nun and nine
others. The general, Hector A. Gramajo, was hit with the lawsuit
just before his graduation from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government. He returned to Guatemala and has paid no compensation.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of alleged human rights offenders living in the
United States reads like a rogue's gallery from the worst armed
conflicts of recent years:
</P>
<P>
   --The Globe has discovered two Bosnian refugees who settled in
New England after allegedly participating in ethnic cleansing
operations in the former Yugoslavia. They are part of a spate of
recent reports of former Serb combatants who made their way to the
United States _ apparently by exploiting a chaotic refugee crisis
similar to the one now unfolding in Kosovo, as well as serious
weaknesses in the refugee screening process. Even before Kosovo,
the Serb campaign of murder, rape, torture, and mass deportation
had created some 2 million refugees in the Balkans, including
83,247 who entered the United States between 1993-98.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service regional office in
Portland, Maine, has opened an investigation into the case of a
39-year-old Bosnian Muslim in Burlington, Vt., after the Globe
developed evidence that he had been a member of a Serb paramilitary
unit that participated in the forced removal of some 60,000 Muslims
and Croats in northwestern Bosnia. The man denies being a member of
the unit.
</P>
<P>
   The INS also is conducting an investigation into the case of
Jezdimir Topic, 56, who settled with his family in the Boston
suburb of Everett after the war. The agency opened that probe after
witnesses told the Globe that Topic had been a guard at the
notorious Trnopolje prison camp, a converted schoolhouse where
numerous cases of murder, rape, and torture reportedly occurred.
Topic, who declined to comment, has not been accused of directly
participating in the atrocities, but witnesses said he did nothing
to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials said both men could be deported if the allegations
turn out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, another former member of a Serb paramilitary unit,
Dragan Borcic, entered the country as a refugee last year and is
employed at a meat-packing plant in Bismarck, N.D. Borcic confirmed
in an interview he was a member of the paramilitary group, but
said, ``We only attacked those people who had weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   --Dorelien, the Haitian colonel, told the Globe that 15
high-ranking military officers _ the entire junta, with the
exception of supreme commander Raoul Cedras and Brigadier General
Philippe Biamby, his chief of staff _ have been allowed to
immigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dorelien, the list of former officers living in the
United States includes Major General Jean-Claude Duperval, the
regime's assistant commander-in-chief; Herbert Valmont, the head of
intelligence; and Ernst Prud'homme, a high-ranking member of the
Bureau du Informations et Coordination, a notoriously violent
propaganda unit.

their brilliance and superiority entitled them to murder anyone
they considered inferior. The year was 1924. The city was Chicago.

   HEART-EMOTIONS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ When Rollin McCraty says the
heart has its own brain, he's not suggesting the left ventricle can
calculate long division, conjugate verbs or identify colors. Those
conscious decisions are made in the gray matter within the skull.
It's the unconscious emotions that are processed in the more than
40,000 neurons of the heart. So when a car cuts us off on the
highway, it is the brain that quickly converts the sight into
instructions to hit the brakes or change lanes. And just as
quickly, the heart converts the same sight into the tense and testy
feelings we associate with fear and anger. Once we understand the
heart's physical relationship to emotions, we can use that
relationship ``to help manage emotions,'' says McCraty, research
director and institute co-founder of the Institute of HeartMath
near San Jose, Calif. With his co-founders, he has developed
techniques for changing the messages the heart sends through its
own nervous system to the rest of the body, creating the highs of
love and compassion or the unpleasant physical and mental effects
of fear, anger and other stressful emotions. (Lamb, Dayton Daily

   ``We are all here,'' said Dorelien. ``Plus, other members of the
staff at different periods of time during those three years.
Remember, all members didn't stay in the same position between
1991-94. Sometimes Cedras would change his staff. Those former
members, they are here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien said most of the former officers reside in Florida and
New York, and despite the fact that they have gained refuge,
continue to seethe over the Clinton administration's policy toward
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are watching TV and President Clinton says something
about Haiti, we smile, because he knows that he's lying, and we
know that he's lying,'' said Dorelien. ``But we don't say anything,
because we have to be careful. They accepted us here, so we have to
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   --The US government also has failed to address other
high-profile cases in which alleged perpetrators of crimes have
been allowed to reside in the United States despite protests from
victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while investigating the massacre of the churchwomen
in El Salvador, representatives of the Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights in New York discovered that Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, a
retired Salvadoran general, had been living in Florida, even though
he had been implicated in a widespread coverup of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most heinous crimes of El Salvador's 13-year civil
war, the women _ three nuns and a layworker _ were kidnapped by
members of the Salvadoran national guard, taken to a remote
location, raped, then shot to death. The case was solved only after
US authorities circumvented a widespread coverup by the Salvadoran
military and developed independent evidence against the national
guardsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Vides headed the National Guard at the time of the murders. He
appointed an internal investigator who helped the gunmen change
their weapons and personally ordered them not to confess to anyone,
according to testimony from the gunmen. In 1993, a United Nations
Truth Commission, supported and partially funded by the US
government, concluded that Vides ``knew that members of the
National Guard had committed the assassination and. . .had
facilitated the concealment of facts, obstructing the respective
judicial investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview recently at his spacious home in Palm Coast,
near Daytona Beach, Vides, 61, adamantly denied his involvement in
the coverup and said he had entered the United States by applying
for a visa through normal channels within the US consulate in San
Salvador. ``I ask myself over and over if there is anything I have
done wrong, and I can't find anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, the brother of one of the nuns, said he was sickened to
learn last year from the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights that
Vides and retired General Jose Guillermo Garcia, the Salvadoran
defense minister at the time of the murders, were both living in
Florida. ``It's just pulling a scab off a very deep wound,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said he asked the Justice Department why Vides had been
allowed to enter the country. ``The explanation is, `We're looking
into this and we'll tell you promptly.' That was in November,'' he
said. ``We have yet to hear any substantive explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Bergeron, an INS spokesman, said he could not talk about
Vides' case because of privacy restrictions. But he said the Truth
Commission's allegations about Vides' involvement in the coverup
emerged after he already had been admitted into the United States
through ``normal immigration procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, similar outrage greeted the news that Emmanuel
``Toto'' Constant, who once headed the Haitian death squad FRAPH,
has been living with his aunt in a two-story home in Queens. The
paramilitary unit headed by Constant was believed to be responsible
for some of the most gruesome crimes of the Haitian regime.
</P>
<P>
   Constant entered the country through Puerto Rico on a
multiple-entry visa often issued to officials of foreign
governments, INS officials said. In 1995, then-Secretary of State
Warren Christopher ordered that Constant's visa be revoked, noting
in a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno that Constant's
``presence and activities in the United States seriously undermine.
. .compelling foreign policy objectives'' and gives the impression
``that the United States is permitting Mr. Constant to use the
United States as a base of operation for FRAPH.''
</P>
<P>
   An immigration judge issued a deportation order against
Constant, but the State Department later balked, saying that his
presence in Haiti could destabilize the government. The INS, which
had taken Constant into custody, released him after determining
that he did not present a threat to public safety in the United
States. In a highly unusual resolution last year, the New York City
Council called the government's refusal to extradite Constant
``unconscionable'' and said his presence ``can have dire
consequences for the City of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to contact Constant were unsuccessful, but sources in
the Haitian community said he recently tried to enhance his image
by offering $7,000 to a prestigious Masonic order in Brooklyn in an
unsuccessful effort to gain membership.
</P>
<P>
   Dorelian's story appears to offer the first evidence that US
military officials issued visas to Haitian military leaders, even
as US troops were expelling them from power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dorelien, he requested his visa on Oct. 26, 1994,
just before Aristide, who had been restored to power by US troops,
sent him into exile in Spain. He said he told the US military
attache, Lieutenant Colonel Steven Lovasz, that he didn't want to
leave Haiti without a US visa. He said Lovasz took his passport,
then returned to Dorelien's home later that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knocked on my door and he said, `Colonel, I don't come to
see you. Where is your wife, Mrs. Dorelien?' '' Dorelien recalled.
``I called her, and we had a glass of wine together while my wife
got dressed. She came down and (Lovasz) stood up and said, `Mrs.
Dorelien, during these three years, your husband gave us all kinds
of trouble. But he is one of the Haitian officers that the US
officers respect, because he always told the truth. And that's why
we decided to give him a US visa for five years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to his family, Lovasz has retired from the military
and is working in security operations on a project for the Exxon
Corp. in Cameroon. Attempts to reach him were unsuccessful.
Bergeron said the INS could not comment on Dorelien's case because
of privacy restrictions.

   Before the coup to overthrow Aristide in 1991, Dorelien had
commanded a base where the Haitian army kept most of its tanks,
sources in Haiti said. He was regarded as instrumental to the
success of the coup, and was rewarded with a position as assistant
chief of staff to Philippe Biamby, heading all personnel decisions
for the Haitian army.
</P>
<P>
   As Dorelien describes it, his $3.2 million lottery jackpot was
actually a step down. In Haiti, he said he didn't quite live in a
house. ``My house in Haiti is a palace,'' he exclaimed, laughing.

   Dorelien justified the coup by suggesting that Haitians, who
elected Aristide overwhelmingly, were not educated enough to elect
a president. ``If someone doesn't know how to read, or to choose,
how can you talk about democracy?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to numerous human rights reports, he denied that the
Haitian military slaughtered its perceived opponents. He claimed
that US officials had paid people to steal corpses from local
morgues, then lay the bodies in the street and shot them to make it
appear that they had been murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien recalled participating in the dramatic eleventh-hour
negotiations with former President Carter, retired General Colin
Powell, and former Senator Sam Nunn that finally led the junta to
step down. At one point, he said he hesitated to shake hands with
Carter because he did not want to touch a hand that had come in
contact with Aristide, whom he described as ``the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `President Carter, before coming here, did you shake
hands with Aristide?' '' Dorelien recalled. ``I was surprised when
he said, `No, why?' I said, `If you shook hands with him, his bad
spirit would still be on you, and you could never (get it off).' I
don't know what you believe, but that is what we call Haitian
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorelien acknowledged that many bad things had been said about
the Haitian military, but he said that he was neither corrupt nor
violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I am clean,'' he said. ``If I wasn't clean, I
wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have the respect that I have from
people from the Pentagon, from people of the State Department.''

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Children younger than 14 are three times more
likely to be killed or seriously injured by hepatitis B vaccines
than to catch the disease, the Association of American Physicians
and Surgeons said in opposing Ohio's mandate that children entering
kindergarten this fall must begin receiving three doses of the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gratified that a physicians' group is courageous enough to
finally speak up,'' said Kristine M. Severyn, a pharmacist with a
Ph.D. that involved the composition and physical effects of drugs.
As director of Ohio Parents for Vaccine Safety, Severyn already had
given the Health, Retirement and Aging Committee letters opposing
the mandate from 24 individual physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association and the American Academy of
Pediatrics have endorsed the vaccine, but Severyn and the AAPS
expressed concern about the organizations' financial ties to
vaccine manufacturers. Severyn has a thank-you letter from the AAP
for a $100,000 donation in 1988 from Merck &AMP; Co., which
manufacturers vaccines for hepatitis B and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The AAPS statistics came from the federal National Vaccine
Information Center's last tabulated year, 1996, when there were 872
``serious adverse events'' and 48 deaths associated with hepatitis
B vaccinations of children younger than 14, compared with 279 cases
of hepatitis B in that age group. ``Serious'' was defined as
requiring an emergency room visit or hospital stay, or causing
death or life-threatening or disabling injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, government health officials cavalierly dismiss
reports of serious adverse vaccine effects as coincidental,'' said
Dr. Jane M. Orient, AAPS executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Virginia Haller, chief of the Ohio Department of Health's
family and community health division, calls the vaccine's risks
slim and vaccines in general ``the No. 1 accomplishment in the
effort to improve the health and well-being of U.S. citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis B is not spread by casual contact. The U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention recommends targeting the vaccine
to people with the disease's distinct risk factors: multiple sex
partners, injection-drug use, frequent occupational exposure to
blood and transmission at birth from an infected mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's mandatory hepatitis B vaccine was tacked onto a hazardous
waste bill last year without debate. The AAPS said no Ohio school
has reported hepatitis B transmission.
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A new laparoscopic procedure could help many of
the 41,000 Americans waiting for kidney transplants by making it
more practical for living relatives to donate a kidney, say doctors
who performed the operations at The University Hospital in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional operation is safe and reimbursed by insurance,
but would require an incision which nearly cuts the patient's body
in half. A 12- to-18-inch incision goes from the belly button
toward the spine, where a rib often must be removed to take out the
kidney. The recipient's operation, with the new kidney placed in
the abdomen, is much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Laparoscopy requires just a 3-inch incision just above the belly
button for removing the kidney, plus four holes of less than half
an inch along the ribcage for inserting miniature surgical tools
and a tiny camera to guide the surgeon. The donor watches a video
monitor to detach the kidney, and then it is pulled out through the
abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Laparoscopy evolved during the 1980s from arthroscopic joint
surgery, the first use of camera-guided miniature surgical tools.
Gynecologists used the scopes for examinations and by the late
'80s, surgeons used them for the relatively simple chore of
removing gall bladders. ``Sort of like picking a cherry off a
tree,'' Whiting said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins Medical School in
Baltimore pioneered laparoscopic kidney removal. Only the Maryland
hospitals and Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York have done more
than 100, with another 12 to 20 starting in the past several
months.

   ATLANTA _ Every morning by 5:10, Atlanta's pollen patrol peers
through a microscope at hundreds of pink circular blobs. Then they
sort and count: one pine, two pine, three pine; one oak, two oak;
one ash; one sweet gum.
</P>
<P>
   How those numbers add up will make or break the day for hundreds
of thousands of allergy sufferers in the Atlanta area. The numbers
represent how thick with tree, grass and weed pollen our local air
is.
</P>
<P>
   LaWanda Day, Marie McFalls and Pam Griggs are the pollen
counters for the Atlanta Asthma &AMP; Allergy Clinic, which posts the
information daily on its pollen hotline. While this is the only
official pollen collection site in metro Atlanta, the readings
represent pollen concentrations from Cartersville to Covington.
</P>
<P>
   The more blobs on the slender glass rod under the microscope,
the higher the pollen count. Each pink spot represents a particular
pollen from a tree, grass or weed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one that resembles Mickey Mouse ears is pine,'' Day
explained, peering into the 40-power microscope. ``We have to come
up with descriptions we can easily remember. Cedar is like a circle
with a star in the middle of it. Elm we think of as having a circle
within a circle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know pollen travels hundreds of miles, from sailors being
affected while out on ships,'' said Dr. Bob Berkowitz, research
director for the Atlanta Asthma &AMP; Allergy Clinic. ``Even if we
blacktopped all of Georgia, we would still get Alabama pollen.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Marietta clinic, pollen is collected in a wooden box on a
second-story roof. Inside the box is a slender, inch-long glass
spindle nestled inside a narrow metal holder.
</P>
<P>
   One side of the tube is covered with silicone grease, to which
pollen particles stick. After the sample is collected every
morning, another tube is inserted and the box is put back into
place on the roof. To get an accurate reading, the collector must
spin for 30 seconds every 10 minutes, or 72 minutes out of every 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spinning time can be critical during peak season,''
McFalls said. ``It must be carefully timed for accurate sampling.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day and night of exposure to the air, the spindle is
covered with a dusty fuzz. To identify the pollen under a
microscope, the glassware is streaked with a pink stain that picks
up the proteins of each distinct pollen grain. The count begins
from one end of the spindle and ends at the other. After one-third
of the surface is counted, a mathematical formula tabulates the
total count.
</P>
<P>
   Wind-blown pollen is how trees spread their male seed but the
pollen counters say they don't think about their livelihood in
terms of nature, science or propagation.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Understanding the pulse of emotions
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When Rollin McCraty says the heart has its own
brain, he's not suggesting the left ventricle can calculate long
division, conjugate verbs or identify colors.
</P>
<P>
   Those conscious decisions are made in the gray matter within the
skull. It's the unconscious emotions that are processed in the more
than 40,000 neurons of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   So when a car cuts us off on the highway, it is the brain that
quickly converts the sight into instructions to hit the brakes or
change lanes. And just as quickly, the heart converts the same
sight into the tense and testy feelings we associate with fear and
anger.
</P>
<P>
   Once we understand the heart's physical relationship to
emotions, we can use that relationship ``to help manage emotions,''
says McCraty, research director and institute co-founder of the
Institute of HeartMath near San Jose, Calif. With his co-founders,
he has developed techniques for changing the messages the heart
sends through its own nervous system to the rest of the body,
creating the highs of love and compassion or the unpleasant
physical and mental effects of fear, anger and other stressful
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The approach takes advantage of growing evidence that emotions
can affect thoughts instead of only the other way around, as has
been traditionally believed. HeartMath researchers, lacking medical
backgrounds and challenging mainstream philosophies, have raised
some eyebrows and voices among critics, but also have been
published in The American Journal of Cardiology and have assembled
an international advisory board of doctors in various specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Their techniques are the cornerstone of The HeartMath Solution
(HarperCollins, $24), which McCraty will present from 7 to 8 p.m.
Wednesday at Borders Books, Music &AMP; Cafe, 2040
Miamisburg-Centerville Road., Miami Twp. It was written by
co-founders Doc Childre and Howard Martin with Donna Beech.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between emotional states and heart physiology
traces its roots to Yellow Springs, where John and Beatrice Lacey
studied it through the 1960s at the Fels Research Institute, now
part of the Wright State University School of Medicine, with a
focus on changes in body shapes.
</P>
<P>
   They called the heart's communication pathways to the brain
``the key to the understanding'' of what is now called the
mind-body connection, and advocated the cardiovascular system as an
important area of psychiatric study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Laceys are legends now,'' McCraty says, and their research
is still valuable more than 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's relatively new,'' he says, ``is how complex the nervous
system in the heart is, and that it can and does function
independently of the central nervous system. It can beat on its own
without any connection to the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart rates are always changing in a healthy heart, McCraty
says. When we experience pleasant emotions such as appreciation,
those changes are consistently rhythmic enough to dance to,
yielding a graph of smooth peaks and valleys. But during
frustration or insecurity, the graph is erratic and jagged, a
pattern that interferes with the heart's messages to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't think as clearly,'' McCraty says. ``Which is one
reason when we get angry, we tend to say things we later regret.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a fine response to prehistoric stresses that were
pretty much limited to large, hungry animals, devastating weather
or other humans with spears. That reaction of the brain to
emotional stressors is the fight-or-flight response, named for the
only prehistoric options to danger. It accelerates the heart,
breath and hormonal rates that are needed for strength and speed,
and it shuts down everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting and fleeing don't apply very well to the modern
stressors of rude retailers, unreasonable bosses, crying children
and empty checkbooks. That is why we have stress-management
programs, although McCraty says they still aren't prevalent in
corporate cultures that generate the most stress.
</P>
<P>
   The programs available for managing stress typically feature
either meditation or exercise, he says. Both approaches are aimed
at the brain's fight-or-flight response, raising the threshold
before it becomes disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're helpful, but they really don't get at the source of
the stress,'' McCraty says. That source begins with ``how we're
perceiving the events in our life,'' and proceeds to which emotions
the perceptions trigger and which heart patterns the emotions
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ultimately shift our perceptions,'' he says. ``The
same events are going to happen. We're not going to stop the
traffic jams. But we can modify how we're perceiving them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the HeartMath techniques, called Freeze-Frame, can be
used ``in the middle of a staff meeting or while you're talking to
someone on the phone,'' McCraty says. While meditation works at
preventing emotions from going out of control under stress, the
HeartMath team wanted to develop easy techniques that could be used
in the moment of stress _ more of a drive-through solution for a
drive-through world.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze-Frame begins with recognizing the stress and shifting the
focus away from the problem, toward the heart for at least 10
seconds. Then recall a happy moment _ of friendship, recognition or
enjoyable activity, for example _ and try to experience it again.
The idea is to learn how to create feelings of love or appreciation
that override the jagged heart rhythms of instinctive frustration
or anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart has a type of intelligence that's not cognitive,''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Understanding the pulse of emotions
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When Rollin McCraty says the heart has its own
brain, he's not suggesting the left ventricle can calculate long
division, conjugate verbs or identify colors.
</P>
<P>
   Those conscious decisions are made in the gray matter within the
skull. It's the unconscious emotions that are processed in the more
than 40,000 neurons of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   So when a car cuts us off on the highway, it is the brain that
quickly converts the sight into instructions to hit the brakes or
change lanes. And just as quickly, the heart converts the same
sight into the tense and testy feelings we associate with fear and
anger.
</P>
<P>
   Once we understand the heart's physical relationship to
emotions, we can use that relationship ``to help manage emotions,''
says McCraty, research director and institute co-founder of the
Institute of HeartMath near San Jose, Calif. With his co-founders,
he has developed techniques for changing the messages the heart
sends through its own nervous system to the rest of the body,
creating the highs of love and compassion or the unpleasant
physical and mental effects of fear, anger and other stressful
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The approach takes advantage of growing evidence that emotions
can affect thoughts instead of only the other way around, as has
been traditionally believed. HeartMath researchers, lacking medical
backgrounds and challenging mainstream philosophies, have raised
some eyebrows and voices among critics, but also have been
published in The American Journal of Cardiology and have assembled
an international advisory board of doctors in various specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Their techniques are the cornerstone of The HeartMath Solution
(HarperCollins, $24), which McCraty will present from 7 to 8 p.m.
Wednesday at Borders Books, Music &AMP; Cafe, 2040
Miamisburg-Centerville Road., Miami Twp. It was written by
co-founders Doc Childre and Howard Martin with Donna Beech.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between emotional states and heart physiology
traces its roots to Yellow Springs, where John and Beatrice Lacey
studied it through the 1960s at the Fels Research Institute, now
part of the Wright State University School of Medicine, with a
focus on changes in body shapes.
</P>
<P>
   They called the heart's communication pathways to the brain
``the key to the understanding'' of what is now called the
mind-body connection, and advocated the cardiovascular system as an
important area of psychiatric study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Laceys are legends now,'' McCraty says, and their research
is still valuable more than 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's relatively new,'' he says, ``is how complex the nervous
system in the heart is, and that it can and does function
independently of the central nervous system. It can beat on its own
without any connection to the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart rates are always changing in a healthy heart, McCraty
says. When we experience pleasant emotions such as appreciation,
those changes are consistently rhythmic enough to dance to,
yielding a graph of smooth peaks and valleys. But during
frustration or insecurity, the graph is erratic and jagged, a
pattern that interferes with the heart's messages to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't think as clearly,'' McCraty says. ``Which is one
reason when we get angry, we tend to say things we later regret.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a fine response to prehistoric stresses that were
pretty much limited to large, hungry animals, devastating weather
or other humans with spears. That reaction of the brain to
emotional stressors is the fight-or-flight response, named for the
only prehistoric options to danger. It accelerates the heart,
breath and hormonal rates that are needed for strength and speed,
and it shuts down everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting and fleeing don't apply very well to the modern
stressors of rude retailers, unreasonable bosses, crying children
and empty checkbooks. That is why we have stress-management
programs, although McCraty says they still aren't prevalent in
corporate cultures that generate the most stress.
</P>
<P>
   The programs available for managing stress typically feature
either meditation or exercise, he says. Both approaches are aimed
at the brain's fight-or-flight response, raising the threshold
before it becomes disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're helpful, but they really don't get at the source of
the stress,'' McCraty says. That source begins with ``how we're
perceiving the events in our life,'' and proceeds to which emotions
the perceptions trigger and which heart patterns the emotions
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ultimately shift our perceptions,'' he says. ``The
same events are going to happen. We're not going to stop the
traffic jams. But we can modify how we're perceiving them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the HeartMath techniques, called Freeze-Frame, can be
used ``in the middle of a staff meeting or while you're talking to
someone on the phone,'' McCraty says. While meditation works at
preventing emotions from going out of control under stress, the
HeartMath team wanted to develop easy techniques that could be used
in the moment of stress _ more of a drive-through solution for a
drive-through world.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze-Frame begins with recognizing the stress and shifting the
focus away from the problem, toward the heart for at least 10
seconds. Then recall a happy moment _ of friendship, recognition or
enjoyable activity, for example _ and try to experience it again.
The idea is to learn how to create feelings of love or appreciation
that override the jagged heart rhythms of instinctive frustration
or anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart has a type of intelligence that's not cognitive,''
McCraty says, ``but more on the feeling level, more intuitive. It's
part of why we feel our emotions in the heart. That's been
recognized in folklore for centuries, but not in science until the
modern recognition that the heart is one of the key points in our
emotional system.

<P>
   PRIJEDOR, Bosnia and Herzegovina _ Three years ago, Zijad Music
arrived in Burlington, Vt., directly from the war that ripped apart
this city. He has been working like a dog ever since. He moves
furniture by day and works in a bakery at night, getting home just
in time to see his two daughters head off to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here,'' he said during a recent interview at a bar
in a Burlington mall. ``I'm really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Music is hardly a typical refugee of the war in the former
Yugoslavia. Although he entered the United States by portraying
himself as a victim of ethnic cleansing, Music appears to have been
a participant in one of the most brutal episodes of the war: the
deadly purge of some 60,000 non-Serbian civilians from Prijedor and
its surrounding villages in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Former Serb combatants, Bosnian refugees, and even Music's own
relatives identified Music as a former member of a ruthless
paramilitary unit that terrorized local Muslims and Croats during
the Serb army's campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The events here between 1992-95 were a grim preview of the
slaughter now taking place in Kosovo. A United Nations commission
concluded that the systematic application of murder, torture, rape,
and mass deportation in Prijedor constituted ``crimes against
humanity'' and probably genocide, resulting in the deaths of
thousands of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Music (pronounced Moo-shich), 39, denied he was ever part of the
much-feared paramilitary group, which called itself El Manijakos,
or The Maniacs.
</P>
<P>
   But Jean Ouellette, deputy district director of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service's regional office in Portland, Maine,
called the information gathered by the Globe about Music ``very,
very disturbing.'' Had the INS known of it beforehand, Ouellette
said, ``certainly the process wouldn't have resulted in the
granting of refugee status'' without an investigation of the
charges. He said the agency has begun a review of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Music's presence in Vermont has sparked fear and outrage within
Burlington's 4,000-member Bosnian community, and has raised
questions about the number of Serb collaborators who may have
slipped into the United States through the government's vast
refugee program, which provides a safe haven to tens of thousands
of people each year who are deemed to have been persecuted abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 83,247 Bosnian refugees who entered the United States
between 1993-98, most were Muslim and Croat civilians fleeing the
bloodiest war in Europe since World War II. However, in addition to
Music, there have been several recent reports of refugees with
possible links to ethnic cleansing who have surfaced in other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the INS opened an investigation into another Bosnian
refugee, Jezdimir Topic, after witnesses told the Globe that he had
served as a guard at the notorious Trnopolje prison camp outside
Prijedor before settling with his family in the Boston suburb of
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has identified another member of Music's paramilitary
group, Dragan Borcic, living in Bismarck, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are definitely part of a larger problem,'' said Shawn
Roberts, legal counsel for the Center for Justice and
Accountability, a San Francisco-based human rights organization
funded by Amnesty International. The group brought a civil suit
last year against Nikola Vuckovic, a Bosnian Serb refugee in
Atlanta who allegedly beat Muslim and Croat detainees with pipes,
bats, and other objects. The suit charges Vuckovic with genocide
and other crimes against humanity. He has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Music has not been charged with any crimes, and no suits have
been filed against him. He said people mistakenly have accused him
of being a member of El Manijakos because the Serbs forced him to
work as an accountant for the 43d Motorized Brigade, to which El
Manijakos reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are bitter and they're blaming me,'' he said, speaking
through a translator in his native Bosnian. ``I worked for the army
and so they automatically blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Music hinted that as a Bosnian Muslim who worked for
the Serbs, he may have taken actions he regrets to protect himself
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're supposed to save your own life, in a certain
situation, what are you supposed to do?'' he asked. ``I mean, you
have your family to protect and you're forced to do all kinds of
things. There were threats, and more threats, and then it all
played out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumping into one's persecutor after fleeing horrors experienced
thousands of miles away can be a refugee's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   One former Muslim resident of Prijedor who lives in Vermont and
requested anonymity, said of Music: ``I can't understand how the
aid agency and the American government could let him come in.
Everyone knows what he did. And they put him in Burlington, where
there are a lot of people from Prijedor.''
</P>
<P>
   US immigration officials did not interview Music before he
entered the country, said an INS official familiar with the case,
who added there is no indication he was even asked to fill out a
refugee application form, on which he would have been asked about
his military history. Music's persecution claim, the official said,
appeared to rest entirely on statements made by his wife, Asra, a
former nurse who was kidnapped and shot by Serb assailants along
with her mother and brother. Music's wife was the only one of the
three to survive the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what a great country we have,'' said the official, who
asked not to be named. ``A lot of the time in these refugee cases
it seems like they just throw open the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Music contended that the shooting proved that he and his family
had been persecuted by the Serbs like most Muslims in Prijedor.
However, several pieces of evidence suggest that the shootings _
which were confirmed by Serb military sources _ occurred despite
the fact that Music had been a member of one of the most dangerous
Serb ``hit squads.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence includes a homemade video, obtained by the Globe,
that shows Music wearing a distinctive El Manijakos patch on his
Serb uniform while serving as a pallbearer at the funeral of the
unit's commander, Dragan Janjetovic. The video also shows Music
drinking with about 30 members of El Manijakos, singing Serb
nationalist songs, and posing with a powerful M-34 machine gun
known to soldiers as the ``Sower of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Nusret Sivac, a former Bosnian Muslim resident of Prijedor,
identified Music as a member of El Manijakos in a book he wrote
about the Serb assault on the town. The unit, he said in an
interview, was ``responsible for doing the dirtiest deeds'' of
ethnic cleansing. ``They would do whatever they wanted: killing,
slaughtering, robbing, raping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of El Manijakos, Atko Blazevic, said in an
interview that he, Music, and five other members of the unit were
arrested and detained by Serb military police following a botched
1993 robbery attempt in which a woman was allegedly tortured.
Blazevic said the group had intended to force an elderly Muslim
couple from their home and give the house to a Serb family, a
common tactic used by the Serbs during ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Blazevic claimed that the crime wasn't his idea and that he
stayed outside the house while Music and the others went inside.
``You should ask Zijo about that; he was inside the house,'' said
Blazevic, using Music's nickname. ``He was with that old couple.
They picked him out when the military police came and asked who did
what.''
</P>
<P>
   Music said he was aware of accusations that he participated in
the crime but denied he committed it. Instead, he alleged that
Blazevic and three other members of El Manijakos were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about everything that happened there, but I wasn't
there,'' Music said.
</P>
<P>
   Semsa Suhonic, 67, said in an interview that while robbing her
home the attackers stuffed a rag in her mouth, kicked and beat her,
burned her breasts with cigarettes, dropped a heavy sack of corn on
her head, tried to hang her with a belt, slashed her clothes, and
drew a knife across her throat, cutting her, until she finally
begged them to kill her. The attack put her in the Prijedor
hospital for 12 days, according to a hospital certificate that
confirmed her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started burning my hair with matches and cigarettes,''
she said. ``Then one of them said, `Don't burn her hair, it smells.
Just light her on fire completely.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She said one of the men head-butted her several times, then, as
she slumped against a wood-paneled wall, stabbed a knife around her
head, and threatened to thrust it into her forehead if she refused
to give him money. She said the man then forced her to recite a
prayer from the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the police came they saw me all bloody and they asked,
`What did the guy who hit you the most look like?' '' said Suhonic,
who later gave her testimony to a Bosnian government commission
investigating war crimes. ``I said it was a balding guy, with a
black mustache, in a black coat. They said, `That's the Muslim,
grandma, that's our captain Ziko.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ziko is one of Music's nicknames. He has a receding hairline and
a mustache. Other refugees from Prijedor said he was often seen
wearing a black hat and coat.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bosnian refugees have cited Suhonic's account as evidence
that Music was one of the assailants. However, Suhonic was unable
to positively identify Music from a recent photo or pick him out of
the video of El Manijakos. She noted that six years had passed
since the incident. In addition, former members of the unit said
Music was not a captain but merely a soldier. Blazevic said the
group, including Music, was held for nearly a week by the Serbs,
then released.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military officials in Prijedor referred questions about
Music and El Manijakos to Major Milodrag Glusac of the 43d
Motorized Brigade. Glusac said he could not confirm the incident,
but that it sounded consistent with activities El Manijakos engaged
in, particularly when they drank.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Manijakos had problems with everybody when they got
drunk,'' Glusac said. He recalled Music as a good soldier who,
while a Muslim, was ``more of a Serb than half of the people in
Manijakos. . . . He performed his assignments very well. Of course
he did some small bad things, but everybody did a few bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   Music's apparent involvement with El Manijakos has left him
estranged from much of his family. His uncle, Sakib Music, said:
``He was worse than the Serbian Chetniks,'' the ultranationalists
charged with widespread abuses during the war. ``I'm his father's
younger brother, and I can tell you that he killed his father _ not
directly, but his father died of agony and suffering'' knowing what
Music had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd kill him if I could get my hands on him,'' Sakib Music
said.
</P>
<P>
   Music's aunt, Zekija Music, also said Music's father, Eniz, was
overcome with grief over his son's involvement with El Manijakos.
``He got sick and he died, yes, that's right,'' she said. But she
feels more pity than anger for her nephew. ``I feel bad for people
like Zijo, do you believe me?'' she said. ``The world has accused
them, condemned them. I feel bad because his own people hate him.
There's no more room for him with the Serbs or the Muslims. And
that's the real truth.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Little hint
</P>
<P>
   of horrors to come
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Music's relatives said he lived a rather ordinary life before
the war. A kung fu champion in his youth, he dressed well, worked
hard, and landed a job as an accountant at a state-run construction
company called Bosnamontaza. Eniz Music, his father, was one of the
most popular men in Prijedor, the helpful and affable manager of an
appliance store in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   Music courted his wife walking the promenades of Prijedor. Their
two daughters, said Sakib Music, ``are like golden apples.'' Zijad
Music's only affiliation with the military before the war was
mandatory duty as a reservist in the former Yugoslav army. Although
he is Muslim, he said his life wasn't much different than everyone
else's in Prijedor: he thought little of his ethnicity and counted
Serbs, Muslims, and Croats among his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine what kind of life we had,'' he said. ``We
had such a good life. For all of us to become enemies, when we all
speak the same language, when we all lived together so beautifully,
it was just like mass confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Music said he was still an army reservist when Yugoslavia began
to come apart in 1991. When the Serbs took over the military, he
said, they forced him to continue working ``on computers and
accounting. It was very difficult. Any mistake you made you could
be held accountable for; in a second you could be killed.'' He said
he left the military for good in 1993.

and into gymnasiums where competitions are held. (Sturrock, Palm

GM TO BUILD FUTURISTIC ASSEMBLY PLANT IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The General Motors Corp. has reached an
agreement on terms for completion of a futuristic factory in a
southern Brazilian state, which last week lost a similar project
planned by the Ford Motor Co. because of disagreements on how it
would be financed.
</P>
<P>
   In an accord reached on Saturday, GM agreed to earlier
repayments on a loan of about $150 million extended by the state of
Rio Grande do Sul so the car maker could move forward with the
plant, an innovative assembly operation known as Blue Macaw
expected to produce 120,000 subcompact automobiles a year.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to repay the loan more quickly, GM will ease some of
the budget anxieties that had led Rio Grande do Sul into conflict
with GM and Ford. GM had stopped construction and said that it
might have to delay opening the plant by as long as six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``By next week, work on the plant should be started again,''
said Luiz Moan, institutional affairs director for GM's Brazilian
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Rio Grande do Sul had said they could not afford to
spend money subsidizing the construction at the expense of
education and public welfare projects that have already been hurt
because of the country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Their position seemed to soften after Ford decided to leave,
taking the promise of hundreds of jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The $600 million GM factory, considered a prototype for future
GM plants in North America, is designed so that suppliers are
adjacent to the assembly of the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   GM chose the site because of a combination of incentives granted
by Rio Grande do Sul's previous government and the proximity to
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, Brazil's partners in the Mercosur
trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has yet to choose another site for its factory, a project
to produce a competing small automobile. Parana and Santa Catarina,
two other states in southern Brazil, have shown an interest in
luring Ford.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE NEXT NON-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at

 For release: Tues., May 4 or thereafter  
 By GERALDINE A. FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On January 20, 2001, it's an even chance that I'll be part of
the crowd outside the United States Capitol, bundled in a warm coat
and scarf but still freezing as I watch the next president of the
United States promise to support and defend the Constitution.
 &HT;    And it's almost certain that the hand on the Bible won't be
Lamar Alexander's.
 &HT;    Now, I'm not picking on the former Tennessee governor. It's also
pretty good odds that the person taking that oath won't be Gary
Bauer, Steve Forbes, John Kasich, Alan Keyes, Dan Quayle, Bob Smith
or even my former ``Crossfire'' partner, Pat Buchanan.
 &HT;    In the good old days, when candidates were chosen by political
bosses huddling in smoke-filled rooms, any of these men might have
had a chance. But today the voters do the picking, and getting to
those voters requires a political network and money _ lots and lots
of it.
 &HT;    Once upon a time, a dark-horse candidate could lie back and hope
the front-runner stumbled. Six back-of-the-packers took that
approach in 1992 against Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and were
rewarded when the front-runner's campaign crashed and burned.
Allegations of financial irregularities, draft-dodging and
marijuana use climaxed in a juicy sex scandal only days before the
all-important New Hampshire primary.
 &HT;    And still Clinton won.
 &HT;    So odds are that, come 2001, it will be Vice President Al Gore
or Gov. George W. Bush of Texas that we'll be calling ``Mr.
President.''
 &HT;    No, they're not the only prospects. Former Sen. Bill Bradley is
proving to be a formidable fundraiser and a credible alternative to
Gore, while Elizabeth Dole is new and exciting as the first female
to ever seriously contend for president. And with their experience
in government, no one questions for a minute that either would be
able to do the job as president.
 &HT;    But at 20 percent or more behind the front-runner, they face
formidable odds.
 &HT;    The rest of the candidates have virtually no chance, a fact that
seems apparent to everyone except themselves. Which raises the
obvious question: What makes these guys run?
 &HT;    I know a bit about losing campaigns. In 1984 I ran for vice
president on a ticket that started the campaign 18 points behind a
very popular incumbent president.
 &HT;    What did I think I was doing? Well, pundits told us it was
hopeless, but when the crowds were 10,000 and 20,000 deep on the
campaign trail I really believed we could win. I was also
convinced, having observed George Bush for four years, that I could
do the job.
 &HT;    But I had another incentive to give it my all. No matter what
happened on Election Day, the campaign was tearing down gender
barriers and opening doors of opportunity.
 &HT;    That might be the case with Pat Buchanan. Pat conceivably may be
deluding himself that he can win but, even if he doesn't, he will
fire up the extreme right merely by running, and make sure that the
issues he cares about are part of the debate.
 &HT;    Steve Forbes may simply believe he can buy the nomination. He's
a man who will bend in the political wind to shape his message into
whatever Republican voters want it to be, and he has the unlimited
financial resources to get that message heard.
 &HT;    The trouble is, he's not as rich as Ross Perot, and even Perot's
billions couldn't buy him a lease on the White House.
 &HT;    John McCain may simply not care what the odds are. The Arizona
senator, who happens to be my favorite of the group, is smart. He's
a war hero who's not an ideologue, and he tells the truth. The
latter two attributes, however, are probably his biggest obstacles
to raising the money he needs to be a plausible candidate.
 &HT;    Dan Quayle fills his own niche. He's a favorite of the
conservative money machine, and he's a former vice president. I
imagine he's noticed that, if Gore gets nominated, seven of the
last 10 vice presidents will have subsequently won nomination by
their party, and hopes he can make it an even eight.
 &HT;    Of course, none of them were running against their former boss'
namesake _ one Bush heir vs. another. But, that aside, his biggest
problem is getting people to stop giggling when he starts talking.
 &HT;    John Kasich may be running with the idea of raising his profile
for a future leadership role in the House, while Alan Keyes may be
in because he likes to debate and it means more and better paydays
on the lecture circuit in days to come.
 &HT;    But I can't conjure up even similarly weak reasons for Gary
Bauer, Lamar Alexander and Bob Smith to be in this race.
 &HT;    We politicians are often accused of being on ego trips, and in
some measure that's true: If you didn't believe you were better
than your opponents, you wouldn't be running.
 &HT;    But, unless you had some higher goal, I don't see how you could
subject yourself to the torment of fund raising, demanding voters,
unrelenting press criticism and grueling schedules if you didn't
believe you could win.
 &HT;    I'd bet that a lot of guys in positions of power in corporate
America, in professional organizations or in politics wake up
occasionally and say, ``I'm presidential material!''
 &HT;    Fortunately, they hit the snooze button and go back to sleep.
 &HT;    Too bad for the Republicans that half of their presidential
candidates didn't.
 &HT;    (Geraldine A. Ferraro, a former congresswoman and the Democratic
nominee for vice president in 1984, is a Manhattan-based

DISCOVERY OF MALLORY'S BODY STIRS DEBATE THAT HE CLIMBED EVEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is perhaps the 20th century's greatest unsolved exploration
mystery: Did Englishman George Leigh Mallory, clad in a tweed
jacket and felt hat, reach the summit of Mount Everest 29 years
before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay?
</P>
<P>
   A Northern California mountaineer-detective took a big step
toward answering that question Saturday when he discovered
Mallory's eerily well-preserved body high on Everest's windswept
north face.
</P>
<P>
   The remains, found on a ledge at about 27,000 feet where Mallory
apparently landed after a fatal fall, contain some tantalizing
clues that may help mountaineering historians unlock the
75-year-old riddle.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Anker of Big Oak Flat, Calif., who found the body, is
part of an expedition searching the upper flanks of the world's
highest mountain for clues to the fate of Mallory and his partner,
Andrew Irvine, who were spotted about 800 feet below the summit and
``going strong for the top'' before they disappeared into the
clouds June 8, 1924.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who believe Mallory may have reached the summit
before perishing is his grandson, Rick Millikan, a real estate
developer in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the odds are better than 50-50 that he did get up (to
the summit),'' said Millikan, 57, who added that the discovery of
his grandfather's frozen remains made him feel ``excited but a
little creepy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallory was the best-known mountaineer of his day, the dashingly
handsome, Cambridge-educated darling of British society. Asked why
he wanted to climb Everest, Mallory uttered the most famous phrase
in mountaineering history: ``Because it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallory and Irvine, a strong Oxford rower but inexperienced
mountaineer, were last seen alive high on Everest's Northeast Ridge
by Noel Odell, the expedition's geologist. The time was 12:50 p.m.,
and Odell wrote in his diary that the two appeared to be ``nearing
(the) base of (the) final pyramid.'' Minutes later, the clouds
closed in and they vanished into the mist.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they made the summit has been a mystery and controversy
debated from the venerable halls of the Alpine Club in London to
campfire circles in the Sierra Nevada for the last 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   One clue to the mystery emerged in 1975 when a Chinese climber,
Wang Hong Bao, told his teammates he had spotted the body of an
English climber in old-fashioned clothing on a ledge below the
Northeast Ridge. Before he could give more details, though, Wang
was swept to his death in an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Mallory's body was discovered at least 1,000 feet below where
Odell last saw him, and considerably farther back down the ridge
toward the climbers' highest camp. According to Erin Copland, the
Anker expedition's U.S.-based spokeswoman, it appears Mallory must
have been on his way down when the fatal accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The search, conducted in temperatures well below zero, was grim
work. Anker, reporting on the expedition's Web site
(www.mountainzone.com), said he had passed the remains of two more
recent Everest victims that morning before finding Mallory.
</P>
<P>
   The body was face down on a rock ledge. Copland said some of
Mallory's clothing had been torn away _ possibly during the fall _
but that his body ``was remarkably well preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to be at peace,'' Anker reported.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with the wishes of Mallory's family in England,
the climbers performed a brief ceremony and buried the body where
they found it.
</P>
<P>
   Before doing so, though, they uncovered important evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Mallory's mountain goggles were in a pocket inside his tweed
jacket, suggesting that he may have been descending after
nightfall, Copland said. And his body was still tied securely into
his climbing rope, which would seem to disprove a popular theory
that he had left Irving behind and continued alone toward the top.
</P>
<P>
   Anker and his teammates have descended to advanced base camp to
rest, and will return to the upper mountain to search for the body
of Irvine and the most important evidence of all: the Kodak
Vest-Pocket cameras Mallory and his partner were carrying.
</P>
<P>
   If either or both the climbers reached the summit, indisputable
proof probably lies within those metal boxes. Kodak engineers
believe that after 75 years in Everest's deep freeze, the film can
still yield usable images.
</P>
<P>
   Galen Rowell, a San Francisco area mountaineer and photographer,
has climbed high on Everest's north side twice and written about
the mystery of Mallory. It was apparently his reporting that helped
steer his friend Anker to the body. Rowell thinks the odds are that
Mallory probably didn't reach the top, but adds that ``nothing we
know right now rules out that he made it.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who's generally uncertain is Hillary. When he and
Tenzing made the first confirmed ascent of Everest in 1953, one of
the things he did during his short stay on the summit was search
for evidence that Mallory had preceded him. He didn't find any, but
he has always maintained there is a possibility he wasn't the first
on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tenzing and I would be downgraded a bit to be (only) the first
to reach the summit and survive, but I don't think we would
complain,'' he said in 1986. ``I personally believe that if anyone
has the right to be the first to be on top of Everest, it would be
George Leigh Mallory.''

CONVERSATION GOES BEYOND WORDS IN DEALING WITH TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ My son is 16.5 years old. That unremarkable
fact gained relevance as I followed the news of the Littleton
school massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Young people of my son's age and circumstances _ teen-age high
school students _ stopped living, suddenly and without warning, in
murders perpetrated by two well-armed schoolmates. Their demise is
beyond sad.
</P>
<P>
   Like countless others, I tried to figure out why this happened,
and like everyone else, have gotten no deeper than the usual
cliches, platitudes and banalities: We live in a violent society,
the mass media glorify violence; guns and bomb-making ingredients
are too easy to get.
</P>
<P>
   And what about parental responsibility? The public knows little
of the relationship between the two killers and their parents other
than superficial details, such as the fact that both young men had
middle-class parents who lived at home together.
</P>
<P>
   How could they not have known their sons were planning for a
year their deadly assault on the high school? After all, the
sheriff said, a sawed-off shotgun barrel and bomb parts were found
in one boy's room.
</P>
<P>
   I believe parents bear a great deal of responsibility for the
behavior of their offspring. Our behavior around the home has
enormous influence on our children. How we guide, nurture and
direct our children also has significant consequences as they
develop from totally dependent beings to fully independent ones.
But being the father of a teen-age boy is teaching me not to judge
too quickly how other parents shepherd their children. It's an age
when our freedoms are virtually unlimited, and the best of
technological and industrial output is at our fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   I consider myself close to my son. I am around the house all the
time. It is hard for us to avoid contact. But there are things I do
not know about him, and that is how he wants it right now. This is
an all-too-familiar pattern of adolescent behavior in our
post-modern, post-industrial age. It is called growing up.
</P>
<P>
   At 16, he is still largely dependent on us in a material sense _
for shelter, food, clothing. From the start, his mother and I did
what we could to instill a value system, ill-defined and
intangible, that we believe falls within the norm of a civilized
society. We have always told him we love him, and continue to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   His mind, his feelings, his emotional life, however, are areas
where we are less certain of his dependency on us, and that too is
as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   He has learned from us, and presumably will continue to learn
from us. He has had and will continue to have other mentors and
influences _ peers, teachers, relatives, and, yes, the dreaded mass
media.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Littleton massacre unfolded, he and his
mother had an emotional conversation about his right of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted his private space and time. He doesn't want his mother
or me to know too much about his friendships.
</P>
<P>
   He is fortunate to have close relationships with others his age
at a North Oakland after-school program called Destiny Arts Center,
which teaches martial arts, dance and performance as vehicles to
prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   It is a safe setting for him and other young people to share
deep feelings that are part of being a teen-ager today, whether
from middle-class or working-class backgrounds, regardless of
racial and ethnic heritages.
</P>
<P>
   My son and I have talked about the Littleton murders. He wrote a
powerful monologue about it for a performance Destiny Arts Center
is staging on May 21 and 22 at Holy Names College in Oakland _ and
I am pleased he, his mom, and I continue to talk, even if sometimes
he doesn't want to say too much to us.

PATAKI WALKS TIGHTROPE ON ISSUES DEAR TO GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As New York Gov. George Pataki takes his first,
faltering steps toward a spot on the Republican national ticket
next year, he's struggling to define himself to a nationwide
audience as a fiscal conservative and a social moderate. Each
position creates problems.
</P>
<P>
   As a fiscal conservative, the governor can't get a budget
through in his own state. And that's not merely because Democrats
in the Legislature want to spend more than he does. Pataki's fellow
Republicans want to spend more, too. They're fretting over what
they fear will be a tough election next year, especially in the
GOP-controlled state Senate. They want more state money to spread
around their districts before next year's races.
</P>
<P>
   As one Republican operative told me, New York remains a 5-3
Democratic state. A high turnout by an electorate still angry over
Bill Clinton's impeachment trial is a major concern for state
Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a lot of people,'' the operative told me, ``a Republican
senator is a Republican senator. They don't really distinguish
between Republican senators in Washington and Republican senators
in Albany.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-abortion movement is intensely powerful in the
Republican presidential primary process. If Pataki goes all out,
he'll have to sell his generally pro-choice view in states where
sentiment against abortion runs high in his party. In Heartland
states, a pro-choice position is difficult for GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of actually electing a Republican president
next year, however, Pataki is right. The most recent public polls
show that few Americans are comfortable with abortion, especially
late-term abortions. But nearly nine in 10 of us believe that a
woman should be able to obtain one if her health is seriously
endangered by the pregnancy, and three in five of us figure that
abortion is not the government's business.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than half of Americans agree with the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that
a woman could have an abortion at any point during the first three
months of pregnancy. But, in general, the polls indicate that
Americans view abortion as more acceptable early in pregnancy and
less acceptable later on.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly two in three Americans view abortion rights as
reasonable, two in five view abortion opponents as extremists and
three in four oppose a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Even among GOP voters, anti-abortion activists constitute a
distinct minority nationally. Nearly one in three Republicans
opposes abortion, but only one in four Republicans figures the
party should take a firm position against it. A larger percentage
of Republicans, one in three, believes that the GOP should leave
the issue alone.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, then, despite the 30 million abortions that have
taken place during the past quarter century, is that Roe. vs. Wade
seems to be settled law for most Americans. As a political issue,
abortion is really debated now at the margins _ parental
notification, later-term abortions, Medicaid funding for abortions
for poor women.
</P>
<P>
   What all that seems to mean for a pro-choice Republican seeking
a spot on next year's national ticket _ George Pataki, for example
_ is that the best way to argue his position to his party's
vigorous anti-abortion minority is simply to stress that most
voters don't share their views and that the party should avoid a
hard position on an issue on which so many Americans are so
ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tough sell to Republican voters in some parts of this
country. Ideally, a candidate pushing that view could change the
topic to how tight he is with taxpayer dollars. To do that, though,
a governor needs an austere state budget.
</P>
<P>
   So far, George Pataki doesn't have one.

GOLLY NED! MIDWESTERN IDIOM REDUX 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I don't know how they did it, but I am convinced
that long ago my parents implanted in me some sort of time-delay
computer chip. It is now going off.
</P>
<P>
   I decided this the other day after a disturbing incident in
which I tried to order a prosciutto-and-Gorgonzola sandwich at a
nearby coffee bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like the weekly special,'' I told the nice young counter
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which one of the specials?'' he said. ``The prosciutto or the
feta-and-tapenade?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you have two specials?'' I said, suddenly perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Then these words tumbled from my mouth: ``Golly, Ned!''
</P>
<P>
   The clerk blinked and said, ``Golly, Ned? I've never heard
anybody say `Golly, Ned!'''
</P>
<P>
   I mumbled that it was Midwestern idiom. I did not tell him that
I hadn't uttered it in at least 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   My mom says ``Golly, Ned'' a lot and has for as long as I can
remember. But I, the San Francisco sophisticate, do not say
``Golly, Ned.'' At least I didn't used to say it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the computer chip has been activated, who knows? The
Golly Ned shocker got me to paying attention to the rest of my
speech. It's riddled with Momisms _ and Dadisms.
</P>
<P>
   Upon seeing the slightly scuffed face of a friend, just off a
grueling, many-stops flight from New York, I shook my head and
said, ``What happened to you? You look like you've been sorting
wildcats.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother and father make the sorting-wildcats comment often.
</P>
<P>
   But in all my nearly 50 years, I think I never said it until I
saw my friend's face.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that, a colleague was trying to describe the
circuitous route she took to complete several errands. Groping for
the right words, she said, ``By the time I was finished it was like
I'd, uh, uh ...''
</P>
<P>
   Reflexively, I completed her sentence: ``You ended up having to
go around Joe Dilly's barn.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at me and said, ``Who the hell is Joe Dilly?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Never mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, my parents deny implanting a chip in me. But they
have no other explanation for why I'm all of a sudden using their
homey Midwestern phrases.
</P>
<P>
   I have to stay on the alert.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a friend from Back East told me she'd heard we
were having unseasonably chilly weather again in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It took Herculean strength to keep from saying, ``Yep, it's
colder out here than a well digger's wallet.''

NOT A WORRY IN THE WORLD WITH ANXIETY HOT LINE? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wednesday is National Anxiety Screening Day, and
I'm ready.
</P>
<P>
   I'm good and worried. Are you?
</P>
<P>
   Do you ever experience a sudden, unexplained attack of intense
fear, anxiety or panic for no apparent reason? Do you find it
difficult to control your worrying? Have you ever been afraid of
not being able to escape in certain situations?
</P>
<P>
   Those are three of the questions posed by a Massachusetts outfit
called the National Mental Illness Screening Project. It's a tough
time to be doing differential diagnosis on worrying.
</P>
<P>
   How do you tell from a few questions if you're one of the
estimated 19 million Americans with panic disorders, phobias,
obsessive-compulsive disorders or generalized anxiety disorders?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of us have sudden attacks of fear that the new millennium
could bring a stock market crash or a prolonged Balkans war. Is
that a natural human worry, or is it a panic disorder, which can be
treated with therapy?
</P>
<P>
   After the mass killings at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., a lot of us can't control our worrying about our kids. Is
that so nuts?
</P>
<P>
   Is it better if it's all in your head or not?
</P>
<P>
   If you're seriously anxious about something (or especially
nothing), call a hot line at 888-442-2022, and the National Mental
Illness Screening Project will give you some local numbers to call.
</P>
<P>
   I can't vouch for the shrinks you'll see, but the automated hot
line was very professional, although I don't know if it was nodding
reassuringly.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, this is the group that started an automated
depression hot line for city workers in Boston. It's a good thing
they didn't start it in San Francisco, because Mayor Willie Brown
would be on the line all the time.
</P>
<P>
   I'm worried that San Francisco has a civic-compulsive disorder.
People here keep doing the same things over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   A group of advocates of anonymous sex is trying to put a
initiative on the ballot to reopen the gay bathhouses that were
closed in 1984 because of the AIDS epidemic. Never mind that the
epidemic hasn't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a ballot initiative, naturally it has a marvelous
name, the Sexually Transmitted Disease Reduction Initiative. I
guess the idea is that getting groups of men together for anonymous
sex reduces transmission of disease because they'll be reading
pamphlets together.
</P>
<P>
   This is San Francisco, so there are people with even wilder and
safer ideas about sex.
</P>
<P>
   The people at Good Vibrations, San Francisco's leading sex toy
store, remind us that the safest sex of all is with someone you
really love _ yourself.
</P>
<P>
   May is the fourth annual National Masturbation Month, and Good
Vibrations is celebrating it with the first national
Masturbate-a-Thon. It's a fund-raiser for HIV-prevention charities
that works like bike-a-thons.
</P>
<P>
   You get people to pledge a certain sum for each minute you spend
enjoying the form of sex that former Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders
recommended as healthy, and the Catholic Church of yore did not.
Please, do not bring proof of time spent Jocelyning.

 IN INDIA, CHILDHOOD is FOR SALE

Syndicate sales representatives:

 &HT;    (--Latin America: OLIVIA VASQUEZ in Los Angeles, 310-798-0970;
fax, 310-798-7338.)  By SOMA WADHWA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Sonia is 12 and blind; not surprisingly, she has never played
with footballs, but from age six she was forced to stitch them,
eight hours a day, seven days a week. Her dainty, deft fingers
would often pierce her tiny hands with the needle as she pieced
together tough bits of leather.
 &HT;    But the child taught herself never to yelp in pain for fear of
losing employment, which would have threatened her family's
survival. Yet at the end of each day, she had not earned enough to
buy even a loaf of bread.
 &HT;    Still, Sonia was one of the lucky ones. Kailash Satyarthi, who
has been fighting child labor for the last two decades, raided the
factory _ media in tow _ where she and many other children worked.
After a tough fight through headlines that embarrassed the football
manufacturer, Mayor and Co., Sonia was given back her childhood.
She now lives in the state Vocational Rehabilitation Center for the
Blind in Ludhiana, Punjab.
 &HT;    Kailash, who is 44, has seen many such misery-ridden Sonias
through to happy endings, yet he is no invincible hero. In fact,
the crusade he has launched against child servitude in South Asia
has seen him coping with as many disheartening defeats as
victories.
 &HT;    ``How can I gloat over little triumphs when I see so many
children being wasted as overworked and underpaid help at squalid
factories, dingy shops and affluent urban homes every single day of
my life? When I know that parents still give children away at brick
kilns to work as bonded laborers as repayment of debt?''
 Millions of Workers, Millions of Slaves  
 &HT;    Sikander was 17 when he joined the Delhi shelter after six years
of inhuman working conditions in a carpet factory in the Mirzapur
district in Uttar Pradesh. Forced from age 10 to support a widowed,
ailing mother and two younger siblings, Sikander toiled 12 hours a
day to keep starvation at bay.
 &HT;    ``I worked in tin sheds, which get terribly hot during summers.
Also'' _ and he winced as he recalled those times _ ``we were often
beaten if we made any mistakes.'' Then he was rescued by Kailash's
network, and he is now training to become a welder.
 &HT;    Of the estimated 140 million working children in India, nearly
half are, in effect, slaves. Poverty-stricken parents who need
paltry sums of money _ sometimes just for basic sustenance _ borrow
from moneylenders and literally sign away their livelihoods
forever.
 &HT;    ``There is just too much of this around for us to feel content
about our work,'' Kailash said. ``A problem of such a large scale,
I have come to believe, has to be fought strategically: Raids,
rescue and rehabilitation have to go hand in hand with engineering
national and international aversion and support against child
labor.''
 &HT;    This is the philosophy that Kailash practices, that has spurred
him and his organization, the South Asian Coalition Against Child
Servitude, to identify and liberate more than 34,000 children
working in industries across India, where grimy little hands
working to fight hunger are an accepted reality. Even the upwardly
mobile middle-class thinks little of employing young children to
prepare their morning cuppa because such domestic help is plentiful
and cheap.
 &HT;    And parents in the poverty-ridden rural pockets are often forced
to barter their children to repay debts that keep death away.
 The Economics of Bonded Labor  
 &HT;    Many companies fight to keep child laborers at work because to
the manufacturers, it makes good economic sense. Factories making
carpets, sporting goods, firecrackers, bangles and brassware prefer
smaller hands to do the intricate work especially because children
do not demand better working conditions or more pay.
 &HT;    There are also criminal elements who conspire to control the
network of children in servitude and thwart the laws that ban
employment of youngsters. As a result, no employer has ever been
punished for violating a 1986 act that prohibits employing children
in the carpet industry, a sector defined as hazardous. Frequently,
employers of child labor shield their enterprises by posing as
family concerns.
 &HT;    Kailash has attacked this evil despite the many powerful
interests that resist any change that could damage profit margins.
 &HT;    He also recognized that the rescued children need
rehabilitation, and in 1991, he established the Mukti Ashram
(Shelter for the Liberated) in Delhi, which is run by volunteers.
He has also established 14 informal education centers, which are
funded by such international agencies as Bread for the World,
Christian Aid, Terre des Hommes and Miserior.
 &HT;    The first shelter found Kailash knocking on doors _ literally _
with requests for donations. ``I guess because the initiation of
the shelter saw ordinary people personally involving themselves in
the cause by giving it their hard-earned money,'' he said, ``the
project has always been run at a personal level: Each child is
special to us. Before we train them in a vocation, we make sure
there is a need for such skills in their village. If the locality
has no tailors or is short on a radio repairer, then that's the
skill we prepare the child for. Along with education, of course.''
 Escape Through Education
 &HT;    At Mukti Ashram, the children get basic training in literacy,
health and social issues. Those over 14 get vocational training in
such trades as carpentry, tailoring and making cane and bamboo
products. There are group discussions on the legal system and
children's rights, as well as current political issues. The
youngsters also help manage the ashram, thus acquiring leadership
skills.
 &HT;    Once the children return to their villages, the ashram keeps
track of how they fare. Many become economically independent,
setting up small enterprises. Most importantly, these rehabilitated
youngsters are helping to teach their communities to fight for
their rights in order to prevent further bondage.
 &HT;    Some of the youngsters return to help Kailash in the
raid-and-rescue operations. Thirteen-year-old Mohan, from Bihar
state, was rescued from a carpet factory in Uttar Pradesh, where he
had worked from age seven to 10. After a year in the Mukti Ashram
in New Delhi, it became clear that he was a bright youngster, and
Kailash enrolled him in one of the marches against child labor.
After this Mohan returned to his village and gave talks in local
schools about the cruel realities of child labor.
 &HT;    Fourteen-year-old Govind is doing the same. An underpaid
telephone booth attendant during the day and a cook at night for a
shopkeeper in the Nepal-Sikkim border town Jhaba, the boy was
rescued by Kailash's activists about three years ago. Once at the
shelter, Govind impressed everyone by his quick mind and grasp of
academic subjects, so he was encouraged to be part of all the
coalition's rallies and marches.
 &HT;    He returned from a three-week visit to his village near Jhaba
and informed Kailash about the local networks that he has set up
there. He went to each family in his village and informed them of
the poor conditions their children work in once they are sent away
to the bigger cities.
 &HT;    ``He is so fired up by what he has learnt here,'' Kailash said,
``that he now plans to go to different villages in India and talk
of his experiences as a child who had to work 16 hours a day. My
children are all so bright. They are going to change society.'' He
calls them ``young multipliers of the message.''
 &HT;    Through the Coalition, which was founded in 1989, Kailash has
supplemented these individual rescue operations with a vigorous
campaign to garner public opinion against child labor. Today The
South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude comprises 400 partner
organizations, including human rights groups and trade unions in
Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.
 &HT;    ``The need for comrades in the combat was obvious,'' he said.
``I realized that children in the region were all facing the same
pernicious fate, and that the fight had to be for all of them.
Banning child labor in India would only shift businesses that
thrive on such inexpensive labor to the neighboring countries.
These children are ours, you cannot shun their problems because
they don't share your nationality.''
 &HT;    Every wall in Kailash's small, functional office in South Delhi
seems to reflect this belief. Huge black and white photographs of
children from South Asian countries who are working away their
childhood crowd the office, reminders that millions will have to
join hands to save the millions suffering.
 &HT;    He points at them and says, ``Children are world citizens and
the world must come together to save them.''
 &HT;    It was this global outlook that brought Kailash to push through
a carpet-consumers' awareness campaign that culminated in the
creation of Rugmark, a label that certifies carpets made without
child labor. To be Rugmark-certified, carpet manufacturers agree to
independent monitoring and inspections. A presentation by Kailash
in 1991 before a U.N. human rights subcommission in Geneva resulted
in U.N. endorsement of the label.
 The Power of a Positive Label 
 &HT;    He is unwilling to hazard a guess on the percentage of carpet
manufacturers who comply with the Rugmark requirements, but he
points out that Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Britain and the
United States import only Rugmark carpets from the Subcontinent.
The certification is not foolproof, of course.
 &HT;    James Tufenkian, an American who is on the board of Rugmark and
whose company employs about 6,000 weavers in Nepal, was quoted in
The New York Times last October as saying, ``While Rugmark's heart
is 100 percent in the right place, how can we know what's really
going on in the weavers' homes?''
 &HT;    Added to these advocacy efforts, Kailash has organized many
marches in India and Nepal as part of an ongoing protest against
child labor. His latest effort saw him co-ordinating a Global March
Against Child labor this year. Commencing in January 1998, the
march saw activists, supporters and many a child laborer march in
Asia, Africa, America, Australia and Europe and many of them
traveled to Geneva in June for the drafting of a new convention on
child labor by the International labor Organization.
 &HT;    ``Marches have been so much a part of the Indian tradition of
protest,'' Kailash says. ``Mahatma Gandhi used marches effectively
to protest British laws.'' Kailash also wrote 800 letters to
organize different groups for the March to Geneva.
 &HT;    Gauri Pradhan, of NGO Child Workers in Nepal, credits Kailash
with having made the cause a regional rather than a
country-specific issue; Ishtiaque Ahmed, who works against child
labor in Dhaka, Bangladesh, credits Kailash with perseverance and
vision.
 &HT;    Not that Kailash is hungering for appreciation; he is quite
prepared to meet any criticism that might come his way and advances
some himself: ``People might say we have no business touring the
world when the problem of child labor is nowhere near eradication
back home. But that's a very narrow approach. In today's globalized
world you can't sort out anything by remaining home.''
 An Early Start  
 &HT;    Kailash's first brush with child labor was close to home in a
small town in Madhya Pradesh. Perplexed to see the cobbler's son
not attending school like him, 7-year-old Kailash innocently asked
why, only to be told that children born to the ``untouchable''
castes in India have no option but to work.
 &HT;    The sentence stuck with him. So did the desire to change the
terrible truth of the statement.
 &HT;    Years later, while studying electrical engineering at the
Regional Engineering School in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh state, where
he was born, he organized a book bank to help those students who
could not afford new textbooks.
 &HT;    After teaching engineering for a few years Kailash decided to
work more directly for social change. ``The world had to know the
shocking truth. And I chose not to remain with a mainstream
profession but to change things. I walked out of home.'' Now,
others walk with him, in his marches against the sale of childhood.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Sonia is 12 and blind; not surprisingly, she has never played
with footballs, but from age six she was forced to stitch them,
eight hours a day, seven days a week. Her dainty, deft fingers
would often pierce her tiny hands with the needle as she pieced
together tough bits of leather.
 &HT;    But the child taught herself never to yelp in pain for fear of
losing employment, which would have threatened her family's
survival. Yet at the end of each day, she had not earned enough to
buy even a loaf of bread.
 &HT;    Still, Sonia was one of the lucky ones. Kailash Satyarthi, who
has been fighting child labor for the last two decades, raided the
factory _ media in tow _ where she and many other children worked.
After a tough fight through headlines that embarrassed the football
manufacturer, Mayor and Co., Sonia was given back her childhood.
She now lives in the state Vocational Rehabilitation Center for the
Blind in Ludhiana, Punjab.
 &HT;    Kailash, who is 44, has seen many such misery-ridden Sonias
through to happy endings, yet he is no invincible hero. In fact,
the crusade he has launched against child servitude in South Asia
has seen him coping with as many disheartening defeats as
victories.
 &HT;    ``How can I gloat over little triumphs when I see so many
children being wasted as overworked and underpaid help at squalid
factories, dingy shops and affluent urban homes every single day of
my life? When I know that parents still give children away at brick
kilns to work as bonded laborers as repayment of debt?''
 Millions of Workers, Millions of Slaves  
 &HT;    Sikander was 17 when he joined the Delhi shelter after six years
of inhuman working conditions in a carpet factory in the Mirzapur
district in Uttar Pradesh. Forced from age 10 to support a widowed,
ailing mother and two younger siblings, Sikander toiled 12 hours a
day to keep starvation at bay.
 &HT;    ``I worked in tin sheds, which get terribly hot during summers.
Also'' _ and he winced as he recalled those times _ ``we were often
beaten if we made any mistakes.'' Then he was rescued by Kailash's
network, and he is now training to become a welder.
 &HT;    Of the estimated 140 million working children in India, nearly
half are, in effect, slaves. Poverty-stricken parents who need
paltry sums of money _ sometimes just for basic sustenance _ borrow
from moneylenders and literally sign away their livelihoods
forever.
 &HT;    ``There is just too much of this around for us to feel content
about our work,'' Kailash said. ``A problem of such a large scale,
I have come to believe, has to be fought strategically: Raids,
rescue and rehabilitation have to go hand in hand with engineering
national and international aversion and support against child
labor.''
 &HT;    This is the philosophy that Kailash practices, that has spurred
him and his organization, the South Asian Coalition Against Child
Servitude, to identify and liberate more than 34,000 children
working in industries across India, where grimy little hands
working to fight hunger are an accepted reality. Even the upwardly
mobile middle-class thinks little of employing young children to
prepare their morning cuppa because such domestic help is plentiful
and cheap.
 &HT;    And parents in the poverty-ridden rural pockets are often forced
to barter their children to repay debts that keep death away.
 The Economics of Bonded Labor  
 &HT;    Many companies fight to keep child laborers at work because to
the manufacturers, it makes good economic sense. Factories making
carpets, sporting goods, firecrackers, bangles and brassware prefer
smaller hands to do the intricate work especially because children
do not demand better working conditions or more pay.
 &HT;    There are also criminal elements who conspire to control the
network of children in servitude and thwart the laws that ban
employment of youngsters. As a result, no employer has ever been
punished for violating a 1986 act that prohibits employing children
in the carpet industry, a sector defined as hazardous. Frequently,
employers of child labor shield their enterprises by posing as
family concerns.
 &HT;    Kailash has attacked this evil despite the many powerful
interests that resist any change that could damage profit margins.
 &HT;    He also recognized that the rescued children need
rehabilitation, and in 1991, he established the Mukti Ashram
(Shelter for the Liberated) in Delhi, which is run by volunteers.
He has also established 14 informal education centers, which are
funded by such international agencies as Bread for the World,
Christian Aid, Terre des Hommes and Miserior.
 &HT;    The first shelter found Kailash knocking on doors _ literally _
with requests for donations. ``I guess because the initiation of
the shelter saw ordinary people personally involving themselves in
the cause by giving it their hard-earned money,'' he said, ``the
project has always been run at a personal level: Each child is
special to us. Before we train them in a vocation, we make sure
there is a need for such skills in their village. If the locality
has no tailors or is short on a radio repairer, then that's the

health and social issues. Those over 14 get vocational training in

 &HT;    
 By JOHN POWERS  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    The first person pronoun has been displaced in America: I am no
longer me, I am he.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton has been known to refer to himself as The
President. Mike Tyson (who, me?) claimed that Mike Tyson chewed
Evander Holyfield's ear. Maradona said that soccer didn't
understand Maradona.
 &HT;    Even Dilbert's Dogbert said that Dogbert, henceforth, would
refer to himself as Dogbert.
 &HT;    The vertical pronoun, this reporter declares, is falling into
disuse. I has turned into he, that man over there who I used to be.
If he does well, I admire him. If he misbehaves, I disavow him. The
first person has been eclipsed by the third person in America. The
Me Decade has given way to the He Decade. I is out of step with the
way we live now. I is egotistical. I is self-centered. I is
immodest. I lacks diversity.
 &HT;    He is more dispassionate, more detached, more humble than I am.
He is greater and, when convenient, lesser than I. He gladly
accepts honors that I am reluctant to bestow upon myself. He
willingly shoulders blame for the shameful things that I do.
 &HT;    He stands apart from, and often above, me, which may be why
politicians, athletes, rock stars, cult leaders, authors, even
cartoon characters have come to prefer him to themselves. He is
whom I defer to when celebrity makes me bigger than myself.
``Dogbert does this,'' says Dilbert's canine executive, ``to
emphasize his special brand of greatness.''
 &HT;    Elvis wasn't bad, Little Richard once said, ``but Little Richard
is the king of rock 'n' roll.'' David Koresh grew to such
greatness, before he went wacko in Waco, that he made himself his
own lackey, calling himself ``David, my servant.''
 &HT;    Julius Caesar was the first to go third. At least he's the first
we know about, probably because he wrote his own history. Caesar's
Commentaries feature Caesar the historian coolly appraising Caesar
the commander. ``What Caesar thought would happen, did happen,''
Caesar writes about Caesar.
 &HT;    Caesar went a bit overboard when he progressed from proconsul to
dictator, putting Caesar's image on coins and Caesar's name on
triumphal arches. When he was murdered by senators who had tired of
his third-person egomania, Caesar's final word was Caesar: ``Et tu,
Brute? Then fall, Caesar.''
 &HT;    When I grow too big for me, he is the only recourse left. That's
what Bob Dole realized when he ran for president in 1996. When Dole
was a simple senator from Kansas, he still could be I. Kansas is a
flat state with few echoes and more corncobs than people, a place
where a man rarely needs to stand apart from himself.
 &HT;    But when Dole began jetting around the Republic, seeing his face
a hundred feet high on billboards and hearing his name
reverberating across news cycles _ BobDole BobDole BobDole _ he
concluded that he had evolved into Him. Dole managed to stand apart
from himself so completely that when he went back home, or so his
American Express ad says, folks at the diner wanted to see some ID.
 &HT;    Had Dole been elected, of course, he could have referred to
himself as The President, as Richard Nixon, George Bush, and Gerald
Ford did. That's the formal, ex officio version of third
personhood. It's respectful of the office, and it indicates that
the chief executive considers himself merely another citizen, just
as the Constitution tells us he should. Even the president doesn't
get to refer to The President as I.
 &HT;    Protocol dictates as much. The official White House daily diary
never mentions a man named Bill Clinton. It's: The President had
breakfast. ... The President held a photo opportunity on the lawn.
... The President received a personal delivery from the pizza girl.
 &HT;    That's why Nixon never used I when he was wearing his
presidential wingtips and speaking for posterity. ``The President
made this decision himself,'' Nixon said about the man who bombed
Hanoi. Nor did he call his autobiography My Life. He called it
``The Memoirs of Richard Nixon.'' He wasn't The President anymore,
after all.
 &HT;    Ex officio third personhood is simply a practical acknowledgment
that any president, like his predecessors and successors, is a
transient. It would be confusing (and a grammatical nuisance) to
have I mean Richard Nixon, then The President for a quadrennium or
two, then Richard Nixon again.
 &HT;    On a more local scene, for a time, while he bestrode Boston's
City Hall like a colossus, Mayor Kevin White sent aloof memorandums
to the City Council which that began: ``I desire to provide
compensation to ...'' But that annoyed the councilors, who grumbled
that the mayor was using the words of a king.
 &HT;    So White shelved the vertical pronoun and began referring to
himself as The Mayah and, after he left office, as Kevin White.
``It was an accepted fact that Kevin White was powerful,'' he told
an interviewer, ``and nothing happened without his approval.''
 &HT;    The third person is not only more impersonal but also more
polite. That's why Miss Manners, the nation's mistress of
etiquette, scrupulously refers to herself as Miss Manners. That's
why Wade Boggs (perhaps not coincidentally, a third baseman) rarely
said I-me-my. ``My father always told me not to be a braggart, not
to say I, I, I,'' he said.
 &HT;    The first person attracts attention; the third person deflects
it. ``Look at me!'' demurely becomes ``Look at him!'' Muhammad Ali,
who once composed a two-word ode-to-self (``Me./Whee!''), irked
much of the citizenry during his ``I am the greatest'' phase. But
once he began referring to himself as Ali, he became a planetary
good-will ambassador.
 &HT;    Oscar Robertson, who was such a gifted basketball player that he
was known in the '60s by his first name only, never felt
comfortable evaluating himself directly until he evolved from first
to third. ``I never said how great I was or told anyone I could do
this or that,'' Robertson wrote in a recent advertising feature.
``I will say, however, that no one could play the game of
basketball any better than Oscar Robertson.''
 &HT;    But the third person is at his most useful when he serves as
whipping boy for the first person, when he provides distance and
deniability. I didn't lose 31 states to the Arkansas adulterer. Bob
Dole did. I didn't cover up the Watergate break-in. The President
did. I didn't have sex with groupies on Boston Red Sox road trips.
Wade Boggs, that randy single-slapping ballplayer, did.
 &HT;    I'm not him except when I get me in trouble. That person who
behaved so abominably at last night's cocktail party wasn't me, a
morning-after F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote to his hostess. It was
another man who is often mistaken for me.
 &HT;    Everyone wants to separate his ego from his alter ego, his
better half from his worse. ``I was the first that could thus plod
in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a
moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring
headlong into the sea of liberty,'' the upright Henry Jekyll mused
about drugging himself into the sinister Edward Hyde. ``It was
Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty.''
 &HT;    There are legal advantages, of course, to separating the first
person from the third, which is why the government allows us to
form corporations in our own names. If G.J. Caesar loses his nest
egg on his bottled salad-dressing business, his possessions are
sold at a yard sale and he is hauled off to debtor's prison. But if
G.J. Caesar Inc. goes Chapter 11, Caesar still gets to keep his
hillside mansion in Latium, his Maserati, and his closetful of
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
 &HT;    Third personhood works, too, for the author who finds himself a
character in his own book and isn't sure how to explicate himself
dispassionately. So he sings a Song of Himself.
 &HT;    ``Still, Mailer had a complex mind of sorts,'' Norman Mailer
wrote in ``The Armies of the Night,'' where he appeared both as the
Participant and the Novelist. ``Like a later generation which was
to burn holes in their brain on Speed, he had given his own head
the texture of a fine Swiss cheese.''
 &HT;    John Updike created a third person named Henry Bech and, after
several sequels, wasn't sure what to do with him. ``For some years
now, Bech had felt his author wanting to set him aside, to get him
off the desk forever,'' Bech wrote about Updike writing about Bech.
 &HT;    The problem with He, of course, is that he won't stay him. He
reverts to Me at the most embarrassing moments. The good Jekyll
could not prevent the evil Hyde from spilling over. The Great Oz
could only boom and bellow for so long (``Pay no attention to that
man behind the curtain'') before he was exposed as the bumbling
Professor Marvel, premier balloonist par excellence of the Miracle
Wonderland Carnival Company.
 &HT;    Eventually, fake IDs get confiscated by the doorman, and split
personalities end up on the psychiatrist's couch. Popeye had it
down: ``I yam what I yam and that's all what I yam.'' Much as we
would like to stand apart from ourselves, we are, like our nation,
indivisible.
 &HT;    I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together,
wrote John Lennon. As the saying goes: The first shall be third and
the third first.

 &HT;    
 By JOHN POWERS  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    The first person pronoun has been displaced in America: I am no
longer me, I am he.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton has been known to refer to himself as The
President. Mike Tyson (who, me?) claimed that Mike Tyson chewed
Evander Holyfield's ear. Maradona said that soccer didn't
understand Maradona.
 &HT;    Even Dilbert's Dogbert said that Dogbert, henceforth, would
refer to himself as Dogbert.
 &HT;    The vertical pronoun, this reporter declares, is falling into
disuse. I has turned into he, that man over there who I used to be.
If he does well, I admire him. If he misbehaves, I disavow him. The
first person has been eclipsed by the third person in America. The
Me Decade has given way to the He Decade. I is out of step with the
way we live now. I is egotistical. I is self-centered. I is
immodest. I lacks diversity.
 &HT;    He is more dispassionate, more detached, more humble than I am.
He is greater and, when convenient, lesser than I. He gladly
accepts honors that I am reluctant to bestow upon myself. He
willingly shoulders blame for the shameful things that I do.
 &HT;    He stands apart from, and often above, me, which may be why
politicians, athletes, rock stars, cult leaders, authors, even
cartoon characters have come to prefer him to themselves. He is
whom I defer to when celebrity makes me bigger than myself.
``Dogbert does this,'' says Dilbert's canine executive, ``to
emphasize his special brand of greatness.''
 &HT;    Elvis wasn't bad, Little Richard once said, ``but Little Richard
is the king of rock 'n' roll.'' David Koresh grew to such
greatness, before he went wacko in Waco, that he made himself his
own lackey, calling himself ``David, my servant.''
 &HT;    Julius Caesar was the first to go third. At least he's the first
we know about, probably because he wrote his own history. Caesar's
Commentaries feature Caesar the historian coolly appraising Caesar
the commander. ``What Caesar thought would happen, did happen,''
Caesar writes about Caesar.
 &HT;    Caesar went a bit overboard when he progressed from proconsul to
dictator, putting Caesar's image on coins and Caesar's name on
triumphal arches. When he was murdered by senators who had tired of
his third-person egomania, Caesar's final word was Caesar: ``Et tu,
Brute? Then fall, Caesar.''
 &HT;    When I grow too big for me, he is the only recourse left. That's
what Bob Dole realized when he ran for president in 1996. When Dole
was a simple senator from Kansas, he still could be I. Kansas is a
flat state with few echoes and more corncobs than people, a place
where a man rarely needs to stand apart from himself.
 &HT;    But when Dole began jetting around the Republic, seeing his face
a hundred feet high on billboards and hearing his name
reverberating across news cycles _ BobDole BobDole BobDole _ he
concluded that he had evolved into Him. Dole managed to stand apart
from himself so completely that when he went back home, or so his
American Express ad says, folks at the diner wanted to see some ID.
 &HT;    Had Dole been elected, of course, he could have referred to
himself as The President, as Richard Nixon, George Bush, and Gerald
Ford did. That's the formal, ex officio version of third
personhood. It's respectful of the office, and it indicates that
the chief executive considers himself merely another citizen, just
as the Constitution tells us he should. Even the president doesn't
get to refer to The President as I.
 &HT;    Protocol dictates as much. The official White House daily diary
never mentions a man named Bill Clinton. It's: The President had
breakfast. ... The President held a photo opportunity on the lawn.
... The President received a personal delivery from the pizza girl.
 &HT;    That's why Nixon never used I when he was wearing his
presidential wingtips and speaking for posterity. ``The President
made this decision himself,'' Nixon said about the man who bombed
Hanoi. Nor did he call his autobiography My Life. He called it
``The Memoirs of Richard Nixon.'' He wasn't The President anymore,
after all.
 &HT;    Ex officio third personhood is simply a practical acknowledgment
that any president, like his predecessors and successors, is a
transient. It would be confusing (and a grammatical nuisance) to
have I mean Richard Nixon, then The President for a quadrennium or
two, then Richard Nixon again.
 &HT;    On a more local scene, for a time, while he bestrode Boston's
City Hall like a colossus, Mayor Kevin White sent aloof memorandums
to the City Council which that began: ``I desire to provide
compensation to ...'' But that annoyed the councilors, who grumbled
that the mayor was using the words of a king.
 &HT;    So White shelved the vertical pronoun and began referring to
himself as The Mayah and, after he left office, as Kevin White.
``It was an accepted fact that Kevin White was powerful,'' he told
an interviewer, ``and nothing happened without his approval.''
 &HT;    The third person is not only more impersonal but also more
polite. That's why Miss Manners, the nation's mistress of
etiquette, scrupulously refers to herself as Miss Manners. That's
why Wade Boggs (perhaps not coincidentally, a third baseman) rarely
said I-me-my. ``My father always told me not to be a braggart, not
to say I, I, I,'' he said.
 &HT;    The first person attracts attention; the third person deflects
it. ``Look at me!'' demurely becomes ``Look at him!'' Muhammad Ali,
who once composed a two-word ode-to-self (``Me./Whee!''), irked
much of the citizenry during his ``I am the greatest'' phase. But
once he began referring to himself as Ali, he became a planetary
good-will ambassador.
 &HT;    Oscar Robertson, who was such a gifted basketball player that he
was known in the '60s by his first name only, never felt
comfortable evaluating himself directly until he evolved from first
to third. ``I never said how great I was or told anyone I could do
this or that,'' Robertson wrote in a recent advertising feature.
``I will say, however, that no one could play the game of
basketball any better than Oscar Robertson.''
 &HT;    But the third person is at his most useful when he serves as
whipping boy for the first person, when he provides distance and
deniability. I didn't lose 31 states to the Arkansas adulterer. Bob
Dole did. I didn't cover up the Watergate break-in. The President
did. I didn't have sex with groupies on Boston Red Sox road trips.
Wade Boggs, that randy single-slapping ballplayer, did.
 &HT;    I'm not him except when I get me in trouble. That person who
behaved so abominably at last night's cocktail party wasn't me, a
morning-after F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote to his hostess. It was
another man who is often mistaken for me.
 &HT;    Everyone wants to separate his ego from his alter ego, his
better half from his worse. ``I was the first that could thus plod
in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a

headlong into the sea of liberty,'' the upright Henry Jekyll mused
about drugging himself into the sinister Edward Hyde. ``It was
Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty.''
 &HT;    There are legal advantages, of course, to separating the first
person from the third, which is why the government allows us to
form corporations in our own names. If G.J. Caesar loses his nest
egg on his bottled salad-dressing business, his possessions are
sold at a yard sale and he is hauled off to debtor's prison. But if
G.J. Caesar Inc. goes Chapter 11, Caesar still gets to keep his
hillside mansion in Latium, his Maserati, and his closetful of
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
 &HT;    Third personhood works, too, for the author who finds himself a

indivisible.

 &HT;    It has become a televisual cliche. The 45-second parade of
refugees' vignettes, followed by the reporters' brow-creased
displays of concern. Then the question from the anchor, in response
to which reporters soften their voices to tell us how the personal
dimension of the tragedy pierced their professional husks.
 &HT;    Except it really isn't so. The backstage truth is that no matter
how tenderhearted reporters may be at the outset, any capacity for
empathy is all but drowned by the sheer flow of suffering during
wartime.
 &HT;    Most war reporters must cultivate a controlled schizophrenia to
survive. We develop a sangfroid, a mordant humor and a studied
machismo, much the same way that cops and ER doctors do.
 &HT;    As we interview dozens of victims, usually through interpreters,
the barbarities start to merge, to become prosaic even, especially
as deadlines loom. Garnish this with the logistics of filing the
story and the fierce competition with other channels, and soon the
individual plights we witness flash by like passing traffic.
 &HT;    I learned this in my years as a foreign correspondent in Africa.
It was my job to try to get you involved in the conflicts there, to
engage you in the way that you have now become so engaged in
Kosovo. Mostly, I failed.
 &HT;    The wars I covered were obscure. They were in places that did
not affect ``vital interests.'' The conflicts were devoid of the
high-tech footage taken by missile-mounted cameras; to outsiders
the people involved looked and sounded confusingly alike. Their
courage _ the kind of courage presented by a life with nothing left
to lose but itself _ was often mistaken for the myth of Third World
fatalism. Worst of all, in the atrocity ratings war, both the
casualties and the perpetrators were black.
 &HT;    And so I found you weren't particularly interested in an old
chief in Matabeleland, standing against a blood-orange sun and
defying a squad of murderous soldiers. ``I must speak the truth and
shame the devil,'' he pronounced.
 &HT;    Nor were you interested in Bongali Dube, a thin young man who
led me up a small hill to a pile of bones. ``This is my father,''
he said, as if introducing me to a living man. He had been warned
by soldiers not to bury the body, and it had been eaten by dogs.
 &HT;    Nor were you even interested in the Ugandan town of Mbale,
nestled beneath the towering green cone of Mount Elgon, where the
old Edwardian clock tower had been used as a backdrop for a firing
squad; corpses were still sprawled against it. When the clock
struck noon they shivered with each chime.
 &HT;    The hospital there was empty, except for those too ill to flee.
A rivulet of blood still flowing from under a door led us to a
white-coated mound of executed doctors. But the restless
searchlight of international attention had flicked elsewhere.
 &HT;    How can anyone decide what, in this parade of Hogarthian horrors
all clamoring for attention, to zoom in on? Whose suffering do we
broadcast as representative? The family whose father was dispatched
in a particularly gory way? The one that speaks English? Of course,
the most telegenic win the audition.
 &HT;    The ``victims'' instinctively understand this. They are not
interested in hand-holding or in our bogus words of small comfort;
they have no use for our threadbare empathy. They know that come
nightfall we will be back in the Hotel Splendide, while they still
sleep in the open. They understand that we are simply there to
amplify their suffering to a far wider audience. I remember a man
in Matabeleland.
 &HT;    ``We hope you put our problems on the World Service,'' he said
in halting English. ``Otherwise our future will run out. Surely,
surely.'' He gave a solemn bow and shook my hand.
 &HT;    But this faith is often misplaced. What light we can shed on
refugees' plight usually falls too late. The slow and deliberate
shuffle toward the ethnic endgame in Kosovo, so obvious to all of
us who had been there, elbowed its way to the top of the evening
lineup only when it was already too late to prevent.
 &HT;    And the attention span of war correspondents is only as long as
that of our viewers. When your finger hits the remote, we must
leave and seek out a more entertaining tragedy.
 &HT;    The terrible reality is that the more visible the suffering, the
more we get on the air. We grow with the story. So we end up as
practitioners of the ``something must be done'' school of
journalism, automatic advocates of intervention _ as much out of
professional self-interest as genuine humanitarian concern.
 &HT;    Most of us are attracted to this job by the glamour of it. But
in the end, protracted exposure to violence and tragedy can be
highly corrosive. Even those who no longer deeply feel other
people's suffering become prisoners of their own harrowing
anecdotes. Like Scheherazade in ``The Arabian Nights,'' we live for
only as long as our stories engage you.
 &HT;    So is Kosovo a ``good'' war for the media? The viewing
experience can feel like a session with a Sony Play Station
followed by a Bombing Tactics 101 seminar. And there are only so
many times you can watch an F-16 take off from Aviano before you
reach for the remote.
 &HT;    But in their favor, the Albanians make empathy-positive
refugees, and there is the added frisson of Russian saber rattling
just out of theater.
 &HT;    Although it's hard to imagine that their situation could be any
worse, in one sense the Kosovars are a lucky people. An accident of
geography has ordained that their fate, unlike that of so many,
many others who suffer in media silence, is relevant to our vital
interests.
 &HT;    And so for the moment at least, their cries are heard across the
world.

 FOR RELEASE: APRIL 25 or thereafter  
 By BLAINE HARDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Until Milo Djukanovic's new best friends in the United States
and Western Europe began to drop bombs on Montenegro in late March,
life had been going along swimmingly for the handsome young
president of this Yugoslav republic.
 &HT;    Just 37 years old, built like an NFL linebacker, packaged in
dark Italian suits, married to an attractive blonde and hailed by
voters as Milo the Blade, Djukanovic (djew-KAHN-oh-vich) has been
playing a deliciously wicked game of chicken with the Serbian
dictator Slobodan Milosevic.
 &HT;    Before bombs and cruise missiles began to rain on Yugoslavia,
the Montenegrin president even seemed to be winning.
 &HT;    For the first time since 1918, when Serbia annexed this
mountainous, Connecticut-size republic on the Adriatic Sea and
turned it into a perennial Yugoslav little brother, Montenegro was
moving toward an independent and democratic future linked to the
economies of Western Europe and the United States.
 &HT;    Milosevic, so tactically brilliant in using ethnic hate to
consolidate power, wasn't able to get a grip on the republic's
650,000 residents, even though he ruled 15 times as many people and
more than six times as much land and commanded the formidable
Yugoslav army.
 &HT;    The Montenegrin president has challenged Milosevic with an
impudent Balkan mix of populism, police muscle, cigarette smuggling
and wisecracks about Milosevic's wife. Instead of howling about
historical wrongs, whipping up nationalistic paranoia and ordering
ethnic cleansing, Milo the Blade has preached free-market
prosperity and eased ethnic tensions by securing the civil rights
of his republic's Muslim and Albanian minorities.
 &HT;    Although Djukanovic tested and taunted Milosevic, he took care
never to say or do anything anti-Serb. He never lost sight of who
had the tanks and stopped short of a direct confrontation that
could bring out the Yugoslav army.
 &HT;    Montenegro and Serbia are all that's left of the six republics
that once made up Yugoslavia. Under the federal Constitution, they
are supposedly equal, but larger Serbia has always dominated.
 &HT;    And Djukanovic has remained immune to Tin Pot Leader Syndrome, a
dizzying and endemic Balkan malady that infected his next-door
neighbor, Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, whose
nationalist swagger terrified the Serb minority and helped provoke
a war with Serbia.
 &HT;    Djukanovic is no choirboy. He started out in public life 10
years ago as a Communist enforcer for Milosevic. As one of the Serb
leader's handpicked henchmen in Montenegro, he developed a
state-sponsored air-and-sea smuggling operation that,
paradoxically, gave him the financial resources to slip free of
Milosevic's iron grip and evolve into a Balkan rarity _ a democrat.
 &HT;    The U.S. State Department says it believes Djukanovic's
conversion is real, and so do the handful of long-suffering
human-rights activists who have watched him rise to power. His
bully-boy past is unsavory, even criminal, they say, but he came of
age in a very bad Balkan neighborhood where smart democrats with
popular support and the guts (and police power) to stand up to
Milosevic are hard to find.
 &HT;    The region desperately needs a hero, and Djukanovic is perhaps
the one leader whom the West can rally around.
 &HT;    Yet NATO bombs have changed all that. They have belied
Djukanovic's promise to voters that a turn to the West would
produce peace and wealth. Instead, the bombs have emboldened his
enemies who, with Milosevic's conniving, have already tried to
overthrow his government by force.
 &HT;    Many Montenegrins now consider it cowardly and traitorous to
turn their backs on their embattled Serb neighbors. The bombs mean
that before this story is printed Djukanovic could be put in prison
or killed.
 &HT;    I met him in the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica late on a
night in early April. He was holed up inside the Presidency
Building, which was encircled by Special Forces police officers
wearing camouflage combat uniforms and Israeli-made body armor and
carrying Israeli-made automatic weapons.
 &HT;    After passing through the police gantlet, the metal detector and
the passport review, I was kept waiting for about half an hour in a
barren room with a single fluorescent tube that flicked on and off.
 &HT;    The president's office was nicer. The lights worked. The
curtains were heavy; the rug, plush. Out on the street, nearly all
of the police had been strikingly tall, dark and beefy. So was
Djukanovic. He was also immaculately turned out, considering the
hour and the circumstances, in a starched white shirt and dark blue
suit. His brown hair was freshly trimmed and just barely flecked
with gray.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, he spoke in the stiff bureaucratic locution of the
young Communist that he once was, larding his sentences with
references to ``interlocutors'' and ``democratic structures.'' But
after a few minutes of conversation I noticed that, unlike other
Balkan leaders, he answered questions directly, without taking off
on insufferably self-serving rants about how his people have been
wronged and misunderstood for centuries.
 &HT;    The NATO bombings, the West's campaign to force Milosevic to
halt his army's assault on ethnic Albanians in the Serb province of
Kosovo, had started 12 nights earlier. Some of the strikes have hit
Montenegro, where the Yugoslav army has outposts. Whatever effect
those bombings were having in Kosovo, they were an unqualified
disaster for the man standing in front of me.
 &HT;    Before the bombs, two elections had shown that, by a narrow
margin, Montenegrins approved of Djukanovic's shift to the West and
of his prickly criticism of Milosevic. Now, though, the president
did not bother pretending that he still had the support of his
people. The bombs have already remade politics here.
 &HT;    On the evening he received me, more than 20,000 Montenegrins had
gathered just four blocks from the president's office for a
``Muzicki Hepening'' in the city's central square. The rock
concert, the largest public gathering here in years, was organized
by the pro-Milosevic Socialist People's Party to protest the NATO
strikes.
 &HT;    The noisy crowd carried framed photographs of Milosevic and
posters that read, ``Monica Fell to Her Knees Before Clinton, But
We Won't!'' They applauded speeches that glorified the Yugoslav
army's campaign against the Kosovars. Many Montenegrins were
clamoring for the president's head.
 &HT;    ``Djukanovic is a traitor,'' said Dejan Cvijanovic, a
28-year-old computer technician. ``There are a great number of
people who voted for him who now have turned against him. I hope
there is a coup soon.'' Djukanovic had been hearing the same
belligerent stuff, he told me.
 &HT;    Hundreds of his police officers had watched the concert from the
edges of the square. He had monitored it from his office, and said
he was concerned about similar gatherings that were scheduled for
the coming week. I asked if he was afraid of Milosevic.
 &HT;    ``No,'' he said. ``But I have no illusions. As long as Slobodan
Milosevic is in the political life of Yugoslavia, he will do all he
can think of both against Montenegro and against myself.''
 &HT;    But predicting what Milosevic might or might not do has always
been a fool's game. If there were a confrontation in Montenegro,
where nearly every adult male owns a gun, it could easily escalate
into a dreadful civil war.
 &HT;    It was all so much simpler before the NATO bombs began falling,
Djukanovic kept telling me in his bunkered office. All he had to do
was outfox a dictator who, in the words of the last U.S. ambassador
to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmermann, is the ``slickest con man'' in
the Balkans.
 &HT;    The outfoxing began imperceptibly. Ten years ago, Djukanovic was
thought of _ if he was thought of at all _ as merely a young,
hard-line puppet of Milosevic. The Serb leader had plucked him from
the ranks of the League of Communists in Montenegro to help lead
something Milosevic called the ``antibureaucratic revolution.''
 &HT;    This was reform-sounding double talk for a power grab. Milosevic
pushed aside older Communists still loyal to Tito's version of
Yugoslavia, a place where Serb nationalism was crushed by the power
of the state. Djukanovic helped his Serbian mentor sweep away the
old gray cadres. In return, Milosevic crowned him in 1991 as prime
minister of Montenegro. Just 29, he was the youngest prime minister
in Europe.
 &HT;    The United Nations slapped economic sanctions on Yugoslavia in
1991 at the start of the Bosnian war. Djukanovic, an economist by
training and a pragmatist by nature, quickly figured out how to
profit from them. For a number of years, around 2 o'clock every
morning, several giant Russian-made transport planes landed at the
airport on the edge of the capital. The planes brought in American
and European cigarettes, which were trucked to the coast and
smuggled by boat to Italy.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's government imposed a ``transit fee,'' which,
according to Perovic, the foreign minister, added about $30 million
a year to the republic's coffers. That's not a lot of money by
European standards, but with an annual budget of just $270 million,
the Montenegro government was relying on smuggling for more than 10
percent of its revenue. (NATO bombing, of course, put an end to the
plane landings.)
 &HT;    Djukanovic funneled most of the money into government salaries
and pensions, which in the mid-1990s his government managed to pay
on time. At such budgetary games, he was more skilled than
Milosevic in Serbia, where pensions and salaries almost always ran
six to eight months late, despite equally rampant smuggling. While
Montenegrins widely believed that Djukanovic was creaming off some
of the profits, they didn't much care.
 &HT;    Unemployment was near 40 percent. A decade of war had ruined the
tourist industry. ``Everyone in Montenegro thought that finally
there was someone in government who knew how to create money,''
said Srdan Darmanovic, a former member of the Yugoslav Parliament
and a Montenegrin human-rights lawyer.
 &HT;    During these years, Djukanovic never said a disparaging word in
public about Milosevic, although he insisted in our interview that
he criticized him to his face in private meetings in Belgrade. Such
public loyalty, however, did not prevent members of the Milosevic
family from getting mad at Djukanovic, who was making money that he
wasn't sharing with them.
 &HT;    Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, attacked him in her weekly
newspaper column as the most notorious smuggler in Yugoslavia. It
was a bold and characteristically mendacious accusation. Her only
son, Marko, a gangster who carried a gun and routinely wrecked
expensive racing cars, ran a large cigarette, alcohol and fuel
smuggling operation in Serbia.
 &HT;    Playing to widespread resentment of Milosevic's wife, whom many
Montenegrins and Serbs regard as a low-wattage Stalinist shrew,
Djukanovic countered that she was an irrelevant woman whose
Chinese-oriented Marxist party, the Yugoslav United Left, was so
small that its entire membership could fit on a bus.
 &HT;    Djukanovic waited, however, until her husband seemed to be
losing power before announcing that he wasn't a fan of Milosevic.
In late 1996 and early 1997, when the Serbian leader was struggling
through three months of mass street demonstrations in Belgrade,
Djukanovic said that Milosevic was a politician of the past, that
he did not have a future in Yugoslavia and that Yugoslavia had no
future with him.
 &HT;    When I asked about the smuggling, Djukanovic vehemently denied
rising to power by illegality. Officials in his government, though,
openly concede that it was the only way to make ends meet under
sanctions. They said Djukanovic has tried to attract foreign
investment and legitimate business. Imitating post-Communist
leaders from Poland to Bulgaria, he has announced plans to sell off
state-owned industry. NATO bombings, of course, have put such
reforms on hold.
 &HT;    Besides building a financial power base, Djukanovic had to build
a political machine as well. He did this in a most un-Balkan way,
by advocating ethnic tolerance. The contrast with Milosevic was
nothing short of amazing.
 &HT;    As for Kosovo, Djukanovic has called Milosevic's campaign of
violent ethnic cleansing ``insane, autistic and autocratic.'' He
attributes the catastrophe there to what he has said were years of
neglect by the Serbian leader, during which he refused to negotiate
with moderate Kosovar politicians.
 &HT;    He told me that months before the NATO campaign began, he warned
Western governments that bombing would only make things far worse
for the Kosovars. He said he advised the West to support the
democratic opposition in Serbia and in Kosovo and to show some
patience.
 &HT;    Two nights after Djukanovic and I spoke, a few NATO bombs
exploded near Podgorica _ the first such attacks in Montenegro in a
week.
 &HT;    To find out why NATO was bombing there, I called Robert Gelbard,
the U.S. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, in Washington, who
was eager to explain. Gelbard said he had already been on the phone
that morning with Djukanovic, reassuring him that the bombings were
merely a response to the Second Yugoslav Army, which had fired a
land-to-air missile at NATO planes flying over Montenegro on their
way to Serbia. The strike was not part of a new offensive campaign.
 &HT;    ``From the very beginning of the air campaign, we knew _ and we
let Djukanovic know _ that there were certain minimal army targets
that we were going to have to hit in Montenegro,'' he said.
 &HT;    Gelbard then shifted conversation away from the awkward matter
of bombing his friend and talked about what the Clinton
administration was doing to help Djukanovic. It had just decided to
give the Montenegro government $10 million to help pay for
pensions, salaries and social programs. American money, via the
United Nations, was also helping to pay for the care of the
estimated 35,000 Kosovar refugees who have poured into the
republic.
 &HT;    In addition, he said, Washington had exempted Montenegro from
economic sanctions growing out of the crisis and was urging
Congress to approve large business loans for the area. And it was
training Montenegrin diplomats and granting American landing rights
to Montenegrin Airlines.
 &HT;    ``We don't support secession or independence for Montenegro,''
he said, ``but we do support what Djukanovic is doing. He has
support at the highest levels in this administration. His politics
and his economic policies are a good model for all of Yugoslavia
and a particularly good model for the opposition inside Serbia.''
But Washington, he added, had cut no deal to bail out Montenegro in
case Milosevic's loyal Yugoslav army attacks.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's game of chicken was still on.

 &HT;    Until Milo Djukanovic's new best friends in the United States
and Western Europe began to drop bombs on Montenegro in late March,

investment and legitimate business. Imitating post-Communist
leaders from Poland to Bulgaria, he has announced plans to sell off
state-owned industry. NATO bombings, of course, have put such
reforms on hold.
 &HT;    Besides building a financial power base, Djukanovic had to build
a political machine as well. He did this in a most un-Balkan way,
by advocating ethnic tolerance. The contrast with Milosevic was
nothing short of amazing.
 &HT;    As for Kosovo, Djukanovic has called Milosevic's campaign of
violent ethnic cleansing ``insane, autistic and autocratic.'' He
attributes the catastrophe there to what he has said were years of
neglect by the Serbian leader, during which he refused to negotiate
with moderate Kosovar politicians.
 &HT;    He told me that months before the NATO campaign began, he warned
Western governments that bombing would only make things far worse
for the Kosovars. He said he advised the West to support the
democratic opposition in Serbia and in Kosovo and to show some
patience.
 &HT;    Two nights after Djukanovic and I spoke, a few NATO bombs
exploded near Podgorica _ the first such attacks in Montenegro in a
week.
 &HT;    To find out why NATO was bombing there, I called Robert Gelbard,
the U.S. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, in Washington, who
was eager to explain. Gelbard said he had already been on the phone
that morning with Djukanovic, reassuring him that the bombings were
merely a response to the Second Yugoslav Army, which had fired a
land-to-air missile at NATO planes flying over Montenegro on their
way to Serbia. The strike was not part of a new offensive campaign.
 &HT;    ``From the very beginning of the air campaign, we knew _ and we
let Djukanovic know _ that there were certain minimal army targets
that we were going to have to hit in Montenegro,'' he said.
 &HT;    Gelbard then shifted conversation away from the awkward matter
of bombing his friend and talked about what the Clinton
administration was doing to help Djukanovic. It had just decided to
give the Montenegro government $10 million to help pay for
pensions, salaries and social programs. American money, via the
United Nations, was also helping to pay for the care of the
estimated 35,000 Kosovar refugees who have poured into the
republic.
 &HT;    In addition, he said, Washington had exempted Montenegro from
economic sanctions growing out of the crisis and was urging
Congress to approve large business loans for the area. And it was
training Montenegrin diplomats and granting American landing rights
to Montenegrin Airlines.
 &HT;    ``We don't support secession or independence for Montenegro,''
he said, ``but we do support what Djukanovic is doing. He has
support at the highest levels in this administration. His politics
and his economic policies are a good model for all of Yugoslavia
and a particularly good model for the opposition inside Serbia.''
But Washington, he added, had cut no deal to bail out Montenegro in
case Milosevic's loyal Yugoslav army attacks.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's game of chicken was still on.

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was a warm and sunny Saturday morning, the heart of the
Sabbath, and most of Jerusalem was shuttered _ except for a
second-floor corner suite in the King David Hotel, looking out over
the Jaffa Gate and the rough stone walls guarding the Old City.
 &HT;    Inside, the fax machine beeped, a cell phone trilled and Israeli
newspapers and campaign memos were scattered across the floor. An
easel displaying scribbled poll numbers was perched in a corner,
and dirty plates, half-filled coffee cups and wineglasses littered
the tables, the remnants of 12 hours of breakfast and dinner
meetings.
 &HT;    There was no sign on the door, but the suite served as the
headquarters for the re-election campaign of Benjamin Netanyahu,
the prime minister of Israel, if only for one reason: Arthur J.
Finkelstein, the Republican political consultant from the United
States, was in Jerusalem today, and this is where he was staying.
 &HT;    Finkelstein seemed tense and preoccupied as he opened the door
to his suite. Netanyahu's main opponent in the May 17 election, the
Labor Party candidate Ehud Barak, had recently announced on
television that, if elected, he would withdraw all Israeli troops
from Lebanon by the middle of 2000.
 &HT;    ``His secret plan to end the war in Lebanon _ it's absolutely
Nixon,'' Finkelstein says caustically as he pours a cup of coffee,
recalling Richard Nixon's 1972 promise to end the war in Vietnam.
Barak's pledge was sketchy, but coming at the end of an anxious
week in which three Israeli soldiers died in Lebanon, it had
captured the public's attention.
 &HT;    Even before he left the United States for Jerusalem, Finkelstein
had ordered the Likud campaign into action: It conducted a poll of
Israeli voters on Barak's pledge and his party's surprisingly vivid
suggestion that Netanyahu was ``stuck in the Lebanon mud.''
 &HT;    The results were waiting for Finkelstein when he checked into
the King David. By a margin of ``better than 2 to 1,'' Finkelstein
says, voters saw the Barak declaration as politics as usual. This
finding guided the response Netanyahu and Finkelstein scripted that
weekend.
 &HT;    The prime minister would not even pretend to address the issue
directly, but would instead attack the character of his opponent
for raising it, underscoring what Netanyahu wants to be the
campaign's central question: Which of these two men is tough and
steady enough to assure Israel's survival?
 &HT;    Over the course of the weekend they drafted the slogan, ``Ehud
Barak: Too Many Ambitions, Too Few Principles.'' By Monday morning
_ with Finkelstein back in the United States _ those words would be
posted on the wall of Netanyahu's party headquarters, published in
his newspaper advertisements and incorporated into the daily
talking points that guide his cabinet ministers' conversations with
Israeli reporters.
 &HT;    Finkelstein did not know it, but the attack he was responding to
that weekend was largely the handiwork of another American
political consultant, one he has never met and does not
particularly admire, but who is also working in Israel this spring
_ none other than James Carville.
 &HT;    Carville had flown to Tel Aviv two weeks earlier to join Bob
Shrum _ one of two other Washington consultants working for Barak _
to present the American recommendations on how the Labor Party
challenger could boost his struggling campaign.
 &HT;    Seize control of the daily debate, said the Americans _
Carville, Shrum and Stanley Greenberg, who was President Clinton's
pollster in 1992 and is Barak's pollster now. Speak in short,
declarative sentences and jettison the bulky arguments that had
been the quaint mainstay of Israeli political dialogue. Every
interview, every speech, must include a fundamental assault on
those parts of Netanyahu's record where three months of polling had
found voters' reservations to be most pronounced.
 &HT;    ``Netanyahu,'' said Carville, ``is stuck.'' He was stuck on the
economy, stuck on the peace process, stuck in how he ran his
government. And ... stuck in the Lebanon mud.
 &HT;    American consultants have been flying in and out of Israel since
Prime Minister Menachem Begin called in David Garth of New York in
1981, playing a low-key (and not particularly significant) role in
how campaigns are conducted. But this year's contest _ which many
politicians think will most likely be decided by no more than a
percentage point or two and seems sure to result in a June 1 runoff
_ is different.
 &HT;    Sound bites, rapid response, repetition, wedge issues, ethnic
exploitation, nightly polling, negative research, searing attack
advertisements on television _ the familiar tools of American
elections have now arrived in the Middle East. The 1999 contest for
prime minister of Israel is providing a stage for a struggle
between the seminal Democratic and Republican consultants of the
past 15 years, the principal architects of what has become the
signature American style of political discourse _ one that rewards
simplicity over complexity, shock over substance and Election Day
victory over governing and nearly everything else.
 &HT;    (The third major candidate in the Israeli race, Yitzhak
Mordechai of the new Center Party, has not retained his own
American consultant for one reason, an aide said: He can't afford
it.)
 &HT;    The evidence of the Americans' influence piles up with each
passing campaign day. An Israeli news cycle hardly ever goes by now
without Barak describing Netanyahu's government as ``stuck,'' as
Barak tries to anchor the election in domestic and economic issues.
Or without Netanyahu calling Barak a ``leftist'' or weak, as
Netanyahu for a second time presents himself as the candidate best
able to assure Israel's security.
 &HT;    Both sides' attacks are the products of exhaustive surveys and
focus groups. The orientation of Barak's campaign staff even
includes a viewing of ``The War Room,'' the 92-minute documentary
that glorified the tactical inner workings of the 1992 Clinton
campaign. Carville flew in to officiate after the Barak war room
opened in a nondescript office building in southern Tel Aviv.
 &HT;    Finkelstein, Carville, Shrum and Greenberg are treated as
something of celebrities in Israel, almost as likely to end up on
the front pages of the local newspapers as the candidates. In this
environment, should it really come as such a surprise to learn that
the less-than-telegenic Barak has started to bring a makeup artist
with him on his campaign trips? Or that in assailing Netanyahu,
Barak has invoked the line ``too many lies for too long'' _ the
very same slogan that Democrats in the United States used so
successfully last fall against another Finkelstein client, Alfonse
M. D'Amato?
 &HT;    In America, the notion of politics as spectacle may be
distasteful and dispiriting to watch, but it is hardly a threat to
the Republic. Israel, however, is a young and still somewhat
tentative nation _ Finkelstein was 2 years old when the independent
State of Israel was founded in 1948 _ and it is embarking on only
its second direct election of a prime minister.
 &HT;    It's a place where teachers snap a gun onto their waistbands for
protection before taking children on an outing in the country, and
where shoppers carrying knapsacks are routinely searched going into
a supermarket to make sure they're not about to deposit a bomb next
to the cereal boxes.
 &HT;    It's a place where citizens flick on the radio every hour to
hear if a soldier they know has been killed in Lebanon, and
animosity between Jew and Jew _ between the Sephardim and the
Ashkenazi, between the secular and the religious _ can be as raw as
that between Arab and Jew.
 &HT;    In Israel, the pace of the impending election can be measured by
the rise in random stabbings around the Jewish and Muslim quarters
of Jerusalem.
 &HT;    Israel is, in short, a nation that passes most of its days right
on the edge _ riding 4,000 years of religious, ethnic and tribal
turmoil. The American consultants describe this overstimulated and
chronically anxious environment as more intense than any they have
worked in before. Elections here are literally fought over
life-and-death issues, and so it is that many Israelis are coming
to believe that something disturbing is happening to their
political system this spring.
 &HT;    Yaron Ezrahi, a professor of political science at Hebrew
University, says the new style of campaigning has created ``a
distorted and irrelevant form of politics'' _ an unhappy and
increasingly prevalent view of the new Israeli political landscape
that would certainly sound familiar to anyone who has followed the
evolution of American elections.
 &HT;    ``Because of the Americanization of the campaign, it boils down
to slogans instead of to substance,'' says David Bar-Illan, a
former editor of The Jerusalem Post who is Netanyahu's director of
communications. ``And nothing is more typically American than
boiling down issues to slogans and really almost emptying them of
meaning.''
 &HT;    When Finkelstein arrived in Israel in 1996, his knowledge of the
country's politics amounted to ``what the average readers of The
New York Times would know in New York,'' says Eyal Arad, who was a
senior Netanyahu adviser at the time. It is an assessment that
Finkelstein neither disputes nor apologizes for. ``Look, it doesn't
matter if I get it or not,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``If I go to Iowa, they'll say: 'How can you understand Iowa?
You're from New York.' And I'll say: 'I don't need to understand
Iowa. That's not the point. That's not what I do.' You find the
intersections of interests _ you take a survey, you find out what
people care about, you find out what your candidate cares about,
you find the intersection of those two points, and that's what you
talk about. What difference does it make if I understand it or
not?''
 &HT;    That said, Finkelstein did spend five weeks of his 18th year
working on a kibbutz near Jerusalem and shares the emotional
identification many American Jews have with the country's struggle
for existence. ``I understood that being Jewish meant that we were
always at the edge of extinction as a people,'' Finkelstein says.
 &HT;    ``And survival was a fundamental quest in the Jewish person. The
reason that Israel was important was because it was a place for
Jews to survive. It was a place for Jews to go. And remember, I'm
very much a product of the postwar mentality, of the movie
'Exodus': There needs to be a place to go. And this was the
place.''
 &HT;    By contrast, Carville is Roman Catholic and has not, he says,
made any particular effort to tutor himself on Israel's history and
politics in preparation for this job. ``The Israelis understand
their history better than anyone else,'' Carville says, settling in
for a nightcap by the dying embers of a fire at his Virginia
farmhouse one January evening.
 &HT;    ``No one is going to say, 'Give me a 500-word essay on the
causes, the strategies and the long-range results of the '67 war,
the '73 war.' That's just not what's important. I mean, it's
important but it's not important to my role. They are not looking
to me for advice on Israel. They are looking to me for advice on
communications, on organizations, on how to set things up, on how
to respond.
 &HT;    ``You've got to be careful,'' Carville adds. ``I think in a
campaign or a situation like this, when everyone else knows so
much, I think there's a point in politics where knowledge becomes a
burden.''
 &HT;    The consultants also are not around all that much. Finkelstein
came to Israel about six times in 1996, usually staying for two or
three days on each visit, which amounts to barely twice the hours
he spent on his commute.
 &HT;    Carville has spent far less time in Israel than his Barak
employees would like, as he juggles a presidential race in
Argentina, a demanding television and speech schedule and rearing
two young children with his wife, Mary Matalin, the Republican
consultant _ who is, yes, a Netanyahu supporter.
 &HT;    Greenberg, meanwhile, is swimming in the transcontinental
demands of his political portfolio. ``I have the Scottish elections
on the sixth of May,'' he said over breakfast after arriving in Tel
Aviv from London in late February.
 &HT;    ``I've got this election on the 17th of May. I've got the South
African elections, whose date is not firm, but whose date is either
May 23 or May 29. In Britain, I've got the European elections and
local council elections on June 1. And I've got the runoff here.''
 &HT;    By American standards, the consultants are not paid a huge
amount of money considering the time it takes just to get to work.
In the United States, consultants typically get a percentage of
campaign money expended on television advertising, a figure that in
a big race can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
 &HT;    In Israel, Finkelstein says, he is paid $4,000 a month; Barak's
campaign manager, Tal Silberstein, says the three American
consultants will collect $400,000 among them for their work in
Israel.
 &HT;    The traveling-salesman image of these consultants shapes the way
they are perceived in Israel, and not necessarily for the better.
Yet no one would suggest that Israel is above the intellectual
compromises and ideological shortcuts that are arguably the price
for democratic elections.
 &HT;    And tactics such as sound bites on television obviously work,
according to Uri Dromi, who was the chief spokesman for the
governments of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. But, he adds, they
inevitably worsen the daily struggle to govern a nation ``where the
issues are so crucial, where everything is so serious, where
everything touches the existence of the country. It is bad for the
kind of discourse we have in this country.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Israel has crossed a threshold this spring, and it
is not likely to abandon the television screen to return to the
stuffy meetings and public harangues of a few years ago. ``I think
the market for American consultants will expand before it
contracts,'' Netanyahu says; it is a future that both he and Barak
say they applaud.
 &HT;    For now, anyone who finds this observation distressing can
console themselves with the thought that one way another, a
prominent American consultant will lose an election in Israel next
month.

 FROM: Prospect Magazine  
 &HT;    For me, the final straw was Huairou. Not everyone will remember
Huairou, but some of us will never forget it.
 &HT;    Huairou was the Chinese village which in 1995 was transformed
for a few days into a sea of tents, huts, makeshift wooden walkways
and mud, when more than 20,000 women from around the world met
there for the United Nations' fourth world conference on women.
 &HT;    For sheer color, the occasion was not to be missed. Saudi women
covered in black jostled with American feminists wearing ``Why have
sex when you can have gender?'' T-shirts. Workshops on
``stereotyping and sexism in advertising'' (sponsored by the
Montreal Council of Women) were held a few feet away from tents
where Cambodian peasant women in national dress were sewing a quilt
in honor of the conference. Tanzanian women sold brightly-colored
scarves; Singaporean women distributed fresh flowers, ``flown here
courtesy of Singapore Airlines''; the American Association for the
Advancement of Science was answering questions about teaching
science to girls.
 &HT;    Just occasionally, the different worlds were forced into awkward
confrontation.
 &HT;    At a workshop entitled ``Politics of difference: single women,''
a few Third World women turned up expecting to talk about
prostitutes, and the pressures on women in traditional societies to
marry the men of their families' choice. An articulate Indian woman
stood up and gave a moving speech about shelters which she had
organized for women who run away from their violent husbands, and
are subsequently shunned by communities which simply do not
recognize the right of women to live alone.
 &HT;    A few Americans turned up at the meeting too to talk about the
difficulty of living alone in Philadelphia (``People, like, think
you're lesbian''). Throughout the workshop, the two sides listened
to one another in incomprehending silence.
 &HT;    Most of the time they didn't bother to listen to each other at
all. The Africans were talking about clean water and basic
education for girls. Women from Islamic countries were arguing
about whether to wear veils. The Americans were talking about
``breaking the glass ceiling,'' and the French about the literary
significance of ``the Other.''
 &HT;    I left Huairou filled with admiration for a handful of brave and
energetic women from developing countries; and filled with cynicism
about most of the women who had trekked to China from the west. The
former had many real causes to fight for; most of the latter were
indulging in the false belief that a cause called ``feminism''
still exists.
 &HT;    Like most women of my age and background, I grew up in the 1970s
taking feminism for granted. It was just a good cause like other
good causes, to be supported without much criticism. But I also
grew up without really understanding the nature of the revolution
which had already been carried out by previous generations of
women. I always assumed, for example, that I would grow up and get
a job. Everyone around me _ my parents and teachers _ assumed that
I would grow up and get a job too. This wasn't a matter of ``having
a career'' as an entertaining accompaniment to having a family. I
would have a job for the same kinds of reasons that the boys I knew
would have jobs: for financial security, professional satisfaction
and so on.
 &HT;    This was an assumption, not necessarily spoken aloud. But it was
supported by a series of legal changes _ some quite recent, some
dating back nearly a century: changes in property law, electoral
law, divorce law, education law and employment law. In my
generation, women had the same choices and faced the same
constraints as men. A good marriage was no longer the only form of
advancement.
 &HT;    This did not mean that women were the same as men. This meant
that women in the United States and parts of western Europe were
treated similarly to men by the legal system, as employers or
employees, voters, property-owners, drivers of cars, users of birth
control or purchasers of mortgages and health insurance. Not
everybody might be able to take advantage of this equality: Women
are limited by economics and by social constraints, just like men.
Nor did reality always match the letter of the law. Women were not
always able to achieve in practice what they could in theory, just
like men. But equality existed on the statute books, ready to serve
as the basis for legal challenges and complaints.
 &HT;    The most important battle had been won _ and the war itself was
over. It may have been fashionable, when I was growing up, to call
oneself a feminist. But it was pointless: Beyond legal equality,
there was little _ and there still is little _ that women's
politics can achieve.
 &HT;    Of course not everyone realized that this was the end. In the
1980s, the death of feminism had already become an established
excuse for public hand-wringing. There was talk of ``backlash'' and
the rise of an ``anti-woman'' right. Much of the argument in the
United States focused on the right to abortion, which had never, in
the past, been central to the women's movement.
 &HT;    Yet for all the appearance of falling interest and a reversal of
values, there was no more a need to mourn the ``death'' of feminism
than there was a need to mourn the passing of iron washing boards.
Feminism was finished because it was no longer necessary. By the
time I started working, most people seemed to understand this _
except for the small group of women who continued to call
themselves feminists.
 &HT;    I realize that it is unfair to categorize them. Modern feminists
differ, and not everyone who calls herself a feminist is even
political in the strictest sense. ``Feminists'' now include
environmentalists, activist Christians, networking businesswomen,
academics with a special interest in women writers and _ as we know
from a thousand parodies _ lesbian separatists. Many of these,
however, are women acting together in small groups in order to
pursue, perfectly reasonably, the special interests which they
happen to have in common.
 &HT;    Yet in addition to these various special interest groups, there
also exists a community of women who go on identifying themselves
as mainstream feminists, and continue to argue about what that
implies. Some of the more prominent are journalists; others teach
at universities; and still others are ordinary women who continue
to follow the debate and strive to apply feminist principles to
their own lives.
 &HT;    In general, they are easy to recognize because they continue to
operate more or less within the same paradigm that advocates of
women's rights operated within 40 years ago, a paradigm
suffragettes would have recognized too. Most perceive women as
economically and politically weaker than men; most assume that all
women are affected by this imbalance in more or less the same way;
most argue that this imbalance can be rectified, using the legal
system _ and that all change in this direction is necessarily
progressive.
 &HT;    Most, in other words, continue to behave as if the two great
legal revolutions of the early 20th century and the 1970s had not
taken place. They continue to portray women as if they were all
alike, and all victims: metaphoric victims of the fashion industry
or the market economy; literal victims of predatory bosses or
husbands; victims who are unable to fight back, who have no
self-esteem, who are unable to make use of existing laws to defend
themselves and thus need ``quotas'' and other privileges.
 &HT;    What seems particularly sad, however, is that modern feminists
seem, most of the time, uninterested in providing realistic answers
to the genuine dilemmas that women now face as the result of their
revolutionary change in status.
 &HT;    Legal equality and the mass movement of women into the workforce
have created a host of family crises. High rates of divorce, with
obvious consequences for children and the elderly, reflect the
stresses caused by this massive change, as well as the changing
balance of power between men and women. At the same time, legal
equality has not yet brought with it changes in male (and female)
attitudes which make it easy for women to work with men on equal
terms.
 &HT;    Many men still do not want to work for women, or even to hire
women _ and when they do, they retain fixed ideas of what women can
and cannot be promoted to do, or of how much they should be paid. A
deep dislike of working women often lurks beneath the surface of
even the most apparently enlightened of men.
 &HT;    I remember a conversation with a retired newspaper editor who
told me that his single biggest problem was the inconvenience
caused by women who took maternity leave. If that was a problem, I
replied, then he shouldn't really have hired any women at all. ``I
know,'' he sighed wistfully, ``but you're not allowed to say
that.''
 &HT;    No wonder many women are still tormented by insecurities about
their jobs, or are plagued by the feeling that they are unable to
balance the demands of children and careers. Yet for most of the
past 40 years, mainstream feminism has had little to say about
working women and families. Most of the time feminists have been
profoundly uninterested in the problems of motherhood _ and
husbands _ in general.
 &HT;    From Betty Friedan, whose main concern was to get housewives out
of the house, to Naomi Wolf, who advises women to network their way
into positions of power, most feminists (American feminists in
particular) have been more interested in what women can achieve on
their own, rather than with men.
 &HT;    Worse, the assumptions of mainstream feminism tend to obscure
the actual problems faced by actual women. Working women with
children, for example, are generally not victims, but rather people
struggling to find some way to balance a lot of different concerns.
Nevertheless, mainstream feminism persists in seeing them as
equally downtrodden and equally oppressed, even when the evidence
is otherwise. Certainly they are not victims of their husbands, who
are often worse-off.
 &HT;    One of the conclusions of a 1997 Demos survey of women, for
example, was that mothers and fathers now have far more in common _
in terms of attitudes, anxieties, politics _ than mothers and
single women. Likewise, working men and working women have more in
common than women who work and women who don't work. Women with the
money to hire nannies have different problems from women on
welfare. The study concluded that feminism was still necessary. I
conclude the opposite.
 &HT;    I also conclude that those who are interested in the economic
and social issues of these various groups would do much better to
detach themselves from feminism before trying to think about
solving them. The difficulties faced by female part-time workers
should be discussed in the context of part-time work, not of
feminism. The ways in which the tax system discriminates against
those who hire domestic help should be discussed in the context of
tax law, not of feminism. Even childcare issues are really linked
to other employment and benefit issues.
 &HT;    As for the persistence of various forms of male prejudice,
female insecurity and imbalances in relations between employees and
employers _ I can see no solution except the passage of time.
Government simply cannot force people to change their behavior,
however offensive. Short of importing squads of Political
Correctness thought police, there is no way to change attitudes
using the legal system. Yet this does not mean that nothing will
ever change _ things are changing, very quickly.
 &HT;    It is odd, in fact, how much feminists underestimate the impact
on attitudes which working women can have, simply by their presence
in the workplace. By doing their jobs well, women encourage men to
hire other women. By becoming managers, editors, chairmen and
foremen, women put themselves in a position to hire other women.
Through demonstrating competence and reliability, women already
find it easier than men to get certain kinds of factory and
clerical jobs.
 &HT;    Already, there are professions in which the presence of women is
actually required. In fact, there is no newspaper editor, anywhere,
who can afford not to have women writers.
 &HT;    In the meantime, women are not the only ones to be hired or
fired according to their looks or their background; it is not only
women who feel frustrated because they cannot achieve what they
want. It is not only women who are given an education too narrow to
help them in the real world; it is not only women who lack role
models or mentors. On the contrary _ 40 years ago, it was possible
to argue that women started their working lives in a worse position
than men. Now it is possible, in many parts of the world, to argue
the opposite.
 &HT;    I repeat: I know that there are different kinds of feminists.
But why is it that, when I close my eyes and think about the
western feminists whom I encountered en masse in Huairou, I want to
tell them to wake up, to look at what has already happened in the
world; to stop talking about me and the women I know as victims,
stop describing the men I know as oppressors, stop pretending that
nothing has happened over the past century?
 &HT;    The era of organized women's politics is over. Legal equality
has been achieved. Now we must revive some of the older values that
were lost in the process.
 &HT;    Feminism is dead, a victim of female success _ can we please now
stop mourning its demise.

 FROM: Prospect Magazine  
 &HT;    For me, the final straw was Huairou. Not everyone will remember
Huairou, but some of us will never forget it.
 &HT;    Huairou was the Chinese village which in 1995 was transformed
for a few days into a sea of tents, huts, makeshift wooden walkways
and mud, when more than 20,000 women from around the world met
there for the United Nations' fourth world conference on women.
 &HT;    For sheer color, the occasion was not to be missed. Saudi women
covered in black jostled with American feminists wearing ``Why have
sex when you can have gender?'' T-shirts. Workshops on
``stereotyping and sexism in advertising'' (sponsored by the
Montreal Council of Women) were held a few feet away from tents
where Cambodian peasant women in national dress were sewing a quilt
in honor of the conference. Tanzanian women sold brightly-colored
scarves; Singaporean women distributed fresh flowers, ``flown here
courtesy of Singapore Airlines''; the American Association for the
Advancement of Science was answering questions about teaching
science to girls.
 &HT;    Just occasionally, the different worlds were forced into awkward
confrontation.
 &HT;    At a workshop entitled ``Politics of difference: single women,''
a few Third World women turned up expecting to talk about
prostitutes, and the pressures on women in traditional societies to
marry the men of their families' choice. An articulate Indian woman
stood up and gave a moving speech about shelters which she had
organized for women who run away from their violent husbands, and
are subsequently shunned by communities which simply do not
recognize the right of women to live alone.
 &HT;    A few Americans turned up at the meeting too to talk about the
difficulty of living alone in Philadelphia (``People, like, think
you're lesbian''). Throughout the workshop, the two sides listened
to one another in incomprehending silence.
 &HT;    Most of the time they didn't bother to listen to each other at
all. The Africans were talking about clean water and basic
education for girls. Women from Islamic countries were arguing
about whether to wear veils. The Americans were talking about
``breaking the glass ceiling,'' and the French about the literary
significance of ``the Other.''
 &HT;    I left Huairou filled with admiration for a handful of brave and
energetic women from developing countries; and filled with cynicism
about most of the women who had trekked to China from the west. The
former had many real causes to fight for; most of the latter were
indulging in the false belief that a cause called ``feminism''
still exists.
 &HT;    Like most women of my age and background, I grew up in the 1970s
taking feminism for granted. It was just a good cause like other
good causes, to be supported without much criticism. But I also
grew up without really understanding the nature of the revolution
which had already been carried out by previous generations of
women. I always assumed, for example, that I would grow up and get
a job. Everyone around me _ my parents and teachers _ assumed that
I would grow up and get a job too. This wasn't a matter of ``having
a career'' as an entertaining accompaniment to having a family. I
would have a job for the same kinds of reasons that the boys I knew
would have jobs: for financial security, professional satisfaction
and so on.
 &HT;    This was an assumption, not necessarily spoken aloud. But it was
supported by a series of legal changes _ some quite recent, some
dating back nearly a century: changes in property law, electoral
law, divorce law, education law and employment law. In my
generation, women had the same choices and faced the same
constraints as men. A good marriage was no longer the only form of
advancement.
 &HT;    This did not mean that women were the same as men. This meant
that women in the United States and parts of western Europe were
treated similarly to men by the legal system, as employers or
employees, voters, property-owners, drivers of cars, users of birth
control or purchasers of mortgages and health insurance. Not
everybody might be able to take advantage of this equality: Women
are limited by economics and by social constraints, just like men.
Nor did reality always match the letter of the law. Women were not
always able to achieve in practice what they could in theory, just
like men. But equality existed on the statute books, ready to serve
as the basis for legal challenges and complaints.
 &HT;    The most important battle had been won _ and the war itself was
over. It may have been fashionable, when I was growing up, to call
oneself a feminist. But it was pointless: Beyond legal equality,
there was little _ and there still is little _ that women's
politics can achieve.
 &HT;    Of course not everyone realized that this was the end. In the
1980s, the death of feminism had already become an established
excuse for public hand-wringing. There was talk of ``backlash'' and
the rise of an ``anti-woman'' right. Much of the argument in the
United States focused on the right to abortion, which had never, in
the past, been central to the women's movement.
 &HT;    Yet for all the appearance of falling interest and a reversal of
values, there was no more a need to mourn the ``death'' of feminism
than there was a need to mourn the passing of iron washing boards.
Feminism was finished because it was no longer necessary. By the
time I started working, most people seemed to understand this _
except for the small group of women who continued to call
themselves feminists.
 &HT;    I realize that it is unfair to categorize them. Modern feminists
differ, and not everyone who calls herself a feminist is even
political in the strictest sense. ``Feminists'' now include
environmentalists, activist Christians, networking businesswomen,
academics with a special interest in women writers and _ as we know
from a thousand parodies _ lesbian separatists. Many of these,
however, are women acting together in small groups in order to
pursue, perfectly reasonably, the special interests which they
happen to have in common.
 &HT;    Yet in addition to these various special interest groups, there
also exists a community of women who go on identifying themselves
as mainstream feminists, and continue to argue about what that
implies. Some of the more prominent are journalists; others teach
at universities; and still others are ordinary women who continue
to follow the debate and strive to apply feminist principles to
their own lives.
 &HT;    In general, they are easy to recognize because they continue to
operate more or less within the same paradigm that advocates of
women's rights operated within 40 years ago, a paradigm
suffragettes would have recognized too. Most perceive women as
economically and politically weaker than men; most assume that all
women are affected by this imbalance in more or less the same way;
most argue that this imbalance can be rectified, using the legal
system _ and that all change in this direction is necessarily
progressive.
 &HT;    Most, in other words, continue to behave as if the two great
legal revolutions of the early 20th century and the 1970s had not
taken place. They continue to portray women as if they were all
alike, and all victims: metaphoric victims of the fashion industry
or the market economy; literal victims of predatory bosses or
husbands; victims who are unable to fight back, who have no
self-esteem, who are unable to make use of existing laws to defend
themselves and thus need ``quotas'' and other privileges.
 &HT;    What seems particularly sad, however, is that modern feminists
seem, most of the time, uninterested in providing realistic answers
to the genuine dilemmas that women now face as the result of their
revolutionary change in status.
 &HT;    Legal equality and the mass movement of women into the workforce
have created a host of family crises. High rates of divorce, with
obvious consequences for children and the elderly, reflect the
stresses caused by this massive change, as well as the changing
balance of power between men and women. At the same time, legal
equality has not yet brought with it changes in male (and female)
attitudes which make it easy for women to work with men on equal
terms.
 &HT;    Many men still do not want to work for women, or even to hire
women _ and when they do, they retain fixed ideas of what women can
and cannot be promoted to do, or of how much they should be paid. A
deep dislike of working women often lurks beneath the surface of
even the most apparently enlightened of men.
 &HT;    I remember a conversation with a retired newspaper editor who
told me that his single biggest problem was the inconvenience
caused by women who took maternity leave. If that was a problem, I
replied, then he shouldn't really have hired any women at all. ``I
know,'' he sighed wistfully, ``but you're not allowed to say
that.''
 &HT;    No wonder many women are still tormented by insecurities about
their jobs, or are plagued by the feeling that they are unable to
balance the demands of children and careers. Yet for most of the
past 40 years, mainstream feminism has had little to say about
working women and families. Most of the time feminists have been
profoundly uninterested in the problems of motherhood _ and
husbands _ in general.
 &HT;    From Betty Friedan, whose main concern was to get housewives out
of the house, to Naomi Wolf, who advises women to network their way
into positions of power, most feminists (American feminists in
particular) have been more interested in what women can achieve on
their own, rather than with men.
 &HT;    Worse, the assumptions of mainstream feminism tend to obscure
the actual problems faced by actual women. Working women with
children, for example, are generally not victims, but rather people
struggling to find some way to balance a lot of different concerns.
Nevertheless, mainstream feminism persists in seeing them as
equally downtrodden and equally oppressed, even when the evidence
is otherwise. Certainly they are not victims of their husbands, who
are often worse-off.
 &HT;    One of the conclusions of a 1997 Demos survey of women, for
example, was that mothers and fathers now have far more in common _
in terms of attitudes, anxieties, politics _ than mothers and
single women. Likewise, working men and working women have more in
common than women who work and women who don't work. Women with the
money to hire nannies have different problems from women on
welfare. The study concluded that feminism was still necessary. I
conclude the opposite.
 &HT;    I also conclude that those who are interested in the economic
and social issues of these various groups would do much better to
detach themselves from feminism before trying to think about
solving them. The difficulties faced by female part-time workers
should be discussed in the context of part-time work, not of

those who hire domestic help should be discussed in the context of

to other employment and benefit issues.
 &HT;    As for the persistence of various forms of male prejudice,
female insecurity and imbalances in relations between employees and
employers _ I can see no solution except the passage of time.

 By MIKE WISE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    As he stepped from a black stretch limousine in front of a
modest Milwaukee house in January, Dave Checketts, the president of
Madison Square Garden, knew a lot was riding on the interview he
was about to conduct.
 &HT;    Just how much, it would later turn out, he couldn't fully
understand.
 &HT;    Joined by Ernie Grunfeld, then the Knicks' president, their
coach, Jeff Van Gundy, and another team executive, Checketts was
there to gauge the character of Latrell Sprewell.
 &HT;    A three-time All-Star guard, Sprewell had been on furlough ever
since attacking his coach with the Golden State Warriors, P.J.
Carlesimo, the year before, choking him, threatening to kill him
and, 20 minutes later, returning to the gym to punch him.
 &HT;    Both Grunfeld and Van Gundy wanted Sprewell badly, but if
Checketts was going to gamble on the National Basketball
Association's most prominent pariah, he needed to know more, and
not just about Sprewell's celebrated assault but also about a
strange 1994 incident in which one of Sprewell's pit bulls bit off
the ear of his 4-year-old daughter.
 &HT;    Sprewell had refused to put the dog to sleep until the 10th and
final day of its quarantine and, when questioned by reporters, had
airily dismissed the episode, saying, ``Stuff happens.''
 &HT;    Checketts questioned Sprewell closely about the incident. ``I
have six kids, and I know how I feel about them,'' Checketts said
that day. ``And I don't expect everyone to feel for their kids the
way I feel for mine. But I have to get something off my chest and
ask, 'Why would you say that?'''
 &HT;    Sprewell answered the question in two parts, first picking up a
framed picture of his daughter and handing it to Checketts.
 &HT;    ``I love my daughter dearly,'' he said. ``I took care of her
plastic surgery, it didn't affect her hearing and I've never had
anything hurt me more in my life.''
 &HT;    He also had an explanation for the ``stuff happens'' remark. ``I
was tired of the press crawling all over me. I didn't want them to
go to the hospital.''
 &HT;    ``He was not indignant,'' Checketts said. ``He was not
defensive. I believed what he was telling me.''
 &HT;    Four months after that Jan. 17 visit, Checketts scans his memory
for something else that stood out, something else that persuaded
him to give Sprewell an opportunity to resume his career after a
13-month layoff, how a meeting barely lasting 90 minutes could
alter his perception.
 &HT;    ``I'd have to say, 'Footprints in the Sand,''' Checketts says,
recalling a familiar poem etched in a mirror inside the doorway of
Sprewell's home. It's about a deceased man looking back on his life
and remembering that there were always two sets of footprints in
the sand.
 &HT;    ``The man confronts the Lord about only remembering one set of
footprints in his deepest, darkest moments,'' Checketts says. ``'My
son,' the Lord replies, 'it was during those times I carried you.'
It was deeply personal for me at different points in my life.''
 &HT;    Staying behind for a few minutes as the rest of the Knick brain
trust shuffled back to the limousine, Checketts asked Sprewell,
``That's an appropriate verse for you, don't you think?''
 &HT;    Sprewell nodded.
 &HT;    ``Do you ever think about it?''
 &HT;    ``Oh, many, many times.''
 &HT;    ``Does it mean anything to you?''
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' Sprewell replied. ``I know I've been carried.''
 &HT;    Returning to his home in New Canaan, Conn., that night,
Checketts asked his family for advice. ``You know what kind of
stuff I would take at school if we got him, Dad?'' asked one of his
sons. ``Are we really going after him?''
 &HT;    Checketts also questioned his own values, wondering what
credibility he would have if he acquired Sprewell. (Checketts, a
Mormon who came to New York via Bountiful, Utah, had once said he
would never have Dennis Rodman on his team.)
 &HT;    His two youngest sons thought Sprewell deserved a second chance,
which got the other one thinking again. ``You think he could help
us win?'' His father nodded.
 &HT;    ``Look, I did not lead the family in prayer to ask God whether
we should take Latrell Sprewell,'' Checketts says. ``And it wasn't
like a light turned on in my head. But I felt I understood the man
a lot better. The visit we had with him convinced me it would
work.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    In basketball, before a big game, it is not uncommon to
experience ``butterflies.'' Your stomach churns and you hope your
surging adrenaline carries you those first few minutes until you
calm down and find symmetry and purpose in the way you play.
 &HT;    But as Knicks' fans, players and management have come to
understand, there is neither purpose nor symmetry in Sprewell's
game. It's more of an avant-garde jazz riff, played at high speed
and with little discernible logic. And for the Knicks' management
and coaches, the anxiety never goes away.
 &HT;    They tried to tap into Sprewell's psyche that January day but
forgot to ask whether he could cope with coming off the bench,
rather than playing with the starting team. They went in search of
personal character and walked right past team chemistry. Their goal
was a noble one _ to transform a good player on a bad team into a
great player on a championship team. They never imagined that that
player could take a good team and play a major role in turning it
into a very bad one.
 &HT;    But somewhere over the last few months, Sprewell managed that
feat, pulling the Knicks into his world _ an enigmatic one, in
which he gets his points, his team loses and everyone wonders why a
once-proud franchise is on the brink of missing the playoffs for
the first time in 12 years.
 &HT;    He stands in the middle of the chaos and uncertainty,
irredeemable after all _ but not for the reasons that Checketts and
the Knicks feared.
 &HT;    Sprewell, the player who has never seen a shot he didn't like,
who glowers at teammates when they don't pass him the ball, who
forgets defensive assignments at crucial moments, is actually more
harmful to a team than Sprewell the supposed human hand grenade in
high-tops.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, it hasn't worked out like everybody had hoped,'' he
says, sitting inside his locker cubicle after a recent loss to the
Toronto Raptors. ``Maybe I'll be here next season, but you never
know. Things change quickly in this league.''
 &HT;    Indeed. On April 21, the day Sprewell's agent complained
publicly that a rift between Grunfeld and Van Gundy was hurting the
team, Checketts dismissed Grunfeld and took over the team himself.
(One of his first acts was to fine Sprewell $25,000 for allowing
his agent to speak out.) And those are just the casualties off the
floor.
 &HT;    On the court, it is surreal to watch him go one-on-nine, using
his teammates and opponents as pylons. Surreal and sad. For
whatever redemptive qualities Sprewell has, they have yet to emerge
on the floor.
 &HT;    His talent can be mesmerizing. At Golden State, where Sprewell
established himself in some people's eyes as the second best
shooting guard in the league, behind Michael Jordan, his
explosiveness and production masked his liabilities.
 &HT;    He played defense with passion and fire. On offense, at a sinewy
6 feet 5 inches, he could dart through defenses, either getting to
the basket for a layup or stopping abruptly to nail a long jumper.
 &HT;    In a league enamored of great one-on-one players, he looked like
the real deal, the guy who could break down a defense
single-handedly. For the Knicks, who have a long history of looking
for (and never finding) that one great player to put alongside
Patrick Ewing and produce a championship, Sprewell seemed like the
answer.
 &HT;    Yet, had they looked closer, Knick officials might have noticed
disturbing signs. After one playoff season, in 1994, the Warriors
began to implode. Trades and losses mounted, and so did Sprewell's
frustration. He feuded and fought with teammates. A self-described
loner, he lost his senses on Dec. 1, 1997, an incident that
catapulted him into the role of America's Thug.
 &HT;    ``He fits the perpetrator to a 'T,''' says Spike Lee, sitting in
his courtside seat at the Garden, his No. 8 Sprewell jersey peaking
out from beneath his jacket. ``The corn rows. The scowl.
Everything. People would think he's another thug the NYPD has to
protect us from. What's interesting, though, is he's very
articulate.''
 &HT;    When you speak to Sprewell, you see no rage, no contempt for
authority. He is intelligent and engaging. But his comments and
actions, on the court and off, tend to confirm your worst thoughts
about him.
 &HT;    The laughing after losses. The failure to pass the ball to an
open man. And, particularly, those out-of-touch remarks.
 &HT;    In late March, for example, Van Gundy began to wonder seriously
whether Sprewell cared about winning.
 &HT;    On March 27, during a practice, the coach coolly called Sprewell
aside to talk about something he had said in a column I wrote the
night before. Van Gundy specifically mentioned a passage in which I
had asked Sprewell whether it bothered him that the Warriors and
Knicks were a combined 7-22 with him in the lineup over the last
two seasons.
 &HT;    Sprewell's response was: ``That's just one of those stats. That
doesn't bother me.''
 &HT;    Van Gundy questioned Sprewell on a vacant, dark stairwell as the
Knicks shot baskets and reporters anxiously hovered about 20 yards
away. If the concerned coach wanted a better answer, the nonchalant
player wanted to know why Van Gundy had made a power play in front
of the press.
 &HT;    ``I think if he had do it over again, I think he'd give a
different answer,'' Van Gundy said soon after. ``It's not a valid
stat? Every player has to be concerned first and foremost with
winning. That is going to be their legacy in this league. He would
probably like to have a do over on that.''
 &HT;    A few days later, I asked Sprewell if he would like to clarify
or add to that statement.
 &HT;    ``No, I said what I said and I meant it,'' he said. ``I didn't
think what I said was that big a deal. I don't know why Jeff had to
say anything to me about it. Basketball is supposed to be fun,
right?''
 &HT;    You get the sense that sometimes he just does not get it, that
the reason Sprewell is such a polarizing force has nothing to do
with a nasty disposition or a conscious desire for confrontation _
and everything to do with Spree-ality.
 &HT;    Conventional reality: You sacrifice to win.
 &HT;    Spree-ality: You balk at coming off the bench, rather than
starting, and make sure your agent informs the news media about the
grave injustice taking place.
 &HT;    Conventional reality: You put the choking incident behind you.
 &HT;    Spree-ality: Since, down deep, you feel you committed no crime,
you pursue a racially based lawsuit against the team and the league
_ a suit that a federal judge has twice rejected.
 &HT;    Conventional reality: You complete an anger-management course,
if for no other reason than to send the right message.
 &HT;    Spree-ality: You blow off the sessions, calling it all a joke
and insisting you don't have a problem.
 &HT;    One odd quirk about Sprewell is his penchant for gravitating to
the youngest players on the team. At Golden State, Sprewell, now
29, hung out with an impressionable rookie, Joe Smith, and the
young equipment manager, Shane Salazar. In New York, Marcus Camby,
25, and Rick Brunson, 26, became his frequent dinner companions.
 &HT;    From the beginning, Sprewell had trouble adjusting on the floor.
Yet never did he seem more out of place than the night of April 7
in Charlotte, N.C. Speaking before the game, he said: ``People have
written stuff, but I'm not bringing anybody down. I'm not making
other people play poorly. I don't know what I'm doing that's so
bad.
 &HT;    ``I mean, you know, at this point, they're not accustomed to
having seasons like this. Everybody has to come up with a reason
why we're playing badly. So, obviously, it's Latrell's fault.''
 &HT;    Hours later, after a 24-point drubbing by the moribund Charlotte
Hornets _ the Knicks' fifth loss in seven nights _ Ewing said he
could not recall a more depressing night in his 15-year Knick
career. Rumors of Van Gundy's demise crackled through the press
room.
 &HT;    Sprewell? He looked around and wondered why all the sad faces.
``Being in sixth place with 15 games left, that's a lot of time,''
he said, unaware that the Knicks were actually in 10th place. ``We
don't have a lot of time, but we have enough time to make a run
here. So I'm not throwing in the towel yet. I know we're down, but
we got to get over it. You can't stay down. That's the attitude I
have.''
 &HT;    When someone intoned, ``You seem kind of unfazed by all that's
taken place,'' Sprewell shrugged his shoulders.
 &HT;    ``I've played on losing teams before,'' he said. ``I know what
it takes. A lot of these guys haven't experienced times like this,
and I have. We can't think championship right now. I think we have
to take it game by game and think: 'Hey, let's get in. And let's
build on that.' I've said it before. I don't see the elite teams in
the East being that much better than us, especially when we're
playing well.''
 &HT;    Whatever his intention _ and no one seriously doubts his concern
for the team's fortunes _ Sprewell sounded like some wise old sage,
saying something to the effect of: ``I can lead you. We're on my
turf. We're losing. The unpromised land is near. Let me take you
there.''
 -0 
 &HT;    During a recent visit to Oakland, a player on last season's team
will show you where the incident took place, five floors above the
Oakland Convention Center, on the Warriors' practice floor. How
they traded words and, in a moment of fury, Sprewell grabbed
Carlesimo around the throat, changing his career forever.
 &HT;    And yet, after all the discussion about the altercation, you
forget it began with someone telling Sprewell what to do on a
basketball court. Unlike his previous coaches, who let Sprewell
freelance without conscience, Carlesimo wanted more team play.
Specifically, he wanted Sprewell to make better passes during a
drill.
 &HT;    He doesn't like living up to obligations imposed on him by
others. He has thrived whenever people let him do what he wanted to
do. It's as if, approaching 30, he is still in his Terrible Twos.
Sprewell lives and plays in his own universe, undermining structure
and reason.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Having spent Easter in northern Italy with the sound of NATO
bombers screaming overhead, I travelled back to Sweden through
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   There, a number of retired generals were speaking out. One of
them, Gerd Schmueckle, was wounded six times on the Russian front
during World War II, but then served in the highest positions
inside NATO. And he warned of a new fascination with war. Perhaps,
he said, it is a question of generations. When the war veterans are
losing their hair and teeth, and disappearing into homes for the
elderly, the new generation suddenly has a different attitude
toward war.
</P>
<P>
   For Schmueckle, war was associated with horror beyond
imagination, leaving deep psychological scars on individuals and
nations. Bombs, he said, do not create peace; instead, they breed
hatred for years, perhaps for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Younger politicians believe that they can fight new types of
wars. And these new wars are becoming increasingly popular. Indeed,
they are now conducted a couple of times a year. They are supposed
to be clean wars: high-rhetoric, high-altitude and high-technology
wars; smart bombs for smart politicians. The ``third way'' in war.
</P>
<P>
   These smart wars can be used to beef up diplomacy when it runs
into problems which seem too complicated. But they can also be used
to replace diplomacy entirely and just express the outrage that we
feel over evil regimes doing evil things.
</P>
<P>
   It's evil, isn't it? No one can really defend the outrageous
acts of a Saddam Hussein or a Slobodan Milosevic. Well then, it
can't be wrong to bomb them.
</P>
<P>
   So in the West, we are in the strange situation that instead of
cashing in our peace dividend, we are on the verge of running out
of cruise missiles, or at least the air-launched version. The smart
wars are beginning to take their toll on war stock.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with these smart wars conducted from the air is that
they are often difficult to relate to political objectives, and so
far have not proved a great success in achieving those objectives.
In Baghdad, there are no longer any U.N. inspectors to look for
weapons of mass destruction, but Saddam Hussein is still there.
Wasn't it supposed to be the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the aim of the smart war was to keep the Albanians in
Kosovo and get rid of Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. So far, it
has turned out to be the other way around. The air war against
Yugoslavia has not prevented a humanitarian catastrophe; rather, it
has become associated with one.
</P>
<P>
   The air war against Serbia will not only be a war over the
future of Kosovo, but also a war over the future of smart wars and
the use of air power in isolation. If Milosevic throws in the towel
and agrees to all the NATO demands, smart wars will be here to
stay, to be used whenever diplomacy runs into too many
complications.
</P>
<P>
   But if the air war turns out to be a prolonged phase of wanton
destruction and humanitarian disaster preceding a reluctant
decision by NATO to mount a ground offensive against Kosovo (and
take responsibility for a long-term occupation of part of the
Balkans), the future of smart wars will be very different.
</P>
<P>
   We are now seeing the refighting of the war of words over the
use of air power in the Bosnian conflict. In that war, Washington
was always arguing that a few volleys of cruise missiles and
strategic strikes would sort out the problem, while others argued
that this would only aggravate the situation on the ground and
worsen the plight of exposed civilians and U.N. peace-keeping
troops.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the emotional debate about the responsibility
for the massacre of Muslims after the fall of the U.N.-declared
safe area of Srebrenica in July 1995 turned on whether it was NATO
or the United Nations which had prevented air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   This presumes that air strikes could have stopped the Serb
soldiers marching in. In Kosovo, massive NATO air strikes have
clearly done nothing to prevent or limit the Serb onslaught on the
Kosovo Albanians. It certainly felt nice to see the good missiles
heading for their evil targets. But one day we may discover that
the massacres in Kosovo during the days and nights when NATO was
striking from the sky were even worse than the terrible war crimes
in Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   We must learn again the lessons of war and power; we must
painfully start to reread the classics such as Clausewitz and all
those who learned about war and power the hard way. Perhaps there
are no smart wars, even in our smart age.

<P>
   Since the alternative is too horrible to contemplate, let us
assume that before long NATO succeeds in imposing its will on
President Milosevic, with or without the use of ground troops, and
that a kind of peace has descended on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to remember is that it is not only Kosovars who
have suffered as a result of Milosevic's murderous drive for a
Greater Serbia. As a consequence of his policies, hundreds of
thousands of Serbs have also been expelled from lands which their
forefathers have occupied for centuries in Croatia, Bosnia and no
doubt now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these people will conclude, as the Germans did 50 years
ago, that they must pay the price for following a deluded leader,
and learn to live within diminished boundaries. But it is more
likely that they will conclude that once again they have been the
victims of a historic injustice, and that they will brood in
bitterness, waiting to launch yet another futile attempt to reverse
the verdict of history.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the future tranquillity of the Balkans, the Serbs
will have to be brought back into the international community as
equal members.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the consequences go much wider than the Balkans
alone.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, NATO will be profoundly affected even in victory.
There were two main arguments about NATO enlargement. One argument
was that NATO would remain a purely defensive alliance, and that
those who remained outside had nothing to fear. The other was that
NATO would now acquire a new role: to promote human rights,
democracy, good government and market economics inside Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was never clear how a military organization could promote
civilian objectives. But the ultimatum which NATO delivered to
Serbia _ and the war which has followed it _ means that it can no
longer be portrayed as a purely defensive alliance. And many are
wondering where it will stop.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could gain or lose. Before the crisis, most Russians were
as ignorant of what was happening in Kosovo as most Westerners. If
Prime Minister Primakov's bid to act as a broker in the peacemaking
succeeds, he will boost the prestige of Russia as well as of
himself. But many in the West regard Russia as an irritating
irrelevance. Relations between Russia and the West could spiral
downward.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members have been surprisingly united in support of
military action. Milosevic's policies left them no decent choice.
But NATO has turned out to be a very blunt instrument. Even if a
halfway decent settlement is now cobbled together for Kosovo, it
will be more difficult to get people to support a repetition of the
trick in another European crisis. And America is now likely to find
it harder to get European support for the idea that NATO should
extend itself beyond this continent, to help maintain the peace
wherever it is threatened, and punish villains wherever they are
found.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the biggest question of all: the nature and the
future of U.S. global power. Americans believe that they have a
duty to slay dragons. But the record _ in Vietnam, in Iraq, in
Iran, in Somalia, even in neighboring Cuba _ demonstrates that
there are severe practical limitations even to the most awesome
military power, especially when it is exercised in the belief that
technology can substitute for body bags.
</P>
<P>
   All our relationships are likely to be more edgy as a result of
what has happened. NATO's identity crisis and trans-Atlantic
recrimination are likely to intensify, even as the Europeans wonder
whether they will ever be able to organize a peaceful continent
without external assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Countries such as India or China, which do not share the U.S.
view of its own role, will become more inclined to join in
resisting U.S. demands. Sooner or later America too will have to
adapt to an imperfect world. But there is a danger of going too
far, and retreating into sullen isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a glum prospect. Because there are no simple, cheap or
satisfying solutions, we will have to go for complex and boring
ones.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should abandon its wilder pretensions to set the rest of
the world on a right moral course. It should concentrate instead on
its basic function as a defensive alliance and expand its network
of partnerships with non-members. In Europe, the main, and most
successful body for the promotion of peace, prosperity and
democratic rights in Europe, is not NATO but the European Union. It
should give practical aid and political support to the countries
most immediately affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
includes Russia, should become the main pan-European agency for the
resolution of political disputes between its members.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the much despised United Nations. Of course
the U.N. cannot solve all, perhaps not even many, of the world's
problems. Of course it provides no basis for starry-eyed optimism
about universal peace and world government. But despite its
numerous failures, it is the only comprehensive, law-based body
which exists for the purpose of settling political disputes among
its members.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of
the 1990s, while the Permanent Members of the Security Council
still took one another seriously, it functioned as its founders had
intended. The theory which has recently gained currency _ that if
the United Nations cannot agree then the United States and its
allies have the right and the duty to take action on their own _ is
arrogant, subversive of the rule of law, and unattractive to a lot
of people.
</P>
<P>
   However inconvenient, it is time for the Western powers to try
once more to make the United Nations work.

will have to be brought back into the international community as
equal members.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the consequences go much wider than the Balkans
alone.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, NATO will be profoundly affected even in victory.
There were two main arguments about NATO enlargement. One argument
was that NATO would remain a purely defensive alliance, and that
those who remained outside had nothing to fear. The other was that
NATO would now acquire a new role: to promote human rights,
democracy, good government and market economics inside Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was never clear how a military organization could promote
civilian objectives. But the ultimatum which NATO delivered to
Serbia _ and the war which has followed it _ means that it can no
longer be portrayed as a purely defensive alliance. And many are
wondering where it will stop.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could gain or lose. Before the crisis, most Russians were
as ignorant of what was happening in Kosovo as most Westerners. If
Prime Minister Primakov's bid to act as a broker in the peacemaking
succeeds, he will boost the prestige of Russia as well as of
himself. But many in the West regard Russia as an irritating
irrelevance. Relations between Russia and the West could spiral
downward.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members have been surprisingly united in support of
military action. Milosevic's policies left them no decent choice.
But NATO has turned out to be a very blunt instrument. Even if a
halfway decent settlement is now cobbled together for Kosovo, it
will be more difficult to get people to support a repetition of the
trick in another European crisis. And America is now likely to find
it harder to get European support for the idea that NATO should
extend itself beyond this continent, to help maintain the peace
wherever it is threatened, and punish villains wherever they are
found.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the biggest question of all: the nature and the
future of U.S. global power. Americans believe that they have a
duty to slay dragons. But the record _ in Vietnam, in Iraq, in
Iran, in Somalia, even in neighboring Cuba _ demonstrates that
there are severe practical limitations even to the most awesome
military power, especially when it is exercised in the belief that
technology can substitute for body bags.
</P>
<P>
   All our relationships are likely to be more edgy as a result of
what has happened. NATO's identity crisis and trans-Atlantic
recrimination are likely to intensify, even as the Europeans wonder
whether they will ever be able to organize a peaceful continent
without external assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Countries such as India or China, which do not share the U.S.
view of its own role, will become more inclined to join in
resisting U.S. demands. Sooner or later America too will have to
adapt to an imperfect world. But there is a danger of going too
far, and retreating into sullen isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a glum prospect. Because there are no simple, cheap or
satisfying solutions, we will have to go for complex and boring
ones.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should abandon its wilder pretensions to set the rest of
the world on a right moral course. It should concentrate instead on
its basic function as a defensive alliance and expand its network
of partnerships with non-members. In Europe, the main, and most
successful body for the promotion of peace, prosperity and
democratic rights in Europe, is not NATO but the European Union. It
should give practical aid and political support to the countries
most immediately affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
includes Russia, should become the main pan-European agency for the
resolution of political disputes between its members.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the much despised United Nations. Of course
the U.N. cannot solve all, perhaps not even many, of the world's
problems. Of course it provides no basis for starry-eyed optimism
about universal peace and world government. But despite its
numerous failures, it is the only comprehensive, law-based body
which exists for the purpose of settling political disputes among
its members.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of
the 1990s, while the Permanent Members of the Security Council
still took one another seriously, it functioned as its founders had
intended. The theory which has recently gained currency _ that if
the United Nations cannot agree then the United States and its
allies have the right and the duty to take action on their own _ is
arrogant, subversive of the rule of law, and unattractive to a lot
of people.
</P>
<P>
   However inconvenient, it is time for the Western powers to try
once more to make the United Nations work.

A PRODDING TO CHECK RAPID GLOBALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT L. TURNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE LEXUS AND THE OLIVE TREE 
Understanding Globalization 
By Thomas L. Friedman 
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 394 pp., $27.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a stock car enthusiast at Daytona, Thomas L. Friedman has
watched globalization move faster than anyone imagined just a few
years ago. The Iron Curtain has come down, the Internet has gone
up, world financial markets have exploded in both volume and
velocity. Even Africans far up remote rivers have cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lexus and the Olive Tree'' describes these developments
with the enthusiasm of a sportswriter, most of it positive.
Globalization can help improve the standard of living, and
human-rights standards as well, for many millions of people
worldwide. In Friedman's view, it even promotes peace because the
world marketplace is raising the cost of making war.
</P>
<P>
   But there are dangers, too. Friedman carries a handful of yellow
caution flags: unfettered markets could despoil the environment
worldwide; fast-paced economies widen the income gap between rich
and poor; galloping globalization threatens to homogenize ancient
cultures. Yet Friedman only waves these flags occasionally,
suggesting that careful application of ``filters'' can limit the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   But Friedman largely ignores the giant red flag bulging in his
pocket. Worrisome factors are noted, including the facts that bad
investments can pull down good ones globally, and that the speed of
markets now can stampede rational response. Friedman asserts that
the dominoes now are financial rather than political, yet he gives
meager attention to the possibility of collapse. Perhaps he feels
that the Asian and Russian debacles _ devastating to millions in
those countries but felt only modestly here _ represent the worst
that can be expected. But the biggest difference between Friedman's
view and stock car racing is that globalization is continuing to
accelerate with no end in sight. It doesn't even slow down at the
corners.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Friedman just received another demonstration of this
himself. Books about fast-moving current events are intrinsically
risky. Friedman and his publisher did the best they could with an
accelerated production schedule; the book quotes material published
as recently as this January. Still, ``Lexus'' was dated by the time
finished copies were arriving in the bookstores. A pivotal section
describes the qualities that define a country's economic power and
potential. The assessment is based on the opinions of the top
executives from the firm named by Forbes magazine last year as the
best-managed company in America: Compaq Computer. Faster than you
can press the Cancel Execute key, these heavily quoted executives
are gone from Compaq, sacked by directors last month after
disappointing earnings. Still, the coup at Compaq illustrates more
than it undercuts a recurrent theme of Friedman's: Global
competition weeds out laggards with no remorse, and with
breathtaking speed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Friedman's story describes the tension between the
Lexus, representing speed, technology and world markets, and the
olive tree, representing stationary, age-old values. Friedman's
inclination is clear: ``Tip O'Neill was wrong,'' he says. ``All
politics isn't local _ not anymore. All politics is now global.''
Friedman is persuasive in describing the inevitability of
globalization; more attention could be focused on preventing it
from trampling important values.
</P>
<P>
   Other books on globalization have been and will be produced by
persons better schooled in macroeconomics or world diplomacy. But
Friedman may be the best possible writer to provide this overview
at this time. A veteran New York Times reporter who won two
Pulitzer Prizes for work in the Middle East, he is now
foreign-affairs columnist for the Times. Like ``From Beirut to
Jerusalem,'' which won him the National Book Award in 1988, this
book is a lively mix of anecdote and analysis, with dozens of
interviews full of solid reporting from all over. Perhaps it is
true, as Friedman suggests, that he has eaten at a McDonald's in
more countries than any other person alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding Globalization,'' the book's subtitle, is
partilly apt. As a guide to the questions raised by globalization,
Friedman is eager, provocative, often entertaining, occasionally
insightful. Anyone seeking answers, however, must keep looking.
Friedman offers a first-rate description of the starting grid, and
the first few squealing movements, of a race that will be long,
fast and uncertain.

WAR BRINGS BOOM IN ALBANIAN ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Like most Albanian men, Dokliat has two guns _
an assault weapon and a pistol _ and he has the critical family and
communist-era secret police connections to back them up. His four
gold rings match his two gleaming bracelets, setting off his
expensive-looking sleek black suit.
</P>
<P>
   A full 24 hours with Dokliat, a professional bodyguard, will
cost you $300, which in edge-of-the-war Albania is a coldly
calculated investment: Travelers to the mafia-controlled north of
the country are almost certain to be robbed by one of the feuding
gangs of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Dokliat brings along hand grenades and other weaponry for the
ride north _ munitions he boasts he's never had to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find a lot of bodyguards in Albania, because everybody
has a gun, so they can say, `I'm a bodyguard,' '' Dokliat said,
waving off the pretend-protectors. But it's Dokliat's school ties
that set him apart; many of the official and unofficial armed men
who stop cars on Albania's poorly constructed roads are his former
classmates at secret police training. ``Everybody knows me,'' he
boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling with its own poverty and lack of development, Albania
has found a boom industry with the arrival of NATO troops and the
threat of a war spilling over its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Students whose parents live on less than $100 a month are making
that in a day, translating for journalists and international
organizations. Families subsisting on two-digit monthly salaries
are camping out in relatives' homes, renting their own apartments
for $100 to $300 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers now charge $200 to $300 to take people north, while a
private helicopter company will take five passengers for $1,200,
saving the passengers six hours in travel time each way. Bodyguards
charge $100 to $300 daily, not including a car.
</P>
<P>
   Not that getting a car is a problem. Albania is Europe's poorest
nation, with virtually no functioning legitimate economy and a
third-world infrastructure. But buying a late-model Mercedes-Benz,
BMW, or Jeep Grand Cherokee is a breeze at the makeshift vehicle
sales lot on Albania's western coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are thief cars,'' said a man in the lot who described
himself as a professional driver. Asked the fee for a Volkswagen
Golf, the man said, ``You want one? I go to Germany tomorrow. No
problem. I bring it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of vehicles on the lot indeed look suspicious, with
their Italian, German, and Swiss license plates still screwed on.
Cars ``with documents'' cost more, one salesman said, and the
others ``can't go out of Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   The stretch of road where the car lot is located defines
Albania, a throwback nation in the heart of modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There is the suspect car lot full of luxury vehicles, on a road
so beat up the cars won't last long if driven on them. The white
stucco houses on the hill across the street are barely standing,
and are too small for the shoeless children and weathered-looking
adults who inhabit them.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately next door to the car lot is the headquarters for
Albania Force, a humanitarian branch of the NATO operation against
Yugoslavia. The base, too, sits on the Adriatic sea, a beach that
could be a world-class resort if the Albanian government had the
means to clean up the sewage.
</P>
<P>
   The whole country has a feeling of being occupied. The roads are
taken up by aid trucks and huge vehicles carting heavy weaponry.
NATO soldiers cruise around the streets in green military vehicles,
and have virtually taken over the Rinas airport area.
</P>
<P>
   Long isolated, poor, and malfunctioning, Albania may find its
most promising role yet as that of the potential staging ground for
a NATO assault on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albanians, even though they feel really bad about what's
happening, still feel the beginning of a new era for Albania,''
said Dashi Peza, a businessman whose translation, logistics, and
hotel services are currently overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the presence of NATO will be very productive. For
some Albanians, this period of war has been very beneficial,'' Peza
said.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits, however, have largely gone through the black
economy, or what Arben Malaj, a member of Parliament and former
finance minister, calls ``the informal economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The cash-strapped Albanian government, already saddled with the
most severe economic and developmental troubles in the region,
still is not being reimbursed adequately for its housing of Kosovar
refugees, Malaj said.
</P>
<P>
   Malaj estimated that the refugees will cost the Albanian
government $200 million if the crisis lasts the year; just $100
million in direct aid has been promised. The impact of the refugees
on the education, health, water, and energy systems is also heavy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of NATO, and the potential improvement of the
infrastructure that may come with a long-term stay by the troops,
``will be, I guess, exploited for good,'' Malaj said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, always skittish about putting money into
unstable Albania, were scared off completely after the disastrous
pyramid schemes of 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every Albanian family sank all their money into the
phony get-rich-quick schemes, and most lost everything. The crisis
led to mass riots and the looting of Albania's military arsenals
for weaponry _ munitions that have made for a well-armed populace.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Albania is still ``a mess,'' Peza said.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is an accepted condition here. Locals say a job
working as a customs officer goes for as much as $18,000. That's
not the salary, they say; that's the price an Albanian has to pay
as a bribe to get the job, on the presumption that the employee
will make that much and more by demanding fees from people bringing
things into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of money changing hands in Albania, but few people
seem to be actually working. Illegal money-changers flap their wads
of local lek at passersby on Skanderbeg Square, right under the
eyes of local police.
</P>
<P>
   Fake visas to Greece, where an estimated 300,000 Albanians go to
find under-the-table work _ go for $300 to $800, locals say,
leaving little incentive for the buyer or seller to earn money
legitimately in Albania, where the average monthly income is $106.
</P>
<P>
   Armed banditry in the north is common; an AP television crew,
robbed of $250,000 in cash, equipment, and vehicles, was offered it
back _ for $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny Western Union office downtown has a guard outside
controlling the crush of people who go there every business day to
collect money. Nearly every Albanian family has at least one family
member working abroad and wiring money home, said economist Fatmir
Mema _ one explanation of how Albanians are able to eat, when
unemployment is 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's presence may bring cash, international attention, and
some sense of order to Albania, some here say, improvements that
could help make the tiny nation more like its European neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial benefit may well be worse in the long term for
Albania, which needs to shed its dependency economy and develop on
its own, Mema said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, NATO's presence is positive. In other ways, it
is a disaster,'' Mema said. ``Albania needs work and investments _
not aid. The destiny of Albania is not now in the hands of
Albanians.''

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So Robert Kraft says he's going to keep the Patriots in the
Boston area. Hartford is livid at having been seduced and
abandoned. Stony with anger is John Rowland, the 41-year-old
Connecticut governor who put his career on the line for Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting questions are unanswered. They have to do with
whether the National Football League enforced its interest by
threatening to put another team in the Boston area if the Patriots
moved out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows the official story. As Kraft wrote last week to
the governor, ``Unfortunately, we have not seen sufficient evidence
to give us adequate assurance that the planned Hartford stadium can
be ready for the beginning of the 2002 season on the terms we
contemplated in our agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people know too, that NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue took
an interest in the decision, to the extent of asking lawyer Paul
Kirk (a former aide to Senator Edward M. Kennedy who served for a
time as chairman of the Democratic National Committee) to take a
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Those who read Globe columnist Will McDonough know also that
Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney played a key role. As
president of the Ireland Fund, Rooney is well-acquainted with the
Boston businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A panel led by the Rev. Donald J. Monan, chancellor Boston
College, was duly formed, to forge consensus among legislative
leaders, including House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, Senate
president Thomas F. Birmingham, Governor Paul Cellucci, and Boston
Mayor Thomas M. Menino.
</P>
<P>
   The state's offer of an infrastructure package was marked up to
around $70 million (from its original $57 million) and set against
Connecticut's offer of a $375 million stadium and a dizzying series
of guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Kraft turned down the richest deal ever
negotiated by an owner for a publicly financed stadium _ worth more
than $1 billion over 30 years _ and accepted instead what columnist
McDonough described as ``just about the worst any owner has had to
accept to stay put in the National Football League.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Kraft says he had a change of heart. What isn't
known is the extent to which he figured he could lose it all by
leaving. Did the league threaten to put an expansion team in Boston
if the Patriots left?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reasonable speculation,'' says Andrew Zimbalist, a
Smith College economist who is an expert in the economics of
sports. ``It could have happened two ways. There could be an
explicit threat, as in, `We don't like to expand, we don't want to,
but if someone brings an antitrust action, we might be forced to.'
'' Even without some explicit threat, he says, ``the existence of
the problem was unavoidable.'' In other words, the shadow of
Cleveland hung over the deal.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1996 that Art Modell moved his Cleveland Browns to
Baltimore and changed their name to Ravens in exchange for a
tax-built stadium, after Cleveland repeatedly refused to foot the
bill. An outraged Cleveland fan base quickly elicited an NFL
promise of an expansion team. The new Cleveland Browns will kick
off this summer. Billionaire Alfred Lerner paid $530 million for
the franchise. The sum was split evenly among the other 28 owners,
minus Modell.
</P>
<P>
   Could a Hartford-based Kraft have antagonized sufficiently the
coalition of 23 owners that would be required to authorize an
expansion team for Boston? It's possible.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the enormous profits that he contemplated from
the move would have been mainly his alone, ticket revenues
guaranteed by Connecticut taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   NFL teams pool most of their advertising revenues. Boston is the
nation's sixth-largest market; Hartford is 27th. Thus Kraft's gain
would have been every other owner's loss. Also, a Patriots team in
Harford inevitabley would cut into the business from the two New
York-area teams, the Giants and Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Modell, of course, moved his team far enough from Cleveland that
it didn't matter what the NFL did back home. But the value of
Kraft's franchise in Hartford would have been killed by a new
Boston team _ although the legislature had guaranteed his profits
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Did the panel assembled by Monan serve to remind Kraft of the
seven enthusiastic bidders who showed up afer the Cleveland
franchise was authorized? Surely the answer is yes. Kraft may have
ceased to be a whining millionaire. But he is certainly is no
public hero.

WHAT'S NEW AT SOUTHLAND AMUSEMENT PARKS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The galaxy is in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Humanoids are hurled down slippery cliffs. Strange creatures
zoom by on powerful skates, ducking, diving and flying through the
air. Lasers explode over once-peaceful lakes. Cyborgs and their
killing machines patrol a frightened populace.
</P>
<P>
   A sneak peak at the new ``Star Wars'' film?
</P>
<P>
   Nope, just summer at the local theme parks _ namely Universal
Studios Hollywood, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Disneyland, Knott's
Berry Farm and Raging Waters _ as new rides, spills and attractions
gear up to take a bite out of the summertime blues.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, you can grab your lightsaber and get in line with
other Jedi fans to see George Lucas' latest extravaganza before
anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   But we'd rather splash down on the Wedge, a watery free-fall
that sends riders over the edge of a 50-foot slope set 100 feet
above Raging Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Or we might check out the futuristic ``Terminator 2: 3D,'' a
heart-pumping virtual adventure combining live-action stunts and
state-of-the-art technology that opens Thursday at Universal.
</P>
<P>
   The parks clearly hope business picks up after last year's
slump, caused partly by El Nino, the effects of the Asian financial
crisis and changing demographics.
</P>
<P>
   But some places are apparently in a kind of Force-field holding
pattern, perhaps aware that for many families this summer, a day
out is going to mean a trip to the local multiplex to see ``Star
Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Disneyland, for example, isn't unveiling anything enormous but
is offering a batch of new attractions in a revamped Tomorrowland.
One addition called Innoventions allows visitors hands-on access to
current technologies in an array of interactive games, devices and
exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Knott's is aiming squarely at the kiddies this season with
``Snoopy's Extremely Cool Summer,'' a parkwide celebration of
family entertainment, including daredevil skate demonstrations, a
slapstick stunt musical, an on-ice parade and elaborate laser show.
</P>
<P>
   The park opened its white-knuckle wooden coaster GhostRider six
months ago, along with Supreme Scream, a descending thrill ride
that also happens to be Orange County's tallest structure.
</P>
<P>
   Summer at Magic Mountain is also one for the pint-size set. The
park has renovated its six-acre interactive Bugs Bunny World
featuring a host of rides, activities and a petting zoo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Valencia park splashes into summer with
Hurricane Harbor, a tropical-themed waterpark with almost two-dozen
slides and attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The wet stuff, of course, is Raging Waters' !ital!raison
d'etre!off!. Out in San Dimas, the tropically landscaped oasis
boasts rides, slides and that new uphill Wedge, which opens
Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Shaped like an extreme sports half-pipe, the versatile Wedge
towers 50 feet above the park, hurling riders down a slippery
vertical drop only to propel them up to the opposite edge and back
_ up to eight times _ at speeds up to 40 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other water ride has so much choice about how you
experience it,'' says Raging Waters general manager Kent Lemasters.
``Riders can challenge themselves to experience different
combinations of speed, direction and position.''
</P>
<P>
   The attraction allows thrill-seekers the choice of riding solo,
double or triple on inner tubes that can be boarded frontward,
backward or sideways for a free-falling ride.
</P>
<P>
   Think speed, think splash; wear bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's ``Terminator 2: 3D,'' created by ``Titanic''
writer-director James Cameron, boasts the world's largest 3-D
screen along with explosive live action. The 12-minute film, a
sequel to Cameron's Oscar-winning ``Terminator 2: Judgment Day''
thriller, is set in 2029 in Los Angeles, part of a world policed by
evil cyborgs.
</P>
<P>
   To save humanity, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong _
reprising their roles from the original film _ take on an evil
corporate behemoth and its army of deadly machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do something spectacular,'' Cameron said.
``There's an enhanced sense of reality that comes from the
high-resolution 65mm film format we chose, mixed with the illusion
of depth offered by 3-D.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Magic Kingdom's now-open Innoventions, guests board a
``loading pod'' where a robotic host introduces the Anaheim
attraction's five thematic areas: Transportation, Health &AMP; Fitness,
Home, Information and Entertainment. Guests then enter the building
where more than 120 games, displays and activities are available.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the attraction is not to predict the future, says
Bruce Gordon, the show's producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have designed this experience to be fun, theatrical and
entertaining _ a lighthearted attraction that allows our guests to
try out all of the latest cool and interesting products and to
answer the question, `What is this going to do for me in my
life?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opening June 19, Knott's Snoopy summer includes an extreme
sports showcase by world-class skateboard, BMX bike and in-line
skate athletes; a stunt musical featuring the Wild West Bandits; a
patriotic on-ice parade through American song and dance starring
the world's only skating beagle; and a multimedia laser show
exploding nightly over Buena Park's usually peaceful Reflection
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The shows are designed to compliment GhostRider, the longest
wooden coaster in the West, said Matt Schliesman, Knott's vice
president of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``From daredevil BMX and skateboard athletes to rough-and-tumble
stunt performers to the most graceful ice dancers, we've got
thrills covered this summer,'' he crowed.
</P>
<P>
   Opening June 5, Magic Mountain's Bugs Bunny World provides 16
rides and attractions like the Canyon Blaster mini-coaster; Daffy's
Adventure Tours with Daffy Duck at the wheel; Foghorn Leghorn's
Barnyard Railway, a real coal-burning choo-choo; and a Merrie
Melodies Carousel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the park's Hurricane Harbor waterpark, which opens
May 15, has 22 slides and attractions such as Black Snake Summit,
with two of the tallest enclosed speed slides in the region; Lizard
Lagoon, a 7,000-square-foot pool for teens and adults; and the
Reptile Ridge high-speed body slide complex.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Harbor began operation in 1995 and has become one of
the park's most popular destinations, especially after additional
slides were installed two years later, said Magic Mountain general
manager Del Holland.
</P>
<P>
   The waterpark, he explained, appeals to ``a younger, more active
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City: open 8 a.m. to 10
p.m. ($39, ages 12 and older; $29, kids 3 to 11); (818) 622-3801.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Mountain, Valencia: hours vary ($36, general; $9.99, kids
under 48 inches tall); (818) 367-5965.
</P>
<P>
   Disneyland, Anaheim: hours vary ($39, ages 12 and above; $29,

MLS NEEDS A BIG SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major League Soccer is off to either a distressing or
encouraging start in its fourth season, depending on one's
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is down in strongholds Los Angeles and New England,
and unimpressive in East Rutherford, N.J., Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and Kansas City, according to statistics. Or, crowds are just
warming up, attendance is about equal to last year, and will exceed
'98 totals, according to MLS commissioner Doug Logan.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the best time to make definitive evaluations, but
professional sporting operations are judged largely on perception,
and the MLS needs to make a stronger impression. Attendance should
improve with warmer weather, the opening of the Columbus Crew
Stadium, the Women's World Cup, and doubleheaders involving
national teams. Television ratings are ``dead even with hockey,''
according to Logan, and have increased by 20 percent. Season-ticket
sales are up more than 42,000, a 9 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   But many questions are being raised about the direction of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making so many mistakes that it makes me very
nervous,'' said Steve Gans, a Newton resident and former
administrator with the Baltimore Blast indoor team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the league dies, and there would be nothing to replace it
for 10 or 15 years, it would not be soccer's fault. I don't want to
have to go places and have people ask me, `Why can't soccer make it
in this country?' The fact is, it can. Since the '80s, soccer has
established itself, but too often it has been run into the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Gans, like many others, is concerned that MLS officials have
seldom learned from mistakes or benefited from the successes of
past leagues, such as the North American Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so desperate to jettison everything from the past
because it is associated with failure,'' Gans said. ``But those who
forget the past are condemned to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certain teams were successful is unbelievable in the
midst of this holistic failure. What did they do right?''
</P>
<P>
   The most successful US pro teams of the pre-MLS days were either
committed to community activities, signed interesting players, or
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about inculcating soccer in the sports culture,''
Gans said. ``The opportunity is there, by stressing community
relations and doing the things that are essential for setting down
roots, getting a critical mass who will support the team when
things go bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing some things right in the MLS, especially the
Revolution. But for every Revolution and (general manager) Brian
O'Donovan, there is a buffoon. The Revolution have had people
coming to their games without ever having a winning season, and in
some sense that's groundbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   For as long the MLS sticks to a low-budget blueprint, though,
its growth will be limited. Big-name foreign players are not even
being courted, and young domestic players are not capturing
imaginations, either because of lack of ability or promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be a league that is flooded with new
foreign players every year,'' Logan said. ``We're out of that
business. Maybe it's a fair criticism that young players like Jay
Heaps (Miami) or Jason Moore (D.C. United) haven't been given that
degree of buildup. But it takes a while for them to find a roster
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed a conundrum. The top young players in MLS are
being taken from the collegiate system, which simply does not
prepare them for the professional level. Most of those who succeed
from the college ranks do so despite that experience, not because
of it. In any case, none of those players have captured the
attention of fans on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   US players should be important to MLS, but they should not be
patronized. I happen to believe there are enough American players
to stock an MLS, but those players are not all in the collegiate
system. In fact, if the league depends too heavily on the
collegians for development of coaches, players, and referees, it
will fail.
</P>
<P>
   The NASL expanded too ambitiously, played on artificial
surfaces, etc. But the league also promoted incessantly and its
administrators constantly searched for players who might capture
the imagination. There was excitement and a feeling of adventure
because of that. Once a league has that spirit, publicity is easily
generated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to grow, basically from within, and have some
patience,'' Logan said. ``The teams are mostly playing better than
last year. We have four pretty good teams, and then everyone else,
and we have to make sure the caliber of all the teams improves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be an instant success. We are a work in
progress. But there are positive signs that we are catching on and
starting to grow.''

HAWAII OF OLD CAN STILL BE FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Waikiki. For many repeat visitors to Hawaii, the name
alone is enough to send them scurrying to the comparative
tranquillity of the outer islands. To them, Waikiki is a loose
confederation of ABC stores selling touristy junk, bordered by an
oppressively crowded beach, clogged with skyscraper hotels that
blot out the sun and obliterate the breezes out of the Manoa
Valley. It is noise and hubbub. Las Vegas by the sea. Waikiki
wasn't always this way, though. In the infancy of tourism in these
islands, it was synonymous with a much gentler pace. It's not
difficult to see why. The setting is ideal: a sun-washed scallop of
beach on Oahu's southern shore, aimed slightly west to capture
sunsets, with the extinct volcanic cone of Diamond Head creating
one of the most picturesque _ and photographed _ backdrops in the
islands. Incredibly, as a millennium winds to a close, vestiges of
this Hawaii of old endure to this day. You have to search for them
a little bit, and be persistent, but this cradle of enchantment
will allow you to turn back the clock. Turn it back as far as you
wish _ to the surfer era of the 1950s and '60s; to the '20s and
'30s, when it was the domain of film stars and barons of industry
who could afford the expense (and time) of the boat passage; even
to the turn of the century itself, when it was favored by such
literary giants as Robert Louis Stevenson and Jack London. You'll
find old Hawaii at such venerable hotels as the Royal Hawaiian and
the Moana Surfrider, or listening to '30s-era slack-key music under
a 115-year-old kiawe tree on the grounds of the Halekulani, or
strolling past a 19th-century missionary house _ built in boxy, New
England architecture, with winter storm shutters! _ in downtown
Honolulu. If your plans take you to Waikiki, even if just for a
night or two, use your imagination. Step back in time. Feel some of
the suffocating constraints of life in the 1990s magically melt
away. An excellent place to start is the Royal Hawaiian, easily the
most recognizable landmark at Waikiki. To make it distinctive, the
California-mission structure was painted pink before its opening in
1927. The color wouldn't clear any planning board in the country
today, but in this setting, it is endearing. The Royal, as it has
come to be known, is usually viewed from the beach. Try something
different. The hotel is mercifully set back off Waikiki's frenetic
main drag, Kalakaua Avenue, tucked behind the brown-concrete
drabness of the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. Approach it from
this direction. You'll walk past trendy shops and skirt a fast-food
stand at which ``Danish-style hot dogs'' are sold by an Asian woman
(now that's modern-day Waikiki). Then, the reward: A small, lattice
archway, covered with vines, leads the way t the seldom-used front
door of the Royal (arriving guests are dropped off at a courtyard
entrance in the center of the hotel). A walkway to the front door
winds around an enormous banyan tree, which is alive with
twittering birds just after dawn, and past towering coconut palms
that are descendants of the forest of palms that covered this area
when Waikiki was a beach retreat of Hawaiian royalty in the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   The rising sun has to fight its way through inland canyons of
steel to reach the Royal, but when it does, the banyan tree and the
coconut palms create a delightful mosaic of shadow on the hotel's
pink face. Hotel officials say many guests actually request rooms
on this side of the building
 &UR; _ &LR;  forsaking even such high-demand views as the ocean and Diamond
Head  &UR; _ &LR;  to savor this garden setting in what feels like a
wild-bird sanctuary. While walking the halls of this hotel, or
having breakfast in its open-air, beachside Surf Room, you half
expect to bump into Carole Lombard or Douglas Fairbanks or one of
the du Ponts - among the frequent guests during the Royal's glory
era. This was Hollywood's playground in the 1930s - even serving as
a film location for ``Waikiki Wedding,'' with Bing Crosby, in 1935.
Two doors down, at the Moana, the time warp is even more
pronounced. In another two years, this hotel will celebrate its
centennial - it became Waikiki's first major hotel when it opened
in 1901, and its ambience has changed very little since.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking sharply from an architectural trend of its day - most
outsiders ignored native design and built as if they were in
Philadelphia in winter - the Moana, though of a Victorian theme,
was constructed to capture breezes from both ocean and mountain
Today, its lobby remains blissfully open-air, and it features an
enormous, sweeping veranda that opens onto a beachside courtyard,
all of this beneath a banyan tree that has flourished since it was
planted in 1885. On any afternoon or evening here, you're likely to
find guests - many of them elderly - basking in a bygone time. They
read newspapers and books, play cards, smoke cigars and engage in a
dying art: simple conversation. Although the nearby bar bustles
with activity, there is no need to worry about the intrusion of
blaring sports highlights on ESPN. In fact, there isn't a TV in
sight. The Moana and the Royal, both operated by the Sheraton
chain, are the rare Waikiki hotels that didn't raze their original
buildings when an extreme demand for hotel rooms developed in the
1960s and '70s. The two hotels stuck with their original structures
- six stories each - and instead added modern tower wings to
accommodate the burgeoning demand.
</P>
<P>
   Subhed: Stepping back in time &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If they're so inclined, nostalgia buffs who visit Hawaii can
really turn their imagination loose. A number of books chronicle
the impressions of visitors from various eras. And the Bishop
Museum, which lies on the northwestern outskirts of Honolulu,
maintains a rich display of treasures from history both distant and
recent. Most of the visitors who arrived here from America and
Europe more than a century ago simply didn't get it. They surveyed
island life that blended perfectly with the climate and gentle pace
of the islands and for some reason set about trying to create a
world that felt like home. This applied to attire, diet,
architecture and entertainment. Lucy G. Thurston, a missionary wife
who arrived from Boston in 1820, wrote in her diary, ``The men wore
girdles, and the women a slight piece of cloth wrapped round them,
from the hips downward. To a civilized eye, their covering seemed
to be revoltingly scanty.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of current fashion trends in Hawaii, it is almost
painful to view photographs from 19th-century life in the islands.
Men of Hawaiian high society are in suits, even on the beach. Local
women are attired in the clothing that, for the sake of modesty,
newcomers urged them to wear: long-sleeved, high-collared,
calf-length gowns. No wonder no one is smiling into the camera. At
the Bishop Museum, you'll also learn that the Congregational
missionaries from New England were mortified by the hula, a
storytelling native dance in which the hands tell a tale while the
hips maintain the rhythm of the song. Hawaii's newcomers, while
instituting their fashion standards and building their
tiny-windowed homes and churches out of blocks of lava rock, sought
to eradicate the dance from Hawaiian culture. Even 100 years later,
assimilation by Hawaii's visitors remained minimal. The March 12,
1901, edition of Honolulu's Pacific Commercial Advertiser heralded
the opening of the Moana on Waikiki. It included the dinner menu
for the event: olives, salted almonds, English sole, mallard duck,
beef a la Portuguese, Roquefort cheese. Not a scrap of guava,
mango, ono or mahi mahi to be found, much less any kind of drink
with coconut in it. As for attire, little had changed in 100 years.
Author W. Somerset Maugham visited Hawaii in 1916 and wrote, ``The
Americans, ignoring the climate, wear black coats and high,
starched collars ... The Kanakas (native men), pale brown, with
crisp hair, have nothing on bt a shirt and a pair of trousers.''
One of the Moana's lobby walls today includes a photograph of two
women decked out in acceptable swimming attire of the time: a
long-sleeved, knee-length wool dress, gathered at the waist, and
heavy stockings to hide their legs. By contrast, today's visitors
dress in the least-constrictive clothing and footwear they can
find, sleep in open-window comfort and eat from the bounty of the
sea and the inland valleys. The Moana's restaurant has long since
ditched the English sole that was served at its opening, offering
instead island chicken, local prawns, plus Hawaiian snapper, mahi
mahi, opah, ahi, moi and Pacific salmon. Some dishes are accented
with Maui onions. And guests seem content to while away hours in
the wicker chairs on the veranda, the white rocking chairs on the
front porch or the iron patio furniture under the banyan tree -
which was planted for beach shade in the age before sunscreen
lotion. (SECOND TAKES FOLLOWS) &QL;

<P>
   BOSTON -- During the 25 years she was a defense lawyer, Nancy
Gertner was known for her radical causes, red clothing, and loudly
voiced opinions, in the media and the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   In five years as a federal judge, the TV sound bites have given
way to written opinions, the preferred way for judges to voice
their views. The leftish sympathies and scarlet garb seem toned
down too, if only to liberal and maroon. Even the Wall Street
Journal writes approvingly that she has ``largely issued mainstream
rulings, peppered with only occasional flashes of liberalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But recent cases indicate that reports of Gertner's
transformation may be greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   She has found in favor of a woman suffering gender
discrimination at the hands of male-dominated financial
institutions, a black man she believes was repeatedly stopped by
police simply because he's black, and a Latino pursued by federal
agents for possessing ``suspicious'' cash.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, she will decide whether she has the authority to reopen
the case of a man serving a life sentence for the 1988 slaying of
12-year-old Darlene Tiffany Moore during one of Boston's most
notorious gang gunfights. If she does, the move would run counter
to the federal trend against reopening criminal cases tried in
state court.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there's been no great public outcry from prosecutors
over any of Gertner's ruling, few of which have been overturned on
appeal. But she is attracting growing attention in public and legal
circles, a result, defense lawyers and prosecutors say, of Gertner
finding her voice as a judge, becoming accustomed to being behind
the bench rather than in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is careful about when she steps out,'' said Ellen Zucker,
a close friend and former law clerk. ``She doesn't swing from the
branches and say `I'm going to do whatever I want.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She is definitely more attuned to the rights of the accused
than some of the federal judges who used to be prosecutors,''
Zucker said. ``That's no surprise. But she puts everyone through
the paces.''
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern, the chief federal prosecutor in
Massachusetts, praised Gertner's courtesy to all who come before
her but faulted her for decisions like the so-called
driving-while-black case, in which she reduced a defendant's
sentence because she believed the man's criminal record was
inflated by traffic violations that he probably would not have
incurred had he been white.
</P>
<P>
   ``She identified a problem in law enforcement, and it's a good
thing she surfaced the issue,'' Stern said. ``But to address it in
that way, she was way off base.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern considered appealing the decision, decided not to, and
won't discuss his reason. But a prosecutor familiar with the case
said even if an appeals court had overturned Gertner on the issue
of alleged racial discrimination, the other reasons she cited for
reducing the sentence would have been upheld, along with the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   This points up a key aspect of Gertner's judicial approach:
using exhaustive legal research to buttress a novel theory, which
in turn is packaged with more traditional, well-established
precedents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the toughest adjustments for Gertner has been living with
the constraints on her freedom to speak out, a change that has not
come easily. In the summer of 1996, two years after becoming a
judge, Gertner summoned reporters to her chambers to complain about
their coverage of the defense's case in a high-profile Charlestown
murder trial _ a move that stunned some of her colleagues on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she has come to accept the differences between
lawyering and judging.
</P>
<P>
   During her first bail hearing as a judge, ``I realized the
enormous difference between arguing for someone's freedom and
freeing them,'' Gertner said in a recent interview in her
courthouse chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be irresponsible as a lawyer. Your only job is to
represent your client,'' she said. ``You keep your eye on that
ball. As a judge, there are so many more balls.''
</P>
<P>
   By design, she has created other outlets for the passionate,
dissident convictions she once would have aired publicly. She
teaches at Yale Law School, speaks regularly at Northeastern
University Law School, writes articles for law journals, and is
working on a memoir, ``Lawyer With A Red Dress On.''
</P>
<P>
   She also sprinkles her decisions with what she calls ``the Oy
footnote.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Gertner's way of noting her disagreement with rules by
which she is bound. It's a way of saying, ``Oy! I am required to
rule X, but boy do I believe Y,'' Gertner said. ``It is important
that the public understand that just because something is
constitutional does not mean it is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Her law journal writings can cause discomfort, among friends as
well as other judges, because they can be sustained, strongly
worded critiques, including, in one case, criticism of a ruling by
the appellate court that oversees her.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-author on that critical article, Northeastern law
professor Deborah A. Ramirez, tried to persuade Gertner to withdraw
from their collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned because she cares a lot about this and her
voice is strong,'' Ramirez said. ``I thought that in the culture of
the community in which she lives in the courthouse, they might not
accept this. She is a relatively new judge, and I thought she might
want to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case went to the core of a fundamental issue for
Gertner: the exclusion of blacks from a jury considering rape
charges against a black man. The prosecution used its challenges to
eliminate most of the blacks from the jury pool, resulting in an
all-white jury. But the appeals court found no discrimination had
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The law review article was stinging, asserting that the decision
was ``out of step with the First Circuit's own cases, those from
other jurisdictions, as well as the scholarly commentary,'' and
could slow the elimination of racial imbalance on juries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I disagree with something (other judges) do, I will say
it,'' said Gertner. ``I will not be silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important for any judge, though, are the cases she decides
herself. And it is there, when Gertner reveals her frustrations,
that she defines herself as a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: a request that from the US Customs Service, which
wanted permission to seize some allegedly pornographic books.
</P>
<P>
   Gertner said she looked at one of the books and ``didn't think
it was obscene. It was pictures of children, art photos. But when I
looked at the statute, it said that pictures of children with erect
penises are obscene. I was heartsick, but the statute was clear. So
I signed the papers and the books were seized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seizing books! Oy!'' Gertner moaned. ``But there was no
alternative. If the law is against it, the law is against it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the perspective Gertner brings to her consideration of
whether to reopen the Tiffany Moore murder case, in which
investigators reportedly have evidence that the man now serving a
life term did not commit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will work hard and look to find what I think is a just
outcome,'' she said. ``But I also understand that when you hit a
wall in case law that is 180 degrees against you,'' the case law
must be obeyed.

Honolulu:  age before sunscreen lotion.

<P>
   &LR; Subhed: The tourist boom
</P>
<P>
   Several factors led to the assault on Waikiki's onetime
serenity. In the 1940s, barbed wire was strung along the beach in
anticipation of a Japanese land invasion, and tourism
understandably bottomed out. The Royal and Moana were pressed into
service to house Navy personnel. After the war, the growth of
America's middle class and an increase in leisure time made Hawaii
accessible to a wider variety of traveler, not just the wealthy.
The islands were the center of U.S. military operations in the
Pacific, and many servicemen longed to return with their families
for a more pleasurable visit. Then came a series of fortuitous
events. Two occurred in 1959: Jet service to the islands was
instituted, cutting the one-way trip frm 12 hours to under five,
and Hawaii gained statehood. A few years later, during the Vietnam
War, the islands were the primary r&AMP;r site for military personnel
and their families, and Hawaii's popularity grew ever more.
Tourists began to stream onto the islands, from 45,000 in 1950 to 2
million in 1970 to 6.7 million last year. Hotel construction
exploded in the '60s and '70s, as high-rises went up with little
apparent regard for aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   During this era, many of the established hotels leveled their
buildings to meet the demand for towering stacks of nondescript
rooms, but not the Moana and the Royal. They still stand ready to
accommodate anyone seeking nostalgic charm. B.J. Whitman, a
spokeswoman for the Royal, said the hotel's tower - which affords
the requisite views of the ocean and Diamond Head - is most popular
with the hotel's Japanese guests, whereas visitors from Europe
overwhelmingly prefer the historic building. American guests are
split about 50-50 on preference, she said. Erica MacGuyer of the
Moana said the majority of its guests prefer the newer banyan tower
for the classic views, but many still seek out rooms in the old
building, which underwent a $50 million restoration in the late
1980s and is on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's
registry of historic American hotels. Much like other buildings of
its era, it has its quirks. Just as the El Tovar doesn't face the
Grand Canyon and the Hotel del Coronado doesn't face the ocean,
some of the Moana's finest ocean views are lost to fire stairwells
in each of its 1918 wings. But the rooms, though small, are quiet
and have no shortage of modern amenities. When the hotel opened at
the turn of the century, its unheardof in-room conveniences
included telephones and private baths. Today, maintaining that
trend, the rooms have 10-foot ceilings, 8-foot-high windows,
digital thermostats and automatic lights that sense when a person
enters the room. Other stylish touches include mirrors with beveled
edges, frosted-glass bathroom fixtures, hardwood accents and heavy
wooden shutters on the windows. For a building pushing 100, it is
in remarkably good shape. One islander encountered on the
impressive staircase said he books a room there every year. He said
that his son's 80-year-old home on Kauai, by contrast, has all but
succumbed to Hawaii's unofficial state critter, the termite.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Subhed: Comforting settings
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate bygone Waikiki, however, you don't have to wander
all the way back to the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   A taste of the surf culture of the '50s and '60s can still be
had at Duke's Canoe Club, the beach bar of the Waikiki Outrigger
Hotel. It is named in honor of Duke Kahanamoku, an Olympic swimming
champion in 1912 and 1920 and one of the pioneers of modern
surfing. (His 150-pound koa-wood surfboard, which he used in the
'20s, is on display at the Bishop Museum.) The terrace at Duke's
presides over a patch of beach between the Moana and the Royal, and
on any afternoon it swarms with beach boys past and present.
</P>
<P>
   No shirt, no shoes, no service? That may be a common edict along
California's beaches, but it would be no dice here. On a recent
visit, beach bums up into their 50s wandered in barechested,
barefooted and their suits dripping wet. Two young women dragging
inflated air mattresses sat down to order drinks and appetizers.
This is an unpretentious place that captures the atmosphere of
unbridled rolic that came to define Waikiki in the post-World War
II years. Hotel management kind of gets out of the way and gives
the surf crowd full rein. ``It's very casual and very welcoming,''
the Outrigger's Nancy Daniels said of the bar. ``I think that's why
a lot of people like to congregate there.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday afternoon, so many people were crammed into
the joint that bouncers were required to regulate the flow. Below
the terrace, a band was playing contemporary Hawaiian rock, and a
patio area had been pressed into service as a dance floor. Flanking
the scene, in odd juxtaposition, the Hawaiian-music combos at the
Moana, the Royal and the nearby Halekulani doggedly held forth with
their ukeleles, acoustic guitars and lilting vocal technique.
Against the Fender bass and miked drums at Duke's, the old music
had no prayer. But the throwback bands played on, and by the next
night they had the relative quiet of the beach to themselves again.
The Halekulani's patio dining and bar area, called the House
Without a Key (the name derives from a 1925 murder mystery written
by guest Earl Derr Biggers), maintains a longstanding tradition of
offering Hawaiian music each afternoon and evening. It's all set
under that 115-year-old kiawe tree. ``It's not the whole
razzle-dazzle Polynesian entertainment,'' said hotel spokeswoman
Joyce Matsumoto. ``You won't see a knife dance. I think people like
sitting there and like enjoying how gracious and gentle Hawaii is.
You're seeing the sun set, listening to the surf coming in. ``I
think people love coming there because they can imagine their
parents sitting out there.'' The Moana, meanwhile, was the location
of the ``Hawaii Calls'' radio program from 195 until it fizzled out
40 years later. (A TV version of the show aired in Los Angeles in
the '60s, and it served as kind of a video postcard to lure island
visitors.) Today at the Moana, Herb Lee Jr. strums a ukelele in a
band that brings smiles to the faces of older guests when it plays
hapahaole music - English-language Hawaiian standards that date to
the '30s. ``We do our best to try to serve that up,'' he said.
``But this also gives us an opportunity to introduce them to new
music written in that style, or in the Hawaiian style,
Hawaiian-language music.'' The newer music grew out of the Hawaiian
renaissance of the '70s, led by slack-key wizard Gabby Pahinui. And
it blends seamlessly with the mainland-influenced music of a
half-century ago. ``The beauty of it, it is all uniquely Hawaiian.
It has the same aloha,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   As the band took a break, he looked out on the contented hotel
guests gathered on the veranda and the banyan court. Lee spoke of
his music, but his words could just as easily have encompassed the
entire ambience of the setting: ``It's what they're looking for
when they come here - that romantic feeling. We're romantics, too.
It's like rediscovering that (bygone) age.''

   Tourists who have the nostalgia bug will find ample
opportunities to indulge it in Waikiki and Honolulu. WHERE TO STAY:
For more than half a century, the Royal Hawaiian and Moana
Surfrider hotels dominated the Waikiki landscape. Each ancient
structure stands just six stories, although both hotels, which are
operated by the Sheraton chain, have newer towers attached. At the
Royal, rack rates for the historic structure range from $305 to
$535 nightly (the latter for an ocean view. A historic ocean suite
goes for $1,500. Information and reservations: (800) 325-3589 or
(808) 923-7311. Web: www.Royal-Hawaiian.com. At the Moana
Surfrider, nightly rates range from $265 to $405 (ocean view) for
the old building. The hotel also offers a Moana Memories package,
which includes breakfast and afternoon tea, among other things.
Information and reservations: (800) 782-9488 or (808) 922-3111.
Web: www.moana-surfrider.com.
</P>
<P>
   IN TUNE: Hawaiian music dating to the early 20th century and to
Hawaiian royalty in the 19th can be heard at several locales, often
augmented with hula dancing. Daily sunset performances are held
outdoors at the Halekulani, Royal Hawaiian and Moana Surfrider
hotels on Waikiki. The Kodak Hula show, which dates to 1937, is
still held Tuesday through Thursday at 10 a.m. at the Waikiki Shell
Auditorium in Kapiolani Park. Admission: $2.50. Information: (808)
627-3379. The Royal Hawaiian Band, established in 1836, performs
regularly at various locations in Honolulu. Information from the
Hawaii Visistors Bureau: (800) 464-2924. Boat Days, celebrations
for incoming ships, have been revived at Aloha Tower by City
Councilwoman Rene Mansho. Information: (808) 547-7001.
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUM CRAWL: The Bishop Museum (1525 Bernice St., Honolulu)
maintains an outstanding collection of items of Hawaiian history.
It is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $14.95 for
adults, $11.95 for seniors (over 65) and youths (ages 4 to 12;
children under 4 are free). Information: (808) 847-3511. Web:
www.bishop.hawaii.org. In downtown Honolulu, a short stroll on
South King Street will take in the Iolani Palace, the Kawaiahao
Church, the Mission Houses Museum and the famous statue of
Kamehameha the Great.
</P>
<P>
   OFF THE SHELF: Recommended reading for a taste of bygone Hawaii:
``Mark Twain's Letters From Hawaii'' (Appleton); ``A Hawaiian
Reader'' (Mutual Publishing); ``A Hawaiian Reader, Vol. II''
(Mutual Publishing). The Twain book is difficult to find, even in
Hawaii bookstores. Most L.A. County libraries can special order it.
The latter two books are compilations of writings about the islands
by famous writers.

DOLE TALKS LIKE A MODERATE AT N.H. SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEMBROKE, N.H. _ In her fitted blue suit and clicking black
heels, Elizabeth Dole walks through the halls of the Pembroke
Academy, attracting squeals and shrieks as well as puzzlement from
the public high school students here.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like Bob Dole's wife or something,'' one student told
another. Another student was slightly more astute: ``She's running
for president.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after Dole took on the gun lobby in the heart of
gun-friendly New Hampshire, she continued to position herself as a
political moderate in the 11-person Republican field. She
reiterated her opposition to assault weapons and armor-piercing
bullets; she continued to insist that talk of a constitutional
amendment to ban abortions ``is a dead end'' for the GOP; and
unlike many Republican politicians and voters, she insisted that
the United States must stick with Kosovo and win the war.
</P>
<P>
   In Roy Annis's history class Monday, the former executive
director of the Red Cross came to talk about education and public
service with his 20 students. In fact, Dole had hoped to listen to
the students, and said so repeatedly. But the session was as
painful as a root canal. Students were reticent about speaking up,
and some were visibly rolling their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Annis tried to help Dole out, asking his students whether any of
them ever felt in danger when they come to school. The answer was
no. So Annis asked what they would do to improve their school.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Tetrault, 17, who had been looking on with disdain,
decided to pipe up. ``I would get a lot more caring teachers who
actually cared about what they're teaching,'' she said. ``We have
some of them in the school, but not all of them care.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Karr-Walter, 17, concurred with that assessment. ``A lot
of them are just here because they need a job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole quickly praised teachers as the true heroes in society, but
she acknowledged that Tetrault and Karr-Walter have a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there are some teachers who are not well prepared
and not qualified to be in the classroom and we've got to change
that, don't we,'' she said. Dole said there needs to be more
rigorous teacher training programs and a more rigorous
certification process in order to provide students with better
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   When Annis told Dole that his students had held a car wash and
raised $1,000 for the refugees from Kosovo, Jodi Cowger, 17, raised
her hand. She asked Dole why the United States would involve itself
in the Balkans, but not in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you thinking of Rwanda?'' Dole asked, as Cowger nodded her
head.
</P>
<P>
   Dole recounted her visit to the Congo to see the Rwandan
refugees when she ran the Red Cross. ``I was literally stepping
over dead bodies,'' she said, noting that the children were
traumatized from watching their parents hacked to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we probably should have intervened,'' Dole said of the
civil war in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Besides gun control and abortion, Dole has also tried to stake
out a position on Kosovo that would help her stand out from the
field. Like Senator John McCain, a Vietnam veteran and another
candidate for president, Dole said, ``We've got to win the war and
win it absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole said the United States has a national interest in
stabilizing the region, as well as a stake in asserting national
values.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly shifting gears, Dole asked the class ``what about
drugs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me how it starts and what you feel can be done to stop
it,'' she said. ``Obviously, a lot of young lives are being
ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   She called drugs ``a cancer on our society,'' and said she wants
to have a drug-free nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, it can absolutely ruin your life,'' Dole said. ``I
feel we need to speak out that drugs aren't cool, they kill, they
ruin your mind. How are we going to stop this? How do you feel
about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's soliloquy, however, was greeted by stony silence and a
few smirks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad, can you get drugs at Pembroke Academy,'' Annis asked,
trying to help out again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' the student said, noting that cigarette smoke in the
school bathrooms is prevalent as well.
</P>
<P>
   As Dole left the class, she stopped to shake hands with each of
the students. Tetrault told a reporter she thought the session was
stupid. ``It's not real, it's not realistic at all,'' she said,
just as Dole stopped to shake her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Cowger, however, was breathless at the experience.
</P>

GOVERNOR SHAHEEN'S SAVVY 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- It's time for the rest of the country to take a
peek at New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the presidential primary nine months away; that stuff
has yet to acquire the relevance even of spring training. The
reason New Hampshire beckons is for the lesson in consensus
politics it can teach right now, all the more important because the
issue involved is education. Moreover, the lesson will tell serious
politics watchers a great deal about the atmosphere in which the
presidential season will ultimately unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Not many weeks ago, local analysts were doing tap dances on
Governor Jeanne Shaheen's head, celebrating the presumed demise of
her efforts to reform the state's method of paying for the public
schools under Supreme Court order.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly from within her Democratic Party, both locally and
nationally, many were also gloating at the presumed political
demise of Shaheen because she failed to see their wisdom in arguing
that New Hampshire's school crisis was the perfect opportunity to
impose an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many saw the same old shouting match between left and
right as a conversation that ordinary citizens were having, which
was presumed to have framed the debate and the choices for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this noise and inaccurate analysis and prediction, one
of the country's best governors quietly, and at critical times,
stubbornly, plugged for a consensus solution to one of the toughest
dilemmas a state can face. And now, give or take a few final
details, she has prevailed in a fashion _ conceptually and
legislatively _ that only enhances her special reputation.
</P>
<P>
   For those who insist on strictly political metaphors, here's
one: The leadership Governor Shaheen has shown and the huge results
her gentle relentlessness has produced constitute exactly what
Texas Governor George Bush was unable to pull off when faced with a
similar challenge. For those local and national geniuses who crowed
that Jeanne Shaheen, after this mess, would never be considered for
national office by Al Gore or Bill Bradley, let's drag out those
two words one last time _ wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   In the almost two years that have passed since the New Hampshire
Supreme Court decided an open-and-shut case and ruled that local
property taxes alone are an unconstitutional method of paying for
public schools because they are unevenly levied among wealthy and
not-so-wealthy communities, both the left and right have screamed
more than they have thought. New Hampshire is a place justly
infamous for its polarizing politics.
</P>
<P>
   The right pushed for amending the New Hampshire Constitution to
undo the ruling, in effect ending the state's responsibility for
educating kids. The left tried to seize the opportunity to impose,
at long last, an income tax, even though Shaheen had pledged not to
allow one.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially alone, Shaheen argued that the inequity found by the
court could be fixed through consensus rather than revolution, and
the state gradually realized that here was a veteran pol who
actually meant what she said and said what she believed.
</P>
<P>
   And what Shaheen believed was that the court requirement that a
fair method of financing the cost of an adequate education could be
devised without a tax revolution.
</P>
<P>
   She was right. The core of an effort to come up with $825
million ($4,220 per pupil) to make the system whole is a statewide
property tax that will actually reduce levies for people and
business in 80 percent of the state's localities, contains some
compensating business taxes, raises cigarette taxes by 25 cents,
and uses a chunk of New Hampshire's share from the settlement of
national tobacco lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   That and a few other items still leaves the Legislature's
package $40-plus million short, and further litigation could mess
the case up again. But the journey Shaheen started is almost ended
_ and on the same, fair terms with which she began it.
</P>
<P>
   The shame for the state is that she had to do it alone, in the
face of hate, ridicule, and condescension. As usual, the people out
of touch were the ideological elites, not ordinary folks and their
tough governor.

HOUSE, SWEET HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under-30 Americans may never have heard of the issue, but a good
many older readers were taught that a house is not a home, and
several have written recently to complain about the house-wreckers
among us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even that most wretched of poets, Edgar Guest, knew the
difference between a house and a home,'' writes Robert Stange of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shouldn't we say `house for sale' instead of `home for
sale'?'' asks Lily Chen of Sudbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   And a plea for help comes from Pat Bailey of Tucson, who teaches
English as a second language. ``I was asked for a general rule
regarding when to use house and when to use home,'' writes Bailey.
``The more I thought about it, the more difficult it became. . . .
How can I explain this simply to my students?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, even in English it's not simple. Homes as a synonym for
houses _ as in ``stately homes of England'' _ is relatively recent.
And in the 20th century, as social barriers became more permeable,
house and home became a usage marker separating the better classes
from the strivers.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Post's Etiquette, published in 1927, devotes an entire
chapter to language. There's a Do Not Say list (say wash, not
perform ablutions), and a Very Bad Taste list (``Drapes . . . an
inexcusable vulgarism''). Worse yet, though, is saying home for
house; even in the 1945 revision, the issue rates its own section.
You may say ``Our home was an old Georgian house,'' but never ``We
had a Georgian home.'' The war continues in Nancy Mitford's 1956
collection of commentaries on class and usage, ``Noblesse Oblige.''
``They've a lovely home'' is labeled non-U, or non-upper-class,
usage; home for house is apparently an unseemly intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   But even for the purists, the line isn't always clear: House and
home are not two entirely different words, like flaunt and flout.
It's precisely the overlap in meaning that puts the humor in ``A
House is Not a Home,'' Polly Adler's title for her book about
brothel life. It's the overlap that makes the sentimental point in
Guest's, ``It takes a heap o' livin' in a house to make a home.''
(Another source quotes it as, ``It takes a heap o' livin' and some
love to make a home,'' which is not an improvement.)
</P>
<P>
   For Pat Bailey's ESL students, perhaps the safest course would
be to choose house when a noun is needed; it will rarely be wrong.
My house is your house is less welcoming than my home is your home,
but no less correct. The home has a leaky roof, on the other hand,
is clearly not idiomatic.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate ads aside, the rest of us can relax. Few people
nowadays go around saying our home in an effort to sound superior.
As language fights go, house vs. home was a minor domestic dispute;
it's time to move on.

COURT TAKES UP RULING THAT SUPPORTED AMIRAULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When bizarre, horrific stories emerged in 1984 about
toddlers being sexually abused at the Fells Acres Day Care Center
in Malden _ molested with butcher knives, tied naked to trees _ the
arrest and prosecution of the center's elderly owner and her two
adult children came to symbolize a criminal justice system righting
a terrible, tragic wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 15 years later, as the latest in a string of legal appeals
makes its way to the state's highest court this week, the
prosecution of the now-dead Violet Amirault and her children,
Cheryl Amirault LeFave and Gerald, has, for many, come to symbolize
something quite different: a criminal justice system gone horribly
wrong in its zeal to protect and punish.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, as popular opinion and courtroom
verdicts have tilted away from the once-unchallenged belief that
children always tell the truth _ even when coaxed by investigators,
even when what they're saying is truly fantastic -- the Fells Acres
case has become a rallying point for those who think investigators
pushed too hard and accepted too much that was told them by small
children.
</P>
<P>
   What brings the case before the state Supreme Judicial Court, in
fact, is a judge's finding last June that the alleged child victims
were manipulated by ``overzealous'' investigators who succumbed to
``a climate of panic, if not hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   In throwing out the child abuse conviction of LeFave, Superior
Court Judge Isaac Borenstein also barred the alleged victims from
testifying in the future, in effect blocking a retrial of the case.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave and her mother had actually been granted a new trial in
1995 by a different judge, who ruled that the special courtroom
seating arrangement for the child witnesses violated their
constitutional right to confront their accusers. But a new trial
was never held. Her mother, who was released from prison pending a
new trial, died of cancer in September 1997. Gerald Amirault, who
was tried separately, remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein's ruling came in a stinging, 140-page decision which
faulted interviewers _ including a nurse and police officers _ for
using overly-suggestive techniques and refusing to take ``no'' for
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Borenstein wrote, investigators were out to get
the Amiraults, ignoring the children's ``incredible'' claims of
talking robots, the torture of animals in public and children being
tied naked to a tree in front of the school.
</P>
<P>
   As time has passed, cases like Fells Acres have spawned a
massive national dialogue on the handling of similar allegations of
widescale child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the good things that has come out of cases like Fells
Acres is a better practice of looking at how interviews are
conducted of children, especially younger kids,'' said Brian
Holmgren, senior attorney for the National Center for the
Prosecution of Child Abuse in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, those cases also generate the kind of publicity
and public response that tend to influence a lot of prosecutions
and create judicial precedent,'' he said, ``and that is not
necessarily for the good.''
</P>
<P>
   With time, scrutiny of Fells Acres and other cases like it gave
way to techniques that are less leading and less aggressive. Just a
month ago, the Middlesex District Attorney's office, which
prosecuted the Amiraults, unveiled its new, less-suggestive
techniques for interviewing alleged child abuse victims.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some children's advocates and law enforcement officials
worry the pendulum is now swinging in the opposite direction. The
flood of criticism aimed at the Fells Acres investigation, they
fear, has had a damaging effect on the public's will to investigate
and prosecute sex crimes against children.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that continuing research on children's
``suggestibility,'' or vulnerability to outside influence, may
cause children's claims of abuse to be viewed with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, we see an undermining of the child
witness...and a general perception of victims of child abuse that
is completely changing,'' said Eileen King, executive director of
One Voice, an alliance of survivors of sexual abuse, attorneys and
mental health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children and parents are being told to come forward and tell,
but when they do they are either not believed, or the case gets
stymied or never prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, King said, ``It becomes more and more difficult for
children to come forward, be believed, receive proper
representation, and have prosecutors confident of being able to
take these cases forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you create a body of research that says children cannot
be reliable witnesses, you not only have an effect on the Amirault
case, for bettter or worse,'' King said, ``but that research is
then used by defense attorneys all over the country to create legal
arguments against child abuse witnesses everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a result of retooling investigative techniques used in
child sex abuse cases, prosecutors have ``come up with guidelines
to how we should question children in these kinds of events,'' said
attorney James L. Sultan, who represents LeFave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand now that it has to be done very carefully,
without leading questions, without threats, without promises, and
without pressure,'' Sultan said. ``And it has to be done in a very
careful, deliberate way if there's any chance of actually getting
to the truth.''

RICH IN HIS OWN BACKYARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes it takes a move or a remodeling job to discover your
own backyard. Although I'm a native Bostonian, it took my native
New York wife to lead me to discover there is indeed life beyond
Interstate 495.
</P>
<P>
   For five years we explored and lived in Franklin County, some 80
miles west of Boston, discovering the scenic beauty, especially
during foliage season; taking boat rides along the Connecticut
River from the Northfield Mountain Recreation Center; wandering
along Historic Deerfield's mile-long street (said to be one of the
most beautiful in America) lined with 18th- and 19th- century
homes; then heading down routes 5 and 10 to Yankee Candle (a sight
to behold, it's said to be the world's largest candle shop and one
of the state's top attractions); shopping in Greenfield with its
classic and lively downtown; driving west on Route 2 past rocks
with dinosaur tracks imbedded in them to Shelburne Falls for the
beautiful Bridge of Flowers and million-year-old glacial potholes;
then continuing along the Mohawk Trail (America's first scenic auto
route) to Williamstown to visit the magnificent Sterling and
Francine Clark Art Institute (413-458-9545) filled with more than
30 works of Renoir, Impressionists, Old Masters, and paintings by
Homer, Sargent, Cassatt, and Remington.
</P>
<P>
   We'd cap off the trip with a stay at The Orchards in
Williamstown (413-458-9611), an inn that is both stately and
welcoming. The rooms are large and accommodatingly comfortable.
Many rooms overlook a delightful garden courtyard. English antiques
are everywhere. The service and dining is superb. Many on the staff
are from Scotland and Germany, and innkeeper Sayed Saleh, an
impeccable Egyptian, has just added an unbelievable wine cellar.
</P>
<P>
   The inn scene in Massachusetts is one of the commonwealth's
delights we've come to appreciate only recently. With our getaway
Cape home being remodeled, we've been forced to find other places
to stay to avoid the mess at our place. This has led us to discover
some of Cape Cod's best inns, all of which we highly recommend..
</P>
<P>
   The Whalewalk Inn in Eastham (508-255-0617) has 12 wonderful
rooms, some with fireplaces. Innkeepers Carolyn and Dick Smith are
friendly and welcoming. The outdoor brick garden patio is a nice
setting for breakfast in summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Captain's House Inn in Chatham (800-315-0782) is a stately
Greek Revial house set behind an equally stately hedgerow. The main
house is filed with antiques and four-poster beds. We stayed in the
carriage house in a room with both a Jacuzzi and fireplace.
Innkeepers are Jan and Dave McMaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Wedgewood Inn in Yarmouthport (508-362-5157), along scenic
Route 6A, is the quintessential New England inn. Built in 1812, it
is a Greek Revival home with Federal accents. We dined in the main
house, but stayed in the carriage house where the old and the new
blend beautifully. Innkeepers are Gerrie and Milt Graham.
</P>
<P>
   The Dan'l Webster Inn in the heart of Sandwich, the Cape's
oldest town, is a full-service inn with many awards for its dining,
accommodations (Mobil four-star), and wines. The 47-room inn is
adding eight super deluxe rooms with fireplaces, oversized
whirlpool baths, two-person showers, and ``Romeo and Juliet''
balconies. These rooms will be available in late June. In season
there is an outdoor pool and gardens. The inn is just minutes from
Heritage Plantation, a wonderful museum filled with Americana (even
a classic carousel), antique cars, and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage Plantation opens next Sunday, Mother's Day, and all
mothers will be admitted free.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to discover your backyard is by reading the

SALUTING THE GREATEST GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a different time it was. Overseas, it was a time of war. At
home, it was a time of sacrifice _ making do with broken-down cars,
using ration stamps, growing victory gardens, and displaying blue
or gold stars in the window. But it was also a time when Americans
sang the ``Beer Barrel Polka'' along with ``God Bless America,''
bought War Bonds, admired Bogart and Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' and
danced the jitterbug.
</P>
<P>
   The American Home Front, with all its joy and sadness, is the
theme of our Museum of the Month, the Wright Museum in Wolfeboro,
N.H. Exhibits re-create the nation during the World War II years of
1939 through 1945, with memorabilia, vehicles, films, artifacts,
and stories about the men and women whom newsman Tom Brokaw has
justifiably called the Greatest Generation.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are first introduced to the Home Front through an
eight-minute movie that highlights the unique events of each year
(in 1943, for instance, girls were swooning over a skinny singer
named Sinatra). Then it's on to the displays _ gas pumps, autos,
red cents for rationed goods, a soda fountain, a living room
dominated by a console radio that brought the war news, models of
soldiers and war brides, and the faces and voices of local people
who lived through those years, telling their stories on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   A second building is replete with the paraphernalia of war _
jeeps, tanks, command cars, half-tracks, and motorcycles. Exhibits
and videos highlight such topics as the role of women fliers, the
sinking of American ships and submarines, and a salute to a local
hero, Rene Gagnon, who helped raise the flag at Iwo Jima.
</P>
<P>
   Those who participated in the struggles and triumphs of Home
Front America should find the Wright Museum fascinating. But so
should those who never knew.
</P>
<P>
   (The Wright Museum is at 77 Center St., Wolfeboro, NH 03894;
phone 603-569-1212 or visit www.wrightmuseum.org. There is a
nominal charge. The museum is on a six-acre site, and a 200-yard
footpath connects it with the town's delightful shopping-and-dining
area and marina.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; And speaking of those days: Meanwhile, in Middlesex, Vt., there's
the Camp Meade Victory Museum. For a nominal fee visitors are
transported to the 1930s and '40s at this former Civilian
Conservation Corps camp. (The CCC was one of President Franklin
Roosevelt's New Deal programs in the '30s, giving unemployed young
people an opportunity to do useful conservation and reforestation
work in exchange for room, board, and a small stipend.) As guests
learn about the camp's history, the sounds of Harry James's trumpet
and the Glenn Miller band fill the air. More than 25 indoor and
outdoor exhibits present artifacts, photos, videos, recordings, and
lifelike displays. You can dine at the USO Canteen, and for $42
even stay overnight in a comfy cabin. The camp is open from mid-May
through mid-October. For more information, call 802-223-5537.

   Travel trivia: What creature is found on the Maine state seal?

<P>
   Quotable: ``It was not price or money that could have purchased
Rhode Island. Rhode Island was purchased by love.'' _ Roger

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In a name: The name of the Maine community of Ogunquit comes
from an Algonquin Indian name meaning ``Beautiful Place by the
Sea.'' And so it is.

   Claim to fame: The first European potato in the United States

   Maybe we should call it New Ireland: There are more people of
Irish descent (4 million) in New England than in Ireland (about 3.5
million).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drip, drip: A posting in hotel rooms at the
environmentally-conscious Boston Park Plaza explains why guests
should be sure faucets are completely shut: ``It takes more than 2
million gallons of clean water to bathe and feed one adult for a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of cats and castles: It's a good thing stage actor William
Gillette built a castle in Connecticut: You need a lot of room when
you keep up to 17 cats at once. Gillette's castle in East Haddam is
one of about a dozen described in Yankee magazine's annual Travel
Guide to New England. Also featured: 30 perfect vacation days, 75
unique New England souvenirs, and 500 new picks for food, lodging,
shops, and places you shouldn't miss. The magazine, available at
newsstands and supermarkets, costs $4.99.

RADIO DAYS LIVE ON AT THIS UNIQUE INN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBOROUGH, N.H. _ Suddenly it was 1948. The voice on the old
G.E. radio belonged to a genius named Orson Welles, who was telling
a tale well calculated to keep you in suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was 1853, and President Franklin Pierce was holding
court at his boyhood home, enthralling guests with the story of his
triumphs and tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was time immemorial, with the wind dancing through
the trees, water splashing over rocks, cows lowing, birds
twittering, and squirrels chattering.
</P>
<P>
   Such time travel is effortless when you visit peaceful
Hillsborough and stay at one of the nation's most unusual
bed-and-breakfasts, the Inn at Maplewood Farm.
</P>
<P>
   The B &AMP; B is unusual not because of its considerable charm, but
because it's also a radio station, broadcasting dramas, comedies,
and (shudder) tales of terror from the Golden Age of Radio in the
parlor and four guest suites _ and nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Although just 31, the proprietor, Jayme Simoes, has been a fan
of old radio since he first heard a rebroadcast in Chicago when he
was 13. ``It was so unusual to hear people talking to each other on
the radio then,'' he says. He began to tune in every week, became
hooked, and is now the owner of some 50 vacuum-tube radios, mostly
from the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when he and his wife, Laura, bought the 1794 home, then
converted it into a bed-and-breakfast that opened in May 1993, he
came to the right place. Hillsborough, it turns out, is the home of
Piexx, a treasure trove of old radios and other electronic
nostalgia. The proprietor, Christopher Sieg, set up the a
100-milliwatt broadcasting station at the inn, and now all that
guests need do is tune to 100 AM on the 1940s radios in the four
guest rooms or the one in the parlor to hear an evening's
entertainment featuring ``The Lone Ranger,'' ``The Green Hornet,''
``Captain Midnight,'' ``Suspense,'' ``Fibber McGee and Molly,'' or
so many other splendid shows that are part of Simoes's collection
of more than 1,000 broadcasts. And this is accomplished in a way
that would amaze even radio's Chandu the Magician: with a
transmitter smaller than a pack of cigarettes, linked to a carousel
of five compact discs containing the evening's shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We imagine the America that listened to the radio each night
as a very different place,'' says Jayme Simoes. I can attest to
that because I grew up during radio's final glory years. I remember
waiting eagerly to hear Chester A. Riley proclaim, ``What a
revoltin' development this is!'' and Jack Benny's friend Mr. Kitzel
outline the formula for a perfect hamburger: ``Wid de peekle in de
middle and de mustard on top!'' I remember my father faithfully
tuning in to Bing Crosby's show to hear him sing about the blue of
the night meeting the gold of the day. And I remember my brother
and me daring each other to listen to ``Lights Out'' _ with the
lights out. With programs like these, and the need to visualize,
radio exercised the mind. And then television came along and did
the opposite. What are today's TV viewers going to remember decades
from now: Ally McBeal falling into a co-ed toilet bowl? But I
digress.
</P>
<P>
   It was a soft, sunny afternoon when my wife, Linda, and I
arrived at the 14-acre Maplewood Farm and were shown to our room.
She was enchanted by many things: the knotty-pine walls, the
antiques, the quilt on the bed, the gas-powered fireplace, the
grandfather clock that gave the right time twice a day (a joke
older than radio). I liked them, too, once I was able to take my
eyes off the room's radio: a 1948 General Electric Model 115,
complete with glowing tubes that take a minute or so to heat up and
an authentic low hum. Simoes, who is happy to accommodate radio
requests, agreed to start the programming early that day, and I
could have listened all afternoon to the programs, which included
``Suspense'' (featuring Orson Welles in the chilling ``Donovan's
Brain''), ``Dimension X,'' ``Richard Diamond,'' and others. But my
wife couldn't. ``It's a beautiful day,'' she said, so I turned off
the radio and we we went out to see Hillsborough.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to view in this town of 4,000 people, beginning
with the dozen ``field-tenders'' right outside the inn _ Holstein
cows who appear courtesy of Eccardt Farm, just 15 minutes up the
road and one of the last family-run dairy farms in southern New
Hampshire. The clanking of cowbells seemed a joyful kind of music.
</P>
<P>
   Where to go: the small but bustling downtown with its several
antique shops, dining spots, and that old-radio store? The
neighboring Fox State Forest with its lake, mountain views, and 20
miles of hiking trails? The Franklin Pierce Home, boyhood home of
America's ``forgotten'' 14th president? Eventually, we would hop
into the car and visit them all, but first it was time for a
half-mile walk (some of it uphill) to Hillsborough Center, which
appears much as it did in the 1780s. The sights include a pewter
shop, an 1818 schoolhouse, and a lost-animal pound _ fortunately
the rock-enclosed structure is no longer operating or my wife would
have no doubt brought home a lost animal. More sights: the town
common, period homes, gravestones from the early 1800s with their
lugubrious verses, and two white clapboard churches _ the kind so
closely associated with New England. All afternoons should be so
peaceful and pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was into the car to enjoy the downtown (and to note that
Hillsborough even has a nostalgic diner, Caron's) and to relish the
outdoors as we rode over double-arch stone bridges and got out to
look at brooks that really do babble. Ordinarily, we would have
also visited the Pierce homestead that afternoon, but, as
serendipity would have it, we instead went to a special event there
in the evening: the annual gala honoring President and Mrs. Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night of cocktails, canapes, entertainment, and, of
course, history. A talented twosome named Harold Fernald and
Priscilla Triggs Weeks impersonated the president and his wife,
Jane Means Appleton Pierce. They talked about Pierce's rapid rise,
becoming a US congressman and senator, a brigadier general in the
Mexican War, and, in 1852 at age 48, the youngest elected president
at that time. But tragedy followed the Pierces down the paths of
glory: Two of their children died very young and the Pierces
witnessed the death of their only surviving child in a terrible
train accident. As she told the story, Mrs. Pierce wept.
</P>
<P>
   But this was primarily a happy occasion, filled with dancing,
folk-singing, a classical concert, and tours of the 1804 home with
its big rooms, hand-stenciled walls, imported wallpaper, and myriad
artifacts. One highlight was a demonstration of the grand
hammer-dulcimer and virginall by a true renaissance man named R. P.
Hale. We were in good spirits as we drove back to the inn in time
to catch the final old-radio programs of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Morning brought breakfast in the bright kitchen, where Laura
Simoes's teapot collection is on display. (If we chose to, we could
have had breakfast delivered to our room in a basket or dined
outside in the orchard.) Until last year, Laura joined in preparing
breakfast, but now she has a new job as director of publicity for
New Hampshire tourism. So it's up to Jayme now, and that morning he
did a fine job with a little help from German John's bakery in
downtown Hillsborough. Breakfast consisted of coffee, juice,
Stonyfield Farm yogurt, melon, and a selection of German John's
treats such as kuchen-streudel and fruit-filled rolls. Those bakery
products were so good, in fact, that before we left Hillsborough,
we stopped in at German John's to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   I left town thinking about the introduction to ``The Lone
Ranger'' radio show, which referred to ``those thrilling days of
yesteryear.'' After our stay in Hillsborough, I would change that
to ``those delightful days of yesteryear.''

WHAT IT'S LIKE TO STAY IN A YURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE DANIEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKWOOD, Maine _ After a day of cross-country skiing, I arrived
back just in time to watch a soft sunset turn the sky pink from
atop the hill our yurt was perched on. Only woods and snow were in
sight, and our off-white canvas-covered home for the night blended
in to the scenery. If you're used to sleeping indoors and eating
out, then staying in a yurt at the Birches on Moosehead Lake might
seem like roughing it, but if you're a camper, like I am, bedding
down in one of their three yurts is a five-star experience.
</P>
<P>
   Yurts, circular tents more than tall enough to stand in, were
first used by Mongolian nomads. They are becoming popular in
back-country ski areas, both as warming huts and places to stay,
and are used in the summer by hikers and mountain bikers. The wall
framework is composed of lattice-work, similar looking to that used
for baby gates. Atop this framework are a number of roof rafters
that come together at the peak of the roof, eliminating the need
for a center pole.
</P>
<P>
   The yurts at the Birches come equipped with two bunk beds topped
with foam mattresses, a cooking stove, water, a Coleman lantern,
and kitchen equipment, and they all have outhouses a few yards
away. For winter use, the highlight is the wood-burning stove _
complete with a supply of wood and an ax. Talk about luxury. Summer
features are a skylight for star gazing and windows all around. Our
yurt was furnished with a picnic table, two chairs, and even a
couch, giving it a kind of frat-house effect. The best part of all:
Birches staff will deliver you and your gear, either by snowmobile
in the winter or by all-terrain vehicle, to the yurt.
</P>
<P>
   In February my camping buddy, Bill, and I stayed in the Overlook
yurt, about a mile and a half from the lodge of the Birches, a
wilderness resort area on Moosehead Lake and across from Mount
Kineo, about a five-hour drive from Boston. A sporting camp built
in the 1930s, the Birches has a full-service restaurant and rustic,
charming housekeeping cabins just a few feet from the water. But if
you stay in those you have next-door neighbors, whereas the yurts
are surrounded only by woods. The Three Sisters yurt is about 2
miles from the lodge, and the most recent addition, the Poplar Hill
yurt, is 7 miles away and overlooks Brassua Lake. I liked being
able to walk to the lodge in less than 30 minutes, but my next stay
will be at Poplar Hill, because I like the idea of solitude even
more.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think (and hope) that the 11,000-acre wilderness preserve
the Birches sits on would mean peace and quiet, but that's not
always the case. As Bill observed, it's a place where two worlds
collide, where the tree-huggers (that's us) and the machine-lovers
share turf. Opening up its land to both factions is the only way
the Willard family can stay in business (the Birches rents both
nordic ski equipment and snowmobiles), and for the most part, it
works. But be warned that in the winter there is an oft-heard buzz
of snowmobiles out on the many trails throughout the woods. And in
the summer, Jet-Skis cruise the 3,000 feet of shoreline on Maine's
largest lake.
</P>
<P>
   The nordic ski area has 24 miles of mostly groomed trails _
which snowmobiles are not allowed on, a rule that Birches president
John Willard enforces. (If you're interested in downhill,
Greenville's Big Squaw Mountain is nearby.) Most trails are rated
intermediate and novice. Many go over abandoned woods while others
wind through beautiful woods of tall spruce and hemlock, such as
the Baker Trail loop, one of the prettiest places to ski I've seen.
Conditions were icy when we visited, and for this novice skier it
was tough going, but unlike touring centers near Boston, the trails
were nearly empty, allowing me time to go as slowly as I needed to
go. Bill, on the other hand, a pro at back-country skiing, went on
almost all the trails, stopping for lunch and a rest at the scenic
Poplar Hill yurt. He decided that that remote yurt would make the
perfect weekend vacation spot for his wife and three children. Not
only do the yurts come stocked with a roll-away bed along with the
bunks and couch, you can pitch a tent nearby if you need more
space.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, we got the stove going until we were as toasty as
we could stand being, then heated up chili I'd brought from home.
We later went down to Moosehead Lake in the light of the moon, me
on foot and Bill on skis. We walked out on the frozen lake, dotted
with a few ice-fishing shacks. The snowmobilers had turned in for
the evening, and we could hear heaving ice and the water moving
underneath the lake, making whale-like sounds. It was eerie and
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight the temperature dipped to the single digits. The
inside of the yurt was only barely warmer when we awoke, as we had
let the fire die. We had winter sleeping bags, and knew we'd be
fine, but it was not easy getting out of them. Once the stove got
going again (thank you, Bill), we were happy.
</P>
<P>
   After warming up with a big bowl of oatmeal, I went to the lodge
to meet ski instructor Karen Francoeur, who promised to help me
feel more comfortable on cross-country skis. She's a patient,
knowledgeable teacher for all levels, even remedial types like me,
and my skiing indeed improved.
</P>
<P>
   Just before sunset, Billy and I showed up at for a prearranged
dog-sled trip with musher Ed Mathieu, who also guides moose safaris
and ice fishing trips. The dogs were fired up, and it was fun
(although chilly) sitting in the toboggan as we jostled and bumped
along ski trails.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, the Birches maintains a nice lakefront beach just
behind the lodge, along with kayak and motorboat rentals. There
also are daily pontoon boat moose cruises and guided kayak trips,
where usually at least one moose is sighted on the shoreline or
wading across shallow parts of the lake, munching on vegetation. In
warm-weather months, the ski trails are used for hiking and
mountain biking (rentals are available). I'm looking forward to
cycling out to my summer yurt, but I think I'll still let the
Birches carry my gear; after all, it is a vacation.

THE MARKET GOES TO WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My dear friend _ and modern stock market fanatic _ Joe King,
always has a provocative word or two. So, when he offered, I jumped
at the chance to publish his personal diary covering the first
month of the war in the Balkans. I've taken it upon myself to edit
Joe a little, in order to tone down his intemperate glee and coarse
gloating. &QL; 
 &QL; 
March 25. Forget bull or bear _ I'm a hawk. After so much
dilly-dallying, we're finally on our way to war. On TV, I see
missiles demolishing their targets _ kapow! I hear that Milosevic
is herding up people for no other reason than the quirk of their
birth, kicking them out of their country, or worse, slaughtering
them. And I can only drum my fingers on my desk, thinking _
tallying up my winnings. Dow up 169 points. Not bad for the first
day of battle. But still quite a few bullets shy of 10,000. God, I
love this war. I love this market. May they march in lock step to
the next millenium.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   March 26. NATO declares: they're in it for the long haul.
Yeehaw! Optimism everywhere in the market. The news now filled with
reports of executions by the Serbs, burning of villages, refugees
streaming to the borders. I see the dazed children torn from their
parents, all alone now, and maybe forever _ who knows if mom and
dad are face down in a muddy mass grave in their own yard? In the
fumes of death and destruction I smell 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   March 29. A new week. New atrocities. And a glorious new world
on Wall Street. Bodies of ethnic Albanians litter the streets of
Kosovo. WalMart jumps 3 1/4. United States accuses Milosevic of
crimes against humanity. Dow spurts ahead 184 points, and finally _
the big one for the record books _ finishes above 10,000!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   March 30. Horrors! Oh horrors! Milosevic offers to withdraw some
of his forces from Kosovo if the bombing stops _ what is the man
thinking?! Compromise, reconciliation, peace _ none of it is good
for this market. Dow sinks 66 points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   April 1. A big sigh of relief. We're back on track. Three
captured US soldiers shown on Serb TV, looking battered and angry.
Refugees pouring into Albania. The infirm carted for days in
wheelbarrows. A swaddled baby reaches the camps, born the night
before at the side of the road somewhere. Dow dusts itself off,
flexes those toned muscles. Up 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   April 5. The worse things get, the fatter my portfolio grows. US
orders up Apache attack helicopters. Horror stories of the refugees
are mindboggling. Reinforcements called in to help with the flood
of fleeing Kosovars. Troops on TV look like so many teenage boys in
military helmets and green fatigues. All I see is the green, green,
green. Dow rockets up 174 points. There seems no end to the misery
in Kosovo and the merriment on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   April 12 to April 16. Another dismal week for the war.
Completely delightful. NATO bombs a refugee convoy. The United
States sending summons out to 30,000 military reservists. Clinton
warns the war could spread across the Balkans, across all of
southeast Europe. Pentagon says air war may drag into the summer.
Hot dog! The Dow climbs every day of the week, deeper and deeper
into record territory. Now 10,000 is just a quaint memory _ 11,0000
just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   April 22. NATO celebrates its 50th anniversary _ huge summit in
Washington. NATO missiles find Milosevic's villa, and leave it a
smoking, burned-out shell. What a lovely little war we've had this
month. Since the bombs first fell, the Dow is up 1,055 points, or
11 percent. All this in one tiny hot spot. Man alive! Imagine the
market sizzle we'd get from a nuclear holocaust.

ONE MORE REASON TO BE JEALOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We admit it right upfront: We're jealous.
</P>
<P>
   How else should we react to the news that a 29-year-old
entrepreneur has just sold his seven-month-old company for $200
million?
</P>
<P>
   Last week Stig Leschly joined the ranks of multimillionaires
when he sold his Cambridge, Mass. start-up to Amazon.com. Leschly's
company, Exchange.com, electronically links up buyers and sellers
of out-of-print books and records. The company has 31 employees.
</P>
<P>
   If Leschly's story were one of a kind, we might be inclined to
shrug it off. Maria Grasso, the Chilean au pair, won a $197 million
lottery prize last month. Freak things do happen. But in the
super-charged world of technology, the amazing is becoming
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last few months, a series of young and small
Massachusetts companies have been sold for hundreds of millions of
dollars each. It goes without saying that most of the companies
weren't making a profit. But in many cases they didn't have any
sales either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to buy companies on earnings,'' says Howard Anderson,
head of the Yankee Group, a local consulting firm. ``Now we buy on
growth potential.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly was the case with Omnia Communications. The
Marlborough, Mass. company was sold in March for $429 million to
Ciena Corp. of Maryland. Omnia's product, a technology that allows
voice and Internet transmissions to travel over fiber-optic lines,
is in the final stages of development. The company is two years old
and has 75 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone Communications of Westford, Mass. was a similar story.
Redstone is getting ready to ship a high-speed switch for
aggregrating Internet traffic. The firm is just 18 months old. In
March Redstone was purchased for $500 million by Siemens, the
German telecom company. The deal reportedly made millionaires of
more than a dozen Redstone employees.
</P>
<P>
   The new wave of deal-making seems to have thrown out all of the
rules traditionally associated with company building. Once upon a
time, a young entrepreneur started a business with the expectation
it would grow into the next IBM or Microsoft. Today that same
entrepreneur is happy to sell out before the company gets its name
listed in the telephone book.
</P>
<P>
   If the current trend continues, big companies may soon be
shelling out hundreds of millions of dollars for clever ideas
sketched out on the back of cocktail napkins.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   According to experts, a blend of technology, heightened
competition, and soaring stock prices has changed the way business
is done. The tremendous growth in Internet use has fueled the
demand for companies that can sell something over the Internet and
for companies that can boost the speed and carrying capacity of the
network itself, the highway portion of the information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   The highway business has attracted a slew of players, everyone
from Lucent Technologies and Siemens on the telecom side to Cisco
Systems and 3Com Corp. on the computer networking side. All of
these companies are locked in a fierce global struggle for market
share and each is looking to get the technological edge on its
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want to be sure they are not left behind,'' says Paul
Ferri of Matrix Partners, a Waltham, Mass. venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny Massachusetts companies make products that could
deliver that technological edge. They make switches, software, or
chips that the giants want. And thanks to the incredible runup in
stock prices, the giants have plenty to spend. Half a billion
dollars in the form of stock may sound like real money to you, but
for a Cisco or a Lucent, whose market values exceed $150 billion,
those sums don't amount to much. The purchases have been paid for
with a combination of stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The giants are buying early-stage companies because in the
Internet era, getting there first is critical. As Fidelity
Investments says in its latest ad campaign for electronic
brokerage, ``On-line trading is like the Old West. The slow die
first.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fast can make a pile of money. Exchange.com founder
Leschly said he knew he had to move quickly to establish a foothold
in his little corner of the electronic commerce department store.
He has already signed up 3,000 music and book dealers who list
their inventory on his Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   At 29, barely a year out of Harvard Business School, Leschly
already has made a fortune. Still, his life isn't perfect. He told
the Globe that he and his employees have to relocate to Seattle,
where Amazon.com is based. He also suggested his girlfriend wasn't
too thrilled with the prospect of the move.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the story? That even the young and megarich have
problems. That doesn't make us feel a lot less jealous. But it's a
start.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston was honored last week for its charitable work by the
National Society of Fund Raising Executives.
</P>
<P>
   The bank responded appropriately: It is giving away more money.
BankBoston will give $2,500 to each qualified nonprofit
organization that is able to raise at least $5,000 of new corporate
support between now and May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in finding out how the program works should
call 617-426-6400.

THORNTON MAKING A POWERFUL STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- At ice level, the action took place slowly,
methodically. It was an exercise in patience on the power play. The
Bruins' point men, Raymond Bourque and Darren Van Impe, passed the
puck along the blue line. They waited for an open lane, an
opportunity to slide the black disk down low.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 25 seconds into the first-period man-advantage, the action
gathered speed. Bourque and Van Impe traded places. The veteran
captain fed the puck to Jason Allison. The Bruin forward circled
behind the net. He threaded the puck to Dmitri Khristich. The right
wing spied Joe Thornton in his peripheral vision, just beyond the
left post.
</P>
<P>
   For Thornton, the action slowed during one decisive
split-second. The center calmly picked Khristich's pass out of his
skates and turned toward the open net. He threw the puck toward the
goal and past Carolina goalie Arturs Irbe. The last of five Bruins
to touch the puck on the power play, Thornton raised his hands in
celebration after scoring the first goal in Game 6 of this Eastern
Conference quarterfinal _ a goal that stood up as decisive in
Boston's 2-0 series-clinching win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dmitri could see me in the corner of his eye,'' said Thornton.
``I had an open net so it was an easy goal for me. I had a lot of
time, so it was nice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thornton's young, fast-track world, time has always been
relative.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from No. 1 draft pick to NHL force seemed neither
quick nor easy. The progression from mature second-line forward to
major playoff contributor seemed to happen in a matter of weeks.
But Thornton's performance in this series _ making hard plays look
easy _ was the result of two years of NHL experience.
</P>
<P>
   A first-round series win was the logical next step in the
education of the younger Bruins, with Thornton youngest among them.
They needed to know what it felt like to advance in the playoffs.
They needed the confidence that comes with shaking hands at the end
of a series and telling a defeated opponent, ``Have a nice
summer.'' They needed to meet a raised level of expectations and
succeed at a more intense level of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a way to get the job done, and a lot of guys played
big roles on this club and all these guys were young guys,'' said
the 38-year-old Bourque, who is 19 years Thornton's senior. ``It's
real important for us to move on and get that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton and Anson Carter, 24, ``stepped up their game,''
Bourque added, ``and their future is really unlimited as far as how
good they could be in a lot of ways. They're going to be key guys
for this team for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stepped it up at the important times. That's huge, when a
young guy knows the situation, wants to be a big part of the
success of the club. These two guys really wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton was the first player a visibly emotional Bourque
embraced after Game 6 ended.
</P>
<P>
   Although the second-year center asserted himself in the regular
season with 16 goals and 25 assists, the playoffs offered another
opportunity to make up for a forgettable rookie campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Thornton has more than met the postseason challenges.
Against Carolina, he picked up one goal, four assists, and
increasing confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's first assist came in Boston's losing Game 3 effort,
when he found Sergei Samsonov for a tying goal. In Game 4, Thornton
was responsible for the chip pass that caught Irbe off guard and
allowed Landon Wilson to score the game's decisive goal, on a power
play. Thornton notched a second assist less than 10 minutes later
on Steve Heinze's insurance goal.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Sunday night's winner, Thornton's feed to Carter in
the second overtime of Game 5 was the center's most important
playoff contribution. The flip pass set up Carter's winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never experienced going past the first round,'' said
Thornton. ``I think experience-wise that's going to be very
important. A lot of us in here are so young. After we taste some of
this, I think we'll want more.''
</P>
<P>
   After being the No. 1 overall pick in the 1997 entry draft,
Thornton struggled through a rookie year of limited ice time and
little production (3 goals, 4 assists). The Bruins organization
preached patience, but it was clear the grace period would be only
a year. Thornton spent the summer working on strength and
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a season when I didn't get too many points and I didn't
play too much, I wanted to make this year better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, his presence and contributions in the Carolina series
made the concerned and critical voices of the past seem very
distant.
</P>
<P>
   And he certainly was in sync with the power-play unit. Unlike
other times in the series when the FleetCenter fans would
frantically yell, ``Shoot! shoot!'' each time a Bruin got the puck
on a power play, an air of anticipation hung quietly over the
crowd. They were mesmerized by the crisp passes, the thwack of
rubber meeting wood. They remained confident the Bruins would
score.
</P>
<P>
   With Thornton's goal, the patience paid off.

JOCKEY ANTLEY RIDES HIGH AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Racing can be like a roller coaster. You win,
you lose. You're up, you're down. But perhaps no one in the history
of the sport went from the bottom to the top faster than jockey
Chris Antley, who was out of racing until two months ago but came
back to win last Saturday's Kentucky Derby aboard Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Antley, 33, was a sensational apprentice on the Maryland
circuit, then moved to Monmouth Park in New Jersey, where he won
riding titles from 1984-86. In '85, he led the nation with 469
victories, 39 of them coming in stakes. He moved to New York in
'87, and in '89 established a record by riding at least one winner
on every card for 64 consecutive racing days. He captured his first
Kentucky Derby aboard Strike the Gold in '91.
</P>
<P>
   However, Antley, who is from Monrovia, Calif., had problems with
substance abuse, including a positive drug test in '88. He moved
his tack to California in 1994, and slowly began to fade from the
picture. He wound up at Woodbine in Toronto, did not enjoy racing
in Canada, and called it quits early in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While on the sidelines, Antley's biggest problem became his
weight. His normal riding weight is 114 pounds, but Antley went up
to 147. When he decided to make a comeback, he embarked on a
vigorous diet and exercise program, which included long runs, and
he made his return to the races in early March at California.
</P>
<P>
   Racing can be about redemption, too. And trainer D. Wayne Lukas
specifically picked Antley off the scrap heap, asking a jockey who
had overcome a weight problem, to handle Charismatic, whom Lukas
described as ``a big, fat horse that wants to run every two
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the Demolition Derby, rougher than usual, and Antley
rode a smart race, keeping Charismatic, who broke from post No. 16,
wide and out of trouble. When he put the chestnut son of Summer
Squall _ who had been plodding along in seventh place _ into gear,
Charismatic came running, exploding past the 16th-pole to take a
clear lead.
</P>
<P>
   With about 20 yards to go, Antley raised his left index finger
toward the sky, riding only with his right hand, and upsetting the
purists. But he had the wire measured, and Charismatic held off the
late-charging Menifee by a neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pointing to God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Antley, who came a long way to regain the spotlight, ranked this
Derby win higher than his score in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has a lot more sentimental value, probably more than
anything I've done in my career, by far,'' he said. ``I've had
things handed to me, and always been able to come back quick, or
get through hard times. This was a little bit of a role reversal,
in the sense that I couldn't just come back nonchalant. I had to
find the depths of myself to be able to get back. So this was
something special. There was a lot of work done to get here.''

   Baffert tips cap
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert missed his chance to become the first man to train
three consecutive Derby winners, as his charges finished fourth
(Prime Timber), fifth (the filly Excellent Meeting), and 11th
(General Challenge). However, Baffert was gracious after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne Lukas is the trainer of the '90s,'' he said. ``He should
have been in the Hall of Fame a long time ago (Lukas was elected
last Tuesday). The guy is tough. He's a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   All three of Baffert's horses got beaten up in the melee that
was the 125th Run for the Roses, giving him something of an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for me to get into the Derby this year because of
the 20 horses,'' said Baffert. ``It becomes a crapshoot. You still
need a good horse, but you need so much luck. I've been really
lucky all these years because I got the trip. Saturday, I couldn't
get the trip with any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Challenge's eyes were full of dirt and stuff. The poor
guy. He probably took the worst of it of all of them. He's all
right, but he looked like he was dragging his hind leg a little
bit. He probably strained himself. Excellent Meeting ran
unbelievable. She was, like, dead last and she came 10-wide. She
was so wide coming for home, and she still only got beat about 3
lengths. Prime Timber was pretty tired after the race. He had a
little bit of a rough trip, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Derby turned into a war, Baffert was glad he didn't
run his other top filly, the smallish Silverbulletday, who won the
Oaks on Friday in a bravura performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the plan Mike (Pegram, the owner) and I were using:
Don't run her in a 20-horse field,'' said Baffert. ``She could have
been in there getting knocked around.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dosage diminished
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest loser in the Derby was the Dosage Index.
Dosage is a calculation purported to measure a thoroughbred's
ability to run 1 1/4 miles on the first Saturday in May. If a horse
is above 4.00 on the Dosage Index, he/she is supposed to be a
throw-out in the Derby. This year, Dosage took a double dip, as the
Derby produced a nonqualifier perfecta; Charismatic had a Dosage of
5.22, and Menifee a Dosage of 5.50. The Dosage theory suffered a
crack in '91, when Strike the Gold became the first to win the
Derby without being a qualifier, which was a big deal at the time.

BLEDSOE SALUTES KRAFT'S SETTLING OF STADIUM ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ When it comes to the future of the New
England Patriots, Drew Bledsoe knows better than to take anything
but his bulging paycheck to the bank. But he may finally breathe
easier now that the team appears destined to stay in Foxborough,
where a $250 million state-of-the-art facility may be ready by
2002, when the quarterback will turn 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I took the `for sale' sign down,'' kidded Bledsoe about
the multimillion-dollar house he recently moved into in Medfield.
``I'm looking to be in the area for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief for a couple of reasons. I really wanted to stay
here, No. 1. We've built a strong fan base here. We have a good
following. Most of those people would have followed us to
Connecticut. But this makes it easier. And No. 2, we've started to
establish roots here as a family _ built a house _ and it would be
tough to pick up and move.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe spoke to Patriots owner Robert Kraft at times during the
abortive Hartford courtship, but said, ``He wasn't at liberty to
say much. I congratulated him when the Connecticut offer came in
and I spoke to him now and then only because we like to know what's
going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great offer. The credit goes to Mr. Kraft to walk
away from the financial windfall and do what he thought was the
right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things I know about Mr. Kraft is he wants to win football
games first and foremost, that's the reason we need the new
facility, to be competitive financially in order for him to give
out signing bonuses and be creative with the contracts. We've got
to have luxury box revenue. And all along he wanted to have
something here in his home state. When that was no longer an
option, then he looked at the next-best option, which was to go to
Connecticut and keep it in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe thinks few people would have taken the road Kraft did.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about it: If somebody offers you five times what
you're making to go someplace else but you decide to stay because
you think it's the right thing to do? That's commendable,'' he
said. ``There aren't many people who would make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe thought back to 1993, when he first saw the Foxboro
Stadium facility as the Patriots' No. 1 draft pick out of
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' he recalled. ``In college, our facilities
were about the worst in the Pac-10, and we had far better
facilities then what we had here, which was really surprising for a
professional football team. To have one grass practice field and a
50-yard bubble . . . it's really ridiculous when you think about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the reaction a lot of guys have when they visit here.
When you think about it, in order to attract free agents, you're
going to have to pay them more or find another way to attract them
here. You almost want to bring them to Boston and not show them the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Jim Harbaugh came in my rookie year. They talked
about bringing him in as my mentor. And he was just dumbfounded
that we had to put on our pads and drive to practice at the mental
institution (Wrentham State School). You come back and we had a pop
machine in the locker room at that time and you actually had to put
money into it to get a Coke. So many things are ridiculous about
this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe and other players have certainly put the bug in Kraft's
ear about the facilities in other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go to places to play and visiting areas are nicer than
what we have, I'll go to Mr. Kraft and say, `This is pretty nice,'
'' said Bledsoe. ``Being a competitive guy, I would think he would
want to have something just as nice if not better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe never saw the stadium issue as a distraction to the
team. He also knows that, because of the way things are in the NFL
now, there may be only 10-12 current Patriots who will be around to
play in the new facility.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe and his wife, Maura, who are expecting their second
child any day, had talked about a game plan if the team moved to
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I wasn't going to commute,'' said Bledsoe. ``It was
too much to ask to have her up here by herself. We were trying to
decide, do we buy a new place or just rent a place until I decided
to retire in a few years?
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side of it is when we were talking about Hartford,
they were talking 2002, which I took to mean 2004 and 2005. With
the way things tend to go with big construction projects everywhere
_ my own house is a year and half late _ I took the attitude that
when the moving vans moved up and packed things up, we were moving
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he harbor any fear that the Massachusetts plan won't come
off?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take the same attitude,'' he said. ``I'd love to
play in a new facility in Foxborough. I'll believe it when it
happens.''

BRUINS MAKING BELIEVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Remember what I was tellin' you? Remember how I told
you the Bruins were gonna be all right, and how they had a
goaltender who could kick 'em out with anybody (any American and
Canadian, anyway) and how the kids were gonna fool everybody and
Joe Thornton was gonna be a huge hero before too long and how it
would be wise to remember that Ray Bourque is 38 going on 28 and
would be there when you needed him, like, say, in his 54th minute
of a double OT game and how one place the Bruins were absolutely in
as good shape as anybody in the league was the coaching department?
Remember all that?
</P>
<P>
   Now, exactly when was I tellin' you all this? Thanksgiving?
Christmas? The day the pitchers and catchers reported? Marathon
Day? OK, not quite. It was last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   I'm 'fessing up. I have come a little late to this party. But
I'm here to tell you that the puckhead experts among us weren't so
sure of anything about a week ago, when the Bruins were down to the
Carolina Hurricanes, two games to one. Don't let any of them
attempt to slip some jive by you. They looked at the Hurricanes and
all they could see was Keith Primeau flying around and Gary Roberts
nailing people and Ray Sheppard continually in the right place at
the right time, with a little Arturs Irbe thrown in. They thought
the Bruins might just be too small and too professionally immature
to beat a veteran team like Carolina in a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   That was before a stirring victory in Game 4 and an exhausting
and thoroughly satisfying road triumph in the epic Game 5 and the
solidly commanding performance in Game 6. The Bruins have won a
playoff series for the first time in five years. They also have the
Big Mo going for them after what they did in Games 4, 5, and 6.
</P>
<P>
   It is now official. Thanks to this Bruins team, we now know it
most certainly is possible for a Boston winter professional sports
team to derive the benefit of a home court/ice appearance. The
Celtics are only dimly aware of this fact, but the Bruins now know
it to be true. You could not ask for much more support than the
FleetCenter crowd has given the newly beloved Bruins these past
three games.
</P>
<P>
   It is absolutely chilling how fast things can change in sport.
Before the Carolina series, the Bruins had not played before a
capacity crowd for a playoff game in the FleetCenter. You kind of
thought they had warranted the maximum level of support following
the kind of season _ and especially the kind of finish _ they had,
but with prices in all sports the way they are these days, no one
ever can fault people for opting to take in the game on radio or
TV.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not suggesting we're back in the early '70s, but we are back
where the Bruins used to be in the Garden. The diehards never left,
of course, but the fence-sitters are back, and with good reason.
The Bruins are putting on a great show.
</P>
<P>
   How far can they go? The best answer is ``as far as anybody else
in the East.'' There are no absolutes in this side of the draw.
There are no absolutes, and no great teams, either. Spectacular
individuals? Oh, sure. Perhaps you've heard of chaps named Jagr and
Hasek. They don't come any better. The former might be the best
player in the game, period, and the latter is now the standard by
which all goalkeepers are being judged. If the Fates so decree, the
Bruins might be facing Mr. Hasek in the next series and, if they
were so fortunate as to win, Mr. Jagr in the series after that. But
neither plays for a great team.
</P>
<P>
   This team already has accomplished something by winning a
playoff series. It was the primary goal for the 1998-99 Boston
Bruins, a team populated by young players who never had known the
taste of Stanley Cup victory in any form. Now they have it, and it
has to taste even better than they imagined because these guys
truly earned it by winning three games in a row when the doubts
were starting to creep in.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have a chance to be something even better. They can
stop being a pesky team and become a downright dangerous one. There
is a berth in the Stanley Cup finals open to anyone and everyone
left in the tournament. New Jersey is the team with the most
credentials, but the Devils don't scare anybody, as evidenced by
the fact that they have to play Pittsburgh in a Game 7. No matter
who the Bruins wind up playing, they will do so with justifiable
confidence. You will be reading and hearing that the Bruins can
beat anyone they play in the East, and can do so in any building,
and it all will be true. They really can.
</P>
<P>
   They really are likable, even lovable the way they're playing
now. It's easy to root for the kids, the budding stars such as
Jason Allison, Anson Carter, and Joe Thornton, to name three. It's
also easy to root for a guy like Steve Heinze, who kept his mouth
shut when his playing time was cut and who responded when called
upon in the Carolina series with timely goals and clever assists.
It is very easy to root for goaltender Byron Dafoe, who continually
has given his team an edge in this most demanding of all sports
positions. It shouldn't be too dfficult to pull for a quiet,
dependable veteran like Don Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is The Captain. If there ever was someone who led
by example . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics soon will be done. The Red Sox, in case you haven't
figured it out, will not be a factor. The Patriots won't be showing
up for 2 1/2 months. The spotlight is now trained on the Bruins. I
told ya so. No, really. I was spouting off pretty good right after
Game 4.

TRIPLE CROWN BIDS WILL BE A HORSE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charismatic's improbable victory in last Saturday's Kentucky
Derby whetted the appetites of networks vying to buy the television
rights to the Triple Crown races.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, CBS, and Fox will be at the table this fall when
negotiations are supposed to begin for the rights now held by ABC.
The Disney-owned network is paying about $9 million per year for
all three races, including about $5 million for the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good price for all three. Thirty-second ad spots during
the races range from $125,000 for the Derby to to $85,000 for the
Preakness to $65,000 for the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   And the ratings are solid. Saturday's race earned a 6.6 national
rating, not bad for a Saturday afternoon. Last year's number was a
6.7. But the problem is that, for the first time in the '90s, the
Derby did not have competition from the NBA playoffs. So the rating
is not a good sign. It means the Derby has a solid core of fans but
has been unable to capture the eyes of casual observers.

   Industry sources suggest that NBC is eager to add the Triple
Crown to its package of horse races, which includes most notably
the Breeders' Cup. Another reason is that NBC could promote the
races during the NBA playoffs. Fox has the money and a strong horse
racing lineup, but not even Rupert Murdoch wants to throw money
away.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has the rights for another year, and doesn't plan on giving
them up without a fight. Despite recent cost-cutting moves at
Disney, ABC spokesman Mark Mandel said retaining the Triple Crown
is a ``major priority.''

   The Bruins pulled in good numbers for their first playoff series
victory since 1994. Their 2-0 clincher over the Hurricanes Sunday
night on Channel 38 earned an 11 rating and 16 share, peaking
during the last 15 minutes at a 15.6 rating and 23 share. Friday
night's double-overtime game, also on Channel 38, pulled an 8.4
rating and 15 share, but the overall numbers don't do justice to
the game. From 10:45-11:30 p.m., it earned a 12 rating and 27
share, peaking at 11:15 p.m. with a 12.6 rating and 24 share. The
ratings show again that Boston fans turn on the tube when the home
team is winning. It doesn't hurt to play on the East Coast, either.
The Red Sox-A's game in Oakland late Friday night mustered only a 3
rating and 8 share on Channel 56. The game peaked at 12:15 a.m.
with a 4 rating and 12 share, but viewership dropped significantly
thereafter . . . Boston viewers aren't showing a lot of love to the
NBA. Sunday afternoon's doubleheader attracted barely 44,000
household viewers. The first game, Knicks-Pacers, earned a 1.9
rating and 7 share. The second game, Jazz-Spurs, pulled a 1.4
rating and 4 share.

   The Sunday late-night shows produced the usual numbers. ``Sports
Final'' on Channel 4 earned a 4.7 and beat Channel 7's ``Sports
Xtra,'' which had a 3.1. The untold story is that Channel 5 earned
about a 6 rating for its ``ER'' rerun between 11:30 p.m. and
midnight. The hourlong show pulled a 5.7 overall rating, leading
into George Michael's sports show, which earned a 3.9 rating.
Channel 7 executives must be wondering how to keep viewers tuned in
Sunday nights. Their news at 11 p.m. beats out the competiton, but
the sports show can't hold the audience . . . CNN/SI's ``Sports
Tonight,'' hosted by Fred Hickman and Vince Cellini, has gotten a
little bump in its 11-11:30 p.m. ratings. It pulled a .5 for the
month of April, or an average of 359,000 households. Last April,
the number was .3, or 224,000 households. The increase comes at a
time when Fox Sports has poured millions into Keith Olbermann
promotions and ESPN continues its dominance . . . Speaking of the
cable sports giant, Mickey Mantle is the ``SportsCentury''
37th-greatest athlete.

 &HT;    SENATE DUCKS CONTROVERSY ON BALKAN WAR
 &HT;    390&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate, dodging a near-certain rebuff of
President Clinton's handling of the Balkan war, Tuesday shelved a
resolution authorizing the use of ``all necessary force'' against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 78-22 for a motion by Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., to table the measure, killing it without a vote on
the merits.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of the White House, Republican and Democratic
leaders locked arms to block the resolution sponsored by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., who has been pressing Clinton for more forceful
steps to assure victory in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a presidential hopeful for 2000, bitterly attacked the
White House for opposing his resolution even though it would have
broadened Clinton's powers and permitted him to deploy ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States is prepared to lose a war
rather than do the hard work, the politically risky work, of
fighting it as the leader of the greatest nation on Earth should
fight when our interests and values are imperiled,'' he charged.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters, including senators from both parties, had
conceded that the measure did not have a majority. The White House
and its backers feared a potential embarrassment if the Senate had
voted against expanding Clinton's authority in conducting the war.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, a critic of the U.S. policy in the Balkans, said he wanted
to avoid a divisive vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the resolution was ``out of sync with current events''
because the Clinton administration has not sought authority to
expand the conflict beyond the current bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's resolution provoked the most extended debate in the
Senate over the air war since it began six weeks ago and revealed
deep divisions about the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is left to us, as our war on the cheap fails to achieve
the objectives for which we went to war?'' McCain said. He
ridiculed the idea of a bombing pause, which Clinton said Monday he
would consider. Recalling his five years as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam, McCain said more bombing, not bombing pauses, had secured
his eventual release.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, called for a
five-day moratorium in the bombing campaign. ``I think it's worth a
try,'' she said, calling on Clinton to take a ``bold step'' in
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some senators, including Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., invoked images
of World War II to argue for U.S. military involvement on behalf of
the victims of Serbian ethnic cleansing. ``The objectives are
extremely reasonable and just,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others, including Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., heard echoes of
the Vietnam war. There is ``no strategy to win, no exit strategy,''
and ``most of the planes and troops are American,'' said Cleland,
an Army veteran who was severely injured in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House sent contradictory messages by failing to
muster a majority to support the ongoing bombing campaign in the
Balkans but refusing to vote to withdraw the forces.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, the House is expected to approve an emergency
spending bill of $12.9 billion, double the amount sought by the
White House for the Balkan effort. Senate action on the funding is
expected next week.

CALIFORNIA EXECUTES DECORATED VETERAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN QUENTIN, Calif. _ A decorated ex-Marine who said he was
having a Vietnam combat flashback when he murdered a Sacramento
woman nearly two decades ago was executed at San Quentin Prison
Tuesday after last-minute legal efforts to save his life failed.
</P>
<P>
   The final words of Manuel Pina Babbitt, delivered to San Quentin
Warden Jeanne Woodford, were, ``I forgive all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled 12:01 a.m. execution was delayed for nearly 30
minutes as the U.S. Supreme Court considered his final appeal,
which the court rejected without comment.
</P>
<P>
   The death warrant for Babbitt, who turned 50 on Monday, was read
at 12:29 a.m., followed immediately by the lethal injection. He was
declared dead at 12:37 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt became the seventh killer executed in California since
the state resumed capital punishment seven years ago after a hiatus
of more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first African-American executed by the state in that
period; his supporters argued to the end that he was represented at
trial by a racist and drunken lawyer and that the victim,
prosecutor, public defender and jury were all white.
</P>
<P>
   But John Rizzotti, a great-grandson of Babbitt's victim, Leah
Schendel, called the execution a justifiable death that was ``the
only way to end my family's 18-year nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schendel family, in a statement read by Laura Thompson, Leah
Schendel's granddaughter, said, ``We know that nothing will bring
Leah Schendel back to us but we feel that we have done everything
in our power to see that justice was done in her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel as always that the only proper response to capital
crime is to demand the highest penalty for the taking of innocent
lives,'' she said. ``From the beginning all we have ever asked for
is justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine members of the Schendel family, mostly grandchildren and
great-grandchildren of the victim, witnessed the execution. William
Babbitt, who turned his brother into the police 18 years ago, also
was a witness.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's denial capped a parade of appeals that has
become part of the execution night ritual.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Manuel Babbitt's appeals were turned down by the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and by the California Supreme Court.
Gov. Gray Davis, a fellow veteran of the Vietnam war, denied
Babbitt's clemency appeal on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt spent his last hours meditating in a death watch cell
only steps away from the chamber where an unidentified doctor
administered a lethal cocktail of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He had fasted for two days and skipped the traditional last
meal, prison officials said. He asked that his last meal go to a
homeless veteran, but prison officials rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would like to die with dignity,'' one of his defense
attorneys, Charles Patterson, said. ``He said to me at one time
that God has different ways of calling us home and this is the way
he's chosen for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The drugs injected intravenously were sodium pentothal to put
Babbitt to sleep, pancuronium bromide to arrest his breathing and
potassium chloride to stop his heart. It took the drugs a little
more than seven minutes to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   The doomed man showed no emotion when the curtain to the small
death chamber was drawn to allow witnesses to see. Several minutes
after the injections, his chest sharply convulsed, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 700 anti-capital punishment demonstrators gathered in the
windy cold outside San Quentin until the death was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The vigil was peaceful and unlike previous executions, there
appeared to be no pro-death penalty demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the demonstrators were other Vietnam veterans, including
Larry Yepez, who carried his Marine uniform from his home in
Lathrop, Calif. ``I know what he went through,'' Yepez said. ``I
woke up today and I knew I had to go out of respect. No matter what
he did, we're brother Marines and brother post-traumatic stress
syndrome victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt was convicted of robbing, attempting to rape and
murdering Schendel, who was 78, during a burglary in her Sacramento
apartment in December 1980. Schendel died of a heart attack during
the assault, which included a beating so savage it cleaved her
forehead to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   In death-row interviews, Babbitt said he did not doubt that he
killed the woman but had no memory of it.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers argued that he may have been suffering from
post-traumatic stress, or shell shock, from his experiences in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters said he had suffered from mental illness since he
was a child and the pressure of made him crack even more.
</P>
<P>
   While on death row, Babbitt was awarded a Purple Heart for his
wounds suffered during the 77-day siege of Khe Sanh. The outcry
from the Schendel family and the public ended such prison
ceremonies.

FOR WITNESSES TO AN EXECUTION, SOMBER END TO LONG ORDEAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN QUENTIN, Calif. _ Although an execution in California has
become somewhat uneventful, even routine, it is an event that is
still hard to watch.
</P>
<P>
   As Manuel Pina Babbitt, 50, started convulsing early Tuesday,
his head and chest lifting several times and his restraints barely
able to keep him on the table, Laura Thompson, the granddaughter of
Babbitt's murder victim, could not watch.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes were cast downward as Babbitt, straps across his arms,
chest and legs and handcuffs around his wrists, heaved
dramatically, minutes after a lethal injection began coursing
through his veins.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt was the seventh person executed at San Quentin in the
last seven years. Prison authorities ran the proceedings without a
hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The only delay was caused by a last-minute appeal to the Supreme
Court, which denied Babbitt's motion for a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A guard read the death warrant at 12:29 a.m. About 15 witnesses
were seated in a semi-circle around the hexagonal-shaped death
chamber. More witnesses stood on risers in the back of the small
room.
</P>
<P>
   When the guard declared, ``The execution shall now proceed,''
two other guards pulled back the dainty white curtains to reveal
the small chamber, painted an inappropriately cheerful sea green.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt lay calmly, his head moving a few times. Two catheters
were in his arms, the tubes extending to the room behind the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The handcuffs had not been used in previous executions.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Vernell Crittendon would say only that they
were necessary for security but said Babbitt had not been
uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has stated unequivocally that Babbitt deserved
execution for murdering her grandmother, Leah Schendel. At a
clemency hearing last week, she said Babbitt's death would not be
nearly as agonizing as her grandmother's.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt was convicted of robbing, attempting to rape and
murdering Schendel, who was 78, during a burglary in her Sacramento
apartment in December 1980. Schendel died of a heart attack during
the assault, which included a beating so savage it cleaved her
forehead to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   At the execution Thompson was surrounded by eight other family
members, mostly Schendel's grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Many of them held hands as Babbitt lay dying in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the convulsions stopped, Babbitt stopped breathing.
The room was quiet for several minutes as the witnesses watched the
motionless body.
</P>
<P>
   The only noise was the dull thumping of old pipes in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   John Rizzotti, Schendel's oldest great-grandson, turned to the
young woman next to him and mouthed, ``You OK?'' She nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Although Babbitt wanted none of his relatives to watch him die,
he finally relented, allowing his older brother William, who turned
Babbitt into the police 18 years ago, to witness the execution.
William Babbitt had indicated he wanted to be with his brother up
until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a sweat shirt with the hood pulled over his head and his
hands in his pockets, he stood off to the side during the eight
minutes it took his brother to die. Some witnesses said he appeared
to be smiling slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The only other witness Babbitt allowed was Charles Patterson, a
Los Angeles lawyer worked without compensation on the case for more
than three years. Patterson, a fellow Marine and, like Babbitt, a
survivor of the bloody siege at Khe Sanh, said his law firm had put
more than $1 million into defending Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   The last time San Quentin had an event for Babbitt was last
year. He was awarded a Purple Heart for his service in Vietnam,
where he fought countless Viet Cong and saw fellow Americans die.

LANGUAGE SCHOOLS DRAW STUDENTS LOOKING TO CONQUER FLUENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the world's great cities are vertical, like New York,
others horizontal, like Los Angeles, and still others, like this
elegantly faded former Spanish citadel, are layered.
</P>
<P>
   Dig down through the substrata of petrified brick and bone and
you'll stumble upon half-forgotten cultural identities, stacked one
upon another like shale. In Cuernavaca, as in most of Mexico,
European culture has been superimposed over a pre-Columbian past,
creating a topsoil that is rich with history and memory. The
provincial capital of Morelos, one of Mexico's smallest and most
affluent states, Cuernavaca is 1-1/2 hours by car from the
aggressive sprawl and toxic air of Mexico City, which sits on the
other side of a volcanic mountain range, 50 miles away. Located
within a half-day's drive of the white-sand beaches of Acapulco,
plus a number of fascinating, historic hill towns such as the
exquisite colonial silver-mining village of Taxco and the
mysterious Tepoztlan, legendary birthplace of the serpent god
Quetzalcoat, Cuernavaca makes an ideal base camp or jumping-off
point for virtually all of Central Mexico. Blessed with a
springlike climate so benign that it makes even Southern
California's seem surly by comparison, Cuernavaca has long been a
favorite haunt of Mexico's rich and powerful. The British writer
Malcolm Lowry captured its lingering ambience of post-colonial
decadence in his incendiary 1947 novel ``Under the Volcano,'' which
John Huston made into a 1984 feature film. On clear days, you can
make out the distant apparition of Popocatepetl
(po-po-ka-TEH-pettle), the 5,452-meter volcanic peak whose most
recent outburst _ in December 1994 - sent thousands of tons of
molten ash leaping into the night sky. As the city has grown, so
has its share of urban ills. Car and bus fumes can be oppressive at
times, especially along the main commercial drag of Avenida
Morelos. Shanty towns, some of whose residents lack water and
electricity, dot Cuernavaca's outskirts. Both lush and gritty,
cosmopolitan and backward-looking, this shabby-genteel metropolis
of 316,000 embodies many of Mexico's charms, as well as its
troubling contradictions. Subhed: In search of fluency
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I had come to Cuernavaca mainly to improve our
written and spoken Spanish, which we'd been studying on and off for
the previous five years. As residents of the nation's most
Latinized state, we planned to hone our skills at one of the 18 or
so Spanish-language schools that have burst like bougainvillea
throughout Cuernavaca during the past three decades. After thumbing
through numerous brochures, we'd settled on Cemanahuac Educational
Community, an accredited 25-year-old program run by Charles Goff
and Harriet Goff Guerrero, an exptriate American brother and
sister, and their respective spouses. The school employs some 25
language teachers, more during the peak summer months, and a small
but highly efficient administrative staff.
</P>
<P>
   Offering classes and lectures in Mexican history, politics and
culture, as well as its core Spanish-language curriculum,
Cemanahuac (pronounced seh-man-NOW-wac) caters to all kinds:
business executives needing basic conversational skills; Pacific
Northwest farmers desiring to converse more freely with their
migrant help; teachers; journalists; social service workers; Peace
Corps volunteers; retirees looking for something besides golf and
bridge to fill their golden years; and large contingents of college
studets from Ohio, Minnesota and Massachusetts. Students are
tested for proficiency upon arrival, and may enroll and study for
as many weeks as time and budget permit. Like most Cemanahuac
students, we opted to stay with a local family, which supplied our
clean, comfortable room and three meals a day at a modest cost.
Bilingual conversations during the large midday comida (dinner)
were among the most pleasant parts of our daily ritual.
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of our time in Cuernavaca was spent in classes -
the school offers instruction of between four and eight hours
daily, five days a week - we found ample opportunity on weekends to
explore the surrounding region and test our rough-hewn Spanish with
the unfailingly kind and good-humored locals. Subhed: Small-scale
metropolis
</P>
<P>
   Carved out of a high-desert valley, 5,280 feet above sea level,
Cuernavaca is in some ways a miniature version of the nation's
teeming capital. It boasts tranquil parks and boisterous
nightclubs, a number of good, inexpensive rstaurants (particularly
by U.S. standards), and several economical if unluxurious hotels.
There's also one world-class getaway, the hotel Las Mananitas,
where haughty peacocks patrol the parklike grounds and every blade
of grass looks separately sculpted. The region's pre-Columbian
roots date at least to the early 13th century, when Indians began
establishing farms and villages. Soon the area came under the
dominion of the Aztecs, irresistible warriors who exacted steep
tributes from their conquered neighbors. The Spanish conquistador
Hernan Cortes passed through Cuernavaca en route to his brutal
rendezvous with destiny in the great Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan
(now Mexico City). He routed the local Tlahuica Indians, burned
their village, tore down their main pyramid, and used its stones to
construct two massive edifices: a palace and the Catedral de la
Asuncion.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a slice of Cuernavaca's indigenous past has been
preserved at the Piramide deTeopanzolco, a walk-in archaeological
site, which is actually two pyramids in one. The first, built
around A.D. 1200, later was surrounded by the walls of the newer
temple. A related complex of low stone platforms, including some
where human remains were discovered, apparently was used for
religious practices, including ritual sacrifice. After sacking
Tenochtitlan and subjugating what was left of the 10 million-strong
Aztec empire, Cortes settled down in Cuernavaca to preside over the
extensive estate he'd been granted by the Spanish crown. Today, the
sturdy Palacio de Cortes, dating from 1523, houses an interesting
museum of pre-Hispanic and Spanish culture, the Museo de
Cuauhnahuac. It also anchors the southeast corner of Cuernavaca's
zocalo, orcentral plaza, also known as the Plaza de Armas or Plaza
de la Constitucion. Guarded by a gargantuan statue of Jose Maria
Morelos (1765-1815), a mixed-raced priest who became a leader of
Mexico's 19th-century war of independence from Spain, the zocalo is
a place to meet friends, listen to free mariachi music on Tuesday
nights or have a drink at one of the numerous open-air cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately to the northwest of the zocalo lies the smaller
Jardin Juarez (Juarez Garden). Its central landmark is a green
gazebo designed by Gustave Eiffel, architect of Paris' famous
tower, where bands play on Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Subhed: Cultural crossroad
</P>
<P>
   If you really want a respite, head further west across Avenidea
Morelos and enter the Jardin Borda, a tranquil if somewhat
worn-at-the-heels urban oasis. Built in 1783, the gardens, filled
with many varieties of tropical trees and plants, form part of a
silver magnate's estate. The poinsettia-lined paths will bring you
to a colonnaded outdoor pool, where you can feed the swans or take
one of the small rental rowboats for a spin. The gardens are
attached to a colonial-style house that also contains a museum and
several small art galleries. During the imperialist French
occupation of Mexico (1864-67), the Emperor Maximillian
occasionally used the estate as a summer retreat, where he'd
indulge in frequent liaisons with his Indian mistress.
</P>
<P>
   Directly across Morelos from the gardens is the immense walled
compound that encompasses the city's hulking cathedral, the Templo
de la Asuncion de Maria. This imposing, workmanlike structure,
built in the 1520s with Indian labor under Franciscan supervision,
is flanked by the Capilla Abierta de San Jose, an open-air chapel
thatis reputedly the oldest colonial Spanish structure still
standing in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Cuernavaca houses a handful of great artworks, notably the
superb Diego Rivera murals that grace the elegant Palacio Cortes.
Sweeping from right to left, they depict the violent history of the
Spanish conquest, the War of Independence and the Revolution that
set the course of Mexican politics for the 20th century. Painted in
1929 and 1930, the murals were the gift of then U.S. ambassador to
Mexico Dwight Morrow, father of Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the wife of
aviator Charles Lindbergh. Tucked just a few blocks east of the
cathedral is the Robert Brady Museum. Named for an independently
wealthy American artist and collector who lived 24 years in
Cuernavaca, this beautifully restored villa is stuffed with Brady's
personal art collection. It includes paintings by such well-known
modern Mexican artists as Frida Kahlo and Rufino Tamayo, as well as
masks, sculptures and curios from Africa, New Guinea, Bali and
elsewhere. Slightly out of the way, but worth a visit, is the
taller, or studio, once belonging to the great Mexican
painter-muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. Located in a bohemian
enclave, it's now a museum housing a photo display of the artist's
life, as well as four monumental murals he was working on at the
time of his death. Many of Cuernavaca's private treasures are
hidden behind gated walls, guarded by jealous attack dogs. But at
least two of its grandest residences are largely open to the
public. The Hacienda de San Antonio Atlacomulco, about three miles
southeast of the center, is a cavernous former colonial villa
reborn as a beautifully manicured hotel. Not far away, but
definitely way-out, is he Sumiya hotel, which was originally built
by Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton. It's a Japanese fantasy, made
with rocks, tiles and a kabuki theater imported directly from
Japan. So how's our Spanish after a month in Cuernavaca? Let's say
that total fluency remains a long-term goal. But we're still
excavating, digging deeper into a language and a culture that
steadily feels more and more like our own.

   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Although suburban sprawl has begun to push out its borders,
Cuernavaca is still an extremely walkable city, similar in design
to a Tuscan hill town. Most of its principal attractions lie with a
four- or five-block area centered around the zocalo. Here are some
details on places to stay and see. HOTELS: Cuernavaca has a number
of hotels that are nonluxurious but reasonably pleasant and very
inexpensive by U.S. standards. Hotel Espana (18-67-44), at the
intersection of Morelos and Rayon, offers rooms for about $12 to
$14 U.S. The 77-room Hotel Papagayo (14-17-11) costs slightly more
- about $18-$27 U.S. - but its two swimming pools and children's
recreation area make it a good bet. At the higher end of the price
scale, Las Mananitas (14-14-66) is one of the country's top hotels
and a longtime stopover for international celebrities. Rooms go
from $120 U.S. up to $250 for fancy garden suites. Its restaurant,
offering a fine, eclectic mix of international cuisines, is a great
place to splurge on a last-night meal. Plan to spend $20 to $30
U.S. per person (no credit cards). The exotic Camino Real Sumiya
(20-91-99), originally built as a private home by Woolworths
heiress Barbara Hutton, is a gorgeous reproduction of a traditional
Japanese estate, complete with ornamental gardens ad a kabuki
theater. It's slightly out of the way on the city's southern
fringes. Rooms start at $145 U.S. SITES: Around the zocalo: The
Palacio de Cortes and Museo de Cuauhnahuac is open 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays (admission $2 U.S.; free on Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   The Robert Brady Museum, No. 4 Calle Netzahualcoyotl, between
the zocalo and the Templo de la Asuncion de Maria, is open 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays. Admission is $2.50 U.S. The
Jardin Borda and the adjacent Museo de Sitio costs $1 U.S. (free on
Wednesdays) and is open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Tuesdays through
Sundays. You'll probably need to take a taxi to the Piramide
deTeopanzolco, which is east of the city center through streets
that twist endlessly around the old train station. It's open daily
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $2 U.S.; free on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for transportation to Taller Alfaro Siqueiros, the
studio-home of painter and muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, at 52
Venus St. It's open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays
(admission $1 U.S.). RESTAURANTS: For a treat, visit Cafe Hidalgo,
a mustard-colored two-story building on the zocalo's southeast
corner. Entrees such as an excellent vegetarian lasagna are between
$7 and $10 U.S. Creamy artichoke soup garnished with pistachio nuts
is about $3 for a large bowl, with fresh-baked bread on the side.
Be sure to try and get a balcony table. Right next door is the less
expensive Restaurant Los Arcos, a favorite spot for sipping a tall
beer or cafe con leche and observing the surrounding chess players,
news vendors and tourists. Be prepared to be solicited by the
roving Indian street sellers, many of them children, plying
everything from woven baskets and clay figurines to musical
instruments. The kitchen serves up solid traditional Mexican
dishes, sandwiches and full breakfasts. Hours are 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.
La India Bonita, a charming courtyard restaurant a couple of blocks
northeast of the Jardin Borda at Morrow 106, commemorates the
Emperor Maximilian's indigenous mistress. Try the chicken mole,
garnished with the famous Mexican sauce that blends chocolate,
chiles and other tantalizing ingredients.

HAPPY CAMPERS FIND A QUIRKY SHOE THAT FITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They're clompy and quirky and too, too cute.
Above all, they're comfortable, not to mention pricey. They're
Campers, heretofore available only in Europe. And they're invading.
</P>
<P>
   So what are Campers? Athletic shoe? Sandal? Platform? Mismatched
ballerina flat? They're all these in one totally fun piece of
footwear, totally out of the ordinary. Campers, in other words,
look like they've been made by committee.
</P>
<P>
   Plus: They have this very neat-o Web site (www.camper.es) where
you learn about the history of the company, see the styles, ads
(which are as radical as Benetton's) and archives, and even send
the company e-mail missives.
</P>
<P>
   The Camper shoe has its roots in 19th-century Spain on the
island of Mallorca. Artisan-cobbler Antonio Fluxa combined his
artistic sensibilities with English technology _ on a trip to
Britain, he got his first Goodyear sewing machine _ and built an
extended family of shoemakers working in independent workshops all
over the island. Antonio's son, Lorenzo, continued the tradition
and Lorenzo's son, also Lorenzo, created the Camper shoe brand in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the loosey-goosey post-hippie sensibilities of island
living (a kind of waste-not, want-not philosophy of using recycled
materials like truck tires, canvas and hemp thread) with the needs
of his customers (those who eschewed automobiles and preferred to
walk around Mallorca; those who loved soccer; those who needed
shoes to wear to the beach). Campers are a quirky combination of
art and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quirky? You bet,'' said Rita Hurault, a preschool teacher in
Oakland, Calif. ``Mine are unmatched.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Hardy's first pair of Campers are 2 years old already and
they're so durable, they hardly look worn. They are bright yellow
futbol shoes called ``pelotas,'' which Hardy bought in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend came back from shopping one day with shoes that were
clunky and had little felt patches with Japanese writing on them,''
Hardy said. ``They were cute. I got my first pair last year when my
husband and I were were in Paris _ the mustard yellow ones. I
bought my second pair in Paris this winter. They're black and heavy
and the shoe is so wide that I bump into things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Fluxa opened his first Campers store in 1982 in
Barcelona, the perfect spot for an idiosyncratic designer
(Barcelona is the city of Gaudi and his eccentric cathedral).
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Paris have bought them in the Campers store in the
Marais district. And now, Campers have come to America, if in
limited supply.
</P>
<P>
   Like olives and anchovies, Campers are definitely an acquired
taste. Those who adore the delicacy (and put up with the
discomfort) of such high-styled shoes as Manolo Blahniks or
Christian Louboutins probably would enjoy the humor of some of the
Camper sandals (one pair is printed with tortellinis on the right
foot and stripes on the left) but might blanch at wearing the
combination Mary Jane/athletic shoe in funereal black that looks
like the creator couldn't decide just what it was he was trying to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clodhopper look was big before Campers,'' said Marjorie
Ingall, a free-lance writer who said she doesn't wear them because
``The heel gapes on me; besides, I am a tightwad and they're
expensive'' ($90 to $160).
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why people love them?'' said Kay Hardy, an attorney
and legal writer. ``They fit wide American feet and when you've
been tromping around Paris for two weeks and go in to try them on
with your swollen feet, they fit.''

BEATNIK ENCLAVE CLINGS TO ITS SCRUFFY CHARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, were he alive and
howling today, certainly would recognize his old San Francisco
stomping grounds, the city's intimate North Beach neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Old friend Lawrence Ferlinghetti still owns the beloved,
avant-garde City Lights Booksellers. Washington Square, where
fellow beat Jack Kerouac would sleep off a hangover or add to the
sweet misery with a bottle of port from neighboring Coit Liquor,
continues to welcome the tired, the tourists, the sun worshipers.
And favored indoor hangouts like Cafe Trieste and the dark,
freewheeling bar Vesuvio still offer java or gin _ pick your poison
_ to all manner of local characters and eccentrics.
</P>
<P>
   But Ginsberg probably wouldn't know quite what to make of the
creeping encroachment of upscale restaurants and tourist traps or
the fact that Columbus Avenue's infamous Condor Club, where
stripper Carol Doda plied her trade through the 1960s, is now a
garish, fern-infested sports bar. No doubt dear Ginsberg would
mutter ``Moloch!'' to that (he wasn't a fan of sports or of women,
but of atmosphere, and the Condor had that in spades) before
shuffling off to Vesuvio for a drink.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, North Beach has retained enough of its scruffy
charm to make visitors forget the Banana Republic and glimpse the
old Bohemian Republic. This is, after all, a neighborhood with no
Starbucks (but scores of stylish coffeehouses), no Gap stores (even
though the chain is based in the Bay Area) and precious few
souvenir shops.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are currently busy fighting Rite Aid, contesting the
pharmacy chain's plans to open a massive outlet across from
Washington Square. (Slogan of choice: Rite Aid, Wrong Place.)
</P>
<P>
   What the neighborhood has embraced in recent years is cuisine,
appropriate enough given North Beach's Italian heritage. Italians
weren't the first to arrive here; Chilean prostitutes beat them by
a good 30 years. But by the end of the 19th century, Italian
culture ruled North Beach. (There is no beach, by the way; the
inlet was filled long ago.)
</P>
<P>
   The area's most famous son is baseball great Joe DiMaggio, who
first was married here and, sadly, recently eulogized here at
Washington Square's Saints Peter and Paul Church. DiMaggio married
Marilyn Monroe at City Hall (both were divorced, so they couldn't
use the church), but posed for their wedding pictures outside the
Washington Square landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Given the long history, you've never been able to walk a dozen
steps anywhere on Columbus Avenue without running into an Italian
restaurant. Some have been here for generations (Fior D'Italia
claims to be the oldest Italian restaurant still operating in the
country, opening its doors, primarily to patrons of a neighboring
brothel, in 1886) and others are shiny, new and innovative.
</P>
<P>
   Your choice ultimately says as much about your palate (i.e., do
you like your pasta to co-exist with its sauce or surrender to it?)
as your bank account. Authenticity often comes with a hefty price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Little Italy is giving way to some newcomers, though, and these
restaurants, as much as anything, are responsible for North Beach's
recent renaissance. Restaurateur Reed Hearon has been the most
innovative in adding some modern-day swank to the area's beatnik
past. His Rose Pistola serves creative regional Italian cuisine to
the accompaniment of evening jazz bands. And the restaurant's menu
features a Ferlinghetti poem on its cover. (Don't worry, squares
can get reservations, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Further down Columbus, smugly stuck in the middle of Broadway's
seedy strip joints, is Hearon's other restaurant, the Black Cat,
affectionately named after an old Bohemian bar-cafe on Montgomery
Street. Upstairs, the restaurant features an eclectic menu that
includes creole cuisine and seafood. Downstairs, in the Blue Bar,
traditional jazz bands contend with preening patrons for the
audience's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Last I checked, the posers were winning.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with that. Half the fun of a
long weekend in North Beach is sharing in the unabashed delight
that people here take in watching each other. Viewing spots of
choice: a park bench in Washington Square, a cafe window seat along
Columbus Avenue or one of the prized outdoor tables at Rose
Pistola. Me, I prefer the restaurant because it combines the area's
two great pastimes _ eating and the contemplation of life's human
parade.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect base camp for this type of North Beach excursion is
the Hotel Boheme. Just up Columbus from City Lights, the hotel sits
within easy walking distance of North Beach's best restaurants, and
when you're eating on the average of something like six meals a
day, proximity is everything. Eat, walk, nap. Eat, walk, nap. These
are the rhythms of the classic San Francisco holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, should you want to make a pilgrimage to Pier 39 (and
its popular sea lion squatters), you'll only have a nine-minute
walk from the hotel. Chinatown is four minutes away in the opposite
direction. It's three minutes to the nearest cable car stop, 10
minutes to Coit Tower. Be warned, though. It's a steep climb to the
tower. You might want to save it until just before lunch to further
prime your appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Location isn't the only reason to stay at the Boheme. Like Rose
Pistola and the Black Cat, this elegant, little 15-room hotel has
spun the neighborhood's past into something original and, yet,
perfectly in step with its surroundings. It's New Old World.
</P>
<P>
   The Boheme's cozy rooms are painted in shades of sage green,
cantaloupe orange and, yes, Bohemian black. Lampshades sport glazed
collages of Beat poetry and jazz sheet music. Warm corridors are
filled with moody, black-and-white photographs of old North Beach
jazz clubs and night life. It's like stepping back in time, only
without the downside of authentic period squalor.
</P>
<P>
   All that's missing are the Beats themselves, but if you open
your window over Columbus Avenue (and despite the considerable
street noise, this is where you should book your room), you may
well hear some solitary figure bellowing free-form verse at the top
of his lungs as he trudges to the nearby bus stop. You can't put a
high enough price on this kind of atmosphere. (Another option:
Close the window.)
</P>
<P>
   From the Boheme, you have to walk, oh, all of five feet to
experience sublime San Francisco. Next door to the hotel,
third-generation bakery Stella Pastry serves a trademarked (yes,
they've gone to the patent office) dessert called sacripantina,
which means, roughly translated from Italian, ``Holy smoke!''
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that that was the response of the Genoan queen who
first tasted the dessert, which combines sponge cake and a delicate
cream made with fresh egg yolks, sweet butter, rum, and Marsala and
sherry wines. No one who tastes it questions the story's
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   But then North Beach specializes in the authenticlly
implausible. How else do you explain that low-rent strippers are
plying their trade at the hungry i, the great club where Lenny
Bruce, Barbra Streisand and Woody Allen made a name for themselves,
while down Broadway at the Condor Club, men are watching satellite
sports instead of naked women following in Carol Doda's dance
steps. There is at least a bronze plaque proclaiming the Condor as
``birthplace of the world's first topless &AMP; bottomless
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   A more delightful incongruity (and one I'd actually recommend
visiting) is Mario's Bohemian Cigar Store. This pocket-size bar,
long a favorite of the Beats and old Sicilians, doesn't sell
cigars. (Heck, you can't even smoke here.) But it does offer
mouth-watering hot meatball and eggplant sandwiches on crisp, fresh
focaccia bread baked at nearby Gloria Bakery. The tiramisu is
popular, too, a good sign given Mario's strong Italian following.
</P>
<P>
   Mario's is but one of a myriad of Beat-related hangouts still
thriving in North Beach. Tosca Cafe has opera on its jukebox and
red vinyl booths for its patrons. Politicos and socialites love
this 80-year-old place but usually hang out in the back room away
from the gawkers.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody gets a free ride, though. One night in the mid-'60s, Bob
Dylan and poets Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti were celebrating North
Beach with one too many of the house specialties (coffeeless
cappuccinos made with steamed milk, brandy and chocolate). The
Tosca bartender threw them out on their ears and wouldn't let them
back in despite Dylan's nasal protestations.  &UR; !ital! &LR; (How does it
feeeeel, indeed.) &UR; !off! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner on William Saroyan Place is Spec's Adler
Museum Cafe, a small dive with maritime flags hung from the ceiling
and shelves filled with bric-a-brac seemingly culled from around
the globe. There is no back room here.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could skip the Beats and Little Italy altogether and walk
over to a relatively new North Beach institution, O'Reilly's, quite
possibly the best Irish pub outside of the Emerald Isle. With its
cobblestone floor and old street lamp imported from Dublin and its
beautiful, antique Celtic glass back bar, O'Reilly's feels like
Ireland, which is precisely the point. Immigrant owner Myles
O'Reilly has created a home away from home for himself, other
immigrants and anyone who has longed to visit Ireland but never had
the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to honor all the great Irish traditions,'' Myles told
me over a Guinness, the dark stout that is not so much poured here
as it is built. (Some 35 kegs of Guinness are consumed each week
here.) Myles has lovingly filled his pub and restaurant with
Irish-related books and pictures and a striking mural of the
country's great authors, including Shaw, Joyce, Yeats and Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of tradition extends to the pub's mascot, an enormous
Irish wolfhound named Fionn who patrols the premises and welcomes
visitors _ when the mood strikes. And since the 185-pound Fionn is
the size of a small pony, he can pretty much do whatever his mood
dictates (which usually involves lying quietly in the corner).
</P>
<P>
   Follow one new North Beach pleasure with another and have dinner
at the House. Situated near the neighboring Chinatown, this
marvelous restaurant appropriately enough combines Eastern and
Western ingredients for a fusion cuisine that is uniquely its own.
Its signature dish is a grilled Chilean sea bass with garlic ginger
soy sauce. The fish practically melts in your mouth, as does the
restaurant's other fresh seafood and noodle dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Would Ginsberg have dined here? Maybe. Maybe not. But with fresh
Chilean sea bass resting warm in your belly for $15, it's not a
question that's likely to linger long in your brain. &QL;

GAY GROUPS SEEK VOTER APPROVAL TO REOPEN BATHHOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A coalition of gay organizations has launched a
ballot campaign to reopen San Francisco's gay bathhouses, which
were ordered closed in October 1984 during the height of the AIDS
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to increase the number of venues where gay people can
practice safe, sensual sodomy,'' said Michael Petrelis of the
organization Queer Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Some two dozen gay bathhouses were closed in 1984 when then
Mayor Dianne Feinstein declared a public health emergency as HIV
infections increased exponentially in the city's homosexual
population. The rationale was that unsafe sex behind locked doors
in the bathhouses was spreading the fatal virus.
</P>
<P>
   Bathhouses have remained closed since, but health officials do
allow sex clubs, where men typically gather in large, common rooms
where employees can check for condom use. Sex clubs are prohibited
from allowing private rooms with locked doors.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Katz, the director of the Department of Public Health,
said it was important to maintain such rules to prevent new HIV
infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that these rules are important to ensure safe
sex,'' Katz said. ``We believe that businesses also have a
responsibility to monitor behaviors in the establishments to ensure
that safe sex is practiced. It's important for us to prevent as
many HIV infections as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus
weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.

   The advocates of reopening bathhouses say San Francisco is
erring too much on the side of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other major metropolitan areas ... and San Jose and Berkeley
all have bathhouses,'' said David Pasquarelli of ACT UP San
Francisco. ``It's time for San Francisco to get with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Pasquarelli, there is no evidence that sex behind
closed doors in bathhouses is inherently less safe than it is in
the more open sex clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the Sexually Transmitted Disease Reduction
Initiative have until July 5 to gather 10,200 signatures to put the
measure on the Nov. 7 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether a ballot initiative, if approved by
voters, would overturn current policy, or merely serve as an
advisory measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This policy was started in the 1980s when we had a health
emergency in San Francisco, and we still have a health emergency in
San Francisco,'' said Lee Ann Monfredini, president of the city
Health Commission. She noted that the Board of Supervisors declares
AIDS a health emergency every two weeks, a legality required to
distribute clean needles to drug addicts who might otherwise become
infected with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has had 25,976 reported cases of AIDS, resulting
in 17,814 deaths, as of March 31 this year, according to the Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The groups arguing to reopen the bathhouses have asked health
commissioners several times in recent months to consider their
request. Monfredini said a meeting had been set for June 5 with the
HIV Prevention Council to discuss the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that we (the Health Commission) will have a hearing
on this,'' Monfredini said. ``We just don't know yet until we see
the data and hear the prevention council's recommendation.''

   WASHINGTON _ In the TV version of America, Newman of
``Seinfeld'' mostly doesn't deliver the mail. Marge Simpson's
chain-smoking sisters, Selma and Patty Bouvier, are uncaring clerks
at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Springfield. New York Mayor
Randall Winston bungles through every episode of ``Spin City.'' And
a social worker on ``The X-Files'' turns out to be the devil in
disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1990s, public officials have the worst image of any
major occupational group on television, and civil servants aren't
far ahead of them,'' concluded a report released Tuesday by the
Center for Media and Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   After examining network prime-time TV series aired from 1955 to
1998, the nonpartisan research organization found that depictions
of elected officials and government workers have grown increasingly
negative over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   In general, teachers and police officers have generally been
portrayed more favorably.
</P>
<P>
   ``From its earliest days, television has split its vote on
government employees,'' the report said. ``Prime time has usually
given thumbs up to law enforcement officials and public school
teachers, thumbs down to public officials and office seekers, and a
dismissive wave of the hand to civil servants.''
</P>
<P>
   The images have turned darker as public trust in government has
steadily eroded.
</P>
<P>
   Most TV viewers _ 55 percent _ believe that government officials
and public servants are accurately portrayed on prime-time
entertainment programs, according to a poll by Yankelovich
Partners. Among younger viewers between the ages of 18 and 34, the
proportion rises to two out of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, the viewing public is buying into these negative
stereotypes,'' said Patricia McGinnis, president of the Council for
Excellence in Government, a non-profit, non-partisan organization
of private sector leaders who have served in government. The
council, which seeks to improve both the performance and image of
government, sponsored both the TV study and the public opinion
poll.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   To find out how entertainment TV portrays government,
researchers examined 1,234 series episodes and 9,588 characters
appearing on the air from 1955 through 1998. On these shows, 2.664
characters _ 28 percent _ were civilian public sector employees.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Our Miss Brooks'' to ``Welcome Back Kotter'' to the
short-lived ``Dangerous Minds,'' programs have usually portrayed
teachers favorably, the study found. Not so principals. From the
blustery Osgood Conklin of ``Our Miss Brooks'' to the hapless
Seymour Skinner of ``The Simpsons'' to the scheming Principal
Snyder of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' the heads of schools have
been buffoons or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and elected officials have never fared particularly
well in TV imagery, but the portrayals have grown harsher over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   In past decades there have been a few competent and honest
public officials _ Fess Parker as a homespun senator in the TV
version of ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' state legislator James
Slattery in ``Slattery's People'' and the problem-solving butler
who evolved into a problem-solving lieutenant governor in
``Benson.''
</P>
<P>
   But from Boss Hogg on the ``Dukes of Hazzard'' to Senator Strobe
Smithers on ``Hearts Afire'' to Mayor Winston of ``Spin City,''
elected officials have more often been shown as scatterbrained or
greedy, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most government officials are portrayed as
``politicians and bureaucrats who serve their own interests or
special interests rather than the public interest,'' the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990s programming, elected officials committed crimes more
than twice as often as characters in other occupations, the study
found. Seven out of 10 episodes that dealt with government services
gave a negative portrayal of the government performance. Among
episodes that dealt with probity of political or legal
institutions, three out of four portrayed the system as corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime-time entertainment today gives public service little
notice and less respect,'' said Robert Lichter, president of the
Center for Media and Public Affairs. ``The core institutions of
government _ the political system and those who work within it _
are treated badly.''
</P>
<P>
   The negative portrayals could have serious ramifications on who
votes and who will run for public office, McGinnis said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But she conceded that there is no proven ``cause and effect''
between negative TV portrayals and declining public trust in public
officials and workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television takes off on reality,'' said Lichter. ``It takes
out all shades of gray'' and ``magnifies'' actuality.
</P>
<P>
   TV's comedic mail carriers _ ``Seinfeld's'' Newman and Cliff
Craven of ``Cheers'' _ exaggerated and amplified traits that many
viewers already attributed to postal employees, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The negative stereotypes generally have not extended to TV cops,
however. From Sgt. Joe Friday of ``Dragnet'' to Sheriff Andy Taylor
of ``The Andy Griffith Show'' to ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' law
enforcers have been shown to be caring, competent and honest. Andy
Sipowicz of ``NYPD Blue'' is a considerably more flawed cop,
however. And a malevolent government usually provides the villains
as well as the FBI good guys on ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Even law enforcers are more often portrayed negatively in the
'90s than previous decades _ a 2-to-1 ratio of positive portrayals
now, compared to 5 to 1 in the past, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankelovich Partners poll was conducted from March 11-14,
1999. The researchers interviewed 1,002 American television
viewers, aged 18 or older, and the survey had a margin of error of
plus or minus 3 percent.

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For reasons that often have little to do with journalism, it can
be surprisingly difficult to maintain a commitment to honest and
courageous reporting while trying to cover certain wars.
 &HT;    The sacred principle of our business is objectivity, and in the
nine years I've been covering war, I've come to learn exactly what
objectivity means _ whether in wars between nations like the
Persian Gulf War or dirty civil wars like Somalia or the kinds of
genocidal campaigns against civilians that have plagued the end of
our century from Yugoslavia to Rwanda.
 &HT;    The only way I can discuss the difficulties of covering the
crisis in Kosovo is by relating my personal experiences. In my
view, this war is still mainly between Yugoslav forces _ special
police units and paramilitaries _ against a civilian population in
the name of rousting terrorists.
 &HT;    A fundamental problem of covering the war concerns objectivity.
First and most important, I have learned that ``objective'' does
not mean ``neutral.'' The sometimes obsessive desire to find equal
weight between two sides is often simply wrong. There is no moral
equivalence between the aggressor and the victim, a civilian who
has been raped and the thug who did it.
 &HT;    Let's be clear: Objectivity means trying to give all sides a
hearing. It does not, in my view, mean treating all sides as equal.
That, I believe, would be a fundamentally incorrect and immoral
application of objectivity.
 &HT;    This is what the French writer and philosopher Albert Camus
warned: Not choosing is also a choice. I have chosen to apply, to
the best of my ability, contextual objectivity to all my reporting,
especially during war and especially when confronted with the most
serious crimes against humanity as determined by the international
conventions. I insist on putting my reports in context, and I am
often strongly impassioned. I won't apply moral equivalents where
none exist.
 &HT;    At the Kosovo-Albanian border, watching what was happening,
seeing babies and old people and sick people and handicapped people
being forced to march out of their country and listening to their
stories, I reported the tragedy and it was one of the most
difficult things I've had to do in a long time. It was essentially
all of the experience of Bosnia telescoped into a very short period
of time.
 &HT;    We are human beings; I make no excuse for that. Yet our humanity
needs to come across without overwhelming what we do. I have
learned to direct the incredible emotional burden and the physical
and mental pain of what we see into telling the story. Our task is
comparable to that of emergency-room doctors who cannot help but be
affected by what they see yet cannot allow it to overwhelm their
professional obligations.
 &HT;    And that brings us to a second difficulty when covering war,
especially in places such as Serbia which by any definition is a
dictatorship and which has iron-tight state-controlled media that
gives out propaganda and hate and which, importantly, is the only
source of information for most Serbians. This difficulty is
censorship.
 &HT;    I am, without wanting to be self-serving, CNN's longest-serving
Balkan hand. And yet I am no longer in Belgrade because the Serb
authorities hate my reporting.
 &HT;    On March 24, the night the air war started, I was in Belgrade
describing the action from a hotel rooftop when mayhem broke out:
Plainclothes police were carting other journalists off and
deporting many of them. In my case, the notorious paramilitary
known as ``Arkan'' _ his name is really Zeljko Raznjatovic _ had
his thugs looking for me. They burst into a colleague's office, put
everyone against the wall, brandished automatic weapons and began
yelling for me. This is because I had done an investigative report
about Arkan's work _ what he had done during the Bosnian war.
 &HT;    Before the NATO bombing began, Serb television went on a fierce
anti-Western journalist campaign, blaming foreign correspondents
for bringing in NATO, specifically calling CNN ``a factory of
lies.'' It became impossible for me to report, and because of the
direct threats I left Belgrade.
 &HT;    Even after other reporters were returning, a high-level Yugoslav
minister told CNN that I could not go back because they could not
guarantee my security. That is a threat. Then they allowed CNN to
put another, more presumably to-their-liking correspondent in
Belgrade. In my view that is censorship. It is at least control.
 &HT;    And throughout we have endured a form of censorship there, as
have all the other news organizations. Our crews are escorted by
special government or police minders. They are not free to go where
they want, when they want, and they have to rely mostly on Serbian
television pictures. This isn't to say that CNN or others shouldn't
be there, but simply that our viewers should know all the
restrictions we operate under.
 &HT;    The ultimate form of censorship, of course, is expelling all
journalists from Kosovo and keeping them under tight control in
Belgrade. For myself, I ended up on the border where we had much
better access to information. The testimony of those people being
deported en masse, their shocking and consistent accounts, built a
chilling and brutal picture of ethnic cleansing and executions,
separation of men and women, rape _ and all of this against
civilians.
 &HT;    In my years of covering Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo, the most
terrible things were often first reported by journalists from
eyewitness accounts. And then they were proven true: the death
camps in Bosnia, the mass graves, for instance.
 &HT;    Of course, none of the Albanian refugees on Serbian television
are portrayed as fleeing the terror campaign; Serb officials insist
they are only fleeing NATO bombing. And most Serbs believe that.
They don't have a choice. There is no alternative to them other
than state-controlled media.
 &HT;    Some ask, but doesn't NATO also restrict its information _
impose censorship? The answer is, of course, yes. We don't get the
full story in real time from NATO. But again, in my view, there is
no moral nor practical equivalent between a dictatorship carrying
out what many are now calling crimes against humanity and a
military organization of the free democratic world which is subject
to scrutiny of a free and vigorous press.
 &HT;    And lest anyone doubt Belgrade, one of the few prominent
independent Serbian journalists was recently shot dead near his
home. This has a chilling effect.
 &HT;    Consider the way some Western news organizations covered Arkan,
whose secret indictment by the war-crimes tribunal at The Hague was
made public on March 31. He was either sought out or offered
himself up for interviews; he is a legitimate news story. But if
one is going to give a man like that air time, in my view, one is
obliged to challenge him.
 &HT;    This is one of the most brutal psychopathic killers to patrol
the Balkans. Yet several global news organizations allowed him to
simply air his views. He was allowed to accuse me of getting him
indicted, and CNN of lying about the plight of Kosovar Albanians.
It was predictable, yes. But unchallenged, surely we cannot accept
that.
 &HT;    The burden surely is on the reporters to face him with knowledge
and information, to have the courage and willingness to do it
right. Anyone indicted for the most grave of crimes against
humanity is not a chat-show guest. Just imagine giving Hitler's
henchmen a platform to simply air their views. We cannot go for the
easy way. It is worth getting in a few pointed questions, even if
it means getting thrown out. Otherwise, don't do the interview, it
isn't worth it.
 &HT;    I raise this because it in turn leads to another awkward
question: What price access? Indeed these are the important and
uncomfortable questions, the difficulties of war coverage. They are
magnified a million times when you deal with a regime based on
terror _ and one that targets journalists too. How to maintain your
objectivity without forcing equality on an unequal situation. How
to get around censorship. And how to keep your honor and
credibility as well as your access.

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For reasons that often have little to do with journalism, it can
be surprisingly difficult to maintain a commitment to honest and
courageous reporting while trying to cover certain wars.
 &HT;    The sacred principle of our business is objectivity, and in the
nine years I've been covering war, I've come to learn exactly what
objectivity means _ whether in wars between nations like the
Persian Gulf War or dirty civil wars like Somalia or the kinds of
genocidal campaigns against civilians that have plagued the end of
our century from Yugoslavia to Rwanda.
 &HT;    The only way I can discuss the difficulties of covering the
crisis in Kosovo is by relating my personal experiences. In my
view, this war is still mainly between Yugoslav forces _ special
police units and paramilitaries _ against a civilian population in
the name of rousting terrorists.
 &HT;    A fundamental problem of covering the war concerns objectivity.
First and most important, I have learned that ``objective'' does
not mean ``neutral.'' The sometimes obsessive desire to find equal
weight between two sides is often simply wrong. There is no moral
equivalence between the aggressor and the victim, a civilian who
has been raped and the thug who did it.
 &HT;    Let's be clear: Objectivity means trying to give all sides a
hearing. It does not, in my view, mean treating all sides as equal.
That, I believe, would be a fundamentally incorrect and immoral
application of objectivity.
 &HT;    This is what the French writer and philosopher Albert Camus
warned: Not choosing is also a choice. I have chosen to apply, to
the best of my ability, contextual objectivity to all my reporting,
especially during war and especially when confronted with the most
serious crimes against humanity as determined by the international
conventions. I insist on putting my reports in context, and I am
often strongly impassioned. I won't apply moral equivalents where
none exist.
 &HT;    At the Kosovo-Albanian border, watching what was happening,
seeing babies and old people and sick people and handicapped people
being forced to march out of their country and listening to their
stories, I reported the tragedy and it was one of the most
difficult things I've had to do in a long time. It was essentially
all of the experience of Bosnia telescoped into a very short period
of time.
 &HT;    We are human beings; I make no excuse for that. Yet our humanity
needs to come across without overwhelming what we do. I have
learned to direct the incredible emotional burden and the physical
and mental pain of what we see into telling the story. Our task is
comparable to that of emergency-room doctors who cannot help but be
affected by what they see yet cannot allow it to overwhelm their
professional obligations.
 &HT;    And that brings us to a second difficulty when covering war,
especially in places such as Serbia which by any definition is a
dictatorship and which has iron-tight state-controlled media that
gives out propaganda and hate and which, importantly, is the only
source of information for most Serbians. This difficulty is
censorship.
 &HT;    I am, without wanting to be self-serving, CNN's longest-serving
Balkan hand. And yet I am no longer in Belgrade because the Serb
authorities hate my reporting.
 &HT;    On March 24, the night the air war started, I was in Belgrade
describing the action from a hotel rooftop when mayhem broke out:
Plainclothes police were carting other journalists off and
deporting many of them. In my case, the notorious paramilitary
known as ``Arkan'' _ his name is really Zeljko Raznjatovic _ had
his thugs looking for me. They burst into a colleague's office, put
everyone against the wall, brandished automatic weapons and began
yelling for me. This is because I had done an investigative report
about Arkan's work _ what he had done during the Bosnian war.
 &HT;    Before the NATO bombing began, Serb television went on a fierce
anti-Western journalist campaign, blaming foreign correspondents
for bringing in NATO, specifically calling CNN ``a factory of
lies.'' It became impossible for me to report, and because of the
direct threats I left Belgrade.
 &HT;    Even after other reporters were returning, a high-level Yugoslav
minister told CNN that I could not go back because they could not
guarantee my security. That is a threat. Then they allowed CNN to
put another, more presumably to-their-liking correspondent in
Belgrade. In my view that is censorship. It is at least control.
 &HT;    And throughout we have endured a form of censorship there, as
have all the other news organizations. Our crews are escorted by
special government or police minders. They are not free to go where
they want, when they want, and they have to rely mostly on Serbian
television pictures. This isn't to say that CNN or others shouldn't
be there, but simply that our viewers should know all the
restrictions we operate under.
 &HT;    The ultimate form of censorship, of course, is expelling all
journalists from Kosovo and keeping them under tight control in
Belgrade. For myself, I ended up on the border where we had much
better access to information. The testimony of those people being
deported en masse, their shocking and consistent accounts, built a
chilling and brutal picture of ethnic cleansing and executions,
separation of men and women, rape _ and all of this against
civilians.
 &HT;    In my years of covering Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo, the most
terrible things were often first reported by journalists from
eyewitness accounts. And then they were proven true: the death
camps in Bosnia, the mass graves, for instance.
 &HT;    Of course, none of the Albanian refugees on Serbian television
are portrayed as fleeing the terror campaign; Serb officials insist
they are only fleeing NATO bombing. And most Serbs believe that.
They don't have a choice. There is no alternative to them other
than state-controlled media.
 &HT;    Some ask, but doesn't NATO also restrict its information _
impose censorship? The answer is, of course, yes. We don't get the
full story in real time from NATO. But again, in my view, there is
no moral nor practical equivalent between a dictatorship carrying
out what many are now calling crimes against humanity and a
military organization of the free democratic world which is subject
to scrutiny of a free and vigorous press.
 &HT;    And lest anyone doubt Belgrade, one of the few prominent
independent Serbian journalists was recently shot dead near his
home. This has a chilling effect.
 &HT;    Consider the way some Western news organizations covered Arkan,
whose secret indictment by the war-crimes tribunal at The Hague was
made public on March 31. He was either sought out or offered
himself up for interviews; he is a legitimate news story. But if
one is going to give a man like that air time, in my view, one is
obliged to challenge him.
 &HT;    This is one of the most brutal psychopathic killers to patrol
the Balkans. Yet several global news organizations allowed him to
simply air his views. He was allowed to accuse me of getting him
indicted, and CNN of lying about the plight of Kosovar Albanians.
It was predictable, yes. But unchallenged, surely we cannot accept
that.
 &HT;    The burden surely is on the reporters to face him with knowledge
and information, to have the courage and willingness to do it
right. Anyone indicted for the most grave of crimes against
humanity is not a chat-show guest. Just imagine giving Hitler's
henchmen a platform to simply air their views. We cannot go for the
easy way. It is worth getting in a few pointed questions, even if
it means getting thrown out. Otherwise, don't do the interview, it
isn't worth it.
 &HT;    I raise this because it in turn leads to another awkward
question: What price access? Indeed these are the important and
uncomfortable questions, the difficulties of war coverage. They are
magnified a million times when you deal with a regime based on
terror _ and one that targets journalists too. How to maintain your
objectivity without forcing equality on an unequal situation. How
to get around censorship. And how to keep your honor and
credibility as well as your access.

GOVERNOR SHAHEEN'S SAVVY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- It's time for the rest of the country to take a
peek at New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the presidential primary nine months away; that stuff
has yet to acquire the relevance even of spring training. The
reason New Hampshire beckons is for the lesson in consensus
politics it can teach right now, all the more important because the
issue involved is education. Moreover, the lesson will tell serious
politics watchers a great deal about the atmosphere in which the
presidential season will ultimately unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Not many weeks ago, local analysts were doing tap dances on
Governor Jeanne Shaheen's head, celebrating the presumed demise of
her efforts to reform the state's method of paying for the public
schools under Supreme Court order.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly from within her Democratic Party, both locally and
nationally, many were also gloating at the presumed political
demise of Shaheen because she failed to see their wisdom in arguing
that New Hampshire's school crisis was the perfect opportunity to
impose an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many saw the same old shouting match between left and
right as a conversation that ordinary citizens were having, which
was presumed to have framed the debate and the choices for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this noise and inaccurate analysis and prediction, one
of the country's best governors quietly, and at critical times,
stubbornly, plugged for a consensus solution to one of the toughest
dilemmas a state can face. And now, give or take a few final
details, she has prevailed in a fashion _ conceptually and
legislatively _ that only enhances her special reputation.
</P>
<P>
   For those who insist on strictly political metaphors, here's
one: The leadership Governor Shaheen has shown and the huge results
her gentle relentlessness has produced constitute exactly what
Texas Governor George Bush was unable to pull off when faced with a
similar challenge. For those local and national geniuses who crowed
that Jeanne Shaheen, after this mess, would never be considered for
national office by Al Gore or Bill Bradley, let's drag out those
two words one last time _ wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   In the almost two years that have passed since the New Hampshire
Supreme Court decided an open-and-shut case and ruled that local
property taxes alone are an unconstitutional method of paying for
public schools because they are unevenly levied among wealthy and
not-so-wealthy communities, both the left and right have screamed
more than they have thought. New Hampshire is a place justly
infamous for its polarizing politics.
</P>
<P>
   The right pushed for amending the New Hampshire Constitution to
undo the ruling, in effect ending the state's responsibility for
educating kids. The left tried to seize the opportunity to impose,
at long last, an income tax, even though Shaheen had pledged not to
allow one.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially alone, Shaheen argued that the inequity found by the
court could be fixed through consensus rather than revolution, and
the state gradually realized that here was a veteran pol who
actually meant what she said and said what she believed.
</P>
<P>
   And what Shaheen believed was that the court requirement that a
fair method of financing the cost of an adequate education could be
devised without a tax revolution.
</P>
<P>
   She was right. The core of an effort to come up with $825
million ($4,220 per pupil) to make the system whole is a statewide
property tax that will actually reduce levies for people and
business in 80 percent of the state's localities, contains some
compensating business taxes, raises cigarette taxes by 25 cents,
and uses a chunk of New Hampshire's share from the settlement of
national tobacco lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   That and a few other items still leaves the Legislature's
package $40-plus million short, and further litigation could mess
the case up again. But the journey Shaheen started is almost ended
_ and on the same, fair terms with which she began it.
</P>
<P>
   The shame for the state is that she had to do it alone, in the
face of hate, ridicule, and condescension. As usual, the people out
of touch were the ideological elites, not ordinary folks and their
tough governor.

THE FORCE.NET BE WITH YOU: HOUSTON WEB SITE LEADS A GALAXY OF
INFORMATION FOR `STAR WARS' FANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Also see: Star-Wars-List) 
 
By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When ``Star Wars'' blasted off in 1977, the biggest
forum where fans could mingle was in lines outside theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Now that seems like a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
Today's devotees of R2-D2 and the Force are closely entwined on the
Internet, which has propelled them from the dark ages of gleaning
tidbits in magazines to the cyberspace era of having all things
``Star Wars'' instantly at their fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Star Wars: Episode One _ The Phantom Menace'' nears its May
19 release, this cyber fan base isn't just connected. It seems
almost omniscient.
</P>
<P>
   Just how know-it-all is this new breed of fan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've got a copy of the script,'' said Scott Chitwood of
Houston, a founder of www.theforce.net, widely recognized as the
top ``Star Wars'' fan Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, through one of its many ``spies,'' theforce.net got
a copy of director George Lucas' screenplay for ``TPM,'' the first
film in his ``Star Wars'' prequel trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they it was posted it online. That would have been
going too far, Chitwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when theforce.net does leak information about the film, it
labels some items as ``spoilers.'' Those who want to wait and to
savor the movie's full impact can avoid such things while trolling
the site's many features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see both sides of it,'' Chitwood said. ``There are people
who really hate it _ who think we're ruining their Christmas
presents. But I think even Lucas feels it's kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some fan-run Web sites push the limits, posting shaky rumors
or facts that should stay secret awhile longer, such as which
characters in the new movie live or die.
</P>
<P>
   Even theforce.net got into hot water with Lucas when it carried
a sound clip of new comic sidekick Jar Jar Binks' voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Lucasfilm) called us personally and said, `OK, you've
had your fun. We love the fan sites, but this is going too far,'''
Chitwood said. ``And I agreed with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think hearing two lines of dialogue took away from the
film, but they've let us get away with so much that you've got to
respect their wishes. You can't just say, `Sue me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the plot ``is pretty much all out there,'' said Chitwood,
27, a civil engineer who designs offshore structures for Shell
Deepwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other Web sites have posted the ending of the movie. We've got
that information, too, but there's no way we're going to run with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this would have been possible without the Internet's
elaborate networks of communication between fans and filmmakers
near and far. ``Star Wars'' is big-time on the Net, amassing about
7,000 sites in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, theforce.net is like a daily newspaper. Its home
page is subtitled ``Your daily dose of Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   News is posted daily _ often several times a day _ by Chitwood
and about a dozen colleagues, including co-founder Darin Smith of
Dallas, a friend from their days at Texas A&AMP;M University in College
Station.
</P>
<P>
   That's where theforce.net had its genesis in 1996, just as
``Star Wars'' mania began rising again, but before ``Star Wars''
was an Internet staple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some sites, but we didn't see any doing what we
wanted: showing news and reviews,'' Chitwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Limited to campus, ``The Star Wars Page at Texas A&AMP;M'' drew mild
interest. It got a few ``hits'' (or Web visits) by Aggie Net
surfers, but when its creators finished graduate studies, they were
unable to pass it on. ``We'd hoped to hand it off to other Aggies,
but nobody else was interested,'' Chitwood said.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1997 _ with Chitwood employed in Houston and Smith in
Dallas _ they launched theforce.net on the Internet, bringing
aboard other far-flung fans they'd met online (including some they
still haven't met in person).
</P>
<P>
   Chitwood is editor ``by default,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different people do the job as time permits. But what I say
goes, so I take the heat, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Other staffers for the nonprofit site live across the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 26, an aerospace engineer, isn't as active now as before.
``Real life is taking over,'' he said. ``It's fun, but you can't
stay a little boy forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Working in its spare time, theforce.net crew has carved out such
high visibility that Lucasfilm monitors the site. It's also
contributed to stories in Newsweek, Entertainment Weekly and the
Houston Chronicle, as well as being featured on E! and other
television channels.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly operating costs of $2,000 (the site has a commercial
bandwidth) are covered by tiny sponsor ads, with excess funds going
to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the site has attracted 25,000 to 30,000 visitors per day.
When the second ``TPM'' trailer hit theaters and theforce.net had
it online, the site drew 40,000 visitors per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, we were lucky to get 5,000 a day, and when we
first started, 100 a day,'' Chitwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a high profile was first sparked by ``Troops,'' a parody by
Kevin Rubio, who set ``Star Wars''' Stormtroopers amid the motifs
of TV's ``Cops.'' Visitors flocked when theforce.net hosted his
video (which it still does).
</P>
<P>
   Then the first trilogy's ``Special Editions'' reached theaters
in '97, ``and that fed this to a large degree,'' Chitwood said. ``A
lot of kids were seeing the films for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by prequel news, which began as a trickle but
has become a flood, eclipsing standing site features such as
discussion forums, editorials, humor and fan fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we update the news every day, we have a loyal fan
base,'' Chitwood said. ``We've become part of people's routine.''
</P>
<P>
   High visibility has made theforce.net a logical place for those
with juicy tidbits to spill the beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look for this,'' Chitwood said. ``If somebody has
something they want to spread around, they come to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy sneaked onto the set (of ''TPM``) and took some
pictures. But we keep our sources anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites are more like fan clubs _ including www.swgeeks.com,
Web home of the Greater Gulf Coast Star Wars Collectors.
</P>
<P>
   It's designed to unite club members _ roughly three dozen
people, mostly males _ in their pursuit of ``Star Wars'' toys, a
multibillion-dollar industry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They launched the club in 1997 to help members find toys at
retail and avoid paying inflated prices to collectibles dealers
down the line. Monday was D-Day, when the new film's toys arrived
in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal was to get different sets of eyes out there
looking for our collections,'' said founder Blake Wright of
Houston. ``No member should have to buy a new `Star Wars' toy off
the secondary market from a dealer who gouges. We look out for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides staying in touch online, the fans also meet monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as crazy as people might think,'' said Wright, a
reporter for an international oil and gas newspaper. ``We're
normal. We have jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many fans that it's a broad spectrum,'' Chitwood
said. ``But most are average people. There are a lot worse
hobbies.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, 30, bought original `Star Wars' toys years ago, but they
were destroyed in a fire in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drifted away after `Return of the Jedi' left theaters,
around 1984,'' he said. ``Then there was hardly anything new about
`Star Wars' until the summer of '95.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when a new wave of toys swept the market, with Hasbro
(the big toy licensee for `TPM') reissuing old `Star Wars' toys and
figures in updated forms.
</P>
<P>
   Wright started collecting again _ to look, not touch. He keeps
about 80 percent of his items sealed in their display boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Like Chitwood, he's got a room at home filled with ``Star Wars''
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mythology,'' Wright said. ``America doesn't really have
its own mythology, but `Star Wars' gives us that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing really special about the story. It's good vs.
evil. But everybody can relate to it. And in 1977, no one had ever
seen anything like it _ had ever seen a `droid' or these other
worlds that Lucas created.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Davidson of Prince George, British Columbia, chief graphic
designer for theforce.net, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars is a fascinating universe from a sci-fi and fantasy
standpoint,'' he said. ``It's a timeless tale of good vs. evil _ of
the fall and retribution of Darth Vader.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, 21, wasn't born when ``Star Wars'' arrived in '77, but
still says he was there at the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in my mother's womb when she first saw Star Wars,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stream of news keeps him extremely busy. ``I could spend
more time on it but have to allocate,'' he said. ``Some people
might say we're too obsessive, but I have another life. There's
school, friends, hobbies, traveling, working out. And there's Star
Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Chitwood acknowledges the hype, but doesn't think the movie is
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather see Star Wars on the cover of every magazine than
kids getting blown away in Colorado or other harsh realities. This
is a good escape while teaching kids good lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith calls Star Wars ``good clean fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like Yoda _ the philosophy and wisdom he pours out. A
lot of fans blitz over that, but there's a lot of meat there. I
like the morals Lucas tries to pass on.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also favors Han Solo as ``a space cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright won't say who his favorite Star Wars character is.
Chitwood favors Darth Vader, while Davidson prefers Chewbacca.
</P>
<P>
   Other fans are excited about Darth Maul, a new red-faced
villain. ``We've probably seen 10 seconds of him in a trailer, but
he's already been embraced as one evil dude,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Vader, ``He's a good guy who's just misunderstood,''
Chitwood said.
</P>
<P>
   How did Chitwood's fascination start?
</P>
<P>
   He first saw ``Star Wars'' at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a loose tooth, and my dad said, `Let me wiggle that
tooth, and I'll take you to see Star Wars.' I said `No way,' but he
grabbed me and pulled the tooth right out and said, `Great. We're
going to see Star Wars.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried all the way to the theater _ and now this,'' Chitwood
said. ``Who would have thought?''
</P>
<P>
   Now he and many fans are scheduling vacation time so they can
see the new film the day it opens _ not that the plot will have
many surprises for him.
</P>
<P>
   Chitwood says he probably wouldn't have dug so deeply if he'd
known he'd uncover so much. ``But once you start digging into this
stuff, it's kind of addicting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we had a full description of the first trailer before
it came out, but when you go into the theater and see it with a
crowd and hear that music, you totally forget everything you knew
before and are just blown away. And I expect that to happen
again.''

FIGHTING A PARASITE IN WINE COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992, the scene across the Napa Valley was desolate. In what
had been some of the most beautiful vineyards in the world, piles
of dead vines pulled from the soil were being burned. The pall of
black smoke mirrored the mood of winemakers, who watched grimly as
their lives' work went up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Phylloxera, the dreaded parasite that had devastated the vines
of Europe and California a century before, had returned, and
despite a hundred years of research, it seemed there was little
anyone could do to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   In Napa County and the other wine regions of northern
California, the insect destroyed some 50,000 acres, about half of
the total vines.
</P>
<P>
   The phylloxera epidemic has run its course. The insect surfaces
occasionally, and old vines must still be burned, but fresh
plantings are everywhere. What's more, the new grapes are better
than ever, and most California winemakers are convinced that the
wines will be, too.
</P>
<P>
   As the first chardonnays and sauvignon blancs made from these
new vines are released in the next year or so, will wine drinkers
be able to taste the difference? Probably not. Most wines are
blends of different vintages, and it would take a very discerning
tongue to tell which of the new ones contain a bit of the
pre-phylloxera grapes.
</P>
<P>
   But for winemakers, good has come from bad: the disaster opened
the door to new and better ways to make wine. ``We were forced to
rethink everything,'' said Tom Selfridge, the president and chief
executive of the Chalone Group of wineries. ``If there had been no
phylloxera, we would have replanted gradually and made changes as
we went along. But this was war; we were forced to make a lot of
major decisions quickly, and we knew we had better make the right
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Grape vines normally are replaced every 30 to 35 years, as they
become less resistant to disease. Most Napa Valley and Sonoma
County vines were planted in the 1970s and were not due for
replacement until 2000 or 2010. But because of the inexperience of
some of the winemakers and some misadvice over the years, many of
the 1970s plantings turned out to have been the wrong vines in the
wrong places.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, phylloxera in California ``presented an
otherwise unavailable opportunity to redress the legacy of the
1970s,'' said the Australian winemaker James Halliday.
</P>
<P>
   Phylloxera is a microscopic insect native to the eastern United
States, but indigenous American vines are resistant to it. It was
accidentally introduced into Europe around 1860 on vine cuttings
from the United States, and within two decades it had destroyed
virtually all of the vineyards of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It reached California, where European vines had been planted, in
the 1880s and by 1892 had destroyed 15,000 acres in the Napa Valley
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The only effective way to fight the bug is to graft European
vines, from which the best wines are made, onto native American
roots. In the 1960s, before phylloxera was a problem here,
agricultural experts at the University of California recommended a
rootstock called AxR1, which was thought to be phylloxera resistant
and produced plenty of grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Most California growers, who had been using a less productive
native American rootstock called St. George, quickly switched to
AxR1. Most of the new wineries that opened in California in the
1970s used it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Within years, however, Napa Valley vines on AxR1 roots had begun
to sicken. In 1983, it was discovered that phylloxera was the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, the Northern California wine industry
would spend more than a half billion dollars replanting vineyards.
The Robert Mondavi Winery, which began its own experiments with
various new rootstocks in 1983, estimates that it has spent $50
million in redeveloping its phylloxera-stricken vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every case, however, the wineries ultimately benefited
from the disaster by rectifying errors they had made and by taking
advantage of the latest research on new grape clones, planting
density and the compatibility between rootstocks and the vines
grafted to them.
</P>
<P>
   They learned about new kinds of vine trellises and how to orient
the vines to get the best combinations of sun and irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   With the new plantings there are now hundreds, sometimes
thousands of additional vines per acre compared to what was there
20 years ago. The idea is to make the plants compete for nutrients,
water and sun, creating grapes with greater intensity and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have warned of potential problems stemming from
doing too much too fast; indeed, some of the new rootstocks have
shown signs of previously undetected viruses. But most growers and
winemakers who could afford the changeover are happy with the
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot we don't know,'' said Daniel Roberts, a
soil expert with Kendall-Jackson Vineyards, ``but we are going to
be able to produce high-end, reserve-quality wines in three years,
where it once took 20 years'' for vines to fully mature.
</P>
<P>
   Under Roberts' tutelage, Kendall-Jackson is replanting in
smaller blocks so that the development of different techniques can
be studied over the years. But what of the post-phylloxera wines?
Are they better or just different?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are better,'' said Warren Winiarski, the owner of Stag's
Leap Wine Cellars. ``They are more concentrated; they have a more
mature taste when they are still young.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mondavi is one of the few wineries that has released a
wine made entirely from post-phylloxera grapes _ a 1997 cabernet
sauvignon. Most winemakers, including Winiarski, are making wines
using post-phylloxera grapes along with grapes from vineyards that
were never affected by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   I have had the opportunity to try two Beringer Vineyards'
Knights Valley cabernets made in part from post-phylloxera vines, a
1994 and a 1995. Both were first-rate, but the 1995, which had more
of the new grapes, was stylistically different from the 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It showed what the Beringer winemaker, Ed Sbragia, called a
sparkle or brightness that the earlier wines did not. I preferred
the 1994, but I suspect that the new grapes had very little to do
with making it outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   What vineyard managers and winemakers hope to obtain from the
new vineyards is intensity and consistency. If they achieve it,
perhaps it will push American winemaking to a new level _ and also
help drive away the bad memories of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even in periods of great change, some people remain
happily uninvolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my vineyards were in St. George when the big move to AxR1
was made,'' said Rodney Strong, the founder of Rodney Strong
Vineyards in Sonoma County. ``I was too poor to switch over. I was
disappointed then. I'm not now.''

   ``You told me once, dear, you really loved me/And no one else
could come between/But now you've left me and love another/You have
shattered all my dreams.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walter Weiss remembers the good old days, which in
restaurants now means B.C. _ Before Cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, the maitre d'hotel at the ``21'' Club, has been in its
employ since 1946 and lived through the era of ``The Sweet Smell of
Success,'' which eternalized Burt Lancaster as a gossip columnist
working the phones brought to his table at ``21.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant will still bring a phone to the table, should a
customer need one, Weiss said last week. Because in a sweet twist
of fate, cell phones don't work at ``21.'' ``There are too many
steel beams,'' he said. ``You get no reception at all. Some of them
work in our lounge, but most people have to go on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should stay there. Cell phone abuse is sweeping
dining rooms throughout New York, from the priciest, like ``21,''
to the more humble, like the Old Town Bar, at 45 East 18th Street.
Prominently displayed there is a picture of a cell phone surrounded
by a red circle with a line through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cellular-free zone _ people have to go outside,'' said
Gerard Meagher, the manager. ``We were built in 1892, and we try to
maintain the spirit of a tavern, a place of good feeling and
fellowship. Talking on a cell phone is self-indulgent.''
</P>
<P>
   And Danny Meyer, the owner of Union Square Cafe, Gramercy
Tavern, Eleven Madison Park and Tabla, has also decided cell phones
make him mad as hell and he won't take it anymore. Last week new
signs were posted at all four front desks, reading: ``Out of
respect to our guests, we ask you to please refrain from using your
cell phone in the dining room.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer is so exercised, in fact, that he included a special
message in the Union Square Cafe spring newsletter that began by
saying, ``If clouds of cigarette smoke and pungent fragrances like
Giorgio and Poison were the dining room scourges of the 80s, then
the rampant, inconsiderate use of cell phones in restaurants has
become their baneful heir as we approach the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Them's fighting words from Meyer, a mild-mannered St. Louis
native whose emphasis on hospitality keeps his restaurants at the
top of the Zagat Survey's popularity polls.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent phone interview (from his office, not a cell phone),
he said: ``The thing about cell phones is that they've taken the
city by storm before anyone had a chance to be brought up the right
way about them by their parents. Their use lacks etiquette, form
and propriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Tabla one night, we had three people at the same table on
separate phones at the same time. I understand that restaurants are
also places to do business, but what is particularly annoying is
two things: One is that the people doing it are creating a scene
around themselves, needing to show how important they are. Two is
that restaurants are also places people go to enjoy being restored.
It's hard to be restored while someone is doing something that's
all about being elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the rudeness of inflicting a private conversation on
others, whether of the ``buy/sell'' or ``Mommy will be home soon''
variety, is hardly confined to the dining room. Complaints abound
from all kinds of public spaces, especially theaters and trains,
where callers have all-too-captive audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't cell phone offenders recognize themselves, their
victims ask. They seem to have bountiful excuses, usually
business-related. But no matter what they claim, cell phone victims
say all roads lead to one indisputable element: ME. Look at ME.
Listen to ME. Stop everything you are doing at your own table, and
pay attention to ME.
</P>
<P>
   The offenders seem blind to the sorry reality that these
high-volume, one-sided, arrhythmic monologues are becoming the
technological equivalent of halitosis. Some diners see a cell phone
at the next table and flag the maitre d': it is most definitely
time to move.
</P>
<P>
   While Meyer is at the forefront of the anti-cell-phone movement
in New York, he has been beaten by Gordon Ramsay, the acclaimed
British chef who owns the restaurant bearing his name in London.
``We have printed on the menu, `Please refrain from using mobile
telephones in the dining room,' and it works,'' Ramsay said.
``There are 42 seats in my dining room, and in terms of invading
our privacy and intimacy, it is the height of bad manners. We have
them leave the telephones at the front desk, and if it's necessary,
we will answer them, take the call and let them know. What did
these people do 10 years ago? As a chef, I work 16-hour days, and
nothing infuriates me more than delivering an appetizer to the
table and seeing someone on the phone.''

   But for those who insist that work is all, Judith Re still says
that's not good enough. The founder of the Judith Re Academie in
Fairfield, Conn., she is an expert on etiquette who advises
corporate executives, most of whom are so concerned about
identifying a fish fork that they are oblivious to the disgust of
their fellow diners or, more crucially, Ms. Re says, their business
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you break bread with a client, you create a boardroom
feeling,'' she said, ``but by introducing a cell phone, it
minimizes your lunch. You've turned the boardroom back into an
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also tell executives that if a client stays on the phone
more than three minutes, you've lost them. They are not interested
in what you are saying. If this happens, discontinue eating and try
to end the lunch earlier than you had expected. I really don't know
why people feel an important need to be reached during a meal. If
you were in your own office having an important conversation, you
wouldn't take calls. Why is it different if you go to a
restaurant?''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant based in Manhattan agrees.
``I would much rather be in a room full of smokers than cell
jockeys,'' he said. ``If people have to use cell phones in a
restaurant, they should buy the kind that vibrate, so only they
enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is outraged by cell phone use, however. Gary
Greengrass, the owner of Barney Greengrass, takes it in stride.
``When a phone rings, you see 50 guys move toward their pockets,''
he said, amused. ``It doesn't bother me at all.'' He does concede,
however, that ``in a fine dining environment, it would be a little
more annoying.''
</P>
<P>
   And Julian Niccolini, an owner of the Four Seasons, claims to
have no problem with cell phone use. ``Most of our customers seem
to be very knowledgeable about the fact that it is bad manners to
use them at the table, especially to receive calls there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Niccolini's patrons notwithstanding, others in the restaurant
business are taking a practical approach. Steve Monkewicz, the
marketing director for the Santo Family Group, which is to open the
new Domus by the Sign of the Dove in April 2000, said the owners
are ``giving strong consideration to not allowing cell phones
during dining hours.''
</P>
<P>
   While Meyer may eventually do the same, he is giving his
customers a chance to do the right thing on their own. ``We ask
them to take their cell near the pay phone area or to go outside,''
he said. ``At Eleven Madison Park, a week or so ago, we had a scene
right out of a Steve Martin movie. A cell phone rang, and 50 heads
turned in unison and scowled at the table. I think a lot of people
are completely unaware of how they sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have two rules in my restaurants. I tolerate nothing
that is offensive to the staff and nothing that is offensive to the
guests. We're in business for everybody, not just the one guy on
his phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Zagat, a publisher of the Zagat Surveys, said most people
surveyed do not approve of cell phones in the dining room: ``I
personally find them offensive in fine dining, at some place like
Lespinasse. But some place like Maloney &AMP; Porcelli, it almost comes
with the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   A manager at Maloney &AMP; Porcelli, a raucous steakhouse known for
its oversize portions of meat, oversize space and oversize ratio of
male diners, would not identify herself when speaking about the
cell phone issue, though she did introduce another consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large majority of our customers do have them,'' she said.
``But when most people want to use their phones here, they can't.
It's so loud they have to go outside to hear.''

SERVING BRAINS, COURAGE _ AND SMILES

<TEXT>
<P>
   I had completed a delightful repast at the British pub-styled
Moon Under Water restaurant in St. Petersburg, Fla., and was
scanning the bill:
</P>
<P>
   One crab cake appetizer, $4.95. Correct. One sauteed shrimp
entree, $7.95. Right again. And both scrumptious.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a double-take.
</P>
<P>
   Brains, $3.97. Courage, $3.97.
</P>
<P>
   What, no $3.97 heart for the Tin Man, Toto?
</P>
<P>
   I kept staring at the slip of paper. Was someone playing a joke?
Finally, I realized that my companion had ordered a pint of John
Courage beer while I chose a Brains Traditional Welsh Ale.
</P>
<P>
   Brains and Courage. Valued equally. Can you imagine trying to
justify those purchases on an expense report?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WISE INVESTMENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If only I could get in contact with French chef Marc Meneau who,
upon learning last month that Michelin had demoted his Burgundy
restaurant L'Esperance from three to two stars, sighed, ``That's
it, I am no longer one of France's top 20 chefs. You ask yourself,
`Why me and not another?' There is no answer, so I will try to
rebuild my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding no doubt would be so much easier if Meneau knew to
invest in a few of those $3.97 pints of courage.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, life on the road does bring surprises. And laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone headed to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia? I receive
word of hundreds of hotel promotions every month _ the vast
majority not worth passing along _ but the Jalousie Hilton's newest
service is a first:
</P>
<P>
   ``Guests can now make appointments to see St. Lucia's Bush
Doctor, local resident Daniel Cherubin aka `Menziel,' who dispenses
hands-on healing and natural herbal medicine from his garden and/or
from the island's natural rain forest,'' the promotion advises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicinal remedies which Daniel concocts include boiling
japanah with pea leaves to cure the common cold; making a tea of
tichimai and salt to lessen the severity of headaches; boiling
glory cedar with Epsom salts to induce a relaxed state; boiling
dried sour sop leaves with water to alleviate sleeplessness; and
combining braden and logwood leaves to encourage bloodclotting.''
</P>
<P>
   Call 800-445-8667 to make an appointment ... er, reservation,
and to inquire whether the wizardly bush doctor conjures up doses
of courage for less than $3.97.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SOMETHING TO BARK ABOUT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Alexis Hotel in Seattle got my attention, too, by recently
introducing a new ``Doggie Room-Service'' menu for
``health-conscious dogs traveling with their owners.'' (Presumably,
pooches traveling alone don't qualify.)
</P>
<P>
   In celebration of National Pet Week, which continues through
Saturday, May 8, the Alexis' permanent menu features low-fat items
such as Poochie Pretzels covered with sesame seeds and soy Spud
Puppies stuffed with brown rice. The hotel already was offering a
$25 ``deluxe doggie upgrade,'' whose amenities include a morning
and afternoon walk by a member of the bell staff and a designer
doggie bed placed in the guest's room.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more: For an additional fee, guests can make
appointments with _ no, not the bush doctor _ a pet psychologist
for individual analysis. Call 800-426-7033 for details or
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Pets also were the focus of one welcomed exception to the
routine humdrum millennium ``party-of-the-century'' announcements I
receive each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pets whose owners leave them out of grand tour plans for the
millennium can party with their own kind at special resorts across
the country,'' reports the Associated Press, which continues,
``Best Friends Pets Resorts are planning a New Year's Eve howl with
party treats, catnip and gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   The party will cost $25 for dogs or cats boarded for less than a
week and is free for those staying a week or longer; for
information on locations of 30 facilities in 17 states, call
888-367-7387.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly for human eyes is a new paperback book, ``No Sleeping
On Pavement: Silly Signs and Offbeat Stuff from America's Two-Lane
Roads,'' authored by Loren Eyrich and available for $13.95 from
publisher Two-Lane Roads by calling 888-896-5263 or accessing
www.two-lane.com on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I'll leave you with a few signs identified in the book:

A LYRICAL REVERIE ON A WAY OF LIFE LONG GONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent PBS re-airing of the late Laurie Lee's ``Cider With
Rosie'' on ``Masterpiece Theatre'' has given me a thirst for
reading more of this once-to-a-world writer's work. Most of all, I
wish to read ``Cider With Rosie.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it isn't easy to find in the American marketplace books
by Britons who are not household names here, I had to go to England
_ Wales, rather, in one of the myriad bookstores in Hay-on-Wye _ to
chance upon another book by Laurie Lee. That was ``As I Walked Out
One Midsummer Morning,'' an assembly of autobiographical vignettes
that begins with his departure by foot from Gloucestershire, bound
for far-away London. It ends with Lee in Spain, aiding the doomed
Loyalist cause in that country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   I've searched in vain for ``Cider With Rosie,'' and I promise to
return the copy that any reader may send, or will honor any advice
for seeking and finding it wherever. However, the teledrama is said
to be entirely faithful to the original, so I may comment on Laurie
Lee's most famous book with something approximating authority.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Lee was born in 1914 in the remote Cotswold Valley of
Gloucestershire. He had five older sisters and two brothers _ one
older, one younger _ and all were martialed by an unlettered and
eccentric but endearing mother who was deserted by her priggish
husband during the Great War, when Laurie was only 4.
</P>
<P>
   At age 19 he set off for London, obtaining menial work there
prior to his Spanish adventure, and after World War II he became an
administrative participant in the recovery of Britain's
motion-picture industry. He was already a prolific poet, gaining
praise for several collections of verse issued in the 1940s and
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Lee's poetic orientation is toward nature _ flora and
fauna, not excluding the raffish humanity of his acute familiarity.
He is rather like Robert Frost, but softer, sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   Only in his mid-40s did he turn to prose, for a reception that
was immediately rapturous. ``Cider With Rosie'' appeared in 1959
and was both a critical success and a commercial sensation in the
United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Masterpiece Theatre'' offering is exemplary in all its
production values, but the emotionally affecting bonus is the voice
of the aged Laurie Lee in occasional bits of voice-over narration
lifted verbatim from his text.
</P>
<P>
   He tells us that he was ``chance witness to the end of a
thousand years' life,'' when his rustic homeland had ``white roads
rutted with hooves and cartwheels, innocent of oil and petrol.''
``Cider With Rosie'' is a muted, lyrical celebration of a way of
life that has passed forever from civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   So is this nostalgia? Is it sentimentality? It is neither,
although the emotional response is as deep and probably more
genuine. ``Cider With Rosie,'' like all of Laurie Lee's prose and
poetry, is a reverie, a living dream of time long gone by, from a
sympathetic author whose inspired memory is the equal of his
descriptive talent.

RENOWNED BARBECUE RESTAURANT'S PITS WILL SOON MOVE TO NEW DIGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCKHART _ There will be a new altar here soon, a brilliant new
shrine to one of Texas' most revered cultural treasures _ barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are under way for the ceremonial placing of the pits at
the new Kreuz Market. Kreuz (pronounced krites) has long been
considered one of the top barbecue cathedrals in the state. Texas
Monthly magazine has crowned Kreuz as being among the best, and so
have the thousands of diners from Austin, San Marcos and San
Antonio who gladly travel to this Czech-German community on U.S.
183 about 20 miles east of San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   But those accolades were for the cavernous old buildings just
south of the square. Rick Schmidt, owner of Kreuz's, must vacate
those buildings by the end of August, and he has started
construction on his new restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a groundbreaking,'' he said, ``and some people
were a little upset with me because of it. So we're going to have a
pit-placing instead. That's a lot more important to a barbecue
restaurant than the groundbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The new pits, Schmidt promises, will be exactly like the old
ones. He already has official approval from the city fire marshal
and health inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Both are needed because at Kreuz, the meat is grilled over an
open pit while the customers stand in line nearby and absorb the
white-hot heat against their skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have the same kind of open-fire pits,'' Schmidt said.
``They will be identical to the ones we are using now. We'll still
put the barbecue on butcher's paper and we'll have the same
condiments.''
</P>
<P>
   That means there will still be no beans, no coleslaw. Only an
onion, tomato or avocado. There is a choice of white bread or soda
crackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business was not broken, so we don't intend to fix it,''
Schmidt said. ``We're just moving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt is losing his lease because he and his sister couldn't
agree on a new arrangement. He owns the business; she owns the
buildings. She has said she will run her own barbecue business in
the building. It will be called Smitty's Market, she said, named
after their father.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the family maneuverings, the question arises: Will
the atmosphere of Kreuz remain intact?
</P>
<P>
   It seems improbable. His place will be new; hers will be
remodeled before reopening.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to explain why the atmosphere at Kreuz is so
important. The long, dark hallway that leads to the pits is an
eerie walk. The old floors creak and the walls reek of smoke. The
pits are scorching hot and the workers have little time for
chitchat.
</P>
<P>
   They pull the meat from the fire, slice it, slap it on butcher
paper, weigh it and price it. Theirs is an assembly line designed
to move quickly and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining area, the hospital-green walls are dirty with
smoke and years of hard use. The paint is peeling in large flakes,
and in many places it is worn through to the chalky drywall.
</P>
<P>
   But a thick slice of beef on a grease-soaked sheet of brown
paper somehow transforms the drab room into a banquet hall. Big
Reds and root beer are sipped like sparkling water, and
conversations spill out among the diners like those at a family
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   It is a setting that will be hard to re-create.

ONCE-GENEROUS VISITOR NOW A NO-SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I need your help. I'm issuing an all-points bulletin for a
missing person. I've known her for years, and she's very special to
me. She's been to my home many, many times, but, unfortunately, I
don't have a picture of her.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I can't even give you a very good description because
I've never seen her face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I do know about this dear lady. One, she's very,
very fast.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking track-star, world-class-sprinter speed. And I think
she's American, but it's hard to say. My friend is very generous.
She's a bit of a night owl; she sleeps all day. She's quite the
social butterfly, and children adore her. She's petite in stature.
I guess that's why she wears high heels with those long, formal
gowns and the crystal tiara.
</P>
<P>
   She's never been married. It's hard to meet a nice guy when you
work at night. Let's see, she's very strong because she has to lift
stuff and haul it around all the time. And she's loaded. I mean big
bucks! That's all that I can tell you except that she has a most
unusual means of transportation. According to published reports,
she doesn't have a car. Instead, she has wings!
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone seen the tooth fairy?
</P>
<P>
   I need to get in touch with her. The last two times that she was
supposed to come by our house, she was a no-show.
</P>
<P>
   My son is quite upset about it. A few days ago, he came
barreling into my bedroom, clutching a little baby tooth in his
fist. ``Mom,'' he whined, ``the tooth fairy forgot to come again!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, shame on her. My husband glared at me from his pillow and
shook his head disapprovingly. Now, why is this my fault? I don't
even know how to contact this woman. She's been pretty reliable up
until recently. Almost without fail, she shows up in the middle of
the night, exchanges the tooth for money and leaves without a peep.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, I arrange all the doctor's visits, schedule the repair
people and plan the vacations. Why must I be in charge of the fairy
visits, too?
</P>
<P>
   I gave my son a reassuring hug and said, ``Maybe she left the
money in Mommy's wallet again. She does that when she's in a big
rush.''
</P>
<P>
   We checked my purse, but there was only a quarter and two
pennies in there. Dad's wallet was as barren as a desert. I called
911 and learned that the tooth fairy is at home recovering from
some minor surgery. It seems that she takes the baby teeth and
gives them to elderly people who don't have any teeth. I told you
she's nice. Well, while she was trying to deliver the teeth to some
needy grandma, she dropped the heavy bag of teeth and fractured her
big toe. Don't worry, she'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if you see her, please tell her to contact me. I had to
write my son a check! I want my $2 back.

</P>
<P>
   FANTASY FLIGHT: Critics have generally liked ``Pushing Tin,''
the romantic comedy about two fiercely competitive air-traffic
controllers, starring John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton. It's safe
to say most movie critics don't know diddly about guiding planes
from the heavens to terra firma. Viewers who do have a different
spin on the film, and they are not amused. (Includes 3-column color
photo from film ``Pushing Tin'' and 6-pica color photo of jet
landing at airport in heavy fog.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: STAR WARS SOUND: When George Lucas' fourth ``Star Wars''
film debuts May 19, it won't sound at some theaters like any movie
you've ever seen and heard before. (Includes 6-pica color photo of
Yoda from ``Star Wars.'')
</P>
<P>
   WITH: PHANTOM MENACE COUNTDOWN: A 2-column color graphic,
``Countdown to `Star Wars,''' outlining the number of days
remaining until `The Phantom Menace' opens.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: STAR FILE: This spring country music artist Kenny Chesney
tossed off his hat, put on a Hawaiian shirt, headed for the
Caribbean and produced the biggest song not only of his career, but
of country's Class of '99: ``How Forever Feels,'' a danceable,
cotton-candy tune that has ruled the charts for the past month.
(Includes 6-pica color photo of Kenny Chesney.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS: Ernst Lubitsch's beloved 1940 film ``The
Shop Around the Corner'' hits the Internet age in ``You've Got
Mail,'' giving director and co-writer Nora Ephron a chance to
reunite Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in a story ideal for their charms.
Also reviewed: ``Babe: Pig in the City.'' (Includes 18-pica color
photo from ``You've Got Mail.'')
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CD REVIEWS: After splitting from the British teen-dream
group Take That (``Back for Good''), Robbie Williams set about
changing his image. Also reviewed: Eric Benet (Includes 6-pica
color photo of Robbie Williams)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: COMMENTARY: Do people randomly maim and murder because
they see violence in films? No, they murder because they are
murderers, predisposed psychopaths. To suggest that Hollywood is to
blame for the tragedy at Littleton, Colo., is ridiculous. (Includes
1-column color photo from film ``Natural Born Killers.'')

   PONTIAC FIREBIRD TRANS AM: Although only 30 years old, the
Pontiac Firebird Trans Am is absolutely antediluvian. In fact, it's
wonderfully primitive, in other words, intended to appeal to
enthusiasts in their 30s and 40s who have the means to make their
old memories come alive. (Includes 3-column color photograph of
Pontiac Firebird Trans Am's exterior, 2-column color photo of

<P>
   WITH: AT A GLANCE: Fact box previewing the 1999 Pontiac Firebird
Trans Am.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SHARP DRIVING: Cars are not playthings, and children
should be taught that at an early age. They should never be allowed
to play in or around a parked vehicle. Nor should they ever be left
alone in one. (Includes 1-column color mug shot of columnist.)

</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble are finding
that the Web, while not yet a medium for profit, is a solid place
to sell books. Now, textbook sellers are getting in on the act.
(Includes one 1-column color photo of Yahoo! Internet Life
magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: Microsoft may not own the hearts and minds of
the computer world, but it doesn't need to. Its outsized battalions
are sitting there on the battlefield of your computer screen.
(Includes 1-column color mug shot of columnist.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRENDS: Clicking back and forth among various Web sites
covering the Columbine High School shooting wasn't anybody's idea

   WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS: Fort Wayne, Ind., is off the usual tourist
track, but history buffs and political junkies may just want to put
it on their itineraries this year. ``Lincoln From Life: As the

paintings, sculptures, photographs and sketches of Honest Abe.

   INVENTING TARZAN: The story writer John Taliaferro tells of
Tarzan's creator in ``Tarzan Forever: The Life of Edgar Rice
Burroughs, Creator of Tarzan'' could hardly be filled with more
surprises. Though Burroughs built a career writing about a noble
apeman swinging through the African jungle, the author never set
foot in Africa. (Includes 3-column B&AMP;W photo of Edgar Rice
Burroughs, 6-pica B&AMP;W mug of author John Taliaferro and 6-pica
color photo of book jacket.)

<P>
   WITH: NONFICTION PREVIEW: A preview of forthcoming nonfiction
books for the summer reading season.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: Of all sports, stock-car racing is the one
whose popularity is hardest to explain. In Formula One racing, at
least there's an element of artistry, cars quick as cockroaches
darting now left, now right. But a Chevy Monte Carlo roaring 'round
and 'round an oval? Scott Huler offers an amazing look at the
sport's appeal in ``A Little Bit Sideways: One Week Inside a NASCAR
Winston Cup Race Team.'' (Includes color mug shot of columnist)

   SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR OLD FACE: In the last decade, doctors have
come up with dozens of new ways to touch up your looks. They can
zap wrinkles with lasers or peel away mottled skin with chemicals.
They can suck fat out of chins, or deposit it in lips. But when it
comes to seriously overhauling one's visage, the face lift is still
the mainstay. And, if done right, the results are a vast
improvement over the old actress-in-a-wind-tunnel look. (Includes
3-column color illustration of a face, two color photos featuring
before and after shots of a woman with a face lift.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: BOOK EXCERPT: The ability of children to manage anger and
handle conflict is a topic of conversation in the wake of the
school shootings in Colorado. During the next four weeks, the
SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH page will feature excerpts from a book, ``Tired of
Yelling,'' that addresses the conflict issue. This week, Part 2
deals with reflexive defensiveness _ a conditioned, rapid,
automatic response of resistance children develop that limits
communication and shuts down learning (Includes 6-pica color photo
of book jacket.)

San Francisco _  &UR; RAW &LR;  _ In the world according to Juliano, cooked
food kills. ``Look at every other creature on the planet,'' the
single-name chef says. ``They're in absolute perfect shape, and
they do not eat cooked foods. That, to me, is universal proof.''
Now the raw-foods restaurateur is taking his message to the world
with ``RAW: The UNcook Book,'' released this month by
HarperCollins.

 CHRON   EDITORS NOTE: Marion Cunningham, best known for her revisions of 
 the Fannie Farmer cookbooks, now crusades to get more people to 
 cook at home. This column, based on her book ``Learning to Cook 
 With Marion Cunningham'' (Knopf, 1999), is expected to be 
 available every two weeks from the San Francisco Chronicle via 
 New York Times News Service. It especially targets novice cooks.  
   
   
 LEARNING TO COOK: Pasta Unites Italian and Mexican Flavors  
   
   
 By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO  _ Even if you are just a beginner, you don't have to
restrict yourself to a single cuisine or expected flavors. It's
great fun to try dishes that combine one or more traditions _ if
the dishes are built on ingredients that can make sense together
and are fairly straightforward to prepare.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago when I was visiting Southern California, I went to
a restaurant that succeeded at combining Italian and Mexican
cuisine. My past experience with fusion food is that it doesn't
always fuse. It can be difficult to get two disparate styles to
blend, but this restaurant really pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs were husband and wife, Mexican and Italian, and if
their marriage is as compatible and pleasing as their food, it must
be a great success.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that experience I've tried different pastas finished
with Mexican ingredients and found that they bring out the best of
both cuisines. So, today I'm sharing a Mexican-flavored pasta that
is simple to prepare. To carry the Mexican theme further you can
serve flour tortillas filled with crisp salad greens. Tortillas
with pasta is far from usual, but I think it's a pleasant surprise
here.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, you can prepare sauteed caramel pears the day
before if you like, but for the best flavor heat them in the syrup
just before serving, then dollop a little cream on top.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Marion Cunningham, Bay Area cooking teacher, is the author of &LR; 
 &LR; ``Learning to Cook,'' ``Cooking With Children,'' ``The Fannie &LR; 
 &LR; Farmer Cookbook'' and ``The Breakfast Book,'' among others. &LR;

PASTA WITH GREEN CHILES, TOMATOES &AMP; CILANTRO
</P>
<P>
   From ``Learning to Cook With Marion Cunningham'' (Knopf, 1999)
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon + 1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dry spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   2 medium-size yellow onions
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 (28-ounce) can crushed Italian tomatoes (get plain tomatoes
without added flavors or ingredients)
</P>
<P>
   1 (7-ounce) can green chiles, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches cilantro (cilantro is in the produce section of the
supermarket with the fresh herbs)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cooking the Pasta:  &LR; Put the water and 1 tablespoon salt in a
heavy-bottomed pot and place on a burner turned on high heat. When
the water boils, add the spaghetti. Using a fork, stir the pasta so
it doesn't stick to the bottom or sides of the pot. If the water
boils over, turn the heat down a little, but keep it boiling. It
usually takes about 12 to 15 minutes to cook spaghetti until it is
tender. Set a timer to start checking on doneness in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To test, fish a strand of spaghetti out of the water, run it
under cold water and take a bite. If it is tender and not firm or
hard, it is done.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the spaghetti in a colander in the sink. Don't worry about
a little leftover water. Put the spaghetti back in the pot and
cover the pot.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; While the Pasta is Cooking, Prepare the Sauce:  &LR; Peel and chop
the onions into small pieces. Put the pieces into a bowl. Peel and
finely chop the garlic and put into a small bowl. Put the olive oil
in a skillet and set over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and
cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes, until the onion is soft.
Spear a little onion with a fork and taste for softness.
</P>
<P>
   Add the garlic, tomatoes (juice and all), the green chiles,
vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Simmer for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the stems from the bunches of cilantro and discard. Chop
the leaves coarsely. Measure 1 cup of chopped cilantro and stir it
into the sauce. Taste the sauce and add more salt if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Put the drained spaghetti into a bowl, pour on the hot sauce and
mix and toss so the sauce coats all the spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>

sodium, 4 g fiber. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SALAD IN A TORTILLA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1 head iceberg or romaine lettuce
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   One tortilla per person is usually ample, but use more if you
are serving very hearty appetites.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 325.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Use about 1 teaspoon olive oil per tortilla. Smear one side
of each tortilla with olive oil. Put the tortilla oiled-side up on
a large piece of aluminum foil. Continue to oil the remaining
tortillas and place on top of the first one. Wrap the foil over the
tortillas and place in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the remaining olive oil, the vinegar and a little
salt; stir to mix well. Wash, dry and chop enough crisp lettuce to
make 3 cups. Toss with the oil and vinegar dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Finish the salad tortillas just before sitting down to eat. Take
each warm tortilla and put some salad into it. Fold each in half so
it can be picked up and eaten with the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SAUTEED CARAMEL PEARS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 ripe, firm pears (d'Anjou are the best variety, but Bartlett
work nicely, too)
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy cream (whipping cream)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the Pears:  &LR; Cut the stem off the pears. Peel the
pears, then slice each in half lengthwise from the stem end. Cut
out the center core and blossom nubbin from each pear half.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Making the Caramel Sauce:  &LR; Use a skillet or a shallow pan that
is large enough to hold the pear halves in a single layer.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pan on a burner, put the butter in the pan and turn
the heat to medium. When the butter is melted, add the sugar and
stir to mix with the melted butter. Stir until the sugar dissolves.
Keep stirring. Have the water near at hand to add as soon as the
butter and sugar turn golden, which means the syrup is caramelized
and very hot.
</P>
<P>
   Stand back a little and slowly add the water. Stir to blend.
When the syrup is well mixed and smooth, put the pear halves into
the pan in a single layer. Turn the heat down to low, cover the pan
with a lid or foil. Let the pears simmer in the syrup for about 6
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lift off the lid and, using the tip of a paring knife, gently
poke a pear half in the thickest part. If it seems soft, the pears
are done; if the pear feels firm, let the fruit simmer another 2
minutes. When the pears are done, remove from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   These pears are very nice served warm, but you also can serve
them at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Put each serving of 2 pear halves into a small bowl with some of
the sauce and spoon 2 tablespoons heavy cream over each serving.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>

 BREAKFAST IN BED  
 Easy but elegant dishes to make Mom feel special 
 &HT;       
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  The more things change, the more they stay the
same: These days, Mom may be a lawyer or a mechanic, and instead of
chatting over the back fence while hanging out the laundry, she may
keep up with her friends via e-mail.
<P>
   But she still expects flowers, a sentimental card and a little
old-fashioned pampering on Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Special recognition of motherhood has existed in different
countries for generations. In the United States, efforts to
designate a special day for honoring mothers go back to the 1870s,
though it wasn't until 1915 that President Woodrow Wilson, having
won approval from both houses of Congress, declared the second
Sunday in May America's official Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring flowers and cards takes little effort these days _
just a trip to the supermarket. But the pampering requires a little
more thought. For this mother, nothing says pampering like
breakfast in bed.
</P>
<P>
   It can be an elaborate treat prepared by the rest of the family
while Mom sleeps in or relaxes with the Sunday paper, or it can be
as simple as a glass of fresh juice, a cup of coffee and a
croissant on a tray with a couple of daisies.
</P>
<P>
   In planning the treat, children and Dad _ or any other adult in
the household _ first need to decide what Mom really likes. No
point in serving her freshly brewed coffee if she is a morning tea
drinker. Then they should realistically assess their cooking
skills. Party plotters shouldn't try to make oeufs en cocotte if
they barely know how to fry an egg.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, Dad or a teen in the family fancies
gourmet cooking, go for it: mac &LR; e &LR; doine of fruit, huevos rancheros,
eggs Benedict, popovers filled with truffled scrambled eggs, pecan
coffee cake, currant scones _ pull out all the stops.
</P>
<P>
   We've assembled a batch of breakfast recipes from Bay Area food
professionals that straddle the line between kitchen illiteracy and
oven panache. They require some cooking, but none demand advanced
skills or lengthy preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Webber, chef/owner of Cafe Kati, contributes simple
buttermilk waffles that his father prepared every Sunday morning,
including, of course, Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   From Bette's Oceanview Diner, one of Berkeley's prime breakfast
venues, there's a mouthwatering strawberry souffle pancake that
anybody who knows how to separate eggs can tackle.
</P>
<P>
   If Mom is the sophisticated type _ and if the budget isn't tight
_ you can do an at-home version of an elegant dish served at the
Black Cat in North Beach: small blinis topped with softly scrambled
eggs and caviar.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you fix, serve it on a pretty tray with a Champagne
flute filled with fresh-squeezed orange juice or a mimosa, along
with something hot to drink in a pretty china cup. Mom will feel
like the most spoiled woman in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and whatever you do, jot down the recipes and remember the
sources of good store-bought foods. After all, Father's Day is
practically around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SIMPLE PLEASURES DELIGHT MOM ON HER DAY &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
If you want to assemble rather than cook a Mother's Day breakfast
to be served in bed, adopt a few simple strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready a tray and a pretty napkin (preferably cloth), good
china and silverware.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever food you choose, buy the best, whether it's fresh
berries or jam, bagels or muffins. A meal as simple as coffee and
toast with marmalade can be wonderful if the toast is made with a
well-textured artisan bread, the marmalade is a thick-cut Scottish
import and the coffee is freshly brewed from just-ground premium
beans.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas for purchases and presentation:
</P>
<P>
   Freshly squeezed bottled juice _ orange, carrot, mixed berries.
Pour into a wine or champagne glass.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh strawberries. Wash; serve whole on a small plate with
brown sugar and sour cream on the side, or slice and sweeten
lightly and spoon into a dessert dish. For indulgence, add cream or
sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   Chunks of melon. Presliced is just fine. Serve in a dessert
dish.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of berries, melon and seedless grapes. Add a mint
sprig to the dessert dish for eye appeal and fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   Natural yogurt with a drizzle of honey. Place in a pretty glass
dish and decorate with fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh-baked bagel, plain or toasted; cream cheese and lox. A few
blades of chives on the plate are decorative and also add a subtle
onion flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh bakery muffins, Danish or scones. Buy a selection and
after Mom chooses, everyone else can dig in.
</P>
<P>
   Sliced baguette and mild, soft cheese _ brie, Camembert, fromage
blanc or fresh mozzarella. Pair fresh mozzarella with sliced
tomatoes; brie, Camembert or fromage blanc with a cluster of
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Challah or another soft bakery bread, plain or toasted, with
butter and marmalade, preserves or honey _ a selection would make
this extra-special.
</P>
<P>
   The best coffee, tea or hot chocolate you can find. If you own
an inexpensive hand milk foamers, you might even serve Mom a latte.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE PANCAKE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is a version of the popular souffle pancakes served at
Bette's Oceanview Diner in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Grand Marnier (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 basket strawberries, washed, hulled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler, placing a rack 4 to 5 inches below the
heating unit.
</P>
<P>
   Separate the eggs and reserve 1 of the yolks for another use.
Beat together the remaining 2 egg yolks and the half-and-half.
Slowly stir in the flour, then the sugar, salt, melted butter and
optional Grand Marnier.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks. Fold the egg
whites into the batter, then fold in 1 cup of the sliced
strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly grease a 10-inch nonstick skillet with an ovenproof
handle, or a cast-iron skillet until almost smoking. Pour the
batter into the pan and reduce heat to medium. Cook until the
bottom is nicely browned and the batter has begun to firm up, about
5 minutes. Arrange a few berry slices over the top in a circular
pattern. Place the pan on the rack in the broiler and broil until
the top of the pancake is brown and the center is just set but
still a little soft, about 3 to 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Slide the pancake onto a large warmed plate and decorate with
the remaining strawberries. Dust with powdered sugar and serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2.

 &UR; JARLSBERG OVEN OMELET &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This dish, adapted from ``Omelettes, Souffles &AMP; Frittatas,'' by
Lou Seibert Pappas (Chronicle Books, 1999), is ideal for youngsters
who are wary of sputtering skillets on the stove _ it cooks
entirely in the oven.

frozen hash browns.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces cooked lobster meat
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon clarified butter, or 2 teaspoons butter + 1
teaspoon flavorless vegetable oil (see note)

   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Pick over the lobster meat and remove any bits of shell.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the clarified butter, or butter and oil, in a 6-inch
nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot but not smoking. Add
the lobster meat and saute, stirring, until warm, about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the eggs and season with salt and pepper. Scramble loosely,
stirring constantly with a wooden spoon; do not overcook.

 &UR; BLINIS WITH EGGS AND CAVIAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This elegant dish, by Scott Warner, is a favorite at the Black
Cat restaurant in San Francisco. Dot the top with creme fraiche and
more caviar, then sprinkle with chopped chives. In a pinch, you can
make blinis from a mix found at some specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Blinis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup milk
</P>

   1 teaspoon creme fraiche or sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon chopped chives
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the blinis:  &LR; Heat the milk in a small pan until bubbles
appear around the edges. Pour into a small bowl and let cool to
warm-room temperature. Add the yeast and stir until dissolved.
Whisk in the two flours, the salt and sugar. Cover with plastic
wrap and let rise in a warm place until foamy, about 11/2 hours, or
overnight in the refrigerator. The batter will be thin.
</P>
<P>
   Just before you are ready to cook the blinis, add the lightly
beaten egg yolk to the batter. Beat the egg white until soft peaks
form; fold into the batter.
</P>
<P>
   May be refrigerated at this point for up to 8 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a griddle or nonstick pan to medium; grease lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon batter into the pan in 2-tablespoon-size portions. Cook
until golden brown, turning once. Remove to a warm plate and keep
warm while you prepare the topping.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; To prepare the topping:  &LR; Melt the butter in a small nonstick
skillet. Reserve about 1 teaspoon of the melted butter in a small
cup. Add the eggs to the pan and cook, stirring constantly with a
spatula, until just set. Fold in half of the caviar.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle the reserved melted butter on the blinis and pile the
eggs on top. Garnish with creme fraiche or sour cream; top with the
remaining caviar and the chives.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Bette's Buttermilk Pancakes Stack Up Better 
 Than the Rest  
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Several people in the Food department thought they
had the best recipe for buttermilk pancakes until they tasted this
version from Bette's Oceanview Diner in Berkeley.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Owner Bette Kroening has been making these pancakes there for
nearly 20 years. They have become so popular that she even started
a line of packaged mixes that can be bought all around the Bay
Area, including in some Safeways.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these _ as well as all of the all-American
specialties at the diner _ so good is they are made fresh. The
baking soda, baking powder and buttermilk work to make these
lighter and fluffier than just about any you'll find.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Bette's Oceanview Diner, 1807 Fourth St. (between Virginia &LR; 
 &LR; Street and Hearst Avenue), Berkeley; (510) 644-3230. Open daily &LR; 
 &LR; for breakfast and lunch. &LR;

 &UR; BETTE'S BUTTERMILK PANCAKES  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   Choice of berries, sliced bananas, raisins or chopped toasted
nuts (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Oil for griddle
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in
a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly beat the eggs with the buttermilk, milk and melted
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Just before you are ready to make the pancakes, add the liquid
ingredients to the dry ingredients all at once, stirring just long
enough to blend. The batter should be slightly lumpy.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to add fruit or nuts, stir them in now, or you may
sprinkle them on the pancakes while they are on the griddle.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a lightly oiled griddle or heavy skillet over medium-high
heat (375 degrees on an electric griddle).
</P>
<P>
   Pour 1/4 cup batter per pancake onto the griddle or skillet,
spacing the pancakes apart so they do not run together. When
bubbles appear on the surface of the pancakes and the undersides
are lightly browned, turn and cook for about 2 minutes longer,
until lightly browned on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately on warmed plates with the topping of your
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 (yields about 24 four-inch pancakes.)

 BUDDING CHEF WRITES ABOUT `UNCOOKING' IN THE RAW  
   
   
 By Holly Ocasio Rizzo  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  In the world according to Juliano, cooked food
kills.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Look at every other creature on the planet,'' the single-name
chef says. ``They don't even get cavities in their teeth. They're
in absolute perfect shape, and they do not eat cooked foods. That,
to me, is universal proof.''
</P>
<P>
   He drops another little piece of Thai coconut into a blender and
presses a button. The problem with cooking, he says, is that it
zaps the digestion-aiding enzymes in food; in compensating for the
loss, the body focuses on digestion, diverting energy from making
other enzymes that cleanse and heal.
</P>
<P>
   The blender's whir fills Organica, the Inner Sunset restaurant
formerly called Raw Experience that has brought him to the cusp of
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never drink water,'' he says. ``You don't know what it picks
up from the pipes. Water in jugs is stagnant, and it creates
packaging, which isn't good for the planet. So I drink coconuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipe for the smoothie he's making isn't in ``RAW: The
UNcook Book,'' a volume more than two years in the making that
HarperCollins released  &LR; May 1 &LR; . The sweet-smelling combination of
organic coconut, date and strawberry is impromptu.
</P>
<P>
   The cellular phone rings. Juliano becomes all business. The
caller talks about juicers and the possibility of wrangling Juliano
an endorsement deal. After all, Juliano's profile is rising _ a
Spin magazine interview earlier this year; a page to order his book
on the Web site for actor Woody Harrelson's West Hollywood
oxygen-and-raw-foods bar, O2; and, now, book-promotion appearances
set up for ``Late Night With David Letterman'' and other television
shows.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to picture Juliano on such shows. Would he wear
jams and a long-sleeve Gotcha Surf Co. T-shirt, white socks and
dark athletic shoes, like he's wearing this day? Would he pull back
his past-the-shoulders hair with a rubber band or let it flow
freely?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the world will see. But his true background may remain
hidden; his biography is as soft as his science, pleasantly
morphing to fit the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Born Juliano Brotman 29 years ago _ he sometimes says 25 _ he
was raised in his father's meat-heavy Italian restaurant and in
front of a TV set in his parents' Las Vegas home. He quit school,
he says, when he was 8. At 15, he moved with his family to Palm
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   His father ``fired'' him from the restaurant that year for
refusing to cut his hair, he says. So Juliano, school-free, spent
his days exploring Tahquitz Canyon, a ribbon of natural oases
slashed into a desert mountain.
</P>
<P>
   There, the teenager had his culinary epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``An eagle soared out from the distant trees down to the pool
and ascended with a fish clamped in her talons,'' he writes in the
preface to ``RAW.'' ``Frogs sunbathed on giant rocks. And I, for
the first time, felt a part of nature instead of a distant
bystander watching the world on the tube.''
</P>
<P>
   He immediately became vegetarian, he says. At 19, he became
vegan, giving up all animal products. Finally, he went raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been four years since I ate cooked food,'' he says. ``For
the first year-and-a-half, I cheated. I ate cooked vegan foods I
made myself, and when I did, I felt awful.''
</P>
<P>
   To eat raw properly, don't go cold-turkey, he advises. ``You
need the grains, the rices.'' In ``RAW,'' he describes raw-food
preparation, but a novice needs to seek nutrition advice elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Juliano swears to this: Without cooking, his energy grew _ he
sleeps as little as two hours a day _ and he felt his thinking
become clearer and quicker. In search of like-minded individuals,
he moved to San Francisco to join an ayurvedic yoga center.
Practitioners of ayurveda, originally a Hindu medicine system,
follow dietary recommendations such as always eating hot food in
cold seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said cooked rice is, like, 5,000 years old, and I said
raw was, like, before fire,'' Juliano says. ``So I moved out of the
yoga center and got into the restaurant. I just opened the
restaurant to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother financed the venture, which opened in 1994, serving
meatless meatloaf made of portobello mushrooms and nuts, burritos
wrapped in cabbage leaves, and cheese-free, meat-free burgers
served on breadlike sheets of sprouted buckwheat baked 10 hours in
the sun. His sister helped develop the recipes.
</P>
<P>
   His celebrity clientele grew _ Robin Williams, Michael Milken,
Steve Jobs and Bryan Adams among them. He started teaching
``uncooking,'' even training Harrelson's O2 chef, he says. To keep
up, he splits most of his time between San Francisco and a Santa
Monica community center with a raw-foods kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   He's selling Organica, he says, though he'll still teach
uncooking there. ``It was so much work. I just stood right there
behind the counter for four years for 15 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then about a year-and-a-half later, I realized I was changing
the planet. It was like junk food, raw food, gourmet food. There
were, like, nine cuisines of the world, and now there's 10.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, he works on his next career: screenwriting. He
hopes to use his raw-food talents to connect with Hollywood
financial backers. And, if they don't follow, he's still the new
guru on the block preaching the gospel of clean cuisine for long
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have this light feeling from eating raw,'' he
says. ``I needed chocolate every day of my life before. Once you
eat torte made of carob and dates, you won't even think about
chocolate. And you get all this energy from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is change your addictions, and you're a
healthy person.''

 &UR; The Raw Deal &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
If you're thinking about living on raw alone, you'll need to
prepare before jumping in.
</P>
<P>
   That's because a plants-only diet requires careful balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to a vegan diet, go to a registered dietitian
or your doctor to make sure you're meeting your dietary needs,''
says Tammy Baker, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the
American Dietary Association, a national professional organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``With careful planning and supplements, you can make a vegan
diet work. All it would take to learn how would be one visit to a
doctor or a dietitian.''

 BAY AREA CLASSICS: Scopazzi's Was Built a Log at a Time  
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 BOULDER CREEK, Calif. _   For the citizens of San Francisco, the
1906 earthquake and fire were unimaginably disastrous. For others,
it created golden opportunities.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the lucky ones were loggers, in high  &LR; il,0l,0,12p,6p6
 &LR; demand for felling the trees to rebuild the city. Their fortune
was the origin of Scopazzi's, a restaurant in the Santa Cruz
Mountains where the pots of spaghetti sauce have bubbled ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the establishment, founded by A.M. Locatelli, was a
boardinghouse for loggers. The two-story building still stands, but
it's been added onto over the years _ the cozy redwood dining room
in the mid-'20s, the brightly lighted bar with large-screen TV and
a casual dining area in the '60s. That was after ownership _ and
the name of the restaurant _ had passed to the Scopazzis, an
Italian immigrant family with many ties to the Bay Area food scene.
</P>
<P>
   The senior John Scopazzi, known in the family as nono(CQ) &LR; ,
owned and operated the Boulder Creek restaurant from 1955 to 1986;
his son John is a former head of the highly regarded Hotel and
Restaurant Program at San Francisco City College.
</P>
<P>
   That John's son _ Johnny to the family _ operates Scopazzi's in
San Rafael. The restaurant used to be known as Guido's when it was
run by Johnny's uncle, Andy Scopazzi.
</P>
<P>
   The senior John's brother, Giuseppe, was a cook at original
Joe's, and his son, Joseph, was a waiter at Taddich Grill for a
quarter-century until his retirement a few years ago _ and the list
goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nono'' (grandpa) John still lives in Boulder Creek and still
owns the building of the restaurant that he sold to two former
employees, chef Paul Violante and front-of-the-house man Talal
Janbay.
</P>
<P>
   Violante started working in restaurants as a schoolboy in Santa
Cruz; by the time he was 18, he had his first job as chef. His
Italian background was a perfect fit with Scopazzi's. His partner,
a one-time librarian, started as a Scopazzi's busboy 20 years ago
when he came to this country. ``I went straight from Beirut to
Boulder Creek,'' he says with a grin. He has worked in a few other
places, but ``I always come back to Boulder Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Scopazzi name, Violante and Janbay have retained
the Italian character of the restaurant. In fact, some '50s menus
displayed along with historical photos aren't much different from
today's (except for the prices) _ prosciutto with melon, chicken
cacciatore, saltimbocca, cannelloni a la Romana, scaloppine and, of
course, a full range of pasta dishes.
</P>
<P>
   One popular appetizer, marinated artichoke hearts, has been a
Scopazzi specialty for decades: ``John (Scopazzi senior) and I get
together in the garage each spring and fix them,'' says Violante,
``both for ourselves and the Scopazzi's in Marin.'' The pair puts
up about 60 gallons and 40 quart jars.
</P>
<P>
   Violante says his clientele is a mixture of locals and people
who come from ``over the hill,'' meaning Silicon Valley and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The local population swells during the summer months, which
means more customers. And when there is high fire danger and
campers aren't allowed to light fires, business also booms.
</P>
<P>
   But what about heavy rains and frequent power outages in the
rugged Santa Cruz Mountains during winter?
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' Violante says with a laugh. ``We have a contract
with PG&AMP;E.'' So when the power goes off, not only do locals flock
to the restaurant, but there also may be as many as 50 utility
company workers chowing down on the likes of minestrone, veal
piccata and spumoni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kitchen runs on gas,'' Violante says, ``and for light, we
keep candles on the tables; it's real romantic.''

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Panelists Underwhelmed In a Sea of Tortillas  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Choosing flour tortillas can be a daunting task.
We found 11 different kinds, including nonfat and low-fat
varieties, at local markets.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe the tasting panelists have been spoiled by the fresh
handmade tortillas available in the Mission, because overall they
were underwhelmed by what's available at Bay area supermarkets.
They found many brands too chewy or tough or with little flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The tortillas all were wrapped in foil and heated before
serving.
</P>
<P>
   First place was split between  &UR; Trader Jose's  &LR; (12 count, 24
ounces, 79 cents at Trader Joe's) and  &UR; Whole Foods Fat Free &LR;  (6
count, 10.5 ounces, 99 cents at Whole Foods). All the panelists
commented on the dry texture of Trader Jose's, but one thought it
would probably work well with wet dishes, such as fajitas. Three
panelists liked the flavor. Three would buy it, one might buy it,
and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   None of the panelists suspected the Whole Foods Fat Free brand
was fat free (all the other low-fat and nonfat tortillas scored too
low to rate). Two panelists commented on the classic, traditional
appearance. Another liked the toasty, floury taste. Two would buy
it, one might buy it; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Trader Jose's Truly Hand Made  &LR; (12 count,
18 ounces, $1.59 at Trader Joe's), which scored only one point
lower than the two first-place winners. Some panelists noted an
overwhelming sweet flavor; others commented on the thickness. One
thought this tortilla would hold up well as a wrap; another liked
it on its own as a snack. But one panelist picked up an off flavor
on the finish. Two would buy it, two might buy it, and one would
not.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to the full-fat variety of  &UR; Whole Foods &LR;  (6
count, 10.5 ounces, 99 cents at Whole Foods). Two panelists liked
the toasty flavor, but two others thought it was too dry. One
panelist thought it looked and tasted more like pita than a
tortilla. One would buy it, one might buy it, and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Leona's &LR;  (12 count, 32 ounces, $1.99 at Whole Foods) came in
fifth. One panelist thought it was too salty and detected buttery
notes (it is not made with butter). One panelist described it as
``not offensive, but not very good.'' Others liked the flavor. Two
would buy it, one might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions varied on  &UR; Guerrero &LR;  (12 count, 17 ounces, $1.59 at
Safeway). One panelist thought it was the best of all the kinds
tried, and another thought it had a great tender texture. But
others disliked the thinness. One would buy it, two might buy it,
and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Other tortillas that scored too low to rate were Mission,
Mission 98% Fat Free, La Tortilla Factory, La Tortilla Factory 99%
Fat Free, La Tortilla Factory Fat Free.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Patricia
Hart, dietitian and consultant; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For
All Seasons, San Francisco; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati,
San Francisco. All products are tasted blind.

THE SWEETNESS OF CORN SET OFF BY THE TARTNESS OF BLACKBERRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the sixth of eight columns by Claudia Fleming, the pastry
chef at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan. Her collaborator on these
columns is Melissa Clark.  
 By CLAUDIA FLEMING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, I ordered an unusual dessert in a small Mexican
restaurant. Sweet-corn ice cream sounded intriguing, but it turned
out to be a disappointment, riddled with distracting icy kernels.
Still, I love corn and was taken with the idea of a perfectly
smooth corn ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Then I began wondering, ``What would I pair it with?'' Still
under the influence of my Mexican meal, I toyed with the idea of
refining a corn tortilla and came up with a twist on a French
classic: a cornmeal crepe. The buttery crepes cried out for a tart
counterpoint, and a minimally sweet blackberry compote adds just
the right vibrancy to the dish. It looks beautiful, too, with its
deep magenta drizzle of sauce.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a little early for fresh corn, but the Florida
varieties that are just coming into the markets are surprisingly
sweet. They are also slow to turn their sugar into starch and can
withstand the long haul of shipping. But, of course, this ice cream
will be at its best as the weather warms and local sweet corn
begins to appear.
</P>
<P>
   As the dish developed, the flavor of the ice cream became
elusive. At first bite, it's barely discernible. But it creeps up
on you, growing more distinct and delicious as the ice cream melts
into a rich custard sauce, surrounding the crepe.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never made crepes before, rest assured that they're no
more difficult than pancakes. Turning them is the only tricky part.
I use my fingers, gently lifting the edge of the crepe and quickly
flipping it back onto the pan.
</P>
<P>
   But for beginners, I recommend using a narrow metal icing
spatula or even a butter knife paired with a metal or plastic
spatula. (A rubber spatula is awkward for this maneuver.) First run
the spatula or knife around the edges to loosen the crepe, then
flip it, straightening it out if it wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   The crepes and the blackberry compote can be made several hours
ahead, even a day ahead. Store the compote in the refrigerator, and
warm it thoroughly over low heat before serving. Be sure to keep
the crepes wrapped in plastic or foil until you are ready to serve
them.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, I trim the crepes into squares for a
presentation like a floppy Napoleon. But you don't have to bother _
and besides, this is such a summery dessert, you don't want it to
appear too fussy.
</P>
<P>
   CORNMEAL CREPES AND BLACKBERRY COMPOTE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus 8 hours' chilling
</P>
<P>
   { vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped off
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   ~ cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   { cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   9 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   Melted butter for the pan, if necessary
</P>
<P>
   1 quart blackberries
</P>
<P>
   Sweet-corn ice cream (see recipe).
</P>
<P>
   1. Place vanilla seeds in a blender with the milk, flour, cream,
6 tablespoons of the sugar, eggs and salt. Blend until smooth. Pass
mixture through a fine sieve, and stir in cornmeal. Cover and chill
at least 8 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Heat a heavy, preferably nonstick, 8-inch skillet over
medium-high heat. (If not nonstick, brush with butter.) Add about 3
tablespoons crepe batter to pan; swirl so that batter just coats
bottom of pan. If too thick, pour any excess batter back into bowl.
Cook crepe until bottom is browned and small bubbles appear on top,
about 45 seconds. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side,
about 30 seconds. Remove to a plate, and repeat with remaining
batter, buttering pan occasionally if crepes begin to stick. Makes
about 30 crepes.
</P>
<P>
   3. To make the compote, combine half the blackberries, 2
tablespoons water and 3 tablespoons of the sugar in a saucepan over
medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until blackberries
give up their juice and sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Turn off
heat; stir in remaining berries.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, place a crepe on a plate, then using a slotted
spoon, top with some compote. Top with another crepe and more
blackberries, then finish with a third crepe. Spoon some blackberry
liquid around crepe, and garnish with a scoop of ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   SWEET-CORN ICE CREAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus 1 hour's resting and 4 hours' chilling
and freezing time
</P>
<P>
   4 ears fresh sweet corn, shucked
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   } cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   9 large egg yolks.
</P>
<P>
   1. Using a large knife, slice corn kernels off cobs, and place
in a large saucepan. Break cobs into thirds, and add them to pot
with milk, cream and { cup of the sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring,
then turn off heat. Using an immersion mixer, puree corn kernels.
(If you don't have an immersion mixer, remove kernels with slotted
spoon, puree in a blender, and return to pan.) Let rest 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bring mixture back to a simmer, then turn off heat. In a
small bowl, whisk egg yolks and remaining sugar. Add a cup of the
hot mixture to yolks, stirring constantly so they do not curdle.
Add yolk mixture to the saucepan, stirring. Cook over medium-low
heat, stirring constantly, until custard coats spoon, about 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pass custard through a fine sieve, pressing down hard on the
solids. Discard solids, let custard cool, then cover, and chill at
least 4 hours. Freeze in an ice cream maker according to
manufacturer's directions.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 3{ cups.

ASPARAGUS: THE SKINNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fat asparagus spears have their charms, but pencil-thin spears
have two distinct advantages in a time-sensitive kitchen. They can
be cooked without peeling, because their outer sheaths are so
tender, and they cook so much faster, which is an asset for
roasting.
</P>
<P>
   Thin asparagus can be roasted in 12 to 15 minutes, which makes
the spears shrivel, brown slightly and gain complex flavor. It
would take at least twice as long to do that with thick spears. And
the flavor would not be as striking because a pound of thick spears
has less surface area than a pound of thin ones and therefore less
area to brown.
</P>
<P>
   I like to roast thin spears until they're tender, then top them
with coarse fresh bread crumbs and Parmesan. Run that under the
broiler for a minute or two, and you get roasted asparagus with a
crunchy, high-impact crust. Just watch the dish while it's under
the broiler so it doesn't burn.
</P>
<P>
   For the cheese, I think real Parmigiano-Reggiano is best, but
pecorino or other hard sheep's milk cheese does a nice job.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the bread crumbs coarse if you can to give crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Variations
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is easily varied. For instance, forget the topping
and toss the spears with 1 tablespoon of minced garlic when you add
the oil, then roast. Skip the broiler step.
</P>
<P>
   For roast asparagus with soy and sesame, use 1 tablespoon peanut
oil instead of olive oil or butter. Halfway through roasting, add 1
tablespoon of soy sauce to the asparagus, toss gently and finish
roasting. When the spears are cooked, top with about 2 tablespoons
of sesame seeds and run under the broiler until they pop, about 1
minute. Finish with a teaspoon or two of soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED ASPARAGUS WITH CRUNCHY PARMESAN TOPPING
</P>
<P>
   Time: 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 thick slice good bread
</P>
<P>
   1 small chunk Parmigiano-Reggiano, about 1 ounce
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds thin asparagus, more or less
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter, extra virgin olive oil, or a combination
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat oven to 500 degrees; while it heats, put bread in, and
check frequently until it is lightly toasted and dry. Coarsely
grind or grate bread and cheese together (a small food processor is
best), and keep crumbs larger than commercial bread crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   2. Rinse asparagus, and break off woody bottoms. Lay stalks in a
baking dish that will hold them in two or three layers. Toss with
bits of butter or the oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and place
in oven.
</P>
<P>
   3. Roast 5 minutes, then shake dish to redistribute butter or
oil. Roast 5 minutes more, then test for doneness by piercing a
spear with point of a sharp knife; it should slide in but meet a
little resistance. (Up to this point, the recipe can be made as
much as two hours before serving; just leave asparagus at room
temperature).
</P>
<P>
   4. Turn on broiler and place rack as close as possible to
heating element. Top asparagus with cheese-crumb mixture and run
under broiler to brown, a minute or two. Serve hot or at room
temperature.  &QL;

TV SHOWS AND VIDEO GAMES TEACHING CHILDREN TO KILL, PSYCHOLOGIST
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By his own reckoning, Lt. Col. David Grossman is ``the flavor of
the day.'' ``60 Minutes'' has recently come calling, with NBC's
``Today'' show and ``Court TV'' not long behind. Print and
broadcast journalists otherwise fill up Grossman's day in 15-minute
interview chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman's message explains his new notoriety, one as timely as
it is troubling. He is a former Green Beret, West Point psychology
professor and now a widely quoted expert on how soldiers are taught
to kill. Those same methods, he says, are also being employed on
our children through the debased images of television and video
games. For children, Grossman says, the media amounts to boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``In boot camp, your head is shaved and you're taught to reject
old values and accept that the world is a dark and dangerous
place,'' says Grossman, author of the 1995 bestseller, ``On
Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and
Society.'' ``Then you're put on the rifle range and killing is made
a conditioned response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if we're troubled that we do that with 18-year-old
soldiers or a 22-year-old in the police academy, how much more
troubled should we be that we do that to children?'' Grossman says.
``The average preschooler watches 27 hours of television a week,
which is absolutely infected with violence. And they become
convinced, like the Army convinced me in boot camp, that the world
is a dark, dangerous place.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, Grossman and others contend, is an epidemic of youth
violence of which the tragedy of Littleton, Colo., is but the
latest and most horrifying example.
</P>
<P>
   The murderous rampage of teen-age gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, following so quickly after similar incidents in Arkansas,
Oregon and Kentucky, has renewed spasms of national soul-searching
and finger-pointing. Bad parenting has been one common target. But
the world has never been short of parental abuse and neglect, some
commentators say.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is the coarsening effect of television, and a
generation of increasingly realistic and sophisticated video games
often used by the military to simulate warfare. For children, those
games are common entertainment fare, games that dehumanize and
desensitize and place a premium on body counts.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, Grossman says, that witnesses to the Colorado
rampage recount the euphoria of Harris and Klebold as they went
about their grim business. Both were devotees of point-and-shoot
interactive games such as Doom.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike soldiers, Grossman says, ``We're not just teaching kids
to kill. We're teaching them to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The link between media and youth violence is scarcely new,
Grossman says. Among several studies in the past 20 years, he cites
a 1992 report by the American Medical Association that concluded
that half of all homicides in the United States would not have
occurred but for the influence of television. The link between
media violence and violence in real life, Grossman says, is
stronger than that between cigarette smoking and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence is like the nicotine in cigarettes,'' says Grossman,
whose work was recently quoted by President Clinton. ``The reason
why the media has to pump ever more violence into us is because
we've built up a tolerance. In order to get the same high, we need
ever-higher levels. ... The television industry has gained its
market share through an addictive and toxic ingredient.''
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis psychologist David Walsh, whose 1994 book ``Selling
Out America's Children'' explored similarly deleterious effects of
media violence on children, agreed that while the media is not the
only source of the problem, it might be the most damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silver lining in Littleton, if there can be a silver
lining, is that it will send a message that we just can't insert a
very, very powerful teacher into our kid's lives, one of the most
powerful teachers they will ever have, and think they won't have an
impact,'' says Walsh, founder of the National Institute on Media
and the Family. ``We have to choose our media as carefully as we
choose our baby sitters. And yet we often turn on the television
before finding what's on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't going to throw out their televisions or their
video games,'' Walsh says. ``But they have to realize this is
having an effect.''
</P>

   Walsh says his organization is preparing a list of suggestions
for families seeking to regain control of their children's viewing
and video game habits. An example: Turn off the television during
mealtimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of this whole story is the lack of parental connection
with those kids,'' Walsh says. ``Sixty-six percent of America's
families have the television on during at least one meal a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, whose second book ``Teaching Kids to Kill'' will be
published later this year, envisions more aggressive measures. He
expects to be called as an expert in the $130 million lawsuit filed
this month against several entertainment companies, an action that
contends that violent computer games, Internet pornography and a
violent movie contributed to a 14-year-old's 1997 school-shooting
rampage in Paducah, Ky. Media companies could eventually be under
legal attack as tobacco companies are today, Grossman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feed your children death and horror as entertainment,
don't think you won't reap something terrible from that,'' Grossman
says. ``Anyone who thinks that couldn't happen is in abject denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children are totally immersed in a culture of death and
warfare, not for weeks, as in boot camp, but for years. Not every
child will be turned into a mass murderer. Not every person who
smokes will get cancer. But every child will be affected by it, one
way or another.''

   Pelligrini Cabernet Sauvignon Cloverdale Ranch 1996, Alexander
Valley, Calif. About $17.
</P>
<P>
   Some vines at the Pelligrini Cloverdale Ranch in Sonoma County,
Calif., are more than 40 years old, which prompted the winemaker,
Merry Edwards, to do two fermentations.
</P>
<P>
   She put the old vine grapes, about 40 percent of the total, into
small open-top tanks and the rest in stainless-steel rotary
fermenters. The wine was then aged for 15 months in American and
French oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a rich, plummy, opaque wine with a nice, long
finish. It is an elegant wine and a very good value.

LITTLETON SHOULD PROMPT RETHINKING ABOUT VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETALUMA, Calif. _ In the past 18 months, our nation has
experienced seven suburban school massacres. All of the
perpetrators have been boys.
</P>
<P>
   Only 40 percent of public school students questioned in the most
recent annual ``State of Our Nation's Youth'' survey said they
always feel safe at school. And about 60 percent said they don't
believe all available steps have been taken to assure their safety
and security.
</P>
<P>
   It is critical to rethink our approach to stopping the violence
in our schools, homes and culture in general. Most
violence-prevention programs in our schools have aimed at stopping
the sexual violence that many girls experience _ from sexual
harassment to rape.
</P>
<P>
   In order to take the discussion about violence and conflict
resolution to the next level, we must give as much attention to
male-on-male violence.
</P>
<P>
   While a male-on-female focus is essential, most violence in our
culture, including in our schools, is directed at males, not
females.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1998, of the 226 deaths _ including suicides _
on school campuses, 174 of the victims were boys.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky boy who went on a killing spree in West Paducah
knew well the pain of violence. Time magazine reported that other
boys often flicked water on him in the school lavatory and stole
his lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The week before his rampage, he told an evaluator a couple of
boys threatened to beat him up in the band room. When he pulled a
handgun in response, they taunted him: ``You couldn't hurt anyone
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Time also reported that all the boys responsible for school
carnage were teased because they were either underweight or
overweight, yet virtually all school programs about body image
focus on girls.
</P>
<P>
   While research shows that 40 percent of girls and 15 percent of
boys report having a negative body image, the key word here is
``report.'' Boys are much less likely to admit having such a
concern; to do so would not be ``manly.''
</P>
<P>
   One member of the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' in Littleton, Colo., told
the Denver Post that life was ``hell ... pure hell.'' He said
athletes called him a homosexual, bashed him into lockers and threw
rocks at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't describe how hard it was to get up in the morning and
face that,'' the 18-year-old told the newspaper. ``I'm not saying
what they did was OK,'' he said. ``But I know what it's like to be
cornered, pushed day after day.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether in war, in street brawls or on athletic fields, violence
is a tool by which men subjugate men and boys subjugate boys. And
let us remember, aggression is biologically ``wired'' into humans.
We learn violence from our culture.
</P>
<P>
   After his murderous rampage in Pearl, Miss., the young shooter
said his brother, eight years his senior, ``used to pick on me _
beat me _ when I was little.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told authorities that in his whole life he had been
``ridiculed, beaten and hated.''
</P>
<P>
   We must focus on the hundreds of ways males are humiliated and
harassed in the culture of cruelty in which they live. We can then
address male-on-male violence with as many resources as we have
toward male-on-female. Such an approach will truly reduce violence
in our schools.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the second year in a row, New York's restaurants
and chefs have captured the majority of the major national awards
bestowed by the James Beard Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Trotter, the chef and owner of Charlie Trotter's in
Chicago, was an exception, named the country's chef of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons was selected as outstanding restaurant; Babbo
was best new restaurant; Union Square Cafe was cited for the best
wine service, and Le Bernardin won the overall service award.
Marcus Samuelsson of Aquavit was selected rising star chef of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the regional awards, Lidia Bastianich of Felidia (whose
son, Joseph, is a co-owner of Babbo) was named best chef in New
York, and Melissa Kelly of the Old Chatham Sheepherding Company Inn
in Old Chatham, won as best chef in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Other national awards went to Marcel Desaulniers of the Trellis
in Williamsburg, Va., as outstanding pastry chef and to MC2 in San
Francisco for best restaurant design.
</P>
<P>
   The awards were among more than 40 presented Monday night at a
black-tie dinner at the Marriott Marquis given by the foundation,
which is named for the legendary culinarian, who died in 1985. It
was formed in 1986 and has been presenting awards since 1991. To
chef and restaurateurs at least, these are almost the Academy
Awards. About 400 food and wine professionals around the country
chose the winners.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, 28 chefs considered to be rising stars by
the foundation served dozens of dishes to the crowd of nearly
2,000. Those in ascendancy included Milos James of James at the
Mill in Johnson, Ark., preparing corn dogs, and Dante Boccuzzi of
Silks in San Francisco, who made burgundy-braised beef cheeks.
Jacques and Laurent Pourcel, the twins whose restaurant, Le Jardin
des Sens, in Montpellier, France, has three Michelin stars, also
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean-Georges: Cooking at Home With a Four-Star Chef,'' by
Jean-Georges Vongerichten with Mark Bittman (Broadway Books, $35),
was named the best book by chefs or restaurants. Bittman also won
the award for best general cookbook for his own ``How to Cook
Everything'' (Macmillan, $25).
</P>
<P>
   ``Smokehouse Ham, Spoonbread and Scuppernong Wine'' by Joseph E.
Dabney (Cumberland House Publishing, $27.95) was named cookbook of
the year. Trotter's ``Charlie Trotter's Desserts,'' with
photography by Tim Turner and Paul Eldridge (Ten Speed Press, $50),
won for food photography.
</P>
<P>
   Other cookbook winners included ``Saveur Cooks Authentic
American'' by Colman Andrews and Dorothy Kalins (Chronicle Books,
$40) and ``Mediterranean Greens and Grains'' by Paula Wolfert
(Harper Collins, $27.50). A surprise winner, perhaps not to every
cook's taste, was ``Man Eating Bugs: The Art and Science of Eating
Insects'' by Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio (Ten Speed Press,
$19.95). One very specialized wine book was a winner: ``1855: A
History of the Bordeaux Classification'' by Dewey Markham Jr. (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons, $69.95).
</P>
<P>
   The James Beard Foundation was not the only group recognizing
cookbooks this spring. The International Association of Culinary
Professionals also gave Bittman's ``How to Cook Everything'' its
best general book award at its convention in Phoenix two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook of the year was ``Desserts by Pierre Herme'' by Herme
and Dorie Greenspan (Little, Brown, $35). Some other winners were
``Every Grain of Rice: A Taste of Our Chinese Childhood in
America'' by Ellen Blonder and Annabel Low (Clarkson Potter, $25)
and ``Apples'' by Frank Browning (North Point Press, $24).
</P>
<P>
   Complete listings of the winners from both organizations are
available on line at www.starchefs.com.

TRAMPING FOR RAMPS, A SURE SIGN OF SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: W.Va., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENSSELAERVILLE, N.Y. _ Bill Bensen, the chef of the Palmer
House Cafe here, was tramping through the woods two weeks ago,
searching for signs of green ramp tips breaking the frosty ground
cover, insisting that spring had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   He was still layered in polar fleece and a parka, his breath
forming wisps in the chilly air. Even so, he was mentally composing
dishes for his annual Rampage, the almost-all-ramp menu served each
spring in his 20-seat cafe in this upstate hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``See! Over there! The green!'' he yelled, jumping up and down,
either in excitement or for warmth. ``When it gets a little warmer
in that dell, this whole place will smell like onions!''
</P>
<P>
   Let the meek extol the virtues of mild-mannered cultivated
leeks. Real cooks forage for ramps. The leafy, bulbous, aromatic
plants, the wild cousins of leeks, sprout in rich forest soil from
Canada to Georgia, and as far west as Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Ramps have more heat and bite than leeks or scallions and, when
cooked, a soft nutty taste rarely found in either garlic or onions.
</P>
<P>
   Ramps tend to cluster near groves of sugar maples. Foragers like
Bensen know better than to try to pick a ramp. Their root systems
are so deep and entwined that only a shovel can scoop six inches
beneath the earth and loosen a clump of ramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know three things for sure,'' he said as he knelt to clear
frost and old leaves and pine needles from one of his favorite ramp
patches. ``First, ramps on the perimeter of the patch are usually
bigger. Secondly, they can look like lily of the valley, which are
poisonous, so if the plant doesn't smell like onion, don't eat it.
And the third thing I know is that for every ramp I dig, two more
come the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lexicographers say the word ``ramp'' was Middle English for
wild garlic, others say for wild leeks. But people around here say
the similarity to ``tramp'' explains the name. The tramping and
digging, cleaning and cooking required to turn muddy,
garlic-smelling bulbs and their leafy greens into a toothsome
delicacy play no small role in ramp mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Bensen walks about a mile into a rocky forest in the Helderberg
Mountains and digs for about an hour to get a bushel of dirt-caked
ramps (32 quarts), which need to be trimmed of their roots and
outer sheaths, then soaked in cold water and rinsed repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about two hours to clean and cook a bushel of ramps,
and the hunter-gatherer is left with only two to four cups of
cooked greens. About 55 ramps make a pound; when cooked, they will
serve three people as a side dish or an ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   But the triumph of emerging from the dark woods, a ramp-filled
bushel basket balanced on the end of a shovel, makes all the effort
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Ramp-rich places tend to be isolated little hamlets like
Rensselaerville, and many of them celebrate the aromatic delicacy
with festivals in springtime like Bensen's Rampage. The Ramp Romp
in Helvetia, W.Va., is probably the best-known revel, serving up
ramp chili, ramp home fries, ramp omelets, ramp pie, batter-fried
ramps, scalloped ramps and potatoes, ramp slaw, and corn-bread
sandwiches with pulled pork and raw ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Similar dishes can be found in Elks' lodges and church basements
throughout Appalachia and New England, and parts of the Midwest and
the South, from late March to mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs in cities tend to take a more sophisticated tack with
ramps, which are heaped high in bunches in the Union Square
Greenmarket in Manhattan at this time of year. Union Square Cafe
features a gratin of ramps, potatoes and Gruyere cheese; Home
offers ramp and mint pesto; Verbena serves blini with grilled
ramps, and Gotham Bar and Grill serves farfalle with ramps, cremini
mushrooms, pea shoots, Parmesan and white truffle oil.
</P>
<P>
   Ramps are often braised in wine or grilled, but that robs them
of their full nutty flavor. It blooms only when they are covered
with olive oil, braised until tender and allowed to rest in a
covered dish. Rural cooks use pork or goose fat instead.

   After they are braised, ramps can be served in a vinaigrette,
laid onto pizza or added to pasta or risotto. The oil or fat they
have flavored can then add a blast of spring-in-the-woods to shad
or shad roe, chicken, game or shellfish _ although you won't
usually see much shellfish in places where you see lots of ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Bensen's Rampage last weekend was the sort of event that
celebrates one of the things that tiny hill towns hold in common.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 guests, who ate family style _ johnnycakes with wilted
ramps and creme fraiche; scalloped ramps and potatoes topped with
shad roe; a spring ragout of ramps with spinach, fiddlehead ferns
and morels, topped with chicken from the Palmer House Cafe smoker _
were in complete accord: ramps are worth the work.

   RAMPS BRAISED IN OLIVE OIL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 50 minutes, plus 10 minutes resting time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups olive oil, plus more if necessary
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds ramps (approximately 6 bunches), cleaned
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place olive oil in a large, shallow pan with a tight-fitting
lid over high heat. When oil is warm, roll a bunch of ramps in
paper towels to remove excess moisture, and unwrap. Reduce heat to
medium and add ramps to pan. Toss to coat each leaf with oil.
Working quickly, dry second bunch and add to oil, tossing until
ramps wilt. Continue with remaining ramps, adding more oil if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   2. When all ramps are wilted, season to taste and reduce heat to
low, then stir and cover pot. Cook 5 to 10 minutes, depending on
the size of the ramps, stirring frequently to avoid burning. When
ramps are very, very tender, remove pan from heat and let sit,
covered, for 10 minutes. Season again if desired, and serve.

   2. Place a heavy pot over medium-high heat and warm olive oil.
Add chopped ramp bulbs and greens. Toss quickly to soften, about 2
minutes. Add rice and stir for several minutes. Add wine, stir and
cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Begin adding the warmed broth, a cup or so at a time,
stirring and cooking for 5 to 15 minutes between additions. When
rice has lost its rock-hard center, add spring greens. Stir and add
the reserved ramp bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   4. When greens have wilted, add butter and half the cheese.
Taste. Each grain of rice should have a firm center, and the
mixture should be soupy. If necessary, add more water or broth and
cook a few minutes, stirring occasionally. Add thyme, season with
salt and pepper and serve, garnished with remaining grated cheese.

A PEAK EXPERIENCE AT ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK, Colo. _ One after another, each
vehicle comes to a screeching halt.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly screeching, given the pace around daunting
Medicine Bow Curve almost 12,000 feet above sea level and near the
summit of the Trail Ridge Road.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sight of three bull elks _ their majestic antlers
rising toward the heavens atop a cliff only a few yards from the
alpine roadway _ does slow traffic to an even slower crawl.
</P>
<P>
   And it represents the highlight of this visit to Rocky Mountain
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight, that is, until a couple of hours later when, upon
descent into Horseshoe Valley, a herd of bighorn sheep plods across
the road almost within breathing distance, making its daily food
pilgrimage to a lush green meadow and seemingly oblivious to dozens
of wide-eyed human onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Until the next morning beside Bear Lake where a lone mule deer
tiptoes onto a walking path, the longing expression in its eyes
saying clearly, ``Any leftover lunch in that backpack?'' It's a
notion shared by a brilliant blue Steller's jay that perches
perhaps six inches away on a rock overlooking the rippling water.
</P>
<P>
   Until evening in downtown Estes Park, just outside the park's
eastern boundary, where cowboys and cowgirls and wanna-be cowhands
gather 'round a campfire to sing and swap stories in the crisp
mountain air.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks refer to a vacation in Rocky Mountain National Park _
whose majestic vistas include 113 named peaks higher than 10,000
feet _ as traveling ``to the top of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of the 3.2 million annual visitors, it represents the
perfect vacation world, especially in summer when the snow-capped
mountains serve as an idyllic backdrop for outdoor adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Situated only 65 miles northwest of Denver, the nation's
10th-oldest national park _ flanked by the down-home friendliness
of Estes Park and of Grand Lake to the west _ also beckons those
whose only passion is to unwind from big-city pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Climb a mountain or spend the day languishing on a cabin porch
beside a babbling brook. Hike from dawn to dusk, from one
glacier-fed lake to another, or spin your fishing reel _ or your
chompers _ at a rainbow trout.
</P>
<P>
   This is, above all, a feast for the senses _ wondrous wildlife,
wildflower bouquets, stark alpine tundra giving way to deep spruce
forests, the lilting sounds of competing songbirds, the captivating
aroma of cinnamon rolls fresh from the oven at an Estes Park
bakery.
</P>
<P>
   But where to begin?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TRAIL RIDGE ROAD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 75 percent of park visitors traverse the
spectacular 40-mile Trail Ridge Road (U.S. 34), among only 11
scenic byways accorded ``All-American'' status by the Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Dating to 1932, it's the nation's highest continuous paved road,
reaching an altitude of 12,183 feet above sea level. More than 10
miles are at elevations of 11,000 feet or higher, and the road is
never lower than 8,000 feet. Because winter blizzards result in
snowdrifts as deep as 30 feet, upper stretches are usually open
only from about Memorial Day to Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   If you leave your car to explore the landscape more closely _
and chances are you will _ move slowly. The thin air can cause
dizziness. And admire those elk, and other wildlife, from a safe
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to spend much of a day here, too. Always a time-consuming
drive _ in part because the myriad visual pleasures encourage
lingering _ the Trail Ridge Road will demand even more patience
this summer when repairs reduce one short segment near Rock Cut
(elevation 12,110 feet) from two lanes to one.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeding east to west from Estes Park, choose either U.S. 34
or U.S. 36 (Beaver Meadows Road, along which the park headquarters
is located); these highways meet at Deer Ridge Junction where the
Trail Ridge Road commences. A park entrance fee of $10 per vehicle
is required, but it's valid for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Obtain and consult a complimentary map/guide upon entering, and
as you approach Hidden Valley, Rainbow Curve and the Lava Cliffs,
those monikers will take on deeper meaning. At almost every turn,
the eyes are mesmerized by another vista _ perhaps an unusual rock
formation, waterfall or silver stream. Numerous lookout points
encourage stopping.
</P>
<P>
   At an 11,716-foot elevation, signs point to the Forest Canyon
Overlook, a five-minute walk that yields panoramic views of gorges
where ice once stood 1,500 feet thick.
</P>
<P>
   Several twists and turns later, just past the highest point on
the road (near Rock Cut), a favorite stop _ for literature, snacks,
bathrooms or for surveying miles and miles of towering mountains
and verdant valleys _ is the Alpine Visitor Center located atop the
Fall River Pass. Take time to admire a vast natural amphitheater
that collects enormous amounts of snow blown by winds that can
exceed 200 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing toward the west and south, the 10,758-foot Milner
Pass is on the Continental Divide. The scenic road ends just north
of Grand Lake (at the park entrance for those traveling in the
opposite direction).
</P>
<P>
   All along the route, be on the alert for glimpses of elk, deer,
bighorn sheep, beaver, coyote, chipmunk and marmot. Moose, black
bear, fox, mountain lion and bobcat also live here but in small
numbers and are rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
   In September and October, more than 3,000 elk gather in meadows
for an annual mating ritual in which the bull elk _ with antlers as
wide as 5 feet _ lifts its head, stomps the ground and makes a
bugling sound that can be heard for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Westbound motorists primed for adventure can veer off the Trail
Ridge Road in its initial climb, choosing instead the 10.9-mile
gravel Old Fall River Road from Horseshoe Park to Fall River Pass.
This original park road, completed in 1920, usually opens about
July 4 and is one-way, uphill, with severe switchbacks that make
travel impractical for pulled trailers.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK, Colo.: pulled trailers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who relish a more up-close encounter with the land and
its elements, outdoor recreation opportunities abound.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 350 miles of trails, the park has particular
appeal to hikers regardless of their skill levels, endurance or
time restraints.
</P>
<P>
   A half-day trip to Bear Lake, at the eastern edge of the park,
is recommended especially for those who want to appreciate nature's
wonders without working up a sweat. A half-mile trail, with only a
20-foot elevation gain, circles the lovely lake. Many of the park's
250 bird species live near here, and it's not unusual to see deer.
One caution: The lake's elevation is 9,475 feet, so novice hikers
should drink fluids and pause frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Several longer, more arduous trails also depart from Bear Lake.
From Estes Park, take U.S. 36 west to Bear Lake Road. Continue to
the lake or, to avoid congestion, stop at the Glacier Basin parking
area and take a shuttle bus.
</P>
<P>
   At Sprague Lake, also accessed via Bear Lake Road, a half-mile
trail is completely level and ideal for travelers in wheelchairs.
The Sprague Lake Handicamp here is designed to accommodate visitors
with disabilities; usage is by reservation only with a three-night
limit (call 970-586-1242).
</P>
<P>
   A short distance away, the quarter-mile Moraine Park Nature
Trail provides a good introduction to identifying local plants and
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Also popular: short ``Tundra World'' trails from the Forest
Canyon and Rock Cut overlooks high on the Trail Ridge Road; and a
one-mile trek in the western part of the park to Never Summer
Ranch, an early 20th-century homestead and dude ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Back-country hikers planning an overnight stay must obtain a
permit ($15); call 970-586-1242 or stop at the park headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The park includes 150 lakes and 476 miles of streams, and
fishing is permitted in many areas (but never in Bear Lake). A
valid Colorado fishing license is required, and use of live bait is
prohibited except under specified conditions. Some waters are
restricted to protect recently reintroduced cutthroat trout.
</P>
<P>
   More than 260 miles of trails are open to horseback riders; a
park ranger can provide details. Guided tours on horseback are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycling is popular on the Trail Ridge Road, Bear Lake Road and
Beaver Meadows Road but is not permitted on trails. Bicyclists
entering the park pay a $5 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Five roadside campgrounds fill fast in summer, so it's wise to
plan ahead. Reservations are required for camps at Moraine Park and
Glacier Basin and cost $14; call 800-365-2267.
</P>
<P>
   On summer days, park rangers schedule several nature-oriented
programs, including bird-watching excursions and lectures on birds,
biology and ecology.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ESTES PARK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ute and Arapaho Indian families so appreciated a valley situated
just to the west of what is now Rocky Mountain National Park that
they made it their summer home for 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   That tradition continues in Estes Park, most visitors' favorite
overnight base for park adventures because of the small community's
wide range of accommodations _ riverfront cabins and lodges,
condominiums, bed-and-breakfasts, small motels and the Stanley
Hotel, built in 1909 by F. O. Stanley of Stanley Steamer fame.
</P>
<P>
   The compact downtown area includes dozens of arts and crafts
shops, restaurants and ice cream parlors. Even more appealing are
well-manicured gardens, parks, playgrounds and aspen groves. And
you can never be certain when an elk or deer will meander down a
street.
</P>
<P>
   If much of the town appears new, there is good reason: In 1982,
a man-made dam burst inside the park, sending the Fall River out of
its banks and down Elkhorn Avenue, the main street, causing major
destruction. But townspeople implemented an impressive renewal
project.
</P>
<P>
   Music is an integral part of life in Estes Park. Beginning in
mid-June, campfire sing-alongs are conducted Thursday through
Saturday evenings at 7:30 in Bond Park. Weekend musical festivities
also occur in Barlow Plaza. SummerFest concerts, all free, are
scheduled at the Estes Park Center/YMCA of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Music in the Mountains, a series of chamber music concerts, is
another staple on Sunday afternoons from late June into August at
Rocky Ridge Music Center nine miles south of town. Admission is
$10.
</P>
<P>
   Annual events include the Jazz Fest &AMP; Art Walk (May 22-23),
featuring downtown jazz concerts; the Wool Market (June 19-20), the
largest natural fiber show in the country; and the Scandinavian
Festival (June 27-29), with music, food and folklore.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors here are never far, though, from the haunting beauty
and spirit of Rocky Mountain National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when that elk blocks your path into a souvenir shop.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've proceeded from the Denver International Airport
toward (or around) town, take Interstate 25 north, then U.S. 34
west through Loveland to Estes Park and Rocky Mountain National
Park. Or approach Estes Park from the south on Colorado 7.
Traveling from the opposite direction, enter on U.S. 34 (which
becomes the Trail Ridge Road) just past Grand Lake.

 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Few foods cross as many boundaries as the french fry.
It is trashy fast food in a paper pouch, it is the inseparable
partner to hanger steaks in lively brasseries, it is the austere,
perfect batonette, a work of fine chefs.
</P>
<P>
   And it is as pervasive as it is adaptable. With bistro food
becoming the everyday equivalent of pizza and countless Belgian
restaurants serving frites, the french fry seems to be everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But wherever it appears, it is nothing more than a slice of
potato deep-fried and seasoned with salt.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't think something so simple could cause so many major
groups _ from university agricultural research centers to cookware
manufacturers _ and legions of restaurant cooks to obsess. But it
has. And now I join them.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking decent enough french fries is easy, something even a
beginner can handle. But getting that perfect fry _ long, thin as a
chopstick, speckled with salt crystals large enough to feel on your
tongue, brown as toast, nutty but not too greasy, and, like a
ficelle, crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside _ requires
enormous synergy. There is potato variety to consider. Cooking fat,
temperatures and equipment, too.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to master french fries at home, I worried over the
various techniques and tried them all. Over the last few weeks, the
smell of cooking fats _ from peanut oil to beef fat _ has taken
over my apartment. I've eaten my weight in french fries.
</P>
<P>
   But I did not start in the kitchen. I started on the street.
Balthazar beckoned. Its fries _ best enjoyed at the bar with a
drink _ are potato and oil harmonized. Served like thin pencils
lined up in a cup, they are as crunchy as chips on the outside,
amply potatoey but not dry. A lemon mayonnaise on the side is
dangerously good. So good, in fact, that as I covered a fry like a
sock with the mayonnaise and ate it, I forgot about the fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have such a fine line between an excellent french fry and
a not-so-excellent french fry,'' said Riad Nasr, an executive chef
at the restaurant. He uses Idaho potatoes, which the cooks peel,
soak in refrigerated water for eight hours, cut into long thin
sticks and soak for eight hours more before frying. The soaking,
Nasr said, is the secret to the crisp texture of the fries. It
draws out the starch, making them more rigid and less likely to
stick together. The cooks fry them twice, first blanching them
until slightly limp in peanut oil heated to 325 degrees, and again
in 375-degree oil to crisp and brown them. All for something that
costs just $6.
</P>
<P>
   At Patroon, one cook's sole job is to do the french fries.
(Imagine the turnover rate.) Les Halles treats them like caviar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very hung up on our fries around here,'' said
Anthony Bourdain, the chef at Les Halles. ``It's the first thing I
look at when I come in in the morning.'' The fries are a little
fatter and more moist than those at Balthazar _ like creamy mashed
potatoes in a crisp shell.
</P>
<P>
   How Les Halles arrives at them, though, couldn't be more
different. The potatoes are hardly soaked at all and are cooked at
different temperatures. ``Too much starch leaches out and it
changes the sugar content and the starch,'' Bourdain said. ``All
the good stuff ends up in the water, and the potato starts behaving
weirdly.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first sign of trouble. I began to sense a long road
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to get in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   First, I focused on technique, deciding whether to cut and fry,
or go the extra mile and soak. To simplify, I used Idaho potatoes
and peanut oil for these initial forays.
</P>
<P>
   And I regret to report that going the extra mile was markedly
better. I peeled the potatoes and soaked them in water for eight
hours, then cut and soaked them for eight hours longer. Before
frying them, I laid them out on dish towels and let them dry
completely. (This is important to prevent oil from bubbling up when
the potatoes are dropped in.) The double-soaked fries snapped under
my teeth and seemed lighter.
</P>
<P>
   I dredged one batch in potato starch before frying, as some
fast-food restaurants do to assure a crisp outer shell. The fries
were crisp, but the starch gathered into tiny balls on the surface
and did not brown well.
</P>
<P>
   I also played around with the temperatures, blanching some fries
at 275 degrees and finishing them at 375, others at 300 and 400.
The trick is to fry them as quickly as possible, so they have less
time to absorb the oil, but not so quickly that they brown before
they cook inside. Fries cut the way I like them _ slightly thinner
than a quarter of an inch _ cook quickly. Blanched at 300 degrees,
the fries cooked through in two minutes without browning. And
finishing them at 375 made it easier to control the browning. At
400 degrees, many charred before I had a chance to strain them.
</P>
<P>
   Testing french-frying equipment was an unfortunate detour.
Initially, I gravitated toward the highly specific: french fry
cutters and an electric deep-fryer that controlled the temperature.
</P>
<P>
   French fry cutters are much like garlic presses, squeezing the
potato through a sharp grid. But they cut too thick _ more than a
quarter-inch in even the smallest grid. And it is impossible to
push through a whole potato. So you end up with fat, stubby sticks
that look like nuggets, not fries. Mandolines work, but so does a
chef's knife.
</P>
<P>
   I got out a ruler and began cutting the potatoes lengthwise into
sticks. They weren't what you would call perfect, but I found that
this variety translates into more taste variability. The thinner
ones brown and have a deeper nut flavor; the thicker ones stay
blond and heavy on potato flavor.
</P>
<P>
   An electric deep-fryer was possibly the least pleasurable piece
of cookware I've ever used. It was much like using a washing
machine and looked like one on the counter. You pour the oil in,
heat it, add the potatoes and close the lid. And you have no idea
what's going on inside until the buzzer goes off. It was promptly
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Again, I resorted to basic equipment: a stove-top deep-fryer.
The most effective model is a large round pan, about six inches
deep, with tall handles where the metal basket can rest to let the
oil drain. I hooked a candy thermometer on the side of the pan to
regulate the temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Next I addressed the ingredients, first and foremost the
potatoes. I had always considered the Idaho potato _ its proper
name is Russet Burbank _ plebeian, something that large growers
pushed on the American public because it was cheap to grow and high
in yield. Baked, it has about as much appeal in the mouth as
ground-up chalk.
</P>
<P>
   But almost every chef I spoke with used it. And I discovered
myself that it does have a greater purpose when fried in oil. Its
interior expands like a souffle and turns creamy, and its exterior
becomes crispy before absorbing too much oil. And coloring the
outside, which means caramelizing the potato's sugars, gives it
just the right bitterness. French fries need a touch of bitterness
and loamy flavor, smoothed out with fat.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When a potato is deep-fried, its water content is replaced by
the fat; you want a potato that has more solids than liquids, so it
absorbs less oil.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of frozen french fries and fast-food companies are well
aware of this. Researchers at the University of Idaho and the
University of Guelph in Ontario have been working for years to
develop potatoes that outshine the ubiquitous Idaho. One potato
grown for Nestle USA, a maker of frozen french fries, is the Ranger
Russet. It is longer than the Idaho, has a higher percentage of dry
matter and suffers less from ``hollow heart,'' a growth problem
that makes it impossible to cut long fries. The agricultural
biotechnology division of Monsanto Co. hopes to introduce a
high-solids potato in a few years for the commercial market. For
consumers, more solids means less oil to clog arteries; for
restaurants, less oil means lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, french fries are made with a yellow-flesh potato
that is dense and fairly dry. B. Frites, a Belgian french-fry
takeout restaurant near Times Square, uses the Maris Piper, grown
in Colorado. It replicates the Belgian potato, said Skel Islamaj,
the chef. He gave me a few to try. They have a more rounded flavor
and a less mealy texture, and are more filling than the Idaho. They
make a great fry. But alas, they are not available to buy. Only the
Idaho is.
</P>
<P>
   Salt was about the only ingredient I was set on. I wanted large
crystals that melt on the tongue and crunch under the teeth. The
only solution: a coarse salt. Kosher salt is pleasant, mellow and
appropriately humble for a dish of potatoes and oil. Fries seasoned
with fleur de sel weren't bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   As much as great french fries are about the flavor of the
potato, the cooking medium really does matter. Canola oil gives
fries a cleaner flavor than most oils, but more flavorful cooking
fats deepen their taste.
</P>
<P>
   Pure peanut oil, which most chefs use, balances well with
potatoes: The fries feel clean in the mouth, with a light, nutty
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   When I lived in France, I used to fry chunks of waxy potatoes in
duck and goose fat. Cooking fries this way is no different. The
availability and price of duck fat in the United States is,
however. So to two quarts of peanut oil, I added seven ounces of
store-bought duck fat. The fries cooked in it were richer, rounder
in flavor and devilishly good. And they were an indulgence that
cost very little: Seven ounces of duck fat is $5.50 from
D'Artagnan, (800) 327-8246; Dean &AMP; DeLuca sells 24.6 ounces of
goose fat for $10.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick: adding a little bacon to the peanut oil. As about
two quarts of oil was heating, I put in a piece of bacon about
three inches long. The fries were subtly smoky and delicious. I
also tried a piece of prosciutto. It tinged the oil with a light
pork flavor. Perhaps the best part, as with the bacon, was eating
the prosciutto afterward, when it had cooked up to a salty chip.
</P>
<P>
   Though the very idea is probably repellent to even adventurous
palates, horse fat is actually the traditional cooking fat for
fries in some parts of Belgium and France. I tried to track some
down, without _ no surprise _ much luck. But I was able to get my
hands on beef kidney knobs (the fat surrounding a cow's kidney) to
render beef fat, which is difficult to buy already rendered. Until
the 1990s, after all, McDonald's used beef tallow for its fries.
(Now it uses ``healthy'' hydrogenated oils.)
</P>
<P>
   When the 15-pound box arrived, my doorman looked at me
suspiciously. Fifteen pounds of dry, white, waxy chunks of fat is a
great deal of fat. I pulled the chunks apart and packed them into a
stockpot. Many hours of gentle heat later, I had more beef fat than
I needed in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   When I fried the potatoes, the oil was so thick the potatoes
stayed in place, as if they were levitating. They browned
beautifully, with thin, dark lines along each edge. They took more
salt and, even cooked and eaten in the morning, were the best of
all the fries I made. What was McDonald's thinking?
</P>
<P>
   No matter how good they were, things had gotten a little
ridiculous. It was time to stop obsessing.
</P>
<P>
   But the next time I have fries _ though it may be a while _ I
will trust my cheap Idaho potatoes and peanut oil and will go to
work with my simple knife, round pan and strainer. And I will
definitely whip up some of that lemon mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH FRIES
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes, plus 16 hours' soaking time
</P>
<P>
   4 large, long Idaho potatoes
</P>
<P>
   Peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt or coarse sea salt.
</P>
<P>
   1. Peel potatoes. Place in a bowl, cover with water and
refrigerate 8 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Slice potatoes lengthwise into sticks \ inch thick. Place in
a bowl, cover with water and refrigerate 8 hours more.
</P>
<P>
   3. Drain potato sticks and lay out on dish towels to dry. Be
sure they are completely dry before frying.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a large stove-top deep-fryer with a candy thermometer
clipped to the side, heat 2 inches of peanut oil to 300 degrees.
Add just enough potatoes to cover the base of the frying basket and
cook until slightly limp, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Do not brown. Lift
basket and drain fries. Transfer potatoes to a baking rack and
separate sticks. Repeat with remaining potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   5. Increase heat to 375 degrees. Again add potatoes in batches
to the oil. Fry until chestnut brown on edges and crisp. Drain and
transfer to a bowl lined with paper towels. Immediately season with
salt, tossing to coat. Serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: For a slight pork flavor, to every 2 quarts of oil add a
3-inch slice of bacon or prosciutto. For duck flavor, to every 2
quarts of oil add 7 ounces of duck fat.
</P>
<P>
   LEMON MAYONNAISE FOR FRENCH FRIES
</P>
<P>
   Time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon champagne vinegar

</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together egg yolk, mustard,
vinegar and a pinch salt.
</P>
<P>
   2. Whisk in peanut oil, starting a drop at a time and moving to
a slow steady stream, until sauce is emulsified. Whisk in olive
oil, then lemon juice. Adjust seasoning; serve immediately. Can be
stored 4 days in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: About 1 cup.

VICTIMS GROUPS CARRYING BANNER FOR JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Gathered in a circle, sipping Diet Cokes and
nibbling cocktail wieners, they could be any church group or PTA.
But conversation soon turns to life in the wake of heart-rending
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Eight mothers and a father trade tips about how to ease the pain
that comes with birthdays, Christmas and the anniversary of a
child's killing. One has photographs of a daughter in a coffin.
Another can't bear to touch a slain son's homemade Christmas
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   No one else, they say, can possibly understand.
</P>
<P>
   The twice-monthly meetings of Parents of Murdered Children's
Tarrant County chapter are part of a quiet revolution. Over the
past 20 years, services and support groups have drawn victims into
the criminal justice process, making them informed and influential
participants in prosecutions, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for groups like this, I'd probably go insane,''
said Carolyn Barker, the grandmother of 19-year-old Amy Robinson,
who was kidnapped and killed last year on her way to work at an
Arlington, Texas, grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a growing network of scholars, lawyers and civil
libertarians say that the victims movement has gone too far by
promoting legislation that robs defendants of many constitutional
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is this: (Victims) are often co-opted by either a
police or prosecutory organization,'' said Keith Hampton,
legislative chairman of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers
Association. ``They're now saying, `Who do we blame and how badly
can we punish them for that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Tarrant County, at least 17 victims organizations have been
established in the past 20 years. These groups focus on assisting a
wide range of victims, including battered women, children, and
relatives of slain police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Victims can tell their stories at probationers' boot camps and
court-ordered seminars for drunken drivers. They are consulted
during prosecution and reimbursed by the state for losses resulting
from crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like night and day,'' said Jim Sinclair, assistant
director of the Community Supervision and Corrections Department.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of these local groups stay away from politics,
groups like Justice for All based in Houston, or JFA, have evolved
into an aggressive presence in Austin. The 4,500-member
organization _ founded by Pam Lynchner, a victim of sexual assault,
six years before she died with her two daughters in the 1996 crash
of TWA Flight 800 _ has successfully fought for legislation
focusing on defendants.
</P>
<P>
   This includes laws that restrict capital murder appeals, keep
the capital clemency process closed and allow for the voluntary
surgical castration of sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't half-step,'' said volunteer lobbyist Rusty Hubbarth,
a tough-talking ex-Marine who once challenged state Sen. Royce West
to a duel. ``That's what either attracts or repels people to JFA.
(Legislators) are either part of the solution or part of the
pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   JFA President Dianne Clements co-founded the group with Lynchner
soon after Clements' son, Zachary, died in an accidental shooting
by a friend playing with a parent's 12-gauge shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice for All believes the lives of innocent citizens should
take precedence over the perceived rights of a guilty individual,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of overwhelming powerlessness and irreversible loss,
Clements and other victim advocates say, activism gives them a
meaningful way to channel their anger.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda O'Quin helped found the Tarrant County chapter of Parents
of Murdered Children after her son, Michael McEachern, was killed
along with teen-ager Katy Nesbit during a robbery in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel so isolated during the (judicial) process. You feel
so powerless,'' she said, adding that activism ``gives back a
little bit of control.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics, the efforts of victims groups like Justice for All
are part of a growing infringement on defendants' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has executed 67 inmates since the 1995 capital appeals
changes, far outpacing other states and drawing international
scrutiny from media and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 20 years, we've been systematically dismantling
the portion of the Bill of Rights that protects people who have
been accused of crimes,'' said Donald Jackson, a Texas Christian
University political science professor and president of the Fort
Worth chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``One stream
of that is the notion that we're more concerned about protecting
criminals than victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine states, including Texas, have passed constitutional
victims' rights amendments with little opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, victims advocates are pushing for a federal
constitutional amendment that would mandate a victim's right to
attend trials and other judicial proceedings. The proposed
amendment is in a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas and other states, defense attorneys can exclude victims
from the courtroom if they say they intend to call them to the
stand.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment could allow some victims to alter their accounts
before they are called as witnesses, said Robert P. Mosteller, a
Duke Law School professor of criminal procedure and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Because it could result in a flood of false courtroom testimony,
the amendment has raised serious concerns among legal scholars,
Mosteller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very bad idea,'' he said.

DALLAS FILM FESTIVAL: ODD WINNERS AND LOSERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dallas' USA Film Festival emerged from its 29th annual
installment intact, but just barely. The Dallas Observer went after
the festival as if it owed it money. True, the weekly alternative
newspaper could justifiably take the festival to task for making
some odd choices, but then, that's what film festivals are about.
</P>
<P>
   It's also true that many of the festival movies had premiered on
cable, or were about to, like the opening-night premiere ``Dash and
Lilly,'' whose title was similar to the winner of last year's short
film competition _ ``lily and jim.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dash and Lilly'' wasn't a hilarious skewering of
expectations about the dating scene. Instead, it sought to push
down the veil of illusions about America's royal couple of
literature, Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Kathy Bates, an SMU graduate, co-star Sam Shepard
had the right hair color, if not exactly the right stuff _ he
looked as if he were loping off the range to pull burrs out of his
saddle. But his co-star's intensity _ Judy Davis only gives bad
performances in Woody Allen movies _ was a one-person exercise of a
poet's definition of purity of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Bates also got some notable actors to show up and take smaller
parts, such as David Paymer, Bebe Newirth _ who gets accolades just
for being a far less irritating Dorothy Parker than the squawking
Jennifer Jason Leigh in ``Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle'' _
and interestingly, Laurence Luckinbill, who has aged into what
looks like a brick building.
</P>
<P>
   An equally odd choice was the film selected to pay tribute to
gifted composer Elmer Bernstein, ``National Lampoon's Animal
House.'' The score for that movie is so serious that it almost
doesn't quite realize if it's in on the joke, or is the butt of
one.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Animal House'' does represent a turning point in
Bernstein's career. Director John Landis pulled Bernstein out of a
self-imposed semi-retirement to write and conduct the musical
accompaniment. And it was great to see the movie, which turned 20
last year, with a nearly full house and be reminded that its humor
still plays. (Even with the bunch that sat behind me, who weren't
old to enough to have seen its original run and had caught the
cleaned-up version ``on TNT, or somethin'.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Great Director Tribute to Arthur Penn didn't include one of
my favorites: ``The Left-Handed Gun,'' with Paul Newman as an
itchy, half-sane Billy the Kid. That film still has power, though
Penn disowned it after the studio, afraid of the adult overtones,
recut the picture. It did include Penn's crowning work, ``Bonnie
and Clyde,'' which had a troubled release in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   It basically flopped, but star and producer Warren Beatty
browbeat the studio over the course of a year into re-releasing the
picture and giving it a better send-off. (The studio, Warner Bros.,
was the same pack of oafs who didn't get ``The Left-Handed Gun.'')
The under-seen 1971 revisionist western ``Little Big Man,'' which
has aged well, was also shown, as was the failed 1975 film noir
``Night Moves,'' which has not aged so well, despite the retro
revival of runway-sized jacket lapels, leather blazers and
checkered pants.
</P>
<P>
   The Short Film Winners program was a weird row of ducks, too.
The Grand Prize winner was the beautifully realized animated
Claymation piece ``More.'' Though ``More'' deserves to win any
place it plays, it was also an Oscar nominee for Best Animated
Short this year, so any other worthy film could've served in its
place.
</P>
<P>
   I'm loath to single out film festival jury selections, since
I've served on so many in the past year that the next time I'm
asked, I think I'll claim I'm doing actual jury duty just to get
out of it. (In the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit it
was my pleasure to be on last year's USA Festival jury.)
</P>
<P>
   But there were a lot of portentous black and white films chosen,
including the winner of the experimental film category, ``My
Turn.'' (Which may have been called experimental because its
credits were so hard to read _ in fact, that must've been the only
reason, since it looked like a narrative film.)
</P>
<P>
   And also partially in black and white was a Fellini-inspired
piece _ if ``inspired'' is the word one would use on this horror _
that included a silent clown. A mime! In a short! And it still won
a prize! Imagine what the losers must've been like.
</P>
<P>
   I was told the judges sat through all the films in their
entirety, which sounded like quite an achievement. Until one of the
jurors was overheard saying they did so only because they couldn't
agree on anything. Immediately, the choice of ``Animal House''
didn't seem so bad after all.

FINANCE GURU PRACTICES WHAT SHE PREACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The reigning shaman and high priestess of
personal finance may be a famous author, a television personality
and a millionaire, but she's still one of us. Yes, Suze Orman has
the common touch and a modest lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Orman, 47, drives an old BMW and lives in a small Oakland hills
home she bought when she was a waitress at the Buttercup Bakery in
Berkeley 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She loves down-home diners and cheap fast-food chains. Her
favorite meal: a diet Coke and Taco Bell tacos with hot sauce.
</P>
<P>
   She dresses casually, often wearing a black sweater, dark slacks
and simple jewelry. Her one extravagance: a $14,000 Cartier watch.
</P>
<P>
   No, her friends and colleagues insist, the down-to-earth act
isn't a marketing ploy. It's real Suze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a shtick, and it's not fake,'' said Richard Aulette,
the New York publicist for Orman. ``I've worked with a lot of
celebrities over the years, and she's very real. You won't see her
jumping into limousines.''
</P>
<P>
   Fame apparently hasn't spoiled Orman, writer of three
bestsellers, a frequent guest of Oprah Winfrey and a fund-raiser
par excellence for PBS stations.
</P>
<P>
   The working-class daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants in
Chicago, Orman trucked to California with a bunch of friends in a
Ford Econoline van in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   After toiling as a waitress, she got a job as a stockbroker at
Merrill Lynch in Oakland, where she became a top producer. Then she
jumped to Prudential Bache as a vice president, selling insurance
annuities. Orman soon opened her own office as a financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Orman's first book, ``You've Earned It, Don't
Lose It,'' sold a half-million in hard cover. Her next, ``The 9
Steps to Financial Freedom,'' sold 2 million in hard cover and
topped the New York Times bestseller list for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Orman's new book, ``The Courage to Be Rich: Creating a Life of
Material and Spiritual Abundance,'' is another blockbuster. Since
its debut seven weeks ago, it has already sold nearly 1 million
copies and risen to No. 1 on the New York Times list.
</P>
<P>
   Money gurus come and go. So what's her appeal?
</P>
<P>
   One friend, movie producer Linda Gottlieb, said Orman's success
comes in three parts: She was born with natural charisma and a
dynamic personality. She's sincere and generous _ almost to a fault
_ with her time and money. And she has tapped into the psyche of
the '90s by infusing financial topics with the yearning for
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brings an evangelical fervor to money _ she's genuinely
spiritual and she's genuinely financial,'' Gottlieb said. ``It's
totally in tune with the times. Spiritual gurus are out of touch
with the practical life, and financial gurus don't address people's
emotions and spiritual needs. Suze does both.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb, who produced ``Dirty Dancing'' and helped Orman hone
her television image, said her friend ``puts her money where her
mouth is. She really cares.''
</P>
<P>
   An altruist even when she was poor, Orman said she typically
donates 25 percent of her yearly income _ ``several million
dollars'' _ to charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the wealthy have big-time moral obligations,'' Orman
said. ``It's sad that those who make a lot of money don't give as
much as they can. They're missing out on the incredible joy behind
money, the real gift in making money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have blasted her work. Too touchy-feely, too New
Age-y, they charge. The Wall Street Journal's personal finance
columnist, Jonathan Clements, wrote: ``How awful is Ms. Orman's
(latest) book? I can think of much better ways to spend $24.95.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Forbes magazine attacked Orman for allegedly
inflating her resume and financial credentials. Among other
allegations, Forbes said Orman worked only seven years at Wall
Street firms _ not 18 years, as claimed on her PBS video.
</P>
<P>
   Orman said the PBS publicity material should have read that she
worked 18 years ``with'' financial institutions _ seven years as an
employee and 11 years as an independent financial adviser. She said
a copywriter mistakenly changed the wording.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism slides off Orman's back like water off a dolphin.
What counts is her readers and viewers, she said, and how she can
help them improve their finances and their lives.

 &HT;    SPY SCANDAL DARKENING CONGRESS'S VIEW OF CHINA
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's ``strategic
partnership'' with China is threatening to fray at the seams as
Congress digests reports of the decades-long Chinese effort to
steal U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear scandal is just the main ingredient in a bitter stew
heating up on Capitol Hill. Soon the lawmakers will begin their
annual debate on China's trade status, sure to be filled with harsh
rhetoric on human rights and swelling imports.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming up are a pair of inflammatory anniversaries _ June
4, which marks 10 years since the Chinese government's massacre of
pro-democracy students at Tiananmen Square, and Oct. 1, the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the communist government.
</P>
<P>
   But for Congress members, the burgeoning allegations of spying
at U.S. nuclear weapons labs raise the greatest doubts about the
two nations' relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The reports mark ``a low point of Sino-American relations''
since they were restored by President Nixon in the early 1970s,
said Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., chairman of the Pacific
subcommittee of the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of a congressional
committee that is investigating the alleged thefts, has said that
China stole ``the crown jewels of our nuclear arsenal'' during the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the most recent spying disclosures, some Republican
leaders had come to regard China as potentially the most dangerous
U.S. adversary _ a rival increasingly capable of striking the
United States with ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the GOP leadership in Congress and most of the party's
candidates for president are calling for national security to be a
larger component of the complex U.S.-China relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate focus of the president and Congress must be the
recognition that the United States may now be at significantly
greater risk from a Chinese ballistic missile attack,'' Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, recently wrote in The Washington Post. ``This
recognition must inform the continuing debate about the efficacy of
a strategic partnership with China.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugar's conclusions, which are hardly confined to his own
political party, are rooted in the sobering assessment lawmakers
received from government investigators last month: ``China obtained
U.S. nuclear weapons information that probably accelerated its
program to develop future nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has denied that assessment. ``It is not
the policy of China to steal so-called 'military secrets' from the
United States,'' Chinese Premier Zhu Rongui asserted during his
visit to the United States last month.
</P>
<P>
   But a 25-page report to top U.S. officials recently warned that
China ``represents an acute intelligence threat'' to the Department
of Energy, which manages the nation's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The report, disclosed Sunday by The New York Times, said China
conducts ``a full court press'' in its espionage efforts, using
``massive numbers of collectors of all kinds'' to obtain
information.
</P>
<P>
   One such collector, according to the FBI, was Wen Ho Lee, a
Taiwan-born and U.S.-educated computer scientist at the 43-acre Los
Alamos National Laboratory in the New Mexico desert, the secretive
scientific community that developed the world's first atomic bomb
in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 59, was fired after failing an FBI polygraph test in March,
just months away from a planned retirement. The FBI has had
insufficient evidence to arrest him. Through an attorney, Lee has
denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson confirmed last week that
reams of top secret nuclear weapons software and data from
classified computers had been found by FBI agents on an
unclassified computer used by Lee. The transfers occurred between
1983 and 1995, but accelerated in 1994 and 1995 when Los Alamos
began installing a new system designed to impede such computer
piracy, according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Lee came to the FBI's attention after U.S. intelligence
officials determined in 1995 that seven years earlier, the Chinese
had acquired schematic drawings for light, miniaturized nuclear
warheads known as W-88s. Lee worked on a team developing triggers
for the W-88 warhead, America's most advanced weapon.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. counterintelligence agencies took notice of Lee as early as
1982, when the FBI intercepted a telephone call the scientist
placed to a known espionage suspect who had worked at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California. The Livermore
scientist had resigned amid accusations that he had provided China
with neutron bomb secrets, but was never charged.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's critics in Congress have complained that the
administration was too slow in removing a scientist believed to
have stolen U.S. nuclear warhead secrets for China. Current and
former Energy Department officials have given congressional
committees conflicting testimony about whether breaches of security
were ignored or ``minimized'' for political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., in a recent letter asking for
Senate hearings on the Los Alamos spy case, said, ``I believe this
incident is symptomatic of the casual attitude with which the
Clinton administration views issues of national security.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has conceded that the FBI may have been
slow in acting against Lee, in part because his wife, Sylvia, a
former secretary at the lab, was an ``informational asset'' for the
FBI from 1985 to 1991 when her duties involved arranging tours for
visiting Chinese delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked for an independent investigation headed by
former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., to assess the administration's
handling of the Lee inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The president, reflecting the evolving political nature of a spy
case coming on the heels of allegations that his 1996 re-election
campaign received illegal campaign contributions from China, has
also noted that espionage began during the Reagan administration
and continued through the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Lee was actually promoted to a better job at the
lab in 1997 has prompted GOP presidential candidates to accuse the
president, and by extension, Vice President Al Gore, the
front-runner for the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination, of
incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   One, Pat Buchanan, even called the Lee case ``the worst breach
of national security'' since the famed espionage case of Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed in 1953 for selling nuclear
secrets to the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans are trying to cool their party's rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't overreact here, and I say this directly to my
party,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. ``You can't hold these
issues hostage to partisan games and political leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with China, ``I think it's important to understand we
need to emphasize friendship,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla.,
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The same message may be coming from the business community,
which has begun organizing to lobby Congress to loosen export
restrictions on high technology to China. The country is expected
to be the second-largest computer market in the world next year.
</P>
<P>
   A group of computer companies, including IBM, Intel, Sun
Microsystems and Unisys, have formed the Computer Coalition for
Responsible Exports in response to the congressional criticism of
China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also urged a balanced view in a speech to the U.S.
Institute of Peace on the eve of Zhu's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we should not look at China through rose-colored
glasses, nor should we look through a glass darkly to see an image
that distorts China's strength and ignores its complexities,'' he
said. ``We need to see China clearly _ its progress and its
problems, its system and its strains, its policies and its
perception of us, of itself, of the world.''

ANCHOVIES FROM THE SEA, NOT FROM THE CAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: recipes at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fresh tuna? Of course. And fresh sardines? They, too,
are showing up in markets and menus. Both fish no longer come just
in cans.
</P>
<P>
   Anchovies are next.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you love anchovies or hate them, that they could be
something other than dark, salty, oily little canned strips of
fish, either flat or rolled around a caper, might come as a
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   When freshly scooped from the sea, anchovies are bright-eyed
silver darts that resemble small sardines. Once they have been
deboned and gutted, they can be cooked fresh, but more often, the
fillets are marinated in lemon juice, vinegar and salt and pepper
from six hours to several days. Then, they can be dressed with a
little extra-virgin olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   The marination turns the gray flesh to an opaque white, which is
why they are called white anchovies, and they acquire a taste that
suggests pickled herring.
</P>
<P>
   Though typically a Mediterranean ingredient, white anchovies are
showing up on all sorts of menus, in a salad at the ``21'' Club and
on cold mashed potatoes at the new Red Cat in Chelsea. Michel
Nischan, the chef at Heartbeat in the W Hotel, uses white anchovies
instead of canned ones in his salade nicoise because of their
milder flavor.
</P>
<P>
   A number of chefs, including Francesco Antonucci at Remi,
Stephen Kalt of Spartina and Spazzia, Alessandro Giuntoli of
Osteria del Circo, Mario Batali of Babbo, Joey Fortunato of
Scarabee and Stefano Battistini of Fresco, buy fresh, uncured
anchovies and do their own marinating.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they usually array the silvery ribbons of fish around a
tangle of baby greens or over a mound of potato salad.
Occasionally, they lightly cook them in a pasta dish or use them to
garnish roasted fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main point is to keep the recipe simple,'' said Nicola
Marzovilla, the owner of I Trulli, where the anchovies are served
in a salad with oranges. ``When they're fresh and freshly
marinated, you don't have to do much with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anchovies are caught in the Atlantic, off the coasts of
Portugal, Spain and Morocco, and throughout the Mediterranean.
Unmarinated fresh anchovies are sometimes breaded and fried to
serve at once. At Les Halles, Jose de Meirelles marinates fried
anchovies and turns them into an escabeche. In Turkey, where they
are very popular, they are served baked in a rice pilaf.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh anchovies, seasonal in spring, are currently coming from
Agadir, Morocco, and are available in a number of fish markets.
When buying fresh anchovies to marinate, it's best to select large
ones, no more than 24 to 30 a pound. They will be meatier and
easier to clean.
</P>
<P>
   The anchovies are available at Wild Edibles, 255 Elizabeth St.
(Prince Street) for $3.95 a pound; Tan My My, 249-53 Grand St.
(Chrystie Street), $2 a pound, and Randazzo's Seafood, 2327 Arthur
Ave. (187th Street), the Bronx, $4.99 a pound. They can be ordered
from Sea Breeze, 541 Ninth Ave. (40th Street) and should be
available in a few weeks at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas
(Ninth Street).
</P>
<P>
   Fancy-food shops and fish markets sell them already marinated,
imported from Italy or from Spain, where they are called boquerones
and are a popular tapas item. At Eli's Manhattan, 1141 Third Ave.
(80th Street), marinated anchovies are $12 a pound, and at Dean &AMP;
DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street), they are $20 a pound. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cheap cigars stink but well-made cigars have an
elegant bouquet that people adore,'' said Marvin Shanken, as he
lighted his Havana-made Hoyo de Monterrey Double Corona, a 7
5/8-inch specimen that cost about $15. ``This is rich and spicy,
with notes of cherry and licorice.'' As the smoke billowed through
his office, he caught sight of his visitor's reaction. Abruptly, he
stubbed the thing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cigar smokers are very sensitive about who might be
offended,'' he said, ``especially when we're smoking in a closed
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitor got all choked up.
</P>
<P>
   Shanken, the contrarian editor and publisher of the glossy
magazine Cigar Aficionado, is perhaps the planet's leading promoter
of the cigar and an indignant defender of that hounded,
misunderstood minority, cigar smokers. At the National Magazine
Awards ceremony last week, at which Shanken was a surprise winner
for his magazine's Web site, he remarked, ``In this era of
political correctness, we at Cigar Aficionado are humbled by this
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Humility is not often associated with Shanken, 55, who is happy
to take two fistfuls of credit for the cigar boom of the '90s.
Shanken, owner of Wine Spectator and other good taste journals, is
a canny entrepreneur. He sponsors seminars for food and wine
executives, as well as bonanza sampler events for thousands of
would-be wine and cigar connoisseurs, like the annual Big Smoke in
Manhattan on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   One could assume that this authority on what he dubs ``pieces of
the good life puzzle'' might be as sleekly elegant as the
celebrities who grace the covers of Cigar Aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   But here's Marvin: ragged beard, gimmicky suspenders, a paunch
and a Swatch watch. And a sizable, self-congratulatory grin. ``The
good life is getting better and better,'' said the man who has made
a fortune selling the idea. ``The opportunities for rewarding
yourself have never been better.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanken's background seems to contain few hints that he would
one day become an avatar of tastefulness. By his account, his
upbringing by a New Haven, Conn., jewelry and appliance store owner
and his wife, an occasional painter, was unremarkable, the cuisine
``strictly Bird's-Eye frozen chicken potpies.'' At the University
of Miami, he majored in business and graduated at the bottom of his
class. But Miami was also where he discovered cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were Havatampa Jewels, five for a quarter, with wooden
tips,'' he said sheepishly. ``I smoked them in a cute way, not a
serious way.''
</P>
<P>
   With an M.B.A., he started as an investment banker, specializing
in real estate. A deal with a California vineyard cinched it:
already a budding enophile, he would marry profession and passion
and become a wine journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he bought Wine Spectator, then a thin newspaper. He
turned it into a fat, sassy must-read that seized on complementary
life-style subjects like food and travel. In 1992, he indulged his
other great passion and published his go-for-broke toy, Cigar
Aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   The debut issue was criticized for its limited appeal, a salute
to a noxious fetish that can cause cancer. (``Well, a cigar isn't
yogurt or grapefruit,'' Shanken said.) Seven years later, Cigar
Aficionado, published every other month, claims an average
circulation of about 320,000. Its June issue on Cuba calls for
normalizing relations with the United States, with thumbs-up,
thumbs-down articles by, respectively, Senators Christopher J. Dodd
and Jesse Helms. Its Web site has had eight million hits since its
founding. Cigar bars are ubiquitous and cigar smokers have taken
their rightful if smelly place in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Among Shanken's good life rewards are a floor-to-ceiling wine
cellar in his office stocked with 200-year-old vintages as well as
a walk-in humidor in his conference room, and the smaller ones on
display, like the 1961 walnut beauty given by Milton Berle to John
F. Kennedy, which Shanken bought for $575,000. (He also bought the
apartment across the hall from his Upper East Side home, where
Hazel, his refined stockbroker wife, permits him to smoke cigars.)
</P>
<P>
   Shanken is admired and even envied by many in the publishing
world. ``His magazines say `yes' in an age of `no,''' said Dorothy
Kalins, the editor in chief of Saveur and Garden Design. Steven
Florio, the president and chief executive officer of Conde Nast
Publications, said, ``His skill, his mind is totally elegant, even
though his suit is rumpled.''
</P>
<P>
   Dining companions say Shanken is a charming raconteur who
unleashes his formidable knowledge only when he deems necessary. At
a dinner several years ago, the host, Gene Pressman of Barney's,
presented the wine, a 1961 Petrus, with an oration about its
provenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvin stood up and said, `I agree this is a world-class
wine,''' recalled Carl Portale, the publisher of Elle magazine,
``but I must tell you, this is not the right kind of glass to pour
it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends who have smoked and sipped with him say Shanken
demystifies wine and cigars even as he venerates them. Phil
Guarascio, a vice president of General Motors, remembered ordering
a Fume Blanc at a fine Detroit restaurant. The wine seemed too
rich, too golden to him. ``So I asked Marvin, who has this famous
nose, to taste it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanken took a sip. Then, said Guarascio, laughing, ``Marvin
said: `I dunno. Why don't we ask for the bottle and look at the
label?'''

YIN AND YANG LITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last two years, there has been a growing genre of books
on food as medicine. Some tell you the health-giving properties of
familiar foods. Others encourage you to make curative tonics,
otherwise known as soups.
</P>
<P>
   They are refreshing in that they encourage readers to look at
eating as nourishing and healthful. But too many of them cross the
line from offering a sensible change of perspective to arguing that
food can transform your health. Orange and fennel salad may contain
phytochemicals and be good for you, but it isn't going to change
your life.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Simonds' latest book, ``A Spoonful of Ginger'' (Knopf,
$30), walks that line with perfect ease. Ms. Simonds, an author of
several books on Chinese cooking, takes holistic philosophies of
eating that she learned as a student in Asia and adapts them to
Western life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian holistic approach does not preach denial or impose a
rigid diet,'' she writes, ``but, rather, stresses a common-sense,
relaxed approach to eating in which balance is key.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simonds bases her claims on a philosophy that has existed
for millenniums. And yet she is careful to point out that the
recipes are ``health giving,'' not ``therapeutic.'' It is an
important distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction defines characteristics of yin and yang body
types and gives descriptions of the foods believed in Chinese
culture to correspond with each season _ cleansing foods like
lentils, barley, shiitake mushrooms and bean sprouts correspond
with the spring, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Chapters are divided fairly typically: soups, seafood,
vegetables and rice, breads and noodles. Essays at the beginning of
each introduce you to practitioners of Chinese medicine and
holistic cooking. The chapters on tong shui, or sweet soups, and
herbal tonics, are the most daring, and in a way the most
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh mangoes and silver tree ears in syrup, for instance, is
unusual. Silver tree ears, a dried plant, are believed to improve
complexion; mangoes, to quench thirst and aid digestion. She also
includes tonics like lotus root cooler and a formula for hangovers
made with pueraria flowers.
</P>
<P>
   If you suspect you should begin preparing for a trip to a good
Asian herbal store, this is generally not necessary. There is a
purity about the recipes, many of which are designed to highlight
just one or two ingredients. Flavors are intense and clear.
</P>
<P>
   A chicken soup with ginger was interesting in technique and
taste. Lightly blanched chicken parts are combined with scallions,
ginger, water and rice wine, covered tightly and steamed in a water
bath. With all the aromas trapped in the pot, the soup becomes a
clear, intense broth. As you sip it, the word ``tonic'' does
actually come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   CLEAR-STEAMED CHICKEN SOUP WITH GINGER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From ``A Spoonful of Ginger'' by Nina Simonds &QL;
</P>
<P>

`HUMAN VOICES': AUDITIONS FOR HUNGRY MUSES AT THE HOUSE OF TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Adverbs,'' Umberto Eco replied when someone asked him what
``The Name of the Rose'' was really about. More significant than
his story and characters is the drift of voice in which they eddy.
In the same way you might say that Penelope Fitzgerald's novels are
about subordinate clauses. A leading action, a statement, a mood
are yanked from below like a fishing float and dart zigzag away.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in ``Human Voices,'' Vi Simmons, employed in
wartime London, brings a fellow worker to stay in her mother's
house, from which a previous roommate had upsettingly decamped.
``Mrs. Simmons, who was generous enough not to learn from
experience, welcomed a new lodger,'' the author writes.
</P>
<P>
   Between those two subordinating commas a large character has
mushroomed. Ms. Fitzgerald writes characters dramatically, as if
they were actions. Then, beneath character and action, she writes
possibility: the world is such and such a way, but it may be other
ways as well. Mrs. Simmons' dependent clause is one of a number of
apparent asides pervading ``Human Voices'' and giving it both scope
and lilt.
</P>
<P>
   Using the gaiety and unexpected gravity of such asides, Ms.
Fitzgerald, who is past 80, has been writing fiction for only the
last 20 years. Almost by stealth her eight novels have grown
steadily in assurance and dimension, from ``The Bookshop'' and
``Offshore,'' which won the Booker Prize, to four culminating works
_ ``Innocence,'' ``The Beginning of Spring,'' ``Gate of Angels''
and ``The Blue Flower'' _ which deserved it more.
</P>
<P>
   The most European and least insular of contemporary British
novelists, and to my mind the finest, Ms. Fitzgerald works an airy
continuum between what you might figuratively call gastronomy and
eating. ``The Blue Flower,'' a seriocomic evocation of the German
Romantic movement, begins with a great quantity of laundry. Here in
``Human Voices'' notions of truth and mortality meld with a
wonderful passage about piano tuning. Ms. Fitzgerald's writing is
earthy at its most elevated and a trampoline at its most down to
earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voices,'' an early novel published in this country for the
first time, is bumpy in places. It concludes with what feels like a
sketch of an ending; romantic and dramatic but not really worked
out. Several characters assemble some promising contradictions and
paradoxes, but the writer has not figured how to put them together.
Yet in its best moments, and there are quite a few, there is
outrageous pleasure coupled with an occasional disconcerting free
fall: Ms. Fitzgerald's specialty.
</P>
<P>
   The novel takes place at the British Broadcasting Corp. during
World War II. The BBC played a signal role in holding the British
together when there seemed little else in the early years of
blitzkrieg and retreat that could have. Ms. Fitzgerald, too old to
have jettisoned reverence from her peddler's pack of contradictions
_ tenderness, a cold eye, comedy and grief _ interjects what she
believes the place stood for:
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadcasting House was in fact dedicated to the strangest
project of the war, or of any war, that is, telling the truth.
Without prompting, the BBC had decided that truth was more
important than consolation and, in the long run, would be more
effective. And yet there was no guarantee of this. Truth insures
trust, but not victory.''
</P>
<P>
   A stage setting of some dignity, then, for a comedy too pure to
have the slightest use for any. Ms. Fitzgerald's novels are never
far from the stage. (Even when they think or talk to themselves,
her characters perform.) There is a hint of Aristotelian unities in
her use of an office world as the world. If ``Voices'' is theater,
though, it is somewhere between music hall and traditional English
pantomime. What is being performed is a version of St. George and
the Dragon; here the princess rescues the dragon, and George
perishes by accident.
</P>
<P>
   The dragon first: Sam Brooks, the mission-besotted director of
recorded programming. He spends two weeks in the country for
something to be called ``Lest We Forget Our Englishry.'' To his
superiors' horror the records are nothing but squeaks and creaks.
Englishry, Sam had decided, could nowhere be more truly expressed
than by a harvest festival at a rural church. In his aural purism
this was to be registered exclusively by the sound of the Hither
Lickington church door opening and closing as parishioners trundled
in their vegetable offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Sam is the artist as middle-aged child; his fellow workers are
protective as well as dismayed, even when his oddity assumes a more
awkward aspect. An artist needs a muse, Sam figures, and he seeks a
succession of them: young female interns whose hiring he personally
supervises.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to depart as quickly as they arrive, owing to his
habit of summoning them to his office for a late sandwich, a tender
ear for his sorrows and a little hand squeezing. Not much more _
although it is a while before we are sure _ but enough to
constitute what we plainly recognize as harassment and what Ms.
Fitzgerald, interested in inner motions and history's relativities,
frames in a way that is subtler and, oddly, more rigorous.
</P>
<P>
   The novel takes in other territory: the foggily surreal office
politics of an organization that has no idea how to be one, London
in the war, the much-needed reassurance the city gets from an
ebullient American broadcaster, as well as various awkwardly
unfocused subplots and sub-characters. The conversion of Sam is its
heart, though. Human voices wake him from records and avuncular
solipsism. Contrary to the T.S. Eliot line of the title, instead of
drowning, he manages birth.
</P>
<P>
   The voices belong to two other first-rate characters. One is a
cynical and self-indulgent colleague of Sam's who does quite a bit
of good in spite of himself before coming to a near-comic end, a
suddenly ill-fated St. George. The other, Annie, is the last of the
interns.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter of a piano tuner _ the piano tuning is transcendental
and splendidly particular; the laboriousness of real music versus
the surrogate ease of Sam's records _ she withers her boss with her
highly original independence. She also falls in love but conceals
it, harsh on herself as well as him. Harshly, princess frees
dragon; for love, among other things. As storytelling, the ending
is patly contrived. Ms. Fitzgerald would come to them better. As
moral to her witty, earth-attached and buoyant fable, it works
fine.

<P>
   MAINE-ICE-STORM. The Housing and Urban Development Department on
Tuesday announced it will give Maine another $17.1 million to
offset the cost of repairing the state's utility grid after last
year's vicious ice storms, an eight-fold increase over the agency's
original grant to the state. But HUD officials said they will only
release the additional funds if Congress abandons a plan to shift

Badger Care. But the American Heart Association said the federal

 &HT;    AMERICAN POWS 'PHYSICALLY' FIT TO MEET THE PRESIDENT, WILL
UNDERGO FURTHER PSYCH EXAMS, DEBRIEFING
 &HT;    EDs: Contains optional trim.
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-CLINTON-0505.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDSTUHL, Germany _ The three U.S. servicemen held for more
than a month as POWs in Yugoslavia are physically fit enough to be
released from an American military hospital, doctors said Tuesday,
in time for a scheduled meeting with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Military doctors examining the three soldiers since they were
freed from Yugoslavia on Sunday said they require no further
treatment for injuries, including broken bones, chipped teeth and
skin abrasions, they received during their capture by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   The servicemen will remain in the hospital to undergo more
psychological evaluations and for further debriefing about their
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials continued to refuse to discuss the circumstances
of the ambush by Serb forces as the Americans patrolled the border
area of Yugoslavia and Macedonia on March 31 on a peacekeeping
mission. Details will be disclosed when the Army's investigation is
completed, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said Monday that the
initial debriefings have reaffirmed U.S. officials' belief that the
soldiers were captured inside Macedonia. Serb authorities have
claimed the three were in Serb territory when captured.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers -- Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles;
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and
Spec. Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas -- have not spoken
to reporters since they arrived at Landstuhl Regional Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctors and nurses who have been attending them revealed
details of their imprisonment during a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The soldiers were forced to wear hoods and were constantly
shackled in the first days following their capture, and later each
was held in solitary confinement in a windowless cell. The result
was disorientation; all told the doctors they lost track of night
and day, and how long they had been held.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Their injuries, chipped teeth, bruises and abrasions to all
and a broken nose suffered by Stone and two broken ribs for
Ramirez, were sustained during their capture or in the first week
of their imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They were fed a sparse diet mainly of soups and bread. All
lost weight, including Stone who dropped 14 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gonzalez received intravenous fluids from the Yugoslavian
authorities during his incarceration. He told doctors he did not
know what was in the IV drip or why it had been given to him,
except that he had been feeling weak at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers and their families will meet with Clinton during
the president's tour Wednesday and Thursday of two U.S. air bases
and a Kosovo refugee center in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the 1st Infantry Division, in which the
soldiers serve, is scheduled to present them with commendations in
a ceremony Thursday for their bravery, and endurance during the
capture and incarceration. The Army trains soldiers to deal with
the potential of capture during wartime.
</P>
<P>
   The course, called ``Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape,''
educates troops on techniques to avoid capture, or withstand long
and potentially brutal incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have preferred a better outcome of the 'resistance'
part,'' said Col. Michael Sullivan, spokesman for U.S. Army in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The families of Stone and Ramirez met with reporters Wednesday
for the first time since being reunited with the soldiers in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   They said the families and the soldiers were both elated by the
reunion and emotionally exhausted after the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's family said he told them that his survival and safe
release from captivity was a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Chris is a believer in miracles now. I think he
realizes that life is short and there are things you need to
straighten out,'' said Stone's sister Dawn Relliford.
</P>
<P>
   Both families said that little was spoken during their initial
reunion on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't even explain the feelings that you have,'' said
Stone's second sister, Deanna. ``You don't even want to talk. You
want to see them and give them a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Ramirez said she hugged her son so hard that ``I had to
let him go so he could breathe.''

 &HT;    Newman tackles the bite of real life
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a decade sequestered in a production studio scoring films
_ and racking up an astonishing three Oscar nominations in 1999 for
``Pleasantville,'' ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City'' _
singer/songwriter Randy Newman is back at the piano singing about
the absurdities and ironies of real life.
</P>
<P>
   His new CD, ``Bad Love,'' due June 1, is a quirky collection of
classic Newman vignettes about people and the peculiarities of
living in the '90s. It's the same unmistakable New Orleans piano
sound as classic albums such as ``Sail Away'' or ``Rednecks,'' from
sweet love tunes to biting musical commentaries.
</P>
<P>
   On his first non-film CD since 1988, Newman is a crotchety,
graying baby boomer who sings about watching too much TV, rich
older men married to sweet young thangs and aging rock stars who
won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   The new CD comes on the heels of the release of Newman's boxed
set, ``Guilty: 30 Years of Randy Newman,'' which spans his entire
career, including songs he wrote for others (``Mama Told Me Not to
Come,'' ``You Can Leave Your Hat On'') and his own hits (``Short
People,'' ``I Love L.A.'').
</P>
<P>
   His appearance tonight at Variety Playhouse is one of only 15
dates Newman is doing in the United States this year. We caught up
with him at his home in (where else) Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the new album, you have a song called ``I'm Dead'' which
is a pretty nasty comment on old rock stars. What, or who, inspired
that tune?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I'm Dead'' wasn't really about one person, it's more
generational. There's a mass of us over 50 that are still hacking
away out there. People who said 20 years ago they would never do
this when they got old are refusing to leave the stage. There's
this giant, demographic glob of baby boomers who, until we pass on,
are going to gum up the works for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have a very distinct accent when you sing, kind of a New
Orleans dialect, yet you don't have it when you speak. Is the
singing voice an affectation, or did it come naturally?
</P>
<P>
   A: My mother was from New Orleans, and she never lost her
accent. My brother has none. I didn't really affect it. I've
questioned it in my mind many a time, but I think when I first sang
it sounded better to me, and so that's what I did. I don't know if
somebody like Elton John affects his sound, or if it just sounded
better that way. I loved Ray Charles, Fats Domino, so that may have
had something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You always weave social commentary into your songs. What's
different about these new ones than songs you wrote 20 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think there's the hope now that there was that things
might change, like with racism. I'm sure some places in Atlanta
have changed, but I bet there's probably still a North side and a
South side. There was attention focused in the '60s. It's still an
enormous problem, but not much attention is being paid to it
anymore. Also, I was writing some of these songs from the
standpoint of an idea that appeals enormously to me, which is
someone being a CEO of the company, he has everything in the world,
and things can still rise up and smack you _ your kid's not doing
well in school, you have to listen to some 20-something blather on
about their job. You're never free of something reaching up out of
life and grabbing you by the throat.

   DODGER-STADIUM _ What have the Los Angeles Dodgers learned about
a possible move to a new stadium in Exposition Park? Nothing that
would lead them to believe it may become reality, Dodger President
Bob Graziano said in an interview. ``My sense is that it's going
nowhere at this point,'' he said. ``It was an idea born of the

   COXNET WHEELS 0423 _ Although only 30 years old, the Pontiac
Firebird Trans Am is absolutely antediluvian. In fact, it's
wonderfully primitive, in other words, intended to appeal to
enthusiasts in their 30s and 40s who have the means to make their
old memories come alive. (DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   NET-HEALTHCARE _ ADAM Internet Health has landed several deals

propel it to the front of the pack in Net healthcare information.
The deals, including one with NetCenter, compare favorably to

   FRAUD-FINE _ Peter Tostos, who ran a number of shaky companies

   DELL-EXPANSION _ AUSTIN, Texas _ A proposal to give Dell
Computer Corp. local sales tax dollars it would generate if the
company locates in Nashville has been yanked off the table. But the
state is still negotiating with Dell to build a facility in
southeast Davidson County, creating at least 3,000 jobs over five
years. Dell gets a portion of every dollar that the city where it's
headquartered, Round Rock, Texas, receives from the sale of the
company's computers in Texas. The company wanted the same kind of
deal to expand in Tennessee, but state officials said it would be
illegal. (Mahoney, Austin American-Statesman)

company locates in Nashville has been yanked off the table. But the
state is still negotiating with Dell to build a facility in
southeast Davidson County, creating at least 3,000 jobs over five
years. Dell gets a portion of every dollar that the city where it's
headquartered, Round Rock, Texas, receives from the sale of the
company's computers in Texas. The company wanted the same kind of
deal to expand in Tennessee, but state officials said it would be
illegal. (Mahoney, Austin American-Statesman)

CALIF. ASSEMBLY SPEAKER SAYS GORE HAS TOUGH FIGHT AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic leader of California's lower house
predicted Tuesday that Vice President Al Gore will win heavy
support in the state, but he said competition from former Sen. Bill
Bradley will make him ``work hard'' for the Democratic nomination
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   California Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa told reporters
in a luncheon meeting here, ``I believe Al Gore is going to be the
Democratic nominee and ... the next president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in his forecast for Gore, Villaraigosa said
Bradley's presidential bid ``is going to make you work hard. You're
going to have a race ... It's a good thing to have a primary
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley challenge will make Gore a better candidate in the
general election, Villaraigosa said, adding. ``When you go through
fire, it makes you tougher.'' He predicted that a Gore-Bradley race
would give the vice president ``an opportunity to show his vision,
to show he has a breadth of support ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Villaraigosa, 46, Assembly speaker since February 1998, is
expected to endorse Gore along with most of the Assembly's
47-member Democratic Caucus in a meeting here Wednesday with the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsements will come at a critical time for Gore, who has
had trouble building enthusiasm among Democrats who say he is too
bland a candidate to beat the leading GOP contender, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bradley has been energized by Gore's poor
showing in polls pitting him against Bush. Since February many
polls have showed Gore 10 to 21 percentage points behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But a CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll Tuesday showed Gore widening the
gap with Bradley and narrowing it with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey Gore beat Bradley 66 percent to 23 percent among
respondents. The same poll on April 14 showed Gore with 54 percent
and Bradley with 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the poll showed Bush ahead of Gore 56 percent to 40
percent, a 16-point margin. On April 14, Bush led Gore by 21 points
_ 59 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With its massive 54 electoral votes, California is the prize of
the West. Political experts say no Democrat can hope to win the
White House without carrying the state.
</P>
<P>
   Villaraigosa dismissed the polls as insignificant this far in
advance of Election Day, citing President George Bush's high
standing in 1991 after the Persian Gulf War and his ultimate loss
to then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, (Gore is) down in the polls right now, but I don't think
it's any indication of where he's going to end up,'' Villaraigosa
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly speaker acknowledged that Bush is a ``strong
nominee,'' especially because of his strength among Hispanic voters
_ a key Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are ``excited about a George Bush because they think
he can cross over (and) penetrate the Latino vote,'' he said,
pointing out that it is critical not only in California and Texas,
but in other key states such as New York, Illinois, Florida and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Bush may prove vulnerable among Hispanics because
of his undefined views on divisive civil rights issues such as
Proposition 209, the 1996 ballot California ballot initiative that
banned affirmative action in state and local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's initially going to look attractive (to
Hispanics), but when we start getting beyond the surface, it's
going to be more difficult. (But) there's no question he's going to
be a formidable candidate.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another bevy of severe thunderstorms will develop across the
region from the lower Ohio Valley to the central Gulf Coast states
on Wednesday as the weather pattern across the Middle West remains
rather volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Very humid air streaming inland from the Gulf of Mexico
initially will be prevented from rising high into the atmosphere by
a lid of warm air near 5,000 feet, allowing a powder-keg of energy
to build during the day. As a cold front and trailing jet stream
disturbance arrives Wednesday afternoon, tropical air will
explosively break through the lid, setting the stage for potent
thunderstorms to erupt across southern portions of Illinois,
Indiana and Kentucky southward to Mississippi, Alabama and the
western panhandle of Florida. Some of these storms will become
severe, spawning damaging winds, large hail and tornadoes. But, as
with most outbreaks of severe weather, the areas affected will tend
to be rather small and isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will develop over the upper Middle
West across the upper Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes as
a surface low pressure draws moist air northward. Given the
sluggishness of the low, recurrent rains could exceed two inches in
parts of Minnesota, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Iowa and northern
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds, patchy rain and drizzle will continue to affect
parts of the northern Middle Atlantic and New England Seaboards as
a floundering low pressure system remains trapped off the coast by
a blocking high pressure system over eastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Maxi Tornado
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary damage survey in the aftermath of the powerful
tornado that swept through Oklahoma on Tuesday indicated that the
twister ranked RF4S on the Fujita Scale, with winds estimated
between 207 and 260 mph. Such ``maxi'' tornadoes, which include the
most powerful F5 twisters, account for only 1 to 2 percent of the
nearly 1,000 tornadoes that occur each year in the United States.
Thus, maxi tornadoes are not common. Maxi tornadoes that strike
highly populated areas are even less common. Yet they account for
approximately two-thirds of all twister-related fatalities.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How do you choose fresh garlic?
</P>
<P>
   A. Look for a firm, plump bulb that has no obviously shriveled
or soft cloves and is not sprouting any pale yellow or green shoots
from the center. Those are signs of age and bitterness. The papery
skin covering the bulb should be dry and flaky. Avoid any heads
with dark or blackish spots, which could indicate interior mold.
Fat cloves are easier to peel and handle.
</P>
<P>
   Try not to buy garlic from a market that keeps it refrigerated
in the produce section. Moisture from the refrigerator can
encourage sprouting. If whole, unbroken heads of garlic are stored
in a cool, dry, dark place, they should keep about two months
without drying out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rise, and Fall, of Cakes
</P>
<P>
   Q: I cannot eat wheat and would like to make a flourless
chocolate cake, but I cannot get the soft, molten centers and caky
exteriors of the ones I get in restaurants. Mine are more like a
candy bar. My cakes are regular size; the restaurant cakes are
baked in individual portions. Is that the secret?
</P>
<P>
   A: Molten chocolate cakes can be baked in any size pan; the
secret lies in the recipe. For a spongy, airy exterior, a cake
needs to have structure to support its rise. Cakes and tortes that
don't rise will end up with a fudgey, candylike texture (which is
what many recipes aim for).
</P>
<P>
   The structure of flourless chocolate cakes comes from eggs
(either whole or just whites) that have been beaten into a
voluminous froth. The air incorporated into the eggs while beating
expands in the oven, just like a souffle. In fact, many of the
molten chocolate cake recipes popular these days are souffle
variations, enriched with butter and often stabilized with a touch
of ground nuts or cornstarch.
</P>
<P>
   Making Raw Eggs Safe
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a recipe for lemon icebox pie that calls for raw egg
yolks. Is there a way to raise the temperature of eggs enough to
make them safe without actually cooking them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Shirley Corriher gives directions in her book, ``Cookwise''
(William Morrow, 1997). She writes that the temperature at which
egg yolks are considered safe is 160 Fahrenheit, but holding them
at a somewhat lower temperature for a longer time is just as
effective. Keep them at 140 Fahrenheit (about the warmth of hot tap
water) for three and a half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests heating every two yolks in a small pan over very
low heat with a quarter cup of liquid from the recipe plus a half
teaspoon sugar. Stir constantly and scrape the bottom of the pan
with a spatula. At the first sign of thickening, remove the pan
from the heat and continue to stir as you immerse it in a large
bowl of cold water to stop the cooking. You can now use these yolks
instead of raw ones.
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla Flavor Without Vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the vanilla syrup that is used in soda fountains made?
I have added vanilla extract to sugar syrup, but it doesn't taste
the same.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's because vanilla-flavored soda fountain syrup doesn't
actually contain any vanilla extract. It is made from vanillin, an
artificial flavoring that tastes like vanilla, plus some other
artificial flavors that contribute to its characteristic taste. You
can buy vanilla-flavored syrups in most supermarkets. Fox's U-Bet
is one brand, 16 ounces for about $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to make something close, try using a mix of
imitation vanilla extract, corn syrup, sugar syrup and citric acid
or a touch of lemon juice. These are the main ingredients listed on
the label (other than the preservatives).
</P>
<P>
   The Use of MSG
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was MSG first used in food preparation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Monosodium glutamate, or MSG, was developed by Japanese
scientists in the 1920s. It is derived from glutamic acid, a
naturally occurring amino acid found in some types of seaweed.
Oddly, MSG is flavorless on its own but has the ability to enhance
the flavor of savory foods. On the downside, MSG can cause adverse
reactions in some people, such as headaches, dizziness, flushing
and burning. It is used in Japanese and Chinese cuisines and is
sometimes added to packaged spice mixes, soups and snack foods. If
MSG does make you ill, read all food labels carefully.

 By FELICIA R. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Baldwin said that there was no hope for anyone
who considered himself white. By that measure, Maurice Berger
figures he has a chance at salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's skin is white, but increasingly he views race as a
social construct, a thing apart from all the more nuanced ways he
defines himself. He loves to cook, take long walks and spend time
with his companion of many years. When he looks back on his own
history, he can virtually smell the Sabbath candles and feel the
way his heart raced as he learned how to shape words into thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Berger is best known as the author of ``White Lies:
Race and the Myths of Whiteness'' (Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1999), a
book that is being widely read in circles pondering issues of race
and culture. The book's admirers say it stands out from the many
books about race because it is a detailed, intimate look by a white
man into his racial identity and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Berger writes about his mentally ill father, who admired blacks
from afar, his dark-skinned Sephardic Jewish mother, who loathed
them, and the mostly stunted dreams of the black friends from the
New York housing project where he grew up. He acknowledges how his
own racism came to the fore when he had to compete with a black
classmate in college and his repugnance over his father's
flirtation with a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   He also writes about his growing awareness of how whites are
personally limited by embracing racial myths in everything from
beauty to intelligence but continue to enforce those myths among
themselves to preserve a sense of superiority and the privileges of
whiteness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glasses we have on are the glasses of race,'' Berger said
recently, using his usual soft tone of voice. ``If we, as white
people, start taking stock of how we're introduced to race, to
black and white, we can see how whiteness is privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, an art historian by training, subverts what he sees as
the prevailing orthodoxy of whiteness that James Baldwin denounced
in the 1960s. Baldwin, best known for such essay collections as
``Notes of a Native Son'' and ``The Fire Next Time,'' as well as
his novels, saw people from all countries, religions and
ethnicities become simply ``white''' when they came to the United
States. In shedding the particulars of their histories, Baldwin
said, they lose some of their humanity, a tradeoff for inclusion in
a group that exists only to exercise privilege.
</P>
<P>
   It is a delicate and sad enterprise, this race business, Berger
said the other day in his Upper West Side Manhattan apartment. Race
is such a big, complex, painful topic that no one knows where to
start. Berger is suggesting that they start with their own
histories.
</P>
<P>
   He has, to mostly critical acclaim. Laurie Adlerstein said in
The New York Times Book Review that ``White Lies'' was ``often
startlingly original.'' David Roediger, a leading scholar in the
relatively new field of white studies, said that Berger's book
``brilliantly charts'' the process of racial awareness and
contributed to a meager body of work about the origins of
anti-racism among whites.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said he had received an avalanche of mail after the
book's publication that bore testament to how provocative and
intimate a subject race remains. People wrote him about their
experiences with other groups of people and about their own racial
prejudice, isolation or fear.
</P>
<P>
   `'I've gotten everything from hugs to hate mail in the last
three months,'' said Berger, a tall, thin man with piercing eyes
and a gentle manner. He is 42 and speaks in long, thoughtful
sentences. He wears a gold band on his wedding finger, a symbol of
his commitment to Marvin Heiferman, a historian of photography and
a writer on American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point that keeps coming up is how difficult it is to get
people to talk about these issues,'' said Berger, who has a
doctorate in art history but sometimes refers to himself as ``a
little project boy.'' He is a senior fellow at the Vera List Center
for Art and Politics at the New School for Social Research and has
written and edited a number of books and articles on the arts,
legal studies and race.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney Museum of American Art and the Jewish Museum in
Manhattan and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington are among
the places where Berger has curated exhibitions, some race-related.
Current projects include part of ``The American Century''
exhibition at the Whitney and an Adrian Piper retrospective opening
at the University of Maryland in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``White Lies'' represents a curated collection of
racial tales. The book is a compilation of personal vignettes from
15 people and excerpts from literature about race _ everything from
Baldwin to ``The Bell Curve'' _ woven around Berger's recollections
of growing up poor and Orthodox Jewish in a predominantly black and
Hispanic housing project on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the book are also on the Internet
(http://fsbassociates.com/fsg/whitelies.htm). Berger, who is also
talking to an independent producer about a documentary based on
``White Lies,'' said he was mostly meeting with small groups of
people to allow more intimate discussion than a traditional
promotional tour would allow.
</P>
<P>
   Berger does not believe that Americans are anywhere near ready
for a national conversation about race. He has found that most
whites believe that racial problems ended with the passage of civil
rights laws, while he himself sees a more subtle, more insidious
racism afoot, punctuated by incidents of racial violence or
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dialogue about race gets played out in the courtroom, on
cable TV and in talk shows,'' said Berger. ``When you have a trial
like O.J. it's a catalyst for race talk or Louima or Diallo _ all
these tragedies. The media as a whole or the courtroom as a whole
is not a great place for Americans to talk about race. The best
space for discussion of race right now is the dinner table,
possibly the classroom or online, where there is the possibility of
anonymity, and mostly in our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It took Berger three years of sometimes painful memories to
write his book. He said he was able to write honestly about both
his parents because they are now dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``White Lies'' opens with the assassination of the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. Berger's father wept, the first time his
12-year-old son had seen him cry. He called the assassination a
nightmare. His mother said King was a troublemaker who deserved to
die. His mother's harangue made racism real for him in a way it had
never been.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of his mother, who believed that her dark coloring
had killed her career as a singer and an actress, adorns a wall in
his apartment. Ruth Secunda Berger was a woman who applied layers
of makeup to make her skin whiter and pomades to make her kinky
hair straighter. She was told again and again by casting agents
that her looks were too foreign, too exotic, and she was the victim
of open anti-Semitism. In his book, Berger says his mother was an
example of the irrationality of race and the mutability of racial
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walk around always with a mythic sense of who we are,''
said Berger, serving tea and madeleines in his airy living room
overlooking West End Avenue. ``There are myths about the purity of
whiteness, as seen in the conversation about Thomas Jefferson and
Sally Hemings. There is the myth of the superiority of white
intelligence, as reflected in the continuing IQ debate. There is
the myth of the danger and chaos associated with blackness, which
is demonstrated by the way people react when a black family moves
next door.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of looking at white culture and white identity started
in the academy about a decade ago and become known as whiteness
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia J. Williams, a professor of law at Columbia University
and the author of a number of books on race and culture, said that
Berger's book has ``gone beyond whiteness studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking at whiteness and saying, how is it related to my
immigration status, being Jewish, to the hair fetish?'' Ms.
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks through to a whole host of conversations. I think
the value on the one hand is that whiteness is unmarked. People who
are white don't think of themselves as having a race,'' Ms.
Williams said. ``Discussions of whiteness reveal racism for all the
compounded prejudices contained in it and makes it comprehensible
by aligning all the other prejudices. It allows other people to see
themselves as products of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said he had been asked why, as a white person, he cared
so much about race. It is a question he has asked and answered
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, my passion was a result of growing up with black
people and seeing the myths I had been fed were lies,'' Berger
said. ``I grew up very poor. I grew up in the projects, most of my
friends were black or Hispanic. A lot of these kids saw their lives
taken away from them. I knew because of my skin color I had power.
I could get out of there.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these kids didn't get through high school. Those that
did didn't make it through college,'' he added. ``A lot of these
kids lost their parents young, partly because of poverty, partly
because of racism. These were parents who were working hard, who
didn't know if they were coming or going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an anti-racist is good for white people,'' he said. ``If
we can free ourselves from the mechanisms of bigotry maybe it will
free us in other ways.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: BIOGRAPHICAL SOUND BITES? WELL, THESE HAVE
TEETH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who was it who wrote a long letter, apologizing that he didn't
have time for a short one? I don't remember, and I can't look it
up. Too much to do; no time to do it. It is therefore something of
a relief to pick up the first four volumes in a new series of
books, biographies of 150 pages or so, well written by people who
know.
</P>
<P>
   The series is called Penguin Lives, and at first glance it might
be seen as a kind of biographical literature for the age of the
sound bite. In fact, in its way, the new books are biographical
literature for the age of celebrity, at least that small stream
running off the great river of celebrity that is literary
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of the series (full disclosure: he is a former New
York Times editor, James Atlas, who is a friend of mine) had two
interdependent ideas. One is that there is a market for short
biographies when so many biographies are of the 600-, 700-, even
1,000-page variety. ( Atlas, somewhat paradoxically, has been
working for many years on a very long biography of Saul Bellow.)
</P>
<P>
   The other part of Atlas' concept was to have famous writers do
these biographies. And so, for example, the first two to appear
were ``Crazy Horse'' by Larry McMurtry (author of ``Lonesome
Dove,'' ``Terms of Endearment'' and many other popular novels) and
``Proust'' by Edmund White. White is less famous than McMurtry, but
he has written 11 books, including ``Genet: A Biography,'' which
won a couple of major literary prizes and is a celebrity in
literary criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Soon two more Penguin Lives will be published, ``Mozart'' by
Peter Gay and ``St. Augustine'' by Garry Wills. I have read these
two in galley form, and doing so makes clear that Penguin Lives are
far from a kind of biographical Cliff Notes, a Classic Comics of
the deservedly famous. Certainly, there are no major departures in
these books, no radical reinterpretations or troves of previously
unknown information. But Gay and Wills are serious writers who
treat their subjects with discernment, clarity and elegance. Most
of all, they both have a point of view, a theme, a vision that sets
them gently at odds with other accounts of the same lives that they
have studied.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguin series joins other sets of short biographical
presentations on what are usually long subjects. But short divides
into two rough categories, what might be called high short and low
short. In the former rank, for example, is Paul Strathern's
continuing series on philosophers (``Wittgenstein in 90 Minutes''
and a dozen or so others published so far by Ivan R. Dee in
Chicago). Switching media and moving down an intellectual level or
two, there is ``Biography,'' a series of cable television programs
running one hour apiece, about the amount of concentrated time one
would need to read, say, Wills' ``Augustine.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving further toward the mass market, is, say, People magazine,
which is, in its way, a series of short biographies, usually of
living people.
</P>
<P>
   Lives, in other words, are in, especially lives recounted
succinctly. Historians and philosophers may debate the role of the
individual in history and whether, as Tolstoy said, supposedly
seminal individuals are nothing more than vessels of larger forces.
The reading and television-viewing public, whether they are
consuming the Penguin Lives or People magazine, have voted on this
issue, and have decreed that genius is interesting, instructive,
inspiring; that far from being a kind of illusion, it matters. The
public in this sense agrees with Thomas Carlyle, who famously
declared: ``The history of the world is but the biography of great
men.''
</P>
<P>
   Short biographies do not necessarily indicate some lesser
yearning or interest, simply a demand that these needs be satisfied
more quickly. Atlas and his chief investor, the financier Kenneth
Lipper, are hoping that the public's desire for the essence of a
life will make a success of books whose chief feature is an
elegant, literary brevity. And on the intellectual scale, from high
short to low short, Penguin Lives has a claim to being at the top
of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for example, in his account of Mozart, Gay begins with the
pithy remark: ``The life of Mozart is the triumph of genius over
precociousness.'' Wills begins with an equally epigrammatic
statement: ``A word from his inmost being goes direct to our most
guarded self; `My heart's fellow will love in me what You (Lord)
tell is lovable, deplore in me what You tell is deplorable.'''
Nobody who reads those lines will assume that he is in for an
especially easy time of it. The message is that these books will
take a bit of effort, even if less time than other books, and,
moreover, that the effort will be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Gay's ``Mozart'' is an especially appealing brief work, one that
manages to probe deeply even if not at great length. He covers such
essential subjects as Mozart's excessively demanding father and the
implications of his presence on the son's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolfgang Mozart was a good son, but was Leopold Mozart a good
father?'' he asks. He gives marvelous examples of Mozart's personal
and verbal crudeness, in such remarkable contrast with the music.
He disposes of myths: for example, that Mozart died penniless after
being poisoned by the rival composer Antonio Salieri and was buried
in a pauper's grave. And he deals knowledgeably with the
``astonishing caliber'' of the music itself, but he does so
unsentimentally, without mawkish hero-worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The widely accepted portrait of Mozart the lonely genius
listening to his inner voices alone is a romantic distortion of the
more mundane reality,'' Gay writes. ``Once he was moved to compose,
inspiration took over, but the inspiration for that inspiration was
likely a commission he had just received.''
</P>
<P>
   Wills' book is a more difficult slender volume, in part because
Augustine is a less accessible figure. Wills subjects Augustine's
writings to a close scrutiny to test the conventional wisdom about
his subject and in some instances to argue against it. He begins
with the idea that Augustine's best-known book, ``Confessions,''
does not refer mainly to his supposed youthful debauches but is
actually testimony on his entire theology, his deep examination of
himself as part of a lifelong search for God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beginning in 397, there was an implosion of his mind, down
into himself, back into his past, as the place where God could be
found,'' Wills writes. ``His own mystery was an echo of God's; and
God was hiding in the vaster areas he felt opening within.''
</P>
<P>
   This and many other passages like it in Wills' short book are
uncompromising in their rigor. Brevity, in other words, may be the
soul of Penguin Lives but downmarket simplification is not.

DANCING BOOMS ON BROADWAY: MORE JOBS, SAME OLD GRIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aside from her spiky frosted hair, it was hard to
pick out Amy Brewer in the two dozen or so black-clad dancers at
the Broadway Dance Center strutting, twirling and kicking, doing
the same routine 8, 10, 12, 14 times to the 30-second finale of
Natalie Cole's ``Orange-Colored Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Allison Ellner-Teitelbaum, who owns the five-floor studio
that is ground zero for New York dance, saw something she liked
amid the symphony of black spandex and high-heeled Capezio
character shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oooooh,'' she said approvingly as she watched the working
dancers and the wannabes in Tony Stevens' advanced professional
theater dancing class one recent afternoon. ``Amy wheedled her way
up to the front. Good for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the front increases the likelihood of being noticed
by the teacher, who may one day be casting a show, and it denotes a
bit of chutzpah, neither of which is likely to hurt in the
ultra-competitive world of theatrical dancing.
</P>
<P>
   After years of decline, as the gold standard on Broadway became
song and drama mega-shows like ``Phantom of the Opera'' or ``Les
Miserables'' and the great choreographer-directors of the past
departed, it is suddenly a fertile time for dancers on Broadway.
Dance thrives in ``Chicago'' and ``Fosse,'' which feature classic
Bob Fosse choreography by the theater's top dancers; in the
youthful sweat-athon ``Footloose,'' and in shows as diverse as
``Ragtime,'' ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain logic for the resurgence of dancers. In an
age of body lust, the long, lean ``Chicago'' dancers on the ads
running the length of city buses have the best-toned abs and thighs
around. And in the cyclical rhythms of Broadway fashion, dance has
been out so long, it is probably time for it to be in.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see them with their turned-out duck feet, baggy
pants, pulled-back hair and backpacks showing up to teach or take
classes at the Broadway Dance Center on West 57th Street. You can
find them going in for the dancer's best friend, physical tuneups
at Performing Arts Physical Therapy or West Side Chiropractic. You
can spot them, at least the younger ones, after shows having a
glass of wine or a martini at Arriba Arriba, Barrymore's, Joe Allen
or the other theater-district hangouts.
</P>
<P>
   The life is too diffuse and tribal _ each show its own world _
to allow much in the way of shared experience aside from the aches
and pains and economic uncertainty. What they have in common is an
almost blindingly intense devotion to their craft and a realization
that few careers provide less of a secure foothold on status and
security than dancing for a living in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of dance going on now, but there are a lot more
good dancers too; they're well trained and they look great,'' said
Jane Lanier, a featured dancer in ``Fosse'' who has been dancing
professionally since 1983, when she was 21. ``So there's
opportunity, but unless you're totally committed, this is a crazy
choice. You would never want to try it unless it's something you
almost felt that you had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brewer, a 22-year-old from Seattle who arrived in New York
last July, represents life at the bottom of the dance food chain.
She lives with three friends _ a dancer, a singer-actress and a
theater technician _ in a $1,200-a-month three-bedroom apartment in
Astoria and works at a Starbucks coffee shop and as an usher at
``The Lion King.'' She came as part of an internship at the
Broadway Dance Center, where about 4,500 people take lessons each
week for $12.50 apiece. The internship allowed her to take 10
classes a week for six months, and she now takes about five, part
of a work-study program.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at age 4, Ms. Brewer grew up doing ballet, tap, jazz
dancing, baton twirling and the rest. She got hooked on Broadway
dancing after turning on the Rosie O'Donnell show and seeing the
cast of ``Chicago'' with Bebe Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my dream show,'' she said. ``Since I've been here I've
seen it about 15 times. Can I do that? Well, I know I've got to get
better. But I don't feel that I can't do that. I feel my time will
come. You have to feel that way if you want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   If she succeeds, it will not be just because of the way she
dances.
</P>
<P>
   First, almost no one makes it as just a dancer these days.
Nearly everyone has to sing, act and dance, be what's dutifully
called a triple threat. Second, Ms. Brewer is already learning that
who you know on the dance floor can mean as much as how you dance
on it. This is not necessarily invoked cynically. It is assumed
that no one works, particularly in the top shows, unless their
dancing is first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also assumed that with a glut of talent,
choreographers are most likely to pick dancers they know. That
means the dancers will know what the choreographer wants and the
choreographer will know the work habits and personality of the
dancers. It is no accident that Stevens' next class _ the day
before he stages an audition _ is completely jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all theatrical dance careers lead to Broadway.
Between growing music video production in Los Angeles and show
tours, young dancers often chart career paths that owe little to
the world of ``A Chorus Line.'' One of the more vivid presences at
the Broadway Dance Center is Glenn Douglas Packard, a 27-year-old
with streaked hair, the son of a Michigan dairy farmer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Packard runs a talent agency and markets himself by cooking up
cover stories for Dance Spirit magazine. He has done tours or shows
in Norway, Hawaii and Japan, was part of a troupe that danced for
the King of Morocco and is part of a show being put together by
singer Jimmy Buffett. He is the dancer as entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like variety,'' he said. ``I'd be bored on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   For those with more traditional aspirations, the road to
Broadway begins with endless lessons in childhood and leads through
television commercials, theme parks, industrial shows and cruise
ships where the idea is both to dance and to oversee the
shuffleboard game.
</P>
<P>
   Some take a different path. Bernard Dotson, who dances in
``Ragtime,'' got a business degree and was working in a corporate
job in Los Angeles 13 years ago when he decided that what he really
wanted to do was dance. He started taking 12 dance classes a week,
got a job six months later in a show doing a three-month European
tour and has been working steadily ever since.
</P>
<P>
   A more typical story, if any dancer's life is typical, is that
of Serena Soffer, who dances in ``Footloose.'' She grew up in
Edison, N.J. Her father was a used-car salesman, and her mother had
been an acrobat and contortionist in a German circus. Ms. Soffer
began dancing at age 3, got her Actors' Equity card at 10 and
entered the dancers' purgatory of industrial shows, where teams of
dancers hop planes to Florida or Las Vegas to do 15-minute shows 9
or 10 times a day at conventions and trade shows for a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make thousands of dollars, but it's a nightmare,'' said
Ms. Soffer, who has a Medusa's head of blond hair and carries her
gear in a pink Rugrats bag. ``You get off the plane, and it's cold
and strenuous on your body, and you have to do these shows over and
over, selling a fabric or pushing a product. I've never done theme
parks, but they're about the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Her break came when she was hired by A.C. Ciulla for a cabaret
show, ``Hollywood to Broadway,'' which ran for almost two years at
the Tatou Supper Club on the East Side. When Ciulla was hired for
``Footloose,'' he brought her and two other dancers with him.
</P>
<P>
   Now she sleeps until 11 or so every day, spends her days
cooking, taking classes, working on other dance projects or going
to physical therapy, then shows up for work each evening to do the
show.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the food chain are the dancers in ``Chicago'' and
``Fosse,'' many of them the best-known and most skilled dancers of
their generation. Elizabeth Parkinson and Scott Wise, two of the
featured dancers in ``Fosse,'' share both a job and a life. They
plan to marry in June.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Broadway after a career with the Joffrey Ballet,
Feld Ballet and Donald Byrd. Broadway, she says, is like a parallel
universe to ballet, with its own rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``In ballet, you have to keep a higher level technically, so in
one way it's physically more demanding,'' said Ms. Parkinson, who
at 25 is the youngest dancer in ``Fosse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But dancing on Broadway demands more on a performance level.
You can't get away with just being technically amazing the way you
can in ballet. You really have to perform. The individual
performance can be more difficult in ballet, but you don't do it
eight times a week, week after week, the way we do. And the way you
get your job is so different. In Broadway your role is assigned
before you start the work process. In ballet you're a member of a
company, so you're always competing for roles. There's a lot more
angst in ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise, who at 40 has been dancing for 36 years, has won two Tonys
and was nominated for a third this week for featured actor in a
musical. He is one of Broadway's best-known male dancers, with
credits including ``Victor/Victoria,'' ``State Fair,'' ``Damn
Yankees,'' ``Guys and Dolls,'' ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' and ``A
Chorus Line.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, dancers have it better now than they did in the
past, he said. ``The shoes are better, the stages are better, they
have sprung floors that can really save your knees, back and
ankles,'' he said. ``Dancers have more protection, pregnancy
leaves, things you didn't have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wise is not sure Broadway will ever take the same risks with
dance or see the same kind of commanding choreographer-directors of
the past like Fosse or Robbins or Michael Bennett. And he thinks
the tempestuous autocrats of the past demanded a consistently
higher level than choreographers now do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more corporate and much more expensive now,'' he
said. ``Dance is hard to sell at a producing table. You can read a
script or sing a song, but it's not easy to get people in costumes
dancing around. The way the machine is built right now, I'm not
sure that even if you had a Fosse or a Bennett, they'd be able to
get their work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Dancers, like most people, may be prone to nostalgia. But what
Wise seems to miss is not just an era but also a sensibility, the
passing of Broadway's ``gypsies,'' veteran dancers who flitted from
show to show. Now dancers tend to stay with a show for two or three
years, then sometimes do it on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you would do a couple of shows a year at
least,'' Wise said. ``It was taboo to stay on a show for more than
a year. It was as if you couldn't get another job. Now because
shows are so expensive and there are fewer of them, people do shows
for two, two and a half, three years. Producers don't like it if
you leave, and they make it contractually harder to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, as ever, a tough way to live. Dancers remain at the low
end of Broadway's pecking order in pay and in status. They are
always one injury away from being out of work. And in a culture
obsessed with youth, no one hears the clock tick louder than they
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of aches and pains, and you have to learn to
pace yourself,'' said Ms. Soffer, s 29. ``There's a dancer in my
show who is 17, she's absolutely brilliant, and I have to realize I
can't always keep up with the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Fosse'' and ``Chicago'' feature mature
dancers, most of them well on the other side of 30. Ms. Lanier, for
example, struts her stuff in ``Fosse'' while raising two young
children. And though the heyday of Fosse, Robbins or Bennett
musicals is gone, many see the current popularity of dance as an
encouraging sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balanchine is gone, but at some point another choreographer
like Balanchine will come along,'' said Ann Reinking, choreographer
of ``Chicago'' and co-director and co-choreographer of ``Fosse.''
``It's the same on Broadway. It might take 50 years, it might take
5. But in the meantime there's incredibly good work for us to dance
and explore and re-explore.''

AVERY FISHER PRIZE GOES TO WOMEN FOR FIRST TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three American violinists, Sarah Chang, Pamela Frank
and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, have been named winners of the 1999
Avery Fisher Prize. This is the first time in the 25-year history
of the prestigious award, founded by Avery Fisher to support
outstanding performing musicians, that the prize has gone to women.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was last given to pianist Garrick Ohlsson in 1994, the
year of Fisher's death. This year, to commemorate the 25th
anniversary, the cash award has been doubled to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Avery Fisher Prize is separate from the Avery Fisher Career
Grant, which awards $10,000 to each of up to five emerging artists
annually. There have been 73 Fisher Career Grants since 1974, and
many of the recipients have been women.
</P>
<P>
   The more select Avery Fisher Prize is awarded only when an
executive awards committee agrees upon a musician who merits it.
The committee has 11 members, artists like pianist Emanuel Ax and
the cellist Yo-Yo Ma (both previous recipients), as well as
administrators like Lincoln Center president Nathan Leventhal and
Juilliard president Joseph Polisi.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Borda, executive director of the New York Philharmonic
and a member of the Avery Fisher Artist Program since 1991, said
recently that there had been much discussion about the absence of
female recipients during the selection of prize winners in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about it, I wouldn't mislead you,'' she said.
``There were times we tried to select a woman, or someone on the
committee would push for a particular woman artist. But it didn't
fly for whatever reasons with the full committee. And in making
selections, excellence always comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, she said, the board wanted to ``make a major
statement'' by honoring three female artists. ``We think the
results are terrific,'' she added, with violinists ``from different
generations and from different schools of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chang, 18, born in Philadelphia to Korean parents, has
best-selling recordings on the EMI label and has been a soloist
with orchestras around the world, including the London Symphony,
the Vienna Philharmonic and the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   New York-born Ms. Frank, 31, the daughter of pianists Claude
Frank and Lilian Kallir, balances her burgeoning solo career with a
deep commitment to chamber music.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg, 38, born in Rome, has won an ardent
following, as well some criticism, for her highly charged music
making and dramatic performances. All three musicians had received
Avery Fisher Career Grants.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ax, Ma and Ohlsson, past winners of the Avery Fisher
Prize include the pianists Murray Perahia, Richard Goode, Horacio
Gutierrez, Andre Watts and Yefim Bronfman; the cellist Lynn
Harrell; the violinist Elmar Oliveira, and the clarinetist Richard
Stoltzman.
</P>
<P>
   The prizes are to be presented Wednesday night at a gala
reception onstage at Avery Fisher Hall.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What technological advance made the South what it
is today? No, not the cotton gin, pick-up truck or deep-fat fryer.
</P>
<P>
   The irrefutable answer is air conditioning, the engineering
marvel that transformed Dixie from a struggling region of the
country into an economic and demographic power without hardly
breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Now the invention that put the buckle on the Sun Belt is being
celebrated in a first-ever museum exhibition that explores the
profound social, cultural and architectural changes wrought by the
conquest of climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other factors in the rise of the South, but air
conditioning certainly makes a difference,'' said Chrysanthe
Broikos, associate curator at the National Building Museum, where
the novel exhibition opened Saturday. ``You can't imagine Central
Florida as the home of Disney World or Universal Studios without
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors enter ``Stay Cool! Air Conditioning America,'' via an
oversized sheet-metal air conditioning duct. They journey through
three galleries that employ videos, photographs, old
advertisements, artifacts and interactive displays to trace the
development of engineered air and its impact on the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   In the initial room, a glimpse of ``Hot America'' in the days
before air conditioning makes one thirst for an icy lemonade as
pictures show sweltering citizens trying to keep cool by sleeping
on city fire escapes.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition gives ample evidence of the role of air
conditioning in the evolution of the modern South. A large
thermometer traces the demographic shift of people migrating from
the region during the first half of the century, peaking with a net
loss of 3 million people in the 1950s. The movement stabilized in
the 1960s and completely reversed itself in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Broikos said that decade's population count is sometimes
referred to as the ``air conditioning census'' since it was the
first to reflect the population trends hinged to advances in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air conditioning helped fuel the explosive postwar growth of
Sunbelt cities like Houston, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Miami,''
proclaims the exhibition, which also attributes the shift in
migration patterns to civil rights gains.
</P>
<P>
   While air conditioning has been important to the development of
the South, the region was also key to the development of air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the air-conditioning industry began in the North,
most of its early growth took place in the South,'' wrote Raymond
Arsenault, a University of South Florida history professor, in a
Journal of Southern History essay used as a basis for the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the father of air conditioning is considered to be John
Gorrie, an Apalachicola, Fla., physician who first began
experimenting with mechanical cooling in the 1830s in his search
for a way to help victims of subtropical diseases. He had visions
of artificially cooled cities even then.
</P>
<P>
   Other early pioneers included textile mill and tobacco industry
engineers determined to control the temperature and humidity
problems that affected their production. Arsenault credits Stuart
Cramer, a Charlotte, N.C., engineer, with coining the term air
conditioning in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   But in the South as elsewhere, it was movie theatres that
brought the general public its first real taste of air conditioning
in the Roaring '20s. Movie houses advertised their ``comfort
control'' as prominently as their films and no longer had to close
for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenault recounted how at the ``grand opening of St.
Petersburg's Florida theatre in 1926, the proud management had the
temperature down so low that ladies in evening dresses almost
froze.''
</P>
<P>
   The home air conditioning boom took off in the 1950s with the
development of affordable residential units, and the shape of
housing was changed forever. Gone were thick insulating walls and
wrap-around porches, giving way to plate glass and sliding doors.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the consequences of air conditioning are necessarily
positive. The exhibition points out that changing home design
confined people indoors, sacrificing the sense of community they
gained from visiting porch-to-porch.
</P>
<P>
   And on a global scale, the chlorofluorocarbons used in air
conditioning refrigerants have been blamed for damaging the earth's
ozone layer and are being banned worldwide, forcing the industry to
develop other, less harmful coolants and new hybrid methods of
naturally and artificially cooled air.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition also raises the prospect that the advent of air
conditioning precipitated the decline of Southern literature, as
the cool air sapped the emotion from the region's fiery authors.
Consider William Faulkner, who has been replaced by John Grisham as
the first man of letters of Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can one imagine Faulkner writing `Absalom, Absalom!' under the
spell of central air?'' asks writer Fred Hobson in a quotation
prominently displayed in the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenault argued in his essay that air conditioning forever
altered the very way of life that made the South unique in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southerners, more than most other Americans, have tied
themselves to a local geography,'' he wrote. ``Their lives and
identities have been rooted in a particular piece of turf _ a
county, a town, a neighborhood, a homestead, a family graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet in recent years, thanks in part to air conditioning,
Southern particularism has been overwhelmed by an almost endless
string of look-alike chain stores, tract houses, glassed-in high
rises, and perhaps, most important, enclosed shopping malls. The
modern shopping mall is the cathedral of air-conditioned culture
and it symbolizes the placelessness of the New South.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000-square-foot exhibition was financed by $250,000 in
grants from the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute and
the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating &AMP; Air Conditioning
Engineers. It will be open through Jan. 2 at the museum, which is
situated in a spectacular building somewhat off the beaten track in
the Judiciary Square area of Washington.

 &HT;    SEC HEAD TARGETS ONLINE BROKERAGE ADS
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Online brokerage ads that play on a get-rich-quick
theme are ``demeaning'' to investors, the chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday as he promised
closer scrutiny of their content.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't rule out the fact that some of these commercials are
tongue-in-cheek,'' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said at the National
Press Club. He cited a Discover Brokerage Direct ad in which a tow
truck driver tells of buying his own island nation with his stock
trading profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a market environment such as the one we're in, where
many investors are susceptible to quixotic euphoria, I'm worried
these commercials step over the line and border on
irresponsibility,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said he has asked the National Association of Securities
Dealers ``to hold a round-table on advertising to add to the work
they're already doing to improve fairness in advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The round-table discussion is likely to be held in mid-June,
said spokeswoman Nancy A. Condon of NASD Regulation, the regulatory
arm of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, NASD Regulation issued reminders that
advertising and promotional material should not ``set unrealistic
expectations'' about the speed of online trading or the opportunity
to make money in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discover Brokerage Direct supports Chairman Levitt's vision of
an informed investing public who are aware of the risk as well as
the reward of investing,'' the unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
said in a statement. ``We would welcome the opportunity to
participate in a NASD-led round-table on advertising for online
brokerages.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's Levitt also took a crack at day traders, who hold
stocks only for brief periods, and at the operations of online
brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't think day traders are speculating,'' said
Levitt, ``because traditional speculation requires some market
knowledge. They are instead gambling, which really doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   While he reiterated a warning that investors are responsible for
their own actions, Levitt also cautioned that online brokerages
still have ``obligations to customers.'' He cited the need to
ensure that online brokerages can handle an increasing number of
transactions and respond to e-mail and phone inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt also said the SEC has started a ``broad-reaching''
examination to make sure brokerages provide customers with the best
prices available when they buy or sell stock.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he sent a letter Tuesday ``to all of the on-line
brokerage firms requesting they improve the quality of their
disclosure to investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt wants the brokerages to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Explain that transactions on the Internet may not be
instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spell out clearly the trading limitations and risks in a
volatile market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop ways to help investors more easily spot mistakes when
they place orders to buy or sell stocks online.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adequately warn investors about the risks and costs of buying
stocks on margin, or using borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make it clear that getting in on a hot initial public
offering, or getting as many shares as an investor would prefer, is
not always possible.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt also said he would like online brokerages and Internet
providers hosting chat rooms to provide links to the SEC's investor
education site (http://www.sec.gov/invkhome.htm).
</P>
<P>
   He did not propose new regulations governing online trading, but
didn't rule out the possibility the SEC may someday need ``new
approaches to better meet the imperatives of the Internet.''

LOW-KEY THRILLS AT LEGOLAND

   There's something fascinating about other people's obsessions.
Take Legoland, the newly opened theme park in the golfing mecca of
Carlsbad, Calif., about 30 miles north of San Diego. The park is a
sea of primary colors that covers 128 acres and includes the usual
range of attractions and rides. But, at least judging by the
interests of my two children, Marina, 7, and Sammy, 5, it was the
odd, obsessive character of Miniland that most captured their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Miniland section of the park is a model builder's dream come
true, where the makers of Lego _ the small plastic building blocks
that fill playrooms everywhere in the industrialized world _ have
faithfully recreated miniature cityscapes out of these brightly
hued bricks in a frighteningly precise level of detail.
</P>
<P>
   Washington includes, for instance, the Capitol, the White House
and all the favorite monuments and historic sites, at a height of
four feet or so. In addition, there are protesters with placards,
multirace families enjoying picnics in front of the Washington
Monument (but without the scaffolding that currently covers the
real one) and even people waving to the President in his limousine.
Midtown Manhattan has hot dog vendors and taxis. And there is even
Belvedere Fountain from Central Park. There is also a New England
harbor, downtown San Francisco and even New Orleans, with a jazz
funeral parade winding through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, look, the boat's moving,'' said my daughter, pointing to
the tourist barge gliding along the artificial Potomac. My son
raced around and counted three such boats and then marveled at a
tiny Lego windsurfer in a small San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   And then, a few minutes later, they wanted to know what else we
were going to do. That seems to sum up the delight and problem with
this park: fascination, but hardly enough to fill a day.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland, which opened on March 20, cost $130 million and took
several years to build. It is about 100 miles south of Los Angeles
just off the major north-south artery, Interstate 5, and has to
compete with a host of major theme parks, including Disneyland,
Knott's Berry Farm, Universal Studios, Six Flags and Sea World, not
to mention various zoos and the biggest theme park of all, the
Southern California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland is going through some understandable growing pains.
Lines are at times exceptionally slow, from getting into the
parking lot to getting onto the more popular rides, which include
the Sky Cycle, the Driving School and the Kid Power Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Mindstorms, a workshop where kids are taught how to build
motorized Lego robots and vehicles, requires reservations made the
day of a visit. But on a recent Sunday it was booked solid by
midmorning, and an attendant said that has been the norm on
weekends. The landscaping has not had much time to grow full and
tall, so there is a dearth of shade. On the positive side, at least
for parents, Legoland is not designed so that kids are constantly
shrieking for merchandise. There are shops with Lego paraphernalia,
but they are not as omnipresent as at, say, Disneyland, or as
intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   But Legoland seems to be based on a different premise from that
of many other theme parks, where the focus is frequently on
thrills. Here, the emphasis is on comforting, childlike pleasures,
aimed at a somewhat younger audience than the other parks. It is
based on the premise that if kids love Lego blocks, they will love
an amusement park built around them and, literally, out of them.
The question is not whether that captures children's attention, but
for how long. My kids grew restless and wondered how they would
fill their day after some excited moments. So did I.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Legoland is aimed in general at a younger audience
than, say, Universal Studios. The company says it is for children
from 2 to 12, but it seems skewed toward the younger end of the
range. It is also expensive. The entry fee is $32 a day for adults
and $25 for children 3 through 16, with another $6 for parking. The
fee covers all the rides, and there are four restaurants and many
snack stands spread throughout the park that sell food at prices
typical for theme parks, not cheap but not outrageous either, with
kids' meals available for between $3 and $5.
</P>
<P>
   The Lego group is based in Denmark, and this is its third theme
park; the others are in Billund, Denmark, and Windsor, England. All
the parks are celebrations of the famous Lego bricks. The standard
eight-knob bricks are about an inch and a quarter by a half inch,
and just over a half inch thick, and any six bricks can be combined
in 102,981,500 ways, in case you were wondering. Thirty million of
them were used to construct the attractions in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland is convenient to the freeway, but the line at the
entrance, though short, took nearly 20 minutes. Once we parked, and
then waited 15 minutes to buy passes, the kids scampered happily
through the multihued gate.
</P>
<P>
   The first attraction near the entrance is the Village Green.
There is a slow boat ride through Fairy Tale Brook, where there are
trolls and other characters made from _ what else? _ Lego bricks.
There is also a menagerie of large, nearly life-sized Lego animals:
elephants spouting water, lions and the like. And there are a
couple of outdoor theaters where humorous stage shows are
performed, such as a clown act done on a fire engine.
</P>
<P>
   Close at hand after that is the Ridge, a slightly raised area
with two of the more popular (read: crowded) rides. The Sky Cycle
is a cycle-of-sorts, for two or three, decorated in vivid colors,
that progresses along an elevated track under power from the
riders. The Kid Power Tower has seats, where a parent and child can
sit, buckled in, side by side. They tug on a rope to lift the seats
to the top of a tower, about 20 feet up, and then can drop very
slowly down again by letting go.
</P>
<P>
   Gentle boat cruises on a man-made lake run along the shores of
Miniland, where the short urban towers shimmer under the Southern
California sun.
</P>
<P>
   Fun Town, which is nearby, includes the Driving School, where
children are instructed on driving methods and then set loose in
mini-cars on a course of roads and stop lights. There's a Junior
Driving School for those under 6 and a Sky Patrol, with small
helicopters that pump up and down and turn about.
</P>
<P>
   We found Castle Hill, a sort of medieval castle themed area, to
be the most engaging part of the park. The Dragon, a small roller
coaster, offers the closest thing to a thrill ride at Legoland. The
wait is long and the ride brief, just a couple of minutes, but the
twists and turns had children shrieking delightedly.
</P>
<P>
   The Hideaways, also in Castle Hill, is a giant playground maze
and climbing gym, perfect for games of tag. At the least, it gives
children itchy from waiting in lines a chance to unwind and blow
off some pent-up energy _ although it is just a slightly larger
version of the playgrounds you can find in many public parks.
</P>
<P>
   The Imagination Zone offers a very different experience from the
rest of the park: it is indoors, a welcome relief on a warm day,
and it is a bit more challenging. In one section, kids can choose
which model they want to build, such as a vehicle or robot, then
check out a kit with lots of Lego bricks to build the item at
little desks. The bricks must be returned when the child is
finished.
</P>
<P>
   There is another area for smaller children where there are large
boxes of the larger Lego blocks known as Duplo. Kids can build at
work desks or on the floor, where many gathered because of the
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mindstorms attraction is the most sophisticated challenge in
the Imagination Zone. At 45-minute intervals, older children enter
and use the most advanced company product, Lego Technic bricks, to
build what are essentially robots. The park suggests that only
children 8 years old and up sign up. For those interested, it is
advisable to rush to the Mindstorms immediately after you enter the
park to book.

REP. SWEENEY INTRODUCES AIRLINE COMPETITION LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories) ,
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. John Sweeney watched the price of his weekly
airline ticket from Albany, N.Y., to Washington, D.C. rise by 25
percent in recent weeks so Tuesday he joined a growing number of
lawmakers urging Congress to increase airline competition in small-
and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who is vice-chair of the aviation subcommittee of the
House Transportation Committee, introduced legislation that would
encourage smaller carriers to serve places like Albany. The measure
includes $65 million to help smaller airports build additional
runways and gates that are necessary to attract new airlines.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the jump in his ticket price and the recent reduction
in the number of US Airways' flights from New York City's LaGuardia
Airport to Syracuse, N.Y., as evidence ``that some airlines are
moving in a direction opposite to consumer demand to provide better
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline competition and ``passenger bill of rights'' legislation
has become a hot issue in Congress as frequent-flying lawmakers,
like many of their constituents, have become increasingly
frustrated with rising airfares and delays.
</P>
<P>
   Recent government studies have shown that while airfares have
dropped at many large airports that are served by a number of
carriers, fares have risen in places like Albany that are served by
fewer airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, a Republican freshman from Albany, held hearings last
month on airline competition issues and said he and other lawmakers
tried to send the nation's major airlines a message that they had
better improve service or Congress would increase its regulation of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense by many of us in Congress that the major
airlines are approaching this with an arrogant attitude,'' Sweeney
said. ``I can't say how angry I am at their response.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said he now pays $670 for a round-trip ticket to
Washington, D.C., up from the $536 he paid six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who is working with local officials to bring Southwest
Airlines to Albany, said the airport needs to build two additional
gates to accommodate the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would allow the Department of Transportation (DOT)
to give smaller airlines additional landing and take-off rights at
four airports in New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., on routes
to small- and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law the number of hourly landings and take-offs is
limited at Chicago's O'Hare, New York's Kennedy and LaGuardia
airports and Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport. The
slot system, which refers to landings and takeoffs, was implemented
at the four airports in 1968 to reduce delays.
</P>
<P>
   A recent General Accounting Office report said the slot system
is dominated by large airlines and gives them virtual monopolies at
those airports and little incentive to cut fares.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's bill would also establish a $120 million annual loan
program through the DOT to help small carriers purchase jets that
would be used to help serve small and mid-sized airports.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also give DOT the authority to crack down on
so-called predatory pricing practices. This occurs when a new,
often small airline, enters a new market. Large carriers then drop
their prices on routes served by the new airline in order to drive
it out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Smallen, a DOT spokesperson, said the DOT already has this
authority but is in the process of writing new guidelines to more
clearly define predatory pricing practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal is to establish a level playing field for
low-fare carriers,'' he said. The new guidelines, which have been
vigorously fought by large airlines, probably won't be final until
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said his legislation is designed to complement a broader
measure authored by Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House
Transportation Committee, that would impose fines on airlines which
keep passengers waiting inside airplanes that are on the ground for
more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's bill would require so-called hub airports, in which a
large carrier often controls a majority of gates, to submit a plan
to Congress detailing how they would open up the hub airport to
increased competition in order to receive additional federal funds.
Delta Airlines, for example, controls 80 percent of the market in
Atlanta while Northwest controls 79 percent of the gates in its hub
airports of Minneapolis and Detroit, according the House
Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz. and Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., contains many of the same provisions as Shuster's
and Sweeney's measures.

   High Water For Ratings
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Noah's Ark'' was the biggest mini-series of the
television eseason in terms of ratings and reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The two-part movie, which starred Jon Voight as Noah, reached
about 50 million viewers Sunday night, the largest number for any
movie this season. Although the number of viewers fell Monday to
about 42 million, the film still dominated the night. The movie had
a larger audience than this year's other highly promoted NBC
mini-series, ``The '60s'' and ``The Temptations.''
</P>
<P>
   But NBC and many of its affiliated stations also reported
receiving hundreds of calls complaining that the film diverged too
much from the story of Noah presented in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The clamor was enough for NBC to issue a statement defending the
``artistic and historical license'' taken by the film but
apologizing to viewers if they found ``the treatment of the
material objectionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The mini-series expanded on the rather limited account in the
Bible by having Noah live in the town of Sodom, be a friend of Lot
and his wife (who do not appear in the Bible until after the story
of Noah), and even fight a naval engagement after the flood against
Lot, who has become an eye-patch-wearing pirate.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, NBC said the film ``remains faithful to the
essential spirit and values of faith and humanity in the story of
Noah, as told in the Book of Genesis in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   The mini-series did have a disclaimer at the start of each part:
``For dramatic effect, we have taken dramatic license with some of
the events of the mighty epic of Noah and the flood.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings, if not the reaction, surely will make CBS feel
better about a planned mini-series of its own. Next season CBS is
to present a four-hour movie called simply ``Jesus.'' CBS is
already promising a film that emphasizes the humanity of the lead
character, although it will also feature several miracles. Those
who have seen the first draft of the script describe it as a
portrait of the adult Jesus, who starts out as a carpenter before
moving on to his broader mission.
</P>
<P>
   The production of ``Jesus'' may be one of the most expensive in
recent television history, with a budget estimated at $30 million.
Locations in Morocco will be standing in for the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   While Gary Oldman has been signed to play Pontius Pilate, the
title role has not been cast.

<P>
   Truth in Packaging
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network issued a rather sheepish statement Monday
promising that any staged re-enactments used in the popular
``reality specials,'' like ``World's Wildest Police Videos'' or
``When Animals Attack,'' would be clearly labeled as such in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   That is because producers of some of those shows' dramatic
``caught on tape'' segments were themselves caught on tape by
sharp-eyed investigate reporters at the syndicated news magazine
program ``Inside Edition.'' In a segment broadcast on Monday,
``Inside Edition'' showed how producers had staged re-creations of
the police capturing criminals and of an elephant attacking a
photographer in Kenya, and had passed off the re-creations as real.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident from ``World's Wildest Police Videos,'' viewers
saw a boat chase, purportedly captured by a police camera, with the
suspects beaching their boat and one suspect being tackled by
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Inside Edition'' reporter, Matt Meagher, then interviewed
someone he described as ``a respected local fireman,'' who told
him: ``They needed somebody to play a criminal and a bad guy, and
so we just volunteered.'' He added, ``They went ahead and gave us a
script and told us that this is what happened and to re-enact as
best we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Meagher interviewed the program's host, a former Oregon sheriff,
John Bunnell, who said that only a few incidents were staged, and
that he tried to use the words ``police training video'' in
describing them. He also said that his show was entertainment and
should not be held to the same standards as a news program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many viewers don't make a distinction between a reality show
and a news magazine show,'' said Marc Rosenweig, senior vice
president for programming and production, East Coast, for King
World, the syndicator of ``Inside Edition.'' ``One reason is that
we in news magazines started running these `caught on tape' clips a
decade ago _ authentic ones.''
</P>
<P>
   That experience led ``Inside Edition'' to catch the reality-show
producers in their deceptions. Rosenweig said a producer had
watched several of the reality shows and had become suspicious
because of the multiple camera angles used.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew it was impossible to have the four or five camera
angles they had if it was real,'' he said. ``A real chase would
usually have just one camera, mounted in a police car or somewhere
else, or maybe a surveillance camera in a workplace or store or
something. Knowing what we all know about production, this producer
said we ought to look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenweig added that Fox was not the only network victimized by
such techniques; he had seen cable programs with similar stunts, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The specials are produced for Fox by independent companies. But
in its statement Monday, Fox said that the producers ``must adhere
to'' its policy ``to clearly identify all re-creations,
re-enactments and training videos.''

<P>
   Leaving Public TV
</P>
<P>
   The Public Broadcasting Service has lost its chief programming
executive, Kathy Quattrone, to a new venture of Discovery
Communications, a multimedia company called Discovery Health Media
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Quattrone, who worked at PBS for 20 years and headed its
programming division for almost four years, the move is a chance to
join a new kind of company ``at the ground floor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Health is developing a cable channel (to start Aug.
2), a health portal on the Internet (to start June 28), interactive
television, videos for home and professional use and a publishing
unit. She will supervise all these services as senior vice
president for programming and production, reporting to the
company's president, John Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health is both one of the most global and one of the most
personal subjects,'' Ms. Quattrone said Tuesday. ``There are a lot
of opportunities to get people information in a number of different
ways they can use.''
</P>
<P>
   But for PBS, the move adds anxiety to a beleaguered department,
and adds a hefty workload to John Wilson, Ms. Quattrone's top
deputy, who will take over for her on an interim basis. He is
already shouldering the job of chief of children's programming, one
of PBS's most important divisions. The director of that division,
Alice Cahn, left last summer to join the Children's Television
Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quattrone, who was praised within the public broadcasting
system for the way she got stations around the country to agree to
carry prime-time programs simultaneously, also had helped Ms. Cahn
add many lively programs to the PBS children's menu and had been
leading PBS's conversion to digital television.
</P>
<P>
   During her tenure, PBS chief executive Ervin Duggan pointed out
in a memo to stations, ``PBS programs earned an extraordinary
number of prestigious awards, dominating the Peabodys, the du
Ponts, the daytime Emmys and the news and documentary Emmys.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for a successor will begin shortly, said a PBS
spokesman.

one as timely as it is troubling. He is a former Green Beret, West
Point psychology professor and now a widely quoted expert on how
soldiers are taught to kill. Those same methods, he says, are also
being employed on our children through the debased images of

 &HT;        SPECTER WANTS NFL AND MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TO PAY FOR HALF
OF STADIUMS   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, May 4 -- The National Football League or Major
League Baseball would have to pay for half the construction costs
of any new stadium, under a bill introduced today in the Senate by
Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is necessary because baseball and football
have for too long had a public-be-damned attitude,'' said Specter,
R-PA. ``Major League sports is out of control on franchise moves
for football teams and the demands upon cities and states for
exorbitant construction costs is a form of legalized extortion in
major league sports.'' If the bill passes, it would have the
leagues pay 50 percent of construction or renovation costs of
stadiums, with the team owner and public each paying 25 percent.
The bill would require the NFL and Major League baseball to place
10 percent of its television revenues into a trust fund. That
money, would pay for half the cost of construction or renovation of
ballparks and stadiums if the local government agrees to pay one
dollar for every two trust fund dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said the problem of the high costs of stadium
construction is especially acute in Pennsylvania, where there are
four projects underway with a more than $1 billion dollar price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Two stadiums are under construction in Western Pennsylvania for
the Pirates and Steelers, and two more are being sought in Eastern
Pennsylvania for the Eagles and Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of sports franchises to their owners has ballooned
in recent years,'' Specter said. ``These revenues are shared by the
club and their players. One would think some of that giant revenue
windfall might trickle down and be used to help finance new
ballparks and stadiums, which produce greatly enhanced revenues for
team owners, yet it seems the more network TV money a league makes,
the more its clubs demand from local taxpayers to fund the
construction of new playing facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also extend an anti-trust exemption to give the
authority to the NFL to deny a member club's request to move its
franchise to a different city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe a federal law of this type is necessary,''
said Joe Browne, a spokesman for the NFL. ``Its players have
contributed hundreds of millions of dollars for public-private
partnerships and stadium projects throughout the 1990s. We
anticipate contributing additional substantial revenues to future
stadiums.'' Major League Baseball did not return phone calls.

 &HT;    STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS SUPPORT BILL TO PROTECT STATE TOBACCO
SETTLEMENTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bolstered by state and local officials, a
bipartisan group of senators Tuesday urged Congress to bar the
federal government from seizing any portion of the nearly $250
billion in tobacco settlements with states or dictating how the
money must be used.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations representing the nation's governors, mayors, state
legislatures, counties and cities joined Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and George Voinovich, R-Ohio, to
support adding the proposed legislation to an emergency
appropriations bill designed to aid domestic and international
victims of last fall's hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to see final action early this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, R-Utah, said a recent poll indicated
that citizens would rather see state governments -- instead of the
federal government -- decide how to spend tobacco settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Clarence Anthony of South Bay, Fla., president of the
National League of Cities, urged Congress to allow the tobacco
money to be spent by the government ``that is closest to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the Clinton administration's claim that the federal
government -- which contributes to state Medicaid payments -- is
entitled to about 60 percent of the state tobacco settlements. The
actual amount would vary from state to state. In Florida it would
be about 55 percent.

<P>
   The nation's major tobacco companies have agreed to pay the
states nearly $250 billion over the next quarter century. Florida
and Texas settled separate suits -- Florida for $13 billion, Texas
for $15.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a former governor, said the federal government is not
entitled to the money because the settlements came in response to
state suits. Congressional efforts to dictate how the money should
be spent is based on an arrogant view that the federal government
is more responsible than state governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the states are acting responsibly,'' Graham
said. ``We don't have to assume that the states require the federal
government to hold their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said that if Congress dictates how the tobacco money
should be spent, each state would have to get federal approval
before it could spend any settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   Without assurances that states can spend the money as they
choose, she said programs aimed at children's health and smoking
cessation could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, another former governor, said state and local
officials can do a better job of targeting where the money should
be spent than federal officials. ``So often people in Washington
think that they know more about local people than state and local
governments.''

 &HT;    STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS SUPPORT BILL TO PROTECT STATE TOBACCO
SETTLEMENTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bolstered by state and local officials, a
bipartisan group of senators Tuesday urged Congress to bar the
federal government from seizing any portion of the nearly $250
billion in tobacco settlements with states or dictating how the
money must be used.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations representing the nation's governors, mayors, state
legislatures, counties and cities joined Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and George Voinovich, R-Ohio, to
support adding the proposed legislation to an emergency
appropriations bill designed to aid domestic and international
victims of last fall's hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to see final action early this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, R-Utah, said a recent poll indicated
that citizens would rather see state governments -- instead of the
federal government -- decide how to spend tobacco settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Clarence Anthony of South Bay, Fla., president of the
National League of Cities, urged Congress to allow the tobacco
money to be spent by the government ``that is closest to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the Clinton administration's claim that the federal
government -- which contributes to state Medicaid payments -- is
entitled to about 60 percent of the state tobacco settlements. The
actual amount would vary from state to state. In Florida it would
be about 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's major tobacco companies have agreed to pay the
states nearly $250 billion over the next quarter century. Florida
and Texas settled separate suits -- Florida for $13 billion, Texas
for $15.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a former governor, said the federal government is not

   KOSOVO-PRISTINA (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ Serbs and a few
Albanians are trickling back to Pristina, Kosovo's capital. The
sunny daytime streets, with a few pedestrians and shoppers, now
display a poor imitation of ordinary life, so long as one doesn't
focus too hard on the empty, looted Albanian districts, the bomb
damage and the nearly total lack of children in the town. By Steven
Erlanger. 1,700 words.
</P>
<P>
   EVEREST (Undated) _ The discovery of a body high on the slopes
of Mount Everest reported to be George Mallory, who disappeared in
1924, raises anew speculation on whether he reached the summit,
beating Edmund Hillary, credited with Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing
Norgay with being the first to reach the top in 1953. By
Christopher S. Wren.

   NY-LOUIMA-TRIAL (New York) _ Describing the graphic details of a

   CUBA-DEFECT (Washington) _ The game ended around midnight on
Monday, and for the next few hours, the Cuban baseball team and
their band of noisy supporters continued celebrating a 12-6 victory
over the Baltimore Orioles in the hotel where the team and its
300-member delegation were staying. But when the group made a hasty
departure from the Baltimore-Washington International Airport for
Havana, at least seven members of the traveling party were missing.

   TV-HOME-IMPROVEMENT (Los Angeles) _ Compare the last episode of
``Seinfeld'' with the recent taping of the final episode of ``Home
Improvement,'' a prime-time hit on ABC for the past eight seasons.
After a tearful Tim Allen, the star, told a joke for a cast and
crew drenched in tears, they taped a slightly maudlin story,
scheduled to air on May 25, in which Allen's character reaffirms
his love for his wife and family, and his loyal sidekick finds the
love that had long eluded him, lending the closing a poignant moral
gravity. The episode is touching, and a historical relic, as the
traditional family sitcom goes the way of the western. By James
Sterngold. 1,587 words.

 &HT;    CNN gets into web shopping
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ These are the two key factors behind that nifty black
``Shop(at)CNN'' icon in the right hand corner of every CNN.com
page. First, online shopping is hotter than hot. Second, analysts
say Web surfers don't mind seeing ads for BellSouth, Fidelity
Investments or Toyota mixed in with news and other information
sites.
</P>
<P>
   This is all the information you need to know to understand the
reason for the debut of the mini-shopping section, dubbed
``Shop(at)CNN'' which offers users the opportunity to engage in a
little electronic commerce while catching up on the news of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Shop(at)CNN retailers include Barnes and Noble, FlowerClub, the
TotalE online music store, the Internet Travel Network and Staples.
There are five categories now, but CNN says it plans to eventually
have 16.
</P>
<P>
   Users who click on the Shop icon, will see a smaller browser
window open up within the CNN window, so there won't be any
confusion about whether you are reading news or shopping. Should
you decide to browse, the window will expand to full size, but if
you close the window, the CNN site will still be right there
waiting for you.
</P>
<P>
   The caliber of retailers CNN has recruited may make Shop(at)CNN
a feature users like. In addition it's also an excellent ``sticky
product'' that will keep users dallying on the CNN site longer than
they might otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   On the sales side, CNN is hoping the site will draw more
advertisers to the site and promises to deliver an upscale audience
of news junkies who will spend money on books, CD's, office
supplies and videos.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bernstein, CNN senior vice president and general manager,
CNN Interactive, says research shows that CNN users are 141 percent
more likely than the average Web user to make an online purchase.
It's a clever an unobtrusive concept that should add value to users
and generate revenue for CNN.

<P>
   MUSIC-CONTRACTS (Undated) _ A slew of recent events _ from the
panic at major labels over the distribution of music on the
Internet to the blood-letting following large music company mergers
_ has made it clear to musicians that the structure of major record
companies is not conducive to either their financial or, more
important, their artistic goals. Talking to everyone from
up-and-coming bands to those who have been signed for more than a
decade, from artists with low sales to superstars, from lawyers to
former executives, there is a growing dissatisfaction with a system
that has been building its fortress for more than 100 years _ since
a company called Columbia sprung up to challenge Thomas Edison's
exclusive distribution of prerecorded cylinders to be played on the
phonograph he invented. By Neil Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THREE-SEASONS-FILM (Undated) _ The Vietnamese film by Tony Bui,
``Three Seasons,'' opened in New York on April 30 and will open
nationwide on Friday. It is the first American feature film to
attempt a portrait of contemporary postwar Vietnam, poised on the
brink of modernity. ``Three Seasons,'' which landed a major
American star, (Harvey Keitel who has been known to be partial to
small, independent films), is an interweaving of three stories and
operates on several narrative levels: past and present, personal
and national, realistic and poetic. By Laura Winters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH-FRANZ-THEATER (New York) _ Some people say there has
never been a Linda like that of Elizabeth Franz as Willy Loman's
wife in ``Death of a Salesman.'' The play's author is one of them.
Speaking of the actress's portrayal in the 50th-anniversary
production now on Broadway, Arthur Miller said, ``She has
discovered in the role the basic underlying powerful
protectiveness, which comes out as fury, and that in the past, in
every performance I know of, was simply washed out.'' By Dinitia
Smith. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONTE-CAROLO-BALLET (Undated) _ With its Mediterranean vistas
and posh casinos, the little principality of Monaco has reigned for
generations as a playground for the rich and famous. It's not all
fun and games, though, for Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, a local
troupe that spent 48 weeks rehearsing and performing last year. Led
by Jean-Christophe Maillot, an amiable young Frenchman with big
ambitions, this 14-year-old company is striving to reconcile its
loyalty to tradition with a passion for something new. It seems
fitting that the company will take up this theme when it opens a
weeklong season at City Center in Manhattan on Wednesday. By
Christopher Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   BEBE-MILLER-DANCE (New York) _ The choreographer Bebe Miller,
wearing baggy black pants and a simple black shirt, took a position
in front of the wall-length mirror. A compact woman with
dreadlocks, she faced front, then side, then back, and front again,
allowing herself to be scrutinized. Over a tape recording came her
mellow voice. ``Who is looking for gay men in the group?'' The
questions are aimed at her audiences. ``Who is counting the white
people?'' ``How important is it that these dancers work for a black
choreographer?'' The dancers remained lost in their own worlds
until a gentle rap by the Fugees started up. They then fell into
loose, silky movements. ``This section represents a party,'' Ms.
Miller reminded them. ``Don't be so serious.'' But this 60-minute
piece, ``Going to the Wall,'' which premiered at Dartmouth College
last year, is very serious. It will have its New York premiere on
Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, beginning a weeklong engagement, its
first in three years. By Valerie Gladstone. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MCDUFFIE-MUSIC (Undated) _ A lot of musicians these days are
already starting international careers before they have completed
the early stages of professional development, so that they find
themselves putting their clothes on in public. Into such a world
suddenly comes Robert McDuffie, 40, a violinist fully and
impeccably dressed, ready to make his New York Philharmonic debut
on Thursday evening at Avery Fisher Hall after nearly two decades
of giving coconcerts. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   MUSICALS-MELODIES (Undated) _ The story creaks, the characters
are stereotypes from another time, the theatrical style doesn't
work on modern audiences, but oh, that music. It is as fresh as on
the day it was born. Surely we're talking about ``La Sonnambula''
or one of its bel canto opera pals, but what about ``Annie Get Your
Gun,'' a musical pulled forcibly from the past and now running
strong at the Marquis Theater on Broadway? Vincenzo Bellini and
Irving Berlin have more things in common than you think: not least,
an infallible gift for melody. By Bernard Holland. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GILBERTO-GIL-MUSIC (Undated) _ Gilberto Gil, like Caetano
Veloso, Os Mutantes and Carlinhos Brown, comes from the Brazilian
state of Bahia. If the Brazilian-music fetishism of the moment
centers too heavily on that northern region (and especially on the
late 60s Tropicalia movement), it doesn't change the fact that
``Ensaio Geral,'' a 12-CD set of early work by Gil, is an
extraordinary document _ a tracking of a distinctly Bahian but also
fairly universal pop artist's growth and achievement. By Ben
Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ST-JOHN-CATHEDRAL-ART (New York) _ The history of the quarries
of Vinalhaven Island, Maine, and specifically, the erection of
eight monumental columns in the St. John the Divine Cathedral's
sanctuary, are the subject of an exhibition lining the cathedral's
photography wall. ``The Eight Columns of Worship: A Tribute to
Human Ingenuity and Faith,'' tells the story behind the buildings
that stand as a testament to the majesty and endurance of
Vinalhaven granite. By Kathryn Shattuck. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GLASGOW-ARCHITECTURE (Glasgow, Scotland) _ Glasgow, which was
named the United Kingdom's City of Architecure and Design for 1999,
is looking to the future as much as reveling in the past. Through
the end of the year, it is devoting itself to architecture and
design through a program called Glasgow 1999, a dizzying array of
more than 300 exhibits, building projects, competitions,
conferences, educational programs and special events. The $62.7
million program, though wide ranging, is placing particular
emphasis on the way architecture and design affect and shape
everyday life. The By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   HUNGARY-PHOTOGRAPHERS (Undated) _ At the turn of the century,
Hungary was the most photo-obsessed country in the world. Princes
and princesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire frequented photo
exhibitions and proudly displayed their own prints. From a nation
the size of Indiana emerged many of the leading names of modern
photography, including Andre Kertesz, Brassai, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy
and Robert Capa. But four decades of Communist rule isolated
Hungarian photography from this artistic heritage, from the outside
world and from many of its subjects. Now, at the turn of a new
century, Hungarian photographers are struggling to rebuild that
tradition. A series of exhibitions of Hungarian photography is now
on view at the Hungarian Consulate in New York City. By Lyler
Rexer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NAKASHIMA-FURNITURE-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Like most collectors of
George Nakashima's furniture, Ms. Victoria Fiore, a former opera
singer who worked 15 years as a recepitionist for the furniture
designer, did not just buy a handful of pieces to use as design
accents; she filled her home with his work. Installing Nakashima
tables, chairs, cabinets, bedroom sets and more, she created a
total environment out of his elegant wood furniture, notable for
their angular bases topped with primitive slabs of wood displaying
grain patterns and naturally craggy edges. Last Sunday, the entire
collection _ save for the first stool Ms. Fiore bought _ was sold
for more than $170,000, roughly three times the presale estimate,
at David Rago Modern Auctions in Lambertville, N.J., one of the
primary auctioneers of Nakashima furniture. By Elizabeth Hayt.

 &HT;    Cox to offer bill-paying via CheckFree
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a first for the cable TV industry, Cox
Communications will use the electronic banking services of
Atlanta-based CheckFree to allow its customers to receive monthly
statements and pay their bills via computer.
</P>
<P>
   The service will be available to all of Cox Communications' 3.8
million subscribers nationwide as of Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The service would work in two ways. Customers could pay their
bills through a CheckFree Web site called E-Bill and located at
www.mybills.com/ebill. Or they could pay bills through electronic
banking software such as Quicken or Microsoft Money.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also represents the first time the company's customers
can receive and pay for a variety of new services in one statement.
The electronic statement would include fees for both cable TV and
telephone service _ but not yet for high-speed access to the
Internet. Cox now offers in nationwide markets these services:
cable TV, local and long-distance telephone service and high-speed
access to the Internet through cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this agreement, Cox Communications demonstrates
innovation in meeting customer needs and delivering leading
technology among providers of communications services,'' said Scott
Hatfield, Cox Communications' chief information officer.
</P>
<P>
   Cox represents the 49th big corporate customer that has signed
up to use CheckFree's system. CheckFree has 2.8 million customers
using its electronic banking services. Its software is the backbone
of the electronic banking systems of SunTrust and First Union, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is controlled by Atlanta-based media
conglomerate Cox Enterprises Inc.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ And Dot Com it is.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM Internet Health today will change its name to Adam.com
Inc., solidifying its Internet identity as it announces another
deal aimed at propelling the company to the front of the pack in
Net healthcare information.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM, originally ADAM Software, this week landed a deal that
will put its content _ including more than 4,000 medical topics _
on Netscape Netcenter, a portal that leads Net users to a variety
of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is an extension of a previous agreement with Excite,
the search engine used on Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is another step toward making Adam.com the leader
in consumer health information on the Internet,'' said Chairman and
Chief Executive Robert Cramer Jr.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Adam would have to outpace a local rival _ WebMD
Inc., which has announced a series of high-profile partnerships,
including a $220 million investment from DuPont. WebMD has
announced its intent for a public offering of stock, a move that
has already drawn much investor interest.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Adam has until recently been struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Founded a decade ago, Adam was for a long time a premier maker
of software and CD-ROMs with medical diagrams and information.
Although its reputation for quality remained solid, the company hit
some tough times several years ago, suffering losses and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has changed that, Cramer said. In addition to
putting Adam content on the Excite and Netcenter sites, the deals
will put links back to Adam on those sites, he said. ``Now we have
a distribution system that will allow us to reach tens of millions
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Netcenter and Excite deals Adam has an agreement
with the CNN Networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Adam receives a fee for providing its content, while others
pay for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is significantly different and significantly
better,'' Cramer said. ``The difference is that we own our content.
I think content ownership is key.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, which has a partnership with Adam, paid $52 million to be
featured on the Lycos network.
</P>
<P>
   Adam has apparently been noticed by investors. Company stock,
which languished in the doldrums for much of last year, has lately
come alive.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting a 52-week low of $2.25 a share in November, Adam
increased in value by more than 400 percent by Monday when it
closed at $12.
</P>
<P>
   Adam on Tuesday sipped 75 cents a share to close at $11.25.

 &HT;    Lines may be shorter at neighborhood bank branches
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When was the last time you walked into your bank?
</P>
<P>
   If success stories like Net.B(at)nk and new Internet ventures by
traditional bankers like Synovus Financial are any indication, foot
traffic in traditional bank branches may continue to dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 17 of the 100 largest banks offered their customers
the ability to turn their PCs into ATMs, to look up their account
balances and transfer funds online. This year, 22 more banks
started offering those services, said Chris Musto, a research
analyst with Gomez Advisors, a Massachusetts firm that studies
financial services on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable that in the near future, a bank customer will
have his paycheck direct deposited, get and pay bills
electronically, make withdrawals from an ATM and transfer funds
between accounts by telephone. None of which require a visit to the
neighborhood bank.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have offered their customers the option of paying bills
through their PC software for years.
</P>
<P>
   But Alpharetta, Ga.-based Net.B(at)nk is one of a handful of
banks _ Atlanta's Security First Network Bank and Virginia-based
TeleBank among them _ that have taken ultimate advantage of the
Internet's efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   By operating mostly as an Internet-only bank, Net.B(at)nk,
Security First Network Bank and TeleBank are able to save the money
it costs to build and staff branches. Some of that savings is
passed on to customers in the form of higher interest rates on
accounts. Last week, Security First Network Bank announced a
introductory interest rate of 6 percent for a checking account,
almost four times the national average, according to Bank Rate
Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has noticed. Shares of Net.B(at)nk and TeleBank hit
52-week highs in April. Net.B(at)nk shares are up 529 percent for
1999. TeleBank's stock has increased 164 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, traditional banks are seeing the potential. Last month,
Sovereign Bancorp, North Fork Bancorp and Synovus Financial
announced they are filing for separately chartered, Internet-only
banks. Synovus plans to have an Internet-mostly bank that will be
able to offer lower rates than its traditional bank cousin by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet-only bank is a more efficient option,'' said
James D. Yancey, Synovus Financial president. ``You can't compete
from a price standpoint with an Internet-only bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Yancey said it costs about $1.5 million to open a traditional
branch in typical Synovus markets. He said setting up and running
Synovus' Internet-only bank will cost about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Musto, of Gomez Advisors, has been rating the online banking
services every three months for the last year.
</P>
<P>
   He said the traditional banks are starting to open separately
chartered Internet-mostly branches for defensive and offensive
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a green field strategy,'' he said. ``How do you
cope with a potential disruption from doing business and at the
same time plant the seeds of future growth? And for the Internet
bank, it gives them access to the power and the leverage of the
overall firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Musto said the so-called ``branchless'' banks are still small by
traditional bank standards. TeleBank has about 50,000 accounts,
Net.B(at)nk has about 30,000, Security First Network Bank has less
than 16,000. Wells Fargo, on the other hand, has 820,000 customers
doing their banking online. The San Francisco-based bank added
164,000 in the first three months of this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bruene, Online Banking Report editor, said banks also are
chartering Internet-mostly banks because the market is hot.
</P>
<P>
   Net.B(at)nk started as an online venture by Carolina First Bank
that paid off and set an example, Bruene said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carolina First's gain on paper from Net.B(at)nk stock is in
the tens of million of dollars and that's before the stock went
whacko,'' he said. ``It was an incredible grand slam for them. If
you're a bank, you look at that and say, 'Wow. How can we do
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bruene said synovusbank.com should do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a wonderful medium for financial services.
It's such an ideal way for customers and a financial institution to
interact.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruene said he does not see the branch disappearing altogether.
People still like to know there are humans connected to all the
technology to which they trust their money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you see a lot less square feet devoted to banking,''
Bruene said. ``In California, they are starting to ration the
branch system. You see kiosks inside grocery stores as opposed to
12,000 square-feet on the corner. There's still a human. But all
you need is a kiosk. You don't need that huge monument. Unless the
people want to pay for them. It's up to us to decide.''

INTERNET FRENZY HITS HONG KONG MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Investors here are usually entranced by tycoons
rather than technology. Put them together, though, and it can whip
up a high-tech frenzy to rival the Nasdaq as its frothiest.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Tricom Holdings Ltd., a telecommunications
provider that labored in obscurity until Tuesday, when Richard Li
announced a plan to take it over and turn it into a vehicle for his
Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Tricom's stock went on a wild ride, multiplying in value by as
much as 24 times before closing at $1.83 (Hong Kong), or 23 cents
(U.S.). That was a 1,246 percent increase from its previous closing
price. Although Tricom trades at penny-stock levels, about $240
million worth of the shares changed hands, making it the most
active issue on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a frenzy about anything that's Internet-related,
regardless of what the business is,'' said Joseph Locke, a
telecommunications analyst at ABN Amro. ``The Hong Kong market
doesn't seem to make a distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tricom's case, the business may matter less than its backer.
Li is the son of the legendary Hong Kong tycoon, Li Ka-shing. He is
trying to become a high-tech version of his father, with plans to
build a $2 billion technology park in Hong Kong and a satellite
service that will deliver Internet access across Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Li's announcement that he would fold his technology ventures
into Tricom and rename it Pacific Century Cyberworks was enough to
create Hong Kong's equivalent of Netscape Communications _ a stock
that takes off like a rocket on little more than the vague promise
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a piece of good news for Hong Kong,'' said Alexander
Arena, who will be managing director of the new company. ``There's
obviously a pent-up demand for these kinds of stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tricom is not the only Hong Kong company to be caught in the
Internet frenzy. Earlier this year, two local telephone providers,
Hong Kong Telecom and Smartone Telecommunications Holdings Ltd.,
announced Internet deals with Microsoft and Yahoo, respectively.
Though the announcements were notably short of details, they turned
both companies into shooting stars.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the insatiable demand for technology stocks has
helped fuel the remarkable rally in the Hong Kong market, which has
risen more than 20 percent since March. On Tuesday, the Hang Seng
Index rose 223 points, closing at 13,559. During the morning
session, when Tricom was at its peak, the Hang Seng hit 13,690 _
its highest level since before the market crash in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Hong Kong would seem to be fertile ground for an
Internet business. More than 15 percent of people here have
personal computers and about 10 percent subscribe to an online
service.
</P>
<P>
   But other so-called broadband services have failed to take root.
Hong Kong Telecom, the territory's largest Internet service
provider, started an interactive television service in March 1998.
The service, called iTV, fell far short of its target of 250,000
subscribers by the end of its first year.
</P>
<P>
   In teaming up with Microsoft, Hong Kong Telecom said its goal
was to create entertainment, information and business services that
would be transmitted over its network to personal computers and
televisions. Microsoft's participation is not exclusive, however,
and there is no guarantee it will work with Hong Kong Telecom
beyond the 90-day development period.
</P>
<P>
   Because Li developed Star TV, Asia's first and largest
satellite-delivered cable television service, analysts here are
prepared to give the 32-year-old entrepreneur the benefit of the
doubt on this new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies in Hong Kong are way behind the curve in the
Internet,'' said Mac Overton, an independent portfolio manager.
``If you believe Richard Li has a game plan and is ahead of the
curve, this company could become the Amazon.com or Cisco of the
Asia region.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Li is guarded about what assets Pacific Century
Cyberworks will contain. Arena said, for example, that Li would
contribute the planned satellite Internet service only if he
obtained the approval of his joint venture partner, Intel Corp. The
same is true of Cyberport, a $2 billion technology park that Li is
building with the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberport has set off a rancorous controversy here, as rival
property developers have accused the government of donating prime
real estate to Li for a project that will include lucrative
residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about cyberspace, some experts said that buying
shares of Tricom was a cheap way to participate in a real estate
deal. Investors in Hong Kong have rarely been able to pass up that
kind of opportunity.

 &HT;    BellSouth adding virtual service
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The idea is in the name: virtual assistant.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the phone line is the disembodied voice of
woman, sounding somewhere over 30. She is friendly but not perky.
Polite but not intimate. Efficient but not Prussian, she reads you
your e-mail and voice mail, helps update your calendar.
</P>
<P>
   You suggest a response to this or that message. She assures you
it will be sent.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally she asks you to repeat a command, but generally the
conversation flows smoothly. Perhaps you are interrupted, so you
ask her to wait. She wordlessly waits until you are done, then is
instantly ready for your next summons.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, you may forget that your assistant is actually a
bundle of software code, connected to a sizable database residing
on a computer server in California.
</P>
<P>
   This virtual assistant is the latest version of Portico from
California-based General Magic. Until now, it has been available
only through resellers, but BellSouth on Tuesday became the first
phone company to piggyback the service on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Some BellSouth wireless customers can get it now as part of a
trial, while Portico _ which will probably be given a different
name for purposes of BellSouth marketing _ will be generally
available next month.
</P>
<P>
   Portico can be used from a land-line phone or via the Internet's
Web, but it is perhaps not an accident that its first offering is
to BellSouth's wireless customers only.
</P>
<P>
   Portico is meant to give BellSouth another lure in the effort to
retain the high-end customers of wireless service _ something that
the company has lacked. Mostly mobile professionals, many of those
big-spending customers have been drawn to AT&AMP;T, Sprint or even
Nextel. Companies that have national presence can offer calling
plans that treat calls the same whether they are made in Marietta,
Ga. or Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, whose wireless service is mainly in the Southeast and
has only recently started to fight back, announced one-rate plans
pitched at customers who travel _ and use a lot of wireless phone
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that this is a tool for people who are
mobile,'' said BellSouth spokeswoman Kristie Madara. ``It is aimed
toward mobile professionals who mostly would be using it on a
wireless phone.''
</P>
<P>
   At $30 a month _ not much less than an average monthly cellular
bill _ it is clearly not aimed at a casual consumer. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a mass consumer product yet,'' Madara said. ``This is
the first step to see how customers react to things like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Meisel, president of TMA Associates and editor of Speech
Recognition Update, said he thinks BellSouth's offering will start
off a bit pricey. And Portico's Web capabilities lag behind the
best desktop personal information managers.
</P>
<P>
   But its voice-recognition power is substantial, and the
potential market for telephone assistance is huge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Internet sites known as portals, a phone assistant will
eventually be seen as a gateway to various kinds of information and
services, he said. For instance, Portico already can be programmed
to call a user with selected stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from similar phone services could surpass $1 billion
next year and then double the year after, Meisel said. ``I think I
may have been a little optimistic about how fast it will take off,
but I think that it will grow very rapidly once it is broadly
introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   A Portico user can choose among several different voices, from a
hard-driving male to the low-key woman that General Magic used this
week in a demonstration. The voices have been created with
profiles, general identities meant to be implicitly carried in the
sound of the voice and to appeal to the real human customers at the
other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange as it sounds, people bond with it,'' said Andre
Nakaso, director of business development for General Magic.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few good business reasons for that. First, a
customer who begins to think of the virtual assistant as a person
is less apt to dump the service. And switching to a competing
service should become harder than just switching phones. That is,
if the customer thinks of this less as a product than a
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The $30-a-month rate for Portico will permit unlimited use. But
of course, if the customer enjoys talking to the virtual assistant,
that could very well translate to more time on the wireless phone _
which would likely mean higher revenue for BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between General Magic and BellSouth means Portico
will not be offered in any markets in which BellSouth has a
wireless business. And with the service, General Magic and
BellSouth are combining several key elements seen by analysts as
the next technology wave.
</P>
<P>
   First is the notion of voice-enabled computing, which has been
kicking around various labs for decades. Yet in recent years the
technology has taken tremendous strides, with the best-known
products coming from IBM, Philips and Dragon Software.
</P>
<P>
   A bevy of techno-gurus has also predicted the coming of
``pervasive computing,'' in which computers will be linked to
myriad functions in everyday life. Already, computers dominate
automotive technology.
</P>
<P>
   Combining voice-enable technology with the desire to put
computers in our homes and soon people will perform all sorts of
tasks from afar, from starting the oven to turning on an alarm
system.
</P>
<P>
   Portico stops short of that but has taken the first large step:
unified messaging. The idea is one of convenience, that most people
would like access to e-mail, voice mail and faxes all through one
source.
</P>
<P>
   General Magic is not the only company that has noticed the
potential in these markets. For instance, Atlanta-based Premier
Technologies uses software from Intellivoice to build a system for
unified messaging.
</P>
<P>
   But General Magic's Portico talks to you. Perhaps as
importantly, it listens to you and _ if all goes well _ it does
what you say.
</P>
<P>
   Portico is programmed to respond to ``grammar,'' to phrases,
expressions and sentences and not just single words. That means it
can respond to more than 2 million different phrases and is not
bothered by ``ummms, ahhs, wouldja or couldja,'' Nakaso said.
</P>
<P>
   But ask something incoherent or otherwise outside her job
skills, and that woman's voice at the other end of the line will
not answer. The virtual assistant is not supposed to respond to
non-business conversation or personal questions.
</P>
<P>
   So there is no point in asking her for even a virtual date.

<P>
   ARAM, West Bank _ If Tuesday had turned out to be the ``sacred
date'' that Yasser Arafat had promised, Artistic Studio Co. here
would have been cranking out Palestinian flags, stickers and
T-shirts by the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Samir Joubeh, an owner, would have had no time to sip hot coffee
laced with cardamom. The three workers who listlessly silkscreened
tank tops would have had the company of a dozen more laborers. And
the machines would have been buzzing with the business of
Palestinian statehood, not with Adidas knockoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no May 4,'' Joubeh said. ``There is no business.
And, most significantly, there is no Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Arafat took May 4 off the Palestinian calendar. For
months he had been promising to declare a state in the West Bank
and Gaza on this date, when final-status peace talks were supposed
to have been completed under the terms of the Oslo peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the final talks have barely begun and, bowing to
international pressure, Arafat and the Palestinian leadership have
recommitted themselves to the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian National Authority decreed that Tuesday would be
a normal workday, and it was. Arafat traveled abroad as usual.
There were a few small protest marches. In Hebron, Palestinians who
marched brandishing weapons clashed with Israeli police; 17 were
wounded, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Israeli government that made the day into a moment _
its moment: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a news
conference to take credit for Arafat's ``backing off'' a unilateral
declaration of a Palestinian state ``with Jerusalem as its
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he understood that our response would be very firm,''
said Netanyahu, flanked by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and
Defense Minister Moshe Arens.
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian daily newspaper Al Quds, a political cartoon
Tuesday showed a calendar with an annotation May 4: ``Never mind.''
</P>
<P>
   On a small scale a battle over Jerusalem's fate, a particularly
thorny issue, took place late Tuesday afternoon in a small corner
of the city. There was a potential for volatile clashes, but
Israeli police officers formed a tight buffer between two
gatherings _ one Palestinian, one Jewish _ a few blocks apart.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the American Colony Hotel, several hundred
Palestinians gathered to defend Orient House, which was draped with
a giant Palestinian flag. Orient House is a Palestinian institution
that the Netanyahu government has threatened to close, saying it
operates illegally.
</P>
<P>
   And on the other side of the hotel, thousands of religious Jews
converged on the tomb of a holy man both to celebrate Lag b'Omer, a
minor holiday, and to mark their attempt to reclaim Sheik Jarrah, a
Palestinian neighborhood, for Jews.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the divide, there were fiery speeches in Arabic
asserting Palestinian claims to Jerusalem, accompanied by the
bagpipe music that is customary at formal Palestinian events.
Israeli police officers guarded the gates, chasing away the handful
of Israelis who cruised by in cars, shouting insults in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, in the heart of a Palestinian neighborhood,
crowds of Jews gathered in a rocky field beneath three huge Israeli
flags. The flags crowned the rooftops of houses that three Jewish
couples and six yeshiva students have recently settled as part of a
campaign to re-establish a Jewish presence there.
</P>
<P>
   A banner in Hebrew read, ``Jerusalem United Forever,'' and a
popular Hasidic musician, Mordechai Ben David, performed. His
albums include ``Jerusalem Is Not for Sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Palestinian nor the Israeli gathering was ostensibly
connected to the May 4 date. But it permeated both events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of turned into a party to celebrate the end of
Oslo,'' said Judy Balint, an organizer of the Jewish event. ``The
Oslo agreement is dust, if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian agreement negotiated in Oslo laid out an
interim period that hard-liners on both sides believe to be over,
canceling everything agreed to. But both sides have extended their
commitment to the accord.
</P>
<P>
   It is less than two weeks before the Israeli elections, and in
warrior campaign mode, Netanyahu and his key ministers kept
swinging Tuesday even though Tuesday's fight was over.
</P>
<P>
   They warned of retaliation _ annexation of West Bank land, a
cutoff of Oslo-mandated tax payments to the Palestinians _ should
Arafat contemplate a unilateral declaration of statehood in the
future. But Netanyahu also made it clear that even negotiated
Palestinian statehood, which polls show most Israelis would accept,
is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could bring in weapons, missiles, planes, tanks,
artillery,'' Netanyahu said. ``It could make military pacts with
other countries, like Iran and Iraq. It could build terror bases to
a greater extent, on our doorstep, at the edge of our homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's opponents criticized his news conference.

   ``What we saw was a propaganda show, which is designed to turn
what in my opinion is the greatest failure in the history of
Israeli foreign policy into an achievement,'' said Shlomo Ben Ami,
a high-ranking Labor Party official. ``We are at May 4, the
Palestinian state is an accomplished fact, and the last push to its
founding was given by Netanyahu himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Sarid, leader of the Meretz Party, asked: ``The
Palestinian state doesn't already exist? Then I don't know what a
state is. They have territory, an elected president and an elected
parliament. They have an anthem, a flag, a symbol and relations
with more than 100 countries. High-ranking visitors come and go.
They have an army that is called a police force.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, in withdrawing his pledge to declare statehood, told
Palestinians that the state more or less already exists, with broad
support abroad if not that from the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they like it or not, our state is already
established,'' Arafat told reporters Monday night, on his return
from Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   At the small flag and sticker factory in this town just outside
Jerusalem, Joubeh seemed skeptical of the claim. He said
Palestinian business people are enduring an agonizing limbo, a
complaint echoed by many in Gaza, too, who say the economy is
paralyzed because the future of the peace talks is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Joubeh showed off one of his few new products, a sign of how
closely Israelis and Palestinians are linked even in this
conflicted moment: not Palestinian flags, but bumper stickers for
Yitzhak Mordechai, a candidate for prime minister of Israel.

TRADITIONAL FAMILY TV SITCOM MAY BE A DYING BREED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Seinfeld'' was often called the prototype of the
post-modern sitcom, and so it seemed apt that the last episode
involved a strange dream sequence and a sinister finale for a group
of self-absorbed singles stumbling in an amoral world.
</P>
<P>
   Now compare that with the recent taping of the final episode of
``Home Improvement,'' a prime-time hit on ABC for the past eight
seasons. After the tearful star, Tim Allen, told a joke for a cast
and crew drenched in tears, they taped a slightly maudlin story,
scheduled to air May 25, in which Allen's character reaffirms his
love for his wife and family, and his loyal sidekick finds the love
that had long eluded him, lending the closing a poignant moral
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The episode was touching and, many people in television believe,
a historical relic, as the traditional family sitcom _ a staple of
the medium for more than four decades _ goes the way of the
western.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that show was pitched to a network today, nobody would take
it,'' lamented Matt Williams, one of the creators and an executive
producer of ``Home Improvement'' and previously a producer of
another traditional family sitcom, ``The Cosby Show.'' ``This show
was created to celebrate the American family, and I'm not sure you
can do that in the same way now.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time domestic sitcoms like ``Father Knows Best,'' ``Leave
It to Beaver,'' ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' ``The Brady Bunch'' and
even ``All in the Family'' and ``Sanford and Son'' virtually
defined television while conveying powerful images of an often
idealized if somewhat quirky middle-class existence built around
family units. Households across the United States generally had a
single television, there were only three networks, and the
experience of watching such shows was shared.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Homes frequently have many television sets; 74
percent of homes now have more than one, compared with 35 percent
in 1970. And there are scores of channels transmitting images that
have changed subtly but significantly. Singles dominate sitcoms _
shows like ``Friends,'' ``The Drew Carey Show'' or ``Ally McBeal,''
for example _ and the networks for the most part no longer even try
to attract broad audiences. Audiences are deeply divided by age and
even by race. Advertisers press the networks to pursue thin slices
of the audience _ preferably younger, affluent, white men _ and pay
dearly to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising Age, a trade publication, reports that advertisers
pay $425,000 for a 30-second spot on ``Friends,'' compared with
$210,000 for an ad on ``Home Improvement'' and just $115,000 for an
ad on ``Cosby.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most successful family sitcom still on the air is
``The Simpsons,'' Fox's animated sendup about a dysfunctional
family whose creator, Matt Groening, openly describes it as ``the
anti-Cosby show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea and delight we once took in celebrating family,
community seems to be vaporizing before us,'' said Norman Lear, the
creator of shows like ``All in the Family'' and ``The Jeffersons.''
``You now have all these shows about lone people coming together.
It seems to me this is part of something profound. It's a disease
of our time. There's a television in every room and the family has
become splintered.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the last popular domestic sitcoms is ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' on CBS. Phil Rosenthal, a creator and an executive
producer, said he faced enormous resistance from network executives
when he presented the idea several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, there was nothing about the premise of this show
that anybody at a network found attractive,'' Rosenthal said.
``They said it had to be edgier, hipper, not so family. But what
you have to realize is that this is a show about a family with
kids, but it is very much for an adult audience. It's not aimed at
the broad audiences. It's a new kind of family show, maybe an
evolutionary step.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are people who believe that while the old-style
show may be dying, there is plenty of demand for new-style family
shows. ``Perhaps it won't be a traditional family sitcom, but I
think America is waiting for the next one,'' said Warren
Littlefield, a producer who was president of NBC Entertainment when
it put shows like ``Seinfeld'' and ``Friends'' on its schedule.
``The rule in television is follow the trends, then buck them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the producers of ``Home Improvement'' have decided
to all but pull out of the medium that made them wealthy, a rarity
in the business. Indeed, the show's finale was conspicuously
elegiac for the team that created and oversaw ``Home Improvement,''
Williams, Carmen Finestra and David McFadzean, who make up the Wind
Dancer Production Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Improvement'' was one of the great successes of the early
1990s and it may earn $1 billion by the time its years of reruns
run out, say television executives. The Wind Dancer partners are
estimated to have earned tens of millions of dollars each on the
program.
</P>
<P>
   But the trio has failed to produce another hit show, striking
out with attempts like ``Soul Man,'' ``Buddies'' and ``Costello.''
And now, with the proliferation of cable channels and the eager
effort by advertisers to attract young slices of the audience,
there seems to be less demand for the sort of program Wind Dancer
excels at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that, because of the competition from cable, the
networks are not looking for a show that appeals to all age levels,
the traditional family shows,'' said Finestra. ``I feel like I can
do more of what I want to be doing in a movie. We're sort of
old-fashioned in the kinds of shows we like to do and this world
has changed so much in just a few years.''

 LOS ANGELES: few years.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC Entertainment chairman Stu Bloomberg said traditional family
sitcoms may still get on the air, but less frequently, and
certainly not without an unusual point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is harder to put a domestic comedy on,'' Bloomberg
said. ``There were more domestic comedies in the days of single
television households and before cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is still trying to develop a small number of series
ideas, Wind Dancer is now focusing on a big slate of movies and
plays. In fact, the company has commissioned plays from more than a
dozen writers _ including Rick Dresser, Daisy Foote, Heather
McDonald and Eduardo Machado _ and it is producing ``The Bubbly
Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,'' at Playwrights Horizon in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going aggressively back into half-hour television,''
said McFadzean. ``Now we're producing movies, and I'm really
interested in the plays we're involved with.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree Wind Dancer's problems are typical, since few
successful creators of sitcoms have second acts as vibrant as the
first. (As it happens, Castle Rock, the company that produced
``Seinfeld,'' has also failed to create a follow-up success.) And
even the elements that made ``Home Improvement'' a hit were
somewhat unique and therefore tough to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, the show had Tim Allen, a popular stand-up
comedian whose visibility was growing when ``Home Improvement''
went on the air in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Allen's character, Tim Taylor, related to a
powerful thread running through popular culture at that time.
Taylor was the host of a small cable show called ``Tool Time,''
about, of course, home improvement. He was depicted as a somewhat
coarse man's man who loved power tools and grunting and had a hard
time understanding the woman in his life, his wife. His personality
tied in perfectly with the Iron John movement for men, which was
popular when the show went on the air. (It didn't hurt either that,
for the first few seasons, Pamela Anderson, wearing a tight
T-shirt, played the ``Tool Time Girl'' on the fictional home
improvement show.)
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed, taking a toll. ``Home Improvement'' was
the No. 1 rated show in the 1993-1994 season. But in the most
recent week for which there are figures, April 26 to May 2, ``Home
Improvement'' ranked 33rd, with 11.02 million viewers, according to
Nielsen Media Research. The No. 1 rated sitcom, ``Frasier,'' had
21.4 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, Wind Dancer had a staff of about 30 people
in its offices on the Walt Disney studio lot in Burbank, most of
them involved in developing more than a dozen television show ideas
on which the company was banking.
</P>
<P>
   The company got four new shows on the air after ``Home
Improvement.'' That is a good track record. But none of the shows
lasted.
</P>
<P>
   So more recently, Wind Dancer slashed its staff in half, to
about 15 people, and reduced the number of television projects it
was working on to three or so, two of them dramas rather than
sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it has commissioned plays from more than a dozen
writers and it has more than a dozen movie projects in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, but mostly liberating,'' said Finestra, who is the
co-author of a movie script titled ``Harv the Barbarian.'' ``It's
just such a different world than the one we grew up in.''

NORTEL UNIT DEVELOPS HIGH-CAPACITY FIBEROPTIC TECHNOLOGY

<P>
   A subsidiary of Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd. says it has
developed a technology that will massively increase the capacity of
the world's telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel Networks Carrier Packet Solutions in Billerica, Mass.
plans to bring the product to market next year.
</P>
<P>
   The new data compression method will allow a single strand of
optical fiber to carry 160 high-speed data streams at the same
time. That would mean that a single strand, about the thickness of
a human hair, could transmit the contents of the Library of
Congress in just a few seconds, or support 28 million Internet
users at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Valovic, research manager for optical networking at
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass., said the Nortel
system would prevent what communications engineers call ``fiber
exhaust,'' a situation in which the optical fiber in a network is
crammed to capacity with data. ``The name of the game is capacity,
pure and simple,'' Valovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber optic cables transmit data as pulses of laser light.
Booming Internet use is rapidly consuming the capacity of existing
fibers. So Nortel and other fiber optic technology companies have
been scurrying to find ways to squeeze more signal onto existing
fiber cables, rather than force telephone and Internet companies to
lay new cables.
</P>
<P>
   The favored approach, and the one used by Nortel, is called
``dense wavelength division multiplexing.'' This is a way of
squeezing many different streams of laser light, each with a
slightly different ``color'' or wavelength, onto one strand of
fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Valovic said that a massive increase in data network capacity
won't translate quickly into lower telecommunications costs,
because it'll cost many millions of dollars to install the new
technology. ``It'll take a long time for the benefits to get to the
end user,'' he said, ``but we've got to make these systems cheaper,
easier to deploy, and then we'll see the costs come down.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Serbs and a few Albanians are trickling
back to Pristina, Kosovo's capital. The sunny daytime streets, with
a few pedestrians and shoppers, now display a poor imitation of
ordinary life, so long as one doesn't focus too hard on the empty,
looted Albanian districts, the bomb damage and the nearly total
lack of children in the town.
</P>
<P>
   A few cafes have reopened, from about 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., and
there is coffee, for a price, when there is the electricity to make
it. Mostly there's running water, too, and the central city has had
little bombing for a month now.
</P>
<P>
   There are lines for bread and for what little meat or milk is
sometimes available, and almost no cooking oil or sugar. And there
seems to be no gasoline for private sale.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO escalates its air campaign, the sound of NATO warplanes
and the thud of their munitions echoes day and night, even if
intermittently, and in the evenings and long dark hours, there is
sometimes the sound of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   So there is no shortage of fear and wariness. Some Albanian
families have remained in their apartments, refusing to go outside
for nearly six weeks now, while the elderly or some sympathetic
Serb neighbors do their shopping, or have made them Serb nameplates
for their apartment doors.
</P>
<P>
   Other Albanians, mostly the elderly, move freely through the
town, but seem to flinch when a Yugoslav soldier or policeman
appears, or even when a stranger approaches.
</P>
<P>
   And some Albanians are continuing to leave. At a downtown bus
stop, a small knot of Albanians waited, carefully watching as
strangers approached to talk. They seemed to shrink back, but told
quietly that this was an American journalist, a middle-aged woman
in a purple sweater said she was finally fleeing Pristina, to try
to get to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what pushed her now to leave, her eyes darted about, to
see who might be listening. ``You know everything already,
everything,'' she whispered. ``What shall I tell you? It's been
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Her whole family had left, she said, and now she would try to
find them in Macedonia. ``But I have no idea where they are,'' she
said. A few others tried to hush her.
</P>
<P>
   Would she and other Albanians come back to Kosovo? ``Yes, if
things change,'' she said. ``But not like this. Now there are too
many people listening,'' she said, turning away.
</P>
<P>
   In a line of Albanians waiting for bread, outside a former
grocery shop with its windows broken but its metal grilles still
intact, a few older men were willing to talk softly.
</P>
<P>
   They'd been waiting a half-hour for bread. There are no
rationing coupons, they said. ``You don't need coupons, just
money,'' said one man bitterly. All their families had already
left. ``Just the old people stay,'' one man said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if life was becoming any more normal, he said urgently,
also gazing around: ``Go to Podujevo and Pec and Prizren and see
what it looks like. Here it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the purging of Kosovar Albanians may be continuing
elsewhere in Kosovo, the worst depredations seem to be over, here,
for now, according to some Serbs and Albanians interviewed here. In
the first two weeks after the bombing started on March 24, radical
Serbs with guns, masked paramilitaries and at least some police
rampaged through the city, burning and looting and ordering
Albanians to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves also ran rampant, sometimes rushing up apartment house
stairs during air raids while the occupants rushed down to the
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if patriotic Serbs will later feel any shame at what was
done in their name in Kosovo, a senior Serb official here said
without hesitation: ``A lot.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But events were worse in Pec and Podujevo than in Pristina, he
said. ``It was a catastrophe,'' he said. ``Podujevo was emptied in
about three hours. There were a lot of vile and angry people,
maddened, who were out of control.'' And in the Albanian villages
where the Kosovo Liberation Army was strongest, he said, he was
sure that terrible things happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there were mass killings and mass graves,'' he
said. ``But I certainly believe that people were shot to death.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighed, then said: ``There are times when something gets
broken in the minds of people, and no one is ever the same as they
were before.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People in Pristina suggest the first wave of refugees was
ordered or threatened into leaving soon after the bombing began,
after the observers from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe withdrew and foreign journalists were pushed
out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The second wave left because of the bombing downtown on the
night of April 6 to 7, with everyone who owned a car taking off and
as many as 5,000 people at a time at the bus and train stations.
</P>
<P>
   The third wave left in a generalized panic, because everyone
else seemed to be leaving.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to put good numbers on the exodus, since
there was no good estimate of how many Albanians lived in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   But those who remainded, one Albanian said Tuesday, ``were the
old, the sick and the people so afraid they did not even want to
open their doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Serbs, left, too, and those who stayed sent their
wives and children north out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of Serbs always lived in Pristina, Kosovo's
capital. The situation is calmer now, residents of varying ethnic
groups say. The authorities, who are trying to advertise the return
of sanity, if not normality, are now saying that 350 Serb
civilians, policemen and soldiers have been arrested for crimes
against civilians, like looting and arson.
</P>
<P>
   And they say that the army and police have mostly cleared off
the paramilitaries, most of whom were radical Serbs who had learned
their trade in Bosnia and applied it here.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbs and the Albanians who remain keep their distance
from each other. At a meat shop, the butcher raised the metal grill
over the door to let in one person at a time. While he served
Albanians, any Serb seemed to be allowed to cut to the head of the
line.
</P>
<P>
   While the outskirts of Pristina have been hit repeatedly and
very hard by NATO, especially army barracks and warehouses,
gasoline and fuel depots and the civilian and military airports,
the damage in the central city is concentrated, but limited.
</P>
<P>
   The central city Government office building is wrecked, as is
the main post office and telephone exchange. That knocked out most
telephones and the cell-phone network, further cutting off
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Some bombs or missiles went astray, destroying houses behind the
telephone exchange, killing at least 10 people, and a row of shops
and restaurants. One huge bomb, apparently intended for a fuel
storage depot, blew a 50-foot crater into the city's central
cemetery, blasting gravestones and sending bones flying.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the remains have been returned with ceremony to
the earth, shards of bone and chunks of smashed coffins still
litter the ground. At the gravesite of the Brankovic family, the
tombstone is propped up from behind by a tree limb and a wooden
cross. Dojcin Brankovic had died in 1991, and the stone erected
then had a place for his widow, Zlatinka, with her name and birth
year, 1917, already etched. She died from the bomb that missed the
telephone exchange, her family gravesite broken by the bomb that
missed the fuel depot.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Walking around the back of the blasted telephone exchange, an
Albanian man agreed to talk. Shefki Islami, 60, said he had
remained in Pristina. ``No one ever came to my house and pushed me
out,'' he said, then stopped and added carefully: ``But if they
come you should leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the city now, he said: ``To be honest, it's a little
bit better. It's calmer now, over the last few days. Before that,
it was very tense.'' Noticing a lingering Serb, he said, ``That's
enough now,'' and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   An unshaven but elegant old man emerged from a lane behind a
burned car and agreed to talk through a Serbian interpreter. Ali
Reja, 77, is a pensioner, long retired from his job as an editor
with the Rilindija state publishing house. His wife, Iqbala, was
sick, he said, and he was off to try to find her some milk, but he
also was happy to show a stranger the aftermath of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to automobile fenders still hanging in the trees, to
the thick ropes of tangled copper wire that hung over a brick wall
like dreadlocks, to a chrome wheel and melted tire that had
embedded themselves on a roof and to an engine that landed on one
blasted car from another 30 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Reja considers himself a ``loyal Albanian,'' who had fought for
Yugoslavia and profited within it. ``I was born three times,'' he
said. ``Once from my mother, the second time in World War II, when
I was a partisan fighter, and my third birthday is April 7, when I
survived this bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a reporter into his garage, where he bemoaned that his
books stored there had caught fire, and then talked a bit more
freely. ``What the Serbs have done here will change things
forever,'' he said. ``But one day the war will stop, and then the
Albanian question will be settled.'' After all, he noted, even the
French and Germans get along these days. ``We are no exception,''
he said. ``We cannot be excused from living together.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many Albanians would return, he shrugged. ``Who could
know? No one in the Balkans knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for details about events here, Reja stopped then, saying
abruptly: ``Are you satisfied? What else can I tell you but I thank
you.'' He walked back out into the sun, onto the lane littered with
burned car parts and copper wiring. ``And if you're not
satisfied,'' he said smiling politely, distant again, ``I also
thank you.''

<P>
   HANOK, South Korea _ A blast of steam caught Park Ki Soon in the
face as she peered into the caldron of beans and began stirring,
feeling ever more sorry for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young I did what my mother-in-law said,'' Mrs.
Park, 70, said morosely as she used a wooden paddle to churn the
beans. ``But now my daughter-in-law doesn't listen to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now I'm making this bean paste, and I'm feeling miserable
because I'm an old woman and she's using me. I don't know why she
doesn't make bean paste herself. I think she just wants to be
comfortable. She never likes hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   The small group of women clustered around Mrs. Park, here in the
village of Hanok about 30 miles northwest of Seoul, nodded their
heads in agreement. Young Koreans, they concluded, are
incomprehensible and insufferable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to the cities, I look at young people, the way they
dress, the way they behave, and they aren't Korean,'' said Choi Sam
Soon, 55, who was also making bean paste. ``Young people always
carry credit cards, and they get money from machines! They always
spend money so recklessly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And young people abandon things that are still usable,'' Mrs.
Choi added, shaking her head at the idea. ``Some people throw out
old kettles, so I pick them up and take them home and use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that young people are not thrilled
about having their mothers or mothers-in-law rifling through other
people's garbage to rescue battered old kettles. And such
skirmishes are only one facet of a generation gap that many South
Koreans say is greater than almost anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Korea was one of the last places to open up to Western
influences; until a century ago it was an ancient kingdom that
operated on Confucian traditions and deeply regimented customs.
Those customs _ especially respect for the elderly _ permeated
Korean society until the last few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, South Korea has been one of the
fastest-changing societies in the world. The economy grew at a
blistering pace, the country industrialized and urbanized, a middle
class emerged, and these days respect tends to go to those with
money and e-mail accounts, not to the old men and women who make
great bean paste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generation gaps exist everywhere, but the gap is wider here,
because Western culture is pouring in at an amazing speed,'' said
Annette E.Y. Ahn, 28, an interpreter in Seoul who grew up partly in
the United States and Europe. ``I also think it's wider here
because looking back in history, we were the last country to open
up to Western culture, and now the doors are open and it's pouring
in.''
</P>
<P>
   These gaps seem to cause misunderstandings and sadness, but
fewer open explosions than one might expect. Young and old alike
may stew inside at the foolishness of the other, but they also
describe how they go out of their way to accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant bother to live with the old folks,'' said
Chong Kum Sook, 38, who lives in the same house as her husband's
parents. ``It's very hard. It's not that they complain, but I feel
the burden on myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My in-laws are early risers, so I try to get up when they do.
And in the summer I can't wear skimpy clothes, because I have to
dress cautiously so as not to disturb them. I should be careful not
to make them unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Korean women were traditionally expected to dress very primly,
and indeed a young woman was arrested for indecency just four years
ago when she wore a T-shirt that exposed her navel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see girls exposing themselves in short dresses, I'm
shocked,'' said Koh Kap In, a 79-year-old matriarch who was sitting
outside her house. ``But I've never said a word to my
granddaughters. It's the times. All the young women are in those
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Most elderly Koreans say that they are often shocked at the
laziness, immorality or extravagance of young people, but that
mostly they bite their tongues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I complain, would they listen?'' asked Kim Hae Song, 78, a
stooped woman who was outside weeding her garden. ``No. That would
only put them on bad terms with me. In my heart I feel upset at
what goes on, but I don't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kim and her husband, Kwon Sang Mook, 81, are most offended
at the disappearance of traditional etiquette, which young people
often breach without even realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see young people smoking in front of their elders,'' Kwon
said, shaking his head. ``Young people say they are so smart, but
what is the point of knowledge if you don't know how to behave?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   The elderly often seem particularly poignant because, mixed in
with the outrage at the way their grandchildren or daughters-in-law
behave, there is also often pride at their education and
worldliness.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her kitchen, Lee Hee Ja, 58, a housewife, served
coffee and a 40-minute denunciation of young people. She fretted
that her eldest daughter-in-law will not carry on the family
rituals, that her second daughter-in-law has not minded her advice
to dress modestly, that neither can cook properly and that none of
the young people are attentive enough to her own needs. But then
Mrs. Lee paused, smiled and sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm wrong,'' she said. ``Young people now are very
bright. So smart! So I don't know. Maybe in the end my
daughters-in-law will be better than I was.''

GERMANS TO WELCOME CLINTON AS SUPPORT FOR WAR WAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ President Clinton is to arrive in Germany on Wednesday
for a two-day visit intended to demonstrate allied unity and to
bolster the German government, which is under increasing pressure
over NATO's air campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   German officials said no diplomatic breakthrough was expected
during Clinton's stay and made clear that the bombing was expected
to continue at least into next week, despite the president's
allusion on Monday to the possibility of a pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, up to now, Slobodan Milosevic has scarcely moved,''
said one senior German official, referring to the Yugoslav
president. ``I do not see any imminent possibility of a halt to the
bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer NATO's campaign goes on, the more frayed the
``red-green'' coalition of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder may become.
Already, Schroeder is facing some vociferous calls for an end to
the war from within his own Social Democratic Party and from the
once pacifist Greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing of Serbia cannot be justified from any possible
standpoint,'' Oskar Lafontaine, a prominent Social Democrat and
former finance minister in Schroeder's government, said last
weekend. ``It is wrong to label whole groups of people good or
evil. It is senseless to bomb bridges and then turn around and plan
how to rebuild them.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was Lafontaine's first since he quit the
government in March. It reflected growing uneasiness on the left of
the Social Democratic Party, although up to now such antiwar
feeling has been fairly muted.
</P>
<P>
   The growing criticism has involved allegations that the bombing
violates international law, outrage over civilian deaths and
uneasiness at the high cost of the war. Schroeder told his party on
Monday that the United States is paying 90 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens, minority partners in the government, are to hold a
party congress next week that is certain to reflect its sharp
divisions over the war. If a motion for an immediate stop to the
bombing is passed, the coalition could be endangered. But Joschka
Fischer, the Green foreign minister, will strive to avert such a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not Great Britain,'' said one official close to
Schroeder. ``This war is not an easy sell to a people whose
pacifist feelings are still strong. That is one reason why the
picture of Clinton and Schroeder standing together is so
important.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be particularly important because German uneasiness is
such that any suggestion of the use of ground troops could lead to
the fall of the government. And without ground forces, or even the
threat of their use, NATO's air campaign could be extremely long.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has found itself at the center of Balkan diplomacy over
the past week, striving to use its strong ties with Russia to coax
Russia toward support of the allied demands in Kosovo. These
demands include the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops, the return of
all refugees, and their protection by an international military
force.
</P>
<P>
   German officials said Russia appeared to have moved some way
toward realizing that it had greater interest in supporting the
West than in supporting Milosevic. Germany said Tuesday that it
would be host to a meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of
Seven major industrialized nations, plus Russia, in Bonn on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also be in Bonn that day. The meeting will be aimed
above all at demonstrating Russian backing for most of NATO's aims,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working above all to secure a single front,'' said
Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Schroeder, ``and
to make sure that Milosevic's World War III tactics make no
headway.''
</P>
<P>
   German officials with normally reliable intelligence say they
have detected some indications of cracks in Milosevic's support.
``Those who back Milosevic because they depend on him see that he
cannot protect them any longer,'' said one official. ``Internal
opposition is growing, and that could become clear next week.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say what might happen next week, or where the
focus of resistance might emerge.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether allied countries were working on a covert
plan for Milosevic's overthrow _ something they publicly deny _ and
whether the official was indulging in propaganda or wishful
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The core of Milosevic's backing has traditionally come from a
small group of ministers and political allies who have been granted
lucrative control of various import-export businesses, from the
well-paid architects of the government's propaganda, and from a
cosseted core of military police. The army has been more
ambivalent, at least until the NATO campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting Schroeder on Thursday, Clinton is to visit
American military bases in Germany that have played a role in the
Kosovo campaign, meet Kosovar Albanian refugees who have come to
Germany, and talk to the three American soldiers released from
Yugoslav captivity on Sunday. They are at an American military
hospital near Ramstein.

SENATORS THREATEN ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY OVER VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top senators on Tuesday warned the makers of
violent films and video games to stop targeting children in their
advertising or the government would do it for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us wants to resort to regulation, but if the
entertainment industry does not do something to change their
methods, we will be forced to act,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the mass killing at a high school in
Littleton, Colo., several key senators accused the entertainment
industry of luring young viewers with violence and threatened to
investigate the industry's marketing strategies if it did not start
to police the targeting of advertising toward minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard to guess who they're trying to sell to when
violent films are advertised on MTV, and directors pick teen idols
to star in their films and video games are sold at `Toys R' Us'
stores,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
said he would propose having the Federal Trade Commission probe
whether entertainment companies are marketing violent films, music
and videos to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans were justifiably outraged when it was
discovered that tobacco companies marketed cigarettes to
children,'' Hatch said. ``I believe that we should be equally
concerned if we find that violent music and video games are being
marketed to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the state and federal governments, tobacco
companies have pulled mascots and advertising that appealed to
minors.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch added that he was considering an ``enforcement mechanism''
for the current ratings systems to ensure that children cannot
watch movies or buy video games without parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the entertainment industry voluntarily rates each
movie and video game according to the amount of violence, sex and
offensive language in the product. The ratings are used by theaters
and video rental stores to theoretically prevent minors from
watching or buying inappropriate material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite a comprehensive rating system, there is little
evidence that such ratings are enforced or even taken seriously,''
said Hatch, who did not explain how the mechanism would work.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the National Institute on Media and the Family found
that a majority of children spend more time watching television,
listening to music and playing video games than they do with their
parents. The study also said that most children will see nearly
1,000 killings on television and in the movies by the age of 10.
</P>
<P>
   While calling on increased self-regulation of the entertainment
industry and greater enforcement of ratings systems, the senators
pointed out that they were not in favor of government censorship of
films, music or videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to tell artists what they can and can't
produce, only that they should not try to sell violent products to
our children,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was part of Washington's effort to delve into last
month's shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton. Two
teen-aged boys killed a teacher and 12 fellow students before
turning their guns on themselves. At least 21 other people were
wounded in the assault.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Clinton will hold a conference on violence
that will include leaders from government, the clergy, and the
entertainment and Internet industries.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's hearing, only one entertainment industry
representative testified before the senators. Jack Valenti,
president of the Motion Picture Association of America, defended
the film industry, saying most directors and producers use little
violence in their movies.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned how large an influence films had on
teen-agers, arguing that a person's moral character is developed
very early in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with my old priest who said, `Give me a child until he
is 7 years old and the world can have him after that,''' Valenti
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the three ``pillars'' of children's lives _ home, school
and church _ must form an ``impenetrable shield'' around them to
protect them from immorality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that moral core, no legislation or executive order
will protect our children,'' Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Congress and the president to require elementary school
students to take an ethics class each year to learn the difference
between right and wrong.

UNKNOWN DISEASE KILLING GOLD MINERS IN CONGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By IAN FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia _ More than 60 people in northeastern Congo have
died of an unknown disease that has killed most its victims, nearly
all of them gold miners, within six days.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the disease, which has killed 63 people, appeared
to be some kind of hemorrhagic fever, the most deadly of which is
caused by the Ebola virus. In 1995, 244 people died in an outbreak
of Ebola in the city of Kikwit, in western Congo.
</P>
<P>
   A medical team Tuesday shipped out the first samples of infected
blood to a laboratory South Africa in an effort to identify the
disease. Dr. Marc Biot, a researcher with Doctors Without Borders,
the medical group that sent the team into the mining town of Durba,
said the symptoms of this disease appear to differ slightly from
Ebola. He said that even though a doctor who had treated the
patients died, many more medical workers had died in the Ebola
outbreak, as did more family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems not to be as contagious as the Kikwit version,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Biot stressed that it was too early to draw firm conclusions
about the virus until the blood samples were tested. He said the
tests could be completed by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no treatment for Ebola or many other hemorrhagic
fevers, so the concern about the deaths runs deep among doctors
around the world. Dr. Ray R. Arthur, a medical officer at the World
Health Organization in Geneva, said that in the last two years
there had been 50 confirmed cases of Ebola worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur said that while details were sketchy, doctors in the
field said the first cases might have appeared in November. Biot
said 58 of the people who had died were miners who worked illegally
in a closed gold mine near Durba, living together in what he called
``terrible,'' unsanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Two women and two children who lived with the miners also died,
Biot said. A regional medical officer who had treated patients also
died on April 23 in the town of Isoro, to the west. Most of the
victims died in clinics in Durba or in the nearby town of Watsa.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms start with a headache, as well as joint and muscle
pain. On the second day, diarrhea and vomiting begin and soon blood
appears in both. Death usually occurs on the sixth day, Biot said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that patients also develop respiratory infections, which
is not the case with Ebola. Also they do not develop red, bloody
eyes, as happens with Ebola, he said. . Ray said it did not appear
that the disease was spreading rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragic as the number of deaths that have occurred are, we are
not looking at an explosive outbreak at this time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congo is in the midst of a civil war, and the area is controlled
by rebels seeking to overthrow President Laurent Kabila. But in an
unusual display of cooperation, government health officials have
been given permission to travel to the region to help stem any
spread of the disease.

A FURNITURE MAKER WHO PAID HOMAGE TO THE TREE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Wash.)  (af) 
 Elizabeth hayt is an art historian and critic  
 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 40 years ago, when Roland and Victoria Fiore went to a
local fair at St. Martin's Church in New Hope, Pa., they won a
small cherry wood stool by the designer George Nakashima, who lived
in the area. The couple became friendly with him and, by the
mid-1970s, Ms. Fiore, 77, a former opera singer, was spending
Saturdays at his studio.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 15 years, she helped out there as a receptionist,
receiving $100 every month, earnings that she diligently applied to
buying her employer's furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Like most collectors of Nakashima's furniture, Ms. Fiore did not
just buy a handful of pieces to use as design accents; she filled
her home with the designer's work. Installing Nakashima tables,
chairs, cabinets, bedroom sets and more, she created a total
environment out of his elegant wood furniture, notable for angular
bases topped with primitive slabs of wood displaying grain patterns
and naturally craggy edges.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the entire collection _ save for that very first
stool _ was sold for more than $170,000, roughly three times the
presale estimate, at David Rago Modern Auctions in Lambertville,
N.J., one of the primary auctioneers of Nakashima furniture.
</P>
<P>
   A walnut music stand made for Ms. Fiore's husband, a conductor,
went for $27,500. A pair of walnut stools with the original
cushions of vintage Japanese silk sold for $21,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, prices for Nakashima's work have more
than doubled. In June 1996, a king-size platform bed with a walnut
headboard sold at David Rago for $6,300; in November 1998, a
queen-size version with a maple burl headboard went for $22,000. In
March 1998, Sotheby's auctioned a walnut dining table and six
chairs, circa 1970. Estimated at $10,000 to $15,000, the lot went
for $43,200, the record price for the designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that he was recently discovered but that people are
appreciating him more,'' said Greg Kuharic, vice president of
20th-century decorative arts at Sotheby's, explaining the demand
for work by Nakashima, who died in 1990 at 85. ``New buyers have
entered the market. The furniture doesn't look dated; the
craftsmanship is quite good. The most popular pieces are the great
slabs of wood that are irregular, with free-form edges and bold
grain patterns, and have butterflies holding together the natural
splits in the wood.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the so-called defects in the wood _ the splits, burls and
knots _ that inspired Nakashima to develop his signature butterfly
joints. ``My father had a reputation for buying weird pieces of
wood,'' said Mira Nakashima-Yarnall, 57. ``A burl could be
conceived as an aberration but for him; that was the art, something
to be recognized and used. The form that nature gives was his
inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   To Nakashima, imperfections in the wood gave his pieces
individuality. Working with domestic woods like black walnut and
cherry and, later, more exotic varieties like English oak burl
rosewood, he oiled and polished the surfaces rather than lacquering
them.
</P>
<P>
   As a Japanese-American, Nakashima attributed his relationship to
trees to his Eastern heritage. He described woodworking as a
spiritual communion with nature. Born in Spokane, Wash., he grew up
surrounded by the great forests of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, after studying architecture at the University of
Washington and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he
traveled to Paris, encountering avant-garde art. To trace his own
roots, he then moved to Tokyo to work for Antonin Raymond, an
American architect; later he went to India to construct an ashram
for Sri Aurobindo, a spiritual leader whose teachings were deeply
influential.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the United States, he married Marion Okajima, and
the couple settled in Seattle in 1941, where Nakashima opened a
furniture business, although he had no formal training as a
craftsman. A year later, after Pearl Harbor, the couple and their
baby daughter, Mira, (a son was later born) were interned in a
relocation camp in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   There, Nakashima met a Japanese carpenter and learned ancient
Asian woodworking techniques. Released from the camp in 1944,
Nakashima and his family moved to New Hope, where he built a
workshop and eventually a museum. The compound is still run by his
daughter, who reissues his designs while producing her own.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did create designs for the furniture makers Knoll
Inc. and John Widdicomb, Nakashima distinguished himself from his
contemporaries with his hand-turned objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work is interesting because it is finely handcrafted at
the same time that everyone else is making industrialized, plastic
furniture in the 50s and 60s,'' said Christopher Mount, assistant
curator in the department of architecture and design at the Museum
of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   The myth surrounding Nakashima's work is that it was a highly
personalized, one-man operation. In fact, Nakashima employed nearly
a dozen workers to execute his designs. ``Customers would go to the
studio and pick a piece of wood, and the image was that George
would make the piece from beginning to end and deliver it to you,''
said Robert Aibel, owner of the Moderne Gallery in Philadelphia.
``After he died, the business nearly died with him because
customers thought he was working independently.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Moderne Gallery held a Nakashima exhibition,
reviving interest in his work and bringing attention to the fact
that the studio was still in operation under Ms. Nakashima-Yarnell.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Nakashima-Yrnall has created her own line of
furniture, Keisho, which means continuation in Japanese. And a new
generation of architects, like Micheal Gabbelini and David Ling,
has commissioned her to make furniture for clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked under Dad for 20 years,'' she said. ``He was like a
great Zen master. As I was growing up, his Eastern philosophy
seemed like hogwash to me. But now, the whole idea that energy
comes from a tree, from the wood, makes sense to me.''

 &HT;    Falcons pondered Anderson trade
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons spoke with the New England
Patriots on NFL draft day about trading All-Pro running back Jamal
Anderson, coach Dan Reeves confirmed Tuesday. ``Things never got
serious, and it never came close to happening,'' said Reeves, who
described the conversation as typical draft-day negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons would have considered trading their top
offensive player if New England had agreed to the Falcons' asking
price of two first-round picks in this year's draft _ the Pats
owned the 20th and 28th overall choices _ and other considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked and surprised and, I guess, stunned by this,''
Anderson said. ``I don't know what's going on or what to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said, ``It's not unusual in any draft to talk about
specific players and what it might take to do something. In fact,
it's rare when it doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they indicated an interest in Jamal last year,'' Reeves
said, ``and their situation is worse now. Every team is looking for
the great back. Look what New Orleans gave up for Ricky Williams. I
think Jamal is a great player, and I hope he finishes his career
here in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   New England has been seeking a top-rate running back since
former Georgia star Robert Edwards, the Patriots' first-round
choice in 1998, suffered a career-threatening knee injury during a
flag-football exhibition. The Falcons initiated talks between the
organizations. The Patriots were concerned about the ability to
sign Anderson to a long-term contract, and because the trade talks
began on draft day, New England had no opportunity to talk with
Anderson's agent, Jim Sims.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also are concerned about re-signing Anderson, 26,
who led the NFC in rushing last season with 1,846 yards, the
ninth-highest total in league history. A five-year veteran,
Anderson is entering the final year of his contract, and
negotiations toward an extension have proceeded slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Without an extension, Anderson would be eligible for
unrestricted free agency next spring, although the Falcons could
retain his right by designating him a ``franchise'' or
``transition'' player.
</P>
<P>
   During negotiations, the Falcons have made an issue about
Anderson's preference for training on his own instead of
participating in the formal offseason conditioning program at
Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   Sims, who was scheduled to speak with general manager Harold
Richardson on Tuesday, said his goal is to reach agreement on an
extension that will make Anderson one of the three highest-paid
running backs in the NFL. He also said Anderson is concerned about
the number of Falcons starters whose contracts lapse after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't moved to keep key players who have contracts
coming up after 1999,'' he said. ``One of our concerns is lack of
commitment as far as locking up key players.''

BRADLEY VERSUS GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Bill Bradley jumped to within 20 points of
Vice President Al Gore in a Democratic trial heat three weeks ago,
the former New Jersey senator suddenly became a hot media property
and Gore the object of pitying remarks about declining political
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   We journalists like a competitive horse race, and some pundits
were happy, on the slightest pretext, to gin up a little momentum
for Bradley and plant the fear of losing in Gore. If there's no
contest, there's no story.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley is fading as rapidly as he rose.
</P>
<P>
   His main appeal is that he's the unGore. If you want a party
alternative to the vice president, Bradley is the only game in
town. But the inescapable questions for Democrats in 2000 are: Why
should they want an alternative? If they do, why Bradley? Who is
Bradley anyway?
</P>
<P>
   It's still Gore's show. He's got the money, the organization,
the name identification and the behind-the-scenes White House
contacts and clout. The powerful political endorsements continue to
roll in.
</P>
<P>
   He's relatively scandal-free, despite a few moneybag monks and
his linkage to President Clinton. In the first three months of this
year, he raised $8.9 million compared with Bradley's $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley becomes a realistic contender only if Gore somehow
throws it away or if the political climate turns dramatically
against the Clinton administration. Gore cannot control the
people's mood, which depends on the result of the air strikes
against Yugoslavia, the state of the domestic economy and the
surprise scandal of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But so far he's doing okay with his own act. His verbal gaffes
remain silly rather than scary. Nobody thinks Gore is a dummy like
Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll, Gore now has
nearly a 3-to-1 lead over Bradley, 66 percent to 23 percent. This
huge gap is unlikely to last forever, but it does indicate that the
Bradley boomlet is a fragile flower indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is supposed to be in political trouble because of wobbly
poll numbers, an unexciting personality and a tendency toward
hyperbole that makes him vulnerable to ridicule. He trails Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in the new USA Today/CNN poll by a larger
margin, 40 percent to 56 percent, than he did in January when Bush
beat him by only one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Washington Post poll, 56 percent of those surveyed
described Gore as a bore. His image as a wooden post is firmly
planted in the public mind.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's colorless nature is actually among the least of his
worries in a primary match with Bradley. Gore is not tussling with
a rabble-rousing bomb-thrower here.
</P>
<P>
   Have you heard Bradley speak lately? Throughout his 18-year
Senate career Bradley was a prominent contender in the boredom
sweepstakes. Observers report that in recent appearances his
oratorical style still doesn't set audiences aflame. If it remains
a contest between a boring vice president and a boring Senate
has-been, count on the guy with the title to win.
</P>
<P>
   At this point the Bradley campaign is an educational exercise,
not a viable come-from-behind political phenomenon. In 1996 Bradley
declined to seek re-election, complaining that the political system
was ``broken.'' Others noted that he had nearly been beaten six
years before and was having trouble raising campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 55, his public service and his fame as a New York Knicks
basketball star are well behind him. Hardly anyone understands his
thinking on public policy or why he has belatedly decided he wants
to be president.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Bradley was considered possible presidential material
_ an ethical, cerebral mainstream Democrat who had stayed out of
trouble and could rally the party faithful. But twice he passed up
opportunities to run and gained a reputation as the Democratic Jack
Kemp, never quite bold enough to take the risk.
</P>
<P>
   His change of heart is a mystery. His political views, insomuch
as we know them, are not so different from Gore's as to drive him
to run as a matter of ideological principle. For example, he has
not taken the lead in the Kosovo debate _ on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's not a bad guy, and he wouldn't sell out his party or
his country or his wife. But neither would Gore, and Gore's got a
lot more going for him.

FORMER POWs JUST CAN'T `BELIEVE' ALL OF THE SUPPORT IN U.S. 
 
By LISA TEACHEY 
and DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDSTUHL, Germany _ Families of the American POWs released by
Yugoslavia spent their first hours with the soldiers offering
plenty of hugs and stories about their loved ones and the rally of
support across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't believe it,'' said Deanna Stone, sister of
Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone. ``They don't believe that everything
would be centering around them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the three servicemen released Saturday received news from
home, doctors who have finished examining the former captives
offered a few more grim details of their month in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the broken bones and minor injuries reported
Monday, doctors reported that the three men suffered from
disorientation because they were forced to wear hoods, and had
abrasions on their wrists from handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez also was shackled, while Spc. Steven
Gonzales and Stone each had a chipped tooth.
</P>
<P>
   The men were seized March 31 after a skirmish with Serbian
forces on the Macedonia-Yugoslav border. Details of how the men
were injured were not released because of the ongoing investigation
into their capture.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen relatives of the three soldiers were flown to Germany
on Monday and spent several hours with them while the men received
medical and psychological examinations and military debriefings.
The soldiers arrived at the medical facility Sunday and are
undergoing a 72-hour repatriation process.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. David Vetter, a Landstuhl doctor, said the Serbs gave
Gonzales fluids intravenously during the first days of captivity.
While too much time has passed to trace if any drugs were
administered, Gonzales told Vetter he was ``shaky'' before he
received the fluids. Vetter said the Serbs may have been treating
him for shock.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, officials said only two soldiers lost weight, but
Tuesday the doctors said all had lost between 8 and 14 pounds. But
the three had been making up for the loss, eating heavily since
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Vetter said Gonzales was taking ``a bite out of everything that
passes in front of him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas, reportedly was most
concerned about his bills and worried creditors might try to
contact his parents. Gonzales asked the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who
negotiated their release, to tell the creditors he promised to pay
them when he got home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the evaluations and debriefings, part of the
soldiers' reintegration process includes spending time with their
families.
</P>
<P>
   The families of Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., and of
Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles talked with reporters Tuesday at an
Army hospital at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, where the
U.S. servicemen were treated.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales' family declined to talk to the media. Parents Gilbert
and Rosie Gonzales and aunt Rosalinda Barrow apparently were
overwhelmed by all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's mother, Vivian Ramirez, said she could not stop
hugging her son at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to let him go so he could breathe,'' she said. ``It was
good to see him. He looks really good. His spirits are up. He's
just wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The families bore gifts to ease the men's return: Stone received
a jersey bearing the logo of his favorite National Hockey League
team, the Detroit Red Wings, and a new coat. Ramirez's gift was a
little more perishable: He got a hamburger from his favorite
California fast-food restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably all hard, but we got it there,'' Vivian
Ramirez said. ``He said, `We'll put it in the microwave.'''
</P>
<P>
   The families said they did not dwell on the soldiers' captivity
and injuries, but instead talked about family and friends and all
the media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't discuss anything that really happened,''
Deanna Stone said. ``We were just glad to see them. That was it.
You can't even explain the feelings that you have, that you don't
even want to talk. You just want to see them and you want to give
them a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are dealing with what happened,'' Stone's sister Dawn
Reliford said. ``It was a very traumatic experience for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it by looking at him that it was painful. That was not
the issue. The issue was that we love him and that we were glad to
see him. We just want to be with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stone nor Ramirez, who had been part of the U.N. Bosnian
peacekeeping force, had seen their families since December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows about the excitement that's been going on,'' Vivian
Ramirez said. ``He can't believe it. He's really surprised. Wait
until he gets home. He will not believe all that's going on until
he sees it for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton left Tuesday for Europe and will try to meet
with the former prisoners of war when he arrives in Germany on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The families agreed the hardest part of the ordeal was behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first time that his picture was shown (of Ramirez in
captivity), there's really nothing you could really think,'' said
Steven Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's mother also said that television broadcast of her son
haunts her still.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that will just stay in my mind,'' Vivian Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Ramirez said she hopes she can stay with her son until he
receives the 30 days leave granted the former prisoners of war by
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stay here until they kick us out,'' she said.

CUBAN COACH DEFECTS AS TEAM VISITS BALTIMORE, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBO-CUBA-ORIOLES, moving in `s' sports category) 
(rm) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The game ended around midnight on Monday, and for
the next few hours, the Cuban baseball team and their band of noisy
supporters continued celebrating a 12-6 victory over the Orioles in
the downtown Baltimore hotel where the team and its 300-member
delegation were staying.
</P>
<P>
   But by early Tuesday, when the group made a hasty departure from
the Baltimore-Washington International Airport for Havana, at least
seven members of the traveling party were missing. American
government officials said one coach defected. Cuban government
officials said the other six Cubans just overslept.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials denied that any members of their team or the
traveling party had sought political asylum in the United States,
which would be a political embarrassment for the Cuban president,
Fidel Castro, who greeted the team Tuesday upon its arrival at Jose
Marti Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But the Baltimore police said that a member of the Cuban
delegation walked into the city's central district police station
at 10 a.m. Tuesday, identified himself as Rigoberto Herrera and
requested asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., who was one of several politicians
who spoke outside the stadium at a boisterous anti-Castro rally
before the game, said the man was Rigoberto Herrera Betancourt, 54,
one of the team's pitching coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Weinhold Jr., a police department spokesman, said
after Herrera identified himself, officers immediately contacted
officials with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who
``took custody'' of him about 90 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Weinhold nor Menendez said they knew how Herrera escaped
the watch of Cuban security forces and found the police station,
which is about a 10-minute walk from the hotel where the Cuban team
was staying. Menendez, an outspoken critic of the Cuban president,
said it was his understanding that about half of the members of the
Cuban delegation were involved with security.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ferro, the INS regional director in Baltimore, said he would
neither confirm nor deny that a Cuban traveling to Baltimore for
the baseball game had sought to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But two U.S. government officials confirmed that the agency was
processing one asylum seeker, and one of them described the man as
one of the Cuban team's coaches.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other six who missed the Havana-bound plane, a
Canadian charter jet that left before 6 a.m., officials at the
Cuban Interests Section here said that the men, all former Cuban
baseball players, did not awake in time to accompany the group to
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Garcia Hernandez, the second secretary of the interests
section, which is housed in the Swiss embassy, described the six as
``former prestigious baseball players'' who ``unfortunately
overslept and missed their airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much celebrating, Garcia was asked? He nodded his head
affirmatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens all the time, in all the countries we play,'' said
another Cuban official, who declined to give his name. ``I don't
know the reasons. I just know the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither official would provide the names of the late-sleepers,
but they said arrangements were being made to fly them home.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Defections are a constant source of concern for Cuban officials
when their star athletes venture outside the country for
competitions. Over the years, a steady stream of them have walked
away from their teams, many to seek the considerable rewards of
professional status in the United States even if their defection
actually occurs in a third country.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Cuban baseball players have been more likely to
defect outside the United States. If they defected here, they would
be required to go through the major league baseball draft, a
restrictive system that ties them to one team. Entering the United
States from a third country enables them to sign with any team as a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   While Cuban athletes enjoy widespread celebrity in their home
country and earn more than average citizens, their salaries and
living conditions are well below even average American standards.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cubas, a Miami-based player agent who has helped other Cuban
athletes defect, including Livan Hernandez of the Florida Marlins,
the World Series most valuable player in 1997, said he met with
several of the Cuban players while they were in Baltimore and
discussed the possibility of defecting.
</P>
<P>
   But time grew short after the game, he said, when Cuban
officials began notifying members of the traveling party sometime
after 3 a.m. that their departure time had been moved up. According
to the delegation's original schedule, the Cubans were to fly out
of Baltimore in mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Cubas and Menendez said that the early departure was spurred by
the disappearance of Herrera and the fear that others in the
traveling party might follow him, seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to get out as quickly as possible,'' Cubas said.
``Everyone was told to get their suitcases and they would be
leaving at 4:40. Players were willing to defect. Unfortunately
because of the rush, they had to cut it short, but this won't be
their last trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Menendez said he was not convinced that the others who missed
the plane had simply overslept. He said Cuba's security forces
would not have overlooked them, and the six had intended to defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing mixed stories,'' Menendez said. ``They might have
overslept. But those of us who know Cuban State Security know they
would not have been unable to wake them to get them out.''

GANDHI AND VAJPAYEE MATCHED UP AS INDIA SCHEDULES NATIONAL
ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ In the contest to see who will be India's
next prime minister, Sonia Gandhi, the widowed inheritor of India's
founding political dynasty, will be matched against the veteran
Hindu nationalist leader Atal Behari Vajpayee. Tuesday the general
elections were scheduled for September and the first week of
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Election Commission rejected the request of the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party for elections next month, citing
what it called ``an unprecedented heat wave'' that has already
pushed temperatures in northern India as high as 118 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The party, which is led by Vajpayee, hoped quick elections would
let it capitalize on a wave of sympathy from voters. Some are upset
that Mrs. Gandhi and her Congress Party helped topple the
Hindu-nationalist-led coalition last month by a single vote in
Parliament, then was unable to form a government to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Election Commission said it needs more time to prepare
for what it called ``the largest organized operation in the
world.'' It is currently adding 15 million voters to rolls that
already list more than 600 million people, a task that will not be
complete until July. And the commission has to mobilize 4 million
people to work at 800,000 polling stations, as well as hundreds of
thousands of security guards.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting will take place in phases on dates in September
and October that the commission will announce ``in due time.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Vajpayee's government, now serving as caretakers,
contend they must operate as an effective government for the next
five months to avoid paralysis. That stance has drawn sharp
criticism from Congress Party officials.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, for example, the government transferred several top
civil servants, including the home secretary, B.P. Singh, a step
that it called a routine shuffle but that Congress leaders
condemned as an attempt to consolidate its power in advance of the
election.
</P>
<P>
   The voting will avoid the worst of the heat, which can seriously
depress turnout, but the commission acknowledged that monsoon rains
and flooding in September are likely to be a serious problem some
areas.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that almost all Indian elections have been held between
November and May. But because the government fell on April 17 and
elections must be held within six months, the commission's only
choice was between oppressive, sometimes life-threatening heat and
torrential downpours.

UNSHACKLED TO CAPTURE THEIR COUNTRY AGAIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Lyle Rexer, an art critic, is writing a book on old-process
photography  
 By LYLE REXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, Hungary was the most photo-obsessed
country in the world. Princes and princesses of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire frequented photo exhibitions and proudly
displayed their own prints. From a nation the size of Indiana
emerged many of the leading names of modern photography, including
Andre Kertesz, Brassai, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Robert Capa.
</P>
<P>
   But four decades of Communist rule isolated Hungarian
photography from this artistic heritage, from the outside world and
from many of its subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the turn of a new century, Hungarian photographers are
struggling to rebuild that tradition. Free at last to point the
camera where they please, they are creating an idiosyncratic
amalgam of imagination and international styles dimly glimpsed.
This combination may be the perfect vehicle to express their
ambivalence about the world after communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been forced to make up our history as we go along,''
said Sandor Szilagyi, who has organized a series of exhibitions of
Hungarian photography at the Hungarian Consulate in New York City.
``There are masters but no movements, personalities but no
trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Two current exhibitions of contemporary Hungarian photography
display the diversity of this improvised avant-garde: ``Kind of
Blue: Six Documentary Photographers'' (organized by Szilagyi at the
Consulate) and ``Hungary Today: Five Contemporary Photographers''
(at the Sarah Morthland Gallery in Chelsea). A self-taught quality
pervades this work. Wheels are reinvented and continents
discovered. But if this made-up modernism sometimes looks almost
familiar, it is just as often unpredictable and daring.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that this generation of photographers should have
to reinvent photography, because Hungarian photography once ruled
the world. In the 1920s, Moholy-Nagy defined the Bauhaus
photographic style with compositions that featured bold, abstract
geometries. Kertesz melded a sense of visual form and an
instinctive feel for the meaningful instant.
</P>
<P>
   Brassai, whose Paris years are now the subject of a major
exhibition at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, helped forge the
myth of modern Paris as a place of hedonism and creativity. Capa,
the prototype of the photojournalist, provided the 20th century
some of its most dramatic images of war. His brother, Cornell, went
on to found the International Center for Photography in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In documentary and art photography, these expatriates bequeathed
a many-dimensioned visual idiom we think of not as Hungarian but as
modern.
</P>
<P>
   The current generation of Hungarians never had a chance to claim
that inheritance. The upheavals of right-wing authoritarian rule,
World War II and 40 years of communism narrowed the scope of
photography.
</P>
<P>
   The door to the West slammed shut, and official policy
transformed pictorial realism into soft-focus folk cliches.
Photographers could not view original prints by the great
expatriate Hungarians, who remained largely just names. Other
native experimental work was almost as inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hungary's largest photo collections _ nearly 400,000
images _ was tucked away in a private apartment. Artists worked
alone and met informally, sharing unsanctioned innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Photography deemed ``conceptual'' or ``formalist'' was taken off
gallery walls, pulled from exhibitions and confiscated from private
homes. The knowledge of basic photographic processes eroded.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, today's photographers used whatever inspiration
they could find to reinvent photographic tradition. In their work,
opportunism constantly triumphs over orthodoxy. Jozsef Hajdu,
represented in last year's Consulate group, taught himself about
the history of the medium by working as an archivist of the
photographs collected by the old Imperial Post Office in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   Hadju's roots are grittily documentary, influenced by the
routines of factory life near his home. But he has read other
lessons in the images he studies, and his black-and-white photos of
his own grimy teacup transform a proletarian realism into a lyrical
play of abstract forms and liquid textures.
</P>
<P>
   Gabor Kerekes has taken the most extreme steps to reclaim
photography as a medium of individual expression. Kerekes, now in
his late 50s, had been the premier Hungarian photojournalist of the
70s. His dispassionate, even icy style enabled him to convey in the
image of an empty factory, for example, a guarded pessimism that
was difficult for the Communists to censor and impossible to
conscript into any campaign for a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
   His was a highly influential vocabulary of constraint. In 1982,
he abandoned his career. ``I had grown tired of making images
ordered by someone else,'' he said during a visit to New York last
year. He could have been speaking for his entire generation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He destroyed all but 20 or so of his images, which he donated to
the Hungarian Museum, and turned inward. ``I couldn't see in the
real world what I sought emotionally and spiritually,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Kerekes immersed himself in the study of, among
other subjects, philosophy, natural history and alchemy. Just as
Hungary emerged from communism, he emerged from artistic
hibernation with a repertory of disturbing visions and an intense
interest in old photographic techniques.
</P>
<P>
   His pictures, often salt or albumen prints, are richly toned
nightmares: a truncated elephant's foot, antique and sinister
scientific equipment, a murky, apocalyptic sunset, body parts. His
closest counterpart in the West is probably Joel Peter Witkin.
</P>
<P>
   His work has inspired an old-process movement in Hungary. In
part, the movement tries to make a virtue of necessity,
compensating for a lack of money to invest in exotic digital
technology. For Kerekes, however, repossessing the past and
reinventing the present go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the work of Zsolt Peter Barta, a protege of Kerekes,
suggests that in the country of ``masters but no movements,'' a
movement may be taking shape. Unlike earlier avant-gardes, its
members share no style but rather an attitude. They face the world
after communism with deep ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Barta's series of close-up black-and-white photos of preserved
human cadavers, for example, can be seen, once the shock wears off,
as an attempt to come to terms with the continuing impact of the
political past. Free to depict any subject, he is drawn to those
that suggest a perpetual inhumanity, preserved in the formaldehyde
of memory.
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence is most obvious in the work of the documentary
photographers, who, perhaps even more than art photographers, feel
compelled to make up a new tradition. So Imre Benko has developed a
monumental style to counter the heroic nationalism that was
Hungary's cold war staple.
</P>
<P>
   His new Hungary is a series of incongruities. In one image, an
impromptu barbecue takes place outside an enormous housing project.
In another, a worker in a steel town looks up at the towering
remnants of a dead industry that has just barely failed to squeeze
the life out of him.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many Hungarians, Benko seems suspicious of every
political gesture, refraining from criticism and celebration.
</P>
<P>
   More partisan are Judit M. Horvath and Gyorgy Stalter, who are
doing for Hungary's Gypsy minority what the Farm Services
Administration photographers did for the rural poor in the United
States: asserting their dignity and calling attention to their
economic condition. Renouncing official folk images of Gypsy life,
Ms. Horvath and Stalter have forged a documentary style that
imports the grandeur and drama of the Magnum photojournalists,
typified by Robert Capa.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate search for a method has left its mark on all the
photographers who came of age under communism, but a younger
generation doesn't feel the need to shoulder the burden of starting
from scratch. To artists like Lenke Szilagyi, the past and the
world are available.
</P>
<P>
   Although farthest removed from the legacy of Kertesz and least
concerned about recovering it, she may be closest to it in spirit.
In her black-and-white images of difficult rural lives lived in an
unlovely Hungary, she orients herself toward a living presence,
however minimized or despairing. She seems to say there will always
be a need for the eye that can divine the essential moments of our
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Hungary dedicated the House of Culture for
Photography, in the renovated Budapest mansion and studio of the
former Austro-Hungarian court photographer Mano Mai. It is modeled
on New York's International Center for Photography.
</P>
<P>
   With a new museum and an international outlook, with the
Internet and travel to Paris and New York, some Hungarian artists
are beginning to wonder what will sustain their work when it leaves
the shadows for the global glare, when idiosyncrasy gives way to
international influence and the masters join movements.
</P>
<P>
   After his initial enthusiasm at visiting the Museum of Modern
Art, Barta wondered if he had lost his innocence. ``We need a
context for our work, yes,'' he said, ``but we also need to think
we are inventing something new.''

   MORINA BORDER POINT, Albania _ Chilling stories of killings,
brutality and destruction poured out of refugees who arrived here
non-stop Tuesday on foot, in tractors and in cars from disparate
parts of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The tales of cold-blooded shootings and gunpoint robberies, if
true, invoke a picture of a new level of barbarity in the Serbian
campaign to erase the ethnic Albanian population from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the drivers get out of the tractors and they
executed them. They took my son, and four meters away from his
father and mother they killed him. They killed my son,'' said Hodit
Aslemi, 59.
</P>
<P>
   Shootings also were reported by refugees arriving from other
parts of Kosovo, and refugees who were questioned said Serb police
or military demanded money from them while holding a knife to the
throat or gun at the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers from Zrze, who had harbored and fed hundreds of
displaced Kosovars in recent weeks, said Serb troops evicted the
entire town of about 3,000 people Tuesday and looted and trashed
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Groups came from four different geographic areas, including
about 2,000 people who had been camping in the mountains for the
last several weeks after being forced from their homes, said Ray
Wilkinson, spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were reports of widespread abductions and kidnappings of
men, and eyewitness reports of executions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,400 Kosovar Albanians crossed from Yugoslavia into
Albania in the stream of refugees that began around noon and
stopped at about 9 p.m. local time
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Wilkinson said the ``closure or movement
of the camps in Kukes'' is ``under active discussion'' by
international relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He said no decision had been made by Tuesday night, but stressed
the Albanian government has evidenced ``growing anxiety'' over the
presence of an estimated 100,000 refugees here, many of whom live
outside the camps.
</P>
<P>
   The closure of camps would mean fast, mandatory removal of at
least 35,000 refugees, a move the refugee agency has been trying to
avoid in favor of convincing the Kosovars to shift voluntarily to
areas in the Albanian interior that are safer from growing
cross-border conflict.
</P>
<P>
   They have refused to go. Most say they want to stay close to
their homes and to the border where they might yet find family
members left behind when they had to leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson had no details on how the refugees might be forced to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee Aslemi said the shooting of his 27-year-old son happened
Sunday night, as his convoy of about 200 tractors was trying to
leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Another son had been wounded Sunday and was limping toward
medical care here as the sun dropped behind the mountains. Aslemi
said a third son had run away Sunday to escape the terror that
struck the caravan about 12 miles outside of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know how many men were shot when the Serb
forces demanded they get down from their tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Aslemi said the Serbs also separated his 83-year-old
father-in-law from the family and left him sitting alone, without
food or water in the middle of a field.
</P>
<P>
   It took the convoy from Sunday until Tuesday night to get here
to safety, said Aslemi, who sat with his sister atop the blankets
and other goods his family managed to haul away on their
tractor-drawn cart. His wife and other family members had been
taken to shelter, but the pair was settling in to guard the last of
their possessions all night in the cart that had blown a wheel and
could not be moved to the camps in Kukes 15 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we crossed the border we did not cry,'' he said, as he
and his sister sat atop the remnants of their lives and wept.
``Everything is over in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in weeks, refugees everywhere seemed
overwhelmed by anguish and despair of ever returning to normal life
in their homes. Till now, a buoyant spirit of hope has prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   At a holding tent on the Kukes square where hundreds of refugees
probably would spend the night, 56-year-old Nuhi Kolgeci expressed
feelings that NATO and America had betrayed the Kosovo people by
failing to stop the Serb military and police.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tanks all over my village. Why don't they bomb
them?'' asked Kolgeci, who sat on the ground with his wife and a
retarded daughter, dirty and ragged from the two weeks they had
spent in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   He said a son and a brother both had been wounded Sunday night
when they tried to flee Serb army troops that surrounded their
makeshift mountain camp, where their only shelter had been plastic
sheeting. Both were left in the care of young men on the run from
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Kolgeci did not see the killing of a distant cousin who was said
to have been shot while being herded down the mountain later that
day, but three women said they witnessed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was putting his cap in a bag carried by his wife,'' said
Nexhamije Rraci, 35. ``They said to stop, but he left it in the
bag. Then they separated him from the others and shot him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rraci said she was directly behind the man, Ramadan Kolgeci,
when he was drawn from the column coming down the mountain and shot
in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all so close, I don't know how they didn't shoot
others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Nuhi Kolgeci told the rest of his story _ about the odyssey
of walking through two days and many towns, about his daughter who
was a student in Pristina and now has gone missing _ he became
inconsolable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel better to die myself,'' he said, sobbing. ``What
is the use of my life now?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The fax in Joe Addis' makeshift office near Skopje, Macedonia,
has been whirring since the Catholic Relief Services official set
up shop near a refugee camp in April. Businesses and brokers have
besieged him with sales pitches for tents, toothpaste, food,
vegetable oil, laundry soap, sanitary napkins and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Several auto dealers that have exclusive franchises with Toyota,
Ford or Nissan to sell to relief groups, have offered him
all-terrain vehicles. Generic drug wholesalers in Britain and the
Netherlands that specialize in supplying field clinics with
aspirin, antibiotics and antidepressants, have been in touch with
him. So has a company in South Carolina that sells plastic
sheeting, a New York City company that offers blankets and one in
Massachusetts that sells prefabricated warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   In any disaster _ war, hurricane, famine _ government agencies
and humanitarian organizations rush to bring aid. Standing behind
them is a growing ``disaster industry,'' a loose conglomeration of
companies and middlemen for which bad times can mean boom business.
</P>
<P>
   The companies include small manufacturers whose normal business
does not include disasters but which are eager to seize a sudden
opportunity. But for the bulk of the companies, which are largely
based in Europe and employ from 10 to 500 people, sales to relief
and development agencies are their main business. Some are
specialized procurement brokers that for a commission of 5 to 20
percent will search for items needed by relief groups like surplus
field kitchens, bulletproof vests and concertina wire.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, governments and international organizations spend
tens of billions of dollars on both long-term relief projects and
emergencies. And large buyers like the federal government will buy
directly from manufacturers, negotiating contracts and storing
emergency supplies at warehouses worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But in a crisis like the war in Kosovo, charities, both large
and small, pour hundreds of millions into a region. In these
chaotic situations, they often turn to companies and brokers that
are disaster specialists that can ship goods quickly, track down
hard-to-find items and even extend credit. In addition, some relief
organizations do not have their own procurement offices and rely on
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies employ former relief workers and say they can do
well by doing good. Others see a huge aid effort as an opportunity
to profiteer by selling goods at inflated prices to humanitarian
groups or to donate drugs close to their expiration date rather
than paying to destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of thousands of refugees in the Balkans in need of
blankets, some dealers are holding back the 5 to 10 percent
discount normally given for bulk purchases, one major procurement
agency said. Depending on quality and material, a blanket used in
relief operations costs from $1.50 to $5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we would normally expect a bulk discount, the discount
is not coming through,'' said Tony Urwin, a buyer with Crown Agents
Ltd., a nonprofit procurement service that was part of the British
government until a few years ago. Urwin declined to identify the
dealers but said he was able to find a blanket manufacturer in the
United States willing to give him the discount.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Vliestra, the commercial director of the International
Procurement Agency, a Dutch company, said it was supplying groups
in Kosovo, including World Vision International, with items it had
bought from around the world. Blankets are coming from an Egyptian
producer, plastic sheeting used for ground coverings is coming from
a Dutch company, and inexpensive pots and pans from a Czech
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a madhouse at the moment,'' Vliestra said.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable estimates for the size of the industry that serves the
disaster and long-term relief market do not exist. With rare
exceptions, all the companies selling disaster supplies are private
and do not disclose their sales. But Kim Ginnerup, the director of
Mission Pharma, a Danish drug wholesaler for which relief groups
account for about half of sales, estimated that for drugs alone,
the relief market amounted to $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   He said that much of the modern industry sprang up in Europe
about 25 years ago among companies focused on supplying Africa,
where much relief work was then under way.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have roots in the nonprofit world. Greg
Spitzfaden, an official of Tri-Med of Britain, said that company
got its start when its three founders began arranging the shipment
of relief items bought with the proceeds from charity rock concerts
like Live Aid and Band Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the company branched into procurement and now has offices
close to troubled regions, said Spitzfaden, who recently flew to
Macedonia to visit refugee camps and work with clients, including
Addis of Catholic Relief Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 13 offices in the places in the world that are at the
absolute bottom of everyone's tourist list,'' he said. Spitzfaden's
office is in one of the world's more idyllic spots, Peterborough,
N.H., and many of the European-based concerns have offices here so
they can work closely with relief groups based in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   While brokers like Tri-Med will seek out anything requested by a
relief group, other companies specialize. Toyota Gibraltar, in the
British colony, is Toyota Motor's exclusive dealer to agencies
working in relief and development worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   A competitor, Kjaer &AMP; Kjaer, a Danish company that holds the
Nissan Motor relief distributorship, has based a salesman in
Sarajevo to deal with charities and government agencies operating
in Albania and Macedonia and has posted his cellular telephone
number on its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Kosovo is deteriorating every minute,'' the
company's site states. ``We may be able to assist your efforts in
the region.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Soeren Laursen, Kjaer's marketing manager, said it had sold
about 100 all-terrain and pickup vehicles in recent years to groups
working in the Balkans. He said the vehicles were stripped-down
models built to ``Africa specifications'' to endure rough
conditions. Some have been modified as ambulances or fitted with
armor and ballistic floor mats to protect occupants if they go over
a land mine.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have just started to get a toehold in the
business. Three years ago, for instance, Schein Pharmaceutical
Inc., a generic-drug producer based in Florham Park, N.J., hired
Allison Formal, a former official with International Services for
Medical Services for Health, a relief group, to help sell drugs to
humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Formal said Schein, in some cases, had given drugs at cost
to relief groups to build up relationships. But typically, the
company charges from 12 to 30 percent above a drug's production
cost, she added. Drugs sold to commercial wholesale buyers
typically cost at least twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies in the disaster market must sell products to
charities at a steep discount because they are competing against
United Nations agencies, which buy huge quantities directly from
manufacturers and pass the savings along.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, sales to humanitarian groups are about 1 percent of
Schein's annual sales, or about $5 million, Ms. Formal said.
</P>
<P>
   Donated medical supplies, which are desperately needed in crises
like Kosovo, can cause their own problems for aid groups. A 1997
article in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated that it
would cost the World Health Organization about $2,000 a ton to
destroy the hundreds of tons of expired drugs and unusable medical
supplies sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina during the conflict there.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a pharmaceutical company must destroy expired drugs in
a hazardous waste incinerator, an expensive form of disposal.
</P>
<P>
   A WHO guideline now calls for donated medical supplies to be no
less than a year away from expiration. But Max Ziv, a pharmacist
working at Genpharm Inc., a generic drug maker in Toronto, said in
a telephone interview that he had been giving charities drugs with
a shelf life of six months.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ziv and Genpharm president Bruce Simpson said they were
unaware of the WHO guideline but defended the practice, saying the
drugs were good. Genpharm is a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, a German
company that is not related to Merck &AMP; Co., the U.S. drug giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a moral issue,'' Ziv said. ``Would you rather see people
in the Third World dying because they need medicines?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, the Vietnamese government burned about 1,000
pounds of expired Genpharm antibiotics and drugs that Ziv had
collected and donated. He said the drugs were no older than six
months from expiration when they reached Vietnam in March.
Government officials destroyed the drugs last fall, according to
news reports.
</P>
<P>
   As the Kosovo crisis continues, some sellers of tents are
apparently seeking to unload products of little use to refugees.
Normally, such products are made by specialized factories, said
Urwin, the buyer with Crown Agents. In recent weeks, he said that
some tent producers that normally did not serve the relief market
tried to sell him expensive tents designed for campers. The
problem: the tents are too small for people to stand inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fine if you are looking to spend a weekend in the
mountains or on the beach,'' Urwin said.
</P>
<P>
   And even products designed for refugees are not always right for
the situation. Addis, the Catholic Relief official, said some of
the tents delivered to Stankovic I, a sprawling refugee camp
outside Skopje, do not have floors because they were produced for
Africa, where it is hot and relatively dry. As a result, the
charity has bought plastic sheeting to serve as tent bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Addis said, his experience with companies in the
disaster business had been good. Not long after surveying the needs
of the 30,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees at the Stankovic camp, he
decided to bring in military-style field kitchens to cook hot meals
for thousands of them at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But when he looked into buying that number of new kitchens,
Addis said he quickly found that the cost was steep and that new
kitchens would take six to eight weeks to get to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   He alerted Spitzfaden of Tri-Med of the problem, and the
procurement company found a surplus dealer that had 22 used NATO
field kitchens. Catholic Relief Service bought the kitchens,
utensils included, for $9,000 each and shipped them immediately to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Tri-Med's markup was, Addis figures he got a deal. It
would have cost him $1 million, about five times what he paid, to
buy 22 new kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we got a good price,'' he said. &QL;

A MONTE CARLO DIRECTOR GAMBLES ON NOVELTY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Christopher Reardon's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was
about the choreographers Danial   Shapiro and Joanie Smith. 
By CHRISTOPHER REARDON  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its Mediterranean vistas and posh casinos, the little
principality of Monaco has reigned for generations as a playground
for the rich and famous. It's not all fun and games, though, for
Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, a local troupe that spent 48 weeks
rehearsing and performing last year.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Jean-Christophe Maillot, an amiable young Frenchman with
big ambitions, this 14-year-old company is striving to reconcile
its loyalty to tradition with a passion for something new.
</P>
<P>
   It seems fitting that the company will take up this theme when
it opens a weeklong season at City Center in New York City on
Wednesday. The program spotlights Maillot's sleek new rendering of
``Romeo and Juliet,'' set to Prokofiev's familiar rhapsodic score.
Framed as a flashback and focusing on psychological tensions, the
three-act work brings a fresh eye to a story that is often
freighted with props and pantomime.
</P>
<P>
   It also renews Maillot's efforts to couple classical ballet with
contemporary dance, two clans that have sometimes quarreled as
ardently as the Montagues and the Capulets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aim is to take the classical world _ its codes, its
esthetic, its dancers _ and find a new approach,'' he said during a
recent interview in New York. ``The alternative to classical dance
is not automatically modern dance. There are other propositions
which are more subtle and, for me, more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Princess Caroline asked him to direct Les Ballets de Monte
Carlo six years ago, Maillot has gained a reputation for
challenging the dance establishment. In 1996, for the troupe's only
previous New York engagement, he juxtaposed Balanchine's ``Four
Temperaments'' with his own dance to the same score by Paul
Hindemith. Although he seemed to be inviting unfavorable
comparisons, many critics commended his gutsy choice.
</P>
<P>
   With his new ``Romeo et Juliette,'' Maillot has once more thrust
himself into some lofty company. Leonid Lavrovsky, John Cranko,
Jerome Robbins and Kenneth MacMillan are among more than 80
choreographers who have taken inspiration from Shakespeare's
star-crossed lovers.
</P>
<P>
   (American Ballet Theater will perform the MacMillan version,
which also uses the Prokofiev score, at the Metropolitan Opera
House through Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   Maillot said he found much to admire in these productions, but
he questioned their emotional resonance with young audiences today.
His staging owes less to Cranko and MacMillan, he said, than to
Franco Zeffirelli's impassioned 1968 film and Baz Luhrmann's
turbo-charged 1996 remake.
</P>
<P>
   In a makeover that's not just cosmetic, Maillot replaced the
heavy period look with strapless gowns (by Jerome Kaplan),
otherworldly light (by Dominique Drillot) and a shifting psychic
landscape (by Ernest Pignon-Ernest).
</P>
<P>
   The central narrative role belongs to Friar Laurence, usually a
character of little depth. His culpability and distance, however,
led Maillot to depict him as a failed peacemaker who punctuates the
ballet with expressive bursts of moral anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one I want the audience to identify most strongly
with,'' the choreographer said. ``Not Romeo, and not Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece presumes that theatergoers know the basic story: two
lovers, their feuding families, a tragic miscommunication. So
instead of having to dramatize each plot twist, Maillot said, he
felt free to create a sequence of character studies.
</P>
<P>
   When Tybalt and Mercutio duel, for example, he skips the
swordplay in favor of a fiery pas de deux. And while MacMillan lets
the wounded Mercutio caper about for three minutes before dying, he
gives the musical passage to Romeo (Chris Roelandt), who is
transformed from a docile lover into a vengeful murderer.

 UNDATED: vengeful murderer.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most significantly, the third act brings the Friar (Gaetan
Morlotti) into the bedroom and later the crypt for a pair of
lengthy, hypnotic duets with Juliet (Bernice Coppieters). Maillot
said the scheme served both to implicate the Friar and to advance
the narrative without relying on props.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no swords, no poison vial,'' he said. ``Their
dancing will tell us who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's tale of forbidden love has had a hold on Maillot,
who is now 38, for nearly half his life. In 1983, as a soloist with
the Hamburg Ballet, he wrenched his knee while rehearsing the part
of Romeo in John Neumeier's version of the ballet.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, shortly before opening night, ended his career as a
dancer. Moving back to his hometown, Tours, in France's Loire
Valley, he signed on as director of a 12-member troupe and began
making dances.
</P>
<P>
   His hybrid esthetic (``evolution, not revolution'') endeared him
neither to classicism's ancien regime nor to iconoclastic peers
like Maguy Marin, Jean-Claude Gallotta and Daniel Larrieu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my role is to give the people in the audience partly
what they expect,'' he said, citing his new work's familiar story
and score. ``Now, once they are in their seats, my job is to not to
completely shock them but maybe to destabilize them a little bit,
to bring them to be curious, to begin wondering if there are other
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Maillot's first forays into choreography was an 80-minute
piece called ``Juliette et Romeo.'' (His first child, born that
same year, is also named Juliette.) He commissioned an electronic
score and, as with the other dances he made before going to Monte
Carlo, kept the dancers off point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just too young,'' he said. ``I didn't have the rights to
the score by Prokofiev, and I didn't have the quality of dancers
that I have today. But dramaturgically everything was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since going to Monte Carlo _ he lives with his family in nearby
Nice _ Maillot has replaced all but a few of the troupe's 50
dancers. One of the newcomers, Morlotti, followed him from Ballet
de Tours.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring the troupe plans to leave the belle epoque studio
and stage where Diaghilev's legendary Ballets Russes was based from
1911 and 1929. ``It's very nice historically, but otherwise it's
terrible,'' Maillot said. ``There are three showers for 50 dancers.
People told me that Diaghilev used to do everything there. I said:
`Yes, he also used to not pay the dancers. You want us to do that
also?'''
</P>
<P>
   In its new home, the troupe will enjoy the use of three large
studios plus a weight room, sauna and whirlpool. It will perform at
the new 1,800-seat Grimaldi Forum, named for the family that has
ruled Monaco for seven centuries. The building costs, like the
troupe's $5.5 million annual budget, are being covered by the
principality.
</P>
<P>
   Maillot said the best choreography is transparent, leaving the
viewer with palpable emotions, not pretty images. ``I want the
audience to come away from the balcony scene and not remember one
step,'' he said. ``Romeo and Juliet should be so much in love that
when the curtain closes you feel like, `Wow! I would like to live
that.'''

ISRAELI TROOPS WOUND 17 IN HEBRON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABU DIS, West Bank _ It was to be the dawn of an independent
Palestinian state, but Tuesday ended up just another day on the
edge of peace.
</P>
<P>
   After Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat postponed a unilateral
declaration of statehood on May 4 _ the day set out in accords with
Israel for the completion of a final peace deal _ clashes broke out
in the West Bank. Israeli troops shot and wounded at least 17
protesters in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seized the opportunity
to boost his bitterly fought campaign for reelection by saying his
government's hard-line position forced Arafat to back down. And
Palestinian leaders reiterated their vow that Palestinian statehood
is inevitable in the future ``whether the Israeli government likes
it or not,'' as Palestinian Authority general secretary, Ahmed
Abdel-Rahman, put it.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from the politics, and a small group of young people
who threw rocks at Israeli soldiers, the Palestinian people _ from
struggling businessmen to fed-up mothers _ showed surprising
indifference as the date, which Arafat had called ``sacred,''
slipped by. They seemed to understand the international pressure
that led Arafat to delay, and largely agreed with his decision.
What they said they care about is the practical side of peace _
developing an economy and improving public works.
</P>
<P>
   They expressed impatience with the Palestinian Authority for
failing to deliver basic services they need, for violating civil
rights of Palestinians, and for rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Nabil Safadi, 34, who owns a small Gaza
factory that makes bamboo furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me a real Palestinian state will be when we, as business
people, have the right to import and export our goods,'' said
Safadi.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that his imports of bamboo are often delayed in
Israeli ports, and that when Israel closes the borders, which it
would certainly do if Arafat unilaterally declared statehood,
deliveries don't come through at all. That means his 25 employees
do not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the real frustration. The peace process has never
produced the economic benefits it promised, and a piece of paper
that says we are a state will do nothing to change that,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority may issue Palestinian passports, have
its own postage stamps, and even have its own airport in Gaza. But
many see those as the trappings of a state, and far from the true
benefits of independence.
</P>
<P>
   But in Gaza, at the Shatti UN Refugee Camp, where 55,000 live in
cinder-block hovels with corrugated tin roofs, the frustration is
growing. Half of Gaza's 1.2 million people still live in the
squalor of camps where sewerage is inadequate and water shortages
are a daily occurence in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
   Rabiha Salem, 47, and her daughter, Wafa, 20, took shelter from
a blazing sun in the camp in a thin line of shade along a
garbage-strewn alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``More important than the words of a declaration of statehood
are the things we need to live our lives,'' said Rabiha, whose
husband and two sons, both in their early 20s, are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent years and years fighting for nothing. What we need is
housing, and schools, and factories. We need a future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A construction site in Abu Dis, straddling Jerusalem, is an apt
metaphor for the promise, and failure, of a Palestinian state. When
work began three years ago, the site was intended to be the future
seat of government in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians see as the
capital of a future state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Palestinian officials are evasive when asked about the
purpose of the building. But Abu Usama, 50, the supervisor of the
construction, Tuesday showed a reporter a large terraced conference
center that he said is ``designed for 180 seats for the Palestinian
parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he proudly walked to the half-built, seven-story
``government office building'' next door and showed a large room
which he said would be ``the office of the prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost of the Palestinian Authority-funded project
is $10 million, he said, and it is one year behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   No windows have been installed, but a hole in a seventh story
wall looked out on a commanding view of Jerusalem's Kidron Valley
and the magnificent golden Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem's Old
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud when I see this view,'' said Abu Usama. ``It
tells me that we are building a state, and that its capital will be
in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Daoud Hanafsi, an unemployed construction worker who lives in
Abu Dis, saw the building as a different kind of symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Arafat's state,'' he said, pointing to the
construction site, ``unfinished, over-budget, and full of
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanafsi said his village of Abu Dis, which remains under Israeli
security but Palestinian civil control, suffers from deep poverty.
There is no hospital, schools are crumbling, and unemployment soars
over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a state means dealing with those problems,'' he said.
``Not waving a piece of paper before the world that declares
statehood.''

FIDELITY TO OFFER AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS TO SOME CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a powerful marketing alliance that unites two
financial services giants and signals growing convergence between
investment service companies, Fidelity Investments said Tuesday it
would offer American Express credit cards to its brokerage
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, which brings together the nation's largest mutual
fund firm and the world's leading credit card issuer, allows
Fidelity to offer an American Express gold card sporting the
Fidelity Investments name to brokerage clients beginning in June.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity will provide a single, consolidated monthly statement
that includes card charges and waive the card's $75 annual fee. To
qualify, clients must have brokerage account balances of at least
$30,000. American Express Co. will debit purchases directly from
the customer's account.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's ``brokerage'' account, technically known as an Ultra
Service Account, or USA, is a bit of a misnomer. It is essentially
an asset management account with check writing, direct deposit,
stock trading, investment research, and mutual fund features, all
reported on one monthly statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is best known as a fund giant. But the alliance between
Fidelity and American Express is designed to help both
household-name companies offer ``one-stop shopping'' for financial
services, from credit cards and mutual funds to checking and
on-line stock trading. Alfred F. Kelly, president of American
Express's consumer card group, said the Fidelity alliance was ``a
major step in our efforts to build relationships with leading
financial services companies around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the partnership reflected a growing trend among
financial services and Internet-related companies to team up to try
to gain a greater share of the customer's wallet. Fidelity expects
to announce a major alliance with an Internet provider in coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the alliance trend, Fidelity's marketing head,
Stephen A. Cone, said Tuesday that Fidelity had already forged a
unique arrangement with 3Com Corp., the maker of Palm Pilot
personal organizers. The Series 7 Palm Pilot, to debut nationally
in July, comes preloaded with software allowing access to Fidelity
brokerage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The device will function like Fidelity's two-way pagers, which
let customers trade stocks and funds instantly. The Fidelity name
and logo will be displayed prominently on the screen of the new
Palm Pilots, which will be manufactured in the millions, Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 75 percent of Fidelity's 2.5 million brokerage
clients have American Express cards, giving the credit card issuer,
whose market share has slipped in recent years, a prime pool of
customers. Fidelity will also provide at no fee an unlimited number
of supplementary cards to brokerage clients. Around 60 percent of
Fidelity's brokerage accounts are jointly held, which could
translate into a bigger customer base.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Fidelity is hoping that the convenience of a
single monthly statement will encourage customers to consolidate
their mutual fund, banking, and credit card accounts into one
Fidelity product. About 90 percent of Fidelity's total revenues
comes from 10 percent of the firm's clients. The private firm,
which manages $806.1 billion in assets and has the nation's
second-largest discount brokerage, wants to leverage more business
out of its top customers and stronger revenue at a time of falling
fund sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Express alliance is a critical step in Fidelity's
plan to attract and retain top clients,'' said Eric M. Kobren,
publisher of the independent Fidelity Insight newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity will offer a platinum American Express card beginning
in July and reduce the $300 annual fee to $225.
</P>
<P>
   While the two companies spoke in glowing terms of the venture,
under which they will share revenues and expenses, they declined to
provide profit projections.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity currently offers a direct-debit Visa card. Fidelity
customers will have to choose between the American Express and Visa
cards. Cone, a former American Express executive, said Fidelity
planned to promote its American Express relationship in a current
campaign devoted to its on-line brokerage but would not put much
marketing muscle behind its Visa arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is considering offering its Advisor fund family, sold
through third-party channels, to American Express's financial
advisory arm, which has a captive sales force. American Express has
smaller credit card ventures with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and
CIBC Oppenheimer &AMP; Co. but does not promote them heavily.

TORNADO DEVASTATION EVOKES MEMORY OF ANOTHER DAY OF TERROR IN
OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rubble _ and who might be under it _ triggers the worst
memories for Frank Koch, a veteran Oklahoma City policeman and an
up-close witness to terror.
</P>
<P>
   Just over four years ago, Koch began the first of 17 consecutive

   Koch said Tuesday that he is prepared to return to the rubble,
this time left by massive tornadoes that ripped through Oklahoma
and Kansas on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Like four years ago, Koch said, the Oklahoma City area ``looks
like a war zone. And knowing there might still be victims in the
rubble makes it just like with the Murrah building ... We're going
to have to go through each home and look piece by piece for any
survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Koch, Jannie Coverdale said she has never forgotten what
happened on April 19, 1995, when 168 people died in the bombing.
But this week's tragedy, she said, brings back even more vividly
the memory of those late-evening storms and tornado warnings in
1995 that delayed discovery of her grandsons, Aaron, 5, and Elijah,
2, inside the Murrah building.
</P>
<P>
   The two boys were among the 19 children killed by the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God is trying to tell Oklahoma City something,''
Coverdale said. ``I think he's trying to say we need to change the
way we're living. We need to become closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there is an overwhelming sense of sadness and loss
drifting through Oklahoma. But the anger, so prevalent in the
aftermath of the OKC bomb, has not resurfaced, say Koch and
Coverdale.
</P>
<P>
   The fury of a tornado, an act of God, they say, cannot compare
to the hatred and meanness exhibited by Timothy McVeigh and Terry
Nichols, the convicted architects of the Murrah bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing was mass murder,'' Coverdale said, while ``the
tornadoes were not something that human beings did.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Koch: ``We can't blame this on God; It's just one of those
things that happened.''

TORNADO DEVASTATION EVOKES MEMORY OF ANOTHER DAY OF TERROR IN
OKLAHOMA

<P>
   The rubble _ and who might be under it _ triggers the worst
memories for Frank Koch, a veteran Oklahoma City policeman and an
up-close witness to terror.
</P>
<P>
   Just over four years ago, Koch began the first of 17 consecutive
days inside the twisted and torn Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building,
pulling out people. Some were still alive, others dead and
dismembered by a bomb made of diesel fuel and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said Tuesday that he is prepared to return to the rubble,
this time left by massive tornadoes that ripped through Oklahoma
and Kansas on Monday.

   Kathleen Treanor said she was blaming no one when she huddled
with her family in the basement of her Oklahoma home Monday night.
Instead, as tornadoes danced around her, Treanor said she thought
of her 4-year-old daughter, Ashley, a bombing casualty.
</P>
<P>
   She said she remembers the wait she had to endure before
learning her daughter was dead. ``I'm sure there are quite a few
people out there that are looking for family and are going to have
to wait,'' Treanor said. ``My heart just breaks for them because I
know what they're feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes, like the bombing, have brought out the good in
people, Koch said. ``We might be in the middle of Tornado Alley,
but we're also in the Bible Belt ... We're all helping one another.
Even the criminals are taking a break _ just like they did during
the Murrah building'' blast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Tomlin, whose husband, Rick, died in the explosion, said
many of this week's tornado victims were there when she and other
bombing victims needed their support. ``Now it's our turn,'' Tomlin
said, to return the favor.

AFTER SHUNNING NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT, HASSAN RECEIVES ISRAELI
DELEGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARRAKESH, Morocco _ After three years of shunning the Israeli
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, King Hassan II of
Morocco has returned to the role of potential Middle East
intermediary by receiving a delegation of 50 Israeli legislators,
religious leaders and businessmen at the royal palace in Marrakesh.
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old king was a key intermediary in negotiations
between Israel and its Palestinian and Arab adversaries over nearly
25 years from the early 1970s. But he froze his contacts with
Israel after the Netanyahu government took power and adopted a
hard-line approach toward carrying out the 1993 accords between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the king's new initiative prompted criticism from
some in Israel, who suggested that Hassan was trying to influence
the Israeli election on May 17. Most members of the Israeli
delegation received by the king belong to Israel's large and
politically influential community of Moroccan Jews, many of whom
have supported Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party in the past.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli polls pointing to a close battle between Netanyahu
and Ehud Barak, the leader of the opposition Labor Party, a small
shift in voting patterns among the 500,000 Jews of Moroccan origin
could influence the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception in the Marrakesh palace on Monday night, Hassan
appeared sensitive to the charge that he was interfering in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never interfered in Israel's internal affairs, and I
have no wish to interfere in your election now,'' he said. ``All
that I would ask is that you vote for an idea, the idea of peace.
Israel and the Arab nations need peace, and you must do whatever
you can to help achieve that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, a trade minister in the Netanyahu Cabinet and a
leader of Israel's Russian immigrants, said the king had allayed
concerns that he might be seeking to sway the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the private meeting, he told us four times, I'm not trying
to tell you how to vote,'' Sharansky said. ``So I think even those
who saw this as an attempt to interfere have realized that the king
has much longer-term goals, in terms of reviving the peace process
and offering himself as a possible intermediary.''  &QL;

TRAMPING FOR RAMPS, A SURE SIGN OF SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: W.Va., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENSSELAERVILLE, N.Y. _ Bill Bensen, the chef of the Palmer
House Cafe here, was tramping through the woods two weeks ago,
searching for signs of green ramp tips breaking the frosty ground
cover, insisting that spring had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   He was still layered in polar fleece and a parka, his breath
forming wisps in the chilly air. Even so, he was mentally composing
dishes for his annual Rampage, the almost-all-ramp menu served each
spring in his 20-seat cafe in this upstate hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``See! Over there! The green!'' he yelled, jumping up and down,
either in excitement or for warmth. ``When it gets a little warmer
in that dell, this whole place will smell like onions!''
</P>
<P>
   Let the meek extol the virtues of mild-mannered cultivated
leeks. Real cooks forage for ramps. The leafy, bulbous, aromatic
plants, the wild cousins of leeks, sprout in rich forest soil from
Canada to Georgia, and as far west as Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Ramps have more heat and bite than leeks or scallions and, when
cooked, a soft nutty taste rarely found in either garlic or onions.
</P>
<P>
   Ramps tend to cluster near groves of sugar maples. Foragers like
Bensen know better than to try to pick a ramp. Their root systems
are so deep and entwined that only a shovel can scoop six inches
beneath the earth and loosen a clump of ramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know three things for sure,'' he said as he knelt to clear
frost and old leaves and pine needles from one of his favorite ramp
patches. ``First, ramps on the perimeter of the patch are usually
bigger. Secondly, they can look like lily of the valley, which are
poisonous, so if the plant doesn't smell like onion, don't eat it.
And the third thing I know is that for every ramp I dig, two more
come the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lexicographers say the word ``ramp'' was Middle English for
wild garlic, others say for wild leeks. But people around here say
the similarity to ``tramp'' explains the name. The tramping and
digging, cleaning and cooking required to turn muddy,
garlic-smelling bulbs and their leafy greens into a toothsome
delicacy play no small role in ramp mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Bensen walks about a mile into a rocky forest in the Helderberg
Mountains and digs for about an hour to get a bushel of dirt-caked
ramps (32 quarts), which need to be trimmed of their roots and
outer sheaths, then soaked in cold water and rinsed repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about two hours to clean and cook a bushel of ramps,
and the hunter-gatherer is left with only two to four cups of
cooked greens. About 55 ramps make a pound; when cooked, they will
serve three people as a side dish or an ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   But the triumph of emerging from the dark woods, a ramp-filled
bushel basket balanced on the end of a shovel, makes all the effort
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Ramp-rich places tend to be isolated little hamlets like
Rensselaerville, and many of them celebrate the aromatic delicacy
with festivals in springtime like Bensen's Rampage. The Ramp Romp
in Helvetia, W.Va., is probably the best-known revel, serving up
ramp chili, ramp home fries, ramp omelets, ramp pie, batter-fried
ramps, scalloped ramps and potatoes, ramp slaw, and corn-bread
sandwiches with pulled pork and raw ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Similar dishes can be found in Elks' lodges and church basements
throughout Appalachia and New England, and parts of the Midwest and
the South, from late March to mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs in cities tend to take a more sophisticated tack with
ramps, which are heaped high in bunches in the Union Square
Greenmarket in Manhattan at this time of year. Union Square Cafe
features a gratin of ramps, potatoes and Gruyere cheese; Home
offers ramp and mint pesto; Verbena serves blini with grilled
ramps, and Gotham Bar and Grill serves farfalle with ramps, cremini
mushrooms, pea shoots, Parmesan and white truffle oil.
</P>
<P>
   Ramps are often braised in wine or grilled, but that robs them
of their full nutty flavor. It blooms only when they are covered
with olive oil, braised until tender and allowed to rest in a
covered dish. Rural cooks use pork or goose fat instead.
</P>
<P>
   After they are braised, ramps can be served in a vinaigrette,
laid onto pizza or added to pasta or risotto. The oil or fat they
have flavored can then add a blast of spring-in-the-woods to shad
or shad roe, chicken, game or shellfish _ although you won't
usually see much shellfish in places where you see lots of ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Bensen's Rampage last weekend was the sort of event that
celebrates one of the things that tiny hill towns hold in common.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 guests, who ate family style _ johnnycakes with wilted
ramps and creme fraiche; scalloped ramps and potatoes topped with
shad roe; a spring ragout of ramps with spinach, fiddlehead ferns
and morels, topped with chicken from the Palmer House Cafe smoker _
were in complete accord: ramps are worth the work.

   RAMPS BRAISED IN OLIVE OIL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 50 minutes, plus 10 minutes resting time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups olive oil, plus more if necessary
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds ramps (approximately 6 bunches), cleaned
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place olive oil in a large, shallow pan with a tight-fitting
lid over high heat. When oil is warm, roll a bunch of ramps in
paper towels to remove excess moisture, and unwrap. Reduce heat to
medium and add ramps to pan. Toss to coat each leaf with oil.
Working quickly, dry second bunch and add to oil, tossing until
ramps wilt. Continue with remaining ramps, adding more oil if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   2. When all ramps are wilted, season to taste and reduce heat to
low, then stir and cover pot. Cook 5 to 10 minutes, depending on
the size of the ramps, stirring frequently to avoid burning. When
ramps are very, very tender, remove pan from heat and let sit,
covered, for 10 minutes. Season again if desired, and serve.

<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups arborio rice
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken or vegetable broth or water, warmed

<P>
   1. Cut off ramp bulbs. Thinly slice greens and chop bulbs
coarsely. Reserve about 2 tablespoons bulb.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place a heavy pot over medium-high heat and warm olive oil.
Add chopped ramp bulbs and greens. Toss quickly to soften, about 2
minutes. Add rice and stir for several minutes. Add wine, stir and
cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Begin adding the warmed broth, a cup or so at a time,
stirring and cooking for 5 to 15 minutes between additions. When
rice has lost its rock-hard center, add spring greens. Stir and add
the reserved ramp bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   4. When greens have wilted, add butter and half the cheese.
Taste. Each grain of rice should have a firm center, and the
mixture should be soupy. If necessary, add more water or broth and
cook a few minutes, stirring occasionally. Add thyme, season with
salt and pepper and serve, garnished with remaining grated cheese.

MORALES SUBPOENAED IN TOBACCO FEE CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General John Cornyn has subpoenaed his
predecessor, Dan Morales, to possibly testify in a federal court
hearing Thursday about the role that a Morales friend played in
Texas' lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Morales is fighting the subpoena, which was issued last week but
wasn't announced until Tuesday. He wasn't available for comment.
But his attorney, Sam Millsap of San Antonio, called Cornyn's
effort to force Morales' attendance ``unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge David Folsom ruled earlier that witnesses
won't be necessary for the hearing in Texarkana, Millsap said. He
filed a motion to quash the subpoena, but Folsom hadn't ruled on
the motion late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is related to Houston lawyer Marc Murr's claim for
about $260 million in legal fees from the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has said that Murr, a longtime friend, was crucial to
the state's success in negotiating a $17.3 billion settlement from
tobacco companies last year. But other lawyers have complained that
Murr did little work on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn has said that both he and the FBI are investigating
Murr's role in the lawsuit. Millsap says the controversy stems from
``politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody from the FBI, the Justice Department or the U.S.
attorney's office has contacted Dan or me, and they know I
represent Dan,'' Millsap said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn spokesman Ted Delisi said the attorney general subpoenaed
Morales last week after Murr's lawyer, Roy Minton of Austin, told
the judge that Murr would be available to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the judge has ruled witnesses wouldn't be necessary,
Cornyn still wants Morales available for possible questioning if
Murr shows up at the hearing, as is expected, Delisi said.
</P>
<P>
   A state arbitration panel appointed by Morales and Murr awarded
Murr $260 million for work on the tobacco case last fall. But
cigarette makers are bound under the Texas agreement to pay Murr
only $1 million, which was awarded by national arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom has ordered Murr to ``show cause'' why the $260 million
arbitration award should not be dismissed because, he said, the way
the state panel was appointed violated his order.

MONUMENTS OF STONE, TESTAMENTS TO AN ISLAND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Maine, N.Y.)   (af)  
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Today the residents of Vinalhaven Island, Maine,
nestled in Penobscot Bay some 15 miles off Rockland, boast of their
lobstering industry and an aversion to tourists. But nearly a
century ago, the tiny island, roughly nine miles long and five
miles wide, had another source of pride: its cliffs and knolls
provided the granite for some of the nation's most imposing
structures, among them the Brooklyn Bridge, the United States
Custom House and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the island's quarries, and specifically the
erection of eight monumental columns in the cathedral's sanctuary,
are the subject of an exhibition lining the cathedral's photography
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eight Columns of Worship: A Tribute to Human Ingenuity and
Faith'' tells the story behind the buildings that stand as a
testament to the majesty and endurance of Vinalhaven granite. And
though the photographs and artifacts are on view only through next
Sunday, the structures themselves will live on as a kind of
three-dimensional exhibit _ one that is being documented anew by
Chester Higgins Jr., a photographer for The New York Times and an
occasional visitor to the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``My love for stone comes from my love for ancient Egyptian
architecture,'' Higgins said. ``While visiting the island I heard
that they had these quarries, and through my research I discovered
that so much of the stuff that came from the island landed in New
York. I was fascinated.''
</P>
<P>
   He set out to photograph the stone monuments whose impact on
society transcended time but whose architectural style fell out of
favor after only a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of steel and reinforced concrete replaced the massive
granite buildings,'' said Roy Heisler of the Vinalhaven Historical
Society, where the exhibition originated. ``The importance is the
legacy of the stones, and the great buildings that were produced
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Settled by fishermen in the late 18th century, Vinalhaven
reached its population peak (2,855) in 1880, when the quarries
employed some 1,500 men from New England, Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   What made Vinalhaven granite unique was not only its superb
quality and color _ a warm pinkish-gray _ but the ease with which
it could be transported off the island. By the 1850s, the Bodwell &AMP;
Webster quarry (later the Bodwell Granite Co.) had received a
number of federal contracts for reinforcements at forts along the
Atlantic and gulf coasts.
</P>
<P>
   But the demand for granite escalated enormously after the Civil
War, when a trend toward European grandeur in American architecture
sent the government scurrying for an economical but beautiful stone
to use in custom houses, post offices, dams, bridges and banks as
far west as St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The stones used in the Pennsylvania Railroad Station in
Philadelphia, the Chicago Board of Trade Building, the Executive
Office Building and part of the Washington Monument were culled
from the Vinalhaven quarries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the architect George Heins had set out in
search of the stone for the cathedral's eight columns. He
ultimately chose Bodwell's Wharff Quarry. With its 100-foot-tall
ridge of nearly flawless virgin granite, the quarry could easily
accommodate the columns' dimensions: 54 feet long and 6 feet in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
   The first block of granite, extracted in August 1899, was some
64 feet long and 8{ feet wide and weighed about 300 tons. After
being cut from the bed, each block was hewn with hand tools to
within 3 inches of a column's finished dimension. In order to turn
and polish the columns, the quarry commissioned the world's largest
lathe, a behemoth weighing 135 tons that became an overnight media
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   But disaster struck. As it neared completion, the first column
suddenly snapped in the lathe. The second and third columns soon
followed suit. By August 1901, the architects had determined that a
single block of such proportions could not withstand the pressure
of the turning on the lathe. They decided to build the columns in
two pieces: a 90-ton, 36-foot-long lower monolith and a 40-ton,
18-foot-long upper portion that could be reattached so as not to be
noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, 1903, the first two columns and their bases were
loaded for the trip to New York aboard a specially designed barge.
After being pulled through the Atlantic, into Long Island Sound and
up the Hudson River, the barge arrived at the West 134th Street
pier eight days later.
</P>
<P>
   The moving and erecting of the columns is widely considered
among the world's most remarkable engineering feats. When the tide
was right, the columns were rolled off the barge using its huge
derrick, a timber hitch and an inclined plane.
</P>
<P>
   A truck with wooden wheels, pulled ahead by a powerful winch
some 300 feet at a time, then carried the column pieces through the
streets of New York to 112th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, a journey
of about two miles. It took 19 days.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a derrick made of two 96-foot lengths of Oregon pine
and powered by three steam engines was constructed to swing the
columns into place atop the bases. By Nov. 25, 1904, all eight
columns were in position, waiting for the walls to be built around
them.
</P>
<P>
   The onset of modern construction techniques put an end to major
quarrying in 1918, but paving blocks continued to be exported until
1939. Aside from a smattering of rusty pieces of machinery, the
only existing evidence of Vinalhaven's legacy is a single column.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a flawed column, remaining right on the shore,'' Heisler
said. ``It's overgrown, but its meaning is fairly evident.''

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aside from her spiky frosted hair, it was hard to
pick out Amy Brewer in the two dozen or so black-clad dancers at
the Broadway Dance Center strutting, twirling and kicking, doing
the same routine 8, 10, 12, 14 times to the 30-second finale of
Natalie Cole's ``Orange-Colored Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Allison Ellner-Teitelbaum, who owns the five-floor studio
that is ground zero for New York dance, saw something she liked
amid the symphony of black spandex and high-heeled Capezio
character shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oooooh,'' she said approvingly as she watched the working
dancers and the wannabes in Tony Stevens' advanced professional
theater dancing class one recent afternoon. ``Amy wheedled her way
up to the front. Good for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the front increases the likelihood of being noticed
by the teacher, who may one day be casting a show, and it denotes a
bit of chutzpah, neither of which is likely to hurt in the
ultra-competitive world of theatrical dancing.
</P>
<P>
   After years of decline, as the gold standard on Broadway became
song and drama mega-shows like ``Phantom of the Opera'' or ``Les
Miserables'' and the great choreographer-directors of the past
departed, it is suddenly a fertile time for dancers on Broadway.
Dance thrives in ``Chicago'' and ``Fosse,'' which feature classic
Bob Fosse choreography by the theater's top dancers; in the
youthful sweat-athon ``Footloose,'' and in shows as diverse as
``Ragtime,'' ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain logic for the resurgence of dancers. In an
age of body lust, the long, lean ``Chicago'' dancers on the ads
running the length of city buses have the best-toned abs and thighs
around. And in the cyclical rhythms of Broadway fashion, dance has
been out so long, it is probably time for it to be in.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see them with their turned-out duck feet, baggy
pants, pulled-back hair and backpacks showing up to teach or take
classes at the Broadway Dance Center on West 57th Street. You can
find them going in for the dancer's best friend, physical tuneups
at Performing Arts Physical Therapy or West Side Chiropractic. You
can spot them, at least the younger ones, after shows having a
glass of wine or a martini at Arriba Arriba, Barrymore's, Joe Allen
or the other theater-district hangouts.
</P>
<P>
   The life is too diffuse and tribal _ each show its own world _
to allow much in the way of shared experience aside from the aches
and pains and economic uncertainty. What they have in common is an
almost blindingly intense devotion to their craft and a realization
that few careers provide less of a secure foothold on status and
security than dancing for a living in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of dance going on now, but there are a lot more
good dancers too; they're well trained and they look great,'' said
Jane Lanier, a featured dancer in ``Fosse'' who has been dancing
professionally since 1983, when she was 21. ``So there's
opportunity, but unless you're totally committed, this is a crazy
choice. You would never want to try it unless it's something you
almost felt that you had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brewer, a 22-year-old from Seattle who arrived in New York
last July, represents life at the bottom of the dance food chain.
She lives with three friends _ a dancer, a singer-actress and a
theater technician _ in a $1,200-a-month three-bedroom apartment in
Astoria and works at a Starbucks coffee shop and as an usher at
``The Lion King.'' She came as part of an internship at the
Broadway Dance Center, where about 4,500 people take lessons each
week for $12.50 apiece. The internship allowed her to take 10
classes a week for six months, and she now takes about five, part
of a work-study program.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at age 4, Ms. Brewer grew up doing ballet, tap, jazz
dancing, baton twirling and the rest. She got hooked on Broadway
dancing after turning on the Rosie O'Donnell show and seeing the
cast of ``Chicago'' with Bebe Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my dream show,'' she said. ``Since I've been here I've
seen it about 15 times. Can I do that? Well, I know I've got to get
better. But I don't feel that I can't do that. I feel my time will
come. You have to feel that way if you want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   If she succeeds, it will not be just because of the way she
dances.
</P>
<P>
   First, almost no one makes it as just a dancer these days.
Nearly everyone has to sing, act and dance, be what's dutifully
called a triple threat. Second, Ms. Brewer is already learning that
who you know on the dance floor can mean as much as how you dance
on it. This is not necessarily invoked cynically. It is assumed
that no one works, particularly in the top shows, unless their
dancing is first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also assumed that with a glut of talent,
choreographers are most likely to pick dancers they know. That
means the dancers will know what the choreographer wants and the
choreographer will know the work habits and personality of the
dancers. It is no accident that Stevens' next class _ the day
before he stages an audition _ is completely jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all theatrical dance careers lead to Broadway.
Between growing music video production in Los Angeles and show
tours, young dancers often chart career paths that owe little to
the world of ``A Chorus Line.'' One of the more vivid presences at
the Broadway Dance Center is Glenn Douglas Packard, a 27-year-old
with streaked hair, the son of a Michigan dairy farmer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Packard runs a talent agency and markets himself by cooking up
cover stories for Dance Spirit magazine. He has done tours or shows
in Norway, Hawaii and Japan, was part of a troupe that danced for
the King of Morocco and is part of a show being put together by
singer Jimmy Buffett. He is the dancer as entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like variety,'' he said. ``I'd be bored on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   For those with more traditional aspirations, the road to
Broadway begins with endless lessons in childhood and leads through
television commercials, theme parks, industrial shows and cruise
ships where the idea is both to dance and to oversee the
shuffleboard game.
</P>
<P>
   Some take a different path. Bernard Dotson, who dances in
``Ragtime,'' got a business degree and was working in a corporate
job in Los Angeles 13 years ago when he decided that what he really
wanted to do was dance. He started taking 12 dance classes a week,
got a job six months later in a show doing a three-month European
tour and has been working steadily ever since.
</P>
<P>
   A more typical story, if any dancer's life is typical, is that
of Serena Soffer, who dances in ``Footloose.'' She grew up in
Edison, N.J. Her father was a used-car salesman, and her mother had
been an acrobat and contortionist in a German circus. Ms. Soffer
began dancing at age 3, got her Actors' Equity card at 10 and
entered the dancers' purgatory of industrial shows, where teams of
dancers hop planes to Florida or Las Vegas to do 15-minute shows 9
or 10 times a day at conventions and trade shows for a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make thousands of dollars, but it's a nightmare,'' said
Ms. Soffer, who has a Medusa's head of blond hair and carries her
gear in a pink Rugrats bag. ``You get off the plane, and it's cold
and strenuous on your body, and you have to do these shows over and
over, selling a fabric or pushing a product. I've never done theme
parks, but they're about the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Her break came when she was hired by A.C. Ciulla for a cabaret
show, ``Hollywood to Broadway,'' which ran for almost two years at
the Tatou Supper Club on the East Side. When Ciulla was hired for
``Footloose,'' he brought her and two other dancers with him.
</P>
<P>
   Now she sleeps until 11 or so every day, spends her days
cooking, taking classes, working on other dance projects or going
to physical therapy, then shows up for work each evening to do the
show.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the food chain are the dancers in ``Chicago'' and
``Fosse,'' many of them the best-known and most skilled dancers of
their generation. Elizabeth Parkinson and Scott Wise, two of the
featured dancers in ``Fosse,'' share both a job and a life. They
plan to marry in June.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Broadway after a career with the Joffrey Ballet,
Feld Ballet and Donald Byrd. Broadway, she says, is like a parallel
universe to ballet, with its own rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``In ballet, you have to keep a higher level technically, so in
one way it's physically more demanding,'' said Ms. Parkinson, who
at 25 is the youngest dancer in ``Fosse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But dancing on Broadway demands more on a performance level.
You can't get away with just being technically amazing the way you
can in ballet. You really have to perform. The individual
performance can be more difficult in ballet, but you don't do it
eight times a week, week after week, the way we do. And the way you
get your job is so different. In Broadway your role is assigned
before you start the work process. In ballet you're a member of a
company, so you're always competing for roles. There's a lot more
angst in ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise, who at 40 has been dancing for 36 years, has won two Tonys
and was nominated for a third this week for featured actor in a
musical. He is one of Broadway's best-known male dancers, with
credits including ``Victor/Victoria,'' ``State Fair,'' ``Damn
Yankees,'' ``Guys and Dolls,'' ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' and ``A
Chorus Line.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, dancers have it better now than they did in the
past, he said. ``The shoes are better, the stages are better, they
have sprung floors that can really save your knees, back and
ankles,'' he said. ``Dancers have more protection, pregnancy
leaves, things you didn't have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wise is not sure Broadway will ever take the same risks with
dance or see the same kind of commanding choreographer-directors of
the past like Fosse or Robbins or Michael Bennett. And he thinks
the tempestuous autocrats of the past demanded a consistently
higher level than choreographers now do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more corporate and much more expensive now,'' he
said. ``Dance is hard to sell at a producing table. You can read a
script or sing a song, but it's not easy to get people in costumes
dancing around. The way the machine is built right now, I'm not
sure that even if you had a Fosse or a Bennett, they'd be able to
get their work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Dancers, like most people, may be prone to nostalgia. But what
Wise seems to miss is not just an era but also a sensibility, the
passing of Broadway's ``gypsies,'' veteran dancers who flitted from
show to show. Now dancers tend to stay with a show for two or three
years, then sometimes do it on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you would do a couple of shows a year at
least,'' Wise said. ``It was taboo to stay on a show for more than
a year. It was as if you couldn't get another job. Now because
shows are so expensive and there are fewer of them, people do shows
for two, two and a half, three years. Producers don't like it if
you leave, and they make it contractually harder to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, as ever, a tough way to live. Dancers remain at the low
end of Broadway's pecking order in pay and in status. They are
always one injury away from being out of work. And in a culture
obsessed with youth, no one hears the clock tick louder than they
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of aches and pains, and you have to learn to
pace yourself,'' said Ms. Soffer, s 29. ``There's a dancer in my
show who is 17, she's absolutely brilliant, and I have to realize I
can't always keep up with the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Fosse'' and ``Chicago'' feature mature
dancers, most of them well on the other side of 30. Ms. Lanier, for
example, struts her stuff in ``Fosse'' while raising two young
children. And though the heyday of Fosse, Robbins or Bennett
musicals is gone, many see the current popularity of dance as an
encouraging sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balanchine is gone, but at some point another choreographer
like Balanchine will come along,'' said Ann Reinking, choreographer
of ``Chicago'' and co-director and co-choreographer of ``Fosse.''
``It's the same on Broadway. It might take 50 years, it might take
5. But in the meantime there's incredibly good work for us to dance
and explore and re-explore.''

with a sore pitching elbow, that day can't come soon enough for the
Red Sox, who opened the season with five straight wins but are now
a game under .500 (12-13) for the first time as they return home to
face the Texas Rangers Wednesday at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a devastating sinker that this past winter made Lowe the
object of desire for many clubs talking trade with Sox general
manager Dan Duquette, Lowe hasn't seized the role with the ease
that some expected.
</P>
<P>
   Given his age (25) and level of experience (last season was his
first full year in the big leagues), those expectations may have
been misguided. Manager Jimy Williams is preaching patience despite
Lowe's recent travails, which include a yield of five runs last
Friday in Oakland and the inability to close out a game with a
five-run lead Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just needs one good outing, that's all,'' Williams said.
``The stuff is there. There's nothing wrong with him. Probably have
him the next time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe is not alone in a relief corps that outside of lefthander
Rheal Cormier has struggled mightily in Gordon's absence. Jim
Corsi, who has blown four saves, calls it a plague. ``It almost
doesn't matter who's out there,'' Corsi said in the aftermath of
Monday's 12-11 loss to the A's, in which the Sox blew a 7-0 lead
that was still 11-6 in the eighth. ``Something bad has been
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't made the bullpen's job any easier that the starters
have been coming up short. On the recently completed 2-5 trip, only
Pedro Martinez and Pat Rapp were able to pitch at least six
innings. Tim Wakefield has pitched a total of 15 innings in his
last four starts. Mark Portugal has lasted five and four innings in
his last two outings. Bret Saberhagen missed a start last Friday
with a sore shoulder; instead of summoning another pitcher from
Pawtucket, the Sox decided they could muddle through the weekend
with what they had.
</P>
<P>
   That idea blew up on Williams. Kip Gross was lit up early as
Saberhagen's stand-in, and Wakefield and Portugal were both KO'd
quickly, placing the bullpen in the position of having to toil 22
innings in the four games in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Overexposed and overtaxed, the Sox relievers gave up 20 earned
runs in the four games (counting Gross's three-inning, five-run
start). In that span, they allowed 20 hits while walking an
astounding 19 batters, hitting six others, and uncorking three wild
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let this snowball,'' Lowe said Monday. ``We have to
figure out individually what we're doing wrong and correct it.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying, of course, that Lowe's confidence has
taken some hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a struggle to get an out right now,'' he said. ``Before,
when I was making good pitches, outs came easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, when you're struggling, everyone starts doubting
themselves, because obviously you're doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who didn't give up a home run in 53 relief appearances
last season, already has surrendered three this year. And the
five-run yield Friday, in which A's rookie Olmedo Saenz took him
deep for a three-run home run, was the worst inning of his
big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanically, I'm all messed up,'' said Lowe, who in watching
video of his outing found that he was turning his back too far,
then springing wide open. ``Normally when I'm going good, I miss
down, but when I'm continually missing up, that tells everyone
something is mechanically wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to overanalyze it. Let it be. You want to go out
there and pitch again as soon as you can and feel aggressive. You
can't be afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the process for a young reliever-in-training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a long way to go,'' he said. ``Up to this point,
my stats have been pretty good, but I've been pitching behind (in
the count to) hitters and given up three home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get back where I was in spring training. In spring
training, I knew every time I went out there I would get people
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But the practice games ended five weeks ago. For the Sox to
right themselves, they have to be able to rely on Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I need is one good outing and I'll be right back to where
I want to be,'' Lowe said, echoing his manager. ``It doesn't take
much. But my job is to minimize the damage, and I haven't been
doing that.''

IOC PURGE ALMOST OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Except for an ongoing investigation of Australian member Phil
Coles, the International Olympic Committee's internal purge appears
to be over.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's executive committee decided Tuesday to take no further
action against board member Kim Un Yong of South Korea but will
keep Coles's case open amid fresh allegations that Salt Lake City
bidders acquired sensitive information about Sydney's bid for the
2000 Summer Games plus Coles's notes about how his colleagues might
vote in the balloting for the 2002 Winter Games site.
</P>
<P>
   Though the IOC's new outside ethics panel will look into more
than two dozen leftover cases involving members and bid cities from
other years, those alleged improprieties appear to be relatively
trivial. Most of them involve entertainment for relatives or extra
guests during visits to bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, which has expelled six members and pressured four
others to step down, had already issued severe warnings to both Kim
and Coles for their roles in the Salt Lake payoff scandal, the
worst in modern Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said there was no new evidence to justify expelling
Kim, vice president Richard Pound of Canada said the Coles inquiry
will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is now the issue is the nature of his relationship with
Salt Lake and the information that he may or may not have been
passing on,'' said Pound. ``There's enough there that we should
keep it open.''

CALIFORNIA EXECUTES VIETNAM VET FOR 1980 MURDER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Manuel Pina Babbitt, a Vietnam Veteran who was
awarded a Purple Heart while on death row, was executed early
Tuesday morning at San Quentin prison for the 1980 murder of a
78-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Gov. Gray Davis, also a Vietnam veteran, denied
Babbitt's bid for clemency, despite pleas for mercy from thousands
of veterans who believed that Babbitt's experiences during two
tours of duty in the war, particularly during the 77-day siege at
Khe Sanh, were at least partly responsible for his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, who turned 50 just hours before he was killed, became
the seventh person put to death by the state since it resumed
executions in 1992, and the second since Davis took office in
January.
</P>
<P>
   He asked that the $50 allotted for the last meal, which he
turned down, be donated to a homeless Vietnam Veteran. Prison
officials refused the request. A last-minute appeal to the Supreme
Court for a stay delayed the execution by 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt was convicted of breaking into the Sacramento apartment
of Leah Schendel in 1980 and beating her severely, causing a fatal
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested when his older brother, Bill, called police
after finding a cigarette lighter with the initials ``L.S.'' among
Babbitt's possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Babbitt, whose paranoid schizophrenia was diagnosed after
the war, when he became homeless, had said he did not remember
attacking Ms. Schendel, nor an attack the following night on
another woman who was slightly injured before a friend intervened.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers argued in appeals that he had severe post-traumatic
stress syndrome and was having a flashback to the Vietnam War when
he attacked Ms. Schendel.
</P>
<P>
   During Babbitt's 1982 trial, his lawyer, James Schenk, mentioned
post-traumatic stress syndrome but it was not the centerpiece of
his defense. In an affidavit filed with Babbitt's appeal, Schenk
said he had failed ``completely,'' most notably by failing to note
Babbitt's mental illness and his amnesia during combat.
</P>
<P>
   His appeals lawyers argued that Babbitt's flashback the night of
Ms. Schendel's death was triggered by seeing headlights in the fog
shortly before he broke into her apartment. Babbitt had said the
lights, which reminded him of aircraft lights that were always met
by enemy fire moments later, were the last thing he remembered that
night.
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt's appeals were exhausted without his receiving a
single evidentiary hearing. While on death row, Babbitt received
the Purple Heart for wounds suffered during Khe Sanh.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who watched Babbitt die were his brother Bill, and
seven members of Mrs. Schendel's family. Afterwards, the Schendel
family, which had mounted a relentless campaign over 18 years to
have Babbitt executed, expressed sympathy for his family in a
statement and said: ``It is the necessary conclusion to a horrible
crime that should never have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's last words, said San Quentin's acting warden, Jeanne
Woodfard, who walked him to his death, were: ``I forgive all of
you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers say they have developed a simple method for
estimating the risk that prostate cancer will recur and turn deadly
in men who have already had their cancerous prostates removed.
</P>
<P>
   The new method addresses troubling problems that doctors could
not resolve until now: determining a patient's risk of dying of the
disease, and deciding whether further treatment, with its
inevitable side effects, would be worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   In an article and editorial being published Wednesday in the
Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers also noted
encouraging findings for patients: prostate cancer progressed after
surgery in only a minority of patients, and often took many years
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study, hopefully, will reassure patients and physicians
that there are many men who will take many years to progress,''
said Dr. Patrick Walsh, chief of urology at Johns Hopkins
University who is an author of the study. Walsh also noted that
many men who have had surgery for prostate cancer need no further
treatment, but now receive it nonetheless, suffering side effects
needlessly. He said he hoped doctors would use the new findings to
identify men who could be spared treatment, and to identify men at
high risk who should be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barnett Kramer, of the division of cancer prevention at the
National Cancer Institute, said the study would be useful to
doctors and patients making decisions about therapy because ``it
offers different ways to individualize treatment, and gets across
the concept that not one size fits all.''
</P>
<P>
   The new method developed by Walsh and his colleagues provides
the first guidelines ever developed for men who have undergone
surgery and then had an increase in PSA, or prostate specific
antigen, a blood test that has been used for about 10 years to
screen men for prostate cancer and to determine whether the disease
has come back after treatment.
</P>
<P>
   PSA is a protein that appears in the bloodstream in men with
either enlarged prostate glands or prostate cancer. Once the
prostate is removed, the PSA level should be zero. If PSA reappears
in the blood after the prostate has been removed, which occurs in
about one-third of all patients, that means the cancer has recurred
somewhere in the body.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, in men with no other signs of disease, the
consequences of elevated PSA after surgery have been unclear.
Doctors knew that in some of those patients the disease would grow
and spread, or metastasize, whereas in others it would not. But
they could not accurately predict which group a man would fall
into.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients would ask, `What will happen?' and I couldn't tell
them,'' said Dr. Mario Eisenberger, a professor of oncology and
urology at Johns Hopkins University who is an author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberger and other doctors said that the uncertainty had
caused great worry among patients and their families. ``For a
little over a decade, we've been seeing patients with no evidence
of disease other than rising PSA after surgery or radiation,'' he
said. ``They had negative scans, and they felt terrific until they
knew what their PSA was. And then they felt real bad. It's becoming
a substantial problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard Scher, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who was not involved in the
study, said the new information would be extremely valuable because
it would reassure people that a rising PSA is not a death warrant
for all patients, and would give doctors and patients a framework
on which to base decisions about treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts estimate that 179,300 cases of prostate cancer
will be diagnosed in 1999, and 37,000 men will die from the
disease. About 100,000 operations to remove cancerous prostates
will be performed.
</P>
<P>
   The new study shows what happened to 304 men who had their
prostates removed from 1982 to 1997 and later had an increase in
PSA. In 103 men, or 34 percent, metastatic disease developed. The
researchers found that three characteristics could be used to
predict which men were more likely to have that happen: the time it
took after surgery for PSA to rise above zero, the time it
subsequently took for PSA to double, and the Gleason score, a
rating of the tumor's aggressiveness. The scale runs from 2 to 10,
with a higher score indicating a more dangerous tumor. The majority
of prostate cancers diagnosed in the United States have Gleason
scores ranging from 5 to 7, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on those factors, the researchers found that a man's
chances of being free of metastatic disease five years after
surgery could range from 86 percent to 31 percent. The men with the
highest risk were those with high Gleason scores, a rise in PSA
within two years after surgery and a doubling of PSA in less than
10 months.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists compiled their findings into a chart, or
algorithm, that doctors and patients can use to pinpoint a man's
risk of developing metastatic disease, and plan their strategy
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   An encouraging finding, the scientists said, was that many
patients with PSA elevations remained healthy for a long time. Only
34 percent developed metastatic disease during the study. And in
half, the metastases took eight or more years to occur. When the
disease did spread, half the patients were still alive after five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberger said, ``Everyone thought, `If your PSA goes up, you
die, maybe within two years.' But even in the worst case, we see
that patients live beyond five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common treatment for advanced prostate cancer is
hormonal therapy to suppress the male hormone testosterone, which
can stimulate the cancer cells. But that treatment does not cure
the cancer; rather, it can slow it down and relieve symptoms
temporarily. But it has harsh side effects, especially if taken for
a long time: breast development, hot flashes, osteoporosis, anemia
and loss of muscle mass, sex drive and mental acuity. The drugs are
also expensive, about $8,000 a year.

GUMBEL OFFICIALLY WELCCOMED TO ``CBS THIS MORNING'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the fanfare CBS could muster, including appearances by
New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and developer Donald J. Trump,
the network Tuesday heralded the return of Bryant Gumbel to morning
television as the new coanchor of ``CBS This Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy live television, and morning is the best place to do
that,'' Gumbel said during a news conference in New York that was
transmitted nationally via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel, a three-time Emmy winner who coanchored NBC's ``Today''
show from 1982 to 1997, added that he is ``very excited and
optimistic'' about the chance ``to build a program from the ground
up with an old and trusted friend,'' a reference to former
``Today'' executive producer Steve Friedman, who was put in charge
of the CBS program.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gumbel said he did not miss morning television in
the two years since he left ``Today,'' and acknowledged that it
took a while for him to come to grips with ``the idea of getting up
at 4:30 every day and doing two hours of a live broadcast . . .
It's a grind.'' With three years remaining on his $5 million-a-year
contract, Gumbel declined to specify how long he would remain with
the morning program, saying he would approach it ``a day at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about returning to mornings after a failed bid to become a
prime-time star with his canceled newsmagazine ``Public Eye With
Bryant Gumbel,'' he said: ``I don't view coming back to do
something that I enjoy as a step down.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel will begin his stint on Nov. 1 in a new,
5,000-square-foot studio on the ground floor of the Trump-managed
General Motors Building. His coanchor is expected to be named by
the end of this summer. CBS News president Andrew Heyward Tuesday
declined to say what will become of Mark McEwen and Jane Robelot,
the current coanchors of ``This Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward made clear, however, that the network will urge local
affiliates and CBS-owned stations _ such as WBZ-Ch. 4 _ to carry
the 7-to-8 a.m. hour of the Gumbel-hosted program, rather than
preempt it for local news as many currently do.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 4 general manager Ed Goldman said Tuesday he is ``very
receptive'' to surrendering the 7-to-8 a.m. hour, now devoted to
the last hour of the station's ``News Four New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said he wants to give the network ``full competitive
leverage'' in Boston as it embarks on ``one of the great things CBS
has done: getting Bryant Gumbel on its morning show.'' In addition,
Goldman predicted a ``halo effect'' of extra viewers for Channel
4's early-morning newscasts akin to that provided to NBC affiliates
by the ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel's new duties will put him in competition with his old
``Today'' colleagues. He said Tuesday that he called Matt Lauer,
who replaced him as ``Today'' coanchor, executive producer Jeff
Zucker, and weather forecaster Al Roker (no mention was made of a
call to Katie Couric).
</P>
<P>
   ``They all sincerely _ at least it sounded sincere _ wished me
luck,'' said Gumbel. ``We're not looking to run them off the road.
. . . We're looking to compete on an even keel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' may already be on its guard. Heyward quoted Couric as
directing this jab at him during a recent dinner: ``Getting a
street studio, getting Bryant Gumbel to do a morning show: What an
original idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel's morning competition includes Couric and Lauer at
``Today'' and Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson at ABC's ``Good
Morning America.'' The amount of star power deployed in the morning
underscores the growth and profitability of a time period that used
to be relegated, in Gumbel's words, to ``a rehash of the evening
news. Now, people view what happens in the morning as much more
cutting edge than the evening newscasts.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the heavy hitters at Tuesday's news conference
underscored CBS's high hopes for Gumbel. His presence is sorely
needed at a network whose morning show has been stalled in third
place since 1975. CBS Television president Leslie Moonves called
Gumbel and Friedman ``the cornerstone of a plan to make CBS fully
competitive in the morning,'' which he noted is one of the few time
periods where viewership is growing. Heyward, though he declined to
say how much CBS spent on the new studio, said the network has made
``the most significant investment by far that CBS has ever made in
this time period.''

VENTURING FROM VICTORIAN TO A MODERN MODE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLASGOW, Scotland _ This city has never been known for its
devotion to contemporary architecture. Despite the recent incursion
of Sir Norman Foster's bold exhibition center, which opened last
year and which is known as ``the armadillo,'' the city has mostly
been a place where planners appreciate an old Victorian building
and where Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the great innovator of the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, is still revered.
</P>
<P>
   But Glasgow, which was named the United Kingdom's City of
Architecture and Design for 1999, is looking to the future. Through
the end of the year, it is devoting itself to architecture and
design through a program called Glasgow 1999, a dizzying array of
more than 300 exhibits, building projects, competitions,
conferences, educational programs and special events.
</P>
<P>
   The $62.7 million program, though wide ranging, is placing
particular emphasis on the way architecture and design affect
everyday life. The highlight will be the opening in late June of
the Lighthouse, an architecture, design and urban-planning center
meant to make Glasgow an architectural magnet for the world.
</P>
<P>
   The city has long been proud of its tradition of taking old,
abandoned buildings in the center of town _ like the stately banks
that flourished from tobacco, shipbuilding and ironworks money in
the 18th and 19th centuries _ and finding ways to convert them into
stores, restaurants, apartments and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In the same spirit, the $19.6 million Lighthouse is to be the
new incarnation of the old Glasgow Herald building, Mackintosh's
first major building. Having stood abandoned since The Herald moved
out in the 1980s, the building is being reconstructed by the
Glasgow architects Page &AMP; Park.
</P>
<P>
   When complete, it will be Europe's largest center for design and
architecture, said Sarah Gaventa, a spokeswoman for Glasgow 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction incorporates a startling mix of old and new,
including a tower rising up one side of the old building from which
its new name derives. While preserving Mackintosh's original red
sandstone facade, the architects have built an extension that they
describe as ``a battery pack'' in glass and copper.
</P>
<P>
   About half the size of the original building, the extension
creates a new entrance and houses things like escalators and
elevators. A glass and copper platform, soaring above the building,
will provide spectacular views of the city, while the Lighthouse's
cool, white, contemporary interior is designed to be versatile for
myriad purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Among other features, the Lighthouse will have an interactive
center on Mackintosh's life and work, five areas for permanent and
temporary exhibits, a 100-seat conference room, a cafe and a number
of study centers. ``It's about raising aspirations, about making
people better able to understand why design is relevant,'' Ms.
Gaventa said.
</P>
<P>
   In being selected the year's architecture city, Glasgow beat out
its archrival, Edinburgh, because of Glasgow's ``people-based''
approach to design, Ms. Gaventa said. ``There's a lot of civic
pride here _ people love their city _ and the judges felt that
Glasgow wasn't about grand structures and elitism,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The competition, sponsored by the British Arts Council, provides
the winner a small amount of money and a large amount of favorable
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Glasgow is helping to develop a variety of local projects. For
example, it is providing $825,000 to community groups to build
playgrounds in schools and therapy centers at AIDS clinics. It is
also spending $4.1 million in a collaborative effort with artists
and architects to transform five derelict spots around the city
into playgrounds, gardens and other working public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   And this summer, Glasgow plans to open Homes for the Future, a
$16.5 million project in which seven architects and five developers
have joined to create 100 innovative apartments and town houses on
an abandoned site in a once grand section of Charlotte Street.
</P>
<P>
   The project is made up of a number of mini-apartment buildings,
each reflecting the individual taste and vision of the architect.
One slender, five-story tower, designed by the Ushida Findlay
Partnership, is gently curved to evoke Glasgow's shipbuilding
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a pair of buildings known as
``Introvert/Extrovert Houses''; designed by the firm RMJM Scotland,
the buildings each have one side of glass and light and another
almost without windows. The project's acre-and-a-half site has been
home to many things, including an infirmary and a factory, but has
long been derelict, gaining the sort of stigma that usually drives
developers away.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that Homes for the Future will help lure back
Glaswegians who have abandoned the inner city for the suburbs.
``It's about restarting city living, showing a positive approach to
the city center as a place to live,'' said David McAllister, the
principal architect for the firm ROCK DCM, which planned and is
managing the project.
</P>
<P>
   The homes, McAllister said, are not just ``dinky houses'' but
apartments and town houses of various sizes that have been designed
by cutting-edge firms taking new approaches to heating, lighting
and the use of interior space; as such they are meant to be
prototypes, he said. The first tenants are expected to move in this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The homes are priced from $74,000 to $223,000, and some are
available through Glasgow's liberal subsidized-housing program or
as rental properties. A second phase, of 200 more homes, is to be
completed by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Glasgow 99 also includes a parade of special exhibits. For the
last few months, the Old Fruitmarket in the center of town has been
the site of a challenging exhibition called ``Vertigo: The Strange
New World of the Contemporary City.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the critic Rowan Moore and designed by the
architectural firm of Caruso St. John, ``Vertigo'' is meant to
provoke as much as to teach, using architectural drawings and
models, videotaped interviews and other audiovisual means to
explore the use of space and the myriad purposes of urban projects,
including Richard Rogers' Millennium Dome in Greenwich, England;
Kazuyo Sejima's high-density public housing project in the suburbs
of Gifu, Japan, and the new World Financial Center in Shanghai. The
exhibit closes on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Among dozens of other exhibits are ``Home,'' which examines the
way people live and how home design has been transformed in the
20th century (it runs on the Glasgow Green from June 14 to Oct.
31), and ``Mies Van Der Rohe: Architecture and Design in Stuttgart,
Barcelona and Brno,'' which runs at the Burrell Collection from May
14 to Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of Mackintosh looms large, of course, not least
because of the resurrection of his prized Herald building. But one
Glasgow 1999 goal is to show that he wasn't the town's only
architect in earlier times. So recognition is also being given to
Alexander (Greek) Thomson, Glasgow's great mid-Victorian architect,
who preceded but has long been overshadowed by Mackintosh.
</P>
<P>
   One of Thomson's most important buildings, Holmwood House, an
ornate villa he designed for a wealthy Glaswegian family, is open
to the public after a two-year restoration by the National Trust
for Scotland. Now, on the house's handsomely decorated walls,
visitors can see the nymphets and classical semi-nude figures that
nuns had painted over when they ran a Roman Catholic School there
in the 1950s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Thomson, whose buildings reflected Greek,
Persian, Hindu and Egyptian influences and whose work has often
been compared with that of Frank Lloyd Wright, is to have his first
major exhibition, ``Alexander Thomson: The Unknown Genius,'' at the
Lighthouse, from June 11 to Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Deyan Sudjic, who is directing the yearlong program, said he
hoped that Glasgow 1999 would leave more than a physical mark on
the city. ``Even more important is the climate of ideas which will
survive,'' he said. ``The year is trying to say: `Look at design
differently. It's not something other, something alien.'''

PURGE IN KOSOVO SLOWED, NOT STOPPED, NATO GENERAL REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of President Clinton's arrival at NATO
headquarters in Belgium, the alliance's top general reported
Tuesday that NATO's 42-day aerial assault against Serb forces has
failed to halt the brutal purge of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress growing increasingly restless over the US role in
the NATO mission, German General Klaus Naumann, the head of NATO's
military arm, said the allied siege has slowed but ``cannot stop''
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic's mass deportation campaign appears
achievable,'' Naumann said at a news conference at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment came as a prominent Republican senator questioned
Clinton's courage and political will in handling the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States is prepared to lose a war
rather than do the hard work, the politically risky work, of
fighting it as the leader of the greatest nation on earth should
fight when our interests and our values are imperiled,'' Senator
John McCain of Arizona said in the harshest attack yet on the
Senate floor against Clinton's handling of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, the Senate voted 78-22 to shelve McCain's
resolution calling on Clinton to use ``all necessary force'' to
defeat Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Senator John F. Kerry are among a group of Vietnam
veterans in the Senate who have argued that the United States
should enter a military conflict only if the political leaders
intend to use every necessary means to win. ``I wanted this
resolution considered in now-forlorn hope that the president would
take courage from it, find the resolve to do his duty,'' said
McCain, a presidential candidate and former Navy pilot who spent
more than seven years in a North Vietnam prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, before departing the White House for his 48-hour trip
to Europe, warned against viewing the Kosovo crisis with
``indifference or impatience.'' His call for patience was seen as a
response to McCain and others, including Kerry, who have rebuked
him for failing to prepare for a possible ground war against
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The president, citing his meeting on Monday with Russian envoy
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, said he is prepared to ``seize every
diplomatic possibility'' to end the conflict, but only on the
condition that Milosevic accepts NATO's key demands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton left open the prospect of an agreement that could
save face for Milosevic and his Serb forces. ``This is not a defeat
for Serbia we are seeking,'' he said. ``What we are seeking is the
simple right of Kosovar Albanians to live in peace on their own
land without fear of cleansing because of their religious or ethnic
background.''
</P>
<P>
   There were these other developments as the sixth week of NATO
bombing neared an end:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ethnic Albanians continued to flee marauding Serb forces in
Kosovo by the thousands, pouring through border stations with new
reports of murder and extortion by Milosevic's troops. An estimated
6,000 refugees crossed into Albania, while more than 11,600 reached
critically overcrowded camps in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees told similar stories of Serb soldiers
demanding money from fleeing ethnic Albanians and shooting those
who did not comply. In one episode, Serb troops murdered about 100
civilians and dumped them in a mass grave, according to the Kosovo
Liberation Army's news agency. The reports could not be
independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   To date, nearly 680,000 Kosovar Albanians have been driven from
Kosovo, while an estimated 750,000 remain homeless within the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   _ The exodus continued despite another 24 days of NATO
bombardment, as allied warplanes hit targets throughout Kosovo and
Serbia. Amid the assault, a US Air Force F-16 shot down a Yugoslav
MiG-29 fighter jet in a dogfight, the first downing of Yugoslav
aircraft since two MiG-29s went down on the second day of the NATO
operation. The Russian-made MiG-29s are Yugoslavia's best fighter
jets.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also said its planes Tuesday bombed a MiG-29 parked at an
airfield, leaving Milosevic with only four of his original 15
MiG-29s. The others also were destroyed on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon, responding to reports by the Serbian news media,
said one of the three Army soldiers who were released from a
Yugoslav prison on Sunday left his captors a note thanking them for
treating him with ``dignity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sergeant Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.,
signed the note and added in quotations, ``Slobodan,'' the Pentagon
acknowledged. In addition to being the Yugoslav president's first
name, ``slobodan'' means ``free'' in Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   The state-controlled Serbian news media translated the note as
saying: ``I have much liking for Serbian people after this and I
will continue to pray to God for (peace sign) and an end to this
war. Thank you mostly for the cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon declined to release a copy of the note. But the
Army released a statement that said, ``The note in no way reflects
a lack of support for his mission or NATO policy. This note in no
way lessens the US Army Europe's and 1st Infantry Division's
respect and admiration for Staff Sgt. Stone's personal conduct
during his trying ordeal.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The day after Clinton indicated he might support a pause in
the NATO bombing to seek a diplomatic resolution, Bob Dole, his
Republican rival in the 1996 presidential race, urged him not to
end the conflict short of a NATO victory. Dole had helped the
ethnic Albanians develop a peace plan that six countries endorsed
before Milosevic ultimately rejected it, triggering the NATO
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reaffirmed his commitment to achieving NATO's demands
for peace before he left for Europe, where he also will visit US
pilots in Germany and some of the Kosovar Albanians who were
relocated to Germany after fleeing their homeland. The president
also plans to meet the three freed US POWs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin said a major sticking point in resolving
the military conflict is the type of peacekeeping force that will
patrol Kosovo. ``Whether it would be paramilitary, military or
civil forces, of course, is subject to negotiations,'' Chernomyrdin
said after he met at the United Nations with Secretary General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Engaged in nearly non-stop shuttle diplomacy, Chernomyrdin met
earlier Tuesday in Washington with Vice President Al Gore and other
senior administration officials.

LEGISLATIVE PANEL MAY VOTE ON COMPROMISE PARENTAL NOTIFICATION
BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A key sponsor in the Texas House of a bill that
would require parents to be notified when their teens seek
abortions said Tuesday a compromise bill appears heading for a vote
of an influential legislative committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dianne Delisi, R-Temple, expressed hope for a compromise
parental notification bill drafted by Rep. Steve Wolens, D-Dallas,
chairman of the House State Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who formed a committee this spring to
explore a 2000 presidential bid, has promised social conservatives
in his party he would push for passage of a parental involvement
measure this year.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago a similar measure sat in Wolens' committee so long
that anti-abortion activists accused the lawmaker of intentionally
undermining its chances. It died on the House floor on a
technicality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Wolens has written a good bill,'' Delisi said of the
substitute legislation expected to face a committee vote Wednesday
or Thursday. She described a ``team approach'' to the new bill,
forged between Wolens and Republican lawmakers. Others said
anti-abortion activists played a large role as well, and abortion
rights supporters said they were kept informed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's language that has a lot of support,'' Delisi said, noting
some still have reservations. ``There may be a nip here or a tuck
there that needs to be done to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolens' bill, like one that passed the Senate in March, says at
least one parent must be told when daughters 17 and under seek
abortions. None of the measures under serious consideration this
session would require parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   Compromises in the works include waiving a two-day waiting
period for pregnant teens who arrive for abortions along with a
parent who agrees to the procedure, Delisi confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   In return, anti-abortion activists made certain that only a
judge can act in the parent's behalf if a young woman is deemed
mature and fears physical and emotional reprisals at home.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Wolens bill would explicitly give girls the
right to choose a counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist, member of
the clergy and others to advocate in their behalf before a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights supporters say the change might ease the trauma
of young women in crisis, but a leading player on the anti-abortion
side dismissed it as trivial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it's a token,'' said Bill Price, president of Texans
United for Life. ``The judge could have allowed that anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolens was unavailable for comment Tuesday afternoon, his office
said, because he had flown to Dallas to celebrate his young
daughter's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, negotiations as the bill underwent changes took
several tense turns, those familiar with the process said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we are not interfering,'' said Kae McLaughlin,
director of Texas Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
``Our friends know what's at stake here and are simply not willing
to negotiate young women's lives without giving them some
flexibility. They are working for any softening.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said his group still has problems with three sticking
points in the Wolens substitute. He questioned whether the bill's
definition of abortion is a ``landmine to make the bill
unconstitutional'' and said his side didn't like conceding on the
waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   Price also questioned whether criminal sanctions for doctors
violating the law could stick under Wolens' version.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said her side really wished it could have prevented
young pregnant women having to face judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor action is going to be really compelling on this,''
she said of what her opponents say might be a ``bloody'' battle.
``What we need is a deal that's solid enough that everyone agrees
on.''

FARMING COMMUNITY OF BRIDGE CREEK AMONG HARDEST HIT BY TORNADO
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Subs for budgeted story TORNADO-CHICKASHA) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEANNA BOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ A 6-year-old boy walked aimlessly along a
road in the Southern Hills subdivision amid twisted mobile homes,
crumpled cars and appliances scattered randomly amid the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   When a massive tornado struck the community Monday evening, he
and his mother were running to what they believed would be the
safety of a nearby creek, the boy told officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he saw the wind pick her up and take her off,'' said
Bob Paul, a deputy with the Grady County sheriff's office. ``When
they found him he was wandering the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Added deputy Dick McCoy: ``He was looking for his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers and the National Guard continued to
look Tuesday afternoon for the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Guard scoured the south side of Bridge Creek,
the 30-member volunteer firefighter department headed the search
teams in northern Bridge Creek. By afternoon, the search had
revealed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the Bridge Creek community, specifically the
Southern Hills addition, was among the hardest hit in Monday's
deadly tornadoes that ravaged Oklahoma and Kansas. Officials said
11 people were killed in the farming community of 6,000 about 30
miles southwest of Oklahoma City, most of them in Southern Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Lindsey was among the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   As the mile-wide tornado headed toward her mobile home, she had
four screaming children at her side and a pickup in her back
driveway that wouldn't run. Lindsey, who was celebrating her 31st
birthday on Monday, grabbed bedding and sofa cushions and ushered
the family into the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, the walls were gone and only a kitchen
island and a few pieces of furniture remained of her home. Lindsey
and her four children, age 11 months to 9 years, crouched in the
rubble unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we lived through it,'' an almost cheerful Lindsey said
Tuesday as she and her husband James picked through the debris that
had once been their home. ``What better birthday than that? Happy
Birthday to me. Best present I ever got.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her neighbors weren't so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Grady County sheriff's officials tailing the huge tornado
arrived in Southern Hills to find bodies mingled with twisted
debris scattered across the hilly landscape. Among the dead were an
elderly woman and a 2-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Palmore, a volunteer firefighter, said his first discovery
was a family huddled together, the grandmother dying and a
3-week-old baby missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a body about 300 feet away in the trees,'' Palmore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar wrenching scenes would be repeated throughout the night,
he said, but the memories he clung to were of finding people alive.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to take ambulances into the rural area, rescuers used
pickup trucks to load the injured, and later the dead. The Bridge
Creek school's gymnasium was transformed into a triage area; the
school cafeteria was a temporary morgue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that were alive, they were just covered with mud.
You just had to look and then suddenly you'd see a pink tongue or
white eyes,'' Palmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of the Lord in my heart,'' he added. ``The Lord
was around here (Monday) night. I think he saved my family and a
bunch of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady County sheriff's deputy Al Hooper said he believed
meteorologists' warnings to residents about the tornado spared many
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have that certain amount of people that say, `Oh,
it's not going to get me. It's not going to hit,''' Hooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it did.''

GORE PUSHES MASS TRANSIT IN AUTOMOBILE COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also AUTO-SALES) 
(mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Pursuing the suburban voters who may prove crucial in
next year's presidential elections, as well as traditional
Democratic constituents in cities, Vice President Al Gore called in
a speech here Tuesday for reviving urban centers and reducing
traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the heart of the nation's auto industry, Gore called
not only for better schools and the redevelopment of abandoned
industrial sites, but also for shifting spending from highway
construction to mass transit systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to build subways instead of highways, you ought to
be able to make that choice,'' he told nearly 3,000 local
politicians and community advocates from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments provoked scowls and whispers among the handful
of auto executives in the audience, not one of whom was willing
afterward to criticize the Clinton administration. With nearly 5
million people, Detroit is the nation's largest metropolitan area
without a subway.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the executives' skepticism, Gore replied, ``That's
not universally the case; they know that mass transit has a
legitimate and larger role to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Spending on mass transit has barely kept pace with inflation in
the Clinton administration, rising to $5.39 billion this fiscal
year from $4.58 billion in the 1994 fiscal year, the first for
which the administration set the budget. By comparison, federal
highway appropriations have soared to $27.37 billion now from
$18.99 billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater blamed Republicans for
the disparity, saying that the administration had sought higher
mass transit spending only to see Congress devote more money to
highway construction instead.
</P>
<P>
   But even though many Republicans have been hostile to mass
transit programs, which tend to benefit big, heavily Democratic
cities, the federal budget is the result of a series of compromises
between Congress and the administration, and both sides share
responsibility for the final spending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, Slater and a bevy of other senior federal
officials spoke on Monday and Tuesday at an administration
conference here on ways to improve the quality of life in
communities and protect the environment while still encouraging
economic growth. The Town Hall Meeting for a Sustainable America
was transmitted through satellite video links to 60,000 local
advocates and officials at more than 100 sites around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to critics who have suggested that issues like
traffic congestion and suburban sprawl are not big enough to
justify so much attention from a vice president and presidential
candidate, Gore said, ``I think it's good that people tune in to
the fact that this is a huge issue for Americans who live in the
suburbs, and at long last they're shedding this misconception that
it's somehow a small issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore met with top auto executives Tuesday afternoon as part of
an effort to persuade them to work with the government on ways to
improve the fuel efficiency of sport utility vehicles. The big,
off-road vehicles account for a fifth of all family vehicle sales.
They are allowed a much lower federal fuel-economy standard than
cars, a legacy of the days when sport utilities and other
pickup-truck-based vehicles were used mainly by small businesses.

FARMING COMMUNITY OF BRIDGE CREEK AMONG HARDEST HIT BY TORNADO
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Subs for budgeted story TORNADO-CHICKASHA) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEANNA BOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ A 6-year-old boy walked aimlessly along a
road in the Southern Hills subdivision amid twisted mobile homes,
crumpled cars and appliances scattered randomly amid the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   When a massive tornado struck the community Monday evening, he
and his mother were running to what they believed would be the
safety of a nearby creek, the boy told officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he saw the wind pick her up and take her off,'' said
Bob Paul, a deputy with the Grady County sheriff's office. ``When
they found him he was wandering the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Added deputy Dick McCoy: ``He was looking for his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers and the National Guard continued to
look Tuesday afternoon for the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Guard scoured the south side of Bridge Creek,
the 30-member volunteer firefighter department headed the search
teams in northern Bridge Creek. By afternoon, the search had
revealed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the Bridge Creek community, specifically the
Southern Hills addition, was among the hardest hit in Monday's
deadly tornadoes that ravaged Oklahoma and Kansas. Officials said
11 people were killed in the farming community of 6,000 about 30
miles southwest of Oklahoma City, most of them in Southern Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Lindsey was among the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   As the mile-wide tornado headed toward her mobile home, she had
four screaming children at her side and a pickup in her back
driveway that wouldn't run. Lindsey, who was celebrating her 31st
birthday on Monday, grabbed bedding and sofa cushions and ushered
the family into the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, the walls were gone and only a kitchen
island and a few pieces of furniture remained of her home. Lindsey
and her four children, age 11 months to 9 years, crouched in the
rubble unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we lived through it,'' an almost cheerful Lindsey said
Tuesday as she and her husband James picked through the debris that
had once been their home. ``What better birthday than that? Happy
Birthday to me. Best present I ever got.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her neighbors weren't so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Grady County sheriff's officials tailing the huge tornado
arrived in Southern Hills to find bodies mingled with twisted
debris scattered across the hilly landscape. Among the dead were an
elderly woman and a 2-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Palmore, a volunteer firefighter, said his first discovery
was a family huddled together, the grandmother dying and a
3-week-old baby missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found (the baby's) body about 300 feet away in the trees,''
Palmore said.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early hours of June 8, 1924, a 38-year-old British
schoolteacher named George Mallory set forth with Andrew Irvine, a
28-year-old Cambridge student, from their canvas tent pitched
26,800 feet high on the northern slope of Mount Everest. Their
33-pound oxygen tanks, primitive and heavy by space-age standards,
worked well enough. After a spring of terrible conditions, the new
day dawning, Mallory reported through a sherpa, offered ``perfect
weather for the job'' _ a first ascent of the world's highest
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier why he wanted to climb Mount Everest, he had
famously quipped, ``because it is there.''
</P>
<P>
   But on their summit attempt, Mallory and Irvine vanished, last
seen by Noel Odell, a teammate who reported spotting two tiny
``objects'' moving across a distant snowslope before the mist
closed over them.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five years later, last Saturday, five young climbers
retracing the route said they found Mallory's body lying on a
windswept ledge at about 27,000 feet. But their discovery fell
short of resolving the persistent question of whether the two men
were the first to ascend Mount Everest, 29 years before Edmund
Hillary and Tenzing Norgay stood atop its 29,028-foot summit in
June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Sub-zero temperatures and dry air have left the body well
preserved, though details have yet to be released. Eric Simonson,
the leader of the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, announced
only that ``the remains were conclusively identified.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to other reports circulating within the climbing
fraternity, Mallory's leg was broken and his shoulder damaged,
suggesting that a fall must have contributed to his death. He was
tied to a length of climbing rope. Mallory's snow goggles, worn to
protect his eyes from the blinding glare of sunlight on snow, were
reportedly found in his pocket; if so, he might have removed them
once the sun went down. He was identified from the name on his
clothing, one person said, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of Irvine, but the discoverers, who Base Camp
to rest up, promise to return for a more detailed search.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystery of Mallory's and Irvine's disappearance is one of
the greatest unsolved adventure mysteries of the 20th century,''
said Galen Rowell, a photographer and climber who helped lead an
unsuccessful attempt on Mount Everest in 1983 from the Tibetan
side, where Mallory and Irvine launched their bid. ``At least part
of it is solved,'' Rowell said, ``and in a week or so when the
climbers go back up, we may learn more.''
</P>
<P>
   The discoverers, who are American, have expressed their
exhilaration on the expedition's website, Mountain Zone
(www.everest.mountainzone.com.). Conrad Anker, the first climber to
spot the body, reported seeing something ``whiter and whiter'' than
the surrounding rock and snow. When he climbed over to identify the
body, Anker said, ``he seemed to be at peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hahn, another member, said the team had expected to find
Irvine, but did not explain why. ``And so when we realized that it
was George Mallory, we were really blown away by that,'' Hahn told
Mountain Zone. ``We didn't want to disturb him. He'd been lying
there for 75 years, but at the same time, boy, we thought, what
better tribute to the man than to try and find out if he has
summited Mount Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   With wind blasting them at 27,000 feet, they searched for more
clues. Unable to dig a proper grave in the mountain's frozen flank,
the climbers, before descending, covered the body with rocks and
performed a brief memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered him up, and then it was just amazing,'' Hahn said,
``take one step away from there and you're not worried about George
Mallory's life anymore; one step away from him and you're worried
about your own life and falling down the North Face.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Brashears, a filmmaker who climbed to the summit of Mount
Everest four times, called it an outstanding feat for climbers to
mount a deliberate search at such a high altitude and in such
forbidding conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did was absolutely tremendous,'' said Brashears,
whose new book, ``High Exposure,'' chronicles his own attempts to
find Mallory and Irvine on the North Col. But he also said that
Mount Everest has had its dryest season in recent memory,
apparently baring the mountain enough to expose the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they return to that camp, they will be stronger and more
acclimatized,'' Brashears said. ``It will be very interesting to
see what they find in their second search.''
</P>
<P>
   Brashears, said that he could not know how much the climbers
have discovered. But he suggested that where Mallory was found
``could only be the site of an accident,'' because it well lay off
their route and several hundred feet below where an ice axe
believed to belong to Irvine was found in 1933. Based on his
earlier trips, Brashears said Mallory's body probably rested on a
rock terrace slanting much like a roof. ``It's a natural place for
two bodies, or a body, to have stopped its descent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Mallory and Irvine died while ascending
or descending Mount Everest may only be resolved if the metal Kodak
camera they carried is found undamaged, and the film has been
preserved by the cold. Brashears speculated that, because Mallory
was something of a celebrity, he might have had Irvine carry the
camera, to take his picture when they reached the summit.
</P>
<P>
   John Williamson, a former president of the American Alpine Club,
who joined Brashears on his 1987 attempt to find Mallory and
Irvine, said he thinks that the two reached the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they decided not to go for the top, given who they were,
they would have definitely made it down to camp,'' said Williamson,
who is now president of Sterling College in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Rowell, who wrote about Mallory and Irvine in his own book,
``Mountains of the Middle Kingdom,'' sounded unconvinced. But he
said that present-day climbers admire them as pioneers who
attempted Mount Everest ``when mountains were still exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   Brashears, who filmed the summit with a 42-pound camera for the
large-screen IMAX ``Everest,'' agreed that Mallory and Irvine faced
a more daunting challenge than mountaineers today because ``every
step was a step into the unknown of high altitude physiology, of
what's around the next corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Millikan, Mallory's grandson, said Mallory had been
ambivalent about returning to Mount Everest in 1924, because he had
already done two previous expeditions, in 1921 and 1922, and had a
young family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of got talked into going along on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Millikan, a builder and developer in Berkeley, Calif., and a
climber himself, shrugged off speculation over whether his
grandfather made the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would probably agree that it doesn't matter who
gets to the top of things first,'' Millikan said. ``He climbed for
the joy of climbing.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID BARRON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Major League Baseball said Tuesday it will terminate its
regular-season cablecast agreement with ESPN at the end of the 1999
season, and ESPN responded by filing a lawsuit against baseball in
a New York City federal court.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday's developments stem from a dispute that began when ESPN
signed an eight-year, $4.4 billion agreement in January 1998 to
broadcast NFL games on Sunday nights, creating a conflict with its
Sunday night baseball broadcasts. ESPN proposed moving its Sunday
night baseball games in September to ESPN2, but baseball objected
and the games eventually were returned to the control of local
teams.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, MLB president Paul Beeston accused ESPN of
``willful violation'' of its contract, which runs through 2002, and
added, ``We now must move forward and explore other options.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, baseball must deal with ESPN's lawsuit, which seeks
unspecified monetary damages, an injunction to keep the agreement
in force and a judgment granting it permission to move the three
September games _ including the Astros' Sept. 26 game at Milwaukee
_ to ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Glover, ESPN's executive vice president for programming,
said Beeston notified ESPN on April 21 that baseball would
terminate its contract at the end of the season. ESPN, Glover said,
``was left with absolutely no choice but to go to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover said baseball proposed that ESPN settle the dispute by
signing a new, extended deal that, according to some estimates,
would have increased ESPN's rights payments to baseball by $350
million. After ESPN refused, baseball said it would revoke the
deal, and ESPN responded with Tuesday's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes no sense to us, and that is why we are really
disappointed and upset,'' Glover said. ``We have made numerous
proposals that were in the best interests of baseball to settle
this, and baseball's response has consistently been
disproportionate to the issue at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were left with no choice. We have to go to court and say to
the court, `Hey, we would like you to tell baseball that they have
to live up to the agreement they made with us.'''
</P>
<P>
   MLB spokesman Richard Levin would not comment specifically on
Glover's comments about baseball's request for more money but said,
``We would be very happy to live with the contract as it stands,
providing they (ESPN) didn't break it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover said ESPN is allowed under its contract with baseball to
pre-empt up to 10 games a year. Baseball's approval is required, he
said, but it cannot be withheld for ``events of significant viewer
interest.'' For example, the network has sought and received
permission to pre-empt its June 2 baseball broadcast if the Stanley
Cup playoffs are in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have requested and been granted the right to pre-empt for
NASCAR, U.S. Open golf, Senior U.S. Open golf, the College World
Series, World Cup soccer and the NHL playoffs,'' Glover said. ``To
suggest that the NFL is of lesser interest is preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when baseball on ESPN went head-to-head with the NFL on
TNT, baseball's Sunday night average Nielsen was 1.7 to TNT's 9.1
for the NFL. ESPN's first three NFL games last September had an
average 7.3 Nielsen rating, said Glover, adding, ``The NFL
represents the gold standard of viewer interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin disagreed with Glover's description of the ``significant
viewer interest'' clause, adding: ``The clause doesn't say anything
about ratings. We feel our pennant-race games on Sunday nights are
events of significant viewer interest. It doesn't pertain to
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using their logic, if they signed a deal with the WWF (World
Wrestling Federation), does that mean they could bump baseball?''
</P>
<P>
   Glover said ESPN made repeated efforts to reach a settlement
with baseball, even though the network said it had the right to
move the September games from ESPN, which has 76.2 million
subscribers, to ESPN2, which has 64.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The first offer, which was turned down by baseball last year,
was to allow over-the-air carriers in the participating teams'
markets to carry the games in addition to ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Glover said ESPN then suggested the Sunday games, which are
traditionally the lowest-rated of the year, be returned to the
control of the local clubs. In return, he said, ESPN would trade
the Sunday games for ``meaningful'' Tuesday or Friday night
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   That was rejected, as were two other proposed compromises, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing they've come back with is a proposal to charge
us a huge amount of money to renew and extend the deal we had, or
to cut back the deal we had and charge us a lot more money,''
Glover said.
</P>
<P>
   But Beeston said baseball's efforts to settle the dispute ``were
rejected out of hand'' by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's efforts to terminate the ESPN deal led to speculation
owners might be angling to cut a new deal with a different carrier,
such as Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to comment on the prospect of programming
that may or may not be available in the future,'' a Fox Sports Net
spokesman said. &QL;

MONDAY NIGHT'S STORM HIT IN WORST PLACE AT WORST TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAN JARVIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The devastating storm that struck Oklahoma City Monday night hit
in the worst place at the worst time: a heavily populated area
during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   But trained weather spotters and forecasters using sophisticated
storm-prediction equipment may have kept the death toll down by
giving tornado-leery residents enough time flee, experts said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the damage in Oklahoma City it looks like the
warning system did work well for the death toll to be so low, when
you see the amount of catastrophic damage there was,'' said Dave
Imy of the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla., which issues
severe weather alerts to more than 100 National Weather Service
offices.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment used in Oklahoma, called a warning decision
support system, played a large part in getting accurate information
out, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses artificial intelligence and Doppler radar
image-processing to automatically provide information about where
the tornado was, plus or minus two miles, said Mike Eilts,
assistant director of the National Severe Storms Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows where it was 10 minute ago, 15 minutes ago and where
it will be in the next 15 minutes,'' Eilts said. ``It shows where
it has been and where it's going to go in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   With a tornado watch issued by the weather service at 4:40 p.m.
for central and southwest Oklahoma, people were being alerted well
in advance of the storm moving into Oklahoma City, Imy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sirens were sounded, it was all over the media, you could see
off in the distance that the tornado was coming,'' he said. ``There
was plenty of advance watch and warning that resulted in the
possibility of a significant savings of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a 20-hour period, the weather service issued 174 warnings
covering dozens of Oklahoma counties. Oklahoma City television
stations went live as soon as the twisters formed and, using
helicopters, ground spotters and radar, followed the storm across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma Weather Center, a confederation of federal, state
and University of Oklahoma organizations, is recognized for its
collective expertise in severe weather research. It is in Oklahoma
because the area is known as Tornado Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma also has the Mesonet, a system of weather monitors in
every county that provides detailed real-time readings, said Gary
Sickler, a Texas A&AMP;M meteorology professor who wants Texas to have
the same system with sites in every county.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mesonet is wonderful,'' he said. ``But with a tornado like the
one in Oklahoma there is no place to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the most sophisticated technology the local national
weather offices depend on trained storm spotters to relay and
report severe weather and forecasters who can analyze information,
Imy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is important but it comes down to a forecaster
being able to diagnose the atmosphere and the knowledge to
determine when a storm is becoming severe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the best warning system in the world was in operation,
the storm's timing could not have been worse, experts said. The
tornado hit a populated area during the end of rush hour and stayed
30 minutes to an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings gave residents 20 to 25 minutes of lead time, but
there were still fatalities because the tornado was extreme and it
went over a highly populated area, Eilts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen 30 to 40 tornadoes over my lifetime and this was
definitely the strongest,'' he said. ``This was a very intense
tornado that tracked over the worst possible place.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an area where people grow up practicing tornado drills
and are well prepared for such emergencies. Even though they
responded to the warnings, the storm was so powerful that there was
no good place to hide, Imy said. It appears this was an F4 (on the
Fujita Scale) or stronger, with winds above 200 mph, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people were in a safe place,'' he said. ``If it
had been a weaker tornado their houses would not have been
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though forecasters were tracking the storm from early in
the day, it was difficult to predict that the tornado would become
so strong and head over a heavily populated area, said
meteorologist Daphne Zaras of the National Severe Storm Laboratory
in Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there was a good probability for tornadoes but nobody
expects an event this extreme,'' Zaras said.

EXPERTS PUZZLED AS TO WHY SO MANY TWISTERS HIT OKLAHOMA, KANSAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Also see: Tornado-deaths, Tornado-scene, Tornado-witnesses
and Tornado-Kansas) 
 
By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The devastation inflicted by the tornadoes that slammed Oklahoma
and Kansas was the product of textbook weather conditions and
unlucky geography, say meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts say it is still a mystery as to what caused so
many tornadoes and why a few of them were of such width and
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Monday's conditions made everyone confident
tornadoes were coming,'' said Joshua Wurman, a University of
Oklahoma professor of meteorology and storm researcher. ``But there
was also no great reason to think it would be as bad as things
turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wurman emphasized that was partly because many of Monday's
tornadoes hit heavily populated areas. Saying it was fortunate the
death toll wasn't even higher, Wurman noted similarly powerful
tornadoes form fairly often but don't inflict so much damage
because they travel in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   At least 43 people were reported dead in Monday's twisters.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said they only have preliminary data about
Monday's tornado activity, but say it appears to be either an F-4
or F-5 on the Fujita scale. The activity also appears to have
covered 100 times more ground than most strong tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions that made Oklahoma and Kansas so ripe for
Monday's tornadoes are the exact ones that have made the area known
as Tornado Alley. Starting in the Texas Panhandle and extending
into Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and a few other states,
that section of the country is more conducive to tornadoes than
anywhere in the world, according to local meteorologists. It is
busiest from May to June during the warmest part of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions involve strong, moist, southeasterly winds
blowing in at a low altitude from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry,
westerly winds coming in from the Rocky Mountains at an altitude of
10,000 to 20,000 feet. Such were the conditions Monday in Oklahoma
and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   When the southeasterly and westerly winds meet, the moist air
below and the dry air above create an instability that kick-starts
the storm. Meanwhile, the moisture provides the energy that drives
vertical winds inside the tornado; and the westerly wind gives it
its rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The high winds in a tornado are due to an extreme low pressure
that forms at the center of the spinning column of air. Air
converging toward the low pressure speeds up faster and faster as
it gets closer to the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analogy is the ice skater bringing in his or her arms to
make them faster,'' says Arthur Few, a Rice University professor of
space physics and environmental science. ``He or she starts with a
large, slow rotation and brings it in to become faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the conditions caused the National Weather Service to
issue high-risk forecasts Monday afternoon, Wurman said he
nevertheless didn't think the tornado activity would be so bad
because ``ideal conditions rarely stay ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wurman also noted that a thick deck of cirrus clouds blocking
the sun Monday suggested it might not warm upper winds enough for
such strong tornado activity.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous meteorologists said they look forward to analyzing data
from the tornadoes. Ernst Kiesling, a Texas Tech professor of civil
engineering in Lubbock, said the reported one-mile width of one
tornado is in ``the upper limit of what we're accustomed to
seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wurman said he is still particularly puzzled as to why there
were so many tornadoes. &UR;  &LR; He said his team counted at least two
dozen when they were in the field Monday; other reports put the
total at three dozen.

   GOLD-BATTLE (Washington) _ Deep within a mountain in northern
Washington are microscopic veins of gold worth tens of millions of
dollars. A Texas mining company, Battle Mountain Gold, is so
convinced of the value of that gold that it spent $80 million over
the past seven years winning a variety of permits and legal battles
to extract the ore. But a month ago, the Clinton administration
announced that, under a little-known provision of an 1872 mining
law, the project could not proceed as planned. Now a largely local
dispute has turned into a congressional battle with national
implications.

INITIAL GROUP OF REFUGEES TO ARRIVE IN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first of up to 20,000 refugees from Kosovo to be received in
the United States are scheduled to arrive at 5 p.m. Wednesday at
Fort Dix, N.J. The White House press office said Hilary Rodham
Clinton will welcome them to the country.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 to 400 people, all from camps in Macedonia, will be in
the group. A second group of the same size is due Friday. Two more
groups are scheduled to arrive next week. All the refugees are
expected to remain at Fort Dix, a 31,000-acre military station 17
miles southeast of Trenton, for two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While there, they will be interviewed by immigration officials
and receive physical checkups. Also during that period, they will
be assigned housing, and arrangements for their transportation to
housing sites will be made.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfen of the US Department of Health and Human
Services, which along with the State Department is running the
refugee program as Operation Open Door, said priority is being
given to families with senior citizens or young children _ who are
particularly vulnerable to deteriorating health conditions in the
Macedonian camps _ and only those who volunteer are being
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   He said a full array of of health services, counseling, and
clothing would be made available at Fort Dix.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees will be housed in military barracks, but efforts
will be made to keep families together, said a military
spokeswoman. Dayrooms have been prepared with toys, rockers, dolls,
and games for children.
</P>
<P>
   The fort can accommodate 3,000 refugees at a time. In addition
to those coming to Fort Dix, there will be periodic flights of
persons who have been pre-screened in the Balkans and have sponsors
in the United States to receive them. The first of these is
scheduled to arrive Saturday night at New York's JFK airport, and
will go directly from the airport to their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Regional offices of the United States Catholic Conference are
still organizing housing sites for the refugees who will be
processed at Dix, and numbers to be sheltered in various regions of
the contry have not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Doolin, director of Catholic Charities of Greater Boston,
said very few of the ethnic Albanians being evacuated from the
Balkans are requesting reunification with relatives in the United
States. Only New York surpasses Boston and Worcester in numbers of
residents of Albanian extraction.
</P>
<P>
   Doolin said emphasis is being put on finding appropriate
group-living situations. He said a donor has offered a large bus on
which representatives of Governor Paul Cellucci and Mayor Thomas M.
Menino will travel to New Jersey when the first group is sent to
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge will be helping Muslims, because we don't have
the same (highly developed) network with them'' as with other
communities, Doolin said. ``We are still trying to reach out to the
Muslim community.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that, while media reports have concentrated on
farmers and other rural people who have fled Kosovo, the refugees
include large numbers of lawyers, accountants, and other urban
professionals. Because many of the urban centers of Kosovo have now
been laid waste, a high percentage of these people may remain
outside the disputed Serbian province for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Kharfen said government officials still expect that ``most of
these families will want to return when it is safe, but as legal
residents of the United States, they will be able to stay if they
choose to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Sunday, about 24,500 refugees had been evacuated to
countries outside the Balkans. By far the greatest number to
Germany, which has taken in 9,974. Turkey was second with 3,685.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 countries have offered to shelter refugees
temporarily: 20,000 each in Turkey and the United States, 10,000
each in Germany, Finland and Italy. Virtually every European nation
has offered to take a few thousand, and, in all, temporary shelter
has been pledged for up to 111,445 Kosovars, according to the US
Agency for International Development.

   OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla._ Under clear skies, tens of thousands of
residents across two states began grappling Tuesday with the
aftermath of a series of monster tornadoes that killed at least 43
people, injured more than 500, destroyed more than 1,500 buildings
and left behind mile after mile of twisted metal, denuded trees,
crumpled cars and collapsed buildings. Standing in the anonymous
rubble of their communities, they stared, shook their heads and
joked ruefully, hoping to find some shard of their former lives
that had escaped the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce line of storms roared across Oklahoma and southern
Kansas late Monday, unleashing an unknown number of twisters
including one particularly brutal one that authorities said was at
times as wide as a mile.
</P>
<P>
   That particular tornado _ which officials said would likely be
classified as an F4, or devastating tornado, the second strongest
classification _gouged the southern edge of the Oklahoma City
metropolitan area. It wiped more than 200 homes over eight acres in
the suburb of Moore off their foundations like ice scraped off a
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they expected the death toll to rise.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, officials still could not determine how
widespread the damage was and how extensive the injuries, though at
least 1,500 buildings, both homes and businesses, appeared to have
been damaged or destroyed in Oklahoma on Monday night.At least 200
buildings were hit in southern Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The dead came from all across central Oklahoma, from Oklahoma
City, the suburbs of Moore, Midwest City, Del City and Norman.
Eleven of the dead came from one town, Bridge Creek, about 30 miles
southwest of the capital, near where the largest tornado hit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, five people were killed by a separate tornado that
hit Haysville, Kan., a town of 8,000 south of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   News was still straggling in from damage in small towns and
rural areas across the region while, in Oklahoma City, some 750
National Guard troops helped local officials and rescue dogs make
two, initial searches of the devastated areas around Oklahoma City
on Tuesday in a search for those who might still be trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City Fire Chief Gary Morris said Tuesday afternoon that
no one had been found in the rubble during these forays so
officials were ready to make a third and more substantial search.
``The first two searches we did were very cursory and preliminary
and we're ready to go back in with some heavy equipment and some of
the structures that are most heavily damaged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many were reminded of the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City in April 1995
that left 168 dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like eight or nine Murrah buildings scattered around
the city,'' said Congressman J.C. Watts. ``I've seen everything
from a mother in a hospital not knowing where her two sons are to a
family holding a wicker basket saying this is all we have to start
over with.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared Oklahoma a federal disaster area. A
separate declaration for parts of Kansas was also in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Oklahoma City, in particular, have suffered too
much devastation in recent years and they have been hit very, very
hard by this,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes often stay on the ground for very short periods of
time, sometimes rising into the sky and then dropping down again,
bouncing along the countryside. But the largest of Monday's
twisters, the one that ravaged south of Oklahoma City, was
reportedly on the ground for four hours. Paul G. Knight, another
Penn State meteorologist, said this was ``extraordinary,'' but that
tornadoes which stay on the ground an hour or two probably develop
at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, it goes through Farmer Joe's field,'' he
said, and so the impact is largely unappreciated. Longer-lived
tornadoes than Monday's have happened in the past. The longest, he
said, is believed to have been set by a 1925 twister that was on
the ground for seven hours, wiping out several towns in Missouri,
Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, bulldozers had begun to push into the most
devastated neighborhoods, helicopters moved overhead and the
intermittent sound of chain saws could be heard through the roar of
the wind. In those hardest hit areas, most of the houses had been
stripped of walls and roofing, not a leaf remained on the trees,
many of which were strewn with bits of metal and wood like gruesome
ornaments. At one home, shirts flapped from their hangers in a
closet that had lost its walls, and curtains waved like pennants
through yawning, glassless windows.
</P>
<P>
   Long sheets of metal, apparently roofing material, hung from the
few remaining power lines.Oddly, the lines themselves had not been
pulled down.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were being allowed into many of the hard hit areas,
though those attempting to get inside were asked to show officials
photo identification. A 6:30 p.m. curfew was put into place. In
those areas where the structures appeared most precarious,
residents were still being kept out Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Kathi R. Ferguson, 38, collapsed against her mother as she
looked at the wreckage of her Moore home. ``I spent most of my life
in that house,'' she said through sobs. Ferguson had rushed from
her home in Tulsa to find her parents and see what had become of
the brick house where she had lived for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't collapse, it blew away,'' said Clifford L. Dodson,
73, her father, a retired FAA technician.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dodson's sons-in-law, Brent K. Mackay, 34, tried to clear
rubble from what had been the front door. He lives nearby, but
authorities had not allowed him to go to his home, which was also
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's storm started in southwestern Oklahoma near the town of
Lawton, said Paul Janish, a meteorologist with the National Storm
Prediction Center. The storm rapidly became severe and produced a
string of several, short-lived tornadoes. The storm grew as it
moved northeast at about 30 mph, eventually producing larger
tornadoes as it approached Oklahoma City, Janish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around 7 p.m. the storm intensified into a large super cell
storm and produced a very large, violent tornado,'' he said. The
tornado touched down north of Chickasha, 26 miles northeast of the
capital, and stayed on the ground until it reached Tinker Air Force
Base, just east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The storm system moved across southern Oklahoma City, through
the town of Moore and continued northeast until it wiped out a
factory outlet mall near the town of Stroud, between Oklahoma City
and Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   The storm produced tornadoes for over a 100-mile track, Janish
said. ``It wasn't a continuous tornado, but during the entire path
was producing tornadoes almost continuously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This was all ``very extraordinary,'' Janish said, because
``typically what happens when we get a thunderstorm that produces a
tornado, the tornado will go through its life cycle and weaken in a
short period of time and then the storm may produce another.''
</P>
<P>
   But this particular twister had an unusually long life cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average life span of any given tornado is probably less
than 10 minutes,'' Janish said. ``This tornado not only unusually
large and long lived but unusually destructive in its wind speeds.
It's definitely one of the longer track tornadoes you'll ever
see.''
</P>
<P>
   With an F4 tornado, winds are so strong that houses are leveled,
structures with weak foundations are tossed for some distance, cars
are thrown and large pieces of debris become missiles, Janish said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that even though these tornadoes apparently ranked
among the most powerful of their breed, there was nothing out of
the ordinary about them, meteorologically speaking. ``It's spring,
it's Oklahoma, and tornadoes and even strong tornadoes are not
unusual,'' said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist with the
Pennsylvania State University Weather Communications Group.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes materialize within large thunderstorms, which in this
case were produced by a clash of cold air from the west with warm,
moist air to the east. They often appear on the southern Great
Plains in the spring, in an area of Oklahoma and Kansas nicknamed
Tornado Alley.
</P>
<P>
   What made Monday's disaster unusual, Gadomski said, was that
``by the luck of the draw, the tornadoes went through a relatively
heavily populated neck of the woods.'' The chances that one of the
most powerful class of tornado ``will go over any individual spot
in a person's lifetime is on the order of one in 10 million,'' he
said, ``even in Tornado Alley.''

<P>
   A tornado outbreak in Florida last year led to 42 deaths, while
90 people were killed by tornadoes associated with a 1985 storm in
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Ontario and more than 300 were killed by
what meteorologists call a ``super outbreak'' of some 118 tornadoes
during a two-day storm in April 1974 over 11 midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Marty and Vernoia Bernich survived Monday's storm with their two
daughters at their brick-and-frame home in the Highland Park
neighborhood on the south side of Moore. ``We huddled in a hallway
under a mattress,'' Bernich said. ``We could feel ourselves
elevated, you know, like up to the sky. We could hear things
smashing around us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, Bernich surveyed what was left of his
house. ``There's nothing left,'' he said. An art educator and
potter, Bernich stood amid shards of his work that littered what
was left of his living room while, eerily, several of his other
pots still sat on shelves, inches away, upright and untouched.
</P>
<P>
   He was angry that state officials were not allowing him to bring
more vehicles into the area to cart away more of his damaged goods.
``I just need a little empathy,'' he said to one official, barely
holding back his anger. ``My home has been put in a blender and
we're being treated like Kosovo refugees. Just allow us to take
whatever is left.''
</P>
<P>
   But government officials, worried about a traffic jam in the
debris-clogged streets, were keeping vehicles to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy L. Staggs, 35, a forklift operator, was trying to maneuver
a truck load of recovered household goods from the wreckage of the
three-bedroom home she shared not far from the Berniches with
Michele D. Moore, 34. It was like threading a needle as the truck
squeezed between piles of metal, sheet rock and brick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just moved in two weeks ago,'' said Moore, a machinist in
Norman. ``That's all you can do, just start over. We had just put
in new wallpaper, just settled in, when this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore had been away when Monday's storm him, but Staggs was
there, huddled beneath a mattress in a central hallway with their
two dogs. ``You take for granted that it won't happen to you,''
Staggs said. ``I've never seen anything like this, except for on
TV. We're shook up and bruised up, but we're fine.'' Including the
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In Moore, where the twister cut a three-mile long swath at least
five to six blocks wide through the city, assistant fire chief
Terry Schatt said officials were still assessing the damage though
at least one victim was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pretty much demolished everything along its path through
here and we're still not sure what we're going to find when we
bring in the heavy equipment,'' he said. ``There may be more bodies
or we may have gotten them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakeside Golf Course in Moore, which was renovated last
year, was a wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Joe O'Bryant, 60, the superintendent there, said that he had
been watching television news about the coming storm in his trailer
by the side of the course when he decided to head for a sturdier
building. He got to the clubhouse just in time to see the half-mile
wide tornado cross the highway that abuts the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see trees in it, flying around,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   He ran into the restroom, and felt the walls collapse around
him. He was pinned beneath a crumbled wall, hugging a bar stool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about 45 minutes to dig me out,'' said O'Bryant.
``When I got out I was shocked. I thought that maybe the roof had
collapsed. But the whole building was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The clubhouse was reduced to a pile of loose cinder blocks,
splintered bits of wood, scores of mangled irons and muddy balls
and twisted wrecks of green golf carts piled on top of each other.
The only trace of O'Bryant's trailer was a muddy plot of land where
it had once stood. Bits of the chassis were found 500 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   In the 400-home Highland Park neighborhood, evidence of the
storm's destructive power stretched as far as the eye could see:
block after block of destroyed houses and smashed automobiles;
mounds of splintered lumber and twisted wiring; toppled signs
uprooted from their concrete bases; trees stripped of leaves and
bark.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Bennett, an Assembly of God pastor from a nearby
community, stood at an intersection in Highland Park and offered
counseling to residents leaving the neighborhood. ``We've got a
hundred families in there that are survivors, but they're just not
ready to come out. They want to stay with their homes and see what
they can save,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dazed residents picked through unrecognizable stacks of debris,
searching for familiar objects or valuables. One woman sat on the
steps of her front porch _ almost all that remained of her house _
and hugged a barking German shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks more like a bombing than a storm,'' said Billie Sue
Rhodes, 69, as she plucked a framed photograph from a pile of
wreckage. Rhodes and her husband, Thurman, 73, were at home when
the tornado struck and took refuge together in a closet. It is the
only part of the house still standing. At one point during the
storm, Rhodes had left the closet to retrieve his glasses and the
wind threatened to carry him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't get back inside to the closet and if she
hadn't grabbed me and hung on till the wind laid down, I wouldn't
be here. She's a real hero to me, but I guess she has been for 49
years,'' said Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who said he has suffered three recent strokes, said the
couple had lost everything in the storm and would probably have to
move into an assisted living facility. As he rested against an
overturned television cabinet in what once was his living room,
Rhodes reflected on the results of the last 24 hours: ``Liked to
have kept the house, but the storm took care of that; would have
liked to have kept the car, but I don't really need it. At least
we've still got each other,'' he said.  &QL;

BASEBALL COLUMN: BIRDS HUMILIATED BY CUBANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CUBA-DEFECT, moved in `w' category) 
(bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ At some early-morning hour Tuesday, Brady Anderson
was putting toothpaste on his clubhouse toothbrush and said, ``It
didn't look that good, did it?'' No, he was told. ``I thought that,
too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That succinctly, the Baltimore center fielder offered his candid
assessment of the debacle that had just occurred, a humiliating
12-6 loss to the Cubans that epitomized the Orioles' play one month
into the season.
</P>
<P>
   When they came back to Camden Yards to play the Chicago White
Sox on Tuesday night, Ray Miller was still their manager and Frank
Wren the general manager, but their life expectancy in their jobs
was about as secure as a window washer working on the 82nd floor
without a scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson didn't think team owner Peter Angelos would let the
loss to Cuba influence his thinking, saying Angelos knew his
fervent desire to play the games carried with it no guarantee of
victory. But how long can he tolerate that kind of play from a team
he is paying $78.5 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help anything,'' B.J. Surhoff, the team's veteran
left fielder, said of the display Monday night. ``I don't think it
helps the situation at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I don't care if you spend $200 million if you
don't make good evaluations. Just because you pay a guy a lot of
money doesn't mean you made a great evaluation. You still have to
pick good players and good players have to play well. Right now we
have not played well as a team. I single out nobody but I exclude
nobody either, including myself. Our team has played poorly. We
have not played baseball well enough to win on a consistent level
in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it's only a month, this is the second successive season
that the Orioles are playing poorly, and last year they had the
major leagues' largest payroll. With the team they put together
this season, the Orioles resemble the Yankees of the 1980s, who
were built on money and poor personnel judgments.
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested to Surhoff that the Orioles appeared to be an
ill- conceived team, constructed in a scattershot manner in a
desperate attempt to fill holes created by free- agent defections.
``I don't know if that's a fair assessment,'' he said, ``because I
don't know what went into the process of picking the players they
picked.''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant player was Albert Belle, at $13 million a
year no less. Belle started the season hitting well, but in the 15
games before Tuesday night he had 8 hits in 46 at-bats (.174) and
had driven in only 4 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to put the burden on him,'' Surhoff said, ``but
when he gets hot, hopefully the rest of us go with him. He's a guy
who can carry a team through tough periods. In the meantime the
rest of us have to find a way to pick him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle played lethargically against the Cubans, as if he didn't
want to be there. Actually, none of the players did because they
preferred the day off that Monday otherwise would have been. But
Belle reacted worse than most, not running hard on a grounder on
which he could have been safe because the throw pulled the first
baseman off the base and striking out twice (swinging at none of
the 11 pitches he saw) for a total of four strikeouts in eight
at-bats against Cuba's pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos couldn't be blamed for thinking he deserved more for his
money and that of the 47,940 fans who attended the game. But the
Orioles knew the character of the player when they signed him. All
they wanted was his 50 home runs and 150 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   They still might get them, but they also might not help a team
that was nine and a half games behind the Yankees in the first
month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a way to play better,'' Surhoff said. ``Guys
in this room are capable of playing better. If you look around the
room, everybody's got a track record and most of the guys have very
good track records. You definitely would not anticipate them
playing as poorly as we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles played so poorly against the Cubans that until a
three-hit, three-run flurry in the ninth inning against Norge Vera,
who had held them hitless for seven innings of relief, the Cubans
had outhit them 18 to 3. Seven of the hits were for extra-bases,
not bad for a team that supposedly had no power.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban players clearly relished their dominance over the
Orioles. In the second inning, shortstop Danel Castro slid into
third with the first of his two triples and four hits, instantly
popped up and exhorted the Cuban delegation behind the third- base
dugout to cheer, not that they needed an invitation. In the ninth,
designated hitter Andy Morales slugged a three-run home run and did
a dance of ecstasy as he flew around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The most demonstrative member of the Cuban contingent, though,
was second-base umpire Cesar Valdez, who tackled, body-slammed and
pummeled a protester fan who ran onto the field carrying a small
sign that said, ``Freedom _ strike out against Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff jumped into the fray and pulled Valdez away from the
protester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was just going to hold him for the security
people,'' Surhoff said. ``Next thing you know he was throwing
haymakers. He wanted to go back and hit the guy some more. I tried
not to let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpire explained later that he felt the fan's action was a
lack of respect and believed he handled the situation the way it
should have been handled. Omar Linares, the great Cuban third
baseman, also called it a lack of respect and said, ``The ones who
should worry about this are the organizers, our hosts.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now the Orioles have much more to worry about than the
behavior of some anti-Castro fan.  &QL;

 U.S. QUIETLY iNTENSIFIES ATTACKS ON IRAQ, DESTROYING RADAR SITES  
(Eds.: This story, eliminated earlier, is now restored) 
(bl) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even with Pentagon attention riveted on Yugoslavia,
the United States has quietly stepped up what amounts to a
low-level conflict with Iraq, with almost daily skirmishes that
have resulted in destroying Iraqi radar sites and reports of the
deaths of dozens of Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon accused Iraqi President Saddam Hussein this week of
placing air-defense missiles and radar sites in civilian
neighborhoods. By endangering civilians, the tactic could be seen
as an attempt to hinder U.S. attacks on those sites. The move would
also make it easier for the Iraqis to hide their weapons and have a
clear shot at U.S. warplanes that are patrolling northern and
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration official said they feared that Saddam
might be planning a major confrontation with the United States in
the belief that the U.S. military is stretched thin and distracted
as a result of the Balkan conflict. Reports in the Middle East last
week quoted the Iraqi leader as predicting a ``crucial'' showdown
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strains on U.S. forces, U.S. officials said, the
United States can wage war against both Yugoslavia and Iraq, and
the number of U.S. planes on patrols over Iraq is nearly at full
strength. On Monday, U.S. jet fighters launched missiles against an
air-defense site in a civilian area of northern Iraq, after the
pilots had reported that they had come under fire by surface-to-air
missiles. Iraq said two civilians were killed and 12 were wounded
in the raids near Mosul, 220 miles north of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Other accounts of civilian deaths in Iraq have also circulated.
The Iraqi armed forces reported that a family of seven was killed
Friday 25 miles north of Mosul in a separate attack on nearby
defense sites.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of the casualties could not be independently
confirmed, and Clinton administration officials said any civilian
deaths or injuries were Saddam's responsibility, not the United
States'.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his tactics,'' said Defense Department spokesman
Kenneth Bacon, ``may now be to place his air-defense systems in
civilian neighborhoods, thinking that he can challenge us with
impunity, because he's done that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said that in Monday's attack, U.S. pilots fired two
missiles against air-defense sites in northern Iraq but called off
additional attacks after having determined that at least one radar
installation was in a civilian neighborhood. The missiles were
fired ``in self-defense,'' Bacon said, adding, ``I don't think we
know at this stage what it hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of confrontations began in December, when the
United States and Britain unleashed an intensive four-day aerial
bombardment in response to Iraq's repeated refusal to cooperate
with United Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since, Iraq has fired scores of missiles at U.S.
and British planes and sent up planes to confront them, apparently
hoping to lure allied pilots within range of missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening weeks of the air campaign against Yugoslavia,
Iraqi air-defense forces were unusually quiet. But in late April,
the Iraqis resumed their almost daily provocations of Western
pilots in the no-flight zones, which were imposed in response to
the persecution of minority groups in northern and southern Iraq
after the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern appears to be that he challenges for a while,''
Bacon said. ``We whack him day after day in response to his
challenges, and then he pulls back and goes down for a period and
does nothing. And then he comes back up and presents a new series
of challenges, sometimes with slightly different tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   After the intense raids in December, Clinton gave U.S. pilots
wider authority to retaliate when threatened, allowing them to
strike at any defense system, not just those that actually aimed at
U.S. aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   A result has been the destruction of a large number of
antiaircraft batteries and surface-to-air missile sites throughout
the country. By one intelligence estimate, Iraq has lost nearly 20
percent of its air-defense weapons since December.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have remained defiant. Last week, Vice President
Yassin Ramadan was quoted as saying that he expected the United
States to launch a surprise attack on Iraq and that Washington
would ``pay a dear price if it does so, because Iraq is fully alert
to confront such aggression.'' Later reports in Arab newspapers
said Saddam had sent a letter to his army commanders to notify them
that ``the showdown with the United States is not far away.''

GETRONICS TO BUY WANG GLOBAL IN $2 BILLION DEAL

<P>
   Wang Global, the Massachusetts technology pioneer that has
symbolized the boom and bust of the state's high-tech economy,
agreed to be purchased by a large European firm for about $2
billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Getronics NV of the Netherlands, an information services
company, will acquire Wang, a one-time titan in minicomputers that
reinvented itself as a computer services firm after a plunge into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wang is a major provider of network data services in
North America, Europe and Asia, with expected 1999 revenues of $3.5
billion. Getronics is in the same line of work, but concentrated in
northern Europe. The company sees Wang as a quick way to become a
worldwide power in the business of managing other companies'
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't for sale,'' said Wang chief executive officer Joe
Tucci, who rebuilt the Billerica, Mass. company after it emerged
from bankruptcy in 1993. ``We weren't shopping ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of firms had expressed interest in a deal, said
Tucci.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when other high-tech stocks have been soaring, Wang's
share price has hovered around $20 _ well below the $29.25 offer
from Getronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trading at 20, 21, 22, for the past year,'' said
Tucci. ``And somebody came in and gave us, cash, a 39 percent
premium over where we've been trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang shares Tuesday rose 3 1/8, ending at 28 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci said Wang has no choice but to get bigger. It competes in
a $236 billion-a-year computer services market worldwide against
the largest computer firms _ IBM Corp., Compaq Computer Corp.,
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Electronic Data Services Corp., to name a
few. ``You've got to be big,'' said Tucci. ``Size counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucci had grown Wang from 6,000 workers in 1993 to 20,000 today,
and spent $390 million last year to buy the European computer
services business of Italy's Olivetti SpA, but he knew this
wouldn't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, IBM alone derives about $32 billion in 1998 from
computer services, according to Andrew Efstathiou, senior analyst
at Boston's Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   The deal marks the end of nearly a half century of independence
for the company once known as Wang Laboratories Inc. The company
was founded in 1951 by Chinese immigrant An Wang, who came to the
United States to earn a Ph.D at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Born as a maker of cutting-edge computer gear, the company's
word-processing machines and minicomputers made it a giant during
the 1980s, with employment peaking at 30,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, along with Digital Equipment Corp. and Data General
Corp., came to symbolize the ``Massachusetts Miracle,'' an era of
robust economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But founder Wang's refusal to embrace microcomputers like the
IBM Personal Computer led the firm to disaster and
near-destruction. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1992, marking
a downturn in fortunes that swept up some of Massachusetts other
leading minicomputer makers. An Wang died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   When it emerged from bankruptcy in 1993, Wang was committed to
an entirely new business as a provider of computer services. Last
year's Olivetti deal instantly made Wang a major player in Europe,
generating over half its revenues there. Even so, Richard Brewer,
network services analyst for International Data Corp. in
Framingham, Mass., said that many potential European customers have
avoided Wang, dismissing it as ``a company only known for going
bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has been losing money over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Wang reported a net loss of $57.7 million on revenue of
$789 million for the quarter ending March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci said the new Getronics-Wang company will have instant
market credibility, largely because of its size _ a market
capitalization of about $5 billion. Tucci said that this will make
it much easier for the new company to raise capital in the world's
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci himself will stay on during an open-ended transition
period in the office of the chairman. He expects no job losses
under Wang's new owners. But he does suspect that the famous Wang
name will soon disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that officially yet,'' said Tucci, ``but I'm a
realist. They pay $2 billion, they get to call it what they want.''

   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ I was hiding from Lamar.
</P>
<P>
   An aide for the perpetual presidential candidate was imploring
journalists to come up to his Holiday Inn suite and submit to
``exclusive'' interviews with Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   I crouched behind a door, but the aide found me and begged me to
hear the candidate's revised thoughts on education reform.
</P>
<P>
   I ran away.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Germond, the roly-poly veteran political columnist for The
Baltimore Sun, has a rule that he will not travel more than half an
hour to cover a candidate who is not in the top three. I have a
rule that I won't get in an elevator for a candidate who, after six
years of campaigning full time, is stuck at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only question I had for Alexander, at this first New
Hampshire pageant of GOP losers, was why he had dropped the
exclamation point from his bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   And the only question I had for John Kasich was why he had
appropriated the exclamation point (``Get involved!'') for his
banners.
</P>
<P>
   Can't the Republican Party afford two exclamation points?!
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio congressman is already too bouncy sans punctuation. He
makes Dan Quayle seem mature. On the day Bob Dole resigned from the
Senate, I actually saw Kasich weeping into his Tweetie Bird tie.
</P>
<P>
   The press pack tried to fill the void created by the absence of
W. _ who is still relying on Austin Power _ by mulling the trivial.
We analyzed Steve Forbes' beauty makeover (acid peels  &UR; and &LR;  hair
straightening?). We marveled at the sparrow-like Gary Bauer
comparing himself to the eagle-like Ronald Reagan. We admired the
Howard Beale style of the mad and angry Alan Keyes, who ends his
screeds by stalking off the stage. We pondered the enduring
question about Dan Quayle:  &UR; Why? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, we didn't care about the boys. We wanted the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole got off to her usual Little Miss Perfect start.
When all the candidates lined up for a group photo, she pounced on
her mark with a head-of-her-Harvard-law-school-class smile, leaving
the boys to fumble in her coiffed wake.
</P>
<P>
   We plotted how to trap Liddy into an ad lib. I considered faking
a nosebleed, to see if the former head of the Red Cross really knew
first aid.
</P>
<P>
   We trailed her to a stilted visit with Pembroke High School
students. ``Thank  &UR; ye-e-e-w-w-w, &LR; '' she said. ``Thanks for all your
good input.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, clad in a violet suit, black high heels and big gold
earrings, knew what we were after. She decided to outfox us by
proving she could get loosey-goosey. She added an ``impromptu''
stop at Dairy Queen, where she let fly and ordered a cup of vanilla
ice cream with hot fudge sauce and ``a little whipped cream and
lots of nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   She sat in a booth and stared down at the sundae, teetering at
the precipice of improvisation, perhaps recalling Jackie O's
dictum: Never chew in camera range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all are just waiting for this,'' she smilingly accused the
photographers. ``They can't wait. Here you go. Are  &UR; ye-e-e-e-w &LR; 
ready?''
</P>
<P>
   As she took dainty bites, a reporter asked her position on Dairy
Queen vs. Tastee Freeze. ``Anything sweet,'' replied the woman
whose sweet-talking Washington ways earned her the nickname ``Sugar
Lips.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own controlled way, Mrs. Dole made a bold move at the GOP
dinner in the ``Live Free or Die'' state. She called for stiffer
regulation of guns, observing, ``I don't think you need an AK-47 to
defend your family.'' Incredibly, one man booed her when she urged
gun safety locks to protect children.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Littleton, when other Republicans have taken
cheap shots at Hollywood, Mrs. Dole was the only one in this
mediocre mob who had the courage to stand up to the NRA, saying
special interests should not dictate policy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can be sure when Mrs. Dole's pollster, Linda
DiVall, publicly praised her guts, that the candidate's stand was
also smart politics. She is pitching her ``Let's make history''
candidacy to middle-of-the-road soccer moms who are turned off by
Charlton Heston's assertion that ``we cannot let tragedy lay waste
to the most rare and hard-won human right in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's position may have been calculated, but it was also
correct. And this bite wasn't dainty.  &QL;

WEAKENING TREASURY ISSUES SPARK DROP IN MOST INDEXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Further deterioration in the bond market gave equity
traders an excuse to sell stocks Tuesday, and major market averages
fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
   One day after setting a new high, the Dow Jones industrial
average recorded its sixth point decline in five weeks. Interest
rate-sensitive stocks like American Express, J.P. Morgan and
Citigroup were among the Dow's biggest decliners. By the close, the
blue-chip index was down 128.58, or 1.17 percent, to 10,886.11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indexes also fared poorly.
</P>
<P>
   A big sell-off in popular technology stocks like Microsoft,
Cisco Systems, America Online and EMC helped drag down the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 stock index by 22.63, or 1.7 percent, to 1,332.00. The
NASDAQ's composite index fell even more sharply, dropping 50.46, or
2 percent, to 2,485.12. And the Street.com's Internet stock index
fell 17.84, or 2.8 percent, to 615.13.
</P>
<P>
   Although few sectors of the market managed to post gains
Tuesday, transportation stocks were an exception. For the second
straight session, the Dow Jones transportation average set a new
high.
</P>
<P>
   The overall market's slide Tuesday was attributed not only to
profit-taking after Monday's big advance, but also to recent
developments in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term bond yields have risen to their highest levels in nine
months, reflecting traders' fear of inflation, a result of fresh
evidence of economic buoyancy. The Conference Board reported
Tuesday, for example, that its index of leading economic indicators
rose for the sixth straight month in March, and the government said
that conditions in the housing market remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stock market is right to be worried about rising
interest rates,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at
First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With signs of economic improvement popping up in a number of
countries and industries, fixed-income investments may again become
competitive with stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to these changing conditions, Richard Bernstein,
chief quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., signaled a
shift in his group's model portfolio Tuesday to 40 percent stocks,
30 percent bonds and 30 percent cash, from 40 percent stocks, 50
percent bonds and 10 percent cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started with an equity call, where we think it is time to
start rotating out of large-cap, high quality growth stocks and
move into value and small-cap stocks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our profit indicators in those areas are popping up,
signaling it is time to move. But value stocks tend to rise when
interest rates go up. So we shortened our bond position as well.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Goldman, Sachs, the rise in interest rates
hurt the stocks of financial service companies Tuesday. Goldman,
whose stock was freed to trade for the first time Tuesday, saw its
share price soar 17] to close at 70].
</P>
<P>
   But J.P. Morgan, a competitor and a Dow component, fell 4 1/16,
to 133{. Merrill Lynch shed 6, to 81\. Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette
declined 3 3/16, to 63 15/16. Charles Schwab lost 5 11/16, to 101}.
And Citigroup fell 2}, to 72\.
</P>
<P>
   Big technology stocks also slid broadly. Microsoft fell 1 13/16,
to 78 1/16. Cisco Systems dropped 5, to 108|. Lucent Technologies
declined 1|, to 57~. EMC fell 7, to 100. And America Online lost 6
1/16, to 127 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was active. On the Big Board, 933.2 million shares
changed hands. Volume on the NASDAQ was 921.7 million shares.

MAJOR RECORD LABEL TO DISTRIBUTE MUSIC ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Insisting that it cannot afford to wait for the
recording industry to settle divisions over how to distribute
commercial music online, Universal Music, the largest record
company, said Tuesday that it was investing in technology to sell
and distribute music over the Internet by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement signals a major break in ranks with the
Recording Industry Association of America, the industry group that
has been struggling _ with Universal's participation _ to agree on
a standard for selling recordings as data that arrive on a
customer's computer hard drive, instead of on CDs or cassette
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's sense of urgency is shared by a growing number of
labels.
</P>
<P>
   After long ignoring the Internet, the recording industry now
finds itself rushing to offer consumers an alternative to MP3, a
free technology for delivering music online that is quickly
becoming a de facto standard. The industry hates MP3 because it
does not prevent illegal copying of music and has quickly become a
venue for widespread music piracy online.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary of Seagram's Co., said
it was working with InterTrust Technologies Corp. of Sunnyvale,
Calif., to develop software to securely store, sell and distribute
Universal's music online. Universal said it planned have a pilot
version running by the end of the year and that the success of the
pilot would determine the rollout of the full service.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kenswil, president of Global Electronic Commerce
Universal, whose stable of artists includes Elton John, No Doubt
and Pavarotti, said the company ultimately intended to embrace
whatever standards the music industry settled on for digital
delivery of music. But he said Universal needed to put its
technology in place as soon as possible to have any chance to sell
music online by next Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand is there, and demand is being filled now by
independent labels and illegal content,'' Kenswil said. ``It's
crazy for us to not recognize demand and move.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said Universal Music was the first major
record company to publicly announce plans for digital distribution.
A few smaller independent record labels already are selling music
online, joining a handful of artists, including the rap artists
Public Enemy. Some artists are distributing their music in the MP3
format in defiance of their record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the growing likelihood that the record store of
tomorrow will be the desktop computer or digital listening device,
the recording industry, in concert with the consumer electronics
industry, is struggling to reach a standard for delivering music
digitally. An ad hoc group formed by the industry association,
known as the Secure Digital Music Initiative, has been meeting
twice weekly. SDMI wants to reach a standard by June for portable
devices that play digital music.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo Chiariglione, head of SDMI, said he was not troubled by
Universal's efforts. He said the concept behind SDMI was to create
overarching standards for distributing digital music but to let
companies adopt their own technologies to meet those standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``SDMI is about a framework,'' he said. ``It's not about telling
them how to do a particular thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the organization would meet four more times before
releasing a standard for portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   But while the group meets, MP3's popularity keeps growing. On
Monday, RealNetworks, the leading developer of Internet audio and
video software, released a test version of a program called Real
Jukebox, which enables users to record CDs on their hard drives in
MP3 format. At the same time, Thompson Electronics announced it
would manufacture a portable player for Real Jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hardie, a digital music analyst with Forrester Research, a
New York-based market research firm, said Universal clearly had
decided it could not afford to wait for the industry group to reach
a standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This to me is breaking ranks; they're not waiting for SDMI to
test standards,'' he said. ``It shows that the major record
companies have moved from their original position that everything
via the Internet is bad and pirated to saying this is its time to
begin testing.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Hardie added, the labels were saying ``there's no
point in waiting and studying.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenswil disputed the assertion that his company was breaking
ranks. ``SDMI is something that has to run in parallel'' with
Universal's own efforts, he said, adding that InterTrust
Technologies' software would be ``flexible'' enough to comply with
whatever industry standard emerges.
</P>
<P>
   InterTrust Technologies' underlying technology, DigiBox, is
designed to prevent consumers from making and listening to copies
of music they have not paid for.
</P>
<P>
   The technology does not prevent music from being copied; in
fact, for instance, one user could send a copy of a song or album
via e-mail to another user. However, embedded in the music is a
code that prevents the recipient from playing the recording without
first paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   Universal announced in April that it had teamed up with another
record company, BMG, to create a series of Internet sites to
promote and sell music online. But in that case, the sites will
simply take orders for CDs and cassettes and ship them to the
buyers.

WHEN TWISTERS HIT, INJURIES RUN TO EXTREMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Also see: Tornado-deaths, Tornado-scene, Tornado-witnesses,
Tornado-Kansas and Tornado-weather.) 
 
By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is very little in between when it comes to tornado
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Most victims of a twister are either killed outright or left
with minor cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Tornado casualties are different from what emergency medical
experts normally see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is, when you get there, you expect to be able
to help people,'' said John Sneed, director of Williamson County
Emergency Medical Service which responded when a tornado killed 27
in Jarrell, Texas, on May 27, 1997. ``We only had 11 patients. We
dealt with them quickly. Then you get into the search, rescue and
recovery mode ... and you keep finding fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wichita, Kan., it was a similar story of contrasts at Via
Christi St. Francis Hospital, where 100 victims from nearby
Hayesville were taken for treatment after Monday night's storm.
</P>
<P>
   Trauma director Dr. Steve Smith said he saw cuts and abrasions
on people who had ``bounced around'' inside a trailer, and he
treated people with broken arms, legs and pelvises.
</P>
<P>
   Some people had limbs that had been crushed under debris. One
woman had a ``penetrating chest wound'' caused by a flying object.
An infant who was sucked out of a mobile home died of massive head
injuries shortly after admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the rest had the same kind of injuries people might have
from a skateboarding accident,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado's seemingly fickle pattern of death and destruction
can be attributed to the immense power packed into a relatively
small area, said Jon Zeitler, senior forecaster for the National
Weather Service in League City, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The intense force created by high winds blowing in a tight
spiral destroys everything in its path. But that path is short and
narrow compared to that of a hurricane, Zeitler said.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane's strongest winds may blow several hours; most
tornadoes touch ground only for a few minutes. A hurricane can be
200 to 500 miles wide; a tornado may be only 75 yards to a mile
wide.
</P>
<P>
   That's why one house may be destroyed while another across the
street is left standing, Zeitler said. Similarly, one family may be
wiped out and another left intact.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Coscia, a trauma services director in Austin, Texas,
spent 25 years as a surgeon in Springfield, Mo. _ located in the
so-called Tornado Alley that includes the Texas Panhandle,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and a few others states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that come in make it. The majority will go home, by
far,'' he said. ``The gamut of injuries is from one extreme to
another.''
</P>
<P>
   He said flying objects cause the most damage. Shattered glass
lacerates, other objects cause wounds similar to gunshot wounds or
stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Craig Key, associate medical director of Houston Fire
Department EMS, compares the impact on humans to being close to a
large explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a lot of force,'' he said. ``Our bodies
are relatively frail. When they come in contact with those forces,
there's really no contest.'' &QL;

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ With no consensus on ground troops for
Kosovo and no sign that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
is wavering, allied leaders are beginning to face the prospect of
housing half a million refugees through the bitter Balkan winter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with that forbidding prospect, NATO's top military and
civilian officials continue to assert that the bombing of
Yugoslavia will eventually force Milosevic to concede defeat and
accept a settlement in Kosovo. What they cannot say is when.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making progress,'' Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany,
NATO's senior military officer, said on Tuesday. ``We are nibbling
away night by night and day by day at some of his military
capabilities. Why should we change?''
</P>
<P>
   But the allies are beginning to have doubts that Milosevic will
be brought to heel in time to get the masses of Kosovar refugees
home before subfreezing temperatures return to the Balkans in
October.
</P>
<P>
   With 136,000 Albanians now in camps in Macedonia and 400,000
huddled in tents in Albania, one allied foreign minister, Knut
Vollebaek of Norway, told editors of The New York Times on Tuesday,
``Realistically, we have to be prepared for keeping the refugees in
for at least the start of the winter.'' Vollebaek is also chairman
in office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which would have a role in implementing a settlement in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official also said on Tuesday that Sadaka
Ogata, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, had been
advised to start thinking about making the camps habitable in
winter.
</P>
<P>
   This is contingency planning now, the American said, but it
could become necessary if the bombing fails to convince Milosevic
to give up. The allies have been unable so far to bring themselves
to accept any other strategy to achieve victory, which is probably
the only way refugees outside the country and the 650,000 people
displaced inside Kosovo will ever be able to go back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that military experience so far has suggested that
an air campaign so far in history never won a war, that's true,''
Naumann said on Tuesday at a news conference marking his retirement
after three years as chairman of NATO's military committee, which
advises the alliance's civilian authorities here. ``But we see a
real chance that we can make it, and for that reason I think there
is no necessity at this point in time to change strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance of 19 nations could not decide to invade Kosovo
without a consensus of all of them, he said, ``and that is
something which you can't get on this critical issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a consensus existed, one official said, it would take
until September for the allies to plan and assemble a ground force
to fight its way in, and refugees could not follow for many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some other officials say that it may not take so long, that it
may be possible to get ground troops into Kosovo by August, which
might make it possible to get the refugees back before winter if
the planning and deployment began at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   But so far NATO has given itself no choice but to continue
intensifying the bombing in hopes that it will eventually convince
Milosevic to withdraw the 40,000 Yugoslav soldiers and police
officers from Kosovo and accept an international peacekeeping force
to protect the returning refugees and allow reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing strategy, Naumann said, is based more on political
than military logic and, after months of ultimatums and
negotiations, the allies have lost an advantages that every
military strategist sees as essential: surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Military logic, as most officers understand it, would have
dictated a strategy that led to a clear military end: an imposed
settlement after an invasion and occupation of Kosovo, for example,
or conquest of Yugoslavia and unconditional surrender by Milosevic
from a bunker in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But the allies have never really considered total war against
Yugoslavia, leaving only the hope that continued bombing and
diplomacy will convince Milosevic to accept a settlement rather
than take his country down with him.
</P>
<P>
   The intensified bombing will make life so miserable for
Milosevic and his regime, Naumann said on Tuesday, that eventually
the authorities in Belgrade will see the light. But how long would
that take?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see how they will feel after a few more weeks and
months or what have you of continuously pounding them into
pieces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in comments in Washington after the NATO summit meeting last
month, Naumann acknowledged, ``We may have one flaw in our
thinking, and this flaw may be that we believe that no responsible
man who is at the helm of a country like Yugoslavia can wish to run
the risk that his entire country will be bombed into rubble before
he gives up and complies with the demands of the international
community,''
</P>
<P>
   But he added then that it had been a ``fair assumption'' to
assume that Milosevic would not try to beat unbeatable odds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like Naumann, Gen. Wesley Clark, the allied commander in charge
of the bombing, knows Milosevic well from many previous encounters,
the last of them at the beginning of this year when the two
generals went to Belgrade to warn the Yugoslav leader what lay in
store for him unless he agreed to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think back to my experience with President Milosevic in late
January, and all the subsequent events,'' Clark recalled here last
week. ``I suppose that he may have thought that NATO really
wouldn't launch the air strikes, but he was wrong. He may have
believed they wouldn't last after they were started. Wrong. He may
have thought that some countries would be afraid of his bluster and
intimidation, they would withdraw the use of their bases or buckle
under his intimidation. He was wrong. He thought that other
countries might rush to his aid. Wrong again.''
</P>
<P>
   Running through a litany of the Yugoslav leader's
miscalculations, Clark sounded almost as if he were trying to
convince himself that NATO's political assumptions would finally
turn out to be correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're winning, Milosevic is losing, and he knows it,'' he
said. ``He should face up to this, and he should face up to it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Naumann echoed that view on Tuesday. ``I believe that the air
campaign is properly working, but you should also take into account
that we have conditions which we have to follow which are degrading
to some extent the impact of the air campaign,'' he added, ``most
notably the condition that we have to avoid collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies avoid ``civilian damage'' _ civilian casualties or
damage to civilian property _ because they fear that public opinion
would turn against the war if such damage were extensive.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen thousand bombs and missiles have been dropped so far,
Naumann said, and the fact that by NATO's count only six have gone
astray _ even though some killed scores of civilians _ is a marvel
of modern warfare, he added. Still, ``I regard every single
civilian killed as being one too much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Milosevic's forces are still killing Albanian
civilians in Kosovo. ``Our military intervention can and has slowed
down the instruments President Milosevic uses for ethnic
cleansing,'' the general said. ``We cannot stop such a thing
entirely from the air. But we certainly can succeed in degrading
his capability to conduct operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there can be no doubt that we have got to succeed,
since anything short of that would mean risks for the stability of
Europe.''  &QL;

INITIAL GROUP OF REFUGEES TO ARRIVE IN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first of up to 20,000 refugees from Kosovo to be received in
the United States are scheduled to arrive at 5 p.m. Wednesday at
Fort Dix, N.J. The White House press office said Hilary Rodham
Clinton will welcome them to the country.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 to 400 people, all from camps in Macedonia, will be in
the group. A second group of the same size is due Friday. Two more
groups are scheduled to arrive next week. All the refugees are
expected to remain at Fort Dix, a 31,000-acre military station 17
miles southeast of Trenton, for two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While there, they will be interviewed by immigration officials
and receive physical checkups. Also during that period, they will
be assigned housing, and arrangements for their transportation to
housing sites will be made.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfen of the US Department of Health and Human
Services, which along with the State Department is running the
refugee program as Operation Open Door, said priority is being
given to families with senior citizens or young children _ who are
particularly vulnerable to deteriorating health conditions in the
Macedonian camps _ and only those who volunteer are being
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   He said a full array of of health services, counseling, and
clothing would be made available at Fort Dix.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees will be housed in military barracks, but efforts
will be made to keep families together, said a military
spokeswoman. Dayrooms have been prepared with toys, rockers, dolls,
and games for children.
</P>
<P>
   The fort can accommodate 3,000 refugees at a time. In addition
to those coming to Fort Dix, there will be periodic flights of
persons who have been pre-screened in the Balkans and have sponsors
in the United States to receive them. The first of these is
scheduled to arrive Saturday night at New York's JFK airport, and
will go directly from the airport to their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Regional offices of the United States Catholic Conference are
still organizing housing sites for the refugees who will be
processed at Dix, and numbers to be sheltered in various regions of
the contry have not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Doolin, director of Catholic Charities of Greater Boston,
said very few of the ethnic Albanians being evacuated from the
Balkans are requesting reunification with relatives in the United
States. Only New York surpasses Boston and Worcester in numbers of
residents of Albanian extraction.
</P>
<P>
   Doolin said emphasis is being put on finding appropriate
group-living situations. He said a donor has offered a large bus on
which representatives of Governor Paul Cellucci and Mayor Thomas M.
Menino will travel to New Jersey when the first group is sent to
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge will be helping Muslims, because we don't have
the same (highly developed) network with them'' as with other
communities, Doolin said. ``We are still trying to reach out to the
Muslim community.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that, while media reports have concentrated on
farmers and other rural people who have fled Kosovo, the refugees
include large numbers of lawyers, accountants, and other urban
professionals. Because many of the urban centers of Kosovo have now
been laid waste, a high percentage of these people may remain
outside the disputed Serbian province for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Kharfen said government officials still expect that ``most of
these families will want to return when it is safe, but as legal
residents of the United States, they will be able to stay if they
choose to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Sunday, about 24,500 refugees had been evacuated to
countries outside the Balkans. By far the greatest number to
Germany, which has taken in 9,974. Turkey was second with 3,685.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 countries have offered to shelter refugees
temporarily: 20,000 each in Turkey and the United States, 10,000
each in Germany, Finland and Italy. Virtually every European nation
has offered to take a few thousand, and, in all, temporary shelter
has been pledged for up to 111,445 Kosovars, according to the US
Agency for International Development.

LOTS OF BLAME, NO CONSENSUS AT SENATE HEARING ON SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., openly rued the
estrangement of too many parents from their children's lives. Sen.
Richard Bryan, D-Nev., decried the dearth of adequate counseling in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, lamented the absence of prayer in
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the only time we tolerate prayer in school these
days,'' Hatch said, ``is when people come to on-school memorials in
the wake of tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   The three senators were all speaking at a Senate hearing Tuesday
into the entertainment industry's marketing of violent fantasies to
children.
</P>
<P>
   But their remarks, which strayed well beyond those parameters,
underscored the multitude of directions in which lawmakers are
looking for solutions to the deadly school shootings in Littleton,
Colo., and their lack of consensus about what Congress can and
should do.
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since the 15 deaths at Columbine High School,
Republicans have focused largely on broad cultural realities that
promote, or fail to stem, violence among children. Democrats, too,
have emphasized that an array of factors give rise to such
behavior, but many Democrats have also called for more stringent
gun control measures, which many Republicans oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said Tuesday
that Democrats would try to bring to the floor several modest gun
control proposals when the Senate begins consideration of broad
juvenile justice legislation early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi has indicated a
willingness to allow debate on such measures. But Lott, who has
spoken at conventions of the National Rifle Association, made clear
Tuesday that he is unlikely to support anything beyond minor
tinkering in gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think additional gun control measures are probably not
needed,'' Lott said. Referring to the shootings in Littleton, he
added, ``The press and others may want this to turn into gun
control. That's not what this is about. That may be a small part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing approaching unanimity in either party about gun
control. Just as a number of moderate Republicans have indicated
support for more regulations, a number of Democrats have played
down the importance of gun control, partly reflecting a belief that
their advocacy of the issue was one reason they lost control of the
House in the 1994 elections. The National Rifle Association threw
its efforts into singling out certain Democrats for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But several Democrats have sought to train the spotlight of
Littleton on gun control. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., held an
unofficial hearing of Democrats on the House Government Reform
Committee this week to draw attention to a specific military sniper
rifle, able to shoot targets four miles away, that is easier to
obtain than a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., said that two days after the
shooting, she placed a telephone call to House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., urging him to support a bill she has introduced
that would, among other regulations, require firearms manufacturers
to make weapons more child-resistant and make it harder for young
adults to purchase weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McCarthy said on Monday that she had not heard back from
Hastert. Speaking of Republican leaders, she said, ``They still
don't want to touch this issue with a 10-foot pole.''
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert, said that the speaker
was still reviewing her proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats at Tuesday's Senate hearing
acknowledged that they have limited Constitutional authority to
regulate artistic expression, no matter how violent, in movies,
music and video games.
</P>
<P>
   They may have limited political appetites, too; just as money
from the National Rifle Association lines the pockets of
Republicans, money from the entertainment industry lines the
pockets of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's political action committee donated $1.35 million to
Republican congressional candidates in the 1998 election cycle and
$283,000 to Democratic congressional candidates, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan research group. PACs
and individuals affiliated with the movie and music industries,
meanwhile, poured $4.4 million into Democratic campaigns and
contributed $2.8 million to Republican candidates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many Republicans, along with some Democrats, have exhibited a
legislative hesitancy in the aftermath of Littleton and a
preference, instead, for talk.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and Lott announced the creation of what they called a
nonpartisan National Conference on Youth and Culture that would
bring students, teachers, religious leaders and others together for
periodic discussions around the country.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said Monday that his committee would hold hearings next
week to talk about the causes of juvenile violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would caution everyone, however, that disenchantment among
America's youth defies simple and politically expedient
explanations, nor should we expect a rapid consensus on new
legislation,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, lawmakers have promoted a panoply of measures from
better school counseling to the installation in schools of
sophisticated security gadgetry.
</P>
<P>
   As senators at Tuesday's hearing listened to Charles J. Chaput,
the Roman Catholic archbishop of Denver, talk about the power of
art to shape the soul and questioned Jack Valenti, president of the
Motion Picture Association of America, about Hollywood's bloodier
products, they frequently called for the industry to regulate
itself, essentially trying to shame it into restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said that seven industry executives
had declined to come to the hearing to defend the language and
imagery in their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are words they wouldn't use at their country clubs,''
Brownback said, ``but they'll sell them to our children.''

STUDENTS PREPARING FOR DRAMA CLASS WHEN TORNADO HITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORE, Okla. _ High school senior Crystal Cantrell and about 50
other theater students were in a lecture hall at Westmoore High
School on Monday afternoon, preparing to perform scenes from many
of the plays the class had done in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 younger students, teachers and parents from Moore West
Junior High School, about two miles away, were in the school's
auditorium for an awards presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The radio was on as the theater students donned their costumes.
They listened as a vicious storm cell took aim at Oklahoma City.
Then, as the tornadoes closed in, they abandoned their
preparations, got on the floor between the seats and waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were crying `cause you could hear it coming. It was so
bad. It was so scary,'' Cantrell said. ``It sounded like
explosions, you could hear the roof coming off and falling in.''
</P>
<P>
   A police officer assigned to the school alerted the visiting
middle schoolers that the storm was about to hit, said Carri Smith,
a Westmoore student.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the one who got everybody out'' of the auditorium, Smith
said. ``She's pretty much our little hero.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday students recounted their close call as they waited
with their families to be allowed back into their devastated
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The school is adjacent to the area that officials said sustained
the worst damage from Monday's killer tornadoes _ southwest of
119th Street and Western Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   After the storm passed, they could see part of the school roof
torn off. Lockers were strewn through hallways, ceiling tiles and
insulation were all over the school, students said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, cars in the parking lot were tossed about like toys,
some piled on top of others, Westmoore students said.
</P>
<P>
   Cantrell's mother, Deborah, had been at the school to watch her
daughter perform and had carried the family's Siamese cat, Mesha,
with her. She knew what kind of storm was brewing, she said
Tuesday. Many in the area chose to ride out the storm in their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have no idea what's about to happen,'' she
remembered thinking as she went to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Cantrell went outside the school after the storm passed. She and
friends, and her mother went atop a small hill and looked at a
subdivision across Western Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it looks like is a bombing over there,'' said
Deborah, Cantrell's mother who declined to give her last name.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; MOTHERS WHO THINK: TALES OF REAL-LIFE PARENTHOOD &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Camille Peri and Kate Moses (Villard, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy, the editors point out, to find written accounts
of motherhood ``that haven't had their sharp, thought-provoking
edges sanded off.'' These women have put together a book that is an
antidote to what they call ``the saccharine, oversimplified
literature of motherhood.'' It's a collection of 37 essays from
prominent and new writers, including stories from the ``Mothers Who
Think'' feature of the online magazine ``Salon'' that inspired the
project. Their subjects include anything connected to motherhood,
which means there are no limits. Among the contributors are Cathy
Wilkinson, an Arizona mom who describes how she saved her sons from
an intrusive bull by smacking it with her blender; Susan Straight,
who tells of being suddenly single and in possession of an
87-year-old farmhouse plus ``three kids, a job, a big yard, seven
rabbits and two hands''; Elizabeth Rapoport, whose essay, ``How
Many Working Fathers Does It Take to Screw in a Lightbulb?,'' is
really a quiz _ a Superparent Achievement Test that ``reflects and
quantifies the real psychic energy and time-suck of child
rearing''; Anne Lamott, who discusses anger (she told her son that
when his pets, due to his neglect, began starving to death she
would no longer intercede to keep them alive but would, instead,
have them immediately put to sleep); and Alex Witchell, who
contemplates the perplexities of being a stepmother. This book is a
lot like motherhood itself _ full of joy, trauma, insanity, hard
work, exhaustion and more than a few good laughs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TELLING &QL; 
 &UR; Patricia Weaver Francisco (HarperCollins, $23)
</P>
<P>
   Here is a lesson for those of us who have been lucky. One summer
night in 1981, Francisco awoke to find a stranger in her bedroom.
Her husband was away for a week, her sister had just left.
Francisco lived in a shady old Minneapolis neighborhood where she
felt smugly, naively safe, but still she did not take chances. She
was careful. She locked her doors and windows. And suddenly, there
was a stranger in her room. Rape, she says, is not a word we like
to use _ we fall back on terms like assault or sexual violence
because they are easier for us to say. But Francisco says it, over
and over, with a persuasive eloquence that sets her book apart from
others of its kind. She does not want pity, or even sympathy. She
wants intellect. She wants us to know and think about what happened
to her, and to realize that it happened to us, too _ that the
victim of a rape should not be left alone with a problem she did
not create. She wants us to think about how women are portrayed on
television and in advertising, and she wants us to know what it is
like to have to, as a counselor put it, ``build an extra room onto
your house for the fear.'' She also wants to tell us that she was
able to regain her sanity because of other people, not in spite of
them _ that there were friends, male and female, who did and said
the right things, and that even though she had endured one of the
most isolating of crimes, she knew that she was not alone. This is
a fierce and ultimately moving book. It isn't an easy choice to
make, but anyone who reads it will be better for it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MORGAN: AMERICAN FINANCIER &QL; 
 &UR; Jean Strouse (Random House, $34.95)
</P>
<P>
   Edward Steichen, who took J. Pierpont Morgan's photograph when
the financier was an old man, said that meeting his gaze was like
looking into the lights of an oncoming express train. A woman who
knew Morgan well told Strouse that when he entered a room ``you
felt something electric. He wasn't a terribly large man but he had
a simply tremendous effect _ he was the king. He was it.'' When
Morgan died in 1913 at age 75, his estate was valued at $80 million
and he was the most powerful banker in the world, organizer of
giant railroad systems and corporate trusts, and the man who had
helped transform an agrarian society into one based on modern
industry. He had many critics (one senator called him ``a beefy,
red-faced, thick-necked financial bully, drunk with wealth and
power''), but he was deaf to the claims of his adversaries. Oddly
enough, this most powerful man struggled with depression and
feelings of worthlessness. He had no conversational skills, and
even his appearance created trauma for him (Morgan suffered from a
skin disease that turned his nose into a swollen purple bulb).
Working from material unavailable to previous biographers, Strouse
has written a lively, if long (700 pages) biography of the man who
was cast as the high priest of capitalism, and whose actions nearly
a century ago raise questions that are at the center of the
financial news today. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; STANDING IN A RIVER WAVING A STICK &QL; 
 &UR; John Gierach (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23)
</P>
<P>
   We had never read a book by Gierach before, but we admired his
titles (others are ``Sex, Death and Fly-fishing'' and ``Another
Lousy Day in Paradis''e), so we ventured into new territory in the
hopes that we'd discover something wonderful _ a Tim Cahill of the
fly-fishing set, maybe, or a stick-waving cross between Steve
Martin and Norman Maclean. At first, Gierach's voice sounded folksy

that we weren't listening anymore, that we were looking at the page

IN STORM'S WAKE, LITTLE LEFT OF A LITTLE TOWN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ There was never a whole lot to Bridge
Creek. The church. The school. The Pinetree grocery. Ollison's
convenience store. And perhaps 8,000 residents, a mixed community
of farmers who have lived here for decades and Oklahoma City
commuters who have flocked here more recently in search of space
and solitude.
</P>
<P>
   But now, there is a whole lot less to Bridge Creek. The
merciless series of tornadoes that flattened this area some 30
miles southwest of Oklahoma City on Monday left little but massive
piles of wreckage and the mangled memories that neighbors plucked
from the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people _ eight women, two men and one infant _ died here
in Monday's storm, the largest group among the 38 killed throughout
Oklahoma. Scores more were injured and five are still missing,
according to Grady County Sheriff Stan Florence. The Oklahoma State
Patrol estimates that 235 houses in this unincorporated area were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   When Jeannette L. Ralston emerged from the sturdy storm cellar
that her husband built of landscaping timbers 20 years ago, she
came up with one word to describe the devastation caused by the
twisters that had just churned through. ``Hiroshima,'' she said.
``It just looked like the pictures of Hiroshima. When we came up,
everything was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The landscape here is utterly torched. The storms left a
6-mile-long skid mark on the earth, a blighted wasteland that is
nearly a mile wide in some places. Houses and mobile homes are so
thoroughly demolished that residents are not sure where their
rubble ends and their neighbors' begins. Trees are denuded, as if
whittled by God's hand, and many are wrapped with ribbons of sheet
metal. Barbed wire is strewn everywhere, and property is fenced by
fallen electric cables.
</P>
<P>
   Because this area was largely rural, the ground was littered
Tuesday with the corpses of horses and cows and pigs, their legs
pointing stiffly skyward. On Tuesday afternoon, as National Guard
helicopters surveyed the damage from above, relief workers riding
backhoes began plowing graves for the livestock. ``My son saw a
full-grown cow that had been impaled on a broken power pole,''
Raltson said, ``just like a shish kebab.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence, the sheriff, said the loss of life may have been
particularly severe here because the area had a high concentration
of mobile homes and had no warning sirens, leaving people to rely
on television and radio reports for information about the
approaching calamity.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston said that she and her husband discovered two bodies, one
male and one female, at a nearby house shortly after the storm
passed. Although she knows her neighbors, she did not know these
people, or at least did not recognize them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to identify them but I couldn't,'' she said. ``The
bodies were so mangled. They must have come from someplace else.
They were completely nude and the way they were injured I think the
wind had stripped them. The woman had a huge hole in her right side
and the man was just laying there as if he didn't know what had
happened, just in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said his tired troops had been buoyed by one bit of
good news. A missing woman who had been separated from her
six-year-old son was found Tuesday afternoon under layers of debris
near her house. Though she had been missing for nearly 24 hours,
she was in good condition, the sheriff said. ``That gives us some
hope and spurs us on to look a little harder,'' he said, although
he added that the entire area had now been searched.
</P>
<P>
   Many Bridge Creek residents did hear about the storm in time to
escape on Monday afternoon, with many speeding to Oklahoma City as
the swirling charcoal clouds chased them from behind. Some trickled
back in the darkness, armed with flashlights and sneaking around
police roadblocks, only to find concrete foundations where houses
once stood. Others returned Tuesday and began the unimaginable
process of surveying their losses, checking on neighbors, mourning
the dead and searching for faith.
</P>
<P>
   Linda J. Wood spent the afternoon tearily scanning her property
for keepsakes like a beachcomber searching for sharks' teeth. She
unfolded her hand to show the day's bounty. ``Here's my mother's
i.d. bracelet, her wedding ring, my diamond heart necklace,'' she
said. ``The chain's gone but the main thing is here. We just found
it lying on the ground. It was on a shelf in my bathroom and as you
can see the bathroom is gone.'' As she spoke, her daughter, Angela,
exclaimed: ``Oh my gosh, it's Grandma's coin,'' she said, plucking
an 1884 silver dollar from the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Wood could not figure out what had become of the six-foot-long
freezer chest where she stored meat and other perishables. ``Who
knows where it is,'' she said. ``Do you see it? Oh, that might be
the lid over there in that tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the dirt road, Dennis L. Fellin, a 39-year-old computer
technician who was planning to build a house on the plot where his
trailer once stood, let out a whoop when a friend found a baby
picture of his 7-year-old son in a heap of trash. ``All right,'' he
said. ``There's baby Joseph.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellin had already made another important discovery. A neighbor
had found his 6-year-old dalmatian, Cira, hiding in a car and had
just returned the dog. ``She's a little sheepish,'' he said,
glancing toward the seemingly confused dog, ``but she's fine.'' His
father's old pickup truck, a gift from his mother after his
father's recent death, was a different matter. The wind had lifted
it out of his driveway and deposited it in a field 150 yards away.
It looked as if it had been firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   As is so often the case with tornadoes, the ones here seemed
remarkably discriminating in what they left in place and what they
tossed aside. Heather J. Dawkins, a 27-year-old mother of three,
T-ball coach and church youth director, could not understand how
the storm had left a file folder seemingly untouched atop a cabinet
in her now nonexistent bedroom. ``It was still sitting there,'' she
said, ``in the bedroom with the wall gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Like virtually all of the victims interviewed here Tuesday,
Dawkins said the killer storm had done nothing to vanquish her deep
Christian faith. ``That's why I can look at this and still have a
smile on my face,'' she said. ``Because I know who's in control of
things even when a whole town gets blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom R. Duckett, the 45-year-old ponytailed preacher at
Ridgecrest Baptist Church, made similar observations as he stood
within his destroyed church, where collapsed girders groaned in a
strong, dusty wind. While the school complex and the community's
stores survived, its house of worship did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why all things happen,'' he said, backed by a
crumbled brick wall. ``I just know the Lord walks through them with
us. I don't think the Lord ever said in Scripture that there
wouldn't be hardship. This is just life.''

SENATE BEGINS FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The US Senate, making another attempt to pass a
bill that has failed about a dozen times in the past two decades,
Tuesday began considering a measure to wipe out Depression-era laws
that prevent banks, brokerages and insurance firms to enter each
other's markets.
</P>
<P>
   Because industry squabbling and political considerations have
killed the bill many times, few people are predicting outright that
it will become law this year. ``But you have industry consensus and
bipartisan agreement that the time is long overdue for this,'' said
Dan Zielinski of the American Insurance Association. ``So the stars
seem to be aligning here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the laws that regulate financial securities firms date
to the Depression, when lawmakers feared that risky business
activities should be segregated from the banking system so that
they do not harm the broader economy.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, industry leaders and regulators have said
the US financial system includes enough safeguards so that American
firms can safely form the kind of ``financial supermarkets'' that
are now common in Europe and Japan, where banking services,
insurance, mutual funds, and stocks are sold under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Given the wide array of business interests affected by the bill,
the number of disputes this year is small.
</P>
<P>
   One set comes from consumer advocates. The Senate bill ``gives
everything to industry and nothing to consumers,'' said Mary
Griffin of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Senate should require banks, for example, to offer
services at a reduced cost to low-income people. In addition, she
said, it should require the financial conglomerates of the future
to disclose what kind of customer information is being shared among
the bank, brokerage, and insurance units, and to allow consumers to
block the sharing of that information.
</P>
<P>
   Without that protection, she said, an insurer might be able deny
insurance coverage to a person merely because he or she bounced a
lot of checks. A mortgage company might deny a loan to someone
based on his or her health insurance records, she suggested.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton Tuesday unveiled a package of measures that
aim to protect consumers against the increasing trend toward
information-sharing among banks, insurance companies, and
securities firms. Griffin said consumer advocates would seek to
attach the package to the Senate's financial services bill.
</P>
<P>
   An even more prominent debate involves how the new law would
affect the existing Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. The
22-year-old CRA requires banks that collect deposits in low-income
and minority communities to make sure that some of that money goes
to work in those neighborhoods in the form of loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CRA is one of the crowning achievements of the Civil
Rights Movement,'' said Wade Henderson, executive director of the
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. ``With the CRA, our
neighborhoods have a chance of developing, and without it they are
victimized and discriminated against.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who leads the
Senate banking committee, says the bill gives community groups too
much power to demand cash payments and commitments to loan programs
for low-income people. On the Senate floor Tuesday, Gramm appeared
to criticize the Boston-based Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of
America for its confrontational tactics in securing loan
commitments from banks. He did not specifically name the group.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's version of the bill would give community groups only a
limited right to use the CRA to block mergers between banks that
have been given a ``satisfactory'' rating by regulators for CRA
compliance. Opponents say this would make the CRA far less
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Another major debate concerns the financial structure of banks
that want to enter the insurance and securities businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and some other
regulators want these banks to create a holding companies that
become the parent of separate banking, insurance, and brokerage
units. They say this will protect taxpayers, who insure bank
deposits through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and who might
have to cover bank losses due to insurance or brokerage activities.
</P>
<P>
   Other regulators say that banks should be able to run insurance
and brokerage businesses as operating subsidiaries of the banks.

INVESTOR SHIFT IS SUGGESTED AS TREASURY PRICES DROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices dropped sharply Tuesday, pushing
long-term interest rates to their highest level in nine months.
</P>
<P>
   There was no significant economic news to prompt the selling,
said traders and analysts, who instead cited a shift in view among
bond investors.
</P>
<P>
   The selling has pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up
almost a quarter of a percentage point in just three trading days.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading in the Treasury market Tuesday, the price of the
30-year bond dropped 25/32 to 93 15/32; the yield, which moves in
the opposite direction, jumped to 5.71 percent, from 5.65 percent
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, investors are losing the conviction that the U.S.
economy will slow this year, with inflation remaining in check;
instead, a growing number worry that a rebound in the rest of the
world will keep growth strong here and _ combined with a rise in
the prices of oil and other commodities _ will nudge inflation
higher.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in prices should not be large _ from 1998's 1.6 percent
increase in the Consumer Price Index to an expected rise this year
of 2 percent or more. But investors appear to fear that this
acceleration may still be enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates to slow economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are becoming increasingly aware that the global
economy is improving and that the prospect for low inflation is
less, while the prospect for higher inflation has increased,'' said
Richard Berner, the chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   This outlook on inflation and growth, he added, means that the
Fed is likely to raise interest rates by the first quarter of next
year, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates, and the fear of inflation that would
cause them, are a threat to the stock market, which retreated
Tuesday after the Dow Jones industrial average topped 11,000 points
for the first time Monday. Tuesday, the Dow dropped 128.58 points,
or 1.2 percent, to 10,886.11.
</P>
<P>
   But so far this year, equity investors have ignored the rise in
rates, which has seen 30-year bond yield shoot up from a low of
5.05 percent in January. But at the current level, according to the
valuation model used by Byron Wien, the U.S. investment strategist
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the stock market is overvalued by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign of concern about an impending rise in the federal
funds rate, the central bank's interest rate target, the yield on
the fed funds futures contract for December has jumped to 5 percent
since Thursday. The fed funds target is now 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Connor, the head government trader at J.P. Morgan
Securities, said a Morgan survey showed that money managers, who
had been betting on an economic slowdown here and a bond rally,
were changing their views.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, he said, 89 percent of the money managers
surveyed were at or ahead of their performance benchmarks in terms
of their bet on bonds _ meaning many were expecting a rally. But
now the survey shows the percentage has dropped to 75 percent.
Reducing bond exposure in this direction means selling.
</P>
<P>
   Connor also said there was a lot of selling because investors
were switching from Treasury securities to corporate and other
bonds, which offer higher yields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wake-up call for a bond manager,'' said N. Graham
Allen, managing director of global fixed income for Wells Capital
Management. He still believes that this is just a wide swing in a
trading range that will see bond prices rally and yields fall
again. But he admitted that the bond market ``is a little shaky at
the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Slifer, the chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers also
argues that investors are overreacting. He said that the 1.4
percent rise in the inflation measure for the gross domestic
product is overstated. It was the report of that rise Friday, along
with the news that the economy grew at 4.5 percent during the first
quarter, a rate much stronger than expected, that set off the
latest round of bond selling.
</P>
<P>
   He also says that while some commodity prices have risen
recently from their lows for the year, they have not had the kind
of surge that amounts to an inflationary threat.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledges that right now this analysis does not matter
in the bond market. ``While I may kiss this off,'' he said, ``there
is nothing that says that interest rates can't go up in the near
term.''

STATE DEPARTMENT CLEARS U.N. NOMINEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department's inspector general said
Tuesday that she had cleared Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's
nominee as chief U.S. diplomat to the United Nations, after an
investigation of speaking fees that he accepted while working as an
unpaid White House envoy to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to close the investigation removed one more
roadblock from Senate confirmation of Holbrooke, whose nomination
to the U.N. post has been stalled for months.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional officials said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, would not allow
the nomination to advance further until the Senate had received a
variety of internal documents from the Justice Department about an
earlier ethics investigation of Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Inspector General Jacquelyn Williams-Bridgers
said Tuesday that her office ``initiated an investigation based on
information that Ambassador Holbrooke inappropriately received
compensation for speaking and writing on activities that were part
of his official duties.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, the statement said, ``did not find evidence
of a clear violation of the standards of conduct and the Office of
Inspector General closed the investigation'' last Friday. She
offered no details on her reasons for dropping the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's lawyer, Richard Beattie, said that the outcome was a
``complete exoneration'' of the veteran diplomat, and that
Holbrooke's nomination should now be able to advance in the Senate.
``There was no evidence of any wrongdoing,'' Beattie said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was the second by the inspector general. The
first ethics investigation, conducted with the Justice Department,
delayed Holbrooke's nomination by eight months and ended with
Holbrooke's agreement in February to pay $5,000 to settle civil
charges that he had violated federal lobbying laws. He denied
wrongdoing at the time of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The second inquiry, which threatened additional delays in Senate
hearings for Holbrooke, was prompted by an opinion article in The
Washington Post in March that questioned whether it was proper for
Holbrooke to receive lecture fees for speaking about the current
situation in the Balkans while serving as a special presidential
envoy to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said investigators focused on a speech that Holbrooke
gave last November at Stanford University, for which he was paid
$16,000.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, Holbrooke had been named an unpaid envoy to the
Balkans, focusing on the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said the investigation showed that the speech had
centered not on recent developments in Kosovo, but on broader
foreign policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech was about foreign policy and the need to have a
foreign policy,'' Beattie said. ``He threw in a couple of anecdotal
things at the end, and he used Kosovo as an example. But the speech
wasn't about Kosovo at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms has not yet scheduled a confirmation hearing for
Holbrooke, whose formal nomination was submitted by the White House
to the Senate in February.
</P>
<P>
   And while the senator's staff had no comment Tuesday on
Holbrooke's nomination, congressional officials said that Helms
would not organize the hearing until the Foreign Relations
Committee had received a variety of Justice Department documents
about the original ethics investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One other roadblock to the nomination was recently removed after
the Clinton administration and Helms reached agreement on
legislation to pay back dues to the United Nations in exchange for
reforms within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, a former ambassador to Germany who was the architect
of the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 that ended the war in Bosnia,
has found himself a case study for the ethical mine fields faced by
former officials who agree to return to work for the government
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier investigation, prompted by an anonymous letter to
the State Department, focused in part on accusations that Holbrooke
had illegally lobbied his former government colleagues at the U.S.
Embassy in South Korea shortly after resigning from the State
Department in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to the $5,000 settlement with the Justice
Department, Holbrooke denied wrongdoing and insisted that he had
agreed to the settlement only to avoid further delays in his
nomination.

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ President Clinton was scheduled to meet here
Wednesday with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana to update him
on diplomatic efforts to end the alliance's air war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who left Washington late Tuesday for the
overnight trans-Atlantic flight, also planned to meet with the NATO
commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, and with the three American
soldiers released from Yugoslav captivity over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the White House on Tuesday, Clinton vowed ``to seize
every diplomatic possibility,'' for ending the conflict on NATO's
terms. At the heart of those terms is the demand that ethnic
Albanian refugees be allowed to return ``safe and secure'' to their
homes in the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what our effort in Kosovo is all about,'' said
Clinton. `` Whatever can be negotiated, it is not that.''
</P>
<P>
   After six weeks and nearly 4,000 attack sorties, U.S. and allied
attacks are increasing ``in intensity and impact,'' Clinton said,
following NATO's single most successful day yet in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During the 24-hour period that ended early Tuesday, NATO bombs
struck 80 targets, ranging from individual tanks and artillery
pieces in the field to fixed ammunitions dumps and command and
control centers, by far the most targets hit since the punishing
air campaign began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO pilot flying an F-16 shot down a Yugoslav MiG 29 fighter
Tuesday, the first such shoot down since the early days of the
campaign, as it streaked to within two miles of the Bosnian border.
</P>
<P>
   Clear skies and around-the-clock strikes have helped allied
pilots with increasingly aggressive search and destroy missions
against Serb forces dispersed across the Kosovo, a province of
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign intensifies, the Pentagon acknowledged for the
first time Tuesday that B-52 Superfortress heavy bombers have begun
pounding Yugoslav forces in the field with mass drops of 500-pound
bombs. Dumped 54 at a time, the bombs cut a lethal swath the length
of three football fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just keeps rolling and keeps rolling,'' Air Force Gen.
Charles Wald said of the air campaign targeting the forces of Serb
leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia. ``I doubt very
seriously if he has any idea how bad he's being hit right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As the strikes have intensified, so has the risk to U.S. pilots
and to civilians on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said, though, that he had calculated the number of bombs
dropped and the number that have killed or injured civilians thus
far, and found that 99.93 percent of NATO bombs had not caused
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said there would be some collateral damage; we've had some
of that,'' said Wald. ``But I think over a 41- or 42-day period,
with that many bombs, that's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wald, `` I think if you look at Milosevic's record, I'd say
99.9 percent of his targets
</P>
<P>
   are collateral damage, so kind of take it for what it's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the escalating war, however, Clinton spoke of the prospects

</P>
<P>
   In departure remarks on the South Lawn of the White House,
Clinton said he told Russia's special envoy to the Balkans, Victor
Chernomyrdin, that he was devoted to seeking a diplomatic solution
to the Yugoslav conflict, even as he pursues an increasingly
aggressive air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reaffirmed our support for his efforts and our willingness
to seize every diplomatic possibility for Serbian authorities to
meet the requirements that NATO has articulated,'' Clinton said of
his meeting Monday with Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of ongoing talks between Clinton and Chernomyrdin
is the issue of how to constitute a peacekeeping force that would
deploy inside Kosovo once the conflict concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ``there is no middle ground,'' however, on the
question of security for the estimated 1.8 million ethnic Albanians
who have fled their homes in the face of military repression inside
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clarifying a comment he made Monday concerning the composition
of such a force, Clinton said the force must have ``NATO at its
core.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is traveling here with Defense Secretary William Cohen,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Gen. Hugh Shelton, and National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to travel to Germany's Ramstein Air Base
on Wednesday to visit with the American soldiers released over the
weekend and to speak with U.S. pilots at a base at Spangdahlem.

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ President Clinton was scheduled to meet here
Wednesday with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana to update him
on diplomatic efforts to end the alliance's air war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who left Washington late Tuesday for the
overnight trans-Atlantic flight, also planned to meet with the NATO
commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, and with the three American
soldiers released from Yugoslav captivity over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the White House on Tuesday, Clinton vowed ``to seize
every diplomatic possibility,'' for ending the conflict on NATO's
terms. At the heart of those terms is the demand that ethnic
Albanian refugees be allowed to return ``safe and secure'' to their
homes in the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what our effort in Kosovo is all about,'' said
Clinton. `` Whatever can be negotiated, it is not that.''
</P>
<P>
   After six weeks and nearly 4,000 attack sorties, U.S. and allied
attacks are increasing ``in intensity and impact,'' Clinton said,
following NATO's single most successful day yet in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During the 24-hour period that ended early Tuesday, NATO bombs
struck 80 targets, ranging from individual tanks and artillery
pieces in the field to fixed ammunitions dumps and command and
control centers, by far the most targets hit since the punishing
air campaign began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO pilot flying an F-16 shot down a Yugoslav MiG 29 fighter
Tuesday, the first such shoot down since the early days of the
campaign, as it streaked to within two miles of the Bosnian border.
</P>
<P>
   Clear skies and around-the-clock strikes have helped allied
pilots with increasingly aggressive search and destroy missions
against Serb forces dispersed across the Kosovo, a province of
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign intensifies, the Pentagon acknowledged for the
first time Tuesday that B-52 Superfortress heavy bombers have begun
pounding Yugoslav forces in the field with mass drops of 500-pound
bombs. Dumped 54 at a time, the bombs cut a lethal swath the length
of three football fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just keeps rolling and keeps rolling,'' Air Force Gen.
Charles Wald said of the air campaign targeting the forces of Serb
leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia. ``I doubt very
seriously if he has any idea how bad he's being hit right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As the strikes have intensified, so has the risk to U.S. pilots
and to civilians on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said, though, that he had calculated the number of bombs
dropped and the number that have killed or injured civilians thus
far, and found that 99.93 percent of NATO bombs had not caused
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said there would be some collateral damage; we've had some
of that,'' said Wald. ``But I think over a 41- or 42-day period,
with that many bombs, that's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wald, `` I think if you look at Milosevic's record, I'd say
99.9 percent of his targets
</P>
<P>
   are collateral damage, so kind of take it for what it's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the escalating war, however, Clinton spoke of the prospects
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   In departure remarks on the South Lawn of the White House,
Clinton said he told Russia's special envoy to the Balkans, Victor
Chernomyrdin, that he was devoted to seeking a diplomatic solution
to the Yugoslav conflict, even as he pursues an increasingly
aggressive air campaign.

8 EUROPEAN STOCK EXCHANGES FORM ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Edging closer to the vision of a unified
European stock market, eight stock exchanges agreed Tuesday to
develop a common trading system for stocks in Europe's biggest
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The eight exchanges are those of Frankfurt; London; Paris;
Amsterdam, Netherlands; Brussels, Belgium; Madrid, Spain; Zurich,
Switzerland, and Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is a step toward eliminating the inefficiency of
Europe's stock exchanges, which play a much smaller role in the
overall economy than their counterparts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the allure of creating one big market and taking
advantage of Europe's single currency, the euro, the exchanges are
still divided by rivalries and are feuding over the kind of system
to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tuesday's agreement was an attempt to soothe the anger
of France and several other countries, which were shocked last July
when the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges _ the largest and
second-largest in Europe by market capitalization _ announced their
plan for a joint-trading system and merely ``invited'' others to
join.
</P>
<P>
   The move was particularly galling to executives at the Paris
Bourse, the third-biggest exchange in Europe, who did not learn
about the Frankfurt-London deal until it was publicly announced. It
was also troubling that Frankfurt was teaming up with an exchange
outside the 11 nations that use the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the smaller exchanges have vacillated between the
anxiety of being left out and the fear of being swallowed up.
Tuesday's agreement was the most concrete step toward
reconciliation, but those involved offered no clues about the
exchange's structure, trading hours, common rules, preferred stock
index benchmark or timetable, all key issues that must be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief signing ceremony in Madrid, which was chosen as a
neutral site, the eight exchanges ``underlined their commitment''
to bring their rules into agreement and eventually develop a single
electronic-trading system for stocks of Europe's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing a complex project, but it is possible and
necessary,'' said Antonio Zoido, chairman of the Madrid exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is essentially an endorsement of common goals, and
it is limited to trading in a fairly small universe of Europe's
biggest companies. It does not include Europe's fast-growing ``new
markets,'' the new exchanges, affiliated with the older ones, that
were created primarily for newer technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the French, Swiss and Italian stock exchanges said
they were continuing with plans for a ``virtual market'' that would
probably compete with the Frankfurt-London alliance.

GOLD BATTLE LOOMS OVER BUCKHORN MOUNTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Deep within a mountain in Washington state near the
Canadian border are microscopic veins of gold worth tens of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Battle Mountain Gold Co., a publicly traded Houston-based
company, is so convinced of the value of that gold that it claims
to have spent $80 million over the past seven years winning more
than 50 state and local permits and a variety of legal skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   But a month ago, Battle Mountain ran into a sudden and
unexpected obstacle: the Clinton administration announced that,
under a little-known provision of an 1872 mining law, the Crown
Jewel mining project could not proceed as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Now a largely local dispute over the future of Buckhorn Mountain
and its gold has turned into a congressional battle with national
implications.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are jobs in a depressed part of a booming state, the
health of the environment, and the future of mining in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., is so irate over the Clinton
administration's handling of the proposed mine that he is working
to get Congress to overturn the action.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has twice berated administration officials over the
issue. He has suggested that an overseer of the Forest Service
should resign, and upbraided Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt at a
public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton declined to be interviewed on the subject, but his
spokeswoman, Cynthia Bergman, said, ``We aren't going to give up
and roll over on this one. The people of eastern Washington and
Battle Mountain have been treated unfairly by this administration,
and we intend to seek solutions to rectify this manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., who represents the region, also is
eager to get the mine project moving.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, environmentalists and Indian tribes are raising an
alarm because they are fearful that Gorton will find a way to
revive the mine project while circumventing both public debate and
the presidential veto pen. The environmentalists say they have been
told by congressional staffers that Gorton and his allies will
attempt to attach a mine-friendly provision to an unamendable
budget unlikely to be vetoed by Clinton because it will include
money for the military operation in Yugoslavia or for hurricane aid
to Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next few days or weeks mining industry supporters will
likely attempt to attach in conference yet another
anti-environmental mining rider to the hurricane disaster relief
Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill,'' warns a letter going
to all members of Congress Wednesday from the Mineral Policy
Center, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please do not permit a last-second, stealth rider shielded
from public scrutiny to grant special favors to the mining industry
in one week when American citizens have been waiting for legitimate
mining law reform for over 125 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crown Jewel mine was rejected by both the Interior
Department and the Agriculture Department _ who together own much
of Buckhorn Mountain _ based on a provision of the 1872 mining law
largely ignored by the more mine-friendly Reagan and Bush
administrations. The provision, as interpreted by the Clinton
administration, limits the amount of surrounding land that the
company can use to dispose of its waste.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration claims Battle Mountain can still mine
Buckhorn Mountain using different methods, but the company and its
allies say the alternatives are impractical. The mining industry is
warning that if the administration's decision to block the Crown
Jewel project remains, it could stop virtually all future mining in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most outrageous decisions that has come out
of the Department of Interior in the last 20 or 30 years,'' said
Laura Skaer, the executive director of the Northwest Mining
Association, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has very little to do with the Crown Jewel project and
everything to do with Secretary Babbitt and his rogue solicitor
trying to leverage mining law reform. They are putting a gun to the
mining industry's head and saying `Agree to our form of mining law
reform and we'll call off the dogs.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the industry's critics say the brouhaha spurred by Crown
Jewel may be just what is needed to force mining companies to the
bargaining table for negotiations to change the nation's
127-year-old mining law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mining law gives away the nation's mineral wealth with no
royalties to the United States and very limited environmental
controls,'' said Stephen Suagee, reservation attorney for the
Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which oppose the
mine. ``Now, rather than have a public debate on the merits of the
mining law as it stands and ways in which it ought to be changed,
they want an exemption from the one part of the law that they've
discovered is no longer to their liking.''
</P>
<P>
   Interior officials say they will resist any effort to overturn
their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're opposed, of course, to Congress passing laws and then
attempting to exempt particular industries from those laws,'' said
Michael Gauldin, director of communications at the Interior
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The mine proposed at Buckhorn Mountain, expected to generate at
least 1.6 million ounces of gold, is supported by a variety of
local officials because of its potential to create jobs in a part
of the state left behind during the state's economic boom. In
Okanogan County, a rural county with 38,000 residents, the
unemployment rate was 11.6 percent in March, more than double the
state average of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okanogan County desperately needs something,'' said Wilbur
``Web'' Hallauer, an Oroville orchardist, onetime Democratic state
senator and former director of the state Department of Ecology.
``The timber harvest is way down. Apples took a hit last year. The
cattle business isn't very good. Anything we do with our natural
resource base is on the blink.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the state Department of Ecology, which has given a
green light to the Crown Jewel project, the mine would employ 144
people during its operation, which would be 24 hours a day for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists and the Colvilles oppose the mine because
of concerns about damage to the landscape. Battle Mountain is
proposing an open pit mine, a method of mining in which the company
would blow a large hole in the side of the mountain and then remove
large chunks of rock.
</P>
<P>
   The rocks containing gold veins would then be soaked in vats
containing cyanide, which is used to extract the gold.
</P>
<P>
   But the environmentalists worry more about sulfurous rocks that
would be exposed to the elements by the operation, and fear the
sulfer would contaminate water in area. The Indian tribes worry
that the water would harm mule deer, which form a major part of the
Indians' food supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine another use of the public land that so
transforms it from a rural pristine area to an industrial zone,''
said Roger Flynn, an attorney with the Western Mining Action
Project, which is fighting Crown Jewel. ``The waste rock will sit
there until the next Ice Age.''
</P>
<P>
   The mine's boosters say they don't believe the operation would
contaminate the environment, and that the company has done more
than enough to satisfy environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``No mining company has undergone the scrutiny this project has
endured, and met so many requirements,'' said Oroville Mayor Jimmie
Dale Walker. ``How can you take a company that has spent $80
million and tell them, `Oops, we're sorry?' What does this do to
relations between the business community and our federal
government?''

<P>
   The June issue of Cigar Aficionado magazine is back on
newsstands at Miami International Airport after authorities
rescinded a ban issued last week. The magazine was taken off the
shelves because its cover featured pictures of &UR; Fidel Castro &LR;  and
 &UR; Bill Clinton &LR;  with the headline, ``Is It Time to End the Embargo?''
</P>
<P>
   It also contained a travel guide to Cuba that was deemed
flattering to Castro. ``We don't want to be part of enhancing
Castro's government,'' said airport spokesman  &UR; Hernando Vergara &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The ban was lifted after the American Civil Liberties Union
threatened to sue, and Miami Mayor  &UR; Alex Penelas &LR;  ordered the
magazine placed on sale again, saying its removal ``goes against
some of the very principles which make this nation the free society
it is.'' Penelas also took pains to say the magazine's story was
``a total misrepresentation of the state of affairs in Cuba, which
recently was condemned in Geneva by the U.N. Commission on Human
Rights.''
</P>

 &UR; Ron Kalinin &LR; , manager of the produce department at the Safeway on

RELIEF SPECIALISTS WORKING TO PROVIDE BASIC NEEDS TO TORNADO
VICTIMS

<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ The initial pleas from Oklahoma are for the most
basic human needs _ water, electricity, light, medicine, money.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster specialists, utility crews, insurance agents, rescue
workers and an array of volunteers from North Texas are converging
on Oklahoma City to provide assistance to tornado victims and to
help ease the devastated region into what officials say will be a
months-long road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   From the underground Region VI headquarters of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in Denton, disaster specialists worked
through the night and day Tuesday devising an emergency services
strategy for the Oklahoma City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state told us they had a great need for power lines, water
and essential needs,'' said Carrie Moorehead, FEMA external affairs
specialist. ``We don't know a lot at this point because we're in
the initial stages and the state is struggling because it was so
widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   Waves of FEMA officials and disaster reservists began driving to
Oklahoma City about 4 a.m. Tuesday, ``pre-staging'' in anticipation
of President Clinton's declaration of a federal emergency, which he
signed just before noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That cleared federal officials to begin operations and freed up
federal money to pay for temporary housing for victims, as well as
home repairs not covered by insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   The cluster of tornadoes that ripped through the Oklahoma City
area downed phone lines, ruptured natural gas lines and scattered
utility poles.
</P>
<P>
   TU Electric/Lone Star Gas spokesman Ray Granato said 35
Metroplex workers _ including some from Arlington, Fort Worth and
the Hurst-Euless-Bedford areas _ have been sent to assist repair
efforts. An additional 35 contract employees also were released
from local duties to help the effort, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma Gas and Electric called this morning for assistance
and the crews were trying get on the road by 1 p.m.,'' Granato
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, they are prepared to stay a week. But that
could change depending on what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Because power was out across the region, up to 12 Southwestern
Bell offices in Oklahoma were running on generator power Tuesday,
said Bell spokeswoman Michelle Smith.
</P>
<P>
   To help displaced residents communicate with family and friends,
Bell is offering free call forwarding and voice messaging services,
Smith said. Free local calls can be made from existing
coin-operated phones and portable phone banks at emergency
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency relief volunteers from local religious organizations
remain on call Wednesday, ready to spring into action should
Oklahoma churches sound a call for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said, `We are ready as soon as you invite us to
come,''' said Rachael Sandifer, director of missions for the
Central Texas Conference of the United Methodist Church in Fort
Worth. ``We are ready with a first responder team.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, eight volunteers from the Tarrant Baptist Association
Disaster Relief Team were waiting word Tuesday afternoon from the
Baptist regional organization in Oklahoma, said Bobby Cox, director
of church and community ministry for the Tarrant County
association.
</P>
<P>
   To help search for survivors and victims, more than 10 seasoned
rescue specialists, including search dogs from the Metroplex, were
dispatched to Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 47 search and rescue specialists of the Texas Task
Force One Search and Rescue Team are on standby, an official said.
The team, which includes firefighters, paramedics and structural
engineers from across the state, is in Dallas this week for
training.
</P>
<P>
   Seven members of the Mark 9 Search and Rescue Team of Dallas and
seven search dogs were sent early Tuesday to Oklahoma City. Two
members of the First Response Search and Rescue Team of Keller
accompanied the Dallas crew, said Don Stephens executive director
of the Tarrant County group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our jobs would be to hunt for victims trapped in rubble,''
Stephens said. ``One dog can do the work of 50 searchers in
situations like this.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of four tactical/paramedics from the Denton County
Sheriff's Office also left Tuesday to help in the search for
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Arlington-area law enforcement agencies said they
are ready to help with relief efforts but are waiting to see what's
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield Police Chief Steve Noonkester said he sent a teletype
Monday night to officials in Chickasha, Okla., offering to send two
police officers and two police cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these types of situations it's a real drain on manpower,''
Mansfield Police Chief Steve Noonkester said. ``No one is allowed
in or out of the area for the next few days. It's a painstaking
process going through the debris.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 members of Allstate Insurance's national catastrophe
team were sent to the area to assist adjusters already based there,
said Justin Schmitt, a spokesman with Allstate's regional
headquarters in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   The team is equipped with what Allstate calls ``mobile rescue
units'' _ essentially oversized recreational vehicles that serve as
claims offices on wheels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They drive right into devastated neighborhoods and help
customers process claims on the spot,'' Schmitt said. ``Right now,
we're writing a lot of ALEs _ additional living expense checks _
which we issue immediately.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   M. Douglas Ivester, the mastermind of Coca-Cola's worldwide
bottling network, stood by like a proud uncle through most of the
1990s as the company racked up impressive gains in sales and
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company and this system have never been better equipped
or better aligned than they are today,'' Ivester, the chairman and
chief executive of Coca-Cola Co., said nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, though, Ivester's grand plan appears to be faltering.
Weak economies around the world have savaged many of the individual
bottling companies' profits. So the bottlers, from Sao Paulo to
Sydney, are turning to Coke to help them out, a move that is likely
to cost Coke hundreds of millions of dollars this year. The shift
is stunning, for the bottlers were supposed to be Coke's engine of
growth, not the parts needing copious amounts of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments are putting up some roadblocks, too. Ivester
has announced plans to buy several foreign brands, including
Orangina, the French citrus drink, with an eye to helping generate
the heavy volume needed to make his bottling network cost
effective. But those plans are being attacked by officials abroad
as threats to competition.
</P>
<P>
   As Coca-Cola's chief accountant, Ivester led the 1996 spinoff of
Coca-Cola Enterprises, which was Coke's first ``anchor bottler''
and has become its largest. He then urged smaller bottlers around
the globe to combine; by January of this year, he had built a chain
of 11 anchor bottlers, the most recent in Japan, with the argument
that a unified bottling system was the most efficient. Coca-Cola
has large investments in all 11 of those bottlers and in scores of
smaller ones as well.
</P>
<P>
   Coke earns money from the system on two fronts. It sells
concentrate to the bottlers, which mix it up, package it and sell
drinks like Diet Coke, Sprite and Fanta. Coke also receives
dividends on its bottling investments _ a 42 percent stake, for
example, in Coca-Cola Enterprises. At the same time, Coke bears
none of the enormous costs of bottling.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement works well in good times and can camouflage a
couple of trouble spots around the world. But when Coke's sales are
flat or declining in several markets, as they are now from Germany
and Japan to Brazil and South Africa, the system starts to sag.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Coke has both paid more to its bottlers to
help sell its drinks and collected less from its investment in
them. Dividend income from the bottlers fell to just $32 million in
1998, a 79 percent decrease from $155 million the previous year.
Meanwhile, spending on marketing and infrastructure payments to
bottlers soared to a record $1.84 billion, about 39 percent more
than in 1997. Some payments were made to ward off price increases
that bottlers wanted, but that also would have cut into sales
volume, and thus reduced demand for Coca-Cola concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman defended the pattern, saying it was spending
for the long term. ``We make these investments because the mission
of the Coca-Cola system is to build shareowner value over time,''
said the spokesman, Rob Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of last year's payments, $1.2 billion, went to
Coca-Cola Enterprises. But at least one analyst says similar
payments will have to be made to overseas bottlers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it in baseball terms, while CCE is in perhaps the
seventh inning, with the rest of the world Coke just threw out the
first pitch,'' said Michael Branca, an analyst for Lehman Brothers
who is concerned about what he sees as a split between growth in
sales volume and in per-share earnings at the company. Coke will
probably eke out volume growth of 5 percent or so this year, he
said, but at an extraordinary cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with volume growth of 5 or 6 percent in the second half,
we expect second-half profits to be flat with the second half of
1997, when volume and the stock price were considerably lower,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which rose to nearly $89 a share in July, bottomed in
September at $53.625 and closed Tuesday at $68.6875, a day after
Warren Buffett, the investor who holds a large stake in the
company, reiterated his confidence in the stock.
</P>
<P>
   While Branca is focusing on payments to other bottlers, other
analysts foresee no decrease in the amount paid to Coca-Cola
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Coke ever, in its wildest dreams, thought it
would have to make these kinds of payments to CCE,'' said Albert
Meyer, an analyst for David W. Tice &AMP; Associates, a Dallas research
firm. Meyer, who has been critical of the relationship between Coke
and Coca-Cola Enterprises, says many bottlers are ``maxed out after
years of feeding the parent's bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer has written a report saying that since 1995 actual cash
operating profits at Coca-Cola Enterprises have declined from 8.9
percent of revenue to 5.7 percent. Payments from Coca-Cola to the
bottler have made up the difference, he said, allowing profit
growth to track revenue growth at 14.8 percent for each of the last
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, a year when they couldn't make any money from their
customers, Coke provided the funds,'' he said, adding that he
expects Coke to pay at least $1.3 billion this year to Coca-Cola
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has already declared plans to spend close to $1 billion in
Brazil in the next three years. One anchor bottler doing business
there, the publicly traded Pan American Beverages, or Panamco,
reported Monday a loss of 31 cents a share for the first quarter,
its first loss. Coke's volume in Brazil declined by 13 percent in
the first quarter, 24 percent in Venezuela and 26 percent in
Colombia, other areas where Panamco is the major bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Under a program disclosed in April, Coke calls for price cuts of
15 percent to 20 percent in an effort to spur consumer sales. The
goal is to seize market share from less expensive local brands.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Panamco has little choice but to cut prices. ``Coke does not
permit its bottlers to promote a proprietary brand or a discount
brand,'' said Laura D. Meizler, an analyst for Salomon Smith
Barney. ``So at the beginning of the month, when a worker gets
paid, he will buy a Coke. But at the end of the month, he can't
afford it, so those sales go to some other beverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Panamco's debt load is also becoming unwieldy, ballooning to
$1.2 billion from less than $600 million 18 months ago. Nearly all
its debt is denominated in United States dollars, Ms. Meizler said,
so if the Brazilian currency was to fall further the debt would
swell yet again. A significant chunk of its debt stems from a 1996
purchase of a bottling company in Venezuela that had been a bottler
for Pepsico for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Another troubled anchor bottler is Coca-Cola Amatil, in Sydney,
Australia. The company is experiencing a sales slump in many Asian
countries, and its former chief executive, Norbert Cole, is suing
Coca-Cola over the decision to split the bottler into two parts
last year. The spinoff, Coca-Cola Beverages, includes much of
Amatil's former business in Europe and was more than 50 percent
owned by Coca-Cola at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Branca noted that the global bottling network is profitable only
if it handles the high volume it was intended to accommodate.
Mindful of that, Ivester has pursued other global-growth
strategies, including the $1.85 billion purchase of overseas
distribution rights to Cadbury Schweppes brands announced in
December.
</P>
<P>
   But that deal and an $880 million plan to buy the Orangina brand
from Pernod Ricard have been stalled by the governments of France,
Mexico, Australia and the competition commission of the European
Union. In hopes of winning French approval, Coke amended its
Orangina proposal Tuesday to allow French companies to continue
distributing the drink for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ivester has seemed surprised by the widespread opposition
to Coke having such a large share of certain soft-drink markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed with the Mexican competition authorities'
decision not to approve the proposed acquisition of Cadbury
Schweppes brands by the Coca-Cola Co. in Mexico,'' the company said
last week, adding that it planned to continue the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   With Cadbury Schweppes, Coke faces an uphill battle. All five
commission members there voted against the plan, and the
commission's head, Fernando Sanchez Ugarte, said Coke would have to
radically change its plan in Mexico to win approval. ``It's not
likely that they will make such a change,'' he said on Friday.
Germany is expected to rule on the proposed merger this Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's accounting of its payments to bottlers has also raised a
few eyebrows. James Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates and is
betting that the price of Coca-Cola Enterprises stock will fall,
says the payment from Coca-Cola that the bottler treated as income
last year should be treated as a straight expense by Coca-Cola.
``From Coke's perspective, they can have their cake and eat it
too,'' he said, adding that such payments mask declining growth in
cash flow at the bottler.
</P>
<P>
   A Coca-Cola spokesman said that the payments were treated as
prepaid expenses and other assets on the balance sheet, but
deducted ultimately from the equity-income line to reflect the
expense in that year.
</P>
<P>
   While that is permitted under accounting rules, it may not give
the most accurate picture of Coke's financial health, said Robert
E. Verrecchia, the Ernst &AMP; Young professor of accounting at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he said, such accounting ``makes their operating
income look higher.''

MONTENEGRO'S LATEST PROBLEM: AIDING ALBANIANS WHO ARE NOT
REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ULCINJ, Montenegro _ They were kicked out of their homes and
herded across the border, like so many other refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the 70,000 ethnic Albanians who came to Montenegro are
distinct from the others because they are not considered refugees.
They are citizens of the federal republic of Yugoslavia and they
have moved from one part of the republic, Serbia, to another part,
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Because these people were displaced within their own country,
they _ and the Montenegrin government _ are in a rather complex and
delicate position. Because they are not, technically, refugees,
relief agencies, particularly the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, are limited in how they can help.
</P>
<P>
   That means that even though many of the ethnic Albanians who
arrive here want to continue on into Albania, the United Nations
cannot provide the transportation, because that could be seen as
encouraging them to flee their own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``To recommend, advocate or support their becoming refugees is
difficult,'' said Robert Breen, head of the U.N. office in
Montenegro. ``We're not in the business of creating refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations does not just turn a blind eye to the
thousands who have come and continue to come to Montenegro.
Officially, they are considered ``internally displaced persons,'' a
bureaucratic phrasing that allows the United Nations to provide a
range of aid, in coordination with other relief agencies. Thus,
with the help of the government, more than 30,000 of these
displaced people have been transported to the main border crossing
with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Others have chosen to stay, perhaps to wait for other family
members or because they are afraid to wander too far from Kosovo.
They have been put up in tent camps, or in factories, mosques, or,
in one unusual case, a beach camp here in the resort of Ulcinj
where the beach is free and street signs are in Albanian as well as
Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other ethnic Albanians forced to leave their homes in
Kosovo, these people were not compelled to give their passports and
identification cards to Serbian forces. Their cars still bear their
Kosovo license plates.
</P>
<P>
   While their numbers are far smaller than the 350,000 who flooded
neighboring Albania, the Kosovars who crossed into Montenegro
represent over 10 percent of the tiny republic's population. They
are placing a heavy burden on the already shaky Montenegrin
government.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, there were an estimated 30,000 refugees
from the wars in Croatia and Bosnia still here in Montenegro before
the NATO strikes began March 24 and the new crowd of exiles started
to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Montenegro estimates that it costs more than
$8 million a month to care for the displaced Kosovars who have
settled here. That is an enormous expense for a government already
suffering from heavy unemployment and widespread business failures
caused by the war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing our best to accommodate them, but it's
difficult,'' said Dragisa Burzen, the deputy prime minister of
Montenegro, who has been handling refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Montenegro's connection to Serbia in the Yugoslav
republic, and wartime embargoes, it has been difficult for relief
agencies to bring in food and supplies, especially fuel. Breen said
he had spent more than a week trying to arrange a delivery of
diesel fuel to supply the vehicles of relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The people from Kosovo who have come to Montenegro arrived just
as tired and hungry as those who staggered into Albania or
Macedonia over the last five weeks. And the terror of being forced
out of their homes by army troops and special forces was just as
real as for all the others.
</P>
<P>
   But those who were forced by the army to come here are in an
exile unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   Although Montenegro does not consider itself to be at war, the
Second Yugoslav Army is based here and the consequences that
presents for the exiles can be deadly. About two weeks ago, the
Yugoslav Army moved into into an area along the border where
thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees were camped.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven ethnic Albanians, including a child and a woman,
were killed in what the army said later was an offensive against
the Kosovo Liberation Army, a group of ethnic Albanian rebels
fighting for the independence of Kosovo. The army's explanation
satisfied few people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes it's just a crime,'' said Burzen, who has demanded
a full public inquiry into the killings.
</P>
<P>
   After such an incident, displaced Kosovars could not help but
feel they had not found safe refuge in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the safest place to be,'' said Afija Arifaj, an
ethnic Albanian from the Kosovo town of Istok, near Pec, in western
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arifaj and her family were forced from their home but they
feel lucky to have resettled in what for them is a familiar place.
For the last few years, she and her family had spent two weeks of
their annual vacation at a small trailer camp in Ulcinj, which
before the war had been a popular destination for vacationers from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mrs. Arifaj was forced to flee Kosovo two weeks ago, she
has been living in a beige canvas tent set up by a French relief
agency inside the same trailer park she visited last year on
vacation. The ground they sleep on is hard and damp, and days
stretch on interminably with little to do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they know they are lucky, compared with other Kosovo
Albanians. ``We feel comfortable here because we know it,'' Mrs.
Arifaj said, sitting at a folding table with some friends. ``But I
never thought I'd be back here to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others among the 1,400 people who are now being sheltered
at the Neptun Camp also have memories of pleasant summer vacations
spent camping here. But now there are intrusions, including the
memories of the harsh treatment they received at the hands of the
Yugoslav Army as they were forced out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go into town I see the Yugoslav Army and I feel
harassed,'' said Ime Redzep, who escaped from the village of Istok
as the troops started burning the houses. ``They don't do anything
to me here, but just seeing them in their uniforms reminds me of
what those people did to us in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Others said they do not feel safe because the Montenegrin
government itself is so shaky right now. The Yugoslav Army here has
made menacing moves toward seizing power from the civilian
government, and members of the parliamentary opposition who support
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic are trying to whip up
anti-government sentiment that some analysts fear could lead to a
civil war or a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now I've felt safe but I don't know about the future,''
said Rizo Gashi, 40, who came from Pec three weeks ago with his
86-year-old mother. He worries the war might spread here, or the
army might try the same kind of ``ethnic cleansing'' as in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't know,'' he said, ``what's going to happen to
Montenegro.''

<P>
   In the early hours of June 8, 1924, a 38-year-old British
schoolteacher named George Mallory set forth with Andrew Irvine, a
28-year-old Cambridge student, from their canvas tent pitched
26,800 feet high on the northern slope of Mount Everest. Their
33-pound oxygen tanks, primitive and heavy by space-age standards,
worked well enough. After a spring of terrible conditions, the new
day dawning, Mallory reported through a sherpa, offered ``perfect
weather for the job'' _ a first ascent of the world's highest
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier why he wanted to climb Mount Everest, he had
famously quipped, ``because it is there.''
</P>
<P>
   But on their summit attempt, Mallory and Irvine vanished, last
seen by Noel Odell, a teammate who reported spotting two tiny
``objects'' moving across a distant snowslope before the mist
closed over them.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five years later, last Saturday, five young climbers
retracing the route said they found Mallory's body lying on a
windswept ledge at about 27,000 feet. But their discovery fell
short of resolving the persistent question of whether the two men
were the first to ascend Mount Everest, 29 years before Edmund
Hillary and Tenzing Norgay stood atop its 29,028-foot summit in
June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Sub-zero temperatures and dry air have left the body well
preserved, though details have yet to be released. Eric Simonson,
the leader of the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, announced
only that ``the remains were conclusively identified.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to other reports circulating within the climbing
fraternity, Mallory's leg was broken and his shoulder damaged,
suggesting that a fall must have contributed to his death. He was
tied to a length of climbing rope. Mallory's snow goggles, worn to
protect his eyes from the blinding glare of sunlight on snow, were
reportedly found in his pocket; if so, he might have removed them
once the sun went down. He was identified from the name on his
clothing, one person said, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of Irvine, but the discoverers, who descended
to Base Camp to rest up, promise to return for a more detailed
search.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystery of Mallory's and Irvine's disappearance is one of
the greatest unsolved adventure mysteries of the 20th century,''
said Galen Rowell, a photographer and climber who helped lead an
unsuccessful attempt on Mount Everest in 1983 from the Tibetan
side, where Mallory and Irvine launched their bid. ``At least part
of it is solved,'' Rowell said, ``and in a week or so when the
climbers go back up, we may learn more.''
</P>
<P>
   The discoverers, who are American, have expressed their
exhilaration on the expedition's website, Mountain Zone
(www.everest.mountainzone.com.). Conrad Anker, the first climber to
spot the body, reported seeing something ``whiter and whiter'' than
the surrounding rock and snow. When he climbed over to identify the
body, Anker said, ``he seemed to be at peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hahn, another member, said the team had expected to find
Irvine, but did not explain why. ``And so when we realized that it
was George Mallory, we were really blown away by that,'' Hahn told
Mountain Zone. ``We didn't want to disturb him. He'd been lying
there for 75 years, but at the same time, boy, we thought, what
better tribute to the man than to try and find out if he has
summited Mount Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   With wind blasting them at 27,000 feet, they searched for more
clues. Unable to dig a proper grave in the mountain's frozen flank,
the climbers, before descending, covered the body with rocks and
performed a brief memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered him up, and then it was just amazing,'' Hahn said,
``take one step away from there and you're not worried about George
Mallory's life anymore; one step away from him and you're worried
about your own life and falling down the North Face.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Brashears, a filmmaker who climbed to the summit of Mount
Everest four times, called it an outstanding feat for climbers to
mount a deliberate search at such a high altitude and in such
forbidding conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did was absolutely tremendous,'' said Brashears,
whose new book, ``High Exposure,'' chronicles his own attempts to
find Mallory and Irvine on the North Col. But he also said that
Mount Everest has had its dryest season in recent memory,
apparently baring the mountain enough to expose the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they return to that camp, they will be stronger and more
acclimatized,'' Brashears said. ``It will be very interesting to
see what they find in their second search.''
</P>
<P>
   Brashears, said that he could not know how much the climbers
have discovered. But he suggested that where Mallory was found
``could only be the site of an accident,'' because it well lay off
their route and several hundred feet below where an ice axe
believed to belong to Irvine was found in 1933. Based on his
earlier trips, Brashears said Mallory's body probably rested on a
rock terrace slanting much like a roof. ``It's a natural place for
two bodies, or a body, to have stopped its descent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Mallory and Irvine died while ascending
or descending Mount Everest may only be resolved if the metal Kodak
camera they carried is found undamaged, and the film has been
preserved by the cold. Brashears speculated that, because Mallory
was something of a celebrity, he might have had Irvine carry the
camera, to take his picture when they reached the summit.
</P>
<P>
   John Williamson, a former president of the American Alpine Club,
who joined Brashears on his 1987 attempt to find Mallory and
Irvine, said he thinks that the two reached the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they decided not to go for the top, given who they were,
they would have definitely made it down to camp,'' said Williamson,
who is now president of Sterling College in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Rowell, who wrote about Mallory and Irvine in his own book,
``Mountains of the Middle Kingdom,'' sounded unconvinced. But he
said that present-day climbers admire them as pioneers who
attempted Mount Everest ``when mountains were still exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   Brashears, who filmed the summit with a 42-pound camera for the
large-screen IMAX ``Everest,'' agreed that Mallory and Irvine faced
a more daunting challenge than mountaineers today because ``every
step was a step into the unknown of high altitude physiology, of
what's around the next corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Millikan, Mallory's grandson, said Mallory had been
ambivalent about returning to Mount Everest in 1924, because he had
already done two previous expeditions, in 1921 and 1922, and had a
young family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of got talked into going along on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Millikan, a builder and developer in Berkeley, Calif., and a
climber himself, shrugged off speculation over whether his
grandfather made the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would probably agree that it doesn't matter who
gets to the top of things first,'' Millikan said. ``He climbed for
the joy of climbing.''

ASTHMA FOUND IN 38 PERCENT OF CHILDREN IN NYC SHELTERS

 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A study has found that at least 38 percent of
homeless children in the city's shelters have asthma, more than six
times the national rate and more than double the rate found by an
earlier study of some of the city's poorest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, only 9 percent of the asthmatic homeless children were
on proper medication, according to Dr. Diane McLean, the author of
the study and director of the childhood asthma initiative of the
Children's Health Fund. The results have been presented at
professional meetings over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of inadequate treatment, almost half the
children already found to have asthma had made at least one trip to
a hospital emergency room in the previous year because of the
disorder, an irritation of the lungs that, if improperly treated,
can cause chronic breathing impairment and even death.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Suzanne Hurd, director of the division of lung diseases at
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said that even though
poor children in big cities are disproportionately affected by
asthma, she found the ``terribly high rates'' the study documented
among homeless children surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's of great concern,'' Dr. Hurd said, calling the study's
indications of undertreatment particularly important. ``If these
children had good medical care and someone showing them how to use
their medication, they should do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on checks from July through September last
year of all 393 children who entered two New York City family
shelters, one in Queens and one in the Bronx. Because families all
over the city are randomly assigned to the shelters as space
becomes available, the researchers consider these children
representative of the 8,685 children in 4,900 families who are in
the city's shelter system in any given month.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that remain unclear to researchers, the prevalence
of asthma is rising worldwide. But the problem is most acute in
cities, where studies have found it to be aggravated by poverty _
exposure to factors like cockroach feces, dust mites, mold,
dampness, rat and mouse urine and crowded living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The last national survey, in 1996, reported that 6.3 percent of
children in the United States have asthma. A survey conducted that
year in association with a seven-city study by researchers at the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine put the highest childhood
asthma rate in poor sections of the Bronx at just under 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The highest asthma rate reported by any previous study in New
York City was the 21 to 23 percent found last year in three
elementary schools in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx in a
survey by the New York City Health Department, which is conducting
its own childhood asthma initiative, a program of citywide asthma
education and prevention. But asthma had already been diagnosed in
30 percent of the homeless children involved in Dr. McLean's study,
and 8 percent of the rest showed persistent, moderate to severe
symptoms of the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astounding,'' Dr. McLean said. ``Asthma really is an
indicator of what's happening to the health of homeless children
and their living conditions in the broadest sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayvon Brown, now 3, seems typical of the children seen in the
study. His mother, April Brown, 33, said the boy's asthma kept
flaring up last year as his family spent almost five months
shuttling between the Emergency Assistance Unit in the Bronx, the
central office where homeless families apply for emergency shelter,
and a 10-day temporary shelter in Jamaica, Queens, where the
family's eligibility was still under review. Ms. Brown said she
repeatedly took Clayvon to emergency rooms, in part because it was
too far to travel to the medical clinic where she had taken him and
his two brothers, 8 and 10, when she lived in her mother's
apartment in Far Rockaway, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   While many families are found eligible for shelter the first
time they apply, city data show that half those eventually approved
have had to apply an average of five times, under rules intended to
insure that only families truly in need of emergency shelter are
allowed into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Hospital at
Montefiore Medical Center, said, ``We knew that the prevalence of
asthma had increased dramatically,'' he said, referring to national
studies that show a two-thirds increase in cases since 1980. ``But
even we who work with homeless children were taken aback by the
extent to which this vulnerable population was affected by this
debilitating, chronic disease.''

 &HT;    Deal between GM, AM General could bring jobs to midwest
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ AM General Corp., a maker of military vehicles,
is close to signing a deal with the General Motors Corp. to buy the
automaker's 6.5-liter diesel engine business in Moraine.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to GM told said the deal would create about 150
jobs once AM General takes control of the business, but the
agreement would not include the diesel engine plant. AM General,
headquartered in South Bend, Ind., will be forced to find an
existing site or build a plant for the diesel operation somewhere
in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our 6.5-liter diesel business is on the sale block and we have
been negotiating with a company for some time,'' said Dan Greene,
spokesman for GM's Powertrain Division. ``We have been asked by the
company not to identify them publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig MacNab, spokesman for AM General, said the company would
not confirm or deny the deal with GM.
</P>
<P>
   AM General and GM have been doing business together in Moraine
for more than a decade. All of the military vehicles manufactured
by AM General, which include the commercial HUMVEE, military jeeps
and trucks, are equipped with GM's Moraine-based 6.5-liter diesel
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The Moraine diesel plant employs about 500 workers. But the
plant is expected to be shut down in about a year after GM and
Isuzu start building 6.6-liter diesel engines at a new $310 million
plant, also located in Moraine. About 300 workers are going to be
shifted to the new diesel plant and the other 200 were expected to
be phased out through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said GM approached AM General about taking over the
6.5-liter business because the automaker still needs the older
engine for some of its vans and pick-ups trucks. Once the deal is
approved, AM general is expected to use some of the current work
force from the diesel plant and possibly hire some additional
workers.
</P>
<P>
   AM General apparently doesn't want to buy the building as part
of the deal because of its large size and cost.
</P>
<P>
   The hourly work force at the diesel plant is represented by the
International Union of Electronic Workers, which represents about
13,000 autoworkers in the Dayton area. Sources close to the deal
said one reason AM General would keep the diesel operation in
Dayton is because the IUE is a ``cooperative'' work force that has
been willing to accept tiered-contracts that pay new workers about
$8 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   AM General operates an assembly plant in Mishawaka, Ind.,
located east of South Bend, that employs about 700 hourly workers
who are represented by the United Auto Workers Local 5. The sources
said AM General didn't want the deal to become public because its
UAW work force would be angered by the IUE's involvement in the new
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for both unions were unavailable for comment on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   AM General's roots trace back nearly a century when the company,
under a different name, made wagons and bicycles. But its identity
changed in 1972 when American Motors purchased it and the company
started making military vehicles. It landed the HUMVEE contract in
1983 and now sells the ultra-rugged vehicles for anywhere between
$60,000 and $100,000. The company has sold about 6,000 HUMVEE's
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   AM General has 1,200 total employees at its Mishawaka plant, its
headquarters and at an engineering plant in Michigan. The company
generated about $392 million in net sales last year.

BANKING-LAW DEBATE IS REVIVED IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Md.)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate began debate Tuesday on a broad measure
to rewrite the nation's banking laws despite deep partisan
disagreements over both regulatory authority and existing
requirements that banks lend to members of minority groups and
others with little access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which Congress has spent the better part of 20
years struggling unsuccessfully to write, would be the first
comprehensive overhaul of the laws governing financial services
since the Depression. It would largely eliminate the barriers
between banks, insurance companies and securities brokers and allow
them to make more inroads into one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsed in principle by many powerful interests on Wall Street,
the legislation has nonetheless become bogged down in a regulatory
dispute between Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Federal Reserve, over who would oversee the
financial giants that would arise as a result of the new law. It
cleared the Senate banking committee two months ago on a party-line
vote of 11-9.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, President Clinton again threatened to
veto the measure, which was brought to the floor by Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of the banking committee. At an afternoon
briefing to announce his endorsement of initiatives to protect the
financial and medical records of consumers, Clinton said the
legislation would undermine the Community Reinvestment Act, which
encourages banks to lend to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will oppose any effort to weaken or undermine the continued
relevance of the Community Reinvestment Act,'' the president said,
adding that while the law has been on the books for two decades,
``over 90 percent of the lending under it has occurred in the last
six years in our administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud of that,'' he said. ``It has not done anything
to hurt bank profits, and we ought to stay with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation tilts toward giving more authority to the
Federal Reserve, in contrast to legislation moving through the
House that provides for a sharing of authority between the Fed and
the Treasury. By exempting 4,000 smaller banks and savings
associations from the Community Reinvestment Act and proposing to
make it harder for community groups to challenge minority lending
practices, Gramm has provoked strong opposition from many Democrats
and from civil rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The groups held a rally Tuesday denouncing the legislation as an
enormous step backward.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lobbyists from the banking, securities and insurance
industries expressed some optimism that an agreement might
ultimately be reached to rewrite the old laws, principally the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the legislation, which affects three of the
nation's wealthiest industries, has become a vehicle for House and
Senate members to raise campaign money. As such, few are willing to
publicly write off the chances of final passage of a measure.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the legislation Tuesday, Gramm called it the ``most
important banking bill in 60 years.'' He dismissed criticism of the
legislation's provisions regarding the Community Reinvestment Act,
saying that he was simply trying to put a level of
``accountability'' into the law by making it harder for community
groups to challenge the lending records of banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If CRA exams have any integrity,'' Gramm said, ``a bank that
receives three satisfactory exams in a row should have a
presumption of innocence when someone challenges the bank's right
to open a new branch or merge with another bank. That's why this
legislation simply asks challengers to provide proof that a bank
isn't in compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who has in the past suggested he was amenable to watering
down the provisions of his legislation on the Community
Reinvestment Act, suggested Tuesday that he was not inclined to
make such changes. ``It is better to have no bill than to have a
bad bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the banking
committee, introduced a substitute bill Tuesday afternoon based
largely on a measure that had sailed through the committee last
year and was supported by most Democrats and Republicans. It was
forged by former Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, who
headed the committee before his defeat last fall by Charles
Schumer. That legislation does not contain any provisions on the
Community Reinvestment Act and died last year largely after it was
opposed by Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we have a sharp contrast with last year's
bipartisan vote,'' Sarbanes said.
</P>
<P>
   The House is awaiting Senate action before deciding whether to
proceed with its own measure. That legislation, in contrast to the
Senate bill, has been supported by both senior Republicans and
Democrats on the House banking committee.

   WASHINGTON _ NATO's political leaders have overruled a draft
proposal by the alliance's senior commander to fire on ships that
defy an oil blockade against Yugoslavia, raising questions about
how effectively it could be enforced, officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although many countries are honoring the blockade, oil continues
to arrive in Yugoslavia by sea.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his NATO counterparts agreed to impose a
blockade during their summit meeting in Washington 10 days ago. But
some European allies, including Germany and France, objected after
the supreme allied commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, submitted an
enforcement plan last week calling for NATO warships to fire on
tankers that defy requests to be searched.
</P>
<P>
   Those allies have argued that the ban be made voluntary, saying
that the European Union's decision to stop selling oil to
Yugoslavia, effective May 1, would shut down the flow of oil by
stigmatizing violators.
</P>
<P>
   Since the European Union's ban took effect, however, a
Greek-owned tanker already defied it over the weekend at the
Montenegrin port of Kotor Bay, which is tightly controlled by
Yugoslavia's Navy, according to one defense official.
</P>
<P>
   The tanker, registered under the Maltese flag and called the
J.N.D. Friendship, is believed to have delivered nearly 20,000
barrels of gasoline or diesel fuel, which NATO says is critical to
Yugoslavia's war effort. Officials said they expected more
shipments in the days and weeks ahead. In April, there were 11
shipments, including one Russian tanker with more than 100,000
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's headquarters in Brussels, officials continued to
debate on Tuesday how to set up a ``visit and search'' embargo
program that would intercept vessels suspected of carrying fuel,
but would stop short of actually firing on them, either as a
warning or to disable the ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to force,'' one NATO official said. ``Do
we ask them, `Do you mind if we board?' or do we ask first but then
say, `You're not going to stop us.' General Clark wanted to have
more teeth in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The political wrangling over the naval blockade came as American
and NATO warplanes conducted another intense day and night of
bombings, striking 81 targets across Yugoslavia, including oil
storage tanks and armored forces operating in Kosovo, said
officials here and at NATO's headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the campaign's opening days, an
American F-16CJ shot down a MiG-29 on Tuesday in what officials
described as a short-lived air-to-air confrontation. The American
pilot intercepted the MiG, one of Yugoslavia's top fighter jets, as
it flew toward a squadron of allied aircraft that had just
completed an attack near the military airfield at Batajnica, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO jets have now shot down six Yugoslav fighters and destroyed
dozens more on the ground, including another MiG-29 and two other
aircraft at the Batajnica airfield overnight. NATO estimates that
six weeks of attacks have destroyed the bulk of the Yugoslav air
force.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the longest spell of good weather since the
air war began on March 24, warplanes again flew more than 600
missions.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, B-52's flew over Yugoslavia to attack an
airfield with 54 500-pound bombs that rely on gravity, rather than
the laser- or satellite-guided ``smart'' missiles. Until now, the
B-52's had fired cruise missiles from some distance outside of
Yugoslav air space.
</P>
<P>
   The intensification of NATO's air war has resulted in increased
reports of civilian deaths, including those killed when a NATO
warplane attacked a bus on Saturday. However, NATO denied
Yugoslavia's claims that a second bus was destroyed by a missile on
Monday near the town of Savine Vode in Kosovo, west of Pec, killing
20 people.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said commanders had reviewed
that day's raids and found no evidence that a NATO plane had
attacked any vehicles in the area.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate over the embargo has underscored the political
limitations placed on NATO's military campaign. From the start,
disrupting Yugoslavia's ability to refine oil into gasoline and
diesel fuel has been a major objective. NATO has already destroyed
the country's two main refineries, at Pancevo and Novi Sad, and
continues each day to hit storage tanks and oil-related targets.
</P>
<P>
   But with some 450,000 barrels of oil arriving at ports in
Montenegro in April, Clark argued that a naval blockade was needed
to cut off Yugoslavia's ability to receive refined oil products by
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Within NATO, the United States has argued that a blockade is
justifiable under international law as a means of depriving an
enemy of war materiel. However, a number of allies have argued that
without a formal declaration of war between NATO and Yugoslavia, a
blockade could only be binding if authorized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's draft proposal would have allowed allied warships to
intercept any vessel suspected of carrying oil into one of
Yugoslavia's two main ports, at Bar and at Kotor Bay, according to
NATO and Pentagon officials. The allied commanders would then ask
to board and review the manifest, after which they could ask those
found to be carrying oil to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The allied warships, under Clark's plan, would be able to fire
at those who refused to turn around or stop, first as a warning and
then to disable the vessels, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although American and NATO navy commanders have said a blockade
would be relatively simple to enforce, the idea has raised fears of
a confrontation with ships from other countries, particularly
Russia, which has vowed not to honor it. Some of the allies believe
that a confrontation could upset Russia at a time when its envoys
are acting as intermediaries between NATO and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a view that it could be counterproductive right
now,'' the NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, NATO's spokesman, said on Tuesday that the alliance could
begin plying the Adriatic in search of violators soon. He noted,
though, that the European Union's embargo was being joined by other
countries, including Hungary, which had agreed to turn off a
pipeline into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If oil is not leaving, then oil is not arriving, and a
visit-and-search regime, albeit important, becomes less
important,'' Shea said. ``And we have had an enormous success in
the wake of the Washington summit at making sure that the oil
doesn't leave in the first place.''

FARMING COMMUNITY OF BRIDGE CREEK AMONG HARDEST HIT BY TORNADO
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Updates with 6th graf on finding mother; subs for budgeted
story TORNADO-CHICKASHA) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEANNA BOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ A 6-year-old boy walked aimlessly along a
road in the Southern Hills subdivision amid twisted mobile homes,
crumpled cars and appliances scattered randomly amid the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   When a massive tornado struck the community Monday evening, he
and his mother were running to what they believed would be the
safety of a nearby creek, the boy told officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he saw the wind pick her up and take her off,'' said
Bob Paul, a deputy with the Grady County sheriff's office. ``When
they found him he was wandering the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Added deputy Dick McCoy: ``He was looking for his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   While the National Guard scoured the south side of Bridge Creek,
the 30-member volunteer firefighter department headed the search
teams in northern Bridge Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, the boy's mother was found trapped beneath a
pile of debris near her house, the New York Times reported. Though
she had been missing for nearly 24 hours, sheriff's officials said
she was in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the Bridge Creek community, specifically the
Southern Hills addition, was among the hardest hit in Monday's
deadly tornadoes that ravaged Oklahoma and Kansas. Officials said
11 people were killed in the farming community of 6,000 about 30
miles southwest of Oklahoma City, most of them in Southern Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Lindsey was among the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   As the mile-wide tornado headed toward her mobile home, she had
four screaming children at her side and a pickup in her back
driveway that wouldn't run. Lindsey, who was celebrating her 31st
birthday on Monday, grabbed bedding and sofa cushions and ushered
the family into the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, the walls were gone and only a kitchen
island and a few pieces of furniture remained of her home. Lindsey
and her four children, age 11 months to 9 years, crouched in the
rubble unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we lived through it,'' an almost cheerful Lindsey said
Tuesday as she and her husband James picked through the debris that
had once been their home. ``What better birthday than that? Happy
Birthday to me. Best present I ever got.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her neighbors weren't so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Grady County sheriff's officials tailing the huge tornado
arrived in Southern Hills to find bodies mingled with twisted
debris scattered across the hilly landscape. Among the dead were an
elderly woman and a 2-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Palmore, a volunteer firefighter, said his first discovery
was a family huddled together, the grandmother dying and a
3-week-old baby missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found (the baby's) body about 300 feet away in the trees,''
Palmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar wrenching scenes would be repeated throughout the night,
he said, but the memories he clung to were of finding people alive.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to take ambulances into the rural area, rescuers used
pickup trucks to load the injured, and later the dead. The Bridge
Creek school's gymnasium was transformed into a triage area; the
school cafeteria was a temporary morgue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that were alive, they were just covered with mud.
You just had to look and then suddenly you'd see a pink tongue or
white eyes,'' Palmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of the Lord in my heart,'' he added. ``The Lord
was around here (Monday) night. I think he saved my family and a
bunch of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady County sheriff's deputy Al Hooper said he believed
meteorologists' warnings to residents about the tornado spared many
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have that certain amount of people that say, `Oh,
it's not going to get me. It's not going to hit,''' Hooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it did.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The story creaks, the characters are stereotypes from another
time, the theatrical style doesn't work on modern audiences, but
oh, that music. It is as fresh as on the day it was born.
</P>
<P>
   Surely we're talking about ``La Sonnambula'' or one of its bel
canto opera pals, but what about ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' a musical
pulled forcibly from the past and now running strong at the Marquis
Theater on Broadway? Vincenzo Bellini and Irving Berlin have more
things in common than you think: not least, an infallible gift for
melody.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Bellini and Berlin were writing their immortal
tunes, they were also embedding them in a contemporary theater that
has proved anything but deathless. Take away the music, and ``La
Sonnambula'' (1831) is hopelessly silly. ``Annie Get Your Gun'' is
only 53 years old, but it is a revivalist's minefield.
</P>
<P>
   Much has happened since the 1946 original and its rebirth on
Broadway 20 years later. Stage techniques are slicker and attention
spans shorter. Political correctness has made its debut, with
antennas raised high in hopes of catching the racist or misogynist
red-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie Get Your Gun'' occupied a more innocent and carefree
time, when the American Indian could be made fun of and a woman's
place was in the home. In 19th-century Italian opera, cursory
disguises baffled hero and villain alike, plot coherence was of low
priority, and melodrama inflated normal behavior to twice its
customary size.
</P>
<P>
   Bellini today has an advantage over Berlin. ``Annie Get Your
Gun'' must update or die; audiences will stand for nothing less,
and their money keeps it on stage. Most opera doesn't even try. The
medium has long since made the necessary pact with its audience:
you put up with bad theater, and we give you beautiful music. I
know of no other art where suspenders of disbelief work so hard.
</P>
<P>
   What were the poor revivers of ``Annie Get Your Gun'' supposed
to do? The American Indian jokes had to go, but the reverse spins
that replace them are so self-conscious and apologetic that their
sincerity is dubious. Feminist editors snipe around the edges of
Annie's capitulation to the man of her dreams, but without a woman
who will do anything for love, including the sublimation of her own
gifts, there is no show.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Annie'' puts new things around old ones and trusts in
Bernadette Peters, an Annie of uncommon appeal. It has no choice.
</P>
<P>
   All the threats that face new productions of old operas are
repeated here. How do you make the primitive plot and subplots of
boy-meets-loses-wins-girl acceptable? This production makes them a
show within a show. What we are seeing is secondhand, a historical
artifact: theater not as it is now but as Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild
West Show knew it a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   How do you keep things moving when Ms. Peters isn't singing?
Current audiences pay a lot of money for sex and velocity, so
rump-wiggling choristers, tight costumes and a frenetic
choreographic pace are inserted. What results is two shows playing
simultaneously and against each other.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 show is meant to carry the 1946 original into the
present, but it only widens the gap between the present and the
past. Glitz and speed surround a simpler and less hurried work.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Berlin's music is coming to the rescue. ``The
Girl That I Marry'' and ``They Say That Falling in Love Is
Wonderful'' make us forget the confusions of style, just as ``Ah!
non giunge'' momentarily dispels the silliness of ``La
Sonnambula.''
</P>
<P>
   When faced with outdated theater, bad opera directors descend
into ridicule. How many times have we struggled through a ``Magic
Flute'' forced to emulate the animated cartoon. Particularly
repugnant a few summers ago was Rossini's ``Comte Ory'' at the
Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y.: a travesty of a travesty.
Younger Americans are usually responsible, directors whose
sensibilities are received from a childhood of Saturday-morning
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie Get Your Gun'' has traces of self-parody, but then it
has so many other tendencies as well. It sidesteps the total
update: the wholesale translation of people, places and things to a
contemporary setting. Think of Peter Sellars staging ``The Rake's
Progress'' in a California prison, ``Don Giovanni'' in the ghetto
or ``The Marriage of Figaro'' in the Trump Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The Sellars methodology can be striking, but finding
20th-century equivalents for an opera's every 18th-century word and
deed creates a far-fetchedness exceeding that of the originals.
``Annie Get Your Gun'' modernizes the harmonizations and
orchestrations of Berlin's music, something Sellars would never do.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Annie Get Your Gun'' falters because it has examined all
the ways of bringing a simpler show into a more complex world and
tried them all. Singly, it could have gone the early-music route by
precisely reconstructing the postwar musical.
</P>
<P>
   People try. ``As Thousands Cheer'' (also Irving Berlin) at the
tiny Greenwich Theater, not long ago, was a work of archeology if
not the embalmer's art, with every topical gag from 1933 in place.
The show attracted nostalgia-lovers, but the Marquis is a bigger,
more expensive place to fill.
</P>
<P>
   The best artistic solution may be to reduce staging or take it
away altogether. Les Arts Florissants from France and Yves Abel's
Opera Francais at Alice Tully Hall do it nicely, and the Opera
Orchestra of New York is performing ``La Sonnambula'' in concert on
Tuesday evening at Carnegie Hall. The listener's imagination
invents its own theater, much as enthusiastic audiences are doing
at the City Center's ``Encores'' series.
</P>
<P>
   But musicals in concert are hit-and-run: a few performances and
then gone. A Broadway ``Annie'' must be seen and heard, and it has
to last. Irving Berlin never stood a chance.

ORIGINS OF A BRAZILIAN ORIGINAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gilberto Gil, like Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa and Carlinhos
Brown, comes from the Brazilian state of Bahia. If the
Brazilian-music fetishism of the moment centers too heavily on that
northern region (and especially on the late-60s Tropicalia
movement), it doesn't change the fact that ``Ensaio Geral,'' a
12-CD set of early work by Gil, from 1967 to 1977, is an
extraordinary document _ a tracking of a distinctly Bahian but also
fairly universal pop artist's growth and achievement. Taken as a
whole, the set is one of the best arguments there is for the notion
of world music.
</P>
<P>
   Gil himself has bristled at the idea of ``world music,''
comparing it to the old-fashioned model of colonialist
exploitation, the ``attitude of the adventurer, the guy who comes
in search of novelty ... and enters the jungle saying, `Where are
all the rare specimens?,''' as he put it in a 1992 interview.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the big recent hits of the world-music genre _ albums
like Cesaria Evora's ``Cabo Verde'' or ``Buena Vista Social Club''
_ Gil's music isn't quaint or nostalgic. A North American can't put
this music on and enter an idealized land of the Other; on the
contrary, he'll feel shocked at how much feels familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ensaio Geral'' (it means ``General Rehearsal'') is as good a
place as any to fall in love with Brazilian pop _ to hear samba,
marcha frevo, bossa nova, the slow Afro-Brazilian processional
rhythm called maracatu and the accordion-driven forro. But it's
also a place to hear these Brazilian sounds fused with psychedelia,
blues, free jazz and a kind of ecstatic folk-rock.
</P>
<P>
   The set captures a kinetic performer, often pouring out his
music in a jam session of one. His voice scats, shoots up into
falsettos and punctuates songs with cries, and his acoustic-guitar
style advances from standard bossa nova self-accompaniment to a
quick-reflex improvisatory style.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, some of his Anglophone counterparts of the same
period _ John Lennon's early solo records or those by the Who, Led
Zeppelin, Traffic or Bob Dylan _ display the self-conscious
composure of a model in a formal portrait.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Ensaio Geral'' (Universal Brazil; no catalog number), the
listener can take the measure of Gil as a performer, songwriter,
musician and, significantly, band leader: even the previously
released albums come with unreleased tracks, contributing to the
sense that you're fully understanding Gil during each of the four
periods represented here.
</P>
<P>
   The box opens with ``Louvacao,'' his 1967 debut album, recorded
before the dawn of the Tropicalia era. At the time, Gil was a
second-wave bossa nova singer whose lyrics were coded with
intimations of social redemption to come, when the country's
military regime might end.
</P>
<P>
   He was a romantic, in the popular mode of singers like Elis
Regina; the album's complex orchestrations and production, by Dori
Caymmi, are calibrated to prolong a mood of relaxed melancholy. But
the romanticism feels mediated by the fashion of bossa nova; you
don't quite know who Gil is.
</P>
<P>
   That posture toward him changes radically one year later, when
we enter the next period and find Gil in the thick of the
self-questioning, bricolage-happy Tropicalia movement, whose aim
was to shake up Brazilian popular music by conflating electric
guitars and folk forms of the outback.
</P>
<P>
   His self-titled album from 1968 bears the thumbprints of the
producer Rogerio Duprat and is backed by the rock band Os Mutantes.
Without carrying explicit messages about Brazilian politics, the
metaphors in the songs are suddenly stronger; he sings about
hunger, death, bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But luckily for non-Portuguese speakers, so many of the delights
here are musical. The album creates shocking superimpositions with
a purpose: blaring horn sections, suggesting television
advertisements, sitting on top of indigenous folk rhythms. It's a
brilliantly colorful, polyglot album, the closest pop music ever
came to the restless esthetic prowling of a Godard film.
</P>
<P>
   The messages don't have to be articulated in political rhetoric;
the signals are there in the music like raisins in a cake: it's a
record about a sad populace stuck between the archaic and the
modern. Satisfactorily remastered at last, it's one of the best
rock albums ever made, though Gil is so much more than a rock
musician that one might not consider characterizing it as such.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are moments when you're aware that English-speaking pop
rubbed off on Gil. Traces of the Beatles' ``Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band'' can be found in the tape-edited
interactions between orchestral music and rock on the 1968 album;
the lead guitar is pure Eric Clapton in ``Nega (Photograph
Blues),'' from Gil's self-titled 1971 English-speaking album (his
three-year political exile in London was his third period).
</P>
<P>
   But after his return to Brazil in 1972, which initiates the
fourth period, the rock influence ends, or becomes a good deal less
direct. The album ``Expresso 2222,'' from 1972, has all of the
delicious denouement-of-an-era moodiness that characterizes the
canon of early-70s rock music _ that of Sly and the Family Stone,
the Grateful Dead, the German art-rock group Can.
</P>
<P>
   But the album is also deeply Brazilian: it includes a track by a
folkloric flute group from the Northeastern interior of the country
and a remake of the 1959 Brazilian hit by Jackson do Pandeiro,
``Chiclete com Banana.'' In the proper context of this collection,
one can see that the music of the Tropicalia period has been a bit
overrated; it wasn't until the 1970s that the movement's main
creators came into their own.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Gil special is that as a Brazilian of mixed ancestry
and mixed cultural influence, he felt multiple citizenships and
used it. As a black pop artist in the 70s, he absorbed the music of
Stevie Wonder and Bob Marley; in his London sojourn, he became a
band leader, comfortable with the informality and adventurousness
of rock, and as a Bahian he had a natural understanding of
Afro-Brazilian culture.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this mixture, when you get to the full-band tracks
on the double-disk 1972 live album ``O Viramundo,'' is densely
rhythmic, well-organized music with strong melodies and a lot of
improvisation: like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers in
their own ways, this is rock that comes close to achieving the
state of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   There is much of significance among the set's four disks of
unreleased material. They include two CDs worth of sessions that
were to go into a lost album, ``Cidade do Salvador,'' from 1974,
featuring the first-rate band Gil had assembled upon his return to
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   By this time Gil was a full-fledged experimental poet, playing
with sound-alike words to make their meanings blend and transform,
and the sound of the records indicate that he was listening to
Miles Davis' wildest studio experiments as well as to his
compatriot Milton Nascimento. ``O Viramundo,'' two disks of mostly
solo live acoustic performances that demonstrate Gil's facility at
meshing voice and guitar improvisation, is also unreleased, as is a
hippie-folk soundtrack to the 1970 film ``Copacabana Mon Amour''; a
fourth disk collects rarities from 1975 and 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The box set, which has been sold at around $250 when sighted in
this country (if record stores don't carry it, try
www.dustygroove.com) comprises only Gil's recordings for the
Philips label; it ends at 1977, when his interest in the black
diaspora was crystallizing. Many more significant albums were yet
to be recorded. But till now there has been no possibility in
America for a reasonable understanding of his work. ``Ensaio
Geral'' is a start.

VERSIONS OF EVENTS DIFFER AS TRIAL OPENS IN LOUIMA CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Note contents.) 
 (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trial of four officers accused of brutalizing a
Haitian immigrant in Brooklyn opened Tuesday with prosecutors and
defense lawyers offering graphic details of their versions of
events in a case that has inflamed racial tension in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors and spectators in a packed courtroom in federal court in
Brooklyn listened intently as the prosecutor, Kenneth P. Thompson,
described what he called the ``cruel'' and ``simply inhumane''
attack in 1997 on the immigrant, Abner Louima, whose case prompted
a series of angry marches and protests and led to a federal
investigation into possible patterns of brutality in the Police
Department. Louima is black, and the four officers accused in the
case are white.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, the prosecutor said, had been beaten in a police car by
four officers, one of whom, Thompson said, later violently shoved a
broken piece of a broomstick into Louima's rectum and then his
mouth in a police station restroom, ``literally tearing his insides
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, a defense lawyer for one of the officers suggested in his
opening statement that Louima was not the victim of police
brutality, but had suffered the injuries to his rectum and bladder
in an act of consensual sex with another man before he had come
into contact with the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will hear from a forensic pathologist and you will hear
from other medical doctors that the injuries sustained by Mr.
Louima are not, I repeat, not consistent with a nonconsensual
insertion of an object into his rectum,'' the lawyer, Marvyn M.
Kornberg, said.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg is representing Officer Justin A. Volpe, who Thompson
said in his opening statement attacked Louima with the stick.
Thompson said the officer mistakenly believed that Louima, 32, had
punched him, knocking him down, during a street brawl outside a
Brooklyn nightclub in in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But in an account not previously made public, Thompson said that
it was actually a cousin of Louima who had punched Volpe, who is
27, and that Louima and his family had lied about this to protect
the cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg responded that it was only one of several lies Louima
told as part of an effort to concoct brutality claims that could
bring him millions of dollars in a civil suit he has filed against
the city.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that his defense would include a graphic
description of consensual sex on Louima's part. Saying that traces
of Louima's feces found in the police station bathroom also
``contains the DNA of another male,'' the lawyer said, ``You are
going to be shown how somebody else's DNA can get into another
individual's feces.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has said in pretrial proceedings that its own
medical expert will testify that Louima's severe injuries _ a torn
rectum and ruptured bladder that hospitalized him for two months _
``were caused by a blunt object being forcefully inserted into his
rectum.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thompson declared Tuesday that the trial was ``about torture
_ the torture of a badly beaten and helpless man by two New York
City police officers,'' a reference to Volpe and another of the
four officers on trial on charges of violating Louima's civil
rights, Charles Schwarz, who Thompson said had held a crying Louima
down while Volpe used the stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that wasn't enough,'' Thompson said, adding that when
Volpe ``pulled out the stick, it had blood and feces on it,'' and
that the officer ``then shoved that stick in his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kornberg, the lawyers for the other defendants _ Schwarz,
Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder _ all said that the evidence would
show that their clients had not committed the crimes they are
charged with. While all four are accused of beating Louima in a
police car after his arrest in the Brooklyn street brawl, only
Volpe and Schwarz are accused of torturing him in the restroom of
the 70th Precinct station house.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is accused of trying to
cover up the alleged beating in the police car. Volpe and the
sergeant are also charged with violating the civil rights of
another Haitian immigrant, Patrick Antoine, the officer by
assaulting him in the vicinity of the nightclub and the sergeant by
joining in arresting him on false charges to conceal the beating.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Bellomo had committed none of those acts, his
lawyer, John Patten, termed his client a ``strait-laced,
no-nonsense supervisor'' and ``the type of supervisor who covers
for no one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Louima case was initially prosecuted by Brooklyn District
Attorney Charles Hynes, but he turned it over to federal
prosecutors, saying that, among other things, conviction on federal
civil rights charges could bring stiffer sentences for the officers
than conviction on state sexual abuse and assault charges. If
convicted in federal court, Volpe and Schwarz could be sentenced to
as much as life in prison.

RESEARCHERS JOIN IN EFFORT ON CLONING REPAIR TISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geron Corp., developer of human embryonic stem cells and the
cell-rejuvenating enzyme telomerase, said on Tuesday that it was
forming a $20 million research alliance with the Roslin Institute
of Scotland, cloner of Dolly the sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Geron is a leader in what has been called regenerative medicine,
the concept of repairing the body not with scalpels and harsh drugs
but with its own cells and signaling systems.
</P>
<P>
   The company's alliance with the Roslin Institute is intended to
sidestep the problem of immune rejection by cloning the patient's
own cells and deriving rejuvenated tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to science fiction scenarios of making cloned versions
of a patient to harvest as organ donors, the process envisaged by
Geron would occur at the level of individual cells grown in the
laboratory. The concept is promising research, but far from being a
practical reality.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists supported by Geron have developed embryonic stem
cells, derived from human embryos or fetuses, and these could in
principle generate every tissue of the body. But the tissues
derived from these cells would not be a perfect genetic match for
most patients and may be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other companies, like Osiris Pharmaceuticals, plan to
repair tissues with a more specialized type of stem cell, which can
be derived from the patient and would present no problem of immune
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   To get around the rejection problem, Geron's idea is to use the
central technique of animal cloning, which is to take the nucleus
of a cell from one animal and inject it into the egg of another,
whose own nucleus has been removed. The cell body, or cytoplasm, of
an egg cell seems to be able to ``reprogram'' the genes in the
inserted nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson of Dolly is that adult nuclei can be reprogrammed
by cytoplasm,'' said Dr. Thomas Okarma, Geron's vice president for
research. ``Our objective with Roslin is to learn the molecular
biology of that process so that we can confer the reprogramming
ability of cytoplasm to cells other than eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is well established that eggs can reprogram a nucleus taken
from cells of a fetus, but some biologists still doubt their
ability to reprogram adult cells, despite the widespread belief
that adult animals can be cloned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not convinced that any adult nucleus has been
reprogrammed completely enough to give a fully viable animal, and
certainly not with any efficiency,'' said Dr. Norton D. Zinder, a
Rockefeller University biologist who has taken a skeptical interest
in cloning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dolly people haven't done it again,'' Zinder said,
referring to the Roslin Institute's failure to show that the
cloning of its sheep was a repeatable scientific experiment, ``and
in the mice and cow experiments there were many deaths both before
and after birth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Okarma's scheme, an adult cell would be taken from a patient,
its nucleus removed and inserted into a recipient human cell
deprived of its own nucleus. The patient's cell nucleus would take
over the hybrid cell, creating an embryonic stem cell almost
identical to those from which the patient himself had been
generated. Although human embryonic stem cells can form every
tissue in the body, they are probably not equivalent to an embryo
because another kind of cell is required to organize the tissues
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Okarma said that the specialized stem cells obtained by
companies like Osiris could divide only a limited number of times
and that tissues generated from these cells would be already aged.
But Geron has discovered an enzyme, known as human telomerase, that
enables cells to grow and divide an unlimited number of times.
Geron hopes not only to derive any desired type of cells by the
nuclear reprogramming method, but also to rejuvenate them with
telomerase before clinical use.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists doubt the wisdom of implanting
telomerase-treated cells in the body because the division-limiting
mechanism that telomerase overrides seems to be a prime defense
against cancer.

 &HT;    Suit claims governor's office held pollution-plan records
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An environmental group sued Gov. George W. Bush
on Tuesday, charging that his office violated the state's
open-records law by withholding documents concerning its role in
shaping a policy on industrial air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in state district court by the Sustainable
Energy and Economic Development Coalition, an Austin organization
that opposes the governor's plan to encourage but not require about
800 older industrial plants to reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Bush received a disappointing but expected
warning from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on another
matter concerning air pollution. The agency, citing an inadequate
state plan to meet air-quality standards in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area, said in a letter to Bush that it would restrict the expansion
of business and industry and limit highway funding if the plan is
not improved.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for the governor, offered a cool
response to the suit: ``The governor's office has fully complied
with the law. And this is a frivolous lawsuit. And these publicity
stunts are becoming tiresome.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEED Coalition criticized Bush last week for accepting
presidential campaign contributions from supporters of voluntary
emissions reductions. In addition, several activists have been
arrested on the sidewalk and steps outside the Governor's Mansion
in recent weeks while protesting Bush's voluntary plan.
</P>
<P>
   The letter to Bush from EPA Regional Administrator Gregg Cooke
marked the first time that the federal government has threatened
sanctions against Texas under the Clean Air Act. But Edwards said
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is already
improving the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TNRCC has assured us they are working with local officials
and the EPA to develop a comprehensive plan to meet clean-air
standards,'' she said, adding that the revised plan would be filed
by March 2000, in time to avoid sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The suit accuses the governor's office of providing ``very
limited information'' concerning the policy on so-called
grandfathered plants. That is the term for plants that were
exempted from complying with newer anti-pollution rules when the
state enacted clean-air legislation in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Altman, director of the SEED Coalition, said he suspects
that the governor's office has many more records because John
Howard, natural resources and environmental director for the
office, participated in several meetings with state conservation
commission and industry officials. Altman said records obtained
from the state commission point to Howard's role. No environmental
or health groups were asked to participate in the meetings, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong is that a major public policy of critical
importance to the economy and health of Texas was developed in a
series of meetings between the governor's office and industry,''
Altman said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the office has not withheld any documents. She said
it's routine for Howard and other officials in the office to attend
meetings involving state agencies and representatives of regulated
companies. The meetings on grandfathered emissions were ``very
preliminary'' fact-finding sessions, and environmentalists had
plenty of input during subsequent public meetings, Edwards said.

 Valerie Gladstone is writing a book on the black tradition in
American dance, to be published next spring in conjunction with a
PBS series, ``Free to Dance.''  
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It didn't look like a rehearsal. On the periphery of
a spacious studio on lower Broadway, a couple of dancers stood
close together as if in conversation. Several others mingled
casually in the center.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer Bebe Miller, wearing baggy black pants and a
simple black shirt, took a position in front of the wall-length
mirror. A compact woman with dreadlocks, she faced front, then
side, then back, and front again, allowing herself to be
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Over a tape recording came her mellow voice. ``Who is looking
for gay men in the group?'' The questions are aimed at her
audiences. ``Who is counting the white people?'' ``How important is
it that these dancers work for a black choreographer?''
</P>
<P>
   The dancers remained lost in their own worlds until a gentle rap
by the Fugees started up. They then fell into loose, silky
movements. ``This section represents a party,'' Ms. Miller reminded
them. ``Don't be so serious.''
</P>
<P>
   But this 60-minute piece, ``Going to the Wall,'' which had its
premiere at Dartmouth College last year, is very serious. It will
be seen for the first time in New York on Tuesday at the Joyce
Theater, when the company begins a weeklong engagement, its first
in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the program is her new solo for herself, performed to
the live music of the three-piece Harriet Tubman Group.
</P>
<P>
   As the rehearsal progressed, the troupe's eight members picked
up the action. Frances Craig leaped into a group of men only to
find herself attacked. She screamed yet jumped back into their
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sarah Gamblin grooved with Anthony Phillips,
indifferent to the violence close at hand. Was their detachment a
metaphor for the human condition? The funky sounds rounded out into
something smoother.
</P>
<P>
   As is her custom, Ms. Miller chose several different elements
for accompaniment. With a text based on her own meditations on
life, she combined a commissioned score by the jazz clarinetist Don
Byron, song-poems by Sadiq and music by the Fugees and another
popular rap group, Nonchalant.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright Talvin Wilks acted as Ms. Miller's dramatist.
``These are dialogues in the flesh,'' her taped voice continued
during a pause in the music. ``They give hints of how we make our
way in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old Ms. Miller has explored the human condition in
dance for more than 25 years. A native New Yorker, she first took
classes as a child at the Henry Street Settlement, where the
choreographer Murray Louis introduced her to the abstract
vocabulary of his partner, Alwin Nikolais.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went smoothly until she tried ballet at 13. Feeling
out of place, she quit dance. At Ohio State University, where she
received her MA in 1975, a master class given by Merce Cunningham
lured her back. In 1985, she formed her own company. The fiery,
abstract piece ``The Hendrix Project'' (1991), to music by Jimi
Hendrix, and the poignant narrative ``Tiny Sisters'' (1994), about
two silent sisters and their secret language, indicate her range
and her depth.
</P>
<P>
   ```Going to the Wall,' deals with the question of identity and
race,'' said Ms. Miller. ``After several workshops on these issues
on tour, I learned that no matter how much you might want to, you
can't step into someone else's shoes. I had to figure out how to
arrange dancers in space to get that point across. I had to craft
that isolation and chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Her choreography relies heavily on improvisation and
collaboration. Both attracted Ms. Craig to the company six years
ago. ``Bebe ventures into new territory, using techniques more
common in theater,'' she said. ``It makes her movement very
charged, very intense. No matter where we perform this piece,
people say that by the end we are revealed, and so are they to
themselves. That's what she's after.''

   OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla._ Under clear skies, tens of thousands of
residents across two states began grappling Tuesday with the
aftermath of a series of monster tornadoes that killed at least 43
people, injured more than 500, destroyed more than 1,500 buildings
and left behind mile after mile of twisted metal, denuded trees,
crumpled cars and collapsed buildings. Standing in the anonymous
rubble of their communities, they stared, shook their heads and
joked ruefully, hoping to find some shard of their former lives
that had escaped the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce line of storms roared across Oklahoma and southern
Kansas late Monday, unleashing an unknown number of twisters
including one particularly brutal one that authorities said was at
times as wide as a mile.
</P>
<P>
   That particular tornado _ _ which some experts said might have
risen to the level of F5, the strongest classification _ gouged the
southern edge of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. It wiped more
than 200 homes over eight acres in the suburb of Moore off their
foundations like ice scraped off a windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they expected the death toll to rise.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, officials still could not determine how
widespread the damage was and how extensive the injuries, though at
least 1,500 buildings, both homes and businesses, appeared to have
been damaged or destroyed in Oklahoma on Monday night.At least 200
buildings were hit in southern Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The dead came from all across central Oklahoma, from Oklahoma
City, the suburbs of Moore, Midwest City, Del City and Norman.
Eleven of the dead came from one town, Bridge Creek, about 30 miles
southwest of the capital, near where the largest tornado hit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, five people were killed by a separate tornado that
hit Haysville, Kan., a town of 8,000 south of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   News was still straggling in from damage in small towns and
rural areas across the region while, in Oklahoma City, some 750
National Guard troops helped local officials and rescue dogs make
two, initial searches of the devastated areas around Oklahoma City
on Tuesday in a search for those who might still be trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City Fire Chief Gary Morris said Tuesday afternoon that
no one had been found in the rubble during these forays so
officials were ready to make a third and more substantial search.
``The first two searches we did were very cursory and preliminary
and we're ready to go back in with some heavy equipment and some of
the structures that are most heavily damaged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many were reminded of the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City in April 1995
that left 168 dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like eight or nine Murrah buildings scattered around
the city,'' said Congressman J.C. Watts. ``I've seen everything
from a mother in a hospital not knowing where her two sons are to a
family holding a wicker basket saying this is all we have to start
over with.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared Oklahoma a federal disaster area. A
separate declaration for parts of Kansas was also in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Oklahoma City, in particular, have suffered too
much devastation in recent years and they have been hit very, very
hard by this,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes often stay on the ground for very short periods of
time, sometimes rising into the sky and then dropping down again,
bouncing along the countryside. But the largest of Monday's
twisters, the one that ravaged south of Oklahoma City, was
reportedly on the ground for four hours. Paul G. Knight, another
Penn State meteorologist, said this was ``extraordinary,'' but that
tornadoes which stay on the ground an hour or two probably develop
at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, it goes through Farmer Joe's field,'' he
said, and so the impact is largely unappreciated. Longer-lived
tornadoes than Monday's have happened in the past. The longest, he
said, is believed to have been set by a 1925 twister that was on
the ground for seven hours, wiping out several towns in Missouri,
Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, bulldozers had begun to push into the most
devastated neighborhoods, helicopters moved overhead and the
intermittent sound of chain saws could be heard through the roar of
the wind. In those hardest hit areas, most of the houses had been
stripped of walls and roofing, not a leaf remained on the trees,
many of which were strewn with bits of metal and wood like gruesome
ornaments. At one home, shirts flapped from their hangers in a
closet that had lost its walls, and curtains waved like pennants
through yawning, glassless windows.
</P>
<P>
   Long sheets of metal, apparently roofing material, hung from the
few remaining power lines.Oddly, the lines themselves had not been
pulled down.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were being allowed into many of the hard hit areas,
though those attempting to get inside were asked to show officials
photo identification. A 6:30 p.m. curfew was put into place. In
those areas where the structures appeared most precarious,
residents were still being kept out Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Kathi R. Ferguson, 38, collapsed against her mother as she
looked at the wreckage of her Moore home. ``I spent most of my life
in that house,'' she said through sobs. Ferguson had rushed from
her home in Tulsa to find her parents and see what had become of
the brick house where she had lived for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't collapse, it blew away,'' said Clifford L. Dodson,
73, her father, a retired FAA technician.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dodson's sons-in-law, Brent K. Mackay, 34, tried to clear
rubble from what had been the front door. He lives nearby, but
authorities had not allowed him to go to his home, which was also
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's storm started in southwestern Oklahoma near the town of
Lawton, said Paul Janish, a meteorologist with the National Storm
Prediction Center. The storm rapidly became severe and produced a
string of several, short-lived tornadoes. The storm grew as it
moved northeast at about 30 mph, eventually producing larger
tornadoes as it approached Oklahoma City, Janish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around 7 p.m. the storm intensified into a large super cell
storm and produced a very large, violent tornado,'' he said. The
tornado touched down north of Chickasha, 26 miles northeast of the
capital, and stayed on the ground until it reached Tinker Air Force
Base, just east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The storm system moved across southern Oklahoma City, through
the town of Moore and continued northeast until it wiped out a
factory outlet mall near the town of Stroud, between Oklahoma City
and Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   The storm produced tornadoes for over a 100-mile track, Janish
said. ``It wasn't a continuous tornado, but during the entire path
was producing tornadoes almost continuously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This was all ``very extraordinary,'' Janish said, because
``typically what happens when we get a thunderstorm that produces a
tornado, the tornado will go through its life cycle and weaken in a
short period of time and then the storm may produce another.''
</P>
<P>
   But this particular twister had an unusually long life cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average life span of any given tornado is probably less
than 10 minutes,'' Janish said. ``This tornado not only unusually
large and long lived but unusually destructive in its wind speeds.
It's definitely one of the longer track tornadoes you'll ever
see.''
</P>
<P>
   The tornado was mainly at a level of F4, with winds speeds
between 207 and 260 mph. At that intensity houses are leveled or
blown off their foundations and cars can be thrown, Janish said. At
F5, winds speeds are as high as 318 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that even though these tornadoes apparently ranked
among the most powerful of their breed, there was nothing out of
the ordinary about them, meteorologically speaking. ``It's spring,
it's Oklahoma, and tornadoes and even strong tornadoes are not
unusual,'' said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist with the
Pennsylvania State University Weather Communications Group.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes materialize within large thunderstorms, which in this
case were produced by a clash of cold air from the west with warm,
moist air to the east. They often appear on the southern Great
Plains in the spring, in an area of Oklahoma and Kansas nicknamed
Tornado Alley.
</P>
<P>
   What made Monday's disaster unusual, Gadomski said, was that
``by the luck of the draw, the tornadoes went through a relatively
heavily populated neck of the woods.'' The chances that one of the
most powerful class of tornado ``will go over any individual spot
in a person's lifetime is on the order of one in 10 million,'' he
said, ``even in Tornado Alley.''

<P>
   A tornado outbreak in Florida last year led to 42 deaths, while
90 people were killed by tornadoes associated with a 1985 storm in
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Ontario and more than 300 were killed by
what meteorologists call a ``super outbreak'' of some 118 tornadoes
during a two-day storm in April 1974 over 11 midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Marty and Vernoia Bernich survived Monday's storm with their two
daughters at their brick-and-frame home in the Highland Park
neighborhood on the south side of Moore. ``We huddled in a hallway
under a mattress,'' Bernich said. ``We could feel ourselves
elevated, you know, like up to the sky. We could hear things
smashing around us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, Bernich surveyed what was left of his
house. ``There's nothing left,'' he said. An art educator and
potter, Bernich stood amid shards of his work that littered what
was left of his living room while, eerily, several of his other
pots still sat on shelves, inches away, upright and untouched.
</P>
<P>
   He was angry that state officials were not allowing him to bring
more vehicles into the area to cart away more of his damaged goods.
``I just need a little empathy,'' he said to one official, barely
holding back his anger. ``My home has been put in a blender and
we're being treated like Kosovo refugees. Just allow us to take
whatever is left.''
</P>
<P>
   But government officials, worried about a traffic jam in the
debris-clogged streets, were keeping vehicles to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy L. Staggs, 35, a forklift operator, was trying to maneuver
a truck load of recovered household goods from the wreckage of the
three-bedroom home she shared not far from the Berniches with
Michele D. Moore, 34. It was like threading a needle as the truck
squeezed between piles of metal, sheet rock and brick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just moved in two weeks ago,'' said Moore, a machinist in
Norman. ``That's all you can do, just start over. We had just put
in new wallpaper, just settled in, when this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore had been away when Monday's storm him, but Staggs was
there, huddled beneath a mattress in a central hallway with their
two dogs. ``You take for granted that it won't happen to you,''
Staggs said. ``I've never seen anything like this, except for on
TV. We're shook up and bruised up, but we're fine.'' Including the
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In Moore, where the twister cut a three-mile long swath at least
five to six blocks wide through the city, assistant fire chief
Terry Schatt said officials were still assessing the damage though
at least one victim was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pretty much demolished everything along its path through
here and we're still not sure what we're going to find when we
bring in the heavy equipment,'' he said. ``There may be more bodies
or we may have gotten them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakeside Golf Course in Moore, which was renovated last
year, was a wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Joe O'Bryant, 60, the superintendent there, said that he had
been watching television news about the coming storm in his trailer
by the side of the course when he decided to head for a sturdier
building. He got to the clubhouse just in time to see the half-mile
wide tornado cross the highway that abuts the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see trees in it, flying around,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   He ran into the restroom, and felt the walls collapse around
him. He was pinned beneath a crumbled wall, hugging a bar stool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about 45 minutes to dig me out,'' said O'Bryant.
``When I got out I was shocked. I thought that maybe the roof had
collapsed. But the whole building was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The clubhouse was reduced to a pile of loose cinder blocks,
splintered bits of wood, scores of mangled irons and muddy balls
and twisted wrecks of green golf carts piled on top of each other.
The only trace of O'Bryant's trailer was a muddy plot of land where
it had once stood. Bits of the chassis were found 500 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   In the 400-home Highland Park neighborhood, evidence of the
storm's destructive power stretched as far as the eye could see:
block after block of destroyed houses and smashed automobiles;
mounds of splintered lumber and twisted wiring; toppled signs
uprooted from their concrete bases; trees stripped of leaves and
bark.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Bennett, an Assembly of God pastor from a nearby
community, stood at an intersection in Highland Park and offered
counseling to residents leaving the neighborhood. ``We've got a
hundred families in there that are survivors, but they're just not
ready to come out. They want to stay with their homes and see what
they can save,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dazed residents picked through unrecognizable stacks of debris,
searching for familiar objects or valuables. One woman sat on the
steps of her front porch _ almost all that remained of her house _
and hugged a barking German shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks more like a bombing than a storm,'' said Billie Sue
Rhodes, 69, as she plucked a framed photograph from a pile of
wreckage. Rhodes and her husband, Thurman, 73, were at home when
the tornado struck and took refuge together in a closet. It is the
only part of the house still standing. At one point during the
storm, Rhodes had left the closet to retrieve his glasses and the
wind threatened to carry him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't get back inside to the closet and if she
hadn't grabbed me and hung on till the wind laid down, I wouldn't
be here. She's a real hero to me, but I guess she has been for 49
years,'' said Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who said he has suffered three recent strokes, said the
couple had lost everything in the storm and would probably have to
move into an assisted living facility. As he rested against an
overturned television cabinet in what once was his living room,
Rhodes reflected on the results of the last 24 hours: ``Liked to
have kept the house, but the storm took care of that; would have
liked to have kept the car, but I don't really need it. At least
we've still got each other,'' he said.  &QL;

AN UNHURRIED JOURNEY TO THE TOP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of musicians these days are already starting international
careers before they have completed the early stages of professional
development, so that they find themselves putting their clothes on
in public.
</P>
<P>
   Into such a world suddenly comes Robert McDuffie, a violinist
fully and impeccably dressed, ready to make his New York
Philharmonic debut on Thursday evening at Avery Fisher Hall after
nearly two decades of giving concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Experience tells. McDuffie, at 40, is a musician with his own
voice: not just the engaging, cozy drawl that has been with him
since his early days in Macon, Ga., but the fine sound he makes
with his instrument.
</P>
<P>
   In that sound you seem to meet the man: his charm, his courtesy,
his openness and enthusiasm with regard to people and to life. It
is a singing sound, sweet or airy but always vividly present, and
always with beautiful intonation.
</P>
<P>
   It is, he says, impossible for string players always to play in
tune. The important thing is to seem to: to make the imprecision
work. ``One thing I learned from Dorothy DeLay at the Juilliard
School,'' he explained, ``is the difference between expressive
intonation and out-of-tune playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of the things that please him most now _ a mark of his
modesty _ is when he gets congratulated on his intonation by a
fellow musician among the players in an orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Miss DeLay looks back with affection on the lessons she gave
him. ``I liked him enormously,'' she said. ``He was obviously very
gifted, and he had a tremendous sense of humor.'' She has also
followed his career, hearing him two or three times a year in New
York, where he now lives, or at the Aspen Music Festival in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   She is not surprised by the success he is having now or by its
slow arrival. ``An awful lot depends on how managements decide to
handle a young person,'' she said, ``whether to push them forward
at once, or allow them to do a lot of concerts at a level of more
comfort, which gives them a chance to develop. Robert, I find, is
developing all the time. Every time I hear him, he's better. He's
grown. The interpretation has more depth, more ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does McDuffie himself seem bothered by having had a long
apprenticeship. ``I was having a wonderful time, traveling,
learning great music,'' he said. ``I kind of knew it was going to
happen some day.''
</P>
<P>
   Time out of the limelight gave him an opportunity to explore the
repertory, and to establish preferences and loves that are
reflected in the recordings he has recently been making for Telarc.
He is superb in the lyrical concertos of Mendelssohn and Bruch. He
plays Viennese schmaltz with huge appeal. And he makes a strong
case for American music of widely different kinds, across the
spectrum from the craggy to the blithe.
</P>
<P>
   He will be at the blithe end with the Philharmonic this week,
for the work is Lou Harrison's Suite for Violin, Piano and Small
Orchestra, of 1951, with Christopher Taylor as pianist and Franz
Welser-Most conducting. But his recital repertory includes Elliott
Carter's ``Riconoscenza,'' and he has recorded the concertos of
Samuel Barber, John Adams and Philip Glass.
</P>
<P>
   His first recording was of Leonard Bernstein's ``Serenade'' and
William Schuman's Concerto: a lonely release from more than 10
years ago, when both composers were alive to be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy meeting the composer and having an exchange of
ideas,'' McDuffie said. ``There's more freedom than when you're
performing ultra-familiar music. You can bring more to the piece.
And I think that playing these modern works has made me play
Mendelssohn better.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie's next recording project is a disk of music by Miklos
Rozsa, including the Concerto and the Theme and Variations for
Violin, Cello and Orchestra, with Lynn Harrell as cellist, and Yoel
Levi conducting the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. This music takes
him back to his childhood; the teacher whom his mother, herself an
active musician, found for him in Macon was a Hungarian, Henrik
Schwarzenberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I came back from my first music camp, at the
age of 12 or 13, and Schwarzenberger wanted to see what they'd
written about me,'' McDuffie said. `` `Plays like a Gypsy,' he read
out. `I don't know whether that's good or bad.''' (The answer is,
good _ if the Gypsy forwardness comes with McDuffie's style of
tonal perfection.)
</P>
<P>
   A year or two later, Itzhak Perlman visited Macon, and though
the young McDuffie had to be dragged away from a basketball game to
the recital, when he got back home, he instantly started
practicing. Another couple of years after that, at 16, he was ready
to attend the Juilliard precollege division. And there, hearing a
student play the Sibelius Concerto, he recognized what he wanted
his life to be.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has it. Or at least, he is embarked on it, for he shows
no sign of self-satisfaction, and the best may be yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   He tries to speak honestly, without false modesty, of the
experience he had performing and recording Adams' Concerto in
Houston with Christoph Eschenbach, a conductor with whom he loves
to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a kid in a candy store,'' McDuffie said, ``adoring
his job and willing to learn from anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Then quietly comes the memory of what he began to sense in
himself: ``Playing the Adams, I felt for the first time that I was
flirting with greatness. I felt that I could, in a benign and
musical way, manipulate everyone around me: the orchestra and the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Given McDuffie's character, that moment will act as a spur. And
given his musicianship, there will be many more of them.

   LEVITT OF SEC CRITICIZES ADS FOR ONLINE INVESTING
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, criticized brokerage industry advertisements focusing
on the get-rich aspect of on-line investing, contending they were
doing more harm than good for both Wall Street and the public.
Levitt also admonished individual investors to better educate
themselves about on-line trading. But he called on brokerage firms
to strengthen their disclosure of the risks of trading stocks over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   TREASURY BOND PRICES DROP SHARPLY
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices dropped sharply, pushing long-term interest rates to
their highest level in nine months. The yield of the benchmark
30-year Treasury jumped to 5.71 percent. Investors are losing the
conviction that the United States economy will slow this year, with
inflation remaining in check; instead, a growing number worry that
a rebound in the rest of the world will keep growth strong here and
nudge inflation higher.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS FALL; DOW DOWN 129 POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks tumbled, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down
128.58 points, or 1.17 percent, to 10,886.11. The Nasdaq composite
index fell 50.46 points, or 2 percent, to 2,485.12. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index declined 22.63 points, or 1.7 percent, to
1,332.00.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Goldman Sachs Group, Wall Street's last big private
partnership, soared on their first day of trading, rising $17.375,

</P>
<P>
   HIGHER GASOLINE PRICES FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the key summer driving season, gasoline prices are
up sharply from historically low levels, a result of cuts by major
oil producing countries. Now, citing tight American supplies of
gasoline, experts foresee still higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   CBS PUTS PRESSURE ON MORNING TV
</P>
<P>
   CBS's decision to bring Bryant Gumbel back to morning television
raises the ante in the competition among network morning programs,
an area gaining more attention from network executives because it
offers far more potential for increased profits than prime time or
any other hour of the day. With Gumbel, a new program and new
studio, to be built in one of the most visible sites in Manhattan,
CBS is making a commitment to compete head to head with NBC's
``Today'' show, by far the dominant show in the morning with Katie
Couric and Matt Lauer.

 &HT;    Nashville expected to land Dell campus
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. is expected to announce on
Thursday that Nashville, Tenn., will be the home of a major
regional campus for sales, service and computer assembly and its
first U.S. expansion outside the Austin area.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement in Tennessee's State Capitol will end weeks of
intense competition and speculation in the Nashville area over
which of several sites in two or three counties will get the boost
in sales and property taxes and bragging rights for thousands of
jobs. Dell disclosed April 1 that it had chosen the Nashville area
for the expansion but had not settled on a specific site.
</P>
<P>
   Dell spokesman Peter Scacco declined Tuesday to confirm that
Nashville and Davidson County had beaten out Rutherford and other
nearby counties. But a news conference advisory sent to area news
media said Nashville Mayor Phil Bredesen will join Gov. Don
Sundquist and Dell officials for the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Vice Chairman Kevin Rollins is expected to make the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our fervent prayer,'' said Mark Drury, Bredesen's press
secretary, when asked whether Nashville landed Dell and an
estimated 3,000 jobs within five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conceivable, if Dell maintains the growth rate it has
experienced, that we could be looking at 10,000 jobs in several
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell employs nearly 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's imminent arrival in central Tennessee touched off intense
local speculation about the site and incentives that the competing
cities and counties were offering the Round Rock-based company. Two
weeks ago, historical preservationists urged Dell not to build on
private land in Rutherford County, where a Civil War battle was
fought in December 1862.
</P>
<P>
   Dell did not confirm that the site was a serious contender. But
until then, many in the Nashville area assumed Rutherford County
was leading the charge for Dell's facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, Bredesen said he and Dell reached an
informal agreement to locate the expansion in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Bredesen also said that in addition to property-tax breaks and
free land, Nashville hoped to give Dell some of the sales taxes the
company collected on Tennessee PC sales, which is similar to a deal
that Round Rock lured Dell with in 1993. But a state official tried
to quash that speculation, noting that sharing sales tax with
private companies is illegal in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Scacco said Tuesday that public discussion in Tennessee about
incentives has been ``highly speculative'' and ``not necessarily
what Dell has been requesting.''
</P>

Texas.

HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WORKERS DEAL WITH THE CARNAGE FROM DEVASTATING
STORM

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDWEST CITY, Okla. _ The first three tornado victims to arrive
at Midwest Regional Medical Center Monday afternoon were siblings,
all younger than 5. They were all in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Owen, a physician's assistant, jumped into action. One
child had an open skull fracture. Another was bleeding from a head
injury. The third had a piece of plywood lodged in his back, less
than an inch from his spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I heard this voice say, `Bret, save my babies,''' Owen
recalled, choking back tears. ``I looked up and it was a man from
my church. I've worked on his children several times before. ...
They weren't recognizable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Owen, like other hospital employees across the greater
Oklahoma City area, had to push aside personal feelings and keep
working.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more were arriving for medical help.
</P>
<P>
   Some would be their neighbors. Some were friends. A nurse,
working around the clock, had a 4-month-old niece killed in the
tornado's path and another relative injured and admitted to the
hospital. The nurse didn't learn the news until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Many had no clue how their own families fared in the deadly
storm. As many as 14 Midwest Regional workers were left homeless _
their homes gobbled up in the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You totally wipe all of those thoughts from your mind and you
worry about the here and now,'' said Rosemarie Shepherd, head
emergency room nurse. ``We see the horror first-hand. ... You've
just got to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   As the storm passed Monday, 110 victims made it Midwest
Regional. Many found their own way because paramedics were unable
to reach them. Others managed to wave down help from passing
emergency officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 30 minutes we were almost overwhelmed,'' said Dr. Dan
Donnell, medical director of the emergency department. ``Then it
became a matter of deciding which patient needed to go to the
emergency room first.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Hefton, a hospital spokeswoman, said that as of 4 p.m.
Tuesday, the hospital treated 114 tornado victims. Twenty-one were
admitted. Four remained in critical condition and three were listed
as serious.
</P>
<P>
   Across the state, 541 victims were treated at hospitals by
midafternoon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Donnell said one person he was working on died on the operating
table. Another man died before he could get to surgery, his leg
severed and a piece of wood wedged deep into his head.
</P>
<P>
   He said the toughest part of his job is assessing each case and
deciding ``who's salvageable and who isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people looked like someone had a sandblaster
held in front of them,'' Donnell said. ``Almost everyone I saw had
foreign bodies embedded. Some of them had their clothes blown off
them and their underwear shredded.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the hospital got so crowded that ambulances were
diverted.
</P>
<P>
   Donnell said Monday's catastrophe was worse than the Oklahoma
City bombing four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for 20 years and to me this is worst than
the bombing,'' Donnell said. ``It affects more people I know and
entire communities. The recovering is going to take much longer.''

   DEL CITY, Okla. _ Shelter workers had mattresses spread on the
lobby floor and in the fellowship hall at First Southern Baptist
Church, but frayed nerves kept the two men from sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Left homeless by Monday's storm, the men declined food and
coffee, too. Almost anything beyond conversation seemed frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ruhman and Dan Tillotson lived around the corner from each
other in a subdivision in southeast Oklahoma City called Frolich
Meadows. They didn't know each other beyond an occasional
``Howdy.''
</P>
<P>
   A tornado buried each man in his home in a blitz of shattering
glass, ricocheting bricks and collapsing shingles. At the shelter,
they felt the need to stick close to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Like many left without shelter, Ruhman and Tillotson took refuge
at the church. They speculated on what they would find when they
returned to Frolich Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going back to try to dig out, try to find my money,'' said
Ruhman, 71, a professional bowler who has maintained his athletic
physique even though he now limits himself to seniors competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen my dune buggy, and I know my dachshund was all
right because I saw him when it first happened _ but when I went
back, he was gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tillotson nodded in agreement in the reddish-glow of oil lamps
and candles used by the shelter, which hadn't enough generators for
electric light. Flashlights popped off and on as nurses recorded
blood pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Digging out valuables was too strenuous a goal for Tillotson.
Just finding his medicine would be enough. Although he said he
feels strong for 74, the 30 staples in his knee from the
replacement surgery he had three weeks ago have slowed him. He was
also tired. His next-door neighbors, the LeClaires, had dug him out
from his collapsed roof Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Their hopes Tuesday of getting to the houses quickly dimmed
early in the day when a torrential downpour opened from a sky so
black it seemed more like 10 in the evening than 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, everything that wasn't ruined will be soaked,'' Ruhman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sun began to peer out mercifully about noon, and Ruhman and
Tillotson bummed a ride, grateful to get away from the bustling
shelter for a while. National Guardsmen turned them away at seven
checkpoints before they found a sympathetic one who allowed them
into the cordoned area the police had set up for the most damaged
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The devastation in the midday sun looked worse than they
expected. Ruhman arrived to see his neighbor across the street,
Jake Self, removed in a body bag. Ruhman had tried to dig Self out
Monday night, but was unable to reach him.
</P>
<P>
   Some houses on Tillotson's street still had partial walls
intact. On Ruhman's street, it looked as if nothing but a scrap
yard had ever been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? I was just ready to apply for a home
improvement loan on that house,'' Tillotson said. He mentioned the
loan several times as if it were the timing of the tragedy that was
annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Tillotson recruited neighbors to help get his medicine and his
briefcase and decided to return to the shelter. There was nothing
left to claim.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhman, on the other hand, declared he would work long into the
night. He wanted to clear up the mess and to be there when _ if _
his dog came home. nn

U.S. CALLED CLOSER TO GAINING RUSSIAN SUPPORT ON KOSOVO PLAN

 By JANE PERLEZ

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials said Tuesday that
they believe they have persuaded the Russian envoy to the Balkans
that a military force, rather than just a monitoring mission, would
be needed in Kosovo after the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The White House outlined some details of the talks that the
envoy, Victor Chernomyrdin, held Monday with President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore. Chernomyrdin continued his diplomatic
efforts Tuesday at the United Nations, where he met with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   While the officials stressed that Chernomyrdin had not formally
accepted the idea of a military force in Kosovo, they said he
seemed to understand that an armed contingent was necessary to
allow the return of more than 600,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees. The
Russians have always agreed with the United States that the
refugees should return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   During the more than five hours of talks, Chernomyrdin was also
told that an international force, with NATO at its core, would be
the most forceful way to prevent a potential civil conflict between
the returning armed refugees and remnants of Yugoslav forces, the
officials said. NATO leaders have worried that without military
protection, clashes between Albanian rebels and the Yugoslav
military could erupt into a civil war that would imperil the masses
of returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   By the conclusion of the talks, which ended around the dining
room table at Gore's residence Tuesday morning, Chernomyrdin was
discussing the possibility of a military force. One official who
was briefed on the discussions said this was taken as a
``significant'' step.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, after meeting with Annan in New York,
Chernomyrdin spoke more positively than he has in the past about an
international security force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it would be paramilitary, military or civil forces _
of course it's subject to negotiations,'' he said. ``There must be
political will, both in Belgrade and NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the discussions at such a high level _ 90
minutes with Clinton, followed by lengthier discussions with Gore _
signaled a commitment by the White House to push aggressively for a
way to get the United States out of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the Senate dodged a vote on NATO's battle in
the Balkans by voting 78-22 on Tuesday to kill a measure pushing
Clinton to escalate the war. The resolution's sponsor, Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., is running for president and all but called
Clinton a coward from the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States is prepared to lose a war
rather than to do the hard work, the politically risky work, of
fighting it as the leader of the greatest nation on earth should
fight when our interests and values are imperiled,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly ruled out the use of ground troops, and
in recent weeks has wooed the Russians to be the primary
intermediary for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As the president left late Tuesday afternoon for a visit to NATO
headquarters in Brussels and then U.S. troops in Germany, he
emphasized the importance of diplomacy and Chernomyrdin's efforts
in ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reaffirmed our support for his efforts and our willingness
to seize every diplomatic possibility for Serbian authorities to
meet the requirements that NATO has articulated,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president added that an international security force with
NATO would give an incentive to the Albanian guerrillas in the
Kosovo Liberation Army to disarm and would also help protect Serbs,
who make up a minority of the Kosovo population. Both these points
have special appeal to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials who were briefed on Chernomyrdin's
comments in the meetings with Gore, said that the Russian envoy
insisted that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had become more
flexible on the question of withdrawal of his forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO now estimates that the Yugoslav forces number about 40,000
in Kosovo, and the Yugoslav leader is talking about reducing his
forces there to 1998 levels, the officials said Chernomyrdin told
them. But that reduction _ interpreted by the administration to
mean maintaining a Yugoslav force of 20,000 troops _ would be
totally unacceptable to NATO, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo was a main element
of a sequence of events that the White House told Chernomyrdin must
occur for the conflict to end, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration still wants Milosevic to begin the drawdown
of his forces in Kosovo and make a commitment to a complete
withdrawal before NATO would suspend its bombing campaign, the
officials said. But bombing would resume, the officials warned
Chernomyrdin, if the commitment to withdraw the Yugoslav forces was
not kept, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the forces had withdrawn, an international security force _
still described as one with NATO troops at the core _ would
``quickly'' enter Kosovo. ``This has to happen before the refugees
come in,'' the official said the Russian was told.
</P>
<P>
   This sequence _ Serbian forces out and international force in _
was essential in order to prevent a ``worst case'' scenario of
armed Albanian refugees and their guerrilla supporters returning to
Kosovo while Serbian forces were still there.
</P>
<P>
   They would certainly fight each other, meaning that a light
peacekeeping force, the type suggested by Milosevic, would be
caught in the middle, Chernomyrdin was told, the official said.

 &HT;    Prayer celebration volunteer hitting high notes
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At 10 p.m., Evelyn Davison of Leander _ a
mother, grandmother and prayer parent _ took to the lectern on the
West Mall at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, God created heaven and Earth,'' she began,
kicking off the Bible reading marathon that began Sunday as part of
the National Day of Prayer celebration.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 readers, working in shifts, are participating in
the event at UT. They expect to finish by 7 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second year the Bible-reading marathon has ushered in
the National Day of Prayer, recognized by federal law on the first
Thursday in May.
</P>
<P>
   For 13 years, Davison has volunteered to be the Central Texas
coordinator for the annual prayer day. It's no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will probably be 300 events in the Austin area,'' she
said. ``It's to call people of faith to prayer that they might pray
in a matter that's comfortable for them for our nation and our
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Davison prays for one leader every day: Gov. George W. Bush. The
first year Bush was in office, she adopted him as part of a prayer
day program that matches regular folks with politicians.
</P>
<P>
   As his prayer parent, her job is to keep an eye on the potential
presidential candidate, making sure he stays in line with biblical
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to pray for him faithfully and when he is in
error, according to the will of God ... to tell him,'' Davison
said. ``I just write and talk to one of his aides.''
</P>
<P>
   She usually pens words of encouragement; only once has she
criticized the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever seen his picture when he runs in the Capitol
10,000? Those shorts he wears are awful,'' Davison said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush said: ``I believe in the power of prayer and
I appreciate those, including Evelyn Davison, who celebrate the
importance of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, after the prayer breakfast that this Thursday morning
will be in Austin's City Coliseum, Davison and local religious
leaders meet with the governor. She usually brings him an
inspirational book and a National Day of Prayer shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Davison said she never dreamed, initially, that the man she was
praying for might run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he had those aspirations,'' she said. ``I just
pray he will do what he says he will do and what is best for his
family and what's best for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Davison is a familiar face in Christian circles. She is the
publisher and primary owner of the Good News Journal, a monthly
tabloid newspaper that offers inspiration and encouragement to
families. Each Saturday at noon, she hosts the show ``Love Walk''
on gospel station KFIT 1060 AM.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be around Evelyn long without understanding the
profound impact that she has on the Austin community through her
personal prayer life,'' said Greg Davidson, Bush's deputy
legislative director. ``She lives her life as she proclaims it,
daily in prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said it was prayer that brought the two of them
together. He was wondering why there wasn't a prayer day event at
the Capitol, and she was praying that someone would step forward to
coordinate one.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson called the prayer day information number. ``Little did
I know that my call was an answer to her prayer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another of her qualities, Davidson said, is how how much she can
accomplish in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is definitely focused and has a great ability to get a lot
of things done simultaneously,'' said Amy Budwit, who coordinated
the Bible reading marathon. ``I just respect the fact she has so
much energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Budwit, a process engineer at Samsung, launched the Bible
reading concept last year. Bible reading marathons have sprung up
across the nation ever since President George Bush's 1990
proclamation that named this the decade of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Davison, who spent late hours reading the Bible at UT, said it
is important for students to hear God's word, even at unusual
hours. ``Probably the biggest crowds we have are at 2 o'clock in
the morning,'' she said.

INTERNATIONAL MONITORING OF YUGOSLAVIA'S ENRICHED URANIUM TO
RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ International nuclear inspectors have decided
to return to Yugoslavia to inspect the nuclear reactor at Vinca and
to insure that all its highly enriched uranium is still in place,
inspectors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   David Kyd, a spokesman for the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency, said the agency had decided to return despite the
danger after receiving a letter from the government in Belgrade on
April 26 urging a resumption of inspections ``as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they expect an inspection to take place in
the middle of May. The officials and nuclear experts previously
expressed concern that Yugoslavia, if pushed to the wall, might
seize the fissionable material to embark on a nuclear weapons
program, sell it to a rogue state or terrorist group or use it as a
bargaining chip.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter, Yugoslavia said an inspection would be useful in
allaying such concerns and convincing skeptics ``that the nuclear
materials are in the same condition, in the same place, and in
unchanged quantities.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes as Russia has privately expressed concern
about the risk to the region if the Vinca Institute of Nuclear
Science, less than 30 miles from Belgrade, were bombed by NATO,
whether intentionally or by mistake. Russia raised the issue in a
letter last week from Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov
to U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, said Clinton
administration officials. An official said that Richardson was
still drafting a response. A senior administration official said
that the United States welcomed the agency's decision to return to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and
International Security, an arms control research group in
Washington, said that whatever the inspection's outcome, ``the IAEA
has established an important precedent: verifying the peaceful use
of nuclear material is important enough to the international
community to justify the risk that such a mission entails.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency has not conducted its usual monthly inspections since
late January. Kyd said that the agency was planning to send two
inspectors into Yugoslavia as soon as safe passage could be
assured.
</P>
<P>
   IAEA officials previously said there was no evidence that
Yugoslavia was preparing to abandon its longstanding renunciation
of nuclear weapons. Nor were there signs, they said, that elements
within the military were diverting the uranium at Vinca or taking
other steps that would suggest an intention to use the material to
develop a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said there was enough material at Vinca to make two
nuclear weapons of an implosion-type design, which Iraq is said to
be pursuing, or one bomb of a ``gun type'' design, which South
Africa had made. The large nuclear reactor at Vinca has been closed
since 1984, he said. A smaller research reactor was operating at
least until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Most officials and nuclear experts have been more concerned
about Vinca's inadequate protection and its relatively poor history
of handling radioactive material. Albright said that although the
IAEA had improved security at the facility several years ago and
Russia had helped Vinca improve its handling of the nuclear waste
produced by its nuclear reactors, there were still safety concerns
about the 5,000 spent fuel rods that are stored in some 30 aluminum
casks in a pool of water.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials have said that Vinca is not on
the list of NATO targets, there is growing concern about potential
damage to the people of the surrounding area and the environment if
it were hit by accident.

BEARING LOTUS BLOSSOMS AND HOPE, NOT GUNS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (af) 
 Laura Winters' most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the director Wes Anderson  
 By LAURA WINTERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 2, Tony Bui escaped Vietnam with his family after the
1975 fall of Saigon. Growing up in Sunnyvale, Calif., as one of the
few Vietnamese in his community, he was intent on assimilation.
``My brother and sister and I didn't spend much time trying to
learn our culture,'' Bui said. ``Vietnam, to me, was a past-tense
word.''
</P>
<P>
   His father had been an officer in the South Vietnamese Air
Force; his mother came from a family of Vietnamese artists. On his
first trip back to his birthplace, Bui (pronounced like buoy), then
19, stayed with his uncle, one of the country's best-known film
actors. He hated the heat and the lack of amenities, but when he
came home he sank into a depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't understand this deep longing,'' he said during a
recent trip to New York, at the Algonquin Hotel. ``Everything I
thought about took me back to Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   On school breaks from his studies at Loyola Marymount University
in Los Angeles, Bui made several trips to Vietnam. What he saw
there was radically different from the images he had seen in
American films, which showed a country of ``people running around
in the jungle, guns in their hands,'' as he described it.
</P>
<P>
   Bui's visits led to his first short film, ``Yellow Lotus,'' and
then to ``Three Seasons,'' which opened in New York on April 30 and
nationwide on Friday. It is the first American feature film to
attempt a portrait of contemporary postwar Vietnam, poised on the
brink of modernity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Seasons,'' which landed a major American star, Harvey
Keitel (who has been known to be partial to small, independent
films), is an interweaving of three stories and operates on several
narrative levels: past and present, personal and national,
realistic and poetic.
</P>
<P>
   The characters (``people who are all trying to find something,''
Bui says) are caught in the clash between old and new within Ho Chi
Minh City. One story is about a young lotus-blossom picker and the
ailing, reclusive poet she works for. Another is about a cyclo
(rickshaw) driver's love for a young prostitute. The third is about
an encounter between a street urchin and an American ex-marine who
is searching for the daughter he left behind. That is the closest
the film comes to a war-related story line.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing his desire to debunk cliches about Vietnam, Bui, who
is 26 and wears his long black hair in a ponytail, is serious and
soft-spoken. ``The Vietnam that I saw is a country where more than
half of the population wasn't born yet when the war ended,'' he
says. ``I saw people filled with hopes and ambitions and
frustrations. But their entire attitude is about moving forward and
reaching out. I wanted to show this humanity, this side which no
one knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the film won three awards at the Sundance Film
Festival, including the grand jury prize for best dramatic feature.
Even critics who have found it sentimental have praised its visual
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Bui's choice of a lyrical tone is intentional, however, as is
his adoption of a poetic, rather than a political, approach. His
film carves out its own territory alongside other film treatments
of Vietnam: American views of the war, films of the
French-Vietnamese artist Tran Anh Hung, and the melodramatic
tradition of film within Vietnam itself.
</P>
<P>
   At the time that Bui shot ``Yellow Lotus,'' only a few French
productions (``The Lover,'' ``Indochine'') had filmed in Vietnam.
The crop of American films about the war had all been shot
elsewhere. But by 1995, with the establishment of diplomatic
relations with Vietnam, filming there became possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bui's entree to shoot in Vietnam came about through an
accidental meeting between his mother, Susie Truong Bui, and the
head of the Giai Phong Film Studio, one of Vietnam's two largest
state-run film companies. He also had a trump card in that his
uncle the actor Don Duong agreed to star in both ``Yellow Lotus''
and ``Three Seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bui attended the Sundance Filmmakers and Screenwriters Lab
in 1996, he had four goals for the feature he was planning. ``One,
to shoot entirely in Vietnam,'' he said. ``Two, to use Vietnamese
actors. Three, to have real Vietnamese dialogue. Four, to have the
film not be about the war or politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``Three Seasons'' are all based on people and
situations that Bui had seen during his trips to Ho Chi Minh City
(still called Saigon locally and in the film).
</P>
<P>
   The characters' stories captivated Jason Kliot and Joana
Vicente, of the New York production company Open City Films, who
met Bui at the Sundance Independent Producers Conference and who
signed on as his producers. They eventually persuaded October Films
to finance the project and Keitel to play the former marine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read Tony's script I was aware _ not unlike when I read
`Reservoir Dogs' _ of a voice I hadn't heard before,`` Keitel said
in a telephone interview from Italy, where he is shooting a new
film. ``It's a poetic and touching voice. Once upon a time, our
politicians visited Vietnam and there was a war. But this young man
is talking about the internal war that we all wage with ourselves:
trying to find a life, a love, to take care of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shooting in Vietnam, with its lack of basic supplies, was a
challenge, especially on a budget of only $2 million or so. Perhaps
the most delicate situation, however, was the relationship between
the filmmakers and the censors.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese practice requires that a censor be on the set
throughout the shoot, and if he objects to something political or
sexual or even symbolic, the issue has to be discussed until both
sides reach a resolution or compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Communist government allowed a film to be made
that touched on sensitive issues like prostitution and destitute
street children. It no doubt helps that ``Three Seasons'' is
resolutely nonpolitical in nature and celebrates the spirit of the
Vietnamese people rather than taking a critical stance.
</P>
<P>
   When Bui showed the film to a group of government officials and
artists after completion, the response was positive, he said, and
he is hopeful that the film will be approved for showing in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of Vietnamese films are made each year, mostly
because of a lack of financing. But there is a Vietnamese film
industry, and it has some noted directors, like Dang Nhat Minh,
whose films (including ``When the 10th Month Comes'' and
``Nostalgia for Countryland'') have been presented in the United
States by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Gilmore, co-director of the Sundance Film Festival,
believes that critics who call ``Three Seasons'' sentimental are
judging the film too much through Western eyes. ```Three Seasons''
is a kind of filmmaking which comes out of a poetic expressiveness
true to Vietnam,'' he said. ``There's a quality in Thai and
Vietnamese dramatic productions that we would view as excessively
sentimental but that they would view as traditional. It's a certain
kind of melodramatic convention that Tony made a very specific
choice to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Bui acknowledged this connection: ``I was trying to make
something that would be universal, but at the same time to voice
certain sensibilities that were Vietnamese.''
</P>
<P>
   Among these sensibilities are a love of flowers and poetry. The
Vietnamese love of metaphor is apparent in the words of Dang
himself, who saw Bui's film at the Berlin Film Festival in February
and who wrote from Vietnam, through an interpreter, to praise Bui's
ability to capture what Dang called ``the inner world of the
Vietnamese.''

<P>
   ``For those filmmakers who are living and working in Vietnam,
this type of search doesn't exist, because Vietnam is the
environment of their daily life,'' Dang wrote. ``Tony looked for
the first spring that feeds the beginning of the river, but we are
soaking in this river.''
</P>
<P>
   Bui is not, however, the only Vietnamese living abroad who is
making films in Vietnam today. Tran Anh Hung, the director of ``The
Scent of Green Papaya,'' who grew up in France, made his second
film, ``Cyclo'' (1996), in Vietnam and plans to do another there.
</P>
<P>
   Though he admires the older filmmaker's work, Bui said, he does
not consider Tran an influence. ``I was making `Yellow Lotus' even
before I had seen `Scent of Green Papaya,''' he said. ``And `Three
Seasons' is not a dialogue with `Cyclo': it's very much a personal
journey for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That journey is now leading Bui homeward, where ``Three
Seasons'' recently opened the San Francisco International
Asian-American Film Festival. But it is equally important to him,
he says, to reach out to audiences who are not Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   His next plan is to produce the feature that his brother,
Timothy, is going to direct this summer, about American camps
formed in 1975 for Vietnamese refugees waiting to receive formal
sponsorship to enter the country. He is also writing a script that
has nothing to do with Vietnam, the story of a man on a spiritual
journey that takes him from New York to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   All of Bui's projects seem to embrace the complexity inherent in
questions of identity, something he has learned about firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to dissect which part of me is Vietnamese, and
which American,'' he said. ``I've gained a lot by having experience
of both. It may be a constant struggle to understand where I fit
into it all, but it's a struggle I enjoy.''

A NEW HINT OF MISSED SIGNALS IN LITTLETON 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In the latest indication that law-enforcement officials
missed early warning signs about the Columbine High School gunmen,
the same sheriff's deputy who investigated their van break-in last
year also took the telephone complaint not long afterward that they
were setting off pipe bombs, a check of records shows.
</P>
<P>
   One week after the deputy, Mark M. Miller, wrote a report on the
pipe bomb complaint, a juvenile-court magistrate granted the two
teen-agers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, a form of probation for
the van break-in. In an interview last week, the magistrate, John
A. DeVita, said he would not have allowed probation had someone
told him of the complaint, which also included information that
Harris had posted three death threats against a classmate on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another indication of a lack of official information
sharing, reports this February by the teen-agers' probation officer
suggested that he, too, had no knowledge of the year-old bomb
complaint, or of a more recent complaint, dated July 19, 1998,
against Harris.
</P>
<P>
   In that later complaint, released by the authorities Tuesday,
Randy Brooks Brown, the father of the threatened classmate, told a
deputy that someone had fired a paint ball pellet through his
garage window, spattering red paint on his cars. Brown, who had
filed the bomb complaint four months earlier, told the deputy ``it
may have been'' Harris, a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the reports by the probation officer this February made no
mention of either complaint, spoke glowingly of both youths and
granted them two months' early termination from the youth diversion
program that had been a condition of their probation for the
break-in.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Office, said that the agency had a computerized database that
cross-referenced files by number, name and address, and that he
could not say why no one had picked up the warning signs waiting to
be added together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the deputy at the time to make the call if he has
enough evidence to put something together,'' Davis said. Referring
to the suburbs around Columbine High, he added, ``There are a
tremendous number of juvenile calls in the South End especially,
vehicles being broke into, criminal mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Miller, who both investigated the van break-in and took
the pipe bomb complaint, he was off duty Tuesday and did not return
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Brown family and some Colorado journalists
have criticized the sheriff's office for not sharing information
about the youths with the prosecutor in the van case, the
magistrate and the probationofficer. Chuck Green, a columnist for
The Denver Post, has called on Gov. Bill Owens to investigate the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' Green wrote, ``the sheriff's office shouldn't be
left to investigate itself and declare a verdict that might be seen
as self-serving.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Davis said Tuesday: ``The general consensus here
is, `Bring it on.' We feel everything was handled by the book. We
would welcome anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   New details emerged Tuesday about Mark E. Manes, the 22-year-old
arrested on Monday on suspicion of providing the two young gunmen a
Tec-DC9, a powerful semiautomatic pistol that was one of four
firearms they used in their assault on Columbine High, in
Littleton. Manufacture of the weapon has been barred by federal law
since 1994, although existing guns may be sold among adults _ but
not to minors _ without criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Robert L. Ransome, said Manes bought the weapon at a
gun show near Denver last fall and sold it in late February to one
of the youths. Ransome would not say which boy had bought the gun,
although both were then under 18.
</P>
<P>
   On three occasions in the month before the Columbine killings,
the lawyer said, Manes went up ``into the mountains'' with the two
youths to fire automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark did not know this was going to happen,'' Ransome said of
the Columbine killings. ``When you are up in the woods shooting
with kids, you just think, `Hey, they like weapons.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Manes lives around the corner from Isaiah Shoels, a Columbine
senior who was killed in the high school. Isaiah's mother, Diann
Manes, is a member of Handgun Control Inc., the nation's largest
gun-control lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been against guns forever,'' Ransome said, waving a
Handgun Control mass-mailing letter addressed to Mrs. Manes. ``Mark
grew up in a house where no weapons were present.''
</P>
<P>
   Manes' arrest on Monday was not his first brush with local law
enforcement. From age 16 to 19, he was cited four times for
under-age drinking. During that time, he was also stopped five
times for traffic violations, once, when he was 17, for trying to
elude a police officer after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   After attending Columbine High for his freshman year and the
first half of his sophomore year, Manes later attended an
alternative high school and a community college, and now works as a
computer programmer. He met Harris and Klebold through a young man
on his street who delivered pizza for the same Blackjack Pizza
outlet where the two teen-agers had after-school jobs as cooks.

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some people say there has never been a ``Death of a
Salesman'' with a Linda Loman like that of Elizabeth Franz. The
play's author is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the actress' portrayal in the 50th-anniversary
production now on Broadway, Arthur Miller said, ``She has
discovered in the role the basic underlying powerful
protectiveness, which comes out as fury, and that in the past, in
every performance I know of, was simply washed out.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something else: a sexual bond between Ms. Franz's Linda
and the Willy Loman of Brian Dennehy that, Miller said, ``I always
assumed was there, but here it is far more emphasized _
correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Loman is usually played as a beaten-down figure, a
dishrag. She is a prop for her husband's despair over losing his
job, and his worries about his sons, Biff (played in the current
version by Kevin Anderson), a failed athlete and occasional thief,
and Happy (Ted Koch), a banally self-confident loser.
</P>
<P>
   But in the production at the Eugene O'Neill Theater, which was
first staged last year at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, Ms.
Franz's Linda is no passive victim. She is an actor in her
husband's fate, engaged in a primal war with the gods as she
struggles to pull him from the abyss into which he is ineluctably
falling.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Ms. Franz received a Tony nomination as best
featured actress for her portrayal of Linda. The production
garnered a total of six, with Dennehy, Anderson and Robert Falls,
the director, among them. Miller will receive a special Tony for
lifetime achievement in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Franz's analysis of Willy and Linda's relationship may
surprise traditionalists. ``They are very sexually bound
together,'' the actress said in a recent interview. ``For Linda,
Willy is everything. She could do without her sons.''
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of sexual relationship, she added: ``You can say
anything because you know in the end you're going be in that bed,
curled up and having the most wonderful conversations. When she's
curled up in his arms and she's singing to him _ you can't tell me
that isn't a very sexual moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress was speaking in an Upper West Side apartment she has
rented during the play's run. She shares it with her 100-pound
companion, Max, ``the tallest German shepherd seen.'' Usually, she
lives in an old farmhouse in northwest Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write a novel about the characters I play,'' Ms. Franz
confided. ``Linda,'' she said, ``was very close to her parents. She
fell head over heels in love with Willy. Her parents were very
strongly against this marriage, but she defied them and never saw
them again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are secrets,'' Ms. Franz added, with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She insists that her performance derives from Miller's text and
quotes Happy, who wants to marry: ```Somebody with character, with
resistance! Like mom.''' And then mentions Willy's line, ```You're
my foundation and my support, Linda.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her blond hair stylishly cropped, Ms. Franz, who is 57, seems at
least 10 years younger than the onstage Linda, with her 1940s
pageboy. The actress' soft-spoken manner hardly suggests her other
well-known role, that of the demented nun in Christopher Durang's
satire ``Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You'' in the
early 1980s, which won her an Obie award.
</P>
<P>
   She told Durang that she wanted to play Sister Mary because she
understood her. ``They thought, `Maybe we should audition her, if
she's so sick she understands Sister Mary,''' Ms. Franz said.
</P>
<P>
   A killer look came into her eyes. ``Why don't you drop that
polite-boy manner, buster,'' she said, summoning the lines from
memory. ``You do that thing that makes Jesus puke, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   For her portrayal of Linda in ``Death of a Salesman,'' Ms. Franz
said, she used memories of her father, Joe Frankovitch, who worked
at a tire factory in Akron, Ohio, for 36 years. Her father, who was
Serbo-Croatian, had diabetes and missed two and a half months of
work because of bad medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The day he returned, ``they fired him right away,'' Ms. Franz
said, with no pension. ``He got a gold watch, which he had to pawn
to pay the mortgage.'' He died the day the mortgage was paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resonance of my father came to me,'' Ms. Franz said. ``You
look at Brian, a mammoth of a man, disintegrating in front of your
eyes. You realize there's no way you can help him.'' The disparity
in their sizes seems to underscore the futility of this small,
slender Linda saving the large, baffled Willy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are also echoes of Ms. Franz's father in Willy's tortured
relationship with his sons. Ms. Franz recalls her father fighting
with one of her brothers, and his remorse after the boy left home.
``I have a lot of Willy Lomans in my life,'' Ms. Franz said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Harriet, who was half American Indian and half
Irish, suffered from mental problems, Ms. Franz said. As a child,
she found her behavior sometimes frightening. ``My grandmother
would hide me in her closet,'' the actress said. Other times, her
mother disappeared. ``I remember holding onto my father and saying,
`She'll come back.'''
</P>
<P>
   When she was 5, she saw Loretta Young in ``The Bishop's Wife''
and decided to be an actress. Acting would enable her to express
the emotions she had to restrain when she tried to comfort her
father or take care of her mother.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Ms. Franz worked as a secretary, saving until
she could enroll at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New
York. There, she said, a teacher told her she was a good actress
but might not get work until she was in her 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Franz said she received some of her best training in summer
stock, ``the only place I could get to do ingenues.'' Later came
regional theater. She has had a career as a supporting actress,
often playing characters older than herself. She portrayed the same
character of the mother in Neil Simon's ``Brighton Beach Memoirs''
and his ``Broadway Bound.''
</P>
<P>
   But her career, she said, has been stymied because Broadway
producers often import British productions and then British actors
to play the leads.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years, Ms. Franz shared her life with Edward Binns, a
character actor. They married in 1983; Binns died in 1990. There is
a new man in her life now, a screenwriter in California, ``with
(italics)two(end italics) dogs,'' Ms. Franz said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Falls, who is also the artistic chief of the Goodman Theater,
said he chose Ms. Franz to play Linda because ``I love the strength
she possesses.'' He also liked the way her strength would appear
``to be fragility in contrast to Brian Dennehy's size.''
</P>
<P>
   When he invited Ms. Franz to lunch, Falls discovered that her
view of Linda matched his. ``She is far more a wife than a
mother,'' Falls said. ``She is devoted to Willy in a fierce way.
She exists to protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a contemporary performance. ``It would have been
inconceivable,'' Falls said, ``that an American woman could have
played the role that way _ she would have been deemed unladylike _
because there had to be a kind of `niceness' in 1948-49,'' when the
play was first produced.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Franz has portrayed Linda once before _ in 1996 opposite Hal
Holbrook in a performance Falls did not see. But Holbrook was a
more broken, defeated Willy than Brian Dennehy, Ms. Franz said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until she began rehearsals with Dennehy last year
that she really ``found'' Linda. Because of Dennehy's more
aggressive Willy, she was forced to assume a more aggressive
personality to match his, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made me know how to love him as a woman,'' Ms. Franz added.
``And he is so similar to my father in build, in his outrage over
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Ms. Franz's conception that is being used for the last
moments of ``Death of a Salesman.'' Linda flings herself onto
Willy's grave, as if to lie close to him one last time. ``Willy,
dear,'' Linda says, ``I can't cry. Why did you do it? I search and
search and I search, and I can't understand it.''

ESPN SUES TO PRESERVE MLB CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN filed suit in federal court Tuesday seeking to prevent
Major League Baseball from terminating its $40 million-per-year
contract with the cable sports giant.
</P>
<P>
   The suit revolves around ESPN's right to put three baseball
games on its sister network, ESPN2, in order to air higher-rated
professional football games in September.
</P>
<P>
   Though the contract doesn't specifically mention NFL games, ESPN
officials said it gives them the right to bump up to 10 baseball
games for ``events of significant viewer interest.'' Further, ESPN
said, baseball tried to ``extort'' about $350 million from ESPN to
renegotiate the contract.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, events for which baseball games have been bumped
included the College World Series, auto racing, pro golf, NHL
playoff games, and World Cup soccer. Major League Baseball has the
right to approve such preemptions, and as far as anyone can recall,
it approved every one until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball does have a point: ESPN has 76.2 million
subscribers, ESPN2 64.5 million. But it's a small point. The real
issue is whether baseball can get more money from television
networks. ESPN recently renewed its deal with the NHL for a total
of $600 million, about $120 million per year. It is also paying
about $600 million over the next eight years to air 18 NFL games
per season on Sunday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by last year's historic home run chase of Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa, Major League Baseball balked at games being
bumped to ESPN2 this year. The sides sparred until April 21, when
ESPN received a letter from baseball's chief operating officer,
Paul Beeston, informing the network that the contract would be
terminated at the end of this regular season instead of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN thought they had an opportunity to make a lot more on the
NFL and decided not to pay attention to us,'' Rich Levin, a
spokesman for MLB, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   The sports business is filled with short memories. Just four
years ago, baseball was devastated by a player strike and the
failure of its join television arrangement with ABC and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN came to the rescue in 1997 by agreeing to air hours and
hours of games, and Sosa and McGwire infused popularity back into
the sport last season. All of that good will was erased Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense to us,'' said Dick Glover, ESPN's executive
vice president of programming.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN president George Bodenheimer went further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about nine hours of programming in the course
of the almost 500 hours of dedicated MLB coverage we provide each
year,'' Bodenheimer said. ``It's outrageous for baseball to attempt
to terminate its agreement with ESPN.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially considering the efforts made by ESPN to make up for
bumping games.
</P>
<P>
   Glover said ESPN was willing to allow the three games assigned
to ESPN2 to also be aired in local markets on over-the-air
stations. That would give baseball even greater distribution than
ESPN could provide.
</P>
<P>
   When that offer was rejected, ESPN countered with another. It
offered to give the games back to the teams and allow them to place
them anywhere they could. In addition, the Sunday night games could
be traded for ``more meaningful'' games to be picked up by ESPN on
Tuesdays and Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN even offered to forgive Major League Baseball for one game
per season that couldn't be delivered because of of rain or other
unforeseeable events. ESPN also was willing to expand its
``Baseball Tonight'' show to two hours to highlight the pennant
race.
</P>
<P>
   All ESPN received back from Major League Baseball was a demand
for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball wanted to renegotiate its $40 million-a-year deal to
$135 million a year. In its suit, ESPN said that ``baseball has
attempted to extort hundreds of millions of dollars of economic
concessions'' as the price of letting ESPN move the games.
</P>
<P>
   The average rating for a baseball game on ESPN is about 1, while
football does much better. Last year, for instance, September
baseball games averaged a 1.7 rating. The three football games that
month averaged a 7.3.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, baseball on ESPN has averaged a paltry 1.3
rating.

 &HT;    Klesko calm about slump
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The home runs haven't exactly been pouring in for
Braves first baseman Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   He's had only one this year in his first 46 at-bats and four in
his last 179 at-bats, going back to last July. But Klesko, who's
missed nine games with a hamstring pull, isn't going to get worked
up about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go out and hit five in a week,'' Klesko said. ``As long
as I'm hitting the ball hard, line drives, the power numbers are
going to come...Maybe when I was younger, I'd start worrying,
swinging at the fences, but that's the worst thing you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko got his only home run of 1999 in the second game of the
season, a two-run job off the Phillies Chad Ogea. Seven games later
he pulled his hamstring in Philadelphia and didn't return to the
lineup until last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else was kind of piling up numbers, RBI, hits,''
hitting coach Don Baylor said. ``He felt he had to come back and
catch up in one day...Last night he got back to where he was when
he left.''
</P>
<P>
   Since returning, Klesko endured a 1-for-15 stretch before going
2 for 3 on Monday night. His average was .407 when he first hurt
himself in Philadelphia on April 14. Three weeks later it's .326.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was swinging at everything,'' Klesko said of his 1-for-15
spell. ``I don't think I swung at three or four strikes the whole
time. I should have known better than that. I just want to try and
find a rhythm and relax and get back in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter plays hero
</P>
<P>
   From being released by the St. Louis Cardinals last August to
beating them with a run-scoring single on Monday night for the
Braves isn't as big a jump as some might think. For Brian Hunter,
it may just be a matter of how he's been perceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I had to change anything - I believed in my
ability - it's a matter of someone else believing in me,'' Hunter
said. ``I don't think (Cardinals manager) Tony (La Russa) had ever
seen me play with his being in the American League, I came up in
the National League. He didn't know what I could do. Being with
Bobby, Bobby drafted me when I was 19, brought me up when I was 23.
He knows how I play. I can't fault (LaRussa).''

   Hunter has been involved in some key Brave rallies this season.
He started the seven-run 12th that helped beat the Dodgers 11-4
with a single. He's now 2 for 4 as a pinch hitter and hitting .333
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say you don't want to do too much because you do,''
Hunter said. ``I'm really out there trying to do something. The
difference in me being in St. Louis is I put too much pressure on
myself trying to impress Tony. Here if I don't get a hit, I know
I'll get another chance somewhere down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy on McGwire
</P>
<P>
   For the rookie who struck out slugger Mark McGwire with three
pitches on Monday night, Kevin McGlinchy has this to say for
himself:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good feeling to get out of the inning,'' McGlinchy
said. ``It was a big inning, score tied 1-1 in a good
pressure-filled situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He threw McGwire fastball, slider, fastball, the last of which
caught McGwire looking at an outside strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went after him like any other hitter,'' McGlinchy said. ``I
didn't want to give in to him. He'd never seen me, I'd never seen
him. That helps a lot....The next time I think he'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker mends
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker has had some soreness in both his elbow and shoulder
this spring, but for the first time in quite a while Rocker went
without getting any treatment in the Braves clubhouse on Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night I felt as good as I've felt all year,'' said
Rocker, who picked up his third save of the year on Monday in his
third consecutive night of work. ``I'm used to getting biceps
tendinitis every year. It's probably something I've got to go
through to get in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves bearing hardware
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-game ceremony on Tuesday night, Braves were honored
with the presentation of quite a few 1998 awards. Tom Glavine was
presented with his second Cy Young award, which he was originally
presented at a banquet in New York, and his fourth Silver Slugger
for being the top hitting pitcher in the National League. Greg
Maddux was presented his ninth Gold Glove, while Andruw Jones and
Bret Boone each picked up their first Gold Gloves. Glavine was also
awarded as the Brave of the year by the Atlanta chapter of the
Baseball Writers Association of America.

OKLAHOMANS ASSESS THE DAMAGE FROM MONSTER TWISTER, VOW TO REBUILD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA, REBECA RODRIGUEZ and JENNIFER AUTRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Their cities pulverized, yet miraculously spared
greater human loss, Oklahomans raked through splintered ruins on
Tuesday, vowing to rise from the destruction of a behemont twister
that ravished its namesake Tornado Alley.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's swirling 260-mph winds killed at least 38 people in
Oklahoma City and outlying cities, injured hundreds, destroyed
2,000 buildings and left thousands without homes or electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The largest twister formed about 45 miles southwest of Oklahoma
City late Monday afternoon and cut a path at least a half-mile
wide, staying on the ground for up to four hours, according to some
estimates, as TV stations tracked and televised its vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one did not go up and down,'' Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating
said after surveying the damage. ``This was a half-mile-wide
tornado the length of an aircraft carrier that just sat down and
stayed on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on NBC's ``Today'' show, he said, ``We have
whole communities that simply aren't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation, Keating promised that Oklahomans ``will
rebuild this state. We'll be back stronger than we ever were.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor mobilized the National Guard to help in the rescues
and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The entire state was declared a disaster area and President
Clinton approved federal assistance, saying he also planned to
visit Oklahoma on Saturday for a tour of the devastated areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the damage in Oklahoma City, it looks like
the warning system did work well for the death toll to be so low,
when you see the amount of catastrophic damage there was,'' said
Dave Imy of the Storm Prediction Center in Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Hansen, an assistant fire chief in Oklahoma City, likened
the scene to that of the Oklahoma bombing on April 19, 1995: ``It
looks like the Murrah Building, but instead of nine stories tall,
it's spread out over a large area.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Charles Allen, Oklahoma City police spokesman, also
recalled the bombing and how the city responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like the national champions when it comes to dealing
with disasters,'' Allen said. ``We bury our dead. We take care of
our wounded. We rebuild. We move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Oklahoma communities fell victim to the twister's vicious
force. The most deadly was Bridge Creek, about 30 miles southwest
of Oklahoma City, where 11 people were killed. Other fatalities
were in Oklahoma City and nearby Midwest City, Moore, Del City and
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Spawned by the same storm system that raked Oklahoma, another
tornado cut a path 12 miles long and three miles wide in Kansas,
killing five people and injuring 100 in southern Wichita and
suburban Haysville.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the Oklahoma toll, the tornado outbreak was the
nation's deadliest since 42 people were killed in Florida last
year. It was also the deadliest such tragedy to hit Oklahoma since
April 9, 1947, when a twister killed 113 people in Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   While on its destructive tear in Oklahoma, the tornadoes crossed
four freeways and brushed Tinker Air Force Base, wiping out or
damaging half of the homes in Moore, a city of 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   One Oklahoma state trooper likened the destruction in a Moore
neighborhood to a war zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen pictures of the damage in Kosovo _ well just go
down there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Oklahoma City area, cars were tossed about and
crushed, natural gas lines were ruptured and utility poles were
shredded into kindling.
</P>
<P>
   Along Interstates 35 and 240, the storm littered the freeway
shoulders with debris and personal items from as far away as
Chickasha, where the tornadoes began their rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents, taking advantage of ample warning provided by a
radar system that allowed televisions to track its path street by
street, fled in advance of the mammoth funnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many lives were saved by the early warning,'' said
Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk Humphreys.
</P>
<P>
   The early warning alerted an off-duty police officer to lead to
shelter about 300 students meeting at West Moore High School, most
likely saving them from serious injury or death, said Capt. Charles
Allen, Oklahoma City police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most tornadoes that hop-scotch around, this one didn't.
It was so big it seemed to rumble, wiping out everything in its
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `There's no way something that big moves
on this earth,''' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't miss it,'' said Randy Lacy, a Moore resident who
watched it pass within a mile of his home. ``Every time you looked,
the storm looked like it was coming right at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred Carr, director of the University of Oklahoma School of
Meterology, called the tornado's one-mile width ``extreme'' and
``just a few percent will do that in a given year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most tornadoes, he said, measure only 500 to 600 feet wide, skip
across landscape and don't pack the wallop necessary to rate an F5
classification on the Fujita Scale _ the highest storm severity
designation, meaning winds in excess of 260 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, ambulances and U-hauls crawled through the
ruins of what once was a cozy, diverse subdivision in southeast
Oklahoma City called Frolich Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and daughters hugged and cried as they looked upon acres
of haunting, twisted trees and 8-foot-high mounds of oozing pink
fiberglass insulation, broken bricks and splintered wood, all that
was left of what had been $80,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners, such as Carol Warner, 62, and her husband,
survived the tornado by clinging to pillows on the floor of their
hall bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ears were popping and I could feel the gusts like they were
going to suck me into the air,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Warners lived to talk about their terror, others did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a back-hoe lifted a van off the collapsed
bathroom of a neighbor's house, where rescuers worked more than
four hours to retrieve the body of Jack Self, 86, a retired
minister known in the community simply as ``Brother Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the family of Aaron LeClaire, 47, a computer specialist
for the Federal Aviation Administration, stopped looking for their
three-wheeler to watch a neighbor search for his wife under a mound
of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   What had been a thick line of tall trees that separated their
properties was now two feet high, and the neighbor's grief played
out as he frantically cried, ``Linda! Linda! Linda!''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, rescue workers found his wife dead.
</P>
<P>
   Along the southern edge of Oklahoma City, drivers jammed
two-lane county roads in a futile attempt to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't going nowhere,'' said Carl Haynes. ``I don't know
what's left of my home, but this can't be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating urged Oklahoma residents to follow the neighborly
example set during the Oklahoma City bombing four years ago,
warning businesses not to gouge customers and take advantage of
their plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your neighbor is homeless, take him in,'' Keating said.
``If your neighbor is without clothing or food, make sure they get
what they need.''

RECORD TORNADOES BRING DEATH, DESTRUCTION TO OKLAHOMA, KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDWEST CITY, Okla. _ Tami Low has lived here all her life, well
aware the town's name might as well be ``Tornado City.'' She grew
so used to the yearly weather warnings that last spring, she and
her husband took a drive out to the suburbs to try to catch a
glimpse when one blew through.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Low had to go no farther than her porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't need to,'' Low, 33, said Tuesday night, tearing up
as she picked through piles of glass in her demolished living room,
beneath a crumbling ceiling on the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Out back, behind a forest of flattened elm trees, what was once
a neighborhood of single-story ranch homes lay in flat rubble, a
virtual highway carved by one of the worst tornadoes ever to hit
this suburb of Oklahoma City, or, indeed, the region.
</P>
<P>
   Low, her husband and their four children survived the brutal
storm Monday night, huddled together in a six-foot by six-foot
bathroom, pillows clamped over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighboring home, however, a four-year-old boy was killed.
And even in a part of the country so accustomed to tornado season,
it was the randomness _ and the lethality _ of the storm that
seemed most overwhelming in the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Officials confirmed 38 deaths in Oklahoma and five in Kansas,
making this the deadliest wave of tornadoes since 42 people were
killed in February 1998 in Kissimmee, Fla. It was also the worst
weather-related tragedy in Oklahoma since a tornado killed 113
people in Woodward in April 9, 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds were injured, including more than 500 in Oklahoma City
and more than 100 in Wichita, Kan. At least 1,500 businesses and
homes were destroyed or heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers swept through the wreckage twice Tuesday to look for
survivors, then brought in bulldozers to make a third search in the
afternoon. At least one woman was found alive in a trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared a major disaster for 11 counties in
Oklahoma and one county in Kansas. The president also ordered
federal aid, including disaster housing, grants, and low-cost loans
to cover uninsured property. Jamie Lee Witt, director of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, is traveling to Oklahoma City
to oversee federal relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our top priority is to make sure people are safe,
that everyone is accounted for, and that initial cleanup can
begin,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the president is considering a trip
to the tornado zone on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated the group of tornadoes traveled as much as
80 miles after forming 45 miles southwest of Oklahoma City on
Monday afternoon. Over the next 20 hours, as many as four dozen
tornadoes developed, moving diagonally toward the northeastern
corner of the state. The deadliest of the twisters measured nearly
a mile wide as it swept through Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   The same weather system spawned the Kansas tornado, which struck
about 8:30 p.m. Monday and cut a swath 12 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tornadoes moved swiftly across the flat countryside,
sometimes striking just minutes after a tornado warning had been
issued, officials said the number of deaths and injuries was held
down because the public responded to warnings and took cover
underground.
</P>
<P>
   A huge storm system was first detected at about 4 p.m. CDT
Monday by the National Weather Service in Norman, Okla., as a mass
of cold air from the north collided with warm, moist air from the
south. At 4:47, the weather service issued its first tornado
warning of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The main storm formed near Chikasha, about 45 miles southwest of
Oklahoma City. A funnel was spotted at about 5:30, and moving
toward the northesast, hit the municipal airport about 15 minutes
later. But the twister remained several miles and northwest of the
heavily populated areas of Chikasha.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of bypassed us,'' said Chickasha police Captain Lynn
Williams. ``We got extremely lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6:51, the National Weather Service issued a severe
thunderstorm warning for the Oklahoma City area. Soon, the advisory
was upgraded to a tornado warning _ just minutes before the twister
hit the city.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, the deaths occurred in Wichita and suburban
Haysville, where some mobile homes from the Lake Shore Trailer Park
were hurled into a nearby lake. At least 150 homes, 27 businesses,
and three churches were damaged in Haysville.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy,'' said Eric Peterson, a recent transplant from
Seattle who end up with a tree in his bedroom. ``I have been in
typhoons in the South Pacific and in hurricans, but this tops it.''
</P>
<P>
   While residents were trying to recover from the devastation,
insurance claims adjusters were on the scene Tuesday, evaluating
the cost of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   While estimates won't be available for several days, some
believed the losses will be the steepest ever caused by a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We studied 37 mid-sized to large catastophes last year,'' said
John Eager, director of claims services for the National
Association of Independent Insurers. ``I don't remember any that
were as devastating as this one seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   The costliest tornado on record struck Xenia, Ohio, in April
1974, causing $400 million in damage, according to the Property
Claim Services unit of New York-based Insurance Services Office
Inc. Adjusted for inflation, that's about $1.3 billion.

ESPN SUES TO PRESERVE MLB CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN filed suit in federal court Tuesday seeking to prevent
Major League Baseball from terminating its $40 million-per-year
contract with the cable sports giant.
</P>
<P>
   The suit revolves around ESPN's right to put three baseball
games on its sister network, ESPN2, in order to air higher-rated
professional football games in September.
</P>
<P>
   Though the contract doesn't specifically mention NFL games, ESPN
officials said it gives them the right to bump up to 10 baseball
games for ``events of significant viewer interest.'' Further, ESPN
said, baseball tried to ``extort'' about $350 million from ESPN to
renegotiate the contract.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, events for which baseball games have been bumped
included the College World Series, auto racing, pro golf, NHL
playoff games, and World Cup soccer. Major League Baseball has the
right to approve such preemptions, and as far as anyone can recall,
it approved every one until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball does have a point: ESPN has 76.2 million
subscribers, ESPN2 64.5 million. But it's a small point. The real
issue is whether baseball can get more money from television
networks. ESPN recently renewed its deal with the NHL for a total
of $600 million, about $120 million per year. It is also paying
about $600 million over the next eight years to air 18 NFL games
per season on Sunday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by last year's historic home run chase of Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa, Major League Baseball balked at games being
bumped to ESPN2 this year. The sides sparred until April 21, when
ESPN received a letter from baseball's chief operating officer,
Paul Beeston, informing the network that the contract would be
terminated at the end of this regular season instead of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN thought they had an opportunity to make a lot more on the
NFL and decided not to pay attention to us,'' Rich Levin, a
spokesman for MLB, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   The sports business is filled with short memories. Just four
years ago, baseball was devastated by a player strike and the
failure of its join television arrangement with ABC and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN came to the rescue in 1997 by agreeing to air hours and
hours of games, and Sosa and McGwire infused popularity back into
the sport last season. All of that good will was erased Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense to us,'' said Dick Glover, ESPN's executive
vice president of programming.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN president George Bodenheimer went further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about nine hours of programming in the course
of the almost 500 hours of dedicated MLB coverage we provide each
year,'' Bodenheimer said. ``It's outrageous for baseball to attempt
to terminate its agreement with ESPN.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially considering the efforts made by ESPN to make up for
bumping games.
</P>
<P>
   Glover said ESPN was willing to allow the three games assigned
to ESPN2 to also be aired in local markets on over-the-air
stations. That would give baseball even greater distribution than
ESPN could provide.
</P>
<P>
   When that offer was rejected, ESPN countered with another. It
offered to give the games back to the teams and allow them to place
them anywhere they could. In addition, the Sunday night games could
be traded for ``more meaningful'' games to be picked up by ESPN on
Tuesdays and Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN even offered to forgive Major League Baseball for one game
per season that couldn't be delivered because of of rain or other
unforeseeable events. ESPN also was willing to expand its
``Baseball Tonight'' show to two hours to highlight the pennant
race.
</P>
<P>
   All ESPN received back from Major League Baseball was a demand
for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball wanted to renegotiate its $40 million-a-year deal to
$135 million a year. In its suit, ESPN said that ``baseball has
attempted to extort hundreds of millions of dollars of economic
concessions'' as the price of letting ESPN move the games.
</P>
<P>
   The average rating for a baseball game on ESPN is about 1, while
football does much better. Last year, for instance, September
baseball games averaged a 1.7 rating. The three football games that
month averaged a 7.3.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, baseball on ESPN has averaged a paltry 1.3
rating.

 Video Games, Net Unfairly Blamed For Kids' Violence
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Screaming newspaper headlines and talking heads on TV suggest that
the Internet and crimson-stained, shoot-'em-up computer games Doom
and Quake are culpable for the massacre at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   But blaming the newest form of mass media for mass murder is a
simplistic explanation for deeper cultural problems, say media
pundits, academics and Net-savvy teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so crazy and hysterical,'' said Jon Katz, media critic
for Rolling Stone and the Slashdot Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue should be how teenagers get their hands on
machine guns and bombs _ not about a Web site and video games,''
Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are issues of parental guidance, gun control and why
high school is such a nightmare for kids who are different. But for
many it's easier to blame the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems run deeper; they involve issues like gun control,
parental supervision and teenage peer groups, experts say. Still,
violent media images reflect the nation's preoccupation with
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is an extremely violent society,'' acknowledged John
Stauber, executive director for the Center for Media &AMP; Democracy in
Madison, Wis. ``The Internet and video games in particular have
introduced an added dimension of graphic images.''
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on pipe-bomb-making tutorials and hate-filled invective
that appeared on teenage killer Eric Harris' Web site, social
commentators were quick to demonize technology after the Littleton
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But individuals who are steeped in Internet culture say that's
too pat an answer. Anna Everett, an assistant professor in the
Department of Film Studies at the University of California at Santa
Barbara, said she was ``struck by the rhetoric of Internet
culpability peppering news reports'' after a Web page was linked to
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is that the Internet will be scapegoated in our
national rush to indict the media for this tragedy,'' Everett said.
``As the newest mass medium that threatens many vested interests
and strikes terror in the hearts of many technophobes and
neo-Luddites, the Internet is especially vulnerable to knee-jerk
reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   It has become fashionable for self-proclaimed experts to blame
the Net and video games, and the press has lapped up the half-baked
theories verbatim, media critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with one crank, and one TV news director who's
willing to give the crank a five-second sound bite,'' said Bob
Rossney, a computer consultant and writer in Boulder, Colo. ``From
that point on, the stupid idea is in the media sphere, and the
story about the stupid idea practically writes itself. And who can
resist a story that writes itself?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, those who are most likely to suffer are teens
like Bandy, a high school student in New York who revels in Quake
and Doom but is now treated with suspicion. ``I (play) till 3 a.m.
every night,'' she said in an e-mail. ``I really love it. But after
Colorado, things got horrible. People were actually talking to me
like I could come in and kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Littleton fallout has affected teenagers nationwide. Many
school administrators have singled out nonconformist high school
students for anti-social behavior _ which can be as innocuous as
wearing black T-shirts or identifying as Goths. Many are being sent
home to change clothes if they're similar to what the killers wore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made the lives of outsiders, misfits and oddballs that
much harder by making them suspects for the next great tragedy,''
Katz said. ``It is a national witch hunt; I call it geek
profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz said he received 6,000 to 7,000 messages from disaffected
youths in an ``outpouring of pain and misery'' after an online
essay he wrote on technology and Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown started as soon as the gunmen, Harris and Dylan
Klebold, were described as outsiders associated with the Goth
subculture and linked to the school's anti-clique, known as the
Trench Coat Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' Internet page describes how to build pipe bombs and
muses, among other ghoulish thoughts, about wanting to go ``to some
downtown area in some big (expletive) city and blow up and shoot
everything I can.''
</P>
<P>
   According to other accounts, Harris and Klebold were ardent
players of Doom and Quake, video games that feature wholesale
slaughters of digital enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in their right mind can deny that the media has an
effect _ both good and bad _ on us,'' said Jan LaRue, senior
director of legal studies at Family Research Council in Washington,
D.C. ``It is pretty well proven that children with a regular diet
of violent programming become desensitized to graphic gore and
killing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But many incidents comparable to the Littleton crime predate
the World Wide Web. Many cited Charles Whitman, who gunned down 45
people, and killed 14, from a tower at the University of Texas in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Son of Sam said his dog made him kill people (in the
1970s), should we have banned dogs back then?'' said Steven
Johnson, editor and founder of Feed magazine in New York. ``Of
course not. The argument is silly.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Instead of asking why, why, why?, we should be asking what,
what, what can we do to stop this?'' said actor Robert Urich,
former star of the TV cop show ``Vegas'' and co-founder of Computer
Sentry Software ( &LR; www.sentryinc.com &LR; ), a maker of security
software. ``A little regulation, and a lot of parental supervision
and self regulation, is a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to take an isolated incident and blame it on video
games,'' Feed magazine's Johnson said. ``Yet over the last four
years, we've experienced the greatest drop in violent crime in the
United States in 40 years. If anything, video games have little
effect on kids. Twenty million kids play video games.''
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile arrests for violent crime are down 10 percent since
1995, an FBI report said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is not investigating the Internet's limited role in the
killings, spokesman Gary Gomez said.

AS RESIDENTS TRY TO FLEE STORM CELL, TORNADO TRACKERS PURSUE IT
</HEADLINE>

By ANITA BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine times on Monday, Joshua Wurman and his storm-chasing team
of scientists from the University of Oklahoma saw clouds drop out
of the sky and spin.
</P>
<P>
   The first two tornadoes they spotted Monday afternoon helped
their research, but the third one that dropped near the tiny town
of Cement, Okla., took them on the ride of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours, they chased a half-mile-wide tornado with
winds clocked in excess of 200 mph as it swept through Chickasha,
Newcastle, Moore, Del City and then Midwest City, killing dozens
and destroying thousands of homes before vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   Their adrenaline surged as their van sped toward the
debris-filled spiral, stopped to set up Doppler radar long enough
to record data about the twister, then rushed back into the van to
continue the chase.
</P>
<P>
   While others fled from the path of the dozens of tornadoes in
Oklahoma and Kansas, Wurman _ nationally renowned tornado chaser _
and his team pursued the deadly twister.
</P>
<P>
   Fear seldom crossed their minds, Wurman said, even though they
were once within a few hundred feet from what scientists gauged as
at least an F4 tornado, the second-strongest level on the Fujita
Scale.
</P>
<P>
   But a pinprick of reality invaded their scientific sphere in
Moore, on the southwestern edge of Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove through Moore probably a minute after the tornado,
through the damage path,'' Wurman said.
</P>
<P>
   The twister cut a three-mile-long, five-to-six-block wide swath
through the town, destroying hundreds of homes, smashing
automobiles and uprooting trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to see,'' Wurman said.
</P>
<P>
   Louis J. Wicker, an associate professor of meteorology at Texas
A&AMP;M University, said, ``In terms of a single tornado, it will be
among the top 10 in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Wurman added that the data scientists collected Monday might
lead to a better assessment of how massive tornadoes work and
enable scientists to give residents more warning before such
devastation hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not much we can do to prevent the homes from being
destroyed,'' Wurman said. ``We hope we can get them to shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reports said the half-mile-wide tornado was on the ground
for an unprecedented four hours, but Wurman estimated the time as
closer to an hour or two. He didn't keep track of the duration, but
will have a precise time line when researchers sift through the
tons of computer data his team collected for the 12-hour period
they trailed tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   But even one or two hours is rare, Wurman and other scientists
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty uncommon for an hour and happens only a couple of
times a year,'' Wicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday started as a favorable day for tornadoes, but not a
perfect one, Wurman said. Because of high cloud cover, which can
inhibit tornado development, some storm chasers didn't go out to
hunt for tornadoes, he said. Wurman and a few other tornado
watchers decided to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists don't completely understand the complexities of
tornadoes, but they know that when hot and cold air collide, the
hot air rushes rapidly upward, pulling even more air up from the
earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing stops the circulation, the air masses can begin to
twist and turn the huge cloud mass.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, several supercell storms developed over Oklahoma and
Kansas dropping maybe 50 or more tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes of such duration and intensity as those described
Monday afternoon through early Tuesday morning occur only when the
atmosphere is very unstable and updraft winds reach at least 150
mph with nothing to shut it off, Wicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Wurman said they had the half-mile-wide twister in their sight
for most of the 40 miles it traveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it was continuous, although we can't say 100
percent for certain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using Doppler radar, Wurman and his team spotted an even bigger
tornado at least a mile wide about 11 p.m. between Crescent and
Mulhall, north of Oklahoma City, he said.
</P>
<P>
   University of Oklahoma researchers should have some details
about the twisters within a few days, Wurman said.
</P>
<P>
   Had the storm hit at 2 a.m. when more people were home asleep,
many more would have died, Wurman said.
</P>
<P>
   The misfortune Monday ``was not that it was just a large
tornado, but that it lasted a long time and passed through a
populated area,'' he said. ``I am amazed with the description that
more were not killed.''

 `Living Wage' _ Effects On Firms
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  How would San Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammiano's $11
``living wage'' proposal affect the thousands of small businesses
based in the city?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  The living wage proposal is making a lot of
businesses livid, but it by no means affects everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The current proposal, which still is subject to change and a lot
of economic analysis before a vote, would raise the minimum wage
from $5.75 to $11 an hour for businesses that provide more than
$25,000 of annual services to the city and county of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses that provide goods, like office supplies, to the city
would be immune. But businesses that lease land from the city, like
shops and restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and other port
property as well as Moscone Center and the airport, would be
subject to paying the higher minimum wage just like service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the near-doubling of the hourly wage, affected
businesses would be required to provide health benefits; 12 days of
paid vacation, sick or personal leave each year; and 10 days of
unpaid leave.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the financial impact range from $15 million to $100
million. There are no clear numbers, but Jim Mathias, public
affairs manager for the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, said the
impact is likely to be 10 to 20 times greater than mandated city
contract wage increases had on Oakland and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   That's because so many more workers are affected in San
Francisco. For example, there are about 6,500 health services
workers who make home visits to the city's elderly, sick and
disabled who get paid about $7 an hour. There also are many
thousands of workers who work for businesses that pay rent to the
city that will be disadvantaged severely if the living wage bill
passes without any amendments, Mathias said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, restaurant waiters who make $5.75 an hour in wages
but a multiple of that in tips would get their base wage raised to
$11 an hour. Some members of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association
that operate on city land estimate that they would have to raise
their prices 30 percent to remain profitable. However, that would
be extremely difficult to do in the highly competitive food
business.
</P>
<P>
   One casualty could be Fog City Diner, which operates on port
land and competes with Il Fornaio on the other side of Battery
Street, which would be immune from the living wage ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for business opponents, some city officials, including
the mayor, are proposing careful economic analysis before the
living wage ordinance goes to a vote. There also are questions
about who is going to pay all the bills because the city is facing
a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Mathias believes that the issue could drag into the summer or
beyond. The earliest the higher wage could be imposed is a year
from September _ the beginning of the 2001 fiscal year. Some
suppliers to the city wouldn't have to pay the higher rates until
their contracts with the city came up for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a Used Business
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to run my own business, but I think I am better
at managing than creating something from scratch. What are the best
strategies for buying an existing business?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: A lot of people are better at building or buffing up a
venture that already exists than dreaming one up. Often, there also
is a lot less risk adopting a business that's a known quantity.
</P>
<P>
   In her new book ``101 Answers to the Most Frequently Asked
Questions From Entrepreneurs'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $16.95),
Courtney Price provides a useful checklist for buying a business:
</P>
<P>
   _Hire the owner of a similar business outside your competitive
area to help you evaluate purchase opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   _Seek outside help from accountants, lawyers and bankers in
assessing opportunities to purchase a business.
</P>
<P>
   _Ask for audited financial statements and tax returns for the
past three to five years. Also, compare operating ratios with
comparable statistics from Robert Morris studies, and thoroughly
review assets and liabilities including uncollected bills and
pending law suits.
</P>
<P>
   _Run a background check with the Better Business Bureau, Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet or other sources. Also, assess the current staff and
review their personnel files.
</P>
<P>
   _Evaluate the local economic and political conditions.
</P>
<P>
   _Meet with current customers and former customers to gauge their
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   _Present yourself as a fully qualified business person.
</P>
<P>
   _Negotiate with the seller to carry back debt and give you good
terms so that the business generates enough cash to pay for itself
in five years.
</P>
<P>
   _Ask the seller to continue working in the business for three to
six months to help you make the transition and provide training.

 Firms Using Mediation To Avoid Costly Trials
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
When former San Francisco Superior Court Judge Daniel Weinstein
left the bench a decade ago for a new career in alternative dispute
resolution, he said a lot of people didn't know the difference
between mediation and meditation.
</P>
<P>
   Today they do. And Weinstein is at the top of his new profession
after successfully mediating settlements worth &UR;  &LR; a total of about $1
billion last year. They included the $187.5 million settlement of
the giant class-action lawsuit against Bank of America over its
handling of California municipal bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation and arbitration are on the rise as courts become
increasingly clogged and companies, government agencies and
families realize they can save time, money and their nerves by
reaching a settlement outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal courts in Northern California now require that
parties to civil litigation first go through some type of
alternative dispute resolution or ADR.
</P>
<P>
   And many companies stipulate in contracts that if a disagreement
arises, customers or business partners must agree to mediation or
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Cornell University and PricewaterhouseCoopers two
years ago found that 88 percent of the top 1,000 U.S. companies
have used mediation, where parties try to reach compromise through
an independent agent. Seventy-nine percent used arbitration, where
parties agree to present their cases to a private judge or panel
and live by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of this trend, a growing number of judges and
lawyers with an entrepreneurial spirit are starting or joining
mediation firms.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein exemplifies the new breed of legal negotiator. For the
past decade, he has been a lead mediator for JAMS/Endispute, one of
the nation's leading ADR firms. More than 90 percent of the cases
he has mediated have been settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein was recently named along with two European financial
experts to a panel to mediate the $15 billion transfer of Bosnian
government-owned assets to its Croat, Muslim and Serb citizens. And
last Thursday, he received the San Francisco Trial Lawyers
Association's first annual Distinguished Mediator Award.
</P>
<P>
   During his previous 11 years as a municipal and superior court
judge in San Francisco, Weinstein said he most enjoyed handling
settlements rather than presiding over long trials.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein decided to leave the bench in 1989, when the courts
were backed up with asbestos cases and plaintiffs and defendants
were looking for a quicker way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wanted a new product _ a different way to get cases
resolved quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ADR not only promises shorter time to resolution at a much lower
costs, but confidentiality and finality since there usually are no
appeals. The process also focuses more on getting results than
following formal procedures, which is appealing to entrepreneurial
types.
</P>
<P>
   One of Weinstein's biggest mediations has been the BofA case.
There, the state of California and nearly 300 municipal agencies
charged that between 1977 and 1992, the bank diverted to its own
account hundreds of millions of dollars of unclaimed bond payments.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said all sides ``were getting exhausted by the
gargantuan size of the litigation and the prospects that gathering
data, trial and appeals would go on for years.'' In addition,
NationsBank recently had agreed to buy BofA and wanted a clean
slate.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein was chosen because he was acceptable to all sides in
the dispute. These included the defendant, Bank of America;
plaintiffs, the state of California and the city of San Francisco,
which represented thousands of municipal bond issuers; and former
BofA employee Pat Stull, who filed the class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   While Weinstein dealt with the legal issues, two other
independent and unbiased experts approved by all sides were hired
to analyze the numbers: University of California at Berkeley
Economics Professor Daniel McFadden and UC Davis Management
Professor Michael Maher.
</P>
<P>
   McFadden said Weinstein explained that ``the first job in
mediation is to get the parties to change their thinking from `I'm
right, you're wrong''' to an understanding of the other side's
position and the odds of losing.
</P>
<P>
   After the two professors spent about a week gathering and
evaluating evidence, Weinstein figured it could take two or three
months of mediation to reach a settlement. Instead, he was able to
resolve the dispute after two long days last November.
</P>
<P>
   The first day was for presentations, which involved so many
experts and attorneys from all sides that they needed a conference
room at the Union Square Hyatt. The next day, Weinstein put the
different parties in separate rooms at JAMS/Endispute's 11th floor
offices in Embarcadero Center No. 2 and shuttled between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weinstein was helpful on several levels,'' said San Francisco
Chief Trial Deputy Pat Mahoney, who attended the marathon sessions
with City Attorney Louise Renne. ``He brought in independent
experts for the complex analysis of damages. He understood the
issues and the interests of each parties. And he had a sense of
humor, which created an environment where mediation could move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, at about 6 p.m. on the second day, with the parties
still far apart on a dollar settlement, Mahoney recalls that
Weinstein referred to himself as ``a rug merchant'' and he would be
happy to convey any price although he doubted it was the best price
to make a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Around 11 p.m., with Renne missing a San Francisco opera
performance for the higher financial drama, the $187.5 million deal
with BofA, the state and cities was struck.
</P>
<P>
   McFadden came away impressed not only with Weinstein`s skill at
``humoring, cajoling, and bullying'' the participants but also the
mediation process. ``It promotes truth finding by giving each party
an opportunity to gain perspective on the merits of its own case
and obviously avoids the risks of trial judgments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But to be successful, McFadden observes certain necessary
preconditions. Namely, each side needs to be predisposed to settle
and have sufficient data so neutral experts can evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   As the BofA case was ending, Weinstein, the son of a rabbi, was
one of three persons appointed by the Privatization Monitoring
Commission to oversee the privatization of Bosnia-Herzegovina's
economic assets as part of the Dayton Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
   With 60 percent of the population displaced since 1991 and
ethnic rivalries running rife inside Bosnia and neighboring
Yugoslav states, Weinstein said the issues couldn't be more
complex.
</P>
<P>
   But he is excited by the challenge even though the pay is far
below the usual $7,500 per diem he and other top neutrals receive
for helping defuse legal powder kegs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to BofA and Bosnia, Weinstein has handled consumer
class-action cases involving credit cards and life insurance;
personal injury and medical claims cases including contaminated
blood products; and environmental cases such as current
contamination claims at San Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   He also has mediated intellectual property cases involving
Apple, Motorola, Intel and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to be a big company to benefit from ADR. The
nation's oldest and largest ADR firm, the American Arbitration
Association, has about 18,000 part-time mediators and arbitrators
who dealt with 95,000 cases last year.
</P>
<P>
   For mediation cases, the filing fee is $150 per party, and the
hourly charge is $190 to $450 an hour, according to Stephen Van
Liere, regional vice president of AAA's San Francisco office. For
arbitration, the filing fee is $500 for settlements up to $10,000.
The fee is $7,000 for cases involving $1 million to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   At JAMS/Endispute, which has about 30 retired judges and five
lawyers in its San Francisco office, the hourly rate is $300 to
$600. The daily charge ranges from $2,500 to $7,500 depending on
the case and the seniority of the mediators.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the national ADR firms, a number of smaller
specialists are listed online and in the Yellow Pages that deal
with business, family and public interest conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Bar Association also makes referrals. Its
Civil Mediation Panel of 40 specialists charges a $100
administration fee plus $150 to $250 an hour.

 Geron Buys Cloning Ability
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Geron Corp., a Menlo Park biotech company, said yesterday that it
has purchased the Scottish firm that owns the technology used to
clone Dolly the sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Geron said control of the Dolly technology could eventually lead
to radical new types of medical treatments, such as growing healthy
cells to graft onto _ and repair _ sick livers or hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly made headlines in 1997 after she became the first cloned
mammal. She was created by a scientist at the Roslin Institute, a
Scottish research outfit, which formed a company, Roslin Bio-Med,
to commercialize the cloning technique.
</P>
<P>
   Geron said it would acquire Roslin Bio-Med for 2.1 million
shares of Geron stock. Wall Street reacted coolly, driving Geron
stock &UR;  &LR; down 13 cents to $12.25, making the deal worth about $26
million at yesterday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very interesting and I'm glad it makes people talk
about biotech,'' said Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical
Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley. ``But I don't see how it makes
anybody any money for years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, the Washington, D.C., trade group, put the news in a
more dramatic light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't usually comment on mergers,'' Feldbaum said. ``But
this is one combination we'll look back on as launching an entirely
new field called regenerative medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Okarma, Geron's vice president for research and
development, said even in the most optimistic circumstances, it
would take three to five years for some of the Dolly technology to
be commercialized.
</P>
<P>
   According to Okarma, Geron hopes to combine cloning with the
advances that earned Geron huge headlines last year _ its patents
on the immortality enzyme and its licensing of human stem cell
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Okarma said Geron's hopes begin with stem cells, a type of cell
harvested from developing embryos. Stem cells, which emerge in the
earliest days after fertilization, are the factories that divide
and differentiate, eventually producing all the cells, from nerves
to blood to muscle, that make us live and breathe, Okarma said.
</P>
<P>
   When the discovery of stem cells was announced in November,
Geron held out the prospect that these cellular factories could one
day be used to create tissues that could be used as transplant
material. But in order to grow large numbers of specialized cells,
Okarma said Geron will need to use its second technology, the
immortalizing enzyme known as telomerase.
</P>
<P>
   In nature, cells have a definite life span. The telomerase
enzyme allows cells to stay alive and keep dividing indefinitely.
Geron got a second blast of publicity in December when scientists
working with the firm published data showing that this immortality
enzyme allowed tissue cultures to grow almost endlessly in the
laboratory _ without turning into dangerous cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Even before yesterday's announcement, Geron said that by adding
telomerase to cultures of differentiated stem cells, it hoped to
one day grow large batches of skin, lung, heart and other cells.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Okarma explained, the acquisition of the cloning
technology should allow Geron to do something new with its cellular
factories, that is turn them into customized assembly lines. It
would do this by taking the nucleus out of a cell from a patient's
body, and injecting it into the cell factory so that the tissues
produced are biologically identical to the tissues in the patient's
body.
</P>
<P>
   If this can be done, he said, it would solve the biggest problem
in organ transplant medicine: Patients often reject their new
hearts or livers, perceiving them as infectious agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could maintain a large vat of reprogrammed cells to create
your heart muscle cells or my heart cells,'' Okarma said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea would not be to grow replacement hearts or livers, he
said. Rather, the aim would be to grow healthy cells, cloned to be
identical to the cells in the patient's body. These cultured cells
could be grafted onto the damaged organ, he said, in the same way
someone might iron on a patch to mend pants.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Pedersen, a professor of reproductive sciences at the
University of California at San Francisco, sounded the same theme
in an article in April's Scientific American. Pedersen, a member of
Geron's scientific advisory board, was out of the country yesterday
and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But his article says scientists already have all the tools they
need to one day perform the types of cell grafts Okarma talked
about. ``This scenario is for now hypothetical, but it is not
farfetched,'' Pedersen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The cell graft technique is just one of the possible advances
Okarma said could grow out of the Dolly deal. In the meantime,
Geron hopes to earn money in more mundane ways, such as creating
tissue cultures that drug companies can use as test beds for
prospective remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Robbins-Roth, a biotech industry analyst in San Mateo,
said Geron has proven adept at garnering attention for its novel
and provocative approaches to biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to keep in mind is that can take a decade or more
for some of these promising ideas to turn into products that are
clinically or commercially viable,'' she said.

AT&AMP;T, CLOSE TO GETTING MEDIAONE, SEEN FORGING MICROSOFT LINK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. is close to forming a wide-ranging partnership with
Microsoft Corp. as part of an intricate web of deals that has put
AT&AMP;T on the verge of winning the battle against Comcast Corp. for
MediaOne Group Inc., the big cable television company, executives
close to the negotiations said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast, whose initial $53 billion bid for MediaOne was topped
by an AT&AMP;T offer of $58 billion, has agreed to accept a two-part
consolation settlement in which it will end up with as many as 2
million of AT&AMP;T's existing cable subscribers, mostly on the East
Coast, for up to $9 billion, the executives said. It will also
assume management control over an additional 2 million AT&AMP;T cable
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies could announce the deals as soon as Wednesday, the
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after selling up to 2 million subscribers to Comcast, AT&AMP;T,
the nation's biggest telephone company, would emerge from the fray
as the nation's biggest cable television company. Before agreeing
to acquire Tele-Communications Inc. for about $32 billion last
summer, AT&AMP;T had no presence in cable television. But C. Michael
Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman of 18 months, is pursuing a vision of
delivering integrated packages of telephone, television and
high-speed Internet access to millions of households using cable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast, its ambitions for MediaOne apparently dashed, will
still end up the No. 3 cable television company. The residential
customers it is set to buy from AT&AMP;T will serve to solidify
Comcast's dominance between Philadelphia and Washington, executives
close to the talks said. They added that AT&AMP;T and Comcast would
form a venture to offer telephone service over Comcast's cables.
</P>
<P>
   But the most intriguing and potentially important element of the
numerous deals is the partnership that AT&AMP;T is negotiating with
Microsoft, the No. 1 maker of personal computer software. Together,
AT&AMP;T and Microsoft have a market value of more than half a trillion
dollars and, if linked, would form the world's leading force in
technology and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Any AT&AMP;T-Microsoft partnership would be sure to rouse concern
among politicians and regulators. Though the two companies are not
now competitors, both AT&AMP;T and Microsoft are behemoths with long
traditions of dominating their industries. The prospect of an
alliance is sure to seem mind-boggling to at least some powerful
people in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   William Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, declined to comment Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal being negotiated Tuesday night,
Microsoft would invest about $5 billion in AT&AMP;T to acquire 2 to 3
percent of the communications giant, executives close to the talks
said. Microsoft would pay more than the closing price of AT&AMP;T
shares Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, the executives said.
They added that the size of the premium to be paid was one of the
central sticking points in the negotiations Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   While AT&AMP;T does not need the money, an investment from Microsoft
would buoy AT&AMP;T's shares, which may fall as the company continues
its headlong deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   As for Microsoft, it would get what it has long been seeking: a
commitment from AT&AMP;T to use Microsoft's Windows operating system in
the advanced set-top boxes that AT&AMP;T will deploy to offer bundles
of digital services.
</P>
<P>
   With $22 billion in cash and no debt _ and already owning 11
percent of Comcast _ Microsoft finds itself in a kingmaker role in
the deal, choosing sides or threatening to bid for MediaOne on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   An investment in AT&AMP;T would be partly defensive for Microsoft.
The company has scrambled for advantage for Windows CE _ the
version of its operating system for small devices _ in the young,
fast-changing market for software used in television set-top boxes.
And Microsoft also wants to try to insure access to high-speed
networks for its other software and Internet commerce businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's move would also be offensive in that it could
help the company as the Internet business moves toward the
so-called broadband model in which households are continuously
connected to high-speed data lines.
</P>
<P>
   Though Comcast has agreed to drop out of the bidding for
MediaOne, it will walk away with a rich prize, analysts said
Tuesday. At a price of up to $9 billion in cash and stock for as
many as 2 million cable subscribers, Comcast is paying roughly
$4,500 a subscriber, about the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast, based in Philadelphia, will swap another 700,000
subscribers to give it more clustered subscribers in crucial
markets. Though only half of the exact locations for cable swaps
and purchases had been determined late Tuesday night, a person
involved in the discussions said Comcast was increasing cable
subscribers in some of its main markets, including Philadelphia,
Nashville, Tenn., and parts of Michigan, and giving up some in
Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the subscribers, Comcast will use the $1.5 billion
fee that MediaOne will pay for backing out of the original deal
with Comcast. Comcast is also swapping back to AT&AMP;T $1.5 billion in
AT&AMP;T stock and another $1 billion in the stock of At-Home, a
provider of Internet services over cable modems. Had Comcast sold
that stock on the open market, it would have paid heavy capital
gains taxes. Selling it back to AT&AMP;T is a tax-free transaction,
people close to the company noted Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   To pay the balance of the purchase price, Comcast will issue
additional shares of its own nonvoting stock at a price based on
how the stock trades over the next 50 days. A person close to the
talks said that Comcast expected to add 75 million new shares to
its existing base of 450 million shares.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Comcast clearly wanted MediaOne but was unable to form a bidding
alliance with America Online, which was not in a position to issue
more stock to pay its share because its stock price has been
volatile. Microsoft, another potential ally, decided to cut a deal
with AT&AMP;T, and Comcast did not have the financial muscle to buy the
company on its own.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts who follow Comcast were pleased by the new
deal. For one thing, Comcast will be using its deal-breakup fee of
$1.5 billion, which one analyst called found money. It is also
using a large slug of Comcast stock, which is trading near record
prices. It closed Tuesday at $64.125. And for analysts who believe
that size is less important than clustered systems that enable
cable companies to sell local advertising and have better
management control, Comcast is moving close to that model.
</P>
<P>
   Continued consolidations have reassured investors that cable
companies will be well run and will benefit from economies of
scale.
</P>
<P>
   In a related transaction, AT&AMP;T is buying the half of Lenfest
Communications that it does not already own from that company's
chairman, Jerry Lenfest. The price for the midsize cable company is
$2 billion, or 43 million shares of AT&AMP;T stock.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Roberts, Comcast's president and a member of the family
that controls the company, will manage those cable systems, which
are heavily weighted in New Jersey and Philadelphia, where Comcast
already has cable systems.

 Anti-Impeach Site Moves On to Gun Control
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The Berkeley software entrepreneurs who spearheaded an Internet
petition opposing the impeachment of President Clinton have
launched a new cyber campaign supporting gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In response to this month's massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., Joan Blades and Wes Boyd started an online gun
control drive on their Web site,  &LR; www.moveon.org,  &LR; last Thursday
night. By yesterday, they had gathered more than 42,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Blades and Boyd are the husband-and-wife founders of Berkeley
Systems, a screen saver and computer game company. In September,
they started MoveOn.org as a one-issue grassroots political site.
The site eventually gathered about 500,000 signatures to pressure
members of Congress to censure but not impeach Clinton for the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   MoveOn.org also received about $13 million in pledges for money
to be used in election campaigns next year against House and Senate
members who voted for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Gun Safety First'' campaign promotes the ``common
sense regulation of firearms,'' such as child safety standards for
gun manufacturers and laws forcing gun-show operators to enact
more-stringent background checks on buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another issue where a vast majority of citizens want
reasonable gun control but what's happening inside the Beltway is
not reflecting that desire,'' Blades said. ``This is an opportunity
for people who are concerned to become an effective voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than 1 million online signatures gathered by
MoveOn.org and other political Web sites, Clinton was impeached by
the House, though the Senate did not force the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control is just as contentious an issue for Congress. In the
Columbine High aftermath, Clinton proposed a package of new gun
control laws, some of which have been voted down in Congress
several times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Gun advocacy groups also are using the Internet to lobby
Congress. For example, the Gun Owners of America's site,
 &LR; www.gunowners.org, &LR;  offers already-written e-mail messages
opposing proposed gun control laws and the messages can be sent
automatically to key members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Blades believes that MoveOn.org can be successful because it
pushes a ``moderate'' gun control law that should appease pro-gun
advocates. ``We want to be able to support basic legislation that
keeps guns out of the hands of irresponsible people,'' she said.

 New Mutual Fund Betting That Japan's Economy Is on the Rebound
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The sun also rises, but when?
</P>
<P>
   If you're visionary investor Bill Hambrecht and Asian fund
manager G. Paul Matthews, the answer is: any day now.
</P>
<P>
   While nobody seems to know for sure whether Japan's ruinous
economy has finally bottomed out, Hambrecht and Matthews are
betting that investors can't afford to avoid Japan for much longer.
So, Matthews' international fund complex, in which Hambrecht owns
about a 30 percent stake, is launching a mutual fund targeted at
the world's second largest economy: the Matthews Japan Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is still that question (of whether earnest
economic recovery has begun) in Japan, but when we find the answer
it will be too late to invest,'' says Matthews, who is chief
investment officer of the San Francisco fund complex bearing his
name.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews, a former GT Global fund manager, founded his fund
group in 1991. It consists of Matthews Pacific Tiger Fund, Matthews
Asian Convertible Securities Fund, Matthews Korea Fund and Matthews
Dragon Century Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's Japan's turn. And for those investors with strong
stomachs who like to buy low (and hopefully sell high), now may be
the time to sink some money into the island nation's stock market
through the diversification of his latest mutual fund, Matthews
says.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, there are considerable risks. ``Volatility is a
constant,'' Matthews reminds.
</P>
<P>
   And even if you aren't prepared to plunk down hard-earned cash
on beaten-down Japanese stocks, should you give a rip about the
country's economic health?
</P>
<P>
   Probably. For one thing, so goes Japan _ so goes Asia. Aside
from China, it is really the only Asian economy of any monumental
consequence. And if you've been celebrating the recent blue-chip
rally, the catalyst behind the rebirth of many cyclical stocks has
been a spate of positive rumblings from key foreign markets, such
as Brazil, Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, President Clinton's summit on Monday with Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi spotlighted the impact of Japan's
better-late-than-never economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economic health is critical because American companies
need to sell their oil, chemicals and bulldozers to somebody. And
when Japan's brutal recession caused its industrial base to falter,
many U.S. companies saw their revenues get whacked.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while it is bound to chart a choppy course, a Japanese
recovery of any sort is still welcome news to the U.S. economy and
American investors. What's more, if once-moribund foreign economies
rebound solidly, then it's more likely that investor rotation into
a broader array of stocks may continue. All of which is considered
to be healthy for U.S. financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics will argue that many Japanese companies have yet to
swallow the bitter _ yet essential _ medicine of economic reform
and restructuring, fostering doubts as to whether the worst is
truly over.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Headley, a Matthews portfolio manager, counters by
saying that Japan has managed to initiate more reform than many
people expected it to do, such as wiping bad debt off the books of
banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's correct to say that the government has
nationalized its banking system. It had to bail out the banking
industry, and taxpayers hated doing that,`` Headley says.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Japan's economy improves slowly, ``there are some
tremendous opportunities,'' Headley says. ``The economy has been a
wreck, (but) there are a lot of good companies there that make
great products.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, trust the stock pickers not to simply invest in
Japan Inc., but to find a select group of winners amid the rubble,
says co-manager James Bogin, who has lived off and on in Japan
since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of extended visits recently, Bogin is focusing on
a handful of investment sectors: chain retailing,
telecommunications, manufacturing and financial services. The
following are some companies he is eyeing:
</P>
<P>
   _Hikari Tsushin is a company that sells cellular phone handsets
and contracts for international and domestic long-distance
telephone service. It recently established an internet service
provider, and its profits are growing 30 to 40 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   _Chofu Seisakusho is a manufacturer of water boilers which sells
near the value of its cash on its balance sheet. It is profitable
despite the lousy economy. ``You get the underlying business for
free,'' Bogin says.
</P>
<P>
   _Ralse is a supermarket chain, which has been growing earnings
during the recession. It has figured out how to offer the freshest
produce at low prices, which is a relatively new concept for
Japanese retailing.
</P>
<P>
   _Banks and nonbank lenders. ``The bad news is already built into
many of these stocks,'' Bogin says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Matthews and Hambrecht would be delighted if the
Japan fund could duplicate the success of their Korea Fund. When
Street Smarts first reported that Hambrecht was taking a stake in
the fund complex on September 30, the Korea fund was bottoming out
at about $2 a share.
</P>
<P>
   During the past six months, the Korea Fund has nearly tripled to
$5.94 a share. Of course, Japan's economy is much bigger than that
of South Korea, which means its opportunity for upside may be that
much larger as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Street Smarts runs every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Mark
Veverka can be reached by mail at 901 Mission St., San Francisco,

GORE AND CHERNOMYRDIN, FAMILIAR PARTNERS IN TALKS, SEEK BALKANS
SOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Victor Chernomyrdin, the stolid former Russian
prime minister, and Al Gore, the stolid U.S. vice president, are
engaged in an intensive search for a diplomatic exit to the
bloodshed in the Balkans, an effort that brings some risk to both
men, but potentially large benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two days, Gore and Chernomyrdin conducted a
movable meeting that migrated from Gore's small quarters in the
West Wing of the White House to the Oval Office to the exercise
room of Gore's official residence.
</P>
<P>
   While the sessions were ``constructive,'' the leaders said,
there has been no breakthrough. Aides said that substantive
progress on the diplomatic front would not come for weeks, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men, lifelong party apparatchiks and loyal
lieutenants to more charismatic leaders, do not traffic in
breakthroughs. Their speciality is dialogue; their advanced degrees
are in ``process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Chernomyrdin discussions may in the end yield nothing.
Nevertheless, both men stand to gain from these high-profile
sessions. Should their talks bear fruit, each would be seen as a
peacemaker, an effective negotiator and a credible leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is engaging in a calculated gamble, as well. Failure in
a high-profile diplomatic venture could undercut his argument that
his foreign policy experience makes him uniquely qualified among
all the current candidates for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Gore said there was no conscious effort to position
him as the seeker of peace in the Balkans, in contrast to President
Clinton, the maker of war.
</P>
<P>
   One Gore adviser said that given the hawkish sentiments in the
Democratic Party today, Gore would benefit more from an aggressive
pro-war position. Gore could suffer if he is associated with a
Russian-brokered peace deal that comes to be seen as too easy on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, this adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Chernomyrdin dialogue, first opened six years ago, has
been an invaluable high-level channel for addressing issues that
their bosses do not have time for and their subordinates cannot
deliver on. They are able to conduct talks without the pomp of
summitry or the indecision of staff-level work. And their personal
connection, groomed over years in high office, creates a bond of
trust unrivaled anywhere else in the U.S.-Russia relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no doubt that we have the ability to talk with
one another in total candor and in total confidence that neither is
trying to pull the wool over the other's eyes,'' Gore said in an
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Chernomyrdin have been negotiating partners since early
1993, when Chernomyrdin was the newly appointed Russian prime
minister under President Boris Yeltsin and Gore took office as Bill
Clinton's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 formal sessions of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission on
Economic, Security and Scientific Issues (pretentiously referred to
by Roman numerals, like Super Bowls), the two leaders tackled some
of the thorniest issues dividing the United States and Russia. They
took on Russian missile sales to Iran, lax controls on Russian
weapons-grade plutonium, competition for Russian oil and gas
resources, international loan commitments, and cooperation in space
between the two countries. Their discussions were technical and
detailed, without much bluster, said an aide to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The formal sessions ended when Yeltsin dismissed Chernomyrdin in
March of last year as the Russian economy was imploding, but Gore
maintained informal contacts with his former negotiating partner.
</P>
<P>
   The link was re-established this year when Yeltsin named the
former premier Moscow's special envoy for the Balkans, dramatizing
Russia's interest in aiding its historical ally, Serbia, and
enhancing its own prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Russia strongly opposed NATO's use of force against Yugoslavia
when bombs started falling March 24, provoking one of the deepest
crises in Russia's relationship with the West since the collapse of
the Soviet Union. Moscow has offered itself as a negotiator in hope
of reasserting its influence and international relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was natural to turn to one of the oldest and deepest
ties in U.S.-Russian diplomacy, the Gore-Chernomyrdin channel.
Chernomyrdin was seen as an ideal interlocutor because he did not
have confining governmental responsibilities, but he carried the
full authority of President Yeltsin. He had also earned a
reputation over the years of dealings with the Vice President as
someone who backed up his promises with action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good, very well-established working link with a
very practical side to it,'' said Leon Feurth, Gore's chief foreign
policy adviser. ``Both of the people involved are accustomed to
working out problems with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials who attended the Gore-Chernomyrdin
meetings this week were reluctant to share details of their
discussions. The Americans tried to make clear to Chernomyrdin the
conditions the allies are demanding before they will consider
halting hostilities against Belgrade. Chernomyrdin was relaying
Milosevic's own position, which so far remains wholly unacceptable
to the United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect miracles, U.S. officials cautioned Tuesday. The
talks remain about process, not yet about peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very much a work in progress and very much
uncertain,'' a senior administration official who participated in
the talks said. ``We're not negotiating a peace in the Balkans with
Russia. If we were, we'd be home by now. The problem is Milosevic.
The Russians do not have decisive influence with him, nor do they
claim a decisive influence. But they are trying to help. They are
trying to end this conflict.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday declared parts of
Oklahoma and Kansas disaster areas because of the damage caused by
tornadoes on Monday, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency
sent assistance that included communications equipment and a team
of morticians and medical workers trained in identifying bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whole communities have been leveled,'' Clinton said. ``Homes
and possessions have been turned into splinters and rubble.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's declaration makes residents of the stricken
areas eligible for benefits like low-interest loans to rebuild
their homes, and orders many federal agencies to help in the
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Walker, deputy director of the emergency agency, said a
truck loaded with sophisticated communications equipment had been
sent to Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a communications problem because all the phone lines
are down,'' Walker said, and the truck has satellite phones and
ultrahigh frequency radios that will allow rescuers to reach one
another.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is coordinating the work of 27 federal organizations
and the American Red Cross. One of the organizations, the Public
Health Service, sent a mortuary team from Rockville, Md., to help
deal with the death toll.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross said that it put its emergency shelter
program into effect as soon as the tornadoes hit and that 10
shelters were now set up in Oklahoma, and three in Kansas. Darren
Irby, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said the organization had
advance agreements with schools, churches and other organizations
to use their buildings as emergency shelters to house and feed
disaster victims.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in cases of major loss of life like this one, the
Red Cross sends in teams of mental health workers and condolence
counselors, ``not only to those involved with loss but to emergency
workers and the community at large,'' Irby said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is concerned, he said, that among rescue workers
and residents alike, the tornado disaster may bring on emotional
recollections of the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Five Red Cross emergency response trucks have been activated in
Oklahoma City and seven in Wichita, Kan., Irby said, each capable
of serving up to 5,000 meals a day.

REPORT RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT BIAS IN CRASH INQUIRIES 
</HEADLINE>

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's system for organizing crash
investigations is too dependent on work from groups with direct
interests in the results, including manufacturers, operators and
regulators, a draft report by the RAND Corp. says.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary report, which RAND has been asked to present at
a House budget hearing on Thursday, also found that lengthy
investigations like those involving USAir 427, which lasted for
more than four years, and TWA 800, now two and a half years old,
are becoming the norm, as fewer airplanes crash from simple causes
like navigation error or parts failure. The USAir flight crashed
near Pittsburgh in September 1994, killing 132 people, and the TWA
flight went down off Long Island in July 1996, killing 230.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are rising in each investigation, the report said,
with higher and higher payments in civil suits brought by
survivors, or settlements in suits among airlines, manufacturers
and component producers. Market share and public confidence are
also at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dispassionate fact-finding becomes problematic,'' said notes
by RAND for a briefing to executives on the National Transportation
Safety Board last month.
</P>
<P>
   The board had requested the study last year out of concern over
public criticism of accident investigations, especially air
crashes. Beyond concerns over the length of time investigations
take, families of the dead, and especially their lawyers, are
seeking a greater role in the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Those investigations follow what the board calls its ``party
system,'' under which it invites those with specific expertise to
help it investigate, but not analyze or draw conclusions. For
example, in the case of USAir 427, it had help from the airline,
the pilots' union, Boeing, the company that manufactured a suspect
hydraulic valve and the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia C. Lebow, a RAND analyst who is leading the study, said
in a telephone interview that ``the party process is essential in
many respects because the safety board is never going to be an
enormous agency, and it will never have the staff and the technical
capability to design an aircraft or operate an airline.''
</P>
<P>
   But of the parties, she said, ``you have to recognize that in
this day and age, those guys are coming in with multiple agendas,''
including limiting their legal liability and maintaining public
reputation and market share.
</P>
<P>
   The study recommends that the agency add more experts to its
staff, but also practice ``knowledge management,'' focusing on
where to find outside expertise, from NASA, the Defense Department,
national laboratories or academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, top safety board officials say _ and the study
confirms _ that the agency lacks the resources to keep training its
investigators, as the complexity of airplanes, air traffic control
systems and related equipment advances year by year. In a survey,
40 percent of the investigators told RAND that they get no training
at all, the report said, and average training expenditure per
aviation employee was $2,000 a year, at a time when learning to fly
new models of airplanes could cost $15,000 to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the safety board's staff of about 400
people, of whom about half are investigators, has been ``operating
under continuing excessive workload.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviation investigators told RAND researchers that they work an
average of 51.5 hours a week, not counting periods of intense work
immediately after crashes, when they are in the field from sunup
until sundown, and meet every evening to compare notes.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials say that no matter what the investigators' pay
grade, their overtime is at the time-and-a-half rate of junior
employees, which is sometimes less than their straight-time pay.
Board officials say investigators for other agencies, sometimes
working shoulder-to-shoulder with NTSB investigators, receive
traditional time-and-a-half overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The study said many of the employees were eligible for
retirement, suggesting a looming personnel crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's budget request for the NTSB for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1 is $57 million, which is about equal to
spending in the current fiscal year, including extra funds voted by
Congress for TWA 800 and other special investigations. But the
safety board wants $73 million for overtime and training in fiscal
year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hire smart people, and then we work them hard, and we don't
train them,'' said Peter Goelz, the agency's managing director, in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Goelz said more money would allow the board to once more
complete major crash investigations in 12 to 18 months.

<P>
   DENVER _ In the latest indication that law-enforcement officials
missed early warning signs about the Columbine High School gunmen,
the same sheriff's deputy who investigated their van break-in last
year also took the telephone complaint not long afterward that they
were setting off pipe bombs, a check of records shows.
</P>
<P>
   One week after the deputy, Mark M. Miller, wrote a report on the
pipe bomb complaint, a juvenile-court magistrate granted the two
teen-agers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, a form of probation for
the van break-in. In an interview last week, the magistrate, John
A. DeVita, said he would not have allowed probation had someone
told him of the complaint, which also included information that
Harris had posted three death threats against a classmate on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another indication of a lack of official information
sharing, reports this February by the teen-agers' probation officer
suggested that he, too, had no knowledge of the year-old bomb
complaint, or of a more recent complaint, dated July 19, 1998,
against Harris.
</P>
<P>
   In that later complaint, released by the authorities Tuesday,
Randy Brooks Brown, the father of the threatened classmate, told a
deputy that someone had fired a paint ball pellet through his
garage window, spattering red paint on his cars. Brown, who had
filed the bomb complaint four months earlier, told the deputy ``it
may have been'' Harris, a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the reports by the probation officer this February made no
mention of either complaint, spoke glowingly of both youths and
granted them two months' early termination from the youth diversion
program that had been a condition of their probation for the
break-in.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Office, said that the agency had a computerized database that
cross-referenced files by number, name and address, and that he
could not say why no one had picked up the warning signs waiting to
be added together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the deputy at the time to make the call if he has
enough evidence to put something together,'' Davis said. Referring
to the suburbs around Columbine High, he added, ``There are a
tremendous number of juvenile calls in the South End especially,
vehicles being broke into, criminal mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Miller, who both investigated the van break-in and took
the pipe bomb complaint, he was off duty Tuesday and did not return
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Brown family and some Colorado journalists
have criticized the sheriff's office for not sharing information
about the youths with the prosecutor in the van case, the
magistrate and the probation officer. Chuck Green, a columnist for
The Denver Post, has called on Gov. Bill Owens to investigate the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' Green wrote, ``the sheriff's office shouldn't be
left to investigate itself and declare a verdict that might be seen
as self-serving.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Davis said Tuesday: ``The general consensus here
is, `Bring it on.' We feel everything was handled by the book. We
would welcome anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   New details emerged Tuesday about Mark E. Manes, the 22-year-old
arrested on Monday on suspicion of providing the two young gunmen a
Tec-DC9, a powerful semiautomatic pistol that was one of four
firearms they used in their assault on Columbine High, in
Littleton. Manufacture of the weapon has been barred by federal law
since 1994, although existing guns may be sold among adults _ but
not to minors _ without criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Robert L. Ransome, said Manes bought the weapon at a
gun show near Denver last fall and sold it in late February to one
of the youths. Ransome would not say which boy had bought the gun,
although both were then under 18.
</P>
<P>
   On three occasions in the month before the Columbine killings,
the lawyer said, Manes went up ``into the mountains'' with the two
youths to fire automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark did not know this was going to happen,'' Ransome said of
the Columbine killings. ``When you are up in the woods shooting
with kids, you just think, `Hey, they like weapons.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Manes lives around the corner from Isaiah Shoels, a Columbine
senior who was killed in the high school. His mother, Diann Manes,
is a member of Handgun Control Inc., the nation's largest
gun-control lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been against guns forever,'' Ransome said, waving a
Handgun Control mass-mailing letter addressed to Mrs. Manes. ``Mark
grew up in a house where no weapons were present.''
</P>
<P>
   Manes' arrest on Monday was not his first brush with local law
enforcement. From age 16 to 19, he was cited four times for
under-age drinking. During that time, he was also stopped five
times for traffic violations, once, when he was 17, for trying to
elude a police officer after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   After attending Columbine High for his freshman year and the
first half of his sophomore year, Manes later attended an
alternative high school and a community college, and now works as a
computer programmer. He met Harris and Klebold through a young man
on his street who delivered pizza for the same Blackjack Pizza
outlet where the two teen-agers had after-school jobs as cooks.

   Soeren Laursen, Kjaer's marketing manager, said it had sold
about 100 all-terrain and pickup vehicles in recent years to groups
working in the Balkans. He said the vehicles were stripped-down
models built to ``Africa specifications'' to endure rough
conditions. Some have been modified as ambulances or fitted with
armor and ballistic floor mats to protect occupants if they go over
a land mine.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have just started to get a toehold in the
business. Three years ago, for instance, Schein Pharmaceutical
Inc., a generic-drug producer based in Florham Park, N.J., hired
Allison Formal, a former official with International Services for
Medical Services for Health, a relief group, to help sell drugs to
humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Formal said Schein, in some cases, had given drugs at cost
to relief groups to build up relationships. But typically, the
company charges from 12 to 30 percent above a drug's production
cost, she added. Drugs sold to commercial wholesale buyers
typically cost at least twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies in the disaster market must sell products to
charities at a steep discount because they are competing against
United Nations agencies, which buy huge quantities directly from
manufacturers and pass the savings along.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, sales to humanitarian groups are about 1 percent of
Schein's annual sales, or about $5 million, Ms. Formal said.
</P>
<P>
   Donated medical supplies, which are desperately needed in crises
like Kosovo, can cause their own problems for aid groups. A 1997
article in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated that it
would cost the World Health Organization about $2,000 a ton to
destroy the hundreds of tons of expired drugs and unusable medical
supplies sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina during the conflict there.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a pharmaceutical company must destroy expired drugs in
a hazardous waste incinerator, an expensive form of disposal.
</P>
<P>
   A WHO guideline now calls for donated medical supplies to be no
less than a year away from expiration. But Max Ziv, a pharmacist
working at Genpharm Inc., a generic drug maker in Toronto, said in
a telephone interview that he had been giving charities drugs with
a shelf life of six months.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ziv and Genpharm president Bruce Simpson said they were
unaware of the WHO guideline but defended the practice, saying the
drugs were good. Genpharm is a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, a German
company that is not related to Merck &AMP; Co., the U.S. drug giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a moral issue,'' Ziv said. ``Would you rather see people
in the Third World dying because they need medicines?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, the Vietnamese government burned about 1,000
pounds of expired Genpharm antibiotics and drugs that Ziv had
collected and donated. He said the drugs were no older than six
months from expiration when they reached Vietnam in March.
Government officials destroyed the drugs last fall, according to
news reports.
</P>
<P>
   As the Kosovo crisis continues, some sellers of tents are
apparently seeking to unload products of little use to refugees.
Normally, such products are made by specialized factories, said
Urwin, the buyer with Crown Agents. In recent weeks, he said that
some tent producers that normally did not serve the relief market
tried to sell him expensive tents designed for campers. The
problem: the tents are too small for people to stand inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fine if you are looking to spend a weekend in the
mountains or on the beach,'' Urwin said.
</P>
<P>
   And even products designed for refugees are not always right for
the situation. Addis, the Catholic Relief official, said some of
the tents delivered to Stankovic I, a sprawling refugee camp
outside Skopje, do not have floors because they were produced for
Africa, where it is hot and relatively dry. As a result, the
charity has bought plastic sheeting to serve as tent bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Addis said, his experience with companies in the
disaster business had been good. Not long after surveying the needs
of the 30,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees at the Stankovic camp, he
decided to bring in military-style field kitchens to cook hot meals
for thousands of them at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But when he looked into buying that number of new kitchens,
Addis said he quickly found that the cost was steep and that new
kitchens would take six to eight weeks to get to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   He alerted Spitzfaden of Tri-Med of the problem, and the
procurement company found a surplus dealer that had 22 used NATO
field kitchens. Catholic Relief Service bought the kitchens,
utensils included, for $9,000 each and shipped them immediately to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Tri-Med's markup was, Addis figures he got a deal. It
would have cost him $1 million, about five times what he paid, to
buy 22 new kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we got a good price,'' he said. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
WITH GUMBEL, CBS AIMS TO COMPETE IN THE MORNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ CBS' decision to bring Bryant Gumbel back to morning
television, announced officially on Tuesday, raises the ante in the
competition among network morning programs, an area gaining more
attention from network executives because it offers far more
potential for increased profits than prime time or any other hours
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The network said it was creating an entirely new show to replace
``CBS This Morning'' and investing the most money it had ever spent
on morning television to try to become competitive at an hour when
CBS has never even been a serious ratings contender. It has
consistently finished third among the three network morning shows.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, said the morning was
a part of the day when audiences were growing. ``And there are very
few of those for network television,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel added: ``The skyrocketing production costs and diminished
numbers make prime time a very difficult area to grow profits.
Whereas the morning has been a pretty consistent block in terms of
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gumbel, a new program _ likely to have a new title _ and a
new studio, to be constructed in one of the most visible locations
in Manhattan, the corner of Fifth Avenue and 59th Street,
overlooking the entrance to Central Park, CBS is making a
commitment to compete head to head with General Electric's NBC.
That network's ``Today'' show, by far the dominant show in the
morning, has two entrenched stars in Katie Couric and Matt Lauer
and the prototype of the Manhattan tourist location, its set in
Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had already revamped its morning show ``Good Morning,
America'' in an effort to be more competitive with NBC by bringing
in two of its highest- profile correspondents, Diane Sawyer and
Charles Gibson, and beginning construction on its own
view-on-Manhattan set, on Broadway overlooking Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co., made the move in
January, when ``Good Morning America'' had fallen to its lowest
ratings ever, occasionally even falling into third place behind
CBS. Since the addition of Ms. Sawyer and Gibson, the program has
reversed itself and is currently up more than 20 per cent from that
low point.
</P>
<P>
   ABC announced Ms. Sawyer and Gibson as temporary anchors until a
permanent team was found. But lately the network has emphasized
that this team will be in place for much longer than initially
expected, which was as short as three months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, CBS saw the interim status of the anchors at ``Good
Morning America'' as, in Heyward's words, ``a window of
opportunity.'' He said, ``As long as there is not a permanent plan
in place there, we have a chance to make some gains.''
</P>
<P>
   No one at CBS had more formidable morning credentials than
Gumbel, who was the centerpiece of the ``Today'' show for 15 years.
He left the show to join CBS and host a prime-time magazine show,
but that failed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at going back to the morning as any kind of
comedown,'' Gumbel said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it like somebody who was a Broadway star and then went
and did a movie. And the movie wasn't a big box office smash and so
they decide to go back to Broadway. Does that make them a bomb? I
don't think so. I just think there are some people who are better
suited to Broadway. I love doing live television. I love doing
morning television.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS had struggled so much in morning television that three years
ago it scaled its program back, allowing its affiliated stations to
provide most of the material for the first hour of the program.
Now, Heyward said, the stations will be asked to commit to the
revamped show under Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   It is due to start in November, when the studio will be
complete. CBS still must add a female co-anchor to the program, a
decision Heyward said would be made ``in collaboration with
Bryant.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward did not disclose how much CBS is investing in the new
program but he said published figures, which have been in the range
of $20 million, were of a ``dimension that is essentially
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gumbel's deal, both he and Heyward declined to discuss if
it had been altered from the original $5 million a year contract he
signed when he joined the network. However, one executive familiar
with the terms of Gumbel's agreement said that the financial terms
had not changed because of this shift in assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The new studio will be on the ground floor of the General Motors
building, the same building that houses the FAO Schwarz toy store.
General Motors had used the space for a car showroom.

 U.S. WEIGHS REPATRIATING 2 POWs TO YUGOSLAVIA  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is considering freeing two
Yugoslav prisoners of war as a reciprocal gesture after the release
of three U.S. prisoners over the weekend, NATO and U.S. officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two low-ranking soldiers have been held at a U.S. military
base in Germany since being captured separately last month by
ethnic Albanian rebels who are fighting the Yugoslav army in
Kosovo. The rebels turned the captives over to Albania, which gave
them to the U.S. force in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who left Tuesday on a trip to NATO
headquarters in Brussels and to Germany, asked Defense Secretary
William Cohen to review the prisoners' status, said David Leavy, a
spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said the president had not decided whether to release
them, although a NATO official said their release was expected in a
day or two, possibly during Clinton's visit to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Although the war against Yugoslavia is a NATO operation, the
United States has legal custody of the prisoners and can make a
decision unilaterally, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ordered the three U.S.
soldiers released after meeting the Rev. Jesse Jackson. The three _
Staff Sgts. Andrew Ramirez and Christopher Stone, and Specialist
Steven Gonzales _ were part of a peacekeeping mission in Macedonia
unrelated to the NATO air war. They were captured while on patrol
near the border with Yugoslavia in circumstances that remain
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials had initially played down the idea of a
reciprocal release, fearing that it would seem like bargaining with
Milosevic. One official noted that the Yugoslav prisoners were
involved in the campaign against Kosovo Albanians and that the
Americans were not combatants.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has been eager to contrast the difference in
treatment of the prisoners. As required by the Geneva Conventions,
the International Committee of the Red Cross visited the first
Yugoslav prisoner, who was initially identified as a lieutenant but
is a private, within days of his capture in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is expected to visit the other captive Wednesday.
That prisoner, identified only as an enlisted soldier, was captured
late last week.

<P>
   MIDWEST CITY, Okla. _ The trees, those that are left standing,
have been stripped raw, their splintered limbs left to claw the
sky. Instead of leaves and branches, they carry scraps of
corkscrewed steel, a child's crib, the occasional car.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon Tuesday, the people who lived in a collection
of modest homes known as the Crosby edition were trickling back
into their flattened neighborhood to begin digging out anything
salvageable. For block after block here, there wasn't much left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody all right?'' yelled one woman to the neighbors she
hadn't seen since the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' came the answer. ``We were in the cellar.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these homeless storm survivors exhibited an almost eerie
cheeriness as they pulled out chairs, photos and scraps of
clothing, and loaded their lives into the trunks of cars. But in
their least guarded moments, these victims stand on piles of debris
that used to be home can't seem to manage much more than a blank
stare.
</P>
<P>
   The storm plowed through nearby Del City, skipped across
Interstate 40, and then blasted a swatch about a quarter-mile wide
and two miles long through Midwest City. At least three people died
in this little community, and about 320 homes were either leveled
or so damaged as to be unlivable.
</P>
<P>
   At least 44 people, 38 in Oklahoma, died Monday as twisters
ripped through the region.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the worst devastation, there's a U.S. flag
waving from a makeshift stand in Lena Klepackie's soggy front yard.
A few yards behind it, a little stack of timber and a couple of
sheetrock walls are still standing to mark the hallway where nine
members of Klepackie's family huddled against the killer storm.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a bad week already.
</P>
<P>
   Klepackie's son had died after a heart attack, and her family
was sitting a vigil next to his casket at a nearby funeral home
when the weather warnings were issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back from the viewing to find a safe place for the
kids,'' Klepackie said. They were shoehorned into the small hallway
for nearly a half hour before the tornado roared overhead, and
Klepackie hollered for her family to ``tuck and duck.''
</P>
<P>
   Klepackie theorizes her recently deceased son arranged a little
divine intervention for her family. They found his picture lying on
the floor of the hallway once the storm blew threw.
</P>
<P>
   Klepackie's daughter, Taunya Griffith wasn't sure how to explain
that flag waving stubbornly in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she said. ``I guess to keep us together, you
know, helping each other out. That's what America's about.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks over, Wayne Canfield was rooting through his
elderly parents belongings, looking for family photos and the
things that can't be replaced. The three-bedroom house that Harley
and Minnie Canfield had lived in was gone, though a large chunk of
its flooring had landed on a neighbor's house across the street.
</P>
<P>
   That's where neighbors found the Canfields, buried under debris
but alive and still clinging to that patch of briefly airborne
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Canfield laughed about how stubborn his parents were, and
how they'd resisted moving into a smaller home or apartment. He
pointed to a crumpled mountain of tin cans spilling across their
property, and explained, ``They were getting ready for the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The area is thick with law enforcement officers, positioned on
nearly every corner to guard against looters. Those hardest hit in
Midwest City were having to show proof of identity before being
issued an orange pass that would allow them access past police
lines back into their homes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, those left homeless would be ordered back out.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard is patrolling the blasted commercial strip
that hugs 15th Street along the southern edge of this community as
utility trucks begin the slow job of restoring power. Long lines of
military vehicles were still snaking into Midwest City as nightfall
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Baldwin was walking up and down the street in front of
her flattened house, her jaw jutting out against the unfairness of
it all. She lost her husband about 18 months ago, and now the house
he'd filled with hand-made furniture was gone, too.
</P>
<P>
   She rode out the storm in her hallway also, with pillows
clutched over her head. Her 15-year-old son, Bradley, had been
visiting friends up the street when the storm hit, but came rushing
back to look for his mother in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him say, `Momma, Momma, are you all right? I can't
lose you after losing Daddy,''' Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son asked me (later) how I survived,'' said Baldwin,
nodding to what was left of her house. ``I said, `Don't ask.``
</P>
<P>
   Standing out in the street, shaking her head in frustration, she
said she didn't know what she was going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a beautiful neighborhood,'' she sighed. &QL;

SHARES OF GOLDMAN RISE 33 PERCENT ON FIRST DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. soared on their
first day of trading, making Wall Street's longest holdout its
latest darling.
</P>
<P>
   Trading under the symbol GS on the New York Stock Exchange, the
shares rose $17.375, or 33 percent, from their $53 offering price,
closing at $70.375. Though the stock was well off a high of $77 a
share, investors who bought at the offering price have a paper
windfall considerably larger than the 10 percent to 15 percent
increase many investors hope to receive when a large company like
Goldman first issues shares.
</P>
<P>
   The offering ended Goldman's status as Wall Street's last big
private partnership. It joined the ranks of publicly traded
securities firms more than a decade after the last of its big
competitors issued shares. Goldman ended the day ranked third in
terms of market value, behind Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and
Charles Schwab, and a notch ahead of Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Paulson, Goldman's co-chairman and chief executive, led a
team of Goldman executives on to the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange to ceremonially supervise the first day of trading, and
rang the exchange's opening bell. Some 14,000 employees around the
world then watched on closed-circuit television as the firm's
initial-offering team counted down to the first trade of a Goldman
share, which changed hands at $76 about an hour after the market
opened.
</P>
<P>
   The rise was not as drastic in percentage terms as some initial
offerings by Internet companies. But at $3.7 billion, Goldman's
share sale was the second-largest domestic issue of all time after
Conoco's $4.4 billion initial offering last year. Many new Internet
companies raise a small fraction of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The rise added greatly to the already considerable paper wealth
of Goldman's top executives. Paulson, for example, saw his stake
rise $95 million, to almost $315 million, for the day. Jon S.
Corzine, the co-chairman who lost his executive role in a struggle
with Paulson earlier this year, will leave Goldman later this month
with a $335 million paper nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, employees below the level of partner, down to the
level of janitor and receptionist, were allocated 116 million
shares. If those shares could be sold today _ they are not tradable
for up to five years _ they would be worth $8.12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, of course, earned it pinstripes underwriting stock
issues, and it was not about to fumble its own. Like every company
that goes public, Goldman had an underwriting syndicate. Unlike
most other companies, Goldman micro-managed its own offering: even
the top underwriters were relieved of the burden of finding buyers
for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just handed us a check _ easiest money we ever made,''
the executive of one firm listed as a top underwriter said of its
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The opening was exceptionally smooth. Although about 22 million
shares changed hands during the day, the price was contained within
a relatively narrow range after the opening. One reason was that
Goldman found investors that it expects to hold the shares long
term instead of dumping them when the price spikes temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders hold most of the stock. Goldman sold only 15 percent of
its shares on Tuesday. Most outside investors are prized Goldman
clients, including mutual and pension funds and wealthy private
clients.
</P>
<P>
   The performance was strong despite a slump in financial stocks
generally. Merrill fell $5.5625, to $81.6875, while Morgan Stanley
was off $6.75 at $98.125.
</P>
<P>
   Some market analysts said the resilience of Goldman's offering
on a turbulent trading day suggested that the firm easily could
have raised the price of the shares before trading, earning more
money for the company instead of its investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just shaking my head that this stock could add so many
billions on opening in a sloppy market,'' said Ted Aronson of
Aronson &AMP; Partners, a Philadelphia-based fund manager. ``They left
a lot of money on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman now faces the task of managing itself as a public
company after 130 years as a private one. That means further
opening its cloistered culture to the public.

THE INVASION HAS BEGUN: `STAR WARS' TOY ONSLAUGHT STRIKES
STORES  EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STACK  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toys from the forthcoming movie ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The
Phantom Menace'' arrived in stores Monday and became a force on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The torrent of ``Episode 1'' merchandise _ including dinnerware,
underwear and kids' bikes _ marked the first time any release of
licensed products from a movie had gone nationwide on a specific
target date. Stores across the country opened at midnight Monday
morning in compliance with contracts with ``Phantom Menace''
director George Lucas' Lucasfilm.
</P>
<P>
   The latest plastic good-versus-evil action figures, as well as a
menagerie of creature characters, droids, and space and land
vehicles, provided the first mass glimpse at how Lucas'
much-anticipated film, which opens May 19, will look.
</P>
<P>
   From the get-go, a spiky supervillain named Darth Maul ($10-$40
in various versions) _ essentially the new Darth Vader _ was a hit
with toy buyers. He's a ferocious, punky warrior with horns, a
reddish mottled face and yellow eyes, who wields a double-edged
lightsaber (also new) against Jedi heroes Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan
Kenobi. Their mission in the new film, a ``prequel'' to the first
trilogy, is to protect the beautiful, peace-loving Queen Amidala.
</P>
<P>
   Another instant hit were the toy battle droids, which stand 6
feet 3 in the film. These mechanical figures with equine heads are
shown advancing in a mass platoon in the ``Phantom Menace''
trailers playing at theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the hot new ``Star Wars'' toys:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
VEHICLES
</P>
<P>
   The slick yellow and silver Naboo Royal N-1 Starfighter is a
signature ``Episode 1'' flying machine, piloted by 9-year-old
Anakin Skywalker (the future Darth Vader) with help from R2-D2.
It's best realized in a $29.99 ``electronic'' form from Hasbro that
hums and lights up. Galoob also has a scaled-down version for
$10.99. In addition, Lego, new to Star Wars licensing, issued a
174-piece kit ($19.99) for kids who want to build their own
Starfighters.
</P>
<P>
   Young Anakin proves his Jedi potential in a thrill-ride Pod Race
in the trade-center city of Mos Espa on the planet of Tatooine in
the new film. His Podracer (Hasbro, $29.99), with a sledlike
driving station attached to jets, takes lightning-fast reflexes to
operate in the film and is bound to be a favorite toy. An Anakin
figure is included. Lego's interlocking version sells for $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   The best of several versions of the Naboo Royal Starship, Queen
Amidala's sleek silver personal-transport vessel, is a $25 model by
Estes that either rests on a desktop stand or can be turned into a
flying rocket (rocket kit sold separately) with a flight altitude
of 300 feet (parental guidance recommended).
</P>
<P>
   Trade Federation transport ships are also on store shelves.
Probably the most popular will be the Multi-Troop Transport (MTT),
a cumbersome, utilitarian vehicle. Galoob's version sells for
$10.99.
</P>
<P>
   The reddish-pink Jedi Transport named Radiant VII is an unarmed
diplomatic vessel _ and a cool-looking toy. Other new vehicles are
the menacing Sith Infiltrator (Lego's version is $29.99) and a dark
Gungan sub that transports friendly creature Jar Jar Binks and
heroes Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to the Naboo city of Theed. There are
also Trade Federation Droid Fighters that can go from flight mode
to walking mode, and Trade Federation Armored Attack tanks piloted
by battle droids.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CHARACTERS
</P>
<P>
   In the forthcoming movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi (portrayed in the new
movie by Ewan McGregor) is a Jedi knight apprentice. His mentor in
using the Force and in lightsaber techniques is Jedi master Qui-Gon
Jinn (Liam Neeson). They discover a promising young Jedi in a
Tatooine slave named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). On the small,
peaceful planet of Naboo, all undertake a mission to protect young
Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) from evil. Mace Windu (Samuel L.
Jackson) is a senior Jedi Master and member of the Jedi Council, as
is the much-respected Yoda _ but Yoda is younger in ``Episode 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Action figures (most from Hasbro) representing almost all the
characters are the biggest sellers already and easily the most
accessible, since they cost $10 or less.
</P>
<P>
   A new gadget called a COMMtech Reader ensures their popularity _
the $21.99 device enables the action figures to talk to one
another. Each Hasbro figure comes with a ``dialogue chip'' that has
four lines of dialogue implanted in it. Insert the chip into the
figure, power up the reader (batteries sold separately) and a
control panel allows the figure to speak phrases.
</P>
<P>
   C-3PO is represented among action figures as an unfinished
bundle of wires, since ``Episode 1'' precedes the familiar ``Star
Wars'' stories. He was originally just a protocol droid, according
to the toy's packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Bad guys represented by action figures include Darth Sidious, a
lord of darkness who orders evil Darth Maul to ``wipe them out, all
of them'' on Naboo.
</P>
<P>
   Bad creatures include Neimoidians and their viceroy, Nute
Gunray, who help to carry out a Sith Lord's destructive orders. A
Sando Aqua Monster, Opee Sea Killer and Colo Claw Fish are also
ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   Gungans, a race of amphibians living on planet Naboo, speak a
strange fractured dialect (picked up by the COMMtech Reader). A
crowd-pleasing creature is a googly-eyed critter named Jar Jar who
helps out the Jedi heroes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WEAPONS
</P>
<P>
   The big items here are lightsabers, and easily the most
interesting new one is Darth Maul's double-edged model (Hasbro,
$29.99), which emits an ``energy hum,'' lights up on contact and is
expandable to five feet, tip to tip.

DISNEY CHAIRMAN TESTIFIES IN FORMER AIDE'S FRAUD SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The chairman of Walt Disney Co., Michael Eisner,
testifying Tuesday for the first time in the lawsuit by his former
studio chief, Jeffrey Katzenberg, disputed Katzenberg's contention
that Disney owes him hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also came under intense questioning from Katzenberg's
lawyer about harsh personal remarks he had made about Katzenberg as
well as a comment to his biographer that he hated his former studio
chief.
</P>
<P>
   After acknowledging that he had said this, Eisner added: ``I did
not hate Katzenberg. I do not hate Katzenberg.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came in Katzenberg's fraud and breach-of-contract
suit against Walt Disney. Katzenberg has insisted that Disney owes
him at least $250 million. The former studio chief, who worked with
Eisner for more than a decade, contends he is owed a bonus on all
future profits of Disney movies made while he was at the studio.
Disney had agreed to a settlement, but nothing close to $250
million.
</P>
<P>
   With Katzenberg staring intently at his former boss, Eisner said
that Katzenberg had agreed to forfeit a substantial bonus if he
left the company before his contract expired. Eisner said that
Katzenberg, in one of their conversations, seemed unconcerned about
the huge bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of those conversations he had that flip attitude,''
Eisner said. The Disney chairman said that Katzenberg told him,
``I'm not going to exercise that so don't worry. I have to have it
for my comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Eisner said he told Katzenberg that he was
going to lose $100 million in compensation if he left the company
early. Eisner said, ``He acknowledged he was leaving $100 million
on the table and on one occasion he said, `It's no big deal. I'll
get that back in no amount of time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his relationship with Katzenberg _ which is now
severed _ Eisner said that he did not have ``major
misunderstandings or major angst,'' but there may have been one or
two contentious conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going to the dentist,'' Eisner said. ``You forget
the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing grew somewhat lively in midafternoon when
Katzenberg's attorney, Bert Fields, embarrassed Eisner by referring
to unpublished notes from his autobiography, ``Work in Progress,''
published last year. The notes were taken by Eisner's ghostwriter,
Tony Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Fields asked Eisner if he recalled saying that Katzenberg was
``the pom-pom'' spurring Disney's success, and on another occasion
saying of the studio executive, ``I think I hate the little
midget.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner told Fields that the comments were completely private,
and occurred in the course of hundreds of hours of interviews and
never appeared in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pursue this line of questioning,'' Eisner told Fields,
``it will put in the public record things which I do not think
deserve to be in the public record.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner avoided gazing at Katzenberg, who sat with his wife,
Marilyn, only several feet away. Instead, Eisner focused his
attention on Katzenberg's lawyer, Fields, who represents numerous
film and television stars.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg left Disney studios in anger in 1994 when Eisner
failed to promote him to the No. 2 job, following the death of
Frank Wells, Disney's president, in a helicopter crash. Two years
later, after unsuccessfully seeking an incentive bonus that he said
was owed to him, Katzenberg sued Disney for at least $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg said that the bonus entitled him to 2 percent of the
profits from the films and television shows _ as well as the
merchandising from those films _that were put into production
during the 10 years he ran Disney studios. In November 1997, Disney
and Katzenberg announced a settlement, essentially saying that the
former studio chief was due some bonus money. But the two sides
have failed to reach any agreement on the exact sum. Last week
Michael Ovitz, the former Disney president, had suggested a
compromise of about $100 million, but Eisner refused.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Eisner acknowledged that he told his biographer, in
unpublished notes, that he would not give Katzenberg any money.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner acknowledged that when Disney agreed in 1984 that
Katzenberg would get a bonus, it was relatively meaningless. ``The
residual value of the films were very minor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this changed after 1988 when Disney began releasing its
lucrative animated films like ``Little Mermaid,'' ``Beauty and the
Beast,'' ``Aladdin'' and ``The Lion King.'' These films, as well as
a number of children's movies made while Katzenberg ran the studio,
reaped huge sums in merchandising and other spinoffs as well as
video sales.

ESPN SUES BASEBALL OVER SUNDAY NIGHT TELECASTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ESPN asked a federal judge Tuesday to halt Major
League Baseball's termination of their contract after this season
over the cable giant's plan to shift three Sunday night games in
September from ESPN to ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed with U.S. District Court in Manhattan, ESPN said
that it has made numerous efforts over the past year to make the
switch to ESPN2 more palatable to baseball but that all were
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   It appears no offer could salve baseball's psychic wound: ESPN
wanted to replace the three September games with higher-rated
National Football League telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit, ESPN said that baseball had conditioned its
acceptance of the shift to ESPN2 on receiving an additional $350
million in regular season payments through 2002, more than 300
percent above current rights fees, plus a contractual extension
through 2004 and other concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disproportionate and out of whack,'' said Dick Glover, an
executive vice president of ESPN. ``This is about three games out
of 500 hours of baseball programming each year.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is seeking to enjoin baseball's termination of the contract
and unspecified monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ESPN's NFL games generated an 8.1 Nielsen cable
rating, as against 1.8 for baseball. The three NFL games that aired
in place of baseball averaged a 7.3 rating. In 1997, when ESPN
carried the three Sunday night baseball games in September, the
rating averaged 1.7.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Levin, a spokesman for baseball, declined to argue whether
the deal's termination fit ESPN's alleged breach. He said: ``The
bottom line is they broke the contract. We had hoped we could
resolve this.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball notified ESPN on April 21 that it was terminating its
contract after more than a year of negotiations. Baseball felt
aggrieved in January 1998 when ESPN made a $600 million-a-year deal
with the NFL for full seasons of Sunday night games and was not
consulted in advance about the impact on its Sunday night baseball
telecasts. Until then, ESPN showed the football season's second
half, after TNT carried the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the NFL games by ESPN meant pitting its first
three Sunday night games against the last three Sunday night
baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   To ESPN, the remedy was easy: shift the baseball games to ESPN2
because they rate lower than NFL telecasts and cost about $40
million a year for the regular season. (The dispute does not cover
ESPN's separate contract through 2000 to carry baseball playoff
games.)
</P>
<P>
   Baseball disagreed, and last August it stripped ESPN of the
right to carry the three Sunday night games in September, thus
preventing their showing on ESPN2. ESPN is available in 76.6
million cable households; ESPN2 in 64.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essential issue is baseball's unwillingness to acquiesce
to a second-banana role behind the NFL,'' said Neal Pilson, an
industry consultant. ``Baseball is saying, if ESPN2 is so great why
not put the NFL there?''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN believes the contract with baseball clearly spells out its
rights to shift games to ESPN2 ``for events of significant viewer
interest.'' In eight years, ESPN has pre-empted baseball 15 times,
but only on Wednesday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the deal was negotiated, the issue was never about time
of year or day of week,'' said Glover, the ESPN executive.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, baseball has granted pre-emptions for events like a
Busch Grand National auto race, taped golf highlights and the
College World Series. But none of those pre-emptions were granted
for Sunday night games in September.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball regards the ESPN Sunday night games as a key showcase,
because the telecasts are carried exclusively, with no other games
played against them.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute threatens to shatter the productive ESPN-baseball
relationship, now in its 10th season.
</P>
<P>
   Glover said he felt betrayed by baseball's action, saying ESPN
stood by the sport in tougher times and did not demand a full
refund for unplayed games during the 1994 strike ``because they
said they were strapped for cash.''
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of the past relationship seemed to fade Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, the baseball spokesman, said that ESPN's rationale in
moving the Sunday night baseball games is in error, that an NFL
game is not an ``event of significant viewer interest'' as
envisioned by the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says says nothing about ratings,'' Levin said. ``Just
because something gets higher ratings doesn't mean it's an event of
significant viewer interest.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There's very little we would approve to pre-empt
Sunday night games for. But it wouldn't be for early-season
football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover said there was no way to measure viewer interest without
using ratings as the primary gauge.

REGION'S BOOMING TECH FIRMS LURE SILICON BANK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ Silicon Valley Bank, one of the top
lenders to California start-ups, said Tuesday that it has opened a
branch in Westlake Village, northwest of Los Angeles, to service
technology firms along the Ventura Freeway corridor.
</P>
<P>
   The office is the Santa Clara-based bank's fourth in Southern
California and will service firms from Burbank to Goleta in Santa
Barbara County, the company said. Other Silicon Valley branches are
located in Irvine, West Los Angeles and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impetus here is to get staff closer to our clients,'' said
Terry Bess, a senior vice president who will oversee the new
office. Bess said the bank already has about 35 clients in the
region who previously had been serviced by the bank's Orange County
and West Los Angeles branches.
</P>
<P>
   Industry participants say the new branch reflects a heating up
of the region's technology-driven economy. ``The bottom line is
that people think there's an opportunity here,'' said Cliff Numark,
program director at the Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance.
``The 101 corridor has a reputation that is quickly developing, so
the location makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bess said most of the bank's lending will be to start-up
companies wanting to expand with loans typically between $500,000
and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bank lending, LARTA released a study in December
that found venture capital is flowing into the region faster than
ever, with spending up 290 percent since 1995, to more than $722
million invested in Greater Los Angeles annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all just another sign about where the region is headed,''
Numark said.

ANNAN PLANS RELIEF MISSION FOR YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Tuesday
that he intended to send a mission to Yugoslavia to assess relief
needs, but faced immediate skepticism from the United States and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs,
Sergio Vieira de Mello, wrote Tuesday to the Yugoslav
representative here to request permission for the team to enter the
country. U.N. relief agencies have not been in Kosovo since shortly
after the NATO bombing began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Such a mission, Annan told reporters, would enable the United
Nations to ``prepare the ground for the refugees to go back to
Kosovo'' after there is an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But American and Russian officials complained that they had not
had a chance to study the proposal and blocked Security Council
endorsement for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining about a lack of coordination between Washington and
Annan's office, American officials said they had learned about the
statement minutes before Annan briefed the council. They said they
were uncertain whether the safety of such a team could be assured
in view of the bombing, which they said would not be interrupted to
ease the team's work.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official said Washington would have to study
the proposal to ensure, among other factors, that sending a team
would not suggest that NATO was willing to suspend the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Annan spoke to reporters after having briefed the 15-member
Security Council on his talks in Germany and Russia and, Tuesday,
with the special Russian envoy on the Balkans, Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the talks in Berlin and Moscow, Annan said, he felt
that there was general agreement on the basic issues, that is the
``withdrawal of Yugoslav forces,'' both militia and police, from
Kosovo and the need for the refugees to be able to return ``in a
secure environment assured by a presence of international force.''
</P>
<P>
   Still at issue, he added, is ``how do we get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there seems to be a consensus on the need for an
international force in Kosovo, there is no agreement, Annan said,
on ``the composition, nature and strength of the force'' and on the
extent of the Serbian withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said if Yugoslavia agreed to accept the mission,
a team that represented at least 10 agencies could leave as early
as Saturday. They plan to survey all the provinces of Yugoslavia,
starting in Kosovo, in 10 days, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and American officials expressed uneasiness about the
mission. The Russian representative to the United Nations, Sergey
Lavrov, said the objections of two council members to the proposed
wording of the announcement kept the council president from
including any endorsement of the proposal in his summary of the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lavrov did not clarify his specific objections,
American officials strongly criticized the lack of coordination
between Annan's office and the United States on the Kosovo crisis
and on other actions.
</P>
<P>
   American officials were widely known to be displeased, for
instance, with a statement that Annan made on Wednesday in Berlin
that deplored the loss of life as a result of the Kosovo conflict.
After meeting Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, Annan said that although ``we've all
been consumed with the tragedy of the Kosovo Albanians,'' the
``negative impact'' of the crisis was ``spreading through the
subregion.''

CLINTON LEAVES FOR EUROPE AS NATO FORCES POUND YUGOSLAV POSITIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
and GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As bombers pounded Yugoslavia and Republicans
rhetorically pummeled the White House, President Clinton departed
Tuesday for Europe to meet with NATO officials, the freed U.S.
soldiers and Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   For a second day, Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin met with
Vice President Al Gore as Moscow's former prime minister sought a
diplomatic solution to the NATO air campaign against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's Serbian forces. Still, there was no
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot see what we have seen with our own eyes and take
refuge in the false comfort of indifference of impatience. We have
to take a stance. We have done that. We have to see our effort
through. We will do that,'' Clinton told reporters as he left the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke hours after NATO forces intensified their campaign
against ground troops in Kosovo and after the Senate, under intense
White House lobbying, shelved a war resolution that would have
given Clinton broad power to initiate a ground invasion of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States is prepared to lose a war
rather than do the hard work, the politically risky work, of
fighting it as the leader of the greatest nation on earth should
fight when our interests and our values are imperiled,'' the
resolution's sponsor, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., asserted in a
speech that also was bitterly critical of Republican and Democratic
senators who voted to table his resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the president reaffirmed his commitment to continue
the bombing until Milosevic withdraws his forces from Kosovo,
allows the Kosovar refugees to return home under the protection of
international security force, and accepts self-government for
Kosovo's predominantly ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin met for 45 minutes with Gore, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and national security adviser Sandy Berger at
the vice president's residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States, NATO countries and Russia are moving closer
to a common set of objectives and a common understanding of the
rationale for those objectives, and hopefully, at some point, a
common plan for implementing those objectives,'' said State
Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said at his meeting Monday with Chernomyrdin that he
``reaffirmed our support for (Chernomyrdin's) efforts and our
willingness to seize every diplomatic possibility for Serbian
authorities to meet the requirements that NATO has articulated.''
Clinton broached the possibility of a pause in the bombing if
Milosevic showed signs of accepting NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
   The president will meet Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium, with
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and NATP Supreme Commander
Gen. Wesley Clark to discuss the progress in the North American
Treaty Organization's air campaign. Clinton said he will meet with
the pilots based in Spangleheim Air Base, Germany, and visit
humanitarian relief operations at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. He
also will meet with the three Americans captured by Yugoslav troops
and released this weekend to the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our men and women in uniform are doing their jobs with
uncommon courage and skill. They have the support of the American
people. They should hear unqualified support from their leaders in
Washington,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the president will meet with German Chancellor
Gerhardt Schroeder and hear first-hand stories from Kosovar
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will assure them of our determination and resolve to see
them returned with security and self-government,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will meet the first planeload
of an expected 20,000 Kosovar Albanians being flown to New Jersey
for a temporary safe haven. The United States and European nations
are taking in some of the 600,000 ethnic Albanians forced out of
Kosovo by Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
   On the military front, clearing weather allowed NATO to fly 600
sorties against 80 targets Tuesday as the European alliance
sharpened and stepped up its attacks against Serb military targets
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reported that a U.S. F-16 fighter downed a Yugoslav
MiG-29 in a dogfight while NATO bombers destroyed another MiG-29
and a Super Galeb attack plane on the ground. The Yugoslav Air
Force has only four Russian-made MiG-29s left of the original 15
jets it had before the bombing began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces also are taking a toll on Milosevic's armor and
soldiers, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say probably 25 percent of his tanks, armored
personnel carriers and trucks were destroyed in Kosovo,'' said U.S.
Air Force Gen. Charles Wald, estimating 16 tanks and personnel
carriers were destroyed in overnight raids Tuesday. He said
American B-52s also dropped 54 500-pound bombs on Serb ground
troops during the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the talk of increasing success from U.S. military
leaders, a divided Congress continued to question whether an air
campaign alone can stop Milosevic's plan to purge Kosovo of its
ethnic Albanian population, which accounts for more than 90 percent
of the Yugoslav province's citizens.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for example, said the United States and its NATO allies
``are not winning this conflict'' because Clinton refuses thus far
to commit NATO ground troops to battle against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the president is losing this war,'' McCain, a
candidate for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination, said in
a CNN interview, ``because Milosevic is continuing his ethnic
cleansing and ... we are unable to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain sought to force the president's hand on ground troops
with his resolution calling for use of ``all necessary force and
other means'' to bring the war to a quick end.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate shelved the measure by a vote of 78-22, with only
13 Democrats and nine Republicans supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and members of his Cabinet have joined with the
opponents of the war and lobbied hard for the resolution's
defeat,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, McCain called it ``indefensible'' for Clinton
repeatedly to rule out the use of ground troops, and said the
president's reluctance had only emboldened Milosevic to escalate
his bloody campaign against Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a fact of this war that is undeniable. And shame on
the president for creating it,'' McCain told his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh comments drew a sharp response from House Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who said it was ``unfair and
inaccurate'' to attack the president ``in this way.'' He expressed
outrage at the treatment McCain and other Republicans were giving
Clinton, noting that no other American president he was aware of
had ever had to endure such criticism from lawmakers that Clinton
has while U.S. forces are engaged in hostilities abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has not asked for this authority, nor have his
military advisers,'' Daschle told his colleagues. ``The air
campaign is working. This is not a matter of lack of courage, this
is not a matter of lack of resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continues to draw support from public opinion polls
showing that 58 percent of Americans prefer the president's tactic
for now.

EARNINGS ANTICIPATION BOOSTS FHS STOCK 9.9 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in first graf refers to Wednesday.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in managed care specialist Foundation
Health Systems Inc. rose nearly 10 percent Tuesday on anticipation
of improved quarterly earnings due out today.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation stock gained $1.375, or 9.9 percent, to close at
$15.25, on volume of 1.27 million shares or roughly three times its
30-day average trading volume. Tuesday's close was the stock's
highest this year.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation is expected this morning to announce earnings of
approximately $28 million, or 23 cents per share, compared with 22
cents per share in the like period one year ago. Though
year-on-year not much of a gain, the earnings are a clear
improvement over Foundation's recent quarterly performance. The
company lost $104 million in the last quarter of 1998, for an
annual loss of $164 million.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that stemmed from the poor performance of the company's
Medicare contracts in the northeast United States. In several
counties, Foundation subsidiaries spent more providing care to
elderly members than they were paid by the government. Analysts say
they are looking for news of a turnaround in that sector in the
company's conference call today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a turnaround in the Northeast, a lot of the other
issues become secondary or tertiary,'' said analyst Robert Hoehn at
ING Baring Furman Selzs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among those secondary concerns is Foundation's high debt load.
The company owes creditors more than $1 billion stemming from its
rapid growth through the purchase of competitors over the last
decade.

TRADE GROUP PARALYZED BY LEADERSHIP DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The diplomatic struggle over who should be the next
head of the World Trade Organization continued unabated Tuesday
while most work at the global trade forum seemed to grind to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   After putting off deliberations for a day, the chairman of the
search team jolted delegates at a meeting Tuesday by declaring that
the candidacy of Suphachai Panichpakdi of Thailand was over and
that the group should consider only his rival, Michael Moore of New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Ali Mchumo, Tanzania's trade delegate, set
forth vigorous protests from Suphachai's supporters, led by Asian
countries, as the meeting stretched late into the evening with no
final decision. Delegates will meet again, after taking ``time for
reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Suphachai declared that he was
``confident of the outcome'' but criticized the selection process
as taking too long. ``I won't say that I feel cheated, but a number
of countries seem to feel the whole process was not consistent,''
he said. In Thailand, where Suphachai is a deputy prime minister,
there has been an outcry against the United States, which was seen
as the chief obstacle to his winning the international post.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of reviewing four initial candidates, the field
was winnowed to the two recent candidates. Mchumo, who heads the
trade organization's decision-making General Council, announced on
Friday that Moore had edged out Suphachai, by a vote of 62-59,
among the members and should be nominated as the new
director-general.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings over the weekend, some vitriolic, among envoys of the
134-nation trade forum failed to come up with a choice or even
agree on a method of proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Mchumo urged the delegates to wrap up the selection or, he said,
``we shall see the intensification of the already unhealthy
divisiveness, recrimination, mistrust and erosion of friendships
which has already taken its toll.''
</P>
<P>
   However, when he declared that the process was over for
Suphachai, representatives of two dozen countries took to the floor
to disagree and to argue that the race was too close to count him
out. Kenya's envoy proposed that Mchumo sound out delegates on
Suphachai's acceptability as the new WTO chief, and Mchumo
eventually agreed to consider it.
</P>
<P>
   There is still the option of a vote to decide between the two
candidates, although many countries oppose this as contrary to the
four-year-old organization's way of doing business by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   If the deadlock continues, diplomats increasingly were
entertaining the possibility of jettisoning both candidates and
starting over.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the meeting got under way, Renato Ruggiero, the
outgoing director-general, whose selection four years ago had been
marked by bitterness, officially left his post and drove off,
foreclosing the option that he might stay on to tide the trade
group over until it resolved its leadership crisis.

OKLAHOMANS ASSESS THE DAMAGE FROM MONSTER TWISTER, VOW TO REBUILD
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: CORRECTS lede to say ``behemoth'' twister ``ravaged''
namesake) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA, REBECA RODRIGUEZ and JENNIFER AUTRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Their cities pulverized, yet miraculously spared
greater human loss, Oklahomans raked through splintered ruins on
Tuesday, vowing to rise from the destruction of a behemoth twister
that ravaged its namesake Tornado Alley.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's swirling 260-mph winds killed at least 38 people in
Oklahoma City and outlying cities, injured hundreds, destroyed
2,000 buildings and left thousands without homes or electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The largest twister formed about 45 miles southwest of Oklahoma
City late Monday afternoon and cut a path at least a half-mile
wide, staying on the ground for up to four hours, according to some
estimates, as TV stations tracked and televised its vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one did not go up and down,'' Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating
said after surveying the damage. ``This was a half-mile-wide
tornado the length of an aircraft carrier that just sat down and
stayed on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on NBC's ``Today'' show, he said, ``We have
whole communities that simply aren't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation, Keating promised that Oklahomans ``will
rebuild this state. We'll be back stronger than we ever were.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor mobilized the National Guard to help in the rescues
and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The entire state was declared a disaster area and President
Clinton approved federal assistance, saying he also planned to
visit Oklahoma on Saturday for a tour of the devastated areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the damage in Oklahoma City, it looks like
the warning system did work well for the death toll to be so low,
when you see the amount of catastrophic damage there was,'' said
Dave Imy of the Storm Prediction Center in Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Hansen, an assistant fire chief in Oklahoma City, likened
the scene to that of the Oklahoma bombing on April 19, 1995: ``It
looks like the Murrah Building, but instead of nine stories tall,
it's spread out over a large area.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Charles Allen, Oklahoma City police spokesman, also
recalled the bombing and how the city responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like the national champions when it comes to dealing
with disasters,'' Allen said. ``We bury our dead. We take care of
our wounded. We rebuild. We move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Oklahoma communities fell victim to the twister's vicious
force. The most deadly was Bridge Creek, about 30 miles southwest
of Oklahoma City, where 11 people were killed. Other fatalities
were in Oklahoma City and nearby Midwest City, Moore, Del City and
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Spawned by the same storm system that raked Oklahoma, another
tornado cut a path 12 miles long and three miles wide in Kansas,
killing five people and injuring 100 in southern Wichita and
suburban Haysville.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the Oklahoma toll, the tornado outbreak was the
nation's deadliest since 42 people were killed in Florida last
year. It was also the deadliest such tragedy to hit Oklahoma since
April 9, 1947, when a twister killed 113 people in Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   While on its destructive tear in Oklahoma, the tornadoes crossed
four freeways and brushed Tinker Air Force Base, wiping out or
damaging half of the homes in Moore, a city of 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   One Oklahoma state trooper likened the destruction in a Moore
neighborhood to a war zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen pictures of the damage in Kosovo _ well just go
down there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Oklahoma City area, cars were tossed about and
crushed, natural gas lines were ruptured and utility poles were
shredded into kindling.
</P>
<P>
   Along Interstates 35 and 240, the storm littered the freeway
shoulders with debris and personal items from as far away as
Chickasha, where the tornadoes began their rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents, taking advantage of ample warning provided by a
radar system that allowed televisions to track its path street by
street, fled in advance of the mammoth funnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many lives were saved by the early warning,'' said
Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk Humphreys.
</P>
<P>
   The early warning alerted an off-duty police officer to lead to
shelter about 300 students meeting at West Moore High School, most
likely saving them from serious injury or death, said Capt. Charles
Allen, Oklahoma City police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most tornadoes that hop-scotch around, this one didn't.
It was so big it seemed to rumble, wiping out everything in its
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `There's no way something that big moves
on this earth,''' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't miss it,'' said Randy Lacy, a Moore resident who
watched it pass within a mile of his home. ``Every time you looked,
the storm looked like it was coming right at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred Carr, director of the University of Oklahoma School of
Meterology, called the tornado's one-mile width ``extreme'' and
``just a few percent will do that in a given year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most tornadoes, he said, measure only 500 to 600 feet wide, skip
across landscape and don't pack the wallop necessary to rate an F5
classification on the Fujita Scale _ the highest storm severity
designation, meaning winds in excess of 260 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, ambulances and U-hauls crawled through the
ruins of what once was a cozy, diverse subdivision in southeast
Oklahoma City called Frolich Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and daughters hugged and cried as they looked upon acres
of haunting, twisted trees and 8-foot-high mounds of oozing pink
fiberglass insulation, broken bricks and splintered wood, all that
was left of what had been $80,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners, such as Carol Warner, 62, and her husband,
survived the tornado by clinging to pillows on the floor of their
hall bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ears were popping and I could feel the gusts like they were
going to suck me into the air,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Warners lived to talk about their terror, others did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a back-hoe lifted a van off the collapsed
bathroom of a neighbor's house, where rescuers worked more than
four hours to retrieve the body of Jack Self, 86, a retired
minister known in the community simply as ``Brother Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the family of Aaron LeClaire, 47, a computer specialist
for the Federal Aviation Administration, stopped looking for their
three-wheeler to watch a neighbor search for his wife under a mound
of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   What had been a thick line of tall trees that separated their
properties was now two feet high, and the neighbor's grief played
out as he frantically cried, ``Linda! Linda! Linda!''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, rescue workers found his wife dead.
</P>
<P>
   Along the southern edge of Oklahoma City, drivers jammed
two-lane county roads in a futile attempt to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't going nowhere,'' said Carl Haynes. ``I don't know
what's left of my home, but this can't be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating urged Oklahoma residents to follow the neighborly
example set during the Oklahoma City bombing four years ago,
warning businesses not to gouge customers and take advantage of
their plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your neighbor is homeless, take him in,'' Keating said.
``If your neighbor is without clothing or food, make sure they get
what they need.''

AMWEST GROUP TO QUIT WRITING CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS POLICIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ Amwest Insurance Group reported a 15 percent
increase in earnings for the first quarter and announced that it
was pulling out of the California homeowners insurance and Arizona
automobile markets.
</P>
<P>
   The holding company for Amwest Surety Insurance, Condor
Insurance and Far West Insurance credited an improvement in risk
factors for better business. But the company has decided not to
write homeowners policies in California and private passenger
insurance in Arizona because they weren't paying off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results just weren't that good,'' said Steven Kay, chief
financial officer of Amwest, based in Calabasas, northwest of Los
Angeles. ``These two were ancillary markets we got sidetracked
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Amwest wasn't writing a lot of homeowners insurance in
California in the first place, which left the company vulnerable to
a handful of big claims, Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Arizona, ``It's tough to make money there,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Amwest is concentrating on commercial trucking
insurance. The company began improving its ``loss ratio'' in
property and casualty insurance _ it managed its risks better by
targeting agents who will charge appropriate rates.
</P>
<P>
   Amwest also employs a staff that checks whether the trucks of
its clients are well-maintained, in an effort to control insurance
losses.
</P>
<P>
   A better loss ratio in property and casualty insurance led to
improved earnings at Amwest.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a net income of $2.37 million (or 55 cents
a diluted share) for the first quarter ended March 31 compared with
a net income of $2.06 million (48 cents) in the like period a year
ago. Gross premiums written rose 9.5 percent to $32.13 million from
$29.34 million in the previous year.

MERCURY GAINS HELP ALL AROUND IN DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A bigger, tougher and better-shooting Mercury, likely
with two new starters, emerged Tuesday from the third WNBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting guard Edna Campbell (10th pick overall) and small
forward Clarissa Davis-Wrightsil (22nd) potentially are capable of
beating out two-year starters Bridget Pettis and Umeki Webb, Coach
and General Manager Cheryl Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5-foot-9 Pettis, for all her inconsistencies, will not
surrender easily to the 5-8 Campbell, creating a major competition
in training camp, which opens May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping her job will be much harder for Webb, 5-10, who is three
inches shorter than Davis-Wrightsil and not nearly the scorer or
physical presence of the 1992 Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   Webb and backup guard/forward Andrea Kuklova are likely to
battle with the other two draft picks, forwards Lisa Harrison (34th
pick overall) and Amanda Wilson (46th), for the final two spots on
an 11-woman roster.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, one of four players from the Colorado Xplosion of the
defunct American Basketball League taken among the first 15 picks,
was a 40.8 percent career three-point shooter in the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   Pettis shot 30.6 from three-point range in 1997 and 28.5 in '98.
Her scoring averages (12.6 and 11.3) are lower than Campbell's
(14.2 in 1996-97, 13.9 in 1997-98, 17.3 in 1998-99).
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Campbell, 30, ``can pull up for a three, she can
create her own scoring opportunities, she can break off the
dribble, pull up at mid-range and finish, she can get to the rack
and get to the free-throw line. And defensively, she can get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury, Campbell said, ``seems like a very enthusiastic
team. Obviously they've been successful in the past, and hopefully
that will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole new situation. I'm very excited for someone
who has gone through a league folding.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis-Wrightsil, 31, was a sophomore at Texas in 1985-86 when
the Longhorns became the first undefeated NCAA champion. Their
conquest in the title game: two-time national champion Southern
California and Miller in her final collegiate game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game of our season, she'll be benched for messing up
my national championship game,'' Miller joked.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Davis-Wrightsil probably will be starting from game
one, June 12 against Sacramento, as the league runner-up Mercury
strives to get bigger on the perimeter and meaner to a degree _
just shy of the level reached on Dec. 15, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Davis-Wrightsil, then playing for the ABL's New
England Blizzard first leveled Seattle's Cindy Brown with a punch
that drew a $1,500 fine and two-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is going into her second season with the WNBA Detroit
Shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two knocks I heard about Clarissa were her attitude and
her age,'' Miller said. ``Age isn't the same as with the men, it
really isn't. That doesn't mean anything to me. I want players who
are competitive and have some experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attitude is somebody cracking the heck out of somebody. Do I
want a player like that? No question. People mistake attitude with
somebody being a competitor. I've had nothing but good dealings
with Clarissa.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis-Wrightsil, who enjoyed watching Mercury games on TV, said
Miller ``knows what I bring to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot Harrison joins from two-time defending ABL champion
Columbus. She played less than half a season for the Quest after
being traded from the Portland Power.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, on Tennessee's 1991 national championship team, and
the 6-foot Wilson, a pro rookie out of Louisiana Tech, have Kodak
All-America credentials and offer versatility and youth to a team
with four players 30 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Vice President Seth Sulka said that in a draft without
ABL players, Wilson, who must transition to the perimeter, would
have been a top-10 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Of Harrison, Miller said: ``You won't see her do anything
spectacular, but at the end of the game she has 10 points, four to
five rebounds, three assists and a couple of steals. She knows the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and Wilson will get especially good looks in camp
because centers Maria Stepanova and Marlies Askamp are not
reporting until after the European Championships, which run May
28-June 6.
</P>
<P>
   That probably will force the 6-3 Gillom, who has slimmed down,
to continue at center, with 6-1 Toni Foster at power forward and
the newcomers working at both forward positions. &QL;

KICKERS PREPARING FOR BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Kicker  &UR; Joe Nedney wants to burn memories of this
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to light a match to miniature footballs he has been
kicking while recovering from a torn anterior cruciate of his left
(kicking) knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a sacrificial ceremony,'' Nedney said.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney is kicking regulation footballs at this week's voluntary
camp but is not kicking off at full speed or attempting field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chris Jacke, his competition for the kicking job, is handling
the field-goal chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do field goals right now,'' Nedney said. ``But it's
too early to push anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Both kickers know the job won't be won in May. It will be won in
August at training camp and in four preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a legitimate battle,'' special teams coach  &UR; Al Everett
said. ``It's going to be exciting. The bottom line is they know
they're not kicking against each other. They're kicking for a job,
and they know if they do well enough, one will get (the Cardinals')
job and the other will land a job elsewhere in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett said he thought Nedney was about 75 to 80 percent
recovered from the injury. ``There's no soreness or swelling,'' he
said. ``He's kicking with pretty good pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke, who replaced an injured Nedney the final four games of
the regular season, said he thinks each kicker will get a fair
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``All indications are that they are going to take the best
guy,'' Jacke said. ``The teams who make things political are
fighting for the first draft pick (overall). This is fighting to
get in a position to go to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We each had three games in which we won with (field goals). So
from that standpoint, I think we're dead even.'' &QL; 
Miller watch &QL; 
Another team has entered the picture in the free-agent
linebacker &UR; Jamir Miller sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Browns are interested in Miller, an unrestricted
free agent whose only contract offer has come from his old team,
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans, Tennessee, New England and Chicago also showed
interest earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials have said they haven't closed the door to
inviting Miller back. &QL; 
Quick learners &QL; 
Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin thinks the switch of  &UR; Pat Tillman to strong
safety and  &UR; J.J. McCleskey to free safety has been an easy
transition for each.
</P>
<P>
   ``With J.J.'s quickness and speed, he can have more range at
free safety,' ' Tobin said. ``Pat has more size and bulk that helps
him in the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillman played free safety and McCleskey was used at cornerback
and strong safety last season.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin switched the two at the start of last weekend's minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman said he likes strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little more active there and there is a lot more run
support,'' he said. &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Defensive end  &UR; Simeon Rice will miss this week's camp because of
personal business in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver  &UR; Kevin Drake scored his first touchdown in the
Europe League, a 12-yard grab in Scotland's overtime loss to
Frankfurt last weekend. &QL;

SUNS WAIVE SIMS, SIGN LIVINGSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - While point guard  &UR; Jason Kidd has compiled more
playing time than any other player in the NBA, the Suns have had a
seasonlong problem finding somebody to take care of those remaining
six minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Suns signed yet another backup point
guard, &UR; Randy
 &UR; Livingston, and waived their previous experiment,  &UR; Alvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, a 6-foot-5, 209-pound guard from Louisiana State, is
the fourth player the Suns will use as a backup to Kidd this
season, joining undrafted free agent  &UR; Gerald Brown, who is on the
injured list,
 &UR; Jimmy Oliver and Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver was signed to a 10-day contract and released before he
completed it. Sims was signed for the balance of the season April
28 but was waived after appearing in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston at least has NBA experience. He played in 64 games
and two playoff contests as a rookie with the Houston Rockets in
1996-97 and spent 12 games with the Atlanta Hawks last season.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was a highly regarded prospect in high school but
suffered two serious knee injuries while at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was intrigued by him when he came out of college,'' Suns
Coach
 &UR; Danny Ainge said. ``I saw him at (an evaluation) camp, and he was
the best player out there while dragging one leg around. I hadn't
heard anything about him in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember wondering who this guy was who was playing great
and doing it on one leg. He had some knee injuries, but the Rockets
loved him. He isn't a spot-up shooter like they wanted with &UR; Hakeem
 &UR; (Olajuwon) and  &UR; Charles (Barkley), but he knows how to play. And
he's a born one (point guard).''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston played this season for CBA champion Sioux Falls,
averaging 13.7 points, 6.5 assists and 4.2 rebounds a game. He
averaged 19.2 points, 7.8 assists and 4.2 rebounds in the CBA
playoffs. &QL; 
Working for tips &QL; 
Centers  &UR; Joe Kleine and &UR; Luc Longley, along with assistant
coaches &UR; Frank Johnson and  &UR; Tom Chambers and former Suns star
 &UR; Connie Hawkins will join the Mercury's &UR; Umeki Webb as celebrity
waiters Thursday night at Majerle's Sports Grill. The group will
work the tables from 5 to 7 p.m. to raise money for Suns Nite
Hoops, a program that assists young adults with vocational and
educational development through a basketball league. &QL;

PLAYING TIME BIG QUESTION IN SUNS' FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Danny Ainge would never say it, but he's damned if he
does and he's damned if he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   OK, for Ainge, he's danged if he does and danged if he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Suns finish the lockout-abbreviated, 50-game
regular season tonight against the Minnesota Timberwolves at
America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   If Ainge plays his regulars and goes all out to win the game, he
risks having a player hurt.
</P>
<P>
   For which Ainge will be second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
   If he rests players such as Jason Kidd, Tom Gugliotta, Clifford
Robinson and George McCloud, the Suns risk taking a two-game losing
streak into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For which Ainge will be second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, it's a no-win situation,'' Ainge agreed.
``The fans want to see a player like Jason play, and we want to win
the game. At the same time, what if we lose of one of our key
players because of an injury? For what? For seventh instead of
eighth (seed) in the playoffs?''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the Suns are playing for nothing tonight other than
perhaps pride and momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns could play any of three teams in the first round _
Utah, Portland or San Antonio. And it might not matter whether they
win or lose tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Portland swept the Suns this season, but Phoenix had a chance to
win two games down the stretch. The Suns won two from San Antonio
and lost another on a buzzer-beating shot by Sean Elliott. They
split with the Jazz, winning the last two, including one in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter who we play,'' Robinson said. ``We're
capable of beating any of the three in a series _ if we're playing
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Suns swear they don't have any preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if we're six, seven or eight,'' Ainge said.
``It's no bargain playing one, two or three. I think the most
important thing is to be healthy. The second-most important thing
is to be confident.''
</P>
<P>
   So doesn't a victory provide that confidence and momentum?
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum changes,'' Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   There's evidence of that. Last season, the Suns won 11 of their
last 12, including their season finale at Houston. They lost their
first-round playoff series to San Antonio in four games.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996-97, the Suns won 13 of their last 16 but lost two of
their last three, including the season finale to a bad Vancouver
club. The Suns bounced back to win Game 1 of their first-round
series against Seattle and led the series, 2-1, before falling in
five games.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1995-96, the Suns lost guard Michael Finley to a sprained
ankle in a season-ending loss to Houston and were beaten, 3-1, in
the first round by San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd almost rather we go into the playoffs angry,'' Ainge said.
``We respond better after a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ainge hasn't been able to convince his players, particularly
Kidd. The Phoenix playmaker suffered a sprained wrist in a game at
Utah, and the team attempted to keep news of the injury quiet.
Ainge figures that even hand-checking an opponent could make the
wrist a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Jason if he wanted to take the night off up in
Sacramento,'' Ainge said. ``He wasn't having any part of it. He
said, `No. I'm playing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want a night off. I'm not afraid of injuries if a
player is already healthy. But if somebody is hurt, you don't want
them to aggravate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd agreed that having everybody healthy is important. But he
isn't ready to concede a game, even it it means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to win the last game,'' he said. ``The biggest
thing is to make sure everybody is healthy. We don't want any freak
accidents. I don't know how much it's going to mean because we're
going to come up against a good team in the playoffs if we face
Utah, San Antonio or Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, I think our team is playing extremely
well right now. I think we trust each other. And we want to carry
that into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go in on a high note, not a low note,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to play well and not worry about who we play. We
really have no preference. When you get caught up in who you'd
rather play, sometimes that comes back to bite you.'' &QL;

QUESTIONS ABOUND AFTER WNBA DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston selecting a post player instead of a point guard in the
first round?
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Goodson dropping to the third round?
</P>
<P>
   Carol Blazejowksi and Richie Adubato: Geniuses or bunglers?
</P>
<P>
   Those were among the questions being asked after the WNBA draft
Tuesday, a week later than originally scheduled due to glitches in
putting the league's first collective bargaining agreement on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   The extra week did nothing to deter two of the teams picking
among the top three from substantially improving. Whether the
three-win Washington Mystics, with the only collegian of the first
round in No. 1 overall pick Chamique Holdsclaw, did as well remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA President Val Ackerman called the draft, which included
every former American Basketball League star except 34-year-old
Teresa Edwards, who opted not to sign, the ``deepest in modern-day
sports. I'm just not aware of any other draft that has had this
level of talent available.''
</P>
<P>
   In draft order, here's a look at what the Mercury's rivals did: &QL; 
Washington
</P>
<P>
   Even the all-everything Holdsclaw will need pro seasoning,
although she should evolve enough to be Rookie of the Year.
Third-rounder Andrea Nagy gets the point duty, working with former
ABL MVP Nikki McCray and Holdsclaw on the perimeter, while quality
second-rounder Shalonda Enis stays inside instead of going to the
perimeter as she would have with the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   But Enis, Murriel Page and Alessandra Santos de Oliveira are not
enough inside. The Mystics might want to trade with Utah for Wendy
Palmer. &QL; 
Sacramento
</P>
<P>
   An argument can be made that Natalie Williams would have been
the better choice with the No. 2 overall pick than Yolanda
Griffith, but why quibble. Either is a monster improvement in the
post.
</P>
<P>
   A perimeter of point Ticha Penicheiro, a healthy Ruthie
Bolton-Holifield, second-rounder Kedra Holland-Corn and third-round
wing Kate Starbird will be a challenge to defend, though Starbird
can be a defensive liability. Fourth-rounder Amy Herrig joins
another 6-foot-4 post, Tangela Smith, Griffith and Latasha Byears
underneath. &QL; 
Utah
</P>
<P>
   In landing hometown favorite Williams, who estimates she has 200
relatives in the area, the Starzz make a healthy leap in talent and
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Frank Layden already is talking about a lineup of
second-rounder Debbie Black at point, 6-5 Elena Baranova at
shooting guard, 7-2 Margo Dydek at small forward, 6-2 Palmer at
power forward and 6-2 Williams at center.
</P>
<P>
   But why play Dydek away from the basket when the third-rounder,
6-foot Goodson, averaged 17.5 points and 7.9 rebounds in her ABL
career? They could trade Palmer for depth at guard, use Olympia
Scott-Richardson low with Dydek and Williams, Baranova on the wing
and Goodson at shooting guard. &QL; 
Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Going big for 6-1 DeLisha Milton, rather than point guard Dawn
Staley, in the first round and 6-5 Clarisse Machanguana in the
second is a gamble dependent on point Penny Toler's attitude and
rookie third-rounder Ukari Figgs being a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   Machanguana conceivably could play either post position with
Milton and 6-5 Lisa Leslie. The perimeter includes Allison Feaster,
who missed most of 1998 due to injury, Tamecka Dixon, Toler, Figgs
and athletic Mwadi Mabika.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcement for Leslie has to help a team embarassed by two
years outside the playoffs. &QL; 
Detroit
</P>
<P>
   The Shock are a perimeter heavy team with the additions of
first-rounder Jennifer Azzi and Dominique Canty, the collegiate
All-America from Alabama who slipped to the third round by not
appearing at the pre-draft camp. They join Kori Hlede and
Australians Sandy Brondello and Carla Porter in a mix that will
take some figuring out.
</P>
<P>
   Second-rounder Val Whiting and fourth-round comer Astou Ndiaye
join Cindy Brown and inconsistent 6-8 Raja Mujanovic inside. &QL; 
New York
</P>
<P>
   Although Alicia Thompson (1.6 ppg, 1.3 rpg) was a 1998
first-round bust, the Liberty went collegiate in the second and
third rounds with posts Michele VanGorp of Duke and Tamika Whitmore
of Memphis. Then they took a future pick in the fourth with Carolyn
Jones-Young, who averaged 21.5 points for the ABL New England
Blizzard but is out this season due to injury.
</P>
<P>
   First-rounder Crystal Robinson probably will push Vickie Johnson
to the bench at small forward, but the front line of aging Kym
Hampton and Rebecca Lobo has to have help. The learning curve needs
to be quick for VanGorp and/or Whitmore for General Manager
Blazejowski and her new coach Adubato to warrant the luxury of
taking Jones-Young. &QL; 
Minnesota
</P>
<P>
   Former Quest Coach Brian Agler exceeds his expectations with
four of his former Quest players. But just because Sonja Tate and
Angie Potthoff were available late, does that justify overlooking
collegians Angie Braziel and Amanda Wilson or Elaine Powell, snared
by Orlando with its extra expansion pick?
</P>
<P>
   The Lynx has no one taller than second-rounder Trish Fallon, a
6-3 forward from Australia. Agler's system that worked so well in
the ABL will be put to a major test. &QL; 
Orlando
</P>
<P>
   Hometowner Tari Phillips went too high at No. 8 overall, but Taj
McWilliams was a get at No.T32 and Powell was a steal at No. 50.
Second-rounder Sheri Sam is friends with Nykesha Sales, an
allocated player, and the Miracle's other allocation, Shannon
Johnson, has some national-team time with Sales.
</P>
<P>
   Give Coach-General Manager Carolyn Peck credit for going with
ABL experience and not reaching for her former Purdue guards,
Stephanie White-McCarty and Figgs. &QL; 
Charlotte
</P>
<P>
   Marynell Meadors wasn't as disciplined as Peck, unaccountably
taking White-McCarty in the second round after coming up with
Staley in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Third-rounder Charlotte Smith raises the in-state college
connection to five, even though the Sting averaged just 8,561 with
the previous four. &QL; 
Cleveland
</P>
<P>
   Chasity Melvin went to Spain after the ABL folded and hopefully
learned enough to justify being the 11th pick overall. If Janice
Braxton retires and Isabelle Fijalkowski isn't paid enough to
warrant returning from France, the weight falls unfairly on the
second-year pro. The Rockers will be hard-pressed to defend their
Eastern Conference crown. &QL; 
Houston
</P>
<P>
   The Comets could cruise to a third league title with the
additions of 6-3 Zassoulskaia and 6-7 Kara Wolters to a team that
also gets 6-4 Polina Tzekova, its 1998 No. 1 pick who missed last
season due to her mother's illness.
</P>
<P>
   If second-rounder Sonja Henning, fourth-rounder Jennifer
Rizzotti and Janeth Arcain can replace cancer-stricken Kim Perrot
at point by committee, the race might be for second place. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S NOT SEVENTH HEAVEN
</HEADLINE>
   (With HKN-DEVILS-PENGUINS) 
(nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the decisive seventh game of a
Stanley Cup playoff series, it always boils down to the
goaltenders. It always has. It always will.
</P>
<P>
   If the ace of a baseball team's pitching staff could start every
game in the league playoffs or the World Series, it would be
comparable to a hockey goaltender's burden. But that doesn't happen
in baseball. And there's no one player on a basketball or a
football team who is perpetually on trial as much as a hockey
goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   All the other players on a hockey team skate to the bench for a
breather every so often as the forward lines and defensemen change,
but a goaltender is a sentry who is never off duty.
</P>
<P>
   In a showdown that would be seventh heaven for one goaltender
and hell for the other, Martin Brodeur of the Devils confronted Tom
Barrasso of the Penguins Tuesday night in the finale of the
opening-round playoff series at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hell for Brodeur, who gave up four goals in
Pittsburgh's 4-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Neither goaltender had to worry about the specter of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   After last Sunday's sixth game went into overtime in Pittsburgh,
Barrasso skated off the ice as a winner after Jaromir Jagr drilled
the winning goal past Brodeur at 8 minutes 59 seconds for a 3-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, in contrast, could be excused for starting to be
spooked by the thought of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's loss was the sixth straight time that Brodeur and the
Devils had been victimized by an overtime goal in the playoffs; his
career record is 3-10, not what is expected from a goaltender of
his All-Star stature.
</P>
<P>
   Of the active goaltenders, Colorado's Patrick Roy has the best
playoff overtime record, 32-9.
</P>
<P>
   Over his six Devils seasons, Brodeur's career 2.19 goals-against
average is the best in the National Hockey League's modern era. Ken
Dryden had a 2.24 average for Montreal during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   When the Devils won the Stanley Cup in 1995, Brodeur was
brilliant: a 1.67 goals-against average with a 16-4 record and
three shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Until the current playoffs, he had a 1.84 goals-against average
in the playoffs and a 31-23 record.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent season, Brodeur led the league with 39
victories, but his goals-against average was 2.29 with four
shutouts, up from 1.88 with 10 shutouts a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first six games of this playoff series with the
Penguins, Brodeur's goals-against average was a shaky 2.62 and his
save percentage was an even shakier .873.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's loss, Brodeur's teammates talked about how he had
thwarted the Penguins in the final minutes of regulation (until
Jagr's goal with less than 3 minutes remaining) and again during
the early minutes of overtime until Jagr's winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   But were his teammates simply trying to bolster Brodeur's
confidence for Tuesday night's showdown? Especially those who knew
of his 0-6 streak in overtime games?
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur's previous seventh game, an overtime loss to the Rangers
at Madison Square Garden in the 1994 Eastern Conference finals, had
been especially haunting.
</P>
<P>
   After the Devils had created a 1-1 tie on Valery Zelepukin's
goal with only 7.7 seconds remaining in regulation, Brodeur and
Rangers goaltender Mike Richter dueled into the second overtime
before the Rangers won, 2-1, on Stephane Matteau's goal after 4:24.
</P>
<P>
   In that year's opening-round series, Brodeur lost a 1-0 sixth
game in Buffalo in the fourth overtime period as Sabres goaltender
Dominik Hasek made 70 saves, but two nights later, in Brodeur's
only other previous seventh game, he stopped the Sabres, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   When the Devils won the Stanley Cup in 1995, Brodeur was the
goaltender in two of the Devils' overtime victories, against Boston
and Pittsburgh, but his 0-6 streak started with Eric Lindros'
overtime goal for Philadelphia in the third game of the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 playoffs, Brodeur lost in overtime twice _ to
Montreal and to the Rangers (on Adams Graves' goal that ended the
Eastern Conference semifinals).
</P>
<P>
   In last year's playoffs, Brodeur lost in overtime twice as the
eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators stunned the top-seeded Devils in six
games in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night, for the first time since 1994, Martin Brodeur
found himself in a seventh-game showdown that has always boiled
down to the goaltenders. And he lost.

APRIL AUTO SALES IMPRESSIVE DESPITE LOWER GM RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Car and truck buyers were out in force in April, and
as a result the auto industry turned in strong sales results just
as it heads into the crucial summer selling season. Sales rose 3.9
percent over all in April, and the industry sold cars, sport
utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans at a brisk seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 16.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The impressive results came despite lower-than-expected sales at
General Motors Corp. GM said its sales fell 4 percent in April,
with car sales falling 4.5 percent and truck sales falling 3.5
percent compared with results in the month a year earlier. Wall
Street analysts cautioned that the GM results were not as weak as
they seemed because GM had blockbuster results last April when it
was offering particularly hefty rebates. Still, analysts expected
GM's sales to decline no more than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But GM executives were upbeat. ``April was a very good month for
us,'' said Roy Roberts, vice president and group executive for
North America Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing. ``Our market
share is north of 30 percent for the first time in seven months.''
GM's market share in April was 30.6 percent, down from 33.2 in
April of last year. Much of the decline came from GM's largest
division, Chevrolet, where sales dropped 10.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   The sales came at a price. GM offered hefty rebates and other
incentives on many of its vehicles in April. For instance, current
Cadillac owners are entitled to $1,000 off the price of any new
Cadillac except the Escalade sport utility vehicle. Pontiac will
lease its Grand Am sedan for $219 a month. And Buick is offering
three-year, zero interest leases on four of its models, as if it
were borrowing the money at Japanese interest rates and passing on
the savings to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with nearly a year of especially strong sales
results, automakers are considering building factories in the
United States to help meet demand. GM's board tentatively approved
plans to build a new factory in Lansing, Mich., to produce
rear-wheel drive luxury vehicles. GM is still negotiating
agreements with the United Auto Workers union and state and local
governments but could begin construction for the factory as early
as this summer, said Kyle Johnson, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, which said on Monday that its sales rose 4 percent last
month and 8.3 percent so far this year, is considering building its
third American factory and is looking at sites in Alabama and
Georgia. Alabama is considered the front-runner for the factory,
which would build sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said the industry's strong sales reflected
a buyer's market. ``There are a lot of really interesting products
out there for people to buy, and people are getting good prices,''
said Wendy Beale Needham, an auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Economists concur that the strong sales are fed by several
factors: strong economic growth, a surging stock market, low
interest rates, tax refunds and hefty rebates and other sales
incentives. Auto executives agree but add that some of the strength
in sales can be predicted by reading demographic tea leaves.
</P>
<P>
   David Bostwick, director of corporate market research for
DaimlerChrysler AG, said automakers were selling more cars and
trucks because the leading edge of the baby boom had reached prime
car-buying age. ``This is basically the time when you buy more cars
more often than any time of your life,'' Bostwick said.
</P>
<P>
   Other automakers also reported strong sales. On Monday, Ford
Motor Co. said its sales rose 6.6 percent, DaimlerChrysler sales
rose 3 percent, Toyota sales rose 9.6 percent and Nissan rose 21.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda sales rose 16.7 percent in April, to 21,989. Kia sales
nearly doubled, to 10,606, and Hyundai sales nearly doubled, to
10,685.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo, the Korean company that began selling cars in the United
States last September, sold 2,006 cars in April. Volkswagen AG said
its April sales rose 29.5 percent. Audi said its sales rose 29.3
percent, to 5,592, because of strong sales of the Audi A4 and A6
models. Subaru sales rose 12 percent, to 12,331, because stronger
sales of the Forester offset weaker sales of the Impreza. Isuzu
said its sales fell 5.8 percent, to 7,011.
</P>
<P>
   BMW sales rose 14.1 percent, to 14,225. Mitsubishi sales rose
21.3 percent, to 16,370, and Porsche sales rose 11 percent, to
2,198.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: DRIVERS FACE A SUMMER OF RISING GASOLINE PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the summer driving season approaching, the price of
gasoline across the country has jumped sharply from historically
low levels as major oil producing countries cut supplies of crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
   The supply of crude remains the most crucial factor affecting
gasoline, but many experts warn that a shortage of another kind may
push prices at the pump higher in the months ahead: tight supplies
of refined gasoline in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for gasoline has been increasing steadily, spurred by the
economic boom of the 1990s, by the growing popularity of big sport
utility vehicles that have relatively poor gas efficiency _ and by
the low price of fuel. In February, at 87.8 cents a gallon for
regular nationwide, gas was as low, on an inflation-adjusted basis,
as it had been since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Even with price rises since then _ almost 29 percent, to an
average of $1.13 a gallon nationwide _ energy prices remain
relatively modest in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting oil and gas prices is an inexact science at best.
During the summer, the Energy Department says, the likelihood is
that gasoline will range from $1.08 to $1.18 a gallon, 9 to 10
cents higher than the unusually low prices seen last summer. Since
the average motorist drives 15,000 miles a year and gets 21 miles a
gallon, and would spend $821 a year on gas at $1.15 a gallon,
according to AAA, such prices would not pose a huge financial
burden.
</P>
<P>
   But two factors may drive prices higher. The first, the supply
of crude oil, has received most attention. Two announced cutbacks
in production by a coalition comprised of members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC members
like Norway, Mexico, Russia and Oman have driven prices up from a
low of $10.35 a barrel in December to $18.92 a barrel Tuesday on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil prices have risen in
anticipation of actual production cuts. If the cutbacks don't
stick, the price of oil, and of gasoline at the pump, could decline
again.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the declining capacity of refineries to process crude
oil and convert it into gas and other products that has recently
come under scrutiny on the West Coast, and is likely to become more
of an issue across the country, many analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   From 18 million barrels of crude oil a day in 1981, refining
capacity across the country declined sharply during the next 15
years as the industry underwent a period of low profit margins,
consolidation and investment in equipment to meet more stringent
environmental regulations. Capacity began to rise modestly four
years ago. Still, it now stands at only 16 million barrels a day
and demand is growing faster than supply.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, refineries have been running at top
production levels. ``Refiners have to work full blast just to keep
up with demand,'' said Fred Leuffer, an analyst for Bear, Stearns.
``There is no more room for error.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortfalls are being made up by imports of gasoline, which are
more expensive and have been less reliable than domestically
refined fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, when production at refineries is
disrupted, as occurred recently in California, spikes in gasoline
prices are likely to follow. In a case now under investigation by
the California State Attorney General's office, prices jumped by
more than 40 percent after two fires shut refineries there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over the next several years, new regulations by the
Environmental Protection Agency to greatly lessen the amount of
sulfur in gasoline would require considerable investment by
refineries just to make existing quantities of gasoline
environmentally acceptable. Under new rules proposed by President
Clinton on Saturday the agency would require the industry to
produce gasoline with no more than 30 parts per million of sulfur,
about a 91 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   All these factors are likely to put pressure on prices at the
pump nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will still get what they want to buy,'' said Larry
Goldstein, with the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a
research group for the industry in Manhattan. ``There will just be
times when they will have to pay more for gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting a return to the gas lines of 1973 and 1979,
which were the result of big cuts in the supply of oil by OPEC.
Barring unforeseen disasters, oil supplies are generally believed
to be too abundant and diversified to allow critical shortages that
might require rationing or long lines at gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth raising the concern,'' said Jeff A. Dietert, an
analyst who covers refining for Simmons &AMP; Company International of
Houston ``But I don't think that the world is about to come to an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely are occasional price spikes, most analysts say. In
California, the refinery fires cut production by about 15 percent.
Prices for regular unleaded gasoline in the state jumped from an
average of $1.11 a gallon in February to nearly $1.60 in March
before starting to recede in recent weeks to the current level of
$1.47 a gallon. Shipments from the Gulf Coast and from as far as
Korea eventually helped to ease the state's shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, some California municipalities and consumer groups
urged drivers not to buy gasoline in protest.
</P>
<P>
   John Gioia, a member of the Contra Costa County Board of
Supervisors, which supported the boycott, said that while the
effort had little economic impact it was a ``symbolic statement of
concern over the action of the oil companies.''
</P>
<P>
   California's geography and its stringent environmental
regulations have made the state's gas more expensive than in the
rest of the nation. Even if gasoline could be shipped from the East
Coast to the West economically, it would not meet California's
regulatory standards.
</P>
<P>
   But across the country, demand for gasoline grew at a pace of
about 3 percent last year, with another 2 percent expected this
year. Refineries nationwide are expected to be hard pressed to meet
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to run harder and harder because demand
is outstripping supply growth, '' said Leuffer, the Bear, Stearns
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Leuffer said, refiners and retailers will be
able to impose higher prices for gasoline, though he declined to
provide specific estimates.
</P>
<P>
   While the current tightness in refining capacity may impose
burdens on motorists, it represents a welcome change for the
industry. Overcapacity led to years of shrinking profits, and
inefficient refineries were abandoned. From 300 refineries in the
early 1980s, there are only about 160 refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's collapse of the price of crude oil, which cut
profits of oil companies and independent refiners alike, led to
belt tightening and low capital spending. For most companies, the
profit decline continued into the first quarter of this year and
capital spending remained low. Most companies say they are waiting
to see if the crude oil price remains at current levels.
</P>
<P>
   Refining capacity is due to grow at a little more than 1 percent
this year and probably not much more in the next few years,
industry analysts say. This compares with an increase of 2.6
percent last year and an average of 2.2 percent in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With capacity going up 1.8 percent and demand growing at more
than 2 percent you are going to get higher prices over time,'' said
Michael Mayer, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a check on the industry. Often when prices in
the United States climb, refiners in Europe and Latin America, who
still have extra capacity, begin to ship extra supplies. In the
first quarter of this year, for example, imports of gasoline were
up sharply, rising 7 percent over last year and accounting for 5.3
percent of total supply. For all of last year, imports amounted to
just 3.6 percent of supply.
</P>
<P>
   But the gasoline shipped here is more expensive. Transportation
costs add about 3 to 4 cents a gallon. Overseas refiners tend to
hold off, waiting to see whether United States shortages, and price
increases here, stick. That uncertainty often causes spot prices
for gasoline in the United States to run up even more in futures
markets. If sustained, those increases eventually get passed on to
the motorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement across the Atlantic is fairly expensive to
justify shipping a lot of gasoline,'' said Eric Leon, the
London-based general manager for the chemical and petroleum
industry for IBM, and a close observer of trends in refining in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, the price of gasoline in the United States
jumped about 10 cents a gallon when strong demand combined with
problems at several American refineries. The price surge, which was
ultimately alleviated by European imports, came even though crude
oil prices were dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Such short surges in prices, however, are not expected to cause
oil companies and independent refiners to ease their purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brief peaks in prices will not get a lot of investment going''
said John Cook, the director of the petroleum division of the
Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is to meet new environmental standards while
maintaining adequate gasoline supplies, he said. He expects that
imports of gasoline are likely to play a larger role in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern about making the transition,'' Cook added.
``How do you get from here to there without disrupting the
marketplace?'' &QL;

INJURED ROENICK RETURNS TO COYOTES LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick, expected to be
sidelined for team's entire playoff season because of a shattered
jaw and fractured right thumb, was given medical clearance to play
in Game 7 Tuesday night of the Coyotes' first-round series against
the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' leading scorer had hinted for the past several days
he would try to return to the lineup, but it was considered a
longshot and thought it wouldn't be until late in the second round,
at that, if Phoenix were to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to talk to a bunch of people to see if
they'll let me play,'' Roenick said Tuesday morning by telephone.
``My day's going to be full of negotiations, that's for sure. It's
a delicate issue, I know, but hey, we've got to win.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bobby Smith announced about an hour before game
time that the team's medical staff had given Roenick clearance to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, 29, had his jaw shattered in three places on April 14
in Dallas on a hit from Stars captain Derian Hatcher, who was
suspended seven games for the incident. Roenick's thumb also was
broken on the same play due to a slash from Craig Ludwig.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher missed the Stars' final two regular-season games and all
four games of Dallas' first-round series sweep of the Mighty Ducks
of Anaheim. He also must sit out the Stars' first game of Round 2
against the winner of the Coyotes-Blues series.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick had a specially-designed, protective faceguard attached
to his helmet, which apparently met approval from the NHL. The
10-year veteran, who led the Coyotes with 72 points (24 goals, 48
assists) in 78 games, had two steel plates inserted to realign his
jaw in a 5{-hour operation the day after the injury.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the Coyotes announced he was done for the season,
regardless of how far the club advanced in the playoffs.

<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ The heart of Oklahoma lay in tatters Tuesday
after as many as 36 tornadoes roared from the inky maw of a
torrential thunderstorm, killing at least 38 people and injuring
more than 669.
</P>
<P>
   Six others died and another 60 were injured in neighboring
Kansas when the same storm tore through the Wichita area.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the storm, which hit the Oklahoma City area
late Monday afternoon, was the deadliest since since the 1947
tornado in Woodward, which killed 116. One person was killed in
North Texas on Tuesday as the storm cell continued to drift
eastward.
</P>
<P>
   The devastation near Oklahoma City and Haysville, Kan., was so
complete Tuesday that residents conjured images of bomb-wasted
Belgrade and the rubble of Oklahoma City's blasted Alfred P. Murrah
federal building to describe what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe as many as 1,700 structures in Oklahoma were
heavily damaged or destroyed and that more than 6,000 people had
been left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Frank Keating placed damage in his state in the hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   James Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Administration, said, ``This is some of the worst, most massive
destruction I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who Tuesday declared 11 counties eligible for
federal disaster assistance, noted Oklahoma City residents have
``suffered too much devastation in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   He alluded to the 1995 bombing of the Murrah building, the worst
terrorist attack in U.S. history, in which 168 people died.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our fellow Americans have had everything taken from
them in those two states,'' he said. ``I know that they will be in
your prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he plans to visit the stricken area Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As Oklahoma struggled to cope with Monday's storm damage,
meteorologists warned Tuesday that the storms, still packing lethal
power, would move into eastern Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri
and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, The Associated Press reported, a tornado
tore through the downtown district of the Northeast Texas town of
DeKalb, damaging buildings and injuring at least 11 people, three
of them critically.
</P>
<P>
   A second tornado touched down Tuesday afternoon in rural Titus
County near Mount Pleasant, killing one person. No details were
available Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado also was sited Tuesday near the Cass County community
of Atlanta. It did not touch ground, a sheriff's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma City, a 12-square-mile area was cordoned off as
rescuers equipped with cameras and search dogs probed the
mountainous rubble for signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had not seen what I have seen over the last five or so
hours,'' said Oklahoma U.S. Rep. J. C. Watts, ``I would not have
been able to believe it, nor would I have been able to comprehend
it ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The area looks like they have taken these homes apart board by
board. It's not a pretty sight. I will be surprised if the death
toll stops at 40.''
</P>
<P>
   In Haysville, Kan., the Rev Bob Osenga said the twister carved a
quarter-mile wide, five-mile long path through the community of
14,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like bombs were just dropped in a row,'' he said
``You and I could have taken Caterpillar bulldozers and couldn't
have done a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   An oral surgeon, whose office is in the Oklahoma City suburb of
Moore, said he saw a man stumbling down the street after the storm
with a piece of wood protruding from his back. ``There was one
woman with a leg injury,'' he said. ``We put her on an ironing
board and took her to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City hospitals nearest to the main strike zone were
swamped with victims, but doctors and spokespersons said they were
able to cope with the large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Irby of the American Red Cross told The Associated Press
that 10 emergency shelters have been established in Oklahoma; three
in Kansas. The Red Cross also has dispatched 12 emergency response
vehicles to the scene, each capable of dispensing 5,000 meals
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief M. T. Berry said officers reported seeing
relatively few people in the shelters because neighbors and people
around Oklahoma City were taking them in.
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes _ some of which likely packed winds in excess of
260 mph _ grew out of a massive storm system that moved into
Central Oklahoma about 4 p.m. CST Monday. Meteorologists noted that
some of the tornadoes remained on the ground for 30 to 45 minutes.
One cut a milewide, 60-mile path through rural Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hot and humid, very oppressive,'' recalled
University of Oklahoma meteorology graduate student Marc Weinberg.
``It was perfect weather for storms to form.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, equipped with a video camera and accompanied by a
friend, began following the storm system at Cyril, about an hour's
drive southwest of Oklahoma City. At Chicasha, he encountered the
first of nine tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching within a mile of the twister, Weinberg was astounded
by the ear-shattering roar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were explosions all over the place,'' he said. ``Power
lines falling all over the road. The destruction was amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People call this an act of God,'' said Wayne Canefield, whose
elderly parents' home was destroyed in the suburban community of
Midwest City. ``This is not an act of God. The other side did
this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In Moore, houses were reduced to splinters. Automobiles were
tossed about like toys, stacked in crazy heaps on the roadways.
Trees, left standing, were stripped of their bark.
</P>
<P>
   One of the storm's miracles occurred at the West Moore High
School, where about 300 students, parents and teachers were
attending a meeting when the twisters hit. Although the school
gymnasium's roof was peeled back like a sardine can lid, no one
attending the meeting was injured.
</P>
<P>
   When they stepped into the school's debris-littered parking lot,
they found the bodies of two horses. The nearest field, locals
noted, is miles from the school.
</P>
<P>
   In Bridge Creek, a subdivision about 20 miles southwest of
Oklahoma City, National Guardsmen found a woman in the wreckage of
a church. She had spent nearly a full day in the debris, which had
fallen in such a way as to protect her from injury.
</P>
<P>
   The once-placid neighborhoods of suburban Oklahoma City offered
snapshots of despair.
</P>
<P>
   In front of one ruined house, a tattered U.S. flag was buffeted
by a 40 mph wind.
</P>
<P>
   In many neighborhoods there were no street signs left, but
families found the site of their former homes nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Families searched for mementos, photos, even things as basic as
a change of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City resident Jo Shepherd, who was in Washington, D.C.,
when the storm hit, said 16 of her family members and neighbors
emerged from her home's basement to find that a Rottweiler _
apparently blown into the home through a window _ had taken refuge
in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was paying attention,'' Shepherd's traveling companion,
Susan McMakin, said of the dog. Authorities, she noted, often
advise residents to seek shelter from storms in bathrooms. ``You've
got to laugh.'' &QL;

SALMON IS DAY-TO-DAY
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT -- Tim Salmon has made the play dozens of times, and not
once has he hurt himself doing it. But this is the Angels we're
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon tried to make a sliding catch on a sinking liner hit to
right field by the White Sox's Paul Konerko Monday afternoon. But
instead of sliding, his left knee stuck in the turf and caused him
to land awkwardly on his left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Salmon and the Angels, X-rays were negative and he
has only a sprain. He is listed as day-to-day, and Tuesday he said
it felt better even though he was not in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could slide like that a hundred times and never hurt
myself,'' Salmon said. ``It was one of those situations where I
tried to make a play when maybe I shouldn't have. ... But if you
get hurt from playing aggressively, you've got to live with that.
It wasn't a stupid play. I was trying to pick up a pitcher who's
struggling a little bit. I would have done it for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury, Salmon said, is common: ``We've all done it. You
fall off your skateboard and tweak your wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were skateboarding, Salmon could have returned Tuesday.
But swinging the bat with a bad wrist is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your bottom hand,'' Salmon said, ``and that's everything.
At least for me it is. ... My wrists are everything as far as my
swing. It's different than hobbling around the bases like I did
last year. At least I could swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon added he doesn't want to come back too soon because ``I
don't want to get into bad habits, which could result from favoring
the wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Angels already losing players like Mo Vaughn, Gary
DiSarcina and Jim Edmonds to injuries, Salmon worried that the
wrist was broken when it happened. But he stayed in the game for
another at-bat anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I couldn't swing when I was on-deck,'' Salmon said.
``But I had adrenaline going. And part of it is denial. The first
thing that went through my mind was `You've got to be kidding me.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Tim Belcher's ERA of 9.96 is the worst on the Angels
staff, starters and relievers included. But if not for the fifth
inning of his starts, Belcher's ERA would be a respectable 4.68.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher has allowed three runs or more in the fifth inning in
four of his six starts. And that includes one start in which he
didn't even reach the fifth inning. His ERA in the fifth inning is
54.00.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins, pitching coach Dick Pole and bullpen
coach Joe Coleman looked at video tape of Belcher Tuesday -- both
from games this year and last year -- in an effort to find the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get him going, he's big for us,'' Collins said.
``His ball's got life. His velocity in the fifth inning is the
same, but it's right down the middle of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he didn't think Belcher's fifth-inning woes have
become a mental problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to bother a guy like Tim Belcher,''
Collins said. ``He's been through too many wars. He's having a
tough time. I've managed a lot of 'em -- some guys aren't very good
at the start, then in June they're pitching great.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa was not available for Tuesday's
game because of food poisoning. ``He brought some noodles onto the
plane, Collins said. ``He added some hot water and immediately
started to barf. Collins jokingly called it a ``gastronomical
abnormality.'' ... With Salmon out of the lineup Tuesday, Tim Unroe
started in right field. Unroe went into the game hitting .500 (7
for 14) with one homer. Todd Greene, who will start at catcher
today, might get a start in right field if Salmon doesn't return in
the next few days. ... Last Friday, Troy Percival gave up five runs
in the ninth inning in the Angels' 8-5 loss to the White Sox. And
it happened after Hasegawa threw a 1-2-3 eighth inning. ``I had
breakfast in Seal Beach on Saturday morning, and the girl who
waited on me told me I should have left Shige in, Collins said.
``That's real easy Saturday morning. I told her `Where were you
last night? I could have used you then.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Tigers play the second game of their three-game
series today at 4:05. Steve Sparks (0-3, 5.22 ERA) will start for
Anaheim against Detroit's Jeff Weaver (3-1, 2.45).

N.Y. GOVERNOR MOVES TO TOUGHEN LAWS AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki pressed ahead Tuesday with his
effort to stiffen New York's laws against domestic violence,
proposing lifetime orders of protection, tougher bail requirements
for accused batterers and increased penalties for several offenses.
</P>
<P>
   He said his legislation would strengthen protections for victims
by insuring that judges, prosecutors and the police have more tools
to fight domestic violence, which elected officials of both major
parties have increasingly championed.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki pushed through laws in his first term that made defying
an order of protection a felony and that require Family Court
judges to consider domestic violence in child custody cases. He
also was one of the most outspoken critics of Brooklyn Criminal
Court Judge Lorin Duckman, who was later removed from the bench
after being accused of showing bias against prosecutors and
disparaging blacks and women. Duckman drew criticism in 1996 after
he lowered the bail of a man jailed on domestic abuse charges, who
was then released and who subsequently killed a former girlfriend
and himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are sweeping and comprehensive reforms that will build
on the successes we've had,'' the governor said of the proposal at
a news conference today. ``You can never do enough. We want to see
that this crime is driven out of New York State, that there is in
fact not just the talk of zero tolerance, but is in fact the action
of zero tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate, which is controlled by Pataki's Republican
allies, is all but certain to approve the legislation quickly. With
domestic violence measures popular among politicians, the
Democratic majority in the state Assembly is not likely to reject
it. But the Democrats could delay passage in a bid to obtain the
governor's support on other legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, judges can generally issue orders of
protection for up to a year, after which the orders must be
renewed. In his bill presented Tuesday, Pataki called on the
Legislature to allow judges to make the orders permanent. Only one
state, Washington, allows such lifetime orders of protection,
although judges in three other states _ New Jersey, Oklahoma and
Utah _ can issue orders of indeterminate length, aides to Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also proposed altering the way that judges consider
bail in domestic violence cases. The bill would require that judges
consider a defendant's history of domestic violence, whether an
order of protection had been previously issued against the accused
and whether there was evidence that an order had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the law would tend to increase the chances that a
defendant would not be released on bail, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that under the bill, people who engage in domestic
violence in front of children would be charged with endangering the
welfare of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the proposals in the legislation stemmed from
recommendations by a commission that Pataki established, which was
led by Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro.

TORNADO SURVIVOR: `I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Also see: Tornado-trauma, Tornado-deaths, Tornado-scene and
Tornado-weather.) 
 
By PATTI MUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORE, Okla. _ First came the softball-sized hail and the
horrible roaring wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really sounded like Armageddon,'' said Zach Whitaker, who
survived one of the monster tornadoes that tore through Oklahoma
and Kansas on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But in the aftermath came a worse sound _ the voices of
terrified neighbors searching for family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd hear, `Oh God, Oh God, please don't be dead''' said
Whitaker, who rode out the storm in a bathroom closet of his house
with his 1 1/2-year-old son, his wife and his in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   He was glad to be alive Tuesday, but forever shaken by a
life-changing act of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here all my life, and I've been through three
tornadoes, and I've never seen anything like this,'' Whitaker said.
``It came in, as they say, `like a thief in the night.'''
</P>
<P>
   For 36-year-old Chong Wren, the lights went out, and through
several minutes of darkness and stark terror, she thought her life
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `I'm going to die.' I said, `God help me, God help
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   As she huddled in a bathtub in her second-floor apartment near
Moore, a suburb of Oklahoma City, the apartment disintegrated
around her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is gone,'' she said. ``The wall is gone. The
refrigerator blew out, the oven blew out. I saw a lot of people
lying down and bleeding.``
</P>
<P>
   The stairway vanished into rubble, and she had to be rescued
before beginning a frantic search for her 6-year-old son, Alan, who
was visiting a friend.
</P>
<P>
   They were reunited at a nearby shelter, and she rejoiced at
their survival, but wept as she contemplated the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I can start all over again,'' said Wren, a
department store employee. ``I'm a single mom, working hard for
many years. I try the best I can, but I don't have insurance and my
car is gone, too.``
</P>
<P>
   Alan Wren was in a car with his best friend, Billy Webb Payne,
7, and Payne's mother, Margie Payne, 28. They sought shelter under
an interstate bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just so scared,'' said Margie Payne. ``I saw it cross
the interstate.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, Wren, Whitaker and dozens of other
victims waited desperately at a blocked intersection, unable to
reach whatever was left of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities kept them away because of downed, live electrical
wires and hissing gas lines.
</P>
<P>
   The residents' frustration peaked and replaced the fear of the
previous night as the evening curfew approached.
</P>
<P>
   One man who would not give his name complained bitterly that
some police officers and firefighters who lived in the area were
allowed in to salvage their possessions. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Just because I don't have a badge, I can't get in,'' he
fumed.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, a 21-year-old carpenter, said the family's 10-year-old
dog, Millie, refused to leave the flattened house after the tornado
and needs medication to live.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood was littered with splintered 2-by-4s, cars and
trucks thrown randomly about, and houses simply leveled, residents
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we could see it was flat,'' Whitaker said. ``My
father-in-law helped one lady with a split two-by-four stuck in her
foot. It was pretty terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kiefner, 46, an attorney whose home was demolished,
compared the scene to a ``a garbage dump _ piles of debris as far
as you can see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not expect the magnitude of the devastation. I was
unprepared for that,`` said Kiefner, who was able to salvage a few
family photographs but nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Terri, 42, a social worker, went to a
relative's house before the storm hit, and called family in Houston
soon after to say they were safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already homesick, but we're fine, and we're going to be
OK,'' said Terri Kiefner.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Oklahomans have been supportive and will help them return
to normal, they said. ``I think they know what to do and how to
pull together really quick,'' said Terri Kiefner. ``Pretty
resilient bunch of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was accounted for by Tuesday night, and neighbors
feared that some may have been trapped in rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors spread through the crowd at the blocked intersection. One
neighbor reportedly lost a leg in the storm. Another hadn't been
heard from.
</P>
<P>
   And there in the crowd, holding a sign high above her head,
Oklahoma City resident Charlene Jay and her 10-year-old son
searched for two people they don't even know.
</P>
<P>
   A man working with Jay's husband on a job site in Texas lived in
the neighborhood, and was desperate for word of his wife and
10-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Jay, 37, a homemaker, carried a sign asking for information
about the pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've called five shelters and left my name everywhere,'' Jay
said.

 &HT;    Larkin like old self, leads Reds to win
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ It must be May because Barry Larkin is bustin' out
all over.
</P>
<P>
   After another of his yearly stumbles through April, living in
below .200 poverty, the 35-year-old captain of The Good Ship
Cincinnati Reds, which took on a lot of water in April, is his old
self again.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin broke a tie game Tuesday night with a two-run home run to
lift the Reds to a 6-4 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks in
Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin also was in the middle of two-run rallies in the second
and fourth and scored three times. On Monday, during a 4-3 victory,
Larkin had two hits and drove in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the 600th of manager Jack McKeon's managerial
career in this, his 50th year of professional baseball, and added a
few gray hairs under his hat, thanks to wobbly starting pitcher
again by Jason Bere.
</P>
<P>
   Bere had the most deceiving 2-0 record imaginable when he took
the mound, having pitched beyond 5 1/3 innings only once in five
starts. His 6.00 earned run average said it all.
</P>
<P>
   His spot in the rotation was precarious and he did nothing to
change it.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds gave him a 2-0 lead in the second on catcher Brian
Johnson's two-run double, but Arizona ripped into Bere for four
runs in the third, including a three-run home run by Matt Williams,
his 11th.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds tied it in the fourth on Pokey Reese's two-out,
two-strike, two-run single and McKeon permitted Bere to bat.
</P>
<P>
   After Bere struck out, he walked to the mound in the fifth and
promptly walked Luis Gonzalez on four pitches and surrendered a
double to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gonzalez was caught off third base on the Wiliams
double, an awful piece of base-running, McKeon had seen enough and
hooked Bere.
</P>
<P>
   In four-plus innings, Bere had given up four runs, eight hits
and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds had gone 13 straight innings without back-to-back hits,
and only once in their previous 34 innings, when the second inning
began against Arizona left-hander Omar Daal.
</P>
<P>
   That ended after Greg Vaughn reached first on shortstop Andy
Fox's error. Aaron Boone singled and Johnson followed with his
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds put back-to-back hits together again in the two-run
fourth when Vaughn and Larkin opened with singles. It looked
fruitless when Daal struck out Boone and Johnson, but Reese slapped
his two-run single to make it 4-4.

 &HT;    Miami clinches top seed in East, 93-79
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With smothering playoff-caliber defense, the Miami
Heat beat the Atlanta Hawks 93-79 Tuesday night to clinch the No. 1
seed in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, who also won a third consecutive Atlantic Division
title, are assured of the home-court advantage through the Eastern
Conference finals. The Hawks were eliminated from contention for
the Central Division title and were swept in the three-game season
series.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Mashburn scored 18 points and P.J. Brown 16 to lead
Miami's offense, but it was the defense that made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks shot just 27 percent in the final three quarters, and
the Heat forced six turnovers in the pivotal third period while
taking the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith scored 21 points for Atlanta but missed 11 of 18
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks were surprisingly sharp from the outset, a marked
contrast to recent performances even while they were winning eight
of their previous nine.
</P>
<P>
   Their passes were crisp and they ran their plays precisely. With
Smith and Mookie Blaylock both sharp, the result was a terrific 8
1/2 minutes in which they grabbed a 21-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smith made his first four shots and was 6-for-11 in the opening
half while Blaylock hit 5-for-7, including both 3-pointers he
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the opening basket of the game, Miami could not get
the lead until a 6-0 surge with Clarence Weatherspoon sinking a
baseline jumper to make it 39-37.
</P>
<P>
   In marked contrast to their previous appearance here, the Hawks
dug in. They held a narrow lead into Miami's final possession of
the half, when Terry Porter sank an open 3-pointer to tie it
45-all.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's offense came from three players, Mashburn, Brown and
Weatherspoon combining for 33 of their points.
</P>
<P>
   Had they been as good at the line as they were in other
departments, the Hawks would have led. Alonzo Mourning and
Weatherspoon both worked into foul trouble, giving the Hawks 15
free throws in the half, but they missed six.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum swing came for Miami in the third quarter with the
score tied at 49. It started with Brown at his favorite spot,
sinking a right baseline jumper. Then it was Hardaway from nearly
the same spot, then for a 3-pointer. When Dikembe Mutombo
goaltended Brown's hook, the Heat was on an 8-1 run and leading by
six.

   ATLANTA _ For the seconds it took a Mark McGwire home run to
sail 429 feet on Tuesday night, 39,161 fans at Turner Field caught
a glimpse of the hype.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Braves fans and their pitchers had managed to steer
pretty clear of McGwire and his Chase, but this time they had
nowhere to run.
</P>
<P>
   Captured in a sea of flashbulbs, McGwire unleashed a little of
what fans all over the nation saw last year _ a ball rocketing
through the night _ for a grand slam in the second inning, a
six-run lead and a hold on the game the Cardinals would not lose.
</P>
<P>
   They slammed shut a six-game Braves win streak with a 9-1
victory of their own. The Braves, 10-5 at Turner Field, will wrap
up a nine-game homestand today against the Cardinals at 1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The only drama that followed the home run was two bench-clearing
meetings on the infield in response to Greg Maddux plunking Ray
Lankford after the McGwire grand slam and Kent Mercker's
retaliatory pitch aimed at Andruw Jones to start the bottom half of
the second inning. Mercker, whose pitch went behind Jones, was
ejected.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who had hit his two of his record-setting 70 home runs
off Dennis Martinez and Kevin Millwood last year at Busch Stadium,
got his first career home run in Turner Field, first ever off
Maddux, sixth of the season and 12th grand slam of his career,
which leads all active hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, McGwire had been 1-for-5 in the series and 11-for-51
(.216) in his career against the Braves with three home runs.
</P>
<P>
   One inning made it a night of frustration for Maddux, who had
flirted with this kind of disaster in an April 24 start in Florida
but didn't have to watch it play out, thanks to eight Braves runs
in an 8-7 win. This time he left trailing 8-0 after Joseph McEwing
got his third hit in three at-bats with a two-run bases-loaded
single in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Maddux (4-1) was finished with his shortest outing of
the year (4 1/3 innings). He had surrendered a season-high 12 hits
and eight earned runs, matching his career high for earned runs
allowed.

   FORT DIX, N.J. _ As relief workers in Macedonia took the final
steps toward sending some 400 Kosovar Albanian refugees to the
United States on Tuesday, parishioners at the Church of the Good
Shepherd in Willingboro, N.J., put together ``shoe box ministries''
_ boxes stuffed with shampoo, toothbrushes and other essentials
that people uprooted from their homes would most likely miss.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Fort Dix, a nearby Army base that was established during
World War I, the mess hall was being outfitted as a medical
station, while a team of budget analysts turned off their computers
to parcel out linens and towels in the newly cleaned dormitories.
Soldiers trained to fire heavy weapons were instead assembling
bassinets and bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing whatever it takes to make the kids happy,'' said
Pvt. Joshua Bennett, 18, as he put together an indoor basketball
game.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, the first 400 of about 20,000 Kosovar
Albanian refugees that the United States has agreed to shelter are
expected to arrive on a charter plane at nearby McGuire Air Force
Base, where they will be greeted by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Gov.
Christie Whitman. A second planeload of 400 or so refugees is
expected to arrive Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers will be mostly women and children whose families
have been decimated by the Serbian campaign to redraw the ethnic
map of Kosovo through violence.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the families arriving here will not have
relatives in the United States, and will encounter an array of
government and nonprofit agencies, including the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, Health and Human Services and the private
Immigration and Refugee Services of America.
</P>
<P>
   They will remain at the base for three to six weeks, and
eventually be resettled in communities throughout the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, an additional 300 Albanian refugees will fly into
Kennedy International Airport. But these have relatives in the
United States who have agreed to take them in and who are expected
to welcome them at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Those coming here to Fort Dix will be sheltered in barracks
previously used for reservists during their annual training.
Contractors have been reconfiguring the rooms to house families of
varying sizes. Bilingual signs have gone up, and buildings that had
been quiet were bustling Tuesday with final preparations.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, as the Defense Department began closing
bases around the country, the community here fought to keep McGuire
Air Force Base open. It succeeded, but operations were scaled back.
In 1995, the Army stopped using Fort Dix for basic training, and
laid off many civilian employees.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Anna Hinkle, 62, was one of them. She worked in the mess
hall until 1995. Tuesday, she wore bright yellow plastic gloves as
she cleaned the corridors for the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might start working there again, because I know all sides of
the mess hall operation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hinkle came to the United States herself as a refugee in
1946, after World War II. She had been expelled from the
Sudetenland, a region of Czechoslovakia that Germany had invaded in
Hitler's first expansionist drive.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the refugees from Kosovo now, she said, ``brings
memories.'' Her own family left its home practically penniless, and
came to the United States along with 3,000 or so other refugees,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a child, and didn't understand,'' she said. ``Now, I do,
and I help.''

   OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla._ Under clear skies, tens of thousands of
residents across two states began grappling Tuesday with the
aftermath of a series of monster tornadoes that killed at least 43
people, injured more than 500, destroyed more than 1,500 buildings
and left behind mile after mile of twisted metal, denuded trees,
crumpled cars and collapsed buildings. Standing in the anonymous
rubble of their communities, they stared, shook their heads and
joked ruefully, hoping to find some shard of their former lives
that had escaped the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce line of storms roared across Oklahoma and southern
Kansas late Monday, unleashing an unknown number of twisters
including one particularly brutal one that authorities said was at
times as wide as a mile.
</P>
<P>
   That particular tornado _ which some experts said might have
risen to the level of F5, the strongest classification _ gouged the
southern edge of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. It wiped more
than 200 homes over eight acres in the suburb of Moore off their
foundations like ice scraped off a windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they expected the death toll to rise.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, officials still could not determine how
widespread the damage was and how extensive the injuries, though at
least 1,500 buildings, both homes and businesses, appeared to have
been damaged or destroyed in Oklahoma on Monday night.At least 200
buildings were hit in southern Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The dead came from all across central Oklahoma, from Oklahoma
City, the suburbs of Moore, Midwest City, Del City and Norman.
Eleven of the dead came from one town, Bridge Creek, about 30 miles
southwest of the capital, near where the largest tornado hit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, five people were killed by a separate tornado that
hit Haysville, Kan., a town of 8,000 south of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   News was still straggling in from damage in small towns and
rural areas across the region while, in Oklahoma City, some 750
National Guard troops helped local officials and rescue dogs make
two, initial searches of the devastated areas around Oklahoma City
on Tuesday in a search for those who might still be trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City Fire Chief Gary Morris said Tuesday afternoon that
no one had been found in the rubble during these forays so
officials were ready to make a third and more substantial search.
``The first two searches we did were very cursory and preliminary
and we're ready to go back in with some heavy equipment and some of
the structures that are most heavily damaged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many were reminded of the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City in April 1995
that left 168 dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like eight or nine Murrah buildings scattered around
the city,'' said Congressman J.C. Watts. ``I've seen everything
from a mother in a hospital not knowing where her two sons are to a
family holding a wicker basket saying this is all we have to start
over with.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared Oklahoma a federal disaster area. A
separate declaration for parts of Kansas was also in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Oklahoma City, in particular, have suffered too
much devastation in recent years and they have been hit very, very
hard by this,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes often stay on the ground for very short periods of
time, sometimes rising into the sky and then dropping down again,
bouncing along the countryside. But the largest of Monday's
twisters, the one that ravaged south of Oklahoma City, was
reportedly on the ground for four hours. Paul G. Knight, another
Penn State meteorologist, said this was ``extraordinary,'' but that
tornadoes which stay on the ground an hour or two probably develop
at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, it goes through Farmer Joe's field,'' he
said, and so the impact is largely unappreciated. Longer-lived
tornadoes than Monday's have happened in the past. The longest, he
said, is believed to have been set by a 1925 twister that was on
the ground for seven hours, wiping out several towns in Missouri,
Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, bulldozers had begun to push into the most
devastated neighborhoods, helicopters moved overhead and the
intermittent sound of chain saws could be heard through the roar of
the wind. In those hardest hit areas, most of the houses had been
stripped of walls and roofing, not a leaf remained on the trees,
many of which were strewn with bits of metal and wood like gruesome
ornaments. At one home, shirts flapped from their hangers in a
closet that had lost its walls, and curtains waved like pennants
through yawning, glassless windows.
</P>
<P>
   Long sheets of metal, apparently roofing material, hung from the
few remaining power lines.Oddly, the lines themselves had not been
pulled down.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were being allowed into many of the hard hit areas,
though those attempting to get inside were asked to show officials
photo identification. A 6:30 p.m. curfew was put into place. In
those areas where the structures appeared most precarious,
residents were still being kept out Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Kathi R. Ferguson, 38, collapsed against her mother as she
looked at the wreckage of her Moore home. ``I spent most of my life
in that house,'' she said through sobs. Ferguson had rushed from
her home in Tulsa to find her parents and see what had become of
the brick house where she had lived for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't collapse, it blew away,'' said Clifford L. Dodson,
73, her father, a retired FAA technician.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dodson's sons-in-law, Brent K. Mackay, 34, tried to clear
rubble from what had been the front door. He lives nearby, but
authorities had not allowed him to go to his home, which was also
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's storm started in southwestern Oklahoma near the town of
Lawton, said Paul Janish, a meteorologist with the National Storm
Prediction Center. The storm rapidly became severe and produced a
string of several, short-lived tornadoes. The storm grew as it
moved northeast at about 30 mph, eventually producing larger
tornadoes as it approached Oklahoma City, Janish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around 7 p.m. the storm intensified into a large super cell
storm and produced a very large, violent tornado,'' he said. The
tornado touched down north of Chickasha, 26 miles southwest of the
capital, and stayed on the ground until it reached Tinker Air Force
Base, just east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The storm system moved across southern Oklahoma City, through
the town of Moore and continued northeast until it wiped out a
factory outlet mall near the town of Stroud, between Oklahoma City
and Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   The storm produced tornadoes for over a 100-mile track, Janish
said. ``It wasn't a continuous tornado, but during the entire path
was producing tornadoes almost continuously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This was all ``very extraordinary,'' Janish said, because
``typically what happens when we get a thunderstorm that produces a
tornado, the tornado will go through its life cycle and weaken in a
short period of time and then the storm may produce another.''
</P>
<P>
   But this particular twister had an unusually long life cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average life span of any given tornado is probably less
than 10 minutes,'' Janish said. ``This tornado not only unusually
large and long lived but unusually destructive in its wind speeds.
It's definitely one of the longer track tornadoes you'll ever
see.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The tornado was mainly at a level of F4, with winds speeds
between 207 and 260 mph. At that intensity houses are leveled or
blown off their foundations and cars can be thrown, Janish said. At
F5, winds speeds are as high as 318 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that even though these tornadoes apparently ranked
among the most powerful of their breed, there was nothing out of
the ordinary about them, meteorologically speaking. ``It's spring,
it's Oklahoma, and tornadoes and even strong tornadoes are not
unusual,'' said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist with the
Pennsylvania State University Weather Communications Group.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes materialize within large thunderstorms, which in this
case were produced by a clash of cold air from the west with warm,
moist air to the east. They often appear on the southern Great
Plains in the spring, in an area of Oklahoma and Kansas nicknamed
Tornado Alley.
</P>
<P>
   What made Monday's disaster unusual, Gadomski said, was that
``by the luck of the draw, the tornadoes went through a relatively
heavily populated neck of the woods.'' The chances that one of the
most powerful class of tornadoes ``will go over any individual spot
in a person's lifetime is on the order of one in 10 million,'' he
said, ``even in Tornado Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said 45 tornado sightings in
Oklahoma were reported on Monday, more than half the total for all
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the tornadoes continued Tuesday at the juncture of Texas,
Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. At least one person was killed in
Titus County, Texas, and 11 were injured in DeKalb.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A tornado outbreak in Florida last year led to 42 deaths, while
90 people were killed by tornadoes associated with a 1985 storm in
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Ontario and more than 300 were killed by
what meteorologists call a ``super outbreak'' of some 118 tornadoes
during a two-day storm in April 1974 over 11 midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Marty and Vernoia Bernich survived Monday's storm with their two
daughters at their brick-and-frame home in the Highland Park
neighborhood on the south side of Moore. ``We huddled in a hallway
under a mattress,'' Bernich said. ``We could feel ourselves
elevated, you know, like up to the sky. We could hear things
smashing around us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, Bernich surveyed what was left of his
house. ``There's nothing left,'' he said. An art educator and
potter, Bernich stood amid shards of his work that littered what
was left of his living room while, eerily, several of his other
pots still sat on shelves, inches away, upright and untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Bernich was angry that state officials were not allowing him to
bring more vehicles into the area to cart away more of his damaged
goods. ``I just need a little empathy,'' he said to one official,
barely holding back his anger. ``My home has been put in a blender
and we're being treated like Kosovo refugees. Just allow us to take
whatever is left.''
</P>
<P>
   But government officials, worried about a traffic jam in the
debris-clogged streets, were keeping vehicles to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy L. Staggs, 35, a forklift operator, was trying to maneuver
a truck load of recovered household goods from the wreckage of the
three-bedroom home she shared not far from the Berniches with
Michele D. Moore, 34. It was like threading a needle as the truck
squeezed between piles of metal, sheet rock and brick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just moved in two weeks ago,'' said Ms. Moore, a machinist
in Norman. ``That's all you can do, just start over. We had just
put in new wallpaper, just settled in, when this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore had been away when Monday's storm him, but Ms. Staggs
was there, huddled beneath a mattress in a central hallway with
their two dogs. ``You take for granted that it won't happen to
you,'' Ms. Staggs said. ``I've never seen anything like this,
except for on TV. We're shook up and bruised up, but we're fine.''
Including the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In Moore, where the twister cut a three-mile long swath at least
five to six blocks wide through the city, assistant fire chief
Terry Schatt said officials were still assessing the damage though
at least one victim was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pretty much demolished everything along its path through
here and we're still not sure what we're going to find when we
bring in the heavy equipment,'' he said. ``There may be more bodies
or we may have gotten them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakeside Golf Course in Moore, which was renovated last
year, was a wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   Joe O'Bryant, 60, the superintendent there, said that he had
been watching television news about the coming storm in his trailer
by the side of the course when he decided to head for a sturdier
building. He got to the clubhouse just in time to see the half-mile
wide tornado cross the highway that abuts the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see trees in it, flying around,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   He ran into the restroom, and felt the walls collapse around
him. He was pinned beneath a crumbled wall, hugging a bar stool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about 45 minutes to dig me out,'' said O'Bryant.
``When I got out I was shocked. I thought that maybe the roof had
collapsed. But the whole building was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The clubhouse was reduced to a pile of loose cinder blocks,
splintered bits of wood, scores of mangled irons and muddy balls
and twisted wrecks of green golf carts piled on top of each other.
The only trace of O'Bryant's trailer was a muddy plot of land where
it had once stood. Bits of the chassis were found 500 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   In the 400-home Highland Park neighborhood, evidence of the
storm's destructive power stretched as far as the eye could see:
block after block of destroyed houses and smashed automobiles;
mounds of splintered lumber and twisted wiring; toppled signs
uprooted from their concrete bases; trees stripped of leaves and
bark.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Bennett, an Assembly of God pastor from a nearby
community, stood at an intersection in Highland Park and offered
counseling to residents leaving the neighborhood. ``We've got a
hundred families in there that are survivors, but they're just not
ready to come out. They want to stay with their homes and see what
they can save,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dazed residents picked through unrecognizable stacks of debris,
searching for familiar objects or valuables. One woman sat on the
steps of her front porch _ almost all that remained of her house _
and hugged a barking German shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks more like a bombing than a storm,'' said Billie Sue
Rhodes, 69, as she plucked a framed photograph from a pile of
wreckage. Rhodes and her husband, Thurman, 73, were at home when
the tornado struck and took refuge together in a closet. It is the
only part of the house still standing. At one point during the
storm, Rhodes had left the closet to retrieve his glasses and the
wind threatened to carry him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't get back inside to the closet and if she
hadn't grabbed me and hung on till the wind laid down, I wouldn't
be here. She's a real hero to me, but I guess she has been for 49
years,'' said Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who said he has suffered three recent strokes, said the
couple had lost everything in the storm and would probably have to
move into an assisted living facility. As he rested against an
overturned television cabinet in what once was his living room,
Rhodes reflected on the results of the last 24 hours: ``Liked to
have kept the house, but the storm took care of that; would have
liked to have kept the car, but I don't really need it. At least
we've still got each other.''  &QL;

DOCTORS WHO ADVERTISE ARE LIABLE UNDER CONSUMER LAWS, COURT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors and other medical providers who advertise their services
can be held liable under New York's consumer fraud and false
advertising laws just like car dealers, clothing stores or any
other kind of business, the state's highest court ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision by the state Court of Appeals essentially
upheld longstanding practices by state and city officials, who have
pursued cases of false medical advertising and fraud under consumer
laws. But the ruling is likely to encourage more individual civil
cases under the laws, because the consumer cases tend to be easier
for patients to win than cases alleging medical malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also reflected a fact apparent to anyone who opens
the Yellow Pages or rides a subway: Doctors and managed-care
companies, in heated competition, advertise much more _ and more
boldly _ than they did even a few years ago. And so, as with other
businesses, the chances of deceptive ads have increased.
</P>
<P>
   In the case before the Court of Appeals, a New York state
couple, Jayne and Kenneth Karlin, sued a company that provides
services to doctors who perform fertility treatments. The Karlins
said in court papers filed in 1994 that they had been assured by
the company's brochures that women who completed four in vitro
fertilization procedures generally had a 50 percent chance of
becoming pregnant. But the couple underwent seven such procedures
over two and a half years at a hospital in Port Chester, N.Y., and
the woman did not become pregnant. They claimed that the company
overstated its success rates, and that the company's advertising
did not disclose potential risks from fertilization procedures like
high miscarriage rates, neonatal deaths and birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Before the couple filed their suit, the company, based in
Purchase, N.Y., and then known as IVF America, was accused of
deceptive advertising by the Federal Trade Commission in 1990. The
company agreed to stop misrepresenting success rates from
fertilization procedures. And three years later, the company was
charged with similar violations of New York City's consumer
protection laws and settled that case.
</P>
<P>
   But in the summer of 1997, the appellate division of state
Supreme Court refused to allow the Karlins to pursue their case
under false advertising and consumer fraud laws because it said
that opening doctors up to such cases would represent a ``drastic
change in basic tort law.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's decision, Chief Judge Judith Kaye ruled that the
lower court was mistaken and that there was no reason to exempt
medical providers from the laws that cover other businesses. She
wrote that ``when they choose to reach out to the consuming public
at large in order to promote business _ like clothing retailers,
automobile dealers and wedding singers _ they subject themselves to
the standards of an honest marketplace'' protected by the consumer
fraud laws.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Court of Appeals added that Kaye's language
was also meant to be a warning to lawyers and other professionals
who have recently begun to advertise in ways more often associated
with used car lots or electronics store close-outs.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Burman, the Karlins' lawyer, said Tuesday that the
couple did not wish to comment publicly about the decision, which
returns their case to Supreme Court in Westchester County for a
trial. But Burnham said the couple, who also did not want to
disclose their professions or where they live, were elated.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ledy-Gurren, the lawyer for the company, now known as
IntegraMed America, said she remained ``very confident that a trial
on the merits will be in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the success rates were honestly and thoroughly
communicated to the Karlins,'' she said. She added that she fears
the ``effect of this decision will be less dissemination of
information for medical consumers. I suspect that the flow of
information _ particularly on the Internet _ will be curtailed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, whose office
has pursued consumer fraud cases against health care providers,
said that would be better than a surfeit of false information.
``Just as we are trying to insure that people can obtain the care
they need, particularly from managed care companies,'' he said,
``we have to make sure that representations about the quality of
the care they can obtain are verifiable.''

SEC COMMISSIONER STRONGLY CRITICAL OF METHODS OF ONLINE BROKERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Maybe some tow-truck drivers do own islands that
they bought with profits from trading stocks online.
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said Tuesday that he thought brokerage industry
advertisements focusing on the get-rich aspect of online investing
were doing more harm than good for both Wall Street and the public.
</P>
<P>
   In a stinging rebuke to the companies that have aggressively
promoted such ``grandiose and unrealistic expectations,'' Levitt
said that even ads intending to offer a tongue-in-cheek look at the
potential rewards of online investing trivialized what to most
Americans is an important, and often confusing, responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt also admonished individual investors to better educate
themselves about online trading and whether it was appropriate for
them. But to a greater extent than before, he focused the spotlight
on whether brokerage firms were being honest in portraying the
potential risks and rewards of online trading.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt, who made his remarks in a speech at the National Press
Club, also called on brokerage firms to strengthen their disclosure
of the risks of trading stocks over the Internet. And he disclosed
that the commission, which plans to double the number of agents
policing the Internet for investment fraud, is preparing a new
round of enforcement actions against firms that have misused the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers,
which governs securities firms, are about two-thirds of the way
through a sweep of online brokerage and day-trading firms to assess
their compliance with regulations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the results of those examinations give Levitt cause to
worry. ``Based on our initial findings, I sent a letter this
morning to all of the online brokerage firms asking them to improve
the quality of their disclosure to investors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Levitt said, he does not think new regulations are
necessary to oversee online investment. ``Yet there may come a time
when the SEC sees a need for new approaches to better meet the
imperatives of the Internet,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt also made clear that he was bothered by commercials that
imply that teen-agers who trade online can afford their own
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't accept the notion that tongue-in-cheek is all there is
to it,'' Levitt said. Without mentioning the firm, Levitt cited a
well-known ad for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Discover online
brokerage unit, which portrays a tow truck driver who bought an
island with his trading profits as one that ``trivializes a process
that is so crucial and so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt acknowledged that the SEC does not directly regulate
brokerage advertising, which is instead the purview of the
regulatory unit of the NASD. ``But nobody is going to stop me from
giving my own feelings to you about advertising that may be cute
but is ultimately demeaning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt announced that he had asked that the NASD conduct a
round-table discussion with brokerage firms and advertising
professionals to help improve fairness in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Schapiro, president of the NASD regulatory unit, said she,
too, was concerned about the tenor of recent online brokerage ads.
``They have failed to be truly balanced in disclosing the risks as
well as the benefits'' of online trading, she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One willing participant in the organization's round-table
discussion, tentatively scheduled for mid-June, is Discover
Brokerage Direct, the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter unit that ran the
ads that drew Levitt's ire. Wesley McDade, a spokesman for the
brokerage unit, said the firm ``would welcome the opportunity to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt also announced the formation of an advisory group to help
the commission examine issues specific to online trading. And to
better enforce the rules in a rapidly changing industry, the SEC
would double, to 250 lawyers, the number of people the commission
has working to uncover investment fraud on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has already asked for an $11 million increase in
its budget for the 2000 fiscal year to expand its efforts to combat
Internet fraud, he said. Tuesday, the White House said it would ask
Congress to approve an additional $5.5 million for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is also working with the FBI on a project called
``Operation Investnet,'' to address fraud on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the brokerage firms themselves who might have the
greatest effect on investors but who are not doing what they should
to educate their customers, Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   While most online brokerage firms address the different types of
orders for trades that investors can enter into the system, ``fewer
firms discuss how market volatility and the use of margin can
affect online investors, and almost none talk about the risks or
what to do in the event of system capacity and outage problems,''
Levitt said. &QL;

LAKERS FOCUSED ON DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last week it was Robert Horry, pounding Portland
with a season-high 22 points. Sunday it was Rick Fox, squashing
Seattle with big plays down the stretch. Monday, it was Glen Rice
(22 points) and Kobe Bryant (10 assists) dispatching Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have won three straight, their rhythm has returned,
and Shaquille O'Neal seemingly has found help just in time for the
playoffs. But the reason for the outstanding offense and breakout
performances lies on the other end of the court, with a renewed
dedication to defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all starts with our defense, as evidenced by the last few
games,'' Lakers point guard Derek Fisher said. ``The defense turns
into offense. We're never going to be great at executing or being a
half-court offensive team, but if we get stops and turnovers and
rebounds, that gives us more opportunities to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's giving extra effort to be better on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In their lengthy team meeting last week after the embarrassing
losses to Houston and San Antonio, the Lakers covered every subject
imaginable _ from contracts to opponents to relationships and
paychecks. And they spent a good portion of the day discussing
defense _ or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, they held Portland to 40 percent shooting. They
held Seattle to 37.5 percent Sunday. And Dallas managed just 15
points in the decisive third quarter Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They're communicating. They're rotating. They're watching each
other's back. Bryant, Fisher, O'Neal, even Rice.
</P>
<P>
   No, make that !ital!especially Rice, the sharp-shooting small
forward whose porous defense received more attention than his
errant jumper during the losing days of March and April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen's defense has been phenomenal,'' Lakers coach Kurt Rambis
said. ``It's been a major pleasant surprise for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rice: ``If we're going to be a championship team, we have
to focus on defense first. We've tried to do that the past week.''
</P>
<P>
   Home or road? The Lakers are taking a detached approach to the
home-court advantage competition with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Houston wallowing in self-pity if they don't get
it, and I don't see us doing that, either,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers are thrilled to conclude the regular season
against Portland, which has won two of three meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good we close out the season against a formidable
opponent like Portland,'' Fisher said. ``It's an opportunity once
again to gauge where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy day: The Lakers gathered for an 11 a.m. video session
Tuesday. After 30 minutes, Rambis was so impressed he gave the
veterans the rest of the day off. Meanwhile, he played
three-on-three with the younger guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten to the point where guys are seeing the video and
acknowledging their mistakes. They're saying, `I should have passed
one more time.' They're even jokingly getting on someone when
something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their willingness to accept constructive criticism is a real
good sign.''

EDITORIAL: SPEAKER HASTERT, AWOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 5:
</P>
<P>
   After Newt Gingrich, Republicans no doubt wanted a speaker who
was not a revolutionary. But the question is whether House Speaker
Dennis Hastert is prepared to lead at all. Lately he has yielded
his authority to Tom DeLay, the highly partisan Republican whip,
who undercut Hastert last week by working to defeat a resolution
backing military action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the speaker has a chance to assert himself. Moderate
Republicans are to meet with him to ask for an early vote on the
campaign finance reform legislation sponsored by Reps. Christopher
Shays of Connecticut and Martin Meehan of Massachusetts. Hastert
should break with DeLay, who is trying to kill the bill, and
listen. He needs to act like the speaker he promised to be.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the Shays-Meehan ban on ``soft money'' last
year, 252 to 179. Its support is even greater this year, with 54
Republicans on record in favor. That is why opponents prefer to
postpone consideration of the bill until late in the year, when
there may not be enough time to overcome a GOP filibuster in the
Senate. So far, Hastert has sided with those trying to run out the
clock.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, Zach Wamp of Tennessee and 27
other Republicans who asked for the meeting with Hastert must make
it clear that if he refuses to budge, they will join with the 190
Democrats who have signed a petition bringing the bill to the
floor. An additional 28 signatures would do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert pleads that the House has a busy calendar. This is
nonsense. The House has found time to amend the Death on the High
Seas Act and issue a Leif Ericson Millennium Coin. Hastert also
managed last week to squeeze in a Republican fund-raising dinner
that brought in $14 million, including a large slug of the
unrestricted corporate donations that would be banned by the
Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker has been getting poor reviews lately, especially
after the Kosovo vote fiasco. He voted to support the air attacks
and reportedly assured the White House that there would be enough
Republican votes for a resolution to pass. Then he sat by while
DeLay exhorted fellow Republicans to vote no, labeling the Kosovo
tragedy as ``Clinton's war.'' Last year Hastert won the speakership
with the active lobbying of DeLay, who now seems to be calling the
shots.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is also behind the drive to double the administration's
request for emergency military appropriations. But his most visible
effort has been to oppose the Shays-Meehan legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The danger now is in the faint-heartedness of Shays and other
Republican supporters of the bill. They say they do not want to
embarrass Hastert with a petition bringing campaign reform to the
floor. But no Republican member could embarrass the speaker more
than DeLay did last week. Republican moderates, who can determine
the bill's success in the House, have a higher obligation than
making nice to their speaker. They need to tell him so today. &QL;

YANKS, PLAYING BAD BASEBALL, LOSE A STINKER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Something is missing. Maybe it's Joe Torre, or
perhaps depth on their bench, or the calming presence of veteran
Tim Raines. Maybe it's simply unfair to measure the 1999 Yankees
against the incredible standard of concentration they established
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But they are playing bad baseball these days, even when they win
and especially when they lose, as they did in a 8-5 stinker against
the Minnesota Twins Tuesday night, despite two home runs from
Bernie Williams. Last year, the Yankees lost only four of 21 games
against Minnesota and Kansas City, bottom-dwellers in the American
League. The Yankees have lost three games in the last five days to
the Twins and Royals, and they are 6-9 in road games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lincoln, a 24-year-old right-hander who was in Class AA
last year, pitched exceptionally well against the Yankees in
collecting his first major league victory Tuesday night. Lincoln
didn't reach a three-ball count until the sixth inning, after
facing 20 batters, and for this he deserves much credit. But the
Yankees fell behind early, playing as if they had spent the last
three months ice fishing for walleye on Minnesota's Lake Mille
Lacs, moving and reacting numbly, committing errors and bumbling
constantly.
</P>
<P>
   The work of advance scouts is revealed in the first game between
two teams in any season, because strategy is implemented at the
first opportunity. The Twins tried to do a number of things against
the Yankees Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   They challenged the defense of left fielder Ricky Ledee, whose
stock continues to plummet. When Doug Mientkiewicz singled to left
field with two out in the first inning, Matt Lawton raced around
third, and Ledee's throw sailed 30 feet up the first base line; had
Ron Coomer, the runner turning at second, been more aggressive, he
could have taken third base easily.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer then tried to score when Terry Steinbach singled to left
and was thrown out when Jorge Posada made a nice catch and tag. The
scoring attempts by Lawton and Coomer seemed like just a matter of
third base coach Ron Gardenhire forcing the issue with two outs.
But in the inning that followed, Cristian Guzman tagged up at first
base on a fly ball to Ledee, taking second with a slide. Ledee
tends to catch fly balls flat-footed and is in a horrible position
to throw when he receives the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the seventh Gardenhire sent Coomer again from second
on a base hit to Ledee, and Coomer scored easily with no one out.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins, like other teams, buried Posada with breaking balls
when he was batting. Lincoln threw five pitches to Posada in his
first at-bat, all breaking balls, all about the same speed (74 to
77 mph), until Posada struck out swinging. In Posada's second
at-bat, three innings later, Lincoln threw a fastball for a
first-pitch strike, then four straight curveballs, the count moving
to two balls and two strikes. With Posada looking for a breaking
ball, Lincoln zipped a fastball over the outside corner. Posada
stared helplessly: Strike three. He has only five hits in 40
at-bats as a left-handed hitter, for a .125 average.
</P>
<P>
   But there were moments when the Twins needed no catalogues of
intelligence to beat the Yankees, because the Yankees were handling
that themselves, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   They lead the American League East, they have 16 victories in 25
games, and at that pace they would win 103 games. But the Yankees
are playing poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not played the kind of baseball these guys are capable
of,'' Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim manager, said before batting
practice Tuesday. ``That'll come, and it'll happen tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Todd Walker slapped a double to the left field corner in
the first inning and took third on a ground ball. Mendoza threw a
sinking fastball for strike two _ and it slammed through the mitt
of Posada, between his legs and to the backstop. Walker lurched off
third and scored, with Posada grimacing disgustedly as he jogged to
retrieve the ball. Already this year Posada has six passed balls,
after he had seven for the entire 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota led, 2-0, after the first, and added another run in
the second, its rally beginning when Chuck Knoblauch threw errantly
to first base, his fifth error of the season. Four of his five
errors have come on throws, and he is tied for the most errors
among second basemen in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, too, committed a costly error, throwing the ball
away on a ground ball starting the bottom of the sixth inning.
Torri Hunter ended up at second base as the Yankees scurried to
retrieve Jeter's bouncing underthrow, and the play was charitably
scored a hit and an error. Two outs into the inning, Coomer tripled
and Mientkiewicz singled. The Twins had control, 5-1, and it was
one of those rare moments when the Yankees looked demoralized.

ON ROAD TO CUP, DEVILS TAKE FIRST EXIT
</HEADLINE>
   (With HKN-ANDERSON-COLUMN)

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils, who captured the Stanley Cup
four years ago, are establishing an embarrassing legacy of thriving
in the regular season and not surviving in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the Devils made an abrupt exit in
the first round of the playoffs after finishing atop the Eastern
Conference standing in the regular season. This time they suffered
a stunning 4-2 loss Tuesday night to Pittsburgh and Jaromir Jagr in
Game 7 of this playoff series at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   After leading by three games to two against the Penguins, seeded
eighth in the conference, the top-seeded Devils caved in against a
team that did not have Jagr, its best player, for four games in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, whose game-tying and game-winning goals in game 6 rescued
Pittsburgh, had two assists Tuesday night for the Penguins, who had
only 13 shots on goal, just three in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better team sometimes doesn't win a seven-game series,''
said Bobby Holik, who finished as the leading scorer in the series
for the Devils with seven points, all from assists.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyle Odelein, who made few mistakes on defense for the
Devils, gave Pittsburgh credit. ``They played with desperation and
they have a great player,'' Odelein said, referring to Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons ago, the Devils made it through the first round,
only to lose to the Rangers in round two. Last season, the Devils'
first-round loss was to the Ottawa Senators, who also were seeded
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   This season, New Jersey, Ottawa and Carolina _ the top three
seeds in the Eastern Conference _ were eliminated in the first
round. Boston will meet Buffalo in the second round and Pittsburgh
will play Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins never trailed Tuesday night after getting the first
goal of the game in the second period from German Titov. After the
Devils' Jason Arnott tied the score at 1-1, Pittsburgh struck
suddenly with less than three minutes left in the period ended with
goals by Aleksei Kovalev and Jan Hrdina.
</P>
<P>
   Hrdina's goal with 17 seconds left in the period silenced the
crowd, the first home sellout of the series for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr had quieted the crowd long before that, in the ninth minute
of the game, when he went round the Devils' defense on the left.
But he lost control of the puck as he cut into the middle, and the
crowd roared seconds later when Jagr was crushed against the boards
by Ken Daneyko, the defenseman who has played in all 107 of New
Jersey's playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   More silence filled the arena three minutes into the second
period when Titov opened the scoring with his first goal in the
series, beating Martin Brodeur up close to the goaltender's left.
The play developed when Jagr outmuscled Scott Stevens for a loose
puck, allowing Straka to pick it up and feed Titov.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils brought life to the crowd 6:22 into the period, when
Arnott scored his second goal of the series from almost directly in
front after a pass by Patrik Elias, who went around the net from
right to left. Arnott found himself on his back, mobbed by his
teammates immediately after the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Down by two goals, Dave Andreychuk revived the Devils with a
goal 7:24 into the third period to make the score 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Pittsburgh's Martin Straka capped a gutsy series comeback by
scoring with five and a half minutes to play to put the game beyond
New Jersey, which beat Pittsburgh four times in five games in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing to go out of the playoffs so early as
the No. 1 seed,'' said Petr Sykora, who had three goals in the
series for the Devils, but failed to take a shot in Tuesday night's
game. ``I'm personally disappointed because the three goals I got
were not enough.''

VERO BEACH SET TO MAKE ITS PITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Florida officials believe the state will grant them
$7.5 million in funding, so they've started mapping out their
proposal to keep the Dodgers in Dodgertown.
</P>
<P>
   Until this point, officials from Vero Beach and Indian River
County have focused their attention on raising $20 million in funds
to purchase Dodgertown and keep the Dodgers in the Florida
shoreline community.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dodgertown managing director Craig Callan said he met
with officials from Vero Beach, Fla., and Indian River County late
last week. They will meet again next week to continue formulating
their proposal, the next step in negotiating to keep the Dodgers,
who've trained for 51 straight springs at Dodgertown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started going over broad-stroke concepts with the city and
the county,'' Callan said. ``We're giving ideas to the city and
county. We were waiting for the funding from the state. Without the
funding from the state, Vero Beach could not happen. Once we get
the extra dollars... it ups the ante.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are also thinking about moving their spring site to
the Fort McDowell Indian Reservation near Scottsdale, Ariz. The
Fort McDowell Indian Community is trying to build a $30 million
complex for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million Vero Beach is seeking would be used to purchase
Dodgertown and renovate it; the Florida communities would use $10.5
in bonds and $2 million from a tourism tax. The final hurdle is
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush signing the $7.5 bill, which would be split
over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Callan, an employee of the Dodgers who lives in Vero Beach,
doesn't think that will be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Callan, Dodgers senior vice president Tommy Lasorda, Dodgers
secretary and general counsel Sam Fernandez, Vero Beach city
manager Rex Taylor and Indian River County administrator Jim
Chandler visited the state capital in Tallahassee last week after
the bill moved through the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have the money and are confident we're going to get
the $7.5 million,'' Callan said. ``Our comfort level was high
because it passed so easy through the Senate and the House.
(Governor Bush) has been very supportive. We left (the meeting) and
were all feeling good about the state dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers want Dodgertown renovated. They want a new
weight-training facility, new clubhouses and the renovation and
expansion of 6,500-seat Holman Stadium to 10,000 or 12,000 seats.
They also want the city and county to purchase the neighboring
9-hole golf course for future expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vero Beach is in an enviable position to come up with the
money and build a facility, or renovate a facility, the Dodgers
would be happy with,'' Callan said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's hitting: An alteration in Todd Hundley's batting
stance, from the left side, is the reason behind the recent surge
in his batting average, which rose from .148 to .217.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't move my front foot at all and it keeps my head
still,'' Hundley said. ``In Philly, just during batting practice,
the wind was gusting like a son of a gun. I hit one in the upper
deck and said, `You gotta be kidding me.' If you don't figure it
out from there, you're an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last four games, Hundley is 7 for 16 (.438) with two
homers, two doubles and seven RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: With second baseman Eric Young out with a strained
right calf, shortstop Mark Grudzielanek batted leadoff. In 1996
with Montreal, Grudzielanek hit .306 and was an All-Star. He went 0
for 4 on Tuesday.... Right-hander Antonio Osuna pitched 12/3
innings of scoreless relief in his first appearance since being
activated from the disabled list.

WILLIAM WOODWARD III, 54, EX-REPORTER AND CANDIDATE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Woodward III, whose society family was known
as much for its violent deaths as for its wealth, died Sunday on
the Upper East Side of Manhattan after a 14-story plunge from his
apartment. He was 54.
</P>
<P>
   A police official said that Woodward had been under psychiatric
care and no foul play was suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, who was briefly a newspaper reporter and twice ran
unsuccessfully for elective office, came from a family haunted by
well-publicized deaths.
</P>
<P>
   His mother killed his father, William Woodward Jr., then later
killed herself shortly before the publication of a book by Truman
Capote that gave a fictionalized account of the father's death.
Woodward's brother killed himself by jumping from a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   His father's death came in 1955, when he was shot dead, at 35,
in a bedroom doorway on his estate in Oyster Bay, on Long Island.
His wife, Ann, said she had mistaken him for a prowler. A grand
jury found that no crime had been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward twice ran for office. In 1981, he spent more than
$100,000 of his own money during a Democratic primary campaign for
an at-large City Council seat from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter what he hoped to bring to the Council,
Woodward pulled out a piece of paper on which he had written:
``Boldness, innovativeness, cost-consciousness and independence.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1981 primary was canceled when the U.S. Justice Department
refused to allow the vote. It was uncertain when the Justice
Department would approve new election districts for the city.
</P>
<P>
   After the cancellation of the election, the stolid Woodward
said, ``I must say, the only thing that cheers me about this is not
having to stand at another subway stop.''
</P>
<P>
   He had tried in 1978 for a state Senate seat. He aided a more
successful candidate, Hugh L. Carey, and after Carey became
governor, he appointed Woodward deputy banks superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 to 1971, Woodward was a reporter at The New York Post.
He was a founder and the publisher of More, a journalism review.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Le Rosey, a preparatory school in Switzerland, and
Harvard College, where he was editor of The Crimson. He was also a
graduate of the Harvard School of Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's survivors include his wife, Lisa, and a daughter,
Elizabeth.

DEADBEAT DAD IMAGE A MYTH, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 12-year-old Addison Ong's team won a Boys Club state
championship basketball game last month at America West Arena, his
father was there rooting for him _ along with his father's new
wife, his mother, his mother's boyfriend, his brother, two sets of
grandparents and an aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Addison had the biggest cheering section there, with our
blended family,'' says Kendall Ong, the proud father. ``In a
divorced family, you have a separation, but you don't want it to
become a rift. That's not good for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall and Rosann Ong share custody of Addison and Dylan, 8.
Kendall has the boys every other weekend and one weeknight, but he
also sees them at basketball practices and school activities. He
makes child-support payments and supplements them by buying
clothes, bikes and toys. ``Whoever is with the kids takes care of
their needs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall is the polar opposite of those buzzwords applied to
divorced fathers in the '90s: Deadbeat Dads. Runaway Dads. Absentee
Dads.
</P>
<P>
   According to a landmark study recently published by Arizona
State University psychology professor Sanford Braver, Kendall is
the rule rather than the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every aspect of what I call the `bad divorced dad'
image has turned out to be a myth, an inaccurate and damaging
stereotype. Not only is this myth seriously inaccurate, it has led
to harmful and dangerous social policies,'' Braver writes in his
new book, ``Divorced Dads: Shattering the Myths'' (Tarcher/Putnam,
$25).
</P>
<P>
   Braver's research, supported by $10 million in federal grants
over the past 15 years, has produced one of the nation's most
comprehensive studies on non-custodial parents. The book is based
on interviews with 400 Maricopa County families that were tracked
from 1986 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Braver takes aim at what he contends are the erroneous
conclusions of previous, flawed studies that generated the myths
about divorced fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them is the oft-quoted report of sociologist
Lenore Weitzman, author of the 1985 book, ``The Divorce
Revolution.'' Weitzman, then a Harvard University professor,
asserted that women and children suffer on average a 73 percent
drop in their standard of living after a divorce, while fathers
experience a 42 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Braver calls the Weitzman data ``probably the most widely known
and influential social-science results of the last 20 years.''
Trouble is, they're wrong, according to leading social scientists
who were unable to replicate Weitzman's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Braver believes an error in arithmetic lies behind the purported
73 percent drop in women's standard of living. The actual
calculation should have been a decrease of 27 percent, he says. But
even that overstates the case, according to Braver's research that
found women and men fare roughly the same financially after
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Braver confronted Weitzman about the math error in a 1989
telephone conversation. In his book, Braver quotes her as saying,
``I'm not sure I can rule out what you said. I'll investigate it
and get back to you.'' She didn't call him back.
</P>
<P>
   Years later _ in 1996 _ Weitzman acknowledged in a journal
article that her original figures were faulty but stuck to her
premise that divorce has unequal economic consequences for men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   Now a professor at George Mason University in Virginia, Weitzman
is on sabbatical in England. Her secretary relayed ``The
Republi''c's request for comment to Weitzman via e-mail. Weitzman
replied that she was traveling and unable to give interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix attorney Jeff Zimmerman, a fathers' rights activist,
hopes the debunking of Weitzman's study will lead to changes in
divorce law regarding child support and custody issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you assume that most fathers are deadbeats and won't pay,
and most women are financially devastated by divorce, you come up
with a system that is punitive, very one-sided,'' says Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Greene, acting president of the Children's Rights Council
of Arizona, says the focus of his group is to change ``an obsolete,
antiquated'' system. Braver's book ``gives us ammunition that
wasn't there before,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies on divorced families relied on skewed samples _
often based solely on reports from the mother, or lumping divorced
fathers together with never-married fathers, Braver says.
</P>
<P>
   Braver is the first to interview mothers, fathers and their
children several times for three years after the divorce was final.
He then compared their responses to available court records. Not
surprisingly, divorced moms and dads almost always gave conflicting
answers to the same questions.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced moms reported receiving between two-thirds and
three-quarters of the child support owed, and divorced dads said
they paid more than 90 percent of what was owed. The average amount
paid annually was $2,718 according to the mothers, and $3,555
according to the fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth lies somewhere in between,'' Braver notes.
</P>
<P>
   Though Braver began his investigation with the prevailing
mind-set about divorced dads, he said it wasn't long before he
realized men had become victims of reverse sexism that emerged in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've essentially given the message that fathers don't matter,
fathers are dispensable, fathers are superfluous, like an
appendix,'' Braver says. ``Somewhere along the line, fathers lost
their cache.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50 percent divorce rate in a society that devalues dads has
come home to roost in a big way. A 1940s Gallup survey reported the
biggest behavior problems in children included cutting in line,
chewing gum in class and not raising their hand to ask questions.
Now the lineup includes school violence, teen pregnancy, gangs and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it oversimplifies the picture to say this is all due
to the fact that we threw fathers out of the family. But clearly,
there's a large part of pathology that can be pinned empirically on
father absence,'' says Braver.
</P>
<P>
   Most divorced dads have more contact with their kids than was
previously believed, he says. A 1983 study based at the University
of Pennsylvania reported that only 49 percent of fathers had
contact with their children within the preceding year. But Braver
found that 90 percent had contact _ by either parent's account.
Five out of six fathers living in the same town three years after
the divorce reported weekly contact.
</P>
<P>
   When contact was limited, the cause wasn't necessarily the
father's fault. Visitation orders sometimes restricted contact, and
mothers sometimes denied fathers access to their children, Braver
says.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant myth about divorce punctured by Braver's
study _ and corroborated by other researchers _ is that fathers
abandon their wives and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the dirty little secret of divorce research. It's not
the men who are leaving. In two out of three cases, the mom wants
the marriage to end and initiates the divorce,'' says Braver.
</P>
<P>
   While infidelity and substance abuse grab headlines as reasons
for marital splits, the most common factors cited by both parties
are losing a sense of closeness and not having emotional needs met.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a quite recent trend precipitated by the cultural
changes brought about primarily by the women's movement; this
cultural trend best accounts for the unprecedented rise in the
divorce rate,'' writes Braver. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE GARDEN MISSES OUT ON A GEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Life is more often competitive than it is convenient.
So while Natalie Williams is going home to Utah, Chamique Holdsclaw
is bound for what was the worst team in the surviving women's pro
basketball league.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw was picked first in the Women's National Basketball
Association draft on Tuesday by the Washington Mystics, the only
college player taken in the first round. The selections were
announced and Holdsclaw was introduced at the Sheraton Hotel at 53d
Street and Seventh Avenue, a subway ride from the Astoria Houses in
Queens, where she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw had too big a name and too little leverage to get her
first choice, which was home sweet home. She stayed a year too long
in college, at Tennessee, trying unsuccessfully to win a fourth
national title. The rival American Basketball League folded before
she could say, ``Give me Liberty, or the Columbus Quest.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a tribute to Holdsclaw's presence and popularity that she
was picked before so many talented and experience pros, such as
Williams, who went third to the Utah Starrz.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the WNBA did the credible thing, by not rigging
its draft, by hook, crook, lottery or trade. You always got the
feeling, reading between the quotes, that Madison Square Garden's
team wanted to believe that something would be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Washington's pick to make, not ours, and we owed that
to our teams and fans,'' Val Ackerman, the WNBA president, said.
</P>
<P>
   It was her boldest statement yet that David Stern's women's
annex has a mandate, beyond marketing, to do right by the sport.
Anyway, 14 years ago, there were suspicions that it was arranged
for the New York Knicks to land Patrick Ewing, who has spent much
of his career front and center in a storm of contention about
everything the Knicks are not.
</P>
<P>
   June Holdsclaw came to the draft, and proclaimed her
granddaughter better off three hours away by Amtrak from New York's
inherent expectations, distractions and pressure. If the woman who
raised her from the time she was 11 believes this, fine. Chamique,
total talent and team player, wasn't about to publicly contradict
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just praying I wouldn't go to Utah,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No offense intended, or taken, by Williams, who is from
Taylorsville, Utah, about 15 miles outside Salt Lake City. As a
29-year-old refugee of the more competitive ABL, and its last most
valuable player, not only is Williams more likely to have a greater
immediate impact, she will play in front of the more than 100
members of her extended family, plus Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand he has a season ticket,'' said the 6-foot-2-inch
Williams, a fan of Stockton-to-Malone since high school.
</P>
<P>
   When her agent called Monday night to say that Utah was likely
to take her, she held off calling her mother, Robyn Gray, in Salt
Lake City. She wanted to be sure, as certain as Holdsclaw became
these last few days that she was not going to play in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw could have called that shot, and extracted a few extra
dollars (she is likely to earn about $250,000 a year under a
personal services contract) had she left school last year. She
could have pocketed an extra year's earnings, been back at
Tennessee by last fall, on track for the political science degree
she will get May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Smith once told a reluctant Michael Jordan to leave school
early for his own good. Sometimes the coach has to be the educator
in less conventional ways. Pat Summitt, at least publicly, never
campaigned for the obvious, for the fact that Chamique could have
had it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   The degree came first for June Holdsclaw, a stickler for
education who said she is looking forward to graduation more than
any game her granddaughter will play. Two of her adult children
completed college, and a third, Chamique's mother, Benita,
currently attends the College of Staten Island. She hopes Chamique
will pursue her master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   The loser here is the Garden, once again victimized, you might
say on a day the Miami Heat was visiting, by the single-minded
agenda of another coaching Pat from down south. As for Chamique,
she left New York four years ago and became the biggest basketball
name in the state of Tennessee. She and her jump shot will do fine
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   First things first. Graduation in Knoxville. Then the wedding of
Kellie Jolly, the Tennessee point guard, Holdsclaw's four-year
teammate and the fourth-round draft choice yesterday of the
Cleveland Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bridesmaid,'' said Holdsclaw, darling of the draft,
whose long-rumored marriage to the Liberty could not be arranged.

SPARKS MAKE MILTON THEIR NO. 1 PICK

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Sparks are feeling pretty good
about themselves after snagging what they feel is the best draft
class of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks chose 6-foot-1 forward DeLisha Milton as their No. 1
draft pick and were surprised to see 6-5 center Clarisse
Machanguana still available for their second selection in the
four-round WNBA draft Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ukari Figgs, who led Purdue to its first NCAA championship
last month, was their third choice, and they picked 6-3 forward
La'Keisha Frett in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say, we were very surprised that Machanguana was there
in the second round,'' Sparks general manager Rhonda Windham said.
``I'm very happy with the players we selected. We needed to get
bigger and I think we definitely secured our front line with the
players we selected.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton, Machaungua and Frett were among 35 players drafted from
the defunct American Basketball League. Figgs was one of only 12
college players drafted. The other three were from overseas. The
expansion teams, the Orlando Magic and Minnesota Lynx, had five
picks to bring the number of players drafted to 50.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Mystics nabbed three-time NCAA Player of the Year
Chamique Holdsclaw, the forward-guard from Tennessee, with their
No. 1 overall draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Former Long Beach StingRays forward Yolanda Griffith was the
second pick who went to the Sacramento Monarchs where she will be
reunited with former StingRays coach Maura McHugh, now an assistant
coach with the Monarchs. Natalie Williams, who played 21/2 seasons
with Portland Power and almost played with the StingRays before the
team folded last August, was the third overall pick by the Utah
Starzz.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the Sparks feel they have a big and talented lineup to
compete in the league's third season.
</P>
<P>
   Milton averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with the Portland
Power. She played with Sparks center-forward Lisa Leslie on the
U.S. national team last year and is seeking a spot on the team for
the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Milton said what she brings to the Sparks ``is my ability to run
the floor, play outstanding defense, rebound, and put the ball in
the basket if I need to''
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, ``I will compliment Lisa Leslie in games.
She's an outstanding player and I feel that with the attributes
that I have I can only make her stand out that much more and make
life a little bit easier for her in the paint.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what head coach Orlando Woolridge had envisioned
in choosing Milton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frees (Lisa) up as a perimeter player as well as a post
player,'' Woolridge said. ``Now we can go with big lineups. It
gives us more versatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly with Machaungua on the roster. The native from
Mozambique and graduate of Old Dominion averaged 10.2 points and
4.8 rebounds with the San Jose Lasers.
</P>
<P>
   Windham said Figgs, who averaged 11.6 points and 4.2 assist for
the Boilermakers last season, was the best available point guard in
the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figgs can play in big games and she has proven that she can
overcome adversities,'' Windham said. ``She's a very good, young
talent and she's what we wanted in a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Frett averaged 9.0 points and 4.3 rebounds with the Philadelphia
Rage.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA NOTES: Training camp opens May 14. The 14-player roster
must be trimmed to the maximum 11 by June 9. The Sparks open their
season at home against Sacramento. They will play the Detroit Shock
in a preseason game June 10 at the Arrowhead Pond. ... Other former
StingRay players to be drafted were forward Clarissa-Davis
Wrightsil (Phoenix) in the second round and guard Andrea Nagy
(Washington) in the third round.

A PLAN TO EASE PAIN OF DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Author Sanford Braver recommends two ways to make divorce easier
on families.
</P>
<P>
   The first is making joint legal custody a presumption under the
law rather than a point to be negotiated. Judges would retain the
option of awarding sole custody in appropriate circumstances, such
as cases of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``With sole legal custody, one parent becomes a visitor. Joint
legal custody is a way of telling both parents, the child and
society that this child still has two parents,'' Braver said.
</P>
<P>
   Joint custody allows both parents to share important decisions
about the child, such as medical care and education. It is not the
same as residential custody, which specifies where the child lives
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that joint custody is good for families in the
following respects: It makes for better adjusted children and it
makes for better child-support payments. We spend $4 billion a year
in this country on child-support enforcement. This solution is free
and it works,'' Braver said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Braver said divorce court should be demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter has diabetes. When she was diagnosed, they sent
out a public-health nurse to explain the disease to her and tell
her what her life was going to be like. Why don't we send somebody
out to talk to people who file for divorce? Why not have a
social-service person make the initial contact instead of making
the first stop a lawyer's office?'' Braver said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Armstrong, presiding judge of Family Court in Maricopa
County Superior Court, said the courts already are taking steps to
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation services are available to divorcing couples, as is an
early intervention program that promotes early settlement,
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature passed a law three years ago requiring divorcing
parents to attend education classes about the effects of divorce on
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really aimed at reducing parental conflict,'' Armstrong
said. ``We know now that persistent conflict is the foremost
indicator of divorce outcomes. If there is conflict, that puts
children at higher risk for delinquency, self-destructive behavior,
depression and reduced academic performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Braver credits the education classes with the upswing in
joint-custody orders. Only one-third of the Maricopa County divorce
cases resulted in joint-custody agreements when he conducted his
study. Now, two-thirds of divorcing parents opt for joint custody.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong favors joint custody, echoing Braver's opinion that it
makes for better relationships and compliance with child-support
orders. But the judge opposes Braver's proposal to make joint
custody a legal presumption, because he thinks each case should be
evaluated independently.
</P>
<P>
   A bill that would have instituted legal presumption stalled in
the House Human Services Committee this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Anderson, R-Mesa and committee chairman, said most
members didn't think it was necessary to change the law because the
majority of cases were resolved by joint custody anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of those ideas that takes a couple of years
for people to get comfortable with,'' Anderson said. ``The state of
Washington has this kind of legislation in place. It is
ground-breaking. Arizona would become the second state if we passed
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Braver both serve on the Legislature's Domestic
Relations Reform Committee, which will explore some of the ideas in
Braver's study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his conclusions are very accurate. He has done one of
the most comprehensive studies in the country. We need to realize
that children are best off with both parents in their lives,''
Anderson said. &QL;
