<HEADLINE> Egypt PM Takes Stock of Asian Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri said today that the objective of his Asian tour was
to encourage Asian investors to contribute to Egypt's development
process.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, who returned home on Tuesday evening from a ten-day
visit to Malaysia, Singapore and China, today gave a detailed
report to President Hosni Mubarak on his appraisal of the outcome
of the tour.
</P>
<P>
"My visit is aimed at boosting relations with the three
countries, discussing issues of common interest and reviewing the
latest developments of the Mideast peace process," Ganzouri told
reporters after the meeting with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He termed as "fruitful" his tour to the three countries, the
first of its kind by an Egyptian prime minister in 33 years.
</P>
<P>
"I felt the three countries' support for Egypt and its leaders
in serving regional and international causes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Taking stock of Egypt's investment environment, however, he
said that offering tax and customs exemptions is not enough to
lure investors to the country.
</P>
<P>
"What is more important is to solve any problem facing the
investors inside Egypt," he added, voicing the hope that his tour
would be a prelude to other tours of Arab and European countries.
</P>
<P>
He signed a number of agreements with the three governments
while the 25 Egyptian businessmen accompanying him on the visit
also concluded several deals in the fields of exportation and
establishing joint ventures, said the premier.
</P>
<P>
Memorandums of understanding were also concluded to set up
giant projects between Egypt and Singapore, Malaysia and China.
</P>
<P>
"I discussed with Asian officials the possibility of launching
new projects in Egypt, especially establishing free trade zones,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Singapore have agreed in principle to establish the
"Shark-Al-Tafria" free trade zone on a 50-square-kilometer
area, while a Singaporean delegation will visit Egypt in mid-May
for more follow-up talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, a Chinese delegation is due
here in mid-June to probe potentials for launching a
Sino-Egyptian free economic zone north of the Gulf of Suez.
</P>
<P>
He said that an agreement was reached with Malaysia on setting
up an agricultural and industrial zone in east al-Oweinat.
</P>
<P>
Since coming to power in January 1996, the government of
Ganzouri has made boosting investment its top priority and vowed
to remove all obstacles to that goal.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Iraq today discussed how
to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fields of petroleum and
energy, particularly transport of Iraqi crude oil into Jordan
through pipelines.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here, the Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral
Resources Mohammed Saleh Hourani and his Iraqi counterpart Amir
Mohammed Rashid also discussed petroleum and gas prospect and
exploitation in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the Jordanian minister described the
meeting as fruitful. He pointed out that the supply of Iraqi crude
oil and by-products to Jordan is proceeding in a satisfactory
manner as planned.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food accord between Iraq and the U.N., Iraq
is permitted to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil to buy back
food and other necessities for its 19 million citizens suffering
from the U.N.-sanctions after the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which sided with Iraq during the Gulf crisis, has been
striving to hold a bigger share in the program.

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan to Solve Trade Disputes Through Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC),
the executive body of the European Union (EU), and Japan have
agreed not to resort to the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute
settlement mechanism unless solutions to their trade disputes
cannot be found through bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached the agreement at their annual high level
consultations held in Brussels, where they reviewed bilateral
trade and investment, examined progress towards deregulation in
Japan, and analyzed the current state and prospects for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Japan has agreed to a fresh round of consultations on fish
products and hoped to work together with the EC to advance Japan's
accession to an agreement on automobile trade.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of objective analysis of trade flows was also
agreed, with the commission suggesting a joint study into the
causes leading to low European investment in Japan.
</P>
<P>
EC also welcomed the dialogue over deregulation in Japan, but
said that progress in this field so far had been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was co-chaired by Hans-Friederich Beseler, the EC's
director-general for external economic relations, and Ogura Kazuo,
vice-minister for foreign affairs of Japan.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Mobilizes People Against Islamists as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian government has
appealed to the people to mobilize themselves and stay double
vigilant against Islamic extremists, after 93 villagers were
slaughtered Monday night in a remote village 25 kilometers from
the capital Algiers.
</P>
<P>
In a speech Tuesday night on television, Algerian Prime
Minister Ahmed Ouyahia condemned the massacre of the villagers,
half of the victims being women, young girls and children, by what
he called "terrorist dregs who are engaged in a suicidal headlong
rush."
</P>
<P>
He called on the people to show double vigilance and mobilize
themselves against the terrorists, who he said were trying to
sabotage the country's coming legislative elections scheduled for
June 5.
</P>
<P>
"Each time Algeria moves ahead in its process of going out of
the crisis, it meets with a resurgence of terrorist acts, such as
those produced on the eve of the presidential elections (in 1995)
and the referendum on the revision of the constitution (this
year)," said Ouyahia.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian army are distributing leaflets at all the highway
exists of big cities to car drivers, urging those young people who
have supported Islamic extremist groups to abandon "the road of
violence."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all the Algerian political parties, except the
outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), have registered to join
the legislative elections on June 5, which will produce a new
two-chamber parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian television also showed pictures of some survivors
of the massacre who escaped to the capital Algiers after
witnessing their closest slaughtered in the most atrocious ways by
Islamists.
</P>
<P>
One 14-year-old girl witnessed the terrorists slaughtering her
whole family, while a woman, whose throat was half cut, survived
by pretending to be dead.
</P>
<P>
They said that the terrorists numbered 150 to 200, fully armed,
having beard hanging to their breasts, and some of them showing
the word "emir" in their hair cut.
</P>
<P>
The Islamists placed land mines and explosive engines on the
outskirt of the Haouch-Boukhelef-Khemisti farmstead on the plain
of Mitidja to prevent security forces from rescuing the villagers,
said the survivors.
</P>
<P>
The villagers were killed by knife and agricultural tools, and
some of them were burnt to death, said witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that this is the first time for the Algerian
government to fully publicize a massacre in the village,
apparently because of the seriousness of the latest massacre,
which is the biggest made known since the country was plunged into
violence five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French government today expressed its solidarity
with the Algerian people and condemned the massacre as "an
atrocity beyond imagination."
</P>
<P>
"France is worried and shocked by the blind and savage
character of the violence which is striking Algeria," said French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 to 80,000 people are estimated to have been killed
by violence in Algeria over the past five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- For the next five months, China
will play rainmaker over the upper reaches of the Yellow River to
alleviate the effects of severe drought in the valley.
</P>
<P>
The 5,464-km Yellow River, the second-longest river in China,
rises in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and has been suffering from
drought since 1990, with less water flowing in the upper reaches
and no flow at all in part of the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, the water level in the upper
reaches has dropped to its lowest point in history.
</P>
<P>
An area of 30,000 sq km, located among Qinghai, Gansu, and
Sichuan provinces, was chosen as the site for an artificial rain
project, to be carried out by airplanes dropping chemicals into
the clouds to produce precipitation.
</P>
<P>
The one million yuan (about 120,000 US dollars) project will be
carried over the next five months to increase the river's water
volume by 480 million cubic meters, which is 2.2 percent of the
river's annual water flow in Qinghai Province.

<HEADLINE> Dini Says EC Forecast "Balanced," "Correct" on Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said today that the European Commission (EC)'s recent
forecast on Italy's ability to join a single currency Europe is
"correct" and "balanced."
</P>
<P>
Dini made the comment to the press in the German capital of
Bonn while accompanying Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on
a four-day state visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
He said the assessments made by the EC, the executive body of
the European Union (EU), on how various countries would meet the
criteria for entrance into the European Monetary Union (EMU) were
"correct."
</P>
<P>
The EMU, set forth by the Maastricht Treaty agreed on by EU
member nations, would launch a single European currency, called
the Euro, on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The "balanced" EC report "fully recognizes all that we are
doing and what we have done," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report's predication that Italy's ratio of
budget deficit against gross domestic product (GDP) would be worse
in 1998 than in 1997, Dini said some of the current budget
measures do not go beyond this year and the 1998 budget would turn
them into more lasting provisions so as to control the deficit/GDP
ratio under the targeted three percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the Italian government is already working on a welfare
reform, so as to reach the goals set by the Maastricht Treaty.

LUOYANG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The First Mayors' Forum on
Well-Known Chinese Historical and Cultural Cities closed today in
the city of Luoyang, Henan Province, with a call for greater
efforts to protect the country's old towns.
</P>
<P>
The mayors urged all citizens to be aware of the obligation to
safeguard historical cities, and said general planning of these
cities should be well-organized and conducted in accordance with
the law.
</P>
<P>
They also asked that special funds be set up to help, and said
that both the government as well as people at home and from abroad
are asked to contribute financially.

China's development should not be done at the cost of
destroying the country's historical and cultural traditions, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which was held over the last three days, was
sponsored by four units including the overseas edition of the
People's Daily and the Luoyang city government. Participants
included mayors from over 20 Chinese cities.
</P>

<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chief of staff of the French armed
forces General Jean-Philippe Douin has rejected the American
concept of "zero death" in modern military operations, which
emphasizes the role of high technology in military equipment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the latest issue of the Defense Ministry
publication "Lettre de la Defense," Douin described as "illusion
of military saloon" the concept of "zero death," which claims that
technological superiority in armaments and communications can
bring victory over the enemy with a minimum number of soldiers
deployed.
</P>
<P>
"Technology will never replace engagement in the field, which
always carries risk but is the only way that allows one to obtain
the outcome sought," said the top soldier of the French army.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the French army will always let its soldiers
go into the field under good conditions, which he said is "a very
clear will" of President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
"Our men should be able to defend themselves if the situation
calls for it, by imposing themselves with force and properly
adapted means upon the (other) sides in presence," he said.
</P>
<P>
France now has 15,000 soldiers deployed overseas, most of them
in Africa but also in former Yugoslavia and Albania.

TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament today issued a
statement condemning a German court's rule on the Mykonos case as
"a flagrant violation of human rights."
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the statement
was endorsed by 160 members of the Iranian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court verdict on April 10 on the Mykonos case, which
implicated top Iranian leaders' order to kill four Kurdish
opposition leaders in a Berlin restaurant five years ago, sparked
a crisis in relations between Iran and Germany and other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the MPs strongly criticized the German
Parliament's action to support "the political and illegal verdict"
of the Berlin court and called it a hasty decision.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "German support to the terrorist groups
is a flagrant violation of human rights."
</P>
<P>
It also called on the government to review Iran's future ties
with Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Iran had recalled their ambassadors and expelled
four diplomats from each side. Ambassadors from European Union
member nations, except Greece, were also recalled from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the diplomatic battle between Bonn and Tehran has
calmed down and the two sides have expressed their hope that
neither of them would like to sever the bilateral relations.

It found that earnings inequality fell by 5.5 percent from 1987

<HEADLINE> French Court Gives Jail Sentences to Skinheads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A court in the French city
Marseille today gave jail sentences ranging from two years to 18
months to four neo-Nazi skinhead youths for desecrating a Jewish
cemetery seven years ago, closing a much publicized case of
skinheads in France.
</P>
<P>
The 5th Chamber of the Tribunal of Grand Instance of Marseille
sentenced Olivier Fimbry, 29, and Patrice Laonegro, 31, to two
years in prison, while Yannick Garnier, 27, and Bertrand Nouveau,
29, were given 18 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
The four skinheads appeared on court from May 17 to 20 on
charges of "violation of tombs and destruction of mobile objects
or immobile properties belonging to others."
</P>
<P>
Jean-Claude Gos, a fifth skinhead who also led the desecrating
act in the 19th century Jewish cemetery in Carpentras, southern
France, died of a motor accident in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The skinheads destroyed 34 tombs and dug up the body of Felix
Germon, a Jew buried in the cemetery several decades ago, on the
night of May 8, 1990.
</P>
<P>
The barbarous act triggered a strong protest from the Jewish
community in France and drew great public attention.
</P>
<P>
Police, judging from the letters and diaries seized from the
skinheads, found they were systematically motivated by Nazi
ideology.

<HEADLINE> UN Welcomes Cypriot Adjustment Plan of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations welcomed
today the decision by Cypriot government to adjust the plan
of its joint military exercises with Greece during the ongoing
U.N.-led proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots
on the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting here with President
Glafcos Clerides, U.N. Resident Representative Gustave Feissel
said that "I think it's a good step, it shows that there is an
effort being made to create the best possible climate to
facilitate what we are in the process of doing."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government announced Tuesday that Greek warplanes
will suspend flying over Cyprus during the forthcoming joint
military exercises as a good-will gesture for the sake of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed a joint defense pact in November
1993, which provides for joint military exercises between the the
two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has called for good-will gestures by the Greek and
Turkish sides during the ongoing proximity talks, which started
on March 10, in a bid to facilitate the climate for the
face-to-face talks by leaders of the two communities by the
middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Feissel also appealed to the Turkish Cypriot side to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government's unilateral decision to hold flights by
Greek fighters, was also welcomed by Britain, China, France and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 and the problem has remained
unsolved despite the international community's peace efforts for
the past 23 years.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany to Start Initiative to Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany have decided to
"seize their European partners" to start an initiative by the
European Union to help save thousands of refugees stranded in the
rebel-controlled areas of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We are shocked by the treatment inflicted upon the people in
distress in eastern Zaire. We are profoundly worried about the
reports of massacres," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Zaire quoted Zairian villagers as saying that
hundreds of Rwandan Hutu refugees have been massacred by the rebel
troops of Laurent-Desire Kabila in a refugee camp south of
Kisangani, Zaire's third largest city taken by the rebels one
month ago.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has also accused
Zairian rebels of "killing by starvation" the Hutu refugees and
displaced Zairian civilians in the eastern part controlled by the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
France today called on Kabila to honor his commitment to allow
international humanitarian aid workers to reach the refugees, and
to help repatriate the refugees back to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"With Germany, we have seized our European partners to make
proposals of action by the European Union in this direction," said
Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
France Tuesday appealed for the establishment of a transitional
government in Zaire, and has repeatedly called for a direct
meeting between Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko and Kabila.

<HEADLINE> UEFA May Discuss Change of Champions League Format </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's governing body
UEFA may discuss a proposal made by Juventus to change the format
of champions league in the future.
</P>
<P>
Juventus, the reigning European Cup champion and finalist again
this year, has proposed that future Champions Cup semifinals and
finals be played within one week in the same country.
</P>
<P>
This year's seven other quarterfinal teams have backed the
idea, which would help reduce the congestion of domestic and
European matches.
</P>
<P>
UEFA has indicated it will consider doing away with the
two-legged semifinals and having a four-team showdown in one
venue. It could allow UEFA to switch from six groups of four
teams to four groups of six clubs.
</P>
<P>
"All the other quarterfinalists reacted very positively to
(Juventus managing director Roberto) Bettega's plan," UEFA
spokesman Fritz Ahlstrom said. "And so did UEFA. That means we
will discuss it but it would not be possible before the 1998-99
season."

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Five-Nation Accord A Fresh Model for Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A brand-new model for safeguarding
regional security has emerged in an agreement signed here today on
reduction of military forces along border areas between China and
neighboring Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The first of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region, the accord
not only serves the interest of the five signatories but also
represents a fresh move toward handling inter-state issues through
peaceful and trustful means.
</P>
<P>
Talks on the accord, significant both politically and
militarily, lasted more than seven years. During the period, all
parties showed their confidence in each other. Mutual
understanding and cooperation helped find an eventual solution to
the complicated and sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
Such a process and outcome fully manifest a wise sense of
security differing from the Cold War mentality. As China has kept
promoting in recent years the establishment of a new world order,
peaceful ways, instead of use of force, should always be sought to
settle inter-state disputes and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The process of world multipolarization has been accelerating
since the end of the Cold War. The dominant theme of the current
world is striving for an international environment of peace and
stability conducive to development and prosperity for all.
</P>
<P>
However, the world is far from being peaceful. Hegemonism and
power politics are still pursued by some forces. It is not rare to
see them handling relations with others, either bilateral or
multilateral, in an unfair way, causing instability and tension
among nations.
</P>
<P>
China has always maintained that the establishment of a fair
and rational new world order should be based on the principles of
equality and mutual benefit, mutual respect for each others'
sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression,
non-interference in each others' internal affairs and peaceful
co-existence. These principles have become a consensus of the
majority in the world.
</P>
<P>
This unprecedented accord reflects the five nations'
determination to strengthen cooperation and ensure a peaceful
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
By undertaking the obligations provided in the accord, the five
nations have presented to the world a bright prospect of the
region featuring peace and stability in the run to the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> South African Pregnant Women Infected with HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- It was estimated by the end of
1996 there were 14.07 percent of South African women attending public
health services' antenatal clinics were infected with HIV, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was based on a sample of 15,044 specimens screened during the
seventh national annual survey in a series of unlinked anonymous
surveys between October and November 1996, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
About 2.4 million, accounting for six percent of all South
Africans, are now HIV positive compared to 1.8 million in 1995,
11 percent of the adult population carried the virus.
</P>
<P>
It was estimatd that 90,000 of the 2.4 million would develop
full-blown Aids during 1997 -- 20,000 of them children, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official statistics, HIV infection had increased
among women of all age groups, especially among women aged between
20 and 24.
</P>
<P>
The most alarming feature of the results was a rise in infection
in North West Province where 25 percent of pregnant women were
HIV positive compared with 8.3 perent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The results are of great concern as they indicate that despite
our efforts the HIV epidemic is still on the increase, " SAPA quoted
Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma as saying.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that South Africa had reached a very serious stage
of the epidemic, adding that medical authorities would conduct a
national review of HIV program in June to determine its strengths and
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
"Out of this fundamental review of the program should emerge a
new path in our fight against HIV-Aids," Zuma said. enditem

BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- By the end of March, China's
border defense departments and public security bureaus had seized
4,710 convicts trying to sneak across the Chinese borders.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 1,425 had attempted to go to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dianyu, director of the border defense department of the
Ministry of Public Security, said that this was merely a "trick"
played by some lawless persons to spread the rumor that the
Chinese government will enact the policy of amnesty for illegal
border crossers after it resumes the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
He said that public security departments at all levels have
been on alert against the crime of smuggling people across
borders, and prevention and interception efforts have been
strengthened along China's seashores, borders, and ports.

</P>
<P>
Philippe, ranked 50th in the world, upset world No. 4 Vladimir
Samsonov in three sets and blanked Evgueni Chtchetinine to help
Belgium roll over Belarus 3-2.
</P>
<P>
World No. 8 Michael Saive, singles runner-up in the 1993

Saive was so angry with his poor performance that he threw his bat
to the ground after the match.
</P>
<P>
Chtchetinine, rated 107th in the world, put up a solid
defensive game to beat Michael Saive 17-21, 21-15, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
Philippe Saive evened the score as he overcome one-set deficit
to beat Samsonov 13-21, 21-12, 21-19. The 20-year-old Samsonov, a
player willing to rally until his rival leaves an opening, found
Philippe's forehand topspins too strong to return.
</P>
<P>
Andras Podpinka put Belgium ahead with a 21-12, 21-10 victory
over Pavel Chomtchonak.
</P>
<P>
Michael Saive continued his poor form in the fourth game, lost
in straight sets to Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
Philippe saved face for the Saives as he snatched the deciding
set over Chtchetinine 21-17, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
"Philippe is a hero for the Belgium team," said Belgian head
coach Wang Da Yong.
</P>
<P>
"His elder brother played poorly today, but Michael always
comes into shape late," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sweden rested world No. 2 Jan-Ove Waldner and No.15 Peter
Karlsson on Thursday as Jorgen Persson led Thomas Von Scheele and
Kayode Kadiri to beat Slovakia 3-1. Von Sheele lost the opening
game in straight set to Jaromior Truksa.

his first game loss by taking the decider against Andrei Filimon
21-11, 24-22.

<HEADLINE> Various Departments Join in Fight Against Drug-Related Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Various departments and judicial
bodies have joined the Ministry of Public Security to carry out
China's targeted fight against drugs which was launched early this
month.
</P>
<P>
The National Committee of Narcotics Control (NCNC) announced
today its member departments of customs, chemical industry, public
health and others have spelled out specific measures for
intensifying the anti-drug campaign among the offices nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The General Administration of Customs (GAC) ordered all customs
agencies to focus on investigating criminal gangs involved in drug
smuggling, and improve their management over imported chemicals
that could be processed into drugs, especially natural Chinese
ephedra which is used to make "ice."
</P>
<P>
"The anti-drug campaign should move ahead shoulder to shoulder
with our anti-smuggling drive," the GAC said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Chemical Industry has launched a public
education campaign among its employees to raise their awareness of
the harmful effects of many of the materials they handle.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry will also conduct a comprehensive survey on the
situations of the production, dealing, transportation, use,
importing and exporting of chemicals that could be made into drugs.

</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation has

</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) has issued a circular
demanding procuratorial bodies across the country to issue arrest
warrants on drug charges promptly and according to law.
</P>
<P>
Those who should be indicted on drug charges must be brought to

The drug problem was effectively wiped out in China shortly
after the country was liberated by the Chinese Communist Party in
1949. Top officials attributed the victory to the widespread
participation of the public.
</P>
<P>
The country's current drug troubles arose from the opening

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Member States to Simplify Business Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
urged its member states to reduce administrative burden imposed on
newly created enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Improving and simplifying the business environment is the most
important priority, a view also shared by the European business
community," said EU Commissioner Christos Papoutsis, who is
responsible for enterprise policy.
</P>
<P>
Considering the job "a challenge for the member states," the
commissioner said the 15 EU member nations should exchange their
best practices in this field to benefit the whole community.
</P>
<P>
Papoutsis' proposal includes establishing a single contact
point for the registration of new enterprises and stimulating
businesses in their first years of development by alleviating
constraints of a tax, social, environmental and statistical nature.
</P>
<P>
Starting up a business in some EU member states can take a long
time due to the preliminary complicated procedures and a lack of
coordination between administrations.

<HEADLINE> Rules on Overseas Project Financing Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The State Planning Commission
(SPC) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)
issued "the Provisional Regulations on Administration of Project
Financing Overseas" here today.
</P>
<P>
The document is published in response to a recent State Council
decree to step up macro-control over borrowings of international
loans.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a number of local governments and departments
have raised funds on foreign capital markets by means of project
financing, to build infrastructural projects, mainly some
Sino-foreign joint venture power plants, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
Lack of experience and understanding of the matter has led to
greater difficulties, higher cost of financing, and higher prices
of equipment imported for the projects. What's worse, some
departments have even guaranteed the payback of loans, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some financing efforts have been blocked due to lack
of efficient safety measures by the Chinese side, as foreign
banking institutions are hesitant to promise loans.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems, the newly-published rule demands that
the overseas financing for domestic projects should be conducted
in a gradual and proper manner as project financing is more
complicated than corporate financing.
</P>
<P>
Project financing should only be allowed for infrastructural
projects, especially those that are foreign-funded and need
large-scale investment, have a strong capability to return the
loans, and have a long-term, stable income source.
</P>
<P>
These projects should require a total investment of 30 million
US dollars or more, and the financing of each project should be 15
million US dollars or more.
</P>
<P>
Projects without overseas investors should act slowly and
carefully when raising funds from abroad, as project financing
demands a stronger ability to repay the loans and carry out the
contract, and also the good reputation of the investors.
</P>
<P>
The regulations warn that the investors and other partners
involved in a project have different interests, and under certain
conditions these interests may conflict.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the rule says, the main investors of a project
should not be partners to carry out the contract of the project as
it may lead to serious problems.
</P>
<P>
Project financing has resulted in the increase of foreign debts
to the country, consequently, the proposals and feasibility
studies of such projects should be reported to SPC for approval,
and those of key projects should be approved by the State Council
via the SPC, according to the rule.
</P>
<P>
Financing projects should be approved or examined by the SAFE
to control the cost, ensure the cost-effects and the ability to
repay the loans, the rule says.
</P>
<P>
Localities should seriously control and guide local project
financing activities, especially the cost of financing and
construction, so as to make financing an effective way to utilize
overseas funds and ensure the state macro-control over foreign
debts, the regulations say.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Shipping Firm Expands Overseas Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- COSCO Group, the largest shipping
contractor in China, has carried out a strategy of
internationalization and made great efforts to develop its
overseas business in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Its overseas business scope has been expanded from solely
playing the role of agent for foreign contractors to operating
overseas fleets, on-shore transport, storage, ports, tourism,
trade, real estate and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by COSCO spokesman Gao Weijie at
today's news briefing to mark the group's 36th founding
anniversary. The China Ocean Shipping Company, the predecessor of
COSCO Group, was set up on April 27, 1961.
</P>
<P>
At present, Gao said, COSCO has 177 overseas firms with 5,000
employees. The group has set up a large business network covering
most of the countries in the world, with eight regional companies
as the pillars, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 and 1996, COSCO successfully issued a total of 360
million US dollars of commercial bills in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, COSCO has sent more than 60,000 laborers to work for
foreign shipping firms and other industries. In 1996 alone, the
figure was 12,900.
</P>
<P>
COSCO's fleet includes nearly 600 vessels of various types with
its container and bulk cargo handling capacities ranking among the
world's largest. In 1996, the fleet shipped a total of 112 million
tons of goods.

HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's foreign exchange

<HEADLINE> Havel Calls for Long-Term Vision in Developing Czech-German Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech
Republic, today called on politicians of both Germany and the
Czech Republic to give "long-term common interests priority" to
forge better bilateral relations for the future.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the German parliament in Bonn, Havel
said the German-Czech reconciliation accord should been seen as
"real historical opportunity" for a firm and durable coexistence
of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by the two governments in January and
approved by the parliaments in February.
</P>
<P>
Havel said the accord had created a "extremely favorable
climate" not only for the development of the bilateral ties, but
also for the cooperation between the two countries at the European
level.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Germany regretted the suffering and injustice
caused to the Czech people under Nazi occupation while Prague
expressed its regret for its expulsion of Sudeten-Germans and the
confiscation of their property after World War II.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.5 million Sudeten-Germans were expelled from territories
they had occupied for centuries in former Czechoslovakia in 1945,
accused by the Czeches of having been traitors who backed Adolf
Hitler's carve-up and occupation of their country from 1938.
</P>
<P>
Sudeten-Germans called their expulsion "one of the biggest
post-war cases of ethnic cleansing."
</P>
<P>
They also protest against the reconciliation accord in which
there was no mention of their right to resettle in the Czech
Republic and no measures for restitution or compensation of
properties seized after the deportations.
</P>
<P>
Havel said his country could not accept the return of
Sudeten-Germans.
</P>
<P>
"Just as Germany today cannot bring back to life tens of
thousands of Czech Nazi victims and turn the clock back to
1938 ... the Czech Republic cannot give back the old homes of the
expelled Germans," he said.

<HEADLINE> South African Firm to Set Up Brewery in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South African Breweries Ltd.
(SAB) had decided to establish a modern brewery in Thika town, 40
kilometers northeast of Nairobi, the Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The brewery with a annual capacity of 800,000 hectoliters
will be built at a cost of 45 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 new jobs will be created while the multiplier effect
at supplier and retail level should boost the number of job
opportunities to about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper quoted SAB Managing Director Andre Parker
as saying that the current beer consumption levels in Kenya are
less than half what they should be.
</P>
<P>
There exists substantial room for growth through the benefit
of healthy competition, a broader choice of products,
advertising, promotions and improved levels of customer service,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The South African venture will directly challenge Kenya
Breweries which used to enjoy a monopoly before the country's
economy was liberalized.
</P>
<P>
The second half-year results in 1996 of Kenya Breweries showed
that its profit before tax increased by 33 percent to more than
17 million U.S. Dollars compared with the first half of last
year.
</P>
<P>
SAB has already established itself in Sub-Saharan Africa and
currently accounted for more than a half of the beer produced and
sold on the African continent.

DHAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Ruling Awami (people's)
League (AL) is likely to elect a new general secretary from
outside the rank of ministers and expand the Central Working
Committee at its council session scheduled to be held next month,
said party sources.
</P>
<P>
"At present the party is looking for a dynamic and energetic
general secretary to expedite the organizational activities," said
a top ranking party leader, adding that a new general secretary
can devote more time to party activities.
</P>
<P>
Zillur Rahman, present general secretary of the AL, also takes
the office of the Minister for Local Government, Rural Development
and Co-operatives.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, AL chief and Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina will formally inaugurate the council session on May 6.
</P>
<P>
"Party general secretary will be elected in consultation with
the councilors while amendments of the party constitution and
manifesto will be brought in light of the recommendations of the
sub-committee formed in this regard," said AL Joint General
Secretary Abdul Jalil.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the party would not bring any major changes to
its constitution and manifesto as it was done in the last council
session held in September, 1992.
</P>

amendments for inclusion of a leader from each district committee
in the Central Working Committee.
</P>

the number of members of the Central Working Committee, now stands
at 65, will raise to more than one hundred," he added.

<HEADLINE> Grain Purchase Goes Smoothly Across China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's grain departments had
purchased 118.5 billion kg of grain from farmers by the end of
March, hitting the highest yearly grain purchase on record.
</P>
<P>
China reaped a bumper grain harvest last year, with a total
production of 490 billion kg, an increase of 23.5 billion kg over
1995.
</P>
<P>
The country raised the grain purchase price by 42 percent this
year, giving a boost to grain farming, and grain departments at
all levels have taken steps to organize the purchasing.
</P>
<P>
The country's grain reserve has shown a steady increase, with
the total reserves in the northeastern provinces and the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region increasing by almost a half over the
highest reported level.
</P>
<P>
To relieve the pressure on purchasing and storing, as much as
6.25 billion kg of grain produced in the northeastern provinces
and Inner Mongolia have been transported into middle or large
cities and low-yield regions.
</P>
<P>
The prices of most of the grain types have remained stable on
the grain market, except for a slight price drop of some specific
varieties. By the end of March, the grain departments had sold
70.5 billion kg of grain.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Hotels to Install Condom Dispensers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- All bars and lodges in Kenya
will soon be required to install condom dispensers in a bid to
prevent HIV/Aids disease, according to a Daily Nation report
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a three-day workshop on HIV/Aids control and
prevention, Tom Okeyo, official of the National Aids and Sexually
Transmitted Diseases Control Program, said the proposed policy had
been approved by Kenyan Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Upon the ratification of the proposal by Kenyan parliament, he
noted, the renewal of licenses for such business would be pegged
on whether they adhered to the requirement.
</P>
<P>
The official told the on-going workshop that the World Bank is
funding 22 HIV/Aids control and prevention projects which will
ensure that any bar or lodge has a condom dispenser.
</P>
<P>
He said, "managing HIV/Aids can be a very simple
matter by treating sexually-transmitted infections and ensuring
that condoms are available to those who need them.
</P>
<P>
Okeyo pointed out that if these two can be achieved, half of
the battle against HIV/Aids disease will have been won, adding
that the pilot project in Nyeri, 150 kilometers northeast
Nairobi, has achieved successful results.
</P>
<P>
Similar efforts in Thailand, Western Europe, North America and
Australia have yielded tremendous results, he said, adding that
the prevalence of HIV/Aids in these regions is on the decline.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 World Population Data Sheet has ranked Kenya among 30
countries whose future population projections will be affected
adversely by the HIV/Aids scourge.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 1.7 million Kenyans who are infected with
the Aids virus in the East African country which has a population
of 28 million.

<HEADLINE> HK to Become World's No. 1 Financial Center: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is most likely to
become the world's number one financial center within the 21st
century, Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration this evening of the Hong Kong
Financial Community Committee for the Celebration of Reunification
 of Hong Kong with China, Tung said, "It is very possible not only
 because we Hong Kong people are hardworking, but also we could
take advantage of the rapid economic development in China."
</P>
<P>
Industry and finance are the most important sectors of Hong
Kong's economy and it could well be expected that they will make
even greater contributions to Hong Kong's economy and bring more
wealth to the 6 million Hong Kong people in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
With 68 days left before Hong Kong's reunification with China,
he said, "we know we are Chinese and we all feel confident and
proud of the reunification."
</P>
<P>
Tung called on the financial community to make even harder
efforts and contribute to Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
The SAR chief executive later joined Yang Zilin and other
chairmen of the committee in a switch-on ceremony to mark the

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Urged to Make Election Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government today
again appealed to all Indonesians to make the general election on
May 29 a success.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Political Affairs Soesilo Soedarman
said here after a meeting with several cabinet ministers and
high-ranking military officers that people have to try their best
to secure the smooth flow and peace and order of the election.
</P>
<P>
"It would be odd if Indonesians, being religious and civilized
and of noble character, could not make the election a success," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government is determined to prevent any
conflict, big or small, as it could damage the campaign and
election.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party Golkar, the United Development Party and the
Indonesian Democratic Party are preparing for the forthcoming
election. They will officially start their campaign on April 27,
which will last until May 23.
</P>
<P>
The three political parties will vie for 425 of the 500 seats
in the House of the Representatives and the remaining 75 seats are
reserved for the armed forces, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
More than 124 million Indonesians are eligible to vote in this
year's election, the seventh since the country's independence in
1945 and the sixth since the New Order administration led by
President Soeharto took office.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar has won all the five general elections since 1971.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.S.-Japan Summit to Focus on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto will leave for Washington later today for talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton on a wide range of issues including
regional security.
</P>
<P>
In their talks on April 25 in Washington, Hashimoto and Clinton
will give priority to regional security issues such as the
U.S. military presence in Okinawa and security in East Asia,
Japanese government officials said.
</P>
<P>
This is Hashimoto's first visit to the U.S. capital since he
took office in January last year. The Hashimoto-Clinton summit is
the sixth but the first since their reelections late last year.
</P>
<P>
Their talks are also expected to cover Japan's trade surplus
and possible Russian participation in the June summit of the Group
of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in Denver, Colorado, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
On the Okinawa issue, Hashimoto will likely play up the
"strength and executive power" of his second-term cabinet by
pointing to his success in maintaining the legal use of land in
Okinawa by U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
Japan hurriedly enacted a revised law last Thursday to allow
the continued compulsory leasing of land for use by the
U.S. forces, a move appreciated by Washington.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 landowners, who own a total of about 36,200 square
meters of land on which 12 U.S. military facilities are stationed,
have refused to renew leases that expire on May 14. Without the
revised law, the continued use of the land by U.S. forces would be
illegal after the date.
</P>
<P>
With the passage of the revised law, described by observers as
Hashimoto's "big present" for the summit, U.S. troops in Okinawa
can legally use the land even after the expiry of the leases.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, which accounts for only 0.6 percent of Japan's total
land, is home to 75 percent of the total land leased by the
U.S. military in the country. More than half of the 47,000
U.S. troops in Japan are stationed in the island prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Discontent among Okinawans over the U.S. military presence has
been rising following a series of assaulting incidents on Japanese
women by U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
While refraining from asking for a cut in the number of
U.S. troops in Japan's southernmost island, Hashimoto is likely to
ask Clinton for more cooperation in alleviating the burden of
people in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Hashimoto and Clinton are expected to
confirm that the U.S. will maintain its current 100,000 military
personnel in the East Asia-Pacific region, as repeatedly stressed
by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Vice President Al
Gore and Secretary of Defense William Cohen in recent visits to
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to confirm the bilateral security
alliance, including their initiative to conclude a review of the
1978 Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation by the fall.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is likely to express his intention of extending the
range of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation to the whole Asia-Pacific
region as he mentioned recently in a meeting with some leaders of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told the LDP group that while reviewing the 1978
Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation, Japan should
consider emergencies not only in the Korean Peninsula, but also in
China's Taiwan and the Nansha Islands, reflecting Japan's
ambitions to interfere in other countries' affairs.
</P>
<P>
Washington is likely to urge Tokyo to step up its efforts
toward domestic demand-led economic growth via deregulation to
contain Japan's trade surplus in automobile and other exports to
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. jumped
11.2 percent over the previous year to 379.83 billion yen (3
billion U.S. dollars) amid strong exports of automobile and office
equipment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have warned Japan against a resurgence of a
trade surplus amid the yen's recent sharp drop against the dollar,
while expressing concerns over Japan's tightening of fiscal
spending and the consumption tax hike as leading to draining
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Another issue may come up in the summit is a U.S. initiative
seeking a new bilateral framework for discussing sector-by-sector
progress in deregulation to provide greater foreign access to
Japan's markets.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory talks for the June G-7 summit in Danver and the
reforms of the United Nations will also be on the agenda of the
summit.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin C May Help Ease Angina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Vitamin C appears to help ease
angina pectoris and in turn prevent its resulting sudden pains in
the chest, a German cardiovascular expert said today.
</P>
<P>
Eberhard Bassenge, of the University of Freiburg, told an
annual conference of the German Society of Cardiologists that the
vitamin could keep conventional pain-killer potent against angina.
</P>
<P>
Many pain-killers become less effective after frequent use to
fight angina, Bassenge noted, adding that his research, however,
shows that vitamin C intake helps prevent this loss of effect.
</P>
<P>
Angina pectoris, which triggers sudden sharp pains in the
chest, is known to be the result of block of blood supply to the
heart due to the narrowing of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
Bassenge, a professor at the German university, added that
vitamin C may also prevent the tendency for blood platelets to
coagulate and thus block blood vessels to the heart.

<HEADLINE> Local PC Maker Signs Big Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Beijing-based Legend Computer
Group, one of the major domestic PC makers, signed a
110-million-US dollar-worth export deal at the on-going 81st China
Export Commodities Fair held here.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement signed between Legend and US-based
Source One Enterprises, Legend will ship 105,000 branded personal
computers to North America over two years.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts considered the deal a breakthrough for China's
domestic PC industry, marking the entrance of Chinese PC makers in
the competitive international market.
</P>
<P>
Legend is China's top PC maker. The group posted sales of
215,000 PCs with a volume of 7.74 billion yuan last year. The
group took a lead in the market share by grabbing 10 percent of
the total, surpassing such big names as IBM, Compaq and HP.
</P>
<P>
According to Zeng Maochao, chairman of Legend, the group in the
past decade turned out China's first batch of computers based on
the 486, Pentium, and Pentium Pro chips. The group also registered
double growth for three years straight since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zeng hoped his group can develop into a large information
industry enterprise competitive in the global market in the next
ten years.
</P>
<P>
Legend pocketed its first export order worth 22 million US
dollars at the previous fair.
</P>
<P>
Also at this fair, Duan Yongji, president of Stone Corporation,
another non-governmental high-tech enterprise, indicated that the
big players in the computer market have shifted the manufacture to
developing countries, including China, in a bid to reduce the
cost. His company has clinched 21 joint ventures with foreign
partners for keeping abreast with the international level.
</P>
<P>
What Stone will focus on in the coming years is developing
software products, he said, adding that major computer
corporations, including IBM, HP, and AST have selected Stone's
Chinese-based software as the standard Chinese environment and
agreed to pre-install the software in their PC products.

"Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the event
of Armed Conflict," also known as the "Hague Convention,"
Deputy-director of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics Ma Zishu
said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are conducting studies on joining the convention," Ma
said. "But we have to consult the ministries of Foreign Affairs,
Civil Affairs and National Defense before we apply."
</P>
<P>
Visiting officials of the United Nation's Education, Science
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) today outlined for Ma the
conventions on international cultural relics protection.
</P>
<P>
Some 89 countries have joined the Hague Convention, which is
one of the three conventions on international cultural heritage
protection, approved by the member countries of UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
They have all promised to protect the cultural properties both
at home and in enemy states during wartime. The cultural
properties under the protection of the convention, which took
effect in 1954, are marked with a shield-shaped pattern in blue
and white.
</P>
<P>
China is a member country of another two conventions, the
"Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property"
(1970), and the convention on returning the stolen or illegally
Exported Cultural Property (1985), which it also helped to draft.

Josiah Thugwane will miss the World Athletics Championships in
Athends in August.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the squad in Johannesburg on Thursday, Athletics
South Africa (ASA) secretary general Banele Sindani said the

in Athens.
</P>
<P>
She has been provisionally included for the last two.
</P>
<P>
Colleen de Reuck, who finished one place behind Meyer in
Boston, told ASA earlier this month that she wanted to concentrate
on the 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Sindani said the final line up would be announced as close to
the IAAF deadline of July 22 as possible and it was possible that
other athletes who performed well before then could be included.

</P>
<P>
Men: Arnaud Malherbe (400m), Hezekiel Sepeng (800m), Marius
van Heerden (800m), Llewellyn Herbert (400m hurdles), Riaan Botha

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South China's Shenzhen city, the
first special economic zone in the country, plans to register an
economic growth rate of 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan set recently, the city plans to produce a
gross domestic product of 112 billion yuan for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Other planned economic targets for this year include a 16
percent increase of fixed assets investment, a 3.3 percent
increase of foreign trade, and a 16.9 percent increase of retail
sales of social commodities.
</P>
<P>
The present comprehensive economic strength of the city ranks
the top fifth of the country's large and medium-sized
cities. Shenzhen's foreign trade volume ranks No.1 among these
cities.
</P>
<P>
The economic development has entered a period of stable
development, said a high-ranking local official.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to use 1.8 billion US dollars of foreign funds
this year, 25 percent less than in last year, said the official,
noting that last year's downward trend of the sum of foreign funds
inflow will have a negative impact on this year.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the city will try to attract more loans from
foreign governments or international financial organizations,
rather than making direct foreign investments the priority.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Model Worker Running Company To Aid Retirees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A retired Chinese model worker
is now running a company to earn money to give to his counterparts
whose pensions don't stretch far enough.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chengzhe, 65, retired in 1992 from Shenyang Casting Plant
of Shenyang city in northeast China's Liaoning Province. He was a
national-level model worker in the 1950s, and was responsible for
nearly 1,000 technical inventions which helped make or save more
than 10 million yuan over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he retired, he opened his brainchild, the
Chengzhe Model Worker Industrial Company, employed more than 7,000
other retired model workers, and now is able to return to society
the overwhelming majority of the firm's profit.
</P>
<P>
Many of the retirees who work for Zhang are in financial
trouble due to the rise in living expenses. Through his company,
Zhang provides subsidies for his workers and gives jobs to their
children.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuxiang, a retired model worker who suffers from uremia,
couldn't afford her medical treatment. Zhang visited her many
times in hospital and paid her medical costs.
</P>
<P>
During Spring festivals, Zhang took gifts and money to the
widow of another model worker. "I have been taken good care of
over the past more than 30 years since my husband passed away,"
the widow said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a plainly dressed man, retains his humble lifestyle. "I
will spend all the money the company earns to ensure the retired
model workers a happy life in their remaining years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The company has set up an orthopedics clinic for the old, and
plans to open a full-service hospital.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's philanthropy has won praise and support from his
community and the local government, and more people are joining
his efforts to lend a hand to the needy.

<HEADLINE> COSCO Calls For A Stable Int'l Shipping Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- COSCO Group, China's flag carrier
for the shipping industry, today marked the 36th anniversary of
its founding by asking for better cooperation between all shipping
contractors in the world to stablize the sector internationally.
</P>
<P>
The call was made here at a news conference for the event,
which was attended by several COSCO leading officials.
</P>
<P>
COSCO officials also asked all shipping firms to compete in a
fair and equal manner, and with mutual trust and improved
cooperation, to maintain a sustained and healthy development of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
The group holds that to compete for market share by cutting
prices will only lead to an unreasonably low price level, mutual
distrust among contractors and disorder in the shipping market,
which is harmful to the entire industry.
</P>
<P>
The officials urged business rivals to improve service and
management, and said that when shipping companies readjust their
regular lines, they should take care not to disturb the balance of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
The leading Chinese shipping firm also asked that hotlines be
set up between major contractors for the purpose of stablizing the
industry.
</P>
<P>
They said COSCO further advocates that outdated ships should be
dismantled, and that environmental protection of seas and oceans
should be a major concern for the industry.
</P>
<P>
At the briefing, COSCO spokesman Gao Weijie told a group of
local journalists that the company was founded in 1961 and now
owns nearly 600 vessels of various types with a total of 17
million dwt.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 and 1996, COSCO's vessels transported 117 million tons
and 112 million tons of goods respectively.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that the Chinese shipping firm will compete with its
advantages and quality service, and will strive to standardize the
international shipping market and curb unfair competition.

BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chairman and CEO of Sun
Microsystems, Inc., one of the world's leading network computer
enterprises, says here today that his company will invest billions
of US dollars on the exploitation of computer network technology
in China in the "foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
Scott McNealy said at a press conference that China is in the
enviable position of being poised to gain from the Internet like
no other country before it.
</P>
<P>
"China's leaders have the vision to create an infrastructure
built on the very latest technology that not only optimizes
performance and accelerates the population's access to it but also
enables the Internet to be a vehicle for viable electronic
commerce," McNealy said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his eagerness to share Sun's knowledge and
experience in this area with China.
</P>
<P>
As an Internet pioneer, Sun technology helped form the backbone
of the explosive growth of the global information network. Sun's
Java, a platform-independent programming environment that was
designed for the Internet and corporate network computing, allows
developers to create applications that can be adapted to any
computer system.
</P>
<P>
With offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Hong
Kong, Sun's global strategic area is China's inland areas and Hong

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Industries Asked to Treat Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Environment (DOE)
of Bangladesh has directed the industries concerned to set up
waste treatment plants to treat the solid and chemical waste they
release, DOE officials said.
</P>
<P>
The DOE has identified 1,167 industrial units as heavy
polluters and served notices on them for taking effective measures
to control environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the department said about 14,000 tons of
solid waste and 16,000 cubic meters of chemical waste are
discharged by the industries every year into the rivers in the
capital Dhaka and its adjacent areas.
</P>
<P>
It also said more than 1,200 factories in the country discharge
about 35,000 cubic meters of waste into rivers everyday.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey report, major polluters include
fertilizer, pulp and paper, dyeing, textile and iron and steel
industries.
</P>
<P>
The industries, set up without proper planning and waste
treatment plants, have produced many environmentally harmful
effects by releasing toxic chemicals, solid waste and effluents,
the report said. It added that many such industries were built
near the banks of rivers for quick disposal of waste.

</P>
<P>
Describing the European mediation in the peace process as
complementing the U.S. role, he noted that his talks with French
top officials focused on obstacles hindering the peace march, as
well as the French and European efforts in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly will hold an emergency session later
today to discuss Israel's settlement activities in Arab East
Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision last month to build 6,500 Jewish homes in
disputed East Jerusalem has stalled the peace talks and sparked
violence in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Arab group in the U.N. has been seeking a majority of the
185-member General Assembly to stage the special session since
the U.S. last month vetoed two U.N. Security Council resolutions
criticizing Israel on the settlement issue.
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, Syria, three state-run newspapers today also
urged the U.N. General Assembly to impose swift sanctions against
Israel to stop it from building new settlements on Arab lands.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesian Gov't Determined to Hold Smooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
taken many effective measures, including allocation of a huge fund
and deployment of heavy troops in all important areas, to
maintain security and order for holding a smooth general election
scheduled for May 29.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the three government-recognized contestants --
the ruling party Golkar, the United Development Party (PPP) and
the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) in Jakarta received an
additional 250 million rupiah (one US dollar equals 2,340 rupiah)
each in campaign funds from the city budget.
</P>
<P>
Reports said other provincial administrations have also
provided additional funds to the parties, which had earlier
received 500 million rupiah each from the central government.
</P>
<P>
While no official figures are available on how much money will
be used for security purpose, Finance Minister Mar'ie Huhamad said
no less than 90 million US dollars has been earmarked for the
election which is held every five years.
</P>
<P>
A Jakarta daily, however, quoting an unnamed police source
saying that 8 billion rupiah has been set aside for security
purposes.
</P>
<P>
This means that each of Indonesia's 27 provinces will get an
average of 10 million rupiah every day throughout the campaign
period which starts on April 27 and winds up on May 23.
</P>
<P>
This year's general election is Indonesia's seventh since it
gained independence in 1945 and the sixth since the new order
administration under President Soeharto rose to power.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that judging from the country's history of
having a high participation rate in general elections, most of the
120 million eligible voters are likely to flock to the 305,508
polling booths across the archipelago this year.
</P>
<P>
The three political parties vie for 425 of the 500 seats of the
House of Representatives (DPR) in the forthcoming election. The
remaining 75 seats are reserved for the Indonesian armed forces
whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
Aside from deploying security personnel, mainly from the
national police, with the support of the army, navy, air force and
civilian defense units, the government has also formulated a new
set of regulations preventing supporters of Golkar, PPP and PDI
from clashing.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Indonesian Police Information Service Brig. Gen.
Nurfaizi has said recently that security maintenance for the 1997
general election will cover three periods.
</P>
<P>
"The first is what we call the pre-event period, the second is
the May 29 general election, and the third is the post-event
period which will last until the 1998 General Assembly of the
People's Deliberative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest
legislative body," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the pre-event period, the police will deploy 19,000
policemen, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"However, on the 'peak day' of May 29, no less than 126,000
policemen will be fielded," he said, adding that the figure
constitutes more than two-thirds of the country's police force."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the army, navy and air force along with civilian
defense units have declared their readiness to ensure that the
general election will proceed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The government has also asked the three political parties to
set up their own security forces which will work in coordination
with the police and the military.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the financial and security preparations, analysts
said the government looks set to have a smooth and orderly general
election.
</P>
<P>
After all, they added, President Soeharto himself has said that
a general election which is free from any obstacle, disturbance
and threat from any body for any reason is a must.

<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The course of RAC Rally this year
will be the shortest route in the event's history, it was revealed
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the organisers insist that the rally, which has been
re-instated as a World Championship event, has lost none of the
qualities which make it one of the most challenging courses on the
world circuit.
</P>
<P>
In a major departure from last year's route, the event, spread
over three days from November 23-25, will omit the gruelling
Kielder Forest section in the Scottish Borders which claimed many
leading contenders in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This year's forest stages will take place on the final leg in
South Wales on roads which have not been used by an international
rally for a decade.

<HEADLINE> HK MTR Platforms To Get Screen Doors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Mass Transit
Railway Corporation (MTRC) has decided to install platform screen
doors on all its 28 underground stations, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after years of deliberation and a feasibility
study involving a pilot test at Choi Hung station, MTRC operations
director Bill Donald said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The screen doors will stop accidents, especially on overcrowded
platforms, and suicides by cutting off access to the railway
tracks.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, much of the 35 million HK dollars (4.5
million US dollars) the MTRC spends annually on electricity at its
stations will be saved because the screen doors will prevent
air-conditioning from being lost in the tunnels.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is estimated to cost one billion HK dollars (128
million US dollars), with work expected to begin within the next
two years, Donald said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the MTRC's new signaling system had already taken
into account the possibility of screen doors being installed.
</P>
<P>
Under the new signaling system, train-stopping positions would
be adapted to achieve the accuracy needed to operate the doors.
</P>
<P>
The MTRC's 10 above-ground stations are not included in the
project because their platforms are not air-conditioned.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan Wednesday
accused Zairean rebels of "killing by starvation" the Rwandan Hutu
refugees, and called on the rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila to
let international humanitarian organizations reach thousands of
refugees abandoned to their own fate in the rebel-controlled zone.
</P>
<P>
-- Belgian police arrested on Wednesday a suspect in the affair
of trash sacks containing human remains in the region of Mons.
Belgian police have also identified one of the victims of the
serial-killing -- a woman whose head was discovered in one of the
trash-sacks found earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>

appointing a new cabinet after the legislative elections. A poll
showed that most French people prefer socialist Martine Aubry or
former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to be the country's new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a report by the European Commission, 13 countries
out of the 15 European Union members are ready to attain the deficit
criteria for joining the European single currency in January 1999.
Only Greece, whose public deficit stays at 4.9 percent of its gross
domestic product, and Italy, which is calling in vain for a relaxing
of the deficit criteria, will not meet the deadline.

KATHMANDU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Five Nepali youths are to leave
here to climb Mt. Qomolangma through the south face to mark the
forthcoming 14th World Youth and Student Festival in Cuba, a youth
organization announced today.

<P>
All the five members of the Qomolangma expedition are below the
age of 35 and have experiences climbing mountains above 8,000
meters, according to the Democratic National Youth Federation of
Nepal, which sponsored and organized the expedition.

The team will establish only three camps including the base
camp before they launch assaults to the 8,848-meter-high summit,
organizers said.
</P>

The Qomolangma expedition is organized to show Nepali youths'
commitment to world peace and mark the 14th World Youth and

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Accounting Society to Remain Independent After July 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Society of
Accountants will remain independent after China resumes the
exercise of power over Hong Kong on July 1, a Chinese government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
As a civil organization of accountants, the Hong Kong Society
of Accountants will continue to be independent after July 1, Ding
Pingzhun, Secretary General of the Chinese Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, said at a news briefing prior to an
international seminar on China's economic reform and the opening
of its accountancy market.
</P>
<P>
Ding said that the friendly cooperation between the Chinese
Institute and the Hong Kong Society has contributed greatly to the
economic and trade relations between China's inland areas and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the Chinese
Institute and the Hong Kong Society do not subordinate to each
other and will not interfere with each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The relations between the Institute and the Society will be
like two brothers," he told journalists.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar will be attended by nearly 500 accounting
officials and experts from China and a number of other countries
and regions in the Asia-Pacific area, according to the
co-sponsors, the Institute and the Society.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts to Improve Creativity of Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Experts said the current
education system must be improved to help develop the creativity
of youngsters, as the latest survey suggests that the system has
hindered students' creativity.
</P>
<P>
The China University of Political Science and Law began to
conduct the survey on the training of youngsters' creativity in
May, 1996, among 2,000 students in ten universities and colleges
and ten high schools.
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of the respondents think that the education of
middle and primary schools aims at enabling students to enter
universities, while 53 percent agree that "the education methods
conflict with the cultivation of creativity", according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
This shows the current examination-oriented education system is
not favorable for the development of the youngsters' creativity,
said Ma Kangmei, head of the advising group of the survey and
vice-president of the China University of Political Science and
Law.
</P>
<P>
She said that only 42 percent of the students attach importance
to the book and other tools, provided by their families and
schools for development of creativity, but 78 percent of them
agreed that "in their teachers' eyes, a good student should be
obedient and always listen to the teachers."
</P>
<P>
This showed that under the traditional influence, schools,
families, and society do not pay much attention to the cultivation
of students' creativity, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the survey also discovered that the text books
are outdated and have lost contact with the reality and that the
student's knowledge structure is irrational. For example, 38
percent of the students said the knowledge they acquired at school
can only fetter the development of their creativity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 20 percent of the junior middle school
students, 30 percent of the senior middle school students and half
of the college students think that their teachers give lessons
through "cramming", which indicates that teachers and parents
should improve themselves to provide better education.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that the simplistic teaching style and
the lack of funds in both school and family education hindered the
development of the youngsters' creativity.
</P>
<P>
"Creativity should be the prime theme of the education," said
Zhang Kaixun, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference and the China
Inventors' Association. He added that the students can only
succeed in their future careers by learning to use the knowledge
creatively.
</P>
<P>
Experts urged that to cultivate the students' creativity, the
examination-oriented education system should be reformed, the text
books be updated and the teachers and parents be trained to
improve their educational concepts, knowledge structure, and
education methods.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the youngsters to study the Intellectual
Property Protection Law, and grow up to be creative, talented people
with a good legal awareness.

<HEADLINE> HK Court Insolvency Cases Up 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of new court
insolvencies in Hong Kong hit 1,119 in 1996-97, up 10 percent
against the previous year, the Official Receiver, Robin Hearder,
revealed today.
</P>
<P>
But the figure was still low in comparison with overseas
jurisdictions in view of the huge volume of economic activities in
Hong Kong, Hearder said when reviewing the work of the Official
Receiver's Office in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
There were 557 new compulsory company liquidations in the year,
accounting for less than one percent of the total number of new
companies incorporated in the year, or around 0.1 percent of the
total number of companies in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A decline in business, cash flow problems and poor management
were among the major causes of failure.
</P>
<P>
New bankruptcies totaled 562 during 1996-97, the first year
since 1988-89 with the number of new bankruptcies exceeding that
of new compulsory company liquidations.
</P>
<P>
Inability to meet liabilities arising from personal guarantees,
a decline in business and excessive use of personal credit
facilities bore the blame for the bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
Sectors affected by compulsory company liquidations and
bankruptcies included garment and knitting manufacturing,
importers and exporters, restaurants and canteens, electrical and
electronic manufacturing, construction and engineering, land and
property development and investment, as well as plastic products
manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls for Efforts to Save Mideast peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today described Egypt's hard-earned peace with Israel as a model
for Arabs and called for efforts to save the Mideast process from
total collapse.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remarks in an address to the nation on the
occasion of the 15th anniversary of liberation of Egypt's Sinai
Peninsula from the 15-year Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"Such a just peace would re-arrange relations among peoples in
the region on new bases that guarantee good neighborly ties,
balanced interests and would also achieve security for all
parties," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Peace between Egypt and Israel is a true model of balanced
peace that managed to weather fierce storms as it was based on
balanced rights and interests."
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in
1979 and a key mediator in the peace process. But ties between
the two countries have been cool. Tensions are mounting since
Israel began last month to build 6,500 Jewish homes in disputed
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned that the peace process is facing a severe and
critical test after having taken long strides ahead.
</P>
<P>
"I feared that the present violence in the occupied territories
would escalate into a dangerous extent as a result of continued
settlement policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the president said he is confident that the majority of
Palestinians and Israelis still wish to pursue the peace march and
hope for a peaceful co-existence that would erase the "remnants of
fear, hate and mutual mistrust."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak called on the Palestinians to overcome "feelings of
frustration and despair" and remain confident that just peace
would triumph despite all difficulties and ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged Israel to realize that security comes only
with mutual recognition between the different parties, otherwise,
nothing else could compensate for peace.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Mubarak called on peace advocates in the whole
world to back the Arab efforts for the sake of salvaging the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also urged peace march partners to exert their utmost in
order to contain the peril before damage escalates, warning that
the alternative would be "dangerous and fearsome."

<HEADLINE> SA's Arms Sale to Uganda No Harmful to Peace: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National
Conventional Arms Control Committee Chairman Kader Asmal has
admitted that his country is supplying arms to Uganda, which is
alleged to be the main supporters of Zairean rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
The sale of "modest amount of arms to Uganda for defense
purposes" was "perfectly legal" and South Africa had a guarantee
from Uganda that the weapons would not be rechanneled to the
rebels in Zaire, today's Business Day quoted Asmal as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said the arms sale would not have an impact on the South
Africa-broked peace talks aimed at resolving the crisis in the
Great Lake region between Zairean President Mobuto Sese Seko and
Laurent Kabila, the leader of Zairean rebels.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was exporting only small and limited amounts, not
truckloads of arms and "I don't see its relevance to the peace
talks," Asmal stressed.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Minister Joe Modise also said Uganda had
advised that it had complied with the end-user certificates with
regard to the arms and equipment supplied by South Africa.
</P>
<P>
All exports of arms required an end-user certificate which was
internationally recognized "undertaking by the government of the
recipient country that the items purchased were for its sole use and
not destined for transfer or re-export", Modise said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Germany's Rising Crime Boosts Private Security Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Private security services are
booming in Germany as a result of the rising crime and inadequate
police forces, and their total business volume doubled over 1991
to about 5 billion marks (about 3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
As factors that have boosted Germany's private security sector,
which now employs 112,000 people, said German press reports today,
more German companies are hiring outside security guards and
insurance companies' security provisions are increasingly strict.
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1995, while crime cases nearly doubled to 6.7
million, police officers increased by one quarter to 280,000.
Nearly 40 percent of Germans in a recent survey regarded domestic
security as the country's biggest political problem at present.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also showed that theft alone causes 4 billion marks
(2.4 billion dollars) loss to retail businesses each year. And the
damage caused by industrial espionage is estimated to amount to 20
billion marks (12 billion dollars), said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Germany's private security firms carry out security checks at
nine German airports and offer detective services. They also guard
factories, cash transports, military facilities, homes for asylum
seekers, nuclear power plants, and underground trains and stations.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports criticizing the martial-style behavior
of private security guards at underground stations, the
recruitment of rightists as well as bungled operations, which have
affected the image of the sector.
</P>
<P>
Pay in the sector runs relatively low, ranging from 8.70 marks
(5.22 dollars) an hour for a security guard in the country's
eastern state of Thuringia to at least 15 marks (9.0 dollars) in
the western state of North Rhine Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of all security guards in Germany are workers,
the reports said. Government regulations as of April 1996 require
newcomers in the security sector to have a training course of 40
hours.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Ethnic Region to Become Large Fertilizer Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China has designated its
northwest Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to be one of the key
areas to develop the chemical industry, turning the region into a
major nitrogenous fertilizer production base in China, according
to sources from the Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI).
</P>
<P>
Six large fertilizer production facilities with a combined
capacity of 1.2 million tons of synthetic ammonia have been or
will be underway in the region, said an official with the MCI.
</P>
<P>
The projects are to use Xinjiang's rich natural gas resources
as the raw material, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Urumqi Petrochemical Plant has almost finalized the
construction of a facility with a production capacity of 300,000
tons of synthetic ammonia. The first batch of carbamide is
expected to be turned out from the plant next month.
</P>
<P>
A similar facility with a capacity of 100,000 tons at the
Xinjiang Chemical Fertilizer Plant is set to finish construction
within the year.
</P>
<P>
Another four facilities funded by the state, two
300,000-tonnage plants in Korla, one the same size in Kuqa and one
200,000-tonnage plant in Zepu, are doing feasibility studies on
localization of equipment or evaluating investments and the
environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, Chinese minister of Chemical Industry, revealed in
a recent national conference on chemical construction that the
country planned to build 470 large- and medium-sized chemical
projects with a total investment of 260 billion yuan. Agro-related
projects, in particular chemical fertilizer and pesticide
production, will be given priority, she said.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Deployed to 38 Locations in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Troops of the West African
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, have been deployed to 38
locations outside the Liberian capital of Monrovia, a report
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
This will make things easy for ECOMOG to dispatch troops to
all voting centers across the country to keep order for the
forthcoming May 30 elections, the report said, quoting ECOMOG
Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
Malu made the remarks during a meeting on Wednesday with a
delegation of the Carter Center, a US-based organization working
in furtherance of democratic elections around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to him, all sea ports and most of the border
crossing points were now being effectively policed by ECOMOG to
further enhance security nationwide, prevent arms movement in or
out of Liberia and give confidence to returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian general reiterated ECOMOG was working hard to
ensure that the elections would be conducted in a very
transparent and honest environment so that if a party lost, such
party would know that it lost because the Liberian people
rejected it and not because of fraud.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was already fully prepared to deal with such situation
under which anyone attempted to cause trouble after such an
honest election, Malu warned.
</P>
<P>
According to Gordon Streeb, leader of the delegation, the
former US president Jimmy Carter would lead a delegation of about
60 observers to Liberia as a reflection of the importance the
center attaches to the success of the country's post-war
elections.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Carter and his delegation to monitor the
elections is also seen as part of efforts to enhance the
credibility of the polls.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Vows Yield to U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar today reiterated its
policies, aims and objectives already laid down, saying, "There is
no reason to deviate from its original path to serve the interests
of a foreign government."
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions imposed by the United States on Myanmar, we
believe, are for their own domestic political consumption," said
an official statement released here today.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar has opened its doors to outside investments and its
abundant natural resources will benefit all those who come to
invest," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"But if the United States refuses to come in to invest or pull
its companies out of doing business in Myanmar, we can only feel
sorry for the U.S. companies, because they will not get a second
chance later to invest in Myanmar if opportunities are taken over
by companies from nations with consistent foreign policies," the
statement warned.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government announced its decision on Tuesday to ban
new U.S. investment in Myanmar. However, the ban is reported not
to affect existing U.S. investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States halted direct financial assistance and
blocked much international aid to Myanmar since the Myanmar State
Law and Order Restoration Council took over state power in 1988.
It has also barred the entry of certain Myanmar officials into the
country since last October.
</P>
<P>
Of the total foreign investment of over 6 billion U.S. dollars
in Myanmar by the end of March this year, the United States ranks
fourth with 582 million dollars in 16 projects after Britain,
Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Major U.S. investment in Myanmar involves UNOCAL and TEXACO oil
 companies' natural gas development at two Myanmar offshore gas
fields, the Yadana and the Yetagun.

<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The West African peace-keeping
force in Liberia known as ECOMOG has discovered a large quantity
of hidden arms at the country's border with Ivory Coast, a report
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Commander Victor Malu was quoted as saying on Wednesday
that the arms were found in the area formerly controlled by the
National Patriotic Front of Liberia led by Charles Taylor, who is
widely regarded as one of the most hopeful presidential candidate
in the May 30 elections.
</P>
<P>
Among the arms discovered were large quantities of bombs and
ammunitions, anti-aircraft guns, 105 mm guns and anti-tank guns
and motors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Malu said his force is still interrogating the persons found
carrying the weapons, and that once enough information is
gathered, Taylor would be called for questioning.
</P>
<P>
The commander declined to mention what action he would take if
Taylor is eventually implicated, but said that the situation
would not be a threat to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the January 31 deadline for Liberian faction fighters to
surrenders their arms, the peace-keepers in early March found several
trucks of arms in the house of Alhaji Kromah, the leader of the United
Liberation Movement.
</P>
<P>
Kromah was first arrested and was to be prosecuted but was later

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The oil city of Warri in southern
Nigeria witnessed calm on Wednesday for the first time in a month
following the deployment of troops to put in check the orgy of
violence there, according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out between the Itsekiri and Ijaw tribes on
March 24 following the relocation of the headquarters of the
Warri South Local Government from where Ijaws live to an
Itsekiri-inhabited area.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 people died in the communal clashes with property
worth millions of Naira damaged.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier sent Naval personnel and gunship to
help the police to restore peace there. But the Naval presence
was minimal and the situation seemed to be beyond the police.
</P>
<P>
"There is a constitutional role for the Army. It is to help
the police maintain law and order in the country. If the
situation is beyond the police, the Army can go there to help,"
said Col. Godwin Ugbo, the acting director of defence
information.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on the strength of the troops deployed
to the area.
</P>
<P>
In Abuja, the Nigerian capital, Petroleum Resources Minister
Chief Dan Etete warned on Wednesday that the government would no
longer tolerate situations in which host communities hold oil
companies to ransome to register their protest.
</P>
<P>
He said the community leaders in such areas owed it a duty to
restrain their youths from taking out their disputes on oil
installations.
</P>
<P>
In the early stage of the crisis, the Ijaw people held hostage
127 oil workers of Shell Petroleum Development Company and 50 oil
traders in order to arouse government attention to their protest
against the relocation of local government.
</P>
<P>
Some of the production facilities of Shell and Chevron have
been damaged, forcing a cut down in their crude oil production.

<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Haikou Textile and Dye Mill,
the largest failing state-owned enterprises in south China's
island province of Hainan, has decided to auction off its assets
to pay for its debts.
</P>
<P>
The mill has 68 million yuan in registered capital, and has
1,728 employees including 34 retired people on its payroll.
</P>
<P>
The mill has been running a deficit ever since it was set up in
1986, because of chaotic management practices. It declared
bankruptcy in December of last year, with total assets of 213
million yuan, and a debt burden reaching 362 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The mill will be auctioned off at a base price of 130 million
yuan on the 8th of next month. All transactions are to be handled
with one payment and within 15 days, China Business Times reports.
</P>
<P>
The mill's employees have two options: one is to collect
three-years' salary in one lump sum and to look for a job by
themselves, the other is to accept training and possible
re-employment arrangements from the government.
</P>
<P>
The mill's losses account for nearly half of the total amount
of losses of the state-owned industrial enterprises in Haikou, the
province's capital.

The week average inter-bank mid-rate declined to 1,050

<HEADLINE> Equality Among All Nationalities Ensures Stability in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Political equality among all
nationalities has ensured social stability and encouraged economic
development in Inner Mongolia, one of China's five autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
Ulgi, Chairman of the People's Government of Inner Mongolia,
said the gross domestic product (GDP) in his region reached 98.3
billion yuan (some 12 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, and the
region's economic growth increased by 12.4 percent, higher than
China's average figure.
</P>
<P>
The annual net income of farmers and herdsmen came to 1,602
yuan (200 dollars) in 1996, registering a 23.2 percent increase
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievements to the political equality among
all nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that Inner Mongolia registered 169,700
officials of China's ethnic minority groups, accounting for 23.43
of the region's total.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, occupying a land space of 1.18 million square
kilometers, has a population of 23 million, 3.78 million of which
are Mongolians.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region was established in May 1, 1947, Ulgi
said, adding that this was the Chinese Communist Party's "first
experience" in implementing its autonomous policy in ethnic
minority areas.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the regional commission of
nationalities affairs, the leading officials in towns of minority
nationalities are chosen from ethnic minority groups; in counties
of Han nationality, the head officials are usually Han.
</P>
<P>
For example, though the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, or Alihe
Town, only has an Oroqen population of more than 2,000, the
leading officials there are from the Oroqen nationality.
</P>
<P>
It is also the case in four other Chinese autonomous regions,
namely the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Tibet
Autonomous Region, an official with the State Nationalities
Affairs Commission said.
</P>
<P>
An official with the region's Education Bureau said his region
has also been attentive to the development of the languages of the
minority nationalities.
</P>
<P>
He said the classes taught in Mongolian are very popular in
primary schools and universities in his region, and preferential
policies have been adopted covering ethnic people's university
enrollment, employment and promotion.
</P>
<P>
The region has also adopted a law stipulating that the official
documents and units' signs must be written in both Mongolian and
Han characters.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he added, the region also urged Han officials
in minority areas to study the Mongolian language, and those who
master it will receive an award from the regional government.

<HEADLINE> Bumper Year for S.African Wine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is expected to have
another bumper wine-producing year in 1997, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
The KWV, leading wine co-operative of the country, said on Wednesday
that South African wine sales are currently booming in Britain and
other European markets.
</P>
<P>
"Indications are that the crop could be another 984 million litres.
This will be approximately three percent smaller than last year's
record crop," said KWV Chairman Lourens Jonker at the company's annual
general meeting in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Jonker said the 1997 crop would be the third largest in history.
</P>
<P>
According to KWV's annual report released earlier this month, the
company's export volumes rose by 35 percent to 11.1 million cases in
1996, compared to 8.2 million cases in 1995.
</P>
<P>
While in value, the company earned the country 550 million Rand
(about 125 million US Dollar) in 1996, almost a 50 percent rise
compared to that in 1995.
</P>
<P>
KWV said South African wine was being exported to about 60
countries worldwide, with the European Union being the biggest
single foreign consumer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, domestic demand for good quality wine has also grown
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Increased tourism, a wider range of wines on offer and higher
disposable income among Black consumers all contribued to increase
sales, said the source. enditem

<P>
LUSAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Lusaka City Council (LCC) has
decided to lease the play parks in the capital city of Zambia to
non-profitable organizations to protect their botanical beauty
from commercial activities.
</P>

The leased parks should be developed within six months or the

The organizations have to ensure that the parks will not pose
danger to children and there will not be any sanitary danger or
hazardous situation for children.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in southwest China is making preparations for flood
prevention to ensure a good harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Kejie, chairman of the regional government, said that
five tasks should be in local leaders' agendas: reinforcing
dangerous dykes and dams; clearing away obstacles in rivers and
lakes; making preparations for the distribution of building
materials; forecasting floods; and improving the work to direct
flood prevention.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi suffered flood and drought disasters in 1988, 1995, and
1996, with direct economic losses estimated at 60 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The region has now put water conservancy construction as the
first priority of all infrastructure facilities. Since 1996, the
whole region has spent nearly 500 million yuan on water
conservancy construction.

<HEADLINE> Dwarf Maize Produces High Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agronomists are
introducing a dwarf maize into farming production. The new strains
have shown per-unit output increases of 15-30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new corn have been planted on a trial basis on nearly
423,000 ha of farmland in north, northeast, and northwest China
over the past few years, and added a total maize output of 950
million kg.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Youzhi, a senior agronomist of the Agricultural Bureau of
Zhangjiakou City in north China's Hebei Province, began his
research on dwarf maize in the 1960s, and succeeded in cultivating
the first new strain in 1988, experimental planting of which
proved encouraging.
</P>
<P>
The new strain was planted on some 20,000 ha in the suburbs of
the city last year, and had an average per-hectare output of
12,750 kg.
</P>
<P>
The new strain, 70-100 cm lower than traditional maize strains,
is fit for close planting. More farmers have begun to accept
dwarf maize and expect high yields.

<HEADLINE> Five-Nation Accord Hailed As Unprecedented Achievement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan today hailed the agreement
on border arms reduction between the five countries as "an
unprecedented achievement."
</P>
<P>
In separate speeches delivered after the signing of the accord
in the Kremlin, the presidents unanimously extolled the document
as of historic significance to security and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, a result of over seven years of negotiations,
provides detailed measures to reduce military forces and armaments
within a depth of 100 kilometers from the border lines between
China and the other four countries which share a 7,000 kilometer
long border.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said in his speech that the
signing of the accord conduces to maintaining peace, stability and
tranquillity in the border areas and facilitating further growth
of good-neighborly relations, friendship, mutual trust on the
basis of equality and mutually-beneficial cooperation between the
five countries.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it "offers a security model different from the
Cold-War mentality in safeguarding peace, security and stability
in the Asia Pacific region and the world at large, thereby opening
up a useful way for the enhancement of mutual trust among the
states," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that thanks to the
brand-new atmosphere between the five countries, they have been
able to discuss and tackle in real earnest all the most
complicated problems to formulate the unique document.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the accord will consolidate mutual trust
among all parties and exert positive impact on the relations
between them, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said that the
agreement will be a factor to enhance stability and trust in the
region and promote peace and friendship between the five countries.
</P>
<P>
The document is oriented toward the 21st century and will be
recorded in the history of world politics, Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan set a high value on the
accord and described it as a proper one of historic and political
importance.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders of the five countries have established a fresh
basis of international law in the field of military cooperation
and made great contribution to setting up the framework of
security and stability in the Asia Pacific region, Akayev said.
</P>
<P>
President Emomali Rakhmonov of Tajikistan regarded the signing
of the document as an important event in the irreversible process
of building up trust and stability in the border areas between
China and the four countries.
</P>
<P>
The accord, together with the agreement on confidence building
in the military field in border areas between the five countries
reached a year ago, will help solve the remaining problems in
fixing border lines between China and the four countries,
Rakhmonov said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Providing Large Loans For Railway Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's State Development Bank
has provided a total of 32.8 billion yuan in loans for railway
projects over the past three years, accounting for 12 percent of
the country's total amount of loans in Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
The funds were used for 49 large and medium-sized programs,
including the Beijing-Kowloon, Baoji-Zhongwei, and Nanning-Kunming
railway lines, China Business Times reports.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, loans for railway projects
amounted to 2.2 billion yuan, and the figure is expected to reach
11.7 billion yuan by the year's end, bank sources say.
</P>
<P>
During the first three years of the country's Eighth Five-Year
Plan (1991-95), only 5.45 billion yuan in loans went to railways,
far less than those made by the State Development Bank alone,
which was founded three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Five-Nation Accord on Border Arms Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan signed an agreement on
reduction of military forces in border areas in the Kremlin today,
which is the first of its kind in the Asia Pacific region and also
a result of over seven years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Talks on the accord initially began between China and the
former Soviet Union in November 1989, in line with the agreement
reached by the then top leaders of the two countries on the issue.
</P>
<P>
In April 1990, the Governments of China and the former Soviet
Union signed an agreement on guiding principles of reduction of
military forces and confidence building in the military field in
border areas.
</P>
<P>
After the former Soviet Union broke up and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) was formed, the talks resumed in 1992
between China and the four CIS members -- Russia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, 1996, the presidents of China, Russia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan signed an agreement on confidence
building in the military field in border areas in Shanghai, China.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the parties further reached consensus on
details of the agreement on reduction of military forces in border
areas, which was inked by the presidents this morning.
</P>
<P>
Sources told Xinhua that under the agreement, all sides will
cut down the number of their army, air forces and units of air
defense forces to no more than 130,400, respectively, within a
depth of 100 kilometers from the border lines.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also sets a maximum quantity limit of major arms
deployed in the areas and defines the ways and timetable of the
reduction, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The border lines between China and the other four countries
total more than 7,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, valid until the end of the year 2020, stipulates
that all parties will reduce military forces in the areas to the
minimum level that suits only defensive needs and accords with
their good-neighborly and friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
All parties of the agreement will not seek unilateral military
superiority and their forces in the areas will not wage any
offensive against one another.
</P>
<P>
They will also exchange regularly relevant military information
about the areas, which will be kept secret to any third party, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Mutual supervision will be conducted over implementation of the
agreement, they said.

<HEADLINE> Most Chinese Workers Work Five Days A Week (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Of China's 150 million or so
urban employees, some 140 million now enjoy two days-off a week,
thanks to the five-day-work-week system China adopted on May 1,
1995.
</P>
<P>
Chinese workers used to work 48 hours, or six days, a week.
Their work time was first reduced to five and a half days in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Xu Lianyou, director of the Occupation, Safety and Hygiene
Department under the Ministry of Labor, said here today that the
five-day-work-week is now in practice in an overwhelming majority
of the Chinese enterprises and social institutions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that all employees of government departments,
social organizations and institutions in China currently work 40
hours a week.
</P>
<P>
The five-day-work-week has also been adopted by 90 percent of
the state-owned enterprises, over 80 percent of the
collectively-owned enterprises above the county level, and most
foreign-funded and township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, the
five-day-work-week had been introduced in 86.9 percent of the
local enterprises by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of state-owned, collectively-owned, foreign-funded
and private enterprises that had adopted the new system was
respectively 95, 93, and 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The new system has won enthusiastic response among the urban
employees, since it helps create more job opportunities, guarantee
the workers' legitimate rights and interests, and improve their
living quality," said Xu, the director.
</P>
<P>
Another favorable side-effect of the system is that it has
helped to promote the development of the service industry,
especially in tourism.

<P>
In 1996, China's domestic tourists totaled 639 million,
bringing 163.8 billion yuan (about 20 billion US dollars) to the
tourism industry. The same two figures for 1994 were only 450
million and 95 billion respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, "weekend tourism" has also added much pressure to the
country's underdeveloped traffic system.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, tens of thousands of people swarmed out of the
city to spend the weekends in neighboring provinces, causing much
trouble for the local railway, air, and road transport departments.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, enterprises that have not adopted
five-day-work-week are mainly some overseas-funded or private
enterprises that lack proper management.
</P>
<P>
"Owners of these enterprises want to increase production and
earn more profits through prolonged work time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were also a small number of migrant workers
who thought that the new system would prevent them from "earning
more money through doing more work," which Xu called a
"misunderstanding."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the reduction of work hours has led to an increase
of the average hourly wage, and the labor law ensures that overtime
work is paid more," said Xu, adding that the workers' income would
only rise under the new system.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the State Council, giving full consideration to
the possible difficulties in the introduction of the new system,
had given all enterprises a grace period of two years, which ends
on May 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
"The deadline is just several days to go," he warned. "After
that, anyone that insists on rejecting the new system will receive
administrative penalties from the labor departments in accordance
with the law".

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Considers Approving Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The question of Pakistan's
ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is under
active consideration by the government, a Foreign Office spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
However, it is necessary that all the preparatory work relating
to this convention including documentation of the entire chemical
and allied industry in Pakistan be completed, the spokesman said
at a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of taking steps in this direction," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's decision to ratify the CWC will also be guided by
the position of the rest of the international community, in
particular those states that possess chemical weapons as well as
those in possession of other weapons of mass destruction, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Pakistan is a signatory to the CWC and subscribes
to its objectives of promoting disarmament and non-proliferation
of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
And Pakistan has always been an ardent advocate of a complete
ban on the development, production, stockpiling and use of
chemical weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
The use of chemical agents for the purposes of warfare has
never figured in Pakistan's defense doctrines, the spokesman
declared.

BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui
Tiankai said here today that China is deeply displeased by US
leaders' meeting the Dalai Lama, saying that the US allowed him to
carry out his separatist activities in the US.
</P>
<P>
"China has made clear its stand over the issue to the US side."
Cui said.
</P>
<P>
"China resolutely opposes any actions conniving at and
supporting the Dalai Lama in splitting the motherland, and this
position of China is clear and consistent," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The door of negotiations between China's central government and
the Dalai Lama is always open, the spokesman said, adding that
the fundamental principle is that the Dalai Lama must recognize
Tibet as an inalienable part of the Chinese territory and totally
abandon the notion of the independence of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Dalai Lama must show his sincerity
through practical actions instead of hypocritical words aimed at
deceiving public opinion, so as to lay a foundation and create a
necessary environment for his negotiations with the central
government.

leaking of its confidential election "war book" mapping out plans
for a series of scare campaigns on health, education, crime and

<HEADLINE> Israel Develops New Technology for Improving Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli company,
SuperSoyl Lt., has developed a new technology for processing
fresh cow manure into an inert base for artificial soil mixture
(as a peat substitute) for soil improvement, according to the
Israel Export Institute.
</P>
<P>
It can also serve as a replacement for bedding in livestock
padlocks. The process is also applicable to sludge from paper
mills, by itself or together with manure.
</P>
<P>
The company calls the end product "SuperSoyl" and says it
"can be produced at a fraction of the cost of growth media
currently on the market."
</P>
<P>
Unlike other polymer-based artificial soils, it creates no
secondary waste removal problem after use as a growth
medium.
</P>
<P>
The basic system consists of a patented electric reactor, a
mixing tank, a feed pump and a solid/liquid separator. Untreated
waste products are loaded into the tank and mixed with
water. Pumped into the reactor, the mixture undergoes a process
which renders it bacteria-free and ecologically friendly. Next,
it is pumped into the solid/liquid separator.
</P>
<P>
Three configurations are available: a mobile reactor installed
on a trailer for small dairy farms; a fixed version for
continuous operation on large dairy farms and heavy duty
version, consisting of a battery of reactors, for paper mills
and very large dairy farms.
</P>
<P>
SuperSoyl can be spread with conventional farm machinery,
stockpiled, bagged or transported in bulk to end-users.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Grain Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang province, China's
largest grain production base, has taken effective measures to
increase grain production in 1997, according to a provincial
government official.
</P>
<P>
With 8.6 million hectares of cultivated land, Heilongjiang
supplies nearly 20 million tons grain to the country's grain
market annually, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Total grain production was 30.5 million tons last year, an
increase of 4.5 million tons from 1995. The increase accounted for
one third of China's increased grain production.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Heilongjiang met its grain production target for
the 1996-2000 period, four years in advance.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a steady increase in grain production, the province
plans to produce 30 million tons in a normal year, with 32.5
million tons as its goal, a two million ton increase over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to promote grain
production by increasing the planting acreage to 7.73 million
hectares. It has spread the use of agriculture techniques,
increased per unit yields, improved land contract policies, and
stabilized grain sales channels to help peasants solve the
difficulty in selling grain.

<HEADLINE> Pak Against Stopping UN Peace-keeping Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Termination of the United
Nations Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP)
"would seriously jeopardize peace and security in a volatile
region like South Asia", a Foreign Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The termination of this peace-keeping operation would also
seriously impair the UN Security Council's role in the maintenance
of peace as defined by the UN Charter, said the spokesman here
today in a press release issued at the weekly news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNMOGIP is one of the UN's oldest peace-keeping
operations and has played a useful role in monitoring cease-fire
violations along the Line of Control in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Any change in the status of the UNMOGIP can be brought about
only by a decision of the Security Council," he said. "It cannot
form part of any deal or benchmarks for UN reform."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan "has taken note of reports regarding a proposed move
by U.S. Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, to link U.S. financial support for UN
peace-keeping operations with interalia termination of the
UNMOGIP", he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Pakistani government has taken up the
matter with the United States as well as the UN secretary-general.

<HEADLINE> Short Time, Big Profit for PICC Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- PICC Life, a subsidiary of the
People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), sold 900 million
yuan-worth of life insurance policies during a 45-day nationwide sales
campaign from January 1 to February 15.
</P>
<P>
He Jiesheng, president of PICC Life, declared the success as a
milestone for her company, which aims to quadruple its total
premium income in the year 2000 compared to 1995, to reach 71
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
She said the company had 80,000 sales agents as of February 15,
in addition to 40,000 other employees.
</P>
<P>
PICC Life, reshaped into limited-liability company in 1996 from
the former life insurance department of the PICC, is the country's
largest life insurer. Its sales agent system was introduced last
year.
</P>
<P>
The insurance sales agent system was first introduced to China
by AIG (American International Group) when it started sales of
life insurance services in Shanghai years ago.
</P>
<P>
Insurance specialists say that China's life insurance market
will keep expanding in the coming years with the stable growth of
the country's economy and the rising annual income of Chinese
residents.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the competition among life insurers in China's
market will become tough, they say.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei, president of PICC, said that PICC will become an
international insurance group capable of stimulating the
development of the national insurance industry.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Imposes Anti-dumping Duties On EU, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today announced it
has imposed anti-dumping duties on manufacturers of self copy
paper from European Union (EU) and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The anti-dumping duties were imposed after final investigation
showed continued dumping of the products materially injured the
domestic industry, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said in a statement here today.
</P>
<P>
The rates of the duties imposed on the manufacturers from the
EU ranged from between four to nine percent while a rate of 23
percent is imposed on all manufacturers of self copy paper from
Indonesia, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, anti-dumping duties are not applicable on French
company, Papetries Mougeot, and two Indonesian companies, P.T.
Parisindo Pratama and P.T. Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimia, which were
found not to be dumping the products concerned into Malaysia, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The EU companies on which the anti-dumping duties were imposed
are Arjo Wiggins Carbonless Paper Int Ltd., UK (11 percent),
Copigraph S.A., France (nine percent), Stora Carbonless Paper
GmbH, Germany (seven percent), Torraspapel S.A., Spain (four
percent), and 11 percent anti-dumping duties are imposed on other
manufacturers from EU, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the Royal Customs and Excise Department will
enforce the collection of the anti-dumping duties.
</P>
<P>
"This final measure shall be effective for not more than five
years from the date the government gazettes the final
determination of the investigation, that is, April 20, 1997," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the dumping of self copy paper into
Malaysia was conducted following a joint petition lodged on August
12 last year by Gamuda Paper Industries Sdn Bhd (Private Ltd.) and
Ann Bee (M) Sdn Bhd (Private Ltd.), on behalf of the domestic
industry. They requested that anti-dumping measures be imposed on
self copy paper imported from the EU and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation initiated on August 22 following
the petition found that the domestic industry had suffered
material injury as a result of the dumping practice and
provisional anti-dumping duties, in the form of bank guarantees,
were imposed on the affected manufacturers last November.
</P>
<P>
The rates of duties imposed ranged between nine percent to 26
percent for manufacturers from EU and between 23 percent to 39
percent for those from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
After the provisional anti-dumping duties were imposed, the
second stage of investigation on the petition started, which
confirmed that dumping still continues and the domestic industry
is materially injured by the practice, it said.

NANNING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region intends to extend its highways to 47,000 km by
the turn of the century, to further the local transportation
network.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the region poured six billion yuan
into local highway construction, stretching local highways to
41,344 km.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the region invested more than 3.2 billion yuan into
local road construction, adding 1,500 km of highways and nine
bridges.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a local highway network linking with southwest
Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces, and Vietnam has been partially
constructed.
</P>
<P>
This year Guangxi will focus on the construction of highways
linking the northern and southern parts of the region, and build
5,000 km of roads in the region's west poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
More efforts in the coming years will also be placed on
building the part of the highway within Guangxi which links the
neighboring coatal city of Zhanjiang in the south with Chongqing
Municipality up in the north, in addition to the part of the
highway linking its capital city of Nanning with Hengyang in
central Hunan Province.

<HEADLINE> Manila Faces More Challenges After Exit From IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said here
today that the Philippines will face more challenges after its
graduation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in June.
</P>
<P>
The country will face more challenges as its economic
performance and credit ratings will be scrutinized more closely by
investors and international partners, the president said in a
speech marking the 100th anniversary of the Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The government will have to prove that even without the IMF's
"carrots and sticks," the Filipinos are capable of doing what
needs to be done to assure the basic stability of the Philippine
economy and financial system, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a time to relax. On the other hand, it is a time to
exercise greater vigilance in managing our financial resources in
order to assure sustained growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the country cannot afford lapses in policies,
warning that "any diminution in domestic support and in
international confidence in the quality of our economic management
will cripple the growth momentum we have gained".
</P>
<P>
The president, however, said the exit from the IMF's
supervision will also test the maturity of the country's systems
of governance in an intensively interdependent world.
</P>
<P>
The exit comes at a time when inflation and interest rates are
running lower than projected, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our fiscal position is stable. Our international reserves are
reassuring. Investor confidence in the prospects of our economy
can only be described as steadfast," he added.
</P>
<P>
The country was allowed to exit from the IMF after more than 30
years of supervision under the international organization.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President: No Common Ground Found Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- There has been no common
ground or convergence of views on the Cyprus problem between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides after six weeks of U.N.-led
proximity talks, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark Wednesday night after a marathon session
of the National Council, the top advisory body to the President
on the handling of the Cyprus problem, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.N.-led proximity talks, which started on
March 10, President Clerides said that "we began discussing some of
the fundamental aspects of the Cyprus problem and realized that
there is substantial difference between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
He said that "we have not started discussing Ghali's Set of
Ideas."
</P>
<P>
The Set of Ideas, put forward by former U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1992, includes the constitutional aspects
of a federation, security and guarantee, territorial adjustment,
displaced persons and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks, Clerides said, were concentrated on good-will
measures for the creation of a better climate between Greek
and Turkish Cypriots on the issue of sovereignty and other
issues, on which common ground has not been reached.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, President Clerides said that "today
we are discussing the Cyprus problem on the basis of a
letter by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan."
</P>
<P>
The letter, Clerides said, stresses that "High Level
Agreements (reached in 1977 and 1979 by Presidents Makarios and
Spyros Kyprianou and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
respectively), relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions as well
as the Set of Ideas and other ideas discussed so far, are on the
negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
Clerides noted that the U.N. Set of Ideas contains important
negative elements which could not lead to a lasting and viable
solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the local reports, no decisions were announced
at the end of Wednesday's National Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, the Council, comprises all political party leaders,
reaffirmed its stand that the government should continue with
the ongoing proximity talks, and it will evaluate the result
of the talks before the Greek Cypriot side enters direct talks
with Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Annan has looked forward to sponsoring a face-to-face talks
between leaders of the two communities by middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Pottery Figures Admired By Distinguished Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The recent tour of Mauritian
Premier Navin Ramgoolam to Xi'an to see the world-famous clay
figures known as the "eighth wonder of the world," brings the
number of distinguished guests who have made the trip to 100.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 million people from around the world have visited the
life-sized terracotta horses and armored warriors, located one and
a half kilometers east of the tomb of Qin Shihuang, the founder of
the Qin dynasty (221-207 BC).
</P>
<P>
The clay figures were discovered in 1974, and opened for
public display five years later.
</P>
<P>
Among the many leading figures who have visited the
historical site over the past 20 years are former US President
Ronald Reagan, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and former Japanese
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Rene Chirac, now French President, called the clay
characters "the eighth wonder in the world" during his 1978 visit
as French Prime Minister to Xi'an, which is also the point of
origin of the ancient "Silk Road."
</P>
<P>
In 1976, former Singapore Premier Lee Kuan Yew visited the
excavation tunnel after he got word of the discovery of the
terracotta figures.
</P>
<P>
Upon seeing them, he exclaimed, "These wonderful things are the
pride of Chinese nation!"
</P>
<P>
And German Prime Minister Helmut Kohl after his tour remarked,
"I admire the Chinese culture and traditions shining behind the
pottery wonders, and seeing them is an important experience for
me."
</P>
<P>
The manager of the terracotta display said that some of the
figures have been sent from China to more than 30 countries and
regions for exhibition, and the clay characters were dubbed
"Chinese cultural envoys" by foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Fueling China's Hydropower Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China has 23 hydropower projects
in operation or under construction by utilizing foreign funds
worth nearly 3.7 billion billion US dollars, with a total
generating capacity over 18.84 million kw.
</P>
<P>
"China has the richest hydropower resources in the world, with
exploitable water energy resources estimated at 376 million kwh,
ranking first in the world," said Wang Xinmao, a senior Chinese
hydropower expert, at the just-concluded World Energy Council Asia
Pacific Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the end of 1995, China had completed 13
hydropower projects with a combined generating capacity of 5.62
million kw by introducing 854 million US dollars. Another five,
with total generating capacity of 5.48 million kw and a combined
foreign investment of 1.44 billion US dollars, had gone into
partial operation.
</P>
<P>
Presently, there are still five hydropower projects under
construction with a total capacity of 8.1 million kw, which will
involve 1.396 billion US dollars in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
China has made remarkable achievements in developing its
hydropower industry over the past four decades, particularly since
the launching of the reform and opening-up drive in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The total generating capacity and the annual electricity output
have risen from 163,000 kw and 710 million kwh in 1949 to 52.17
million kw and 186.8 billion kwh, respectively in 1995. As a
result, China ranked third in hydropower generating capacity and
production in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the expert noted that much still needed to be done to
exploit China's enormous hydropower resources. By the end of 1995,
the country's total hydropower generating capacity was only 13.8
percent of the total exploitable potential, which is lower than
the world's average.
</P>
<P>
According to its medium- and long-term hydropower development
plan, China will develop add a total hydropower capacity of 70
million kw by the year 2000. By 2010, the figure will rise to 125
million kw, or 33.1 percent of the country's exploitable
hydropower resources.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that an annual installed capacity of 3.5
million kw will be added, on average, in the remaining years
of the century. And between 2000 and 2010, the annual installed
hydropower capacity will increase to five million kw.
</P>
<P>
The ever-growing hydropower industry will provide a vast market
for foreign enterprises and consortiums.

<HEADLINE> Pak Denies Engineering "Third Force" in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today denied a report
alleging that the country was engineering a "third force" to rule
Afghanistan in the event of Taliban's failure.
</P>
<P>
The report is "totally incorrect and baseless", said a Foreign
Office spokesman here today at the weekly news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been trying and is still trying to help resolve
the Afghan conflict under the auspices of the United Nations, but
it has never interfered in the Afghan internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Masood, defense minister of the ousted Afghan government,
reportedly charged recently that Pakistan was attempting to forge
a political union between former Afghan prime minister Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar and ex-communist defense minister Shahnawaz Tanai.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, the Islamic student militia, now holds more than
two thirds of the Afghan territory while the anti-Taliban alliance
led by mainly by Masood occupies the remaining one third in
northern Afghanistan.

<P>
CAIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- A trade agreement recently signed by Israel and
Turkey has paved the way for the lifting of trade barriers and
tariffs on a wide range of goods, other than agricultural
products, reported bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry officials have said that they expect
the new pact to quadruple trade between the two countries over
the next four years, saying that trade will increase to 2
billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The latest agreement marks a continuation of a considerable
turnabout by Turkey's Islamic government. When elected into office
less than a year ago, it adopted a clearly unenthusiastic
approach toward bilateral relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Yigal Hoesman, President of the Israeli Diamond
Manufacturers Association, has been holding discussions with
Jordanian businessmen over the past six months regarding the
possibility of setting up joint ventures for processing small
diamonds, reported bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
Hoesman rejected claims that the joint ventures would take
employment away from the local industry, saying that it should
be noted that the discussions are about polishing facilities
which will address the industrial sector which has not existed
in Israel for several years. These are small stones which are
not currently produced in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that the talks were initiated by Jordanian
businessmen. Hoesman accompanied Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
on his latest trip to Jordan when Hoesman met officials of
the Jordanian Investment Center.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Dutch government has approved the transfer of
funds for the continuation of the Middle East Competitive
Advantage research project, reported bi-weekly Israel Business
Today.
</P>
<P>
Holand also provided funding for the first phase of the
project which is designed to locate and define competitive
advantages in Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian autonomous
areas.
</P>
<P>
The research work is based on a model devised by Harvard
University Professor Michael Porter and is managed by Porter and
Israeli businessman Yagil Weinberg. To date, the project has
found areas of cooperation which would be of benefit to the
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The marine equipment market in the Gulf region
was expected to reach some 14 million U.S. dollars this year,
according to a press release available here today.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the Gulf market for jet boats,
personal watercraft and water sports equipment and accessories
will approach 14 million dollars in 1997, said the report by
Dubai World Trade Center which will host a Middle East
international boat show in May.
</P>
<P>
This is a consecutive 20 percent growth on average during
the past eight years, said the center based in Dubai, one of
the seven sheikdoms of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The Gulf countries every year attract many water sport
races, mainly jet ski races, and the UAE alone hosts six major
races annually. These activities have increased the market size
of marine leisure equipment in the region rapidly.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of Navy soldiers
from here has arrived in Kigoma, northwestern Tanzania for
patrolling along the coast of Lake Tanganyika against the
mounting banditry there.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper reported today that the move is one of
the government's efforts to strengthen security against armed
gangsters who were believed to come from the neighboring Zaire
and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
About 67 cases of robberies and other forms of theft occurred
between 1992 and 1996, the regional authorities said, calling for
help from the government.
</P>
<P>
Reports in the area said last week local businessmen sailing
across the lake from Burundi's capital Bujumbura were robbed of
cash and goods by an extremist Hutu faction called CNDD.
</P>
<P>
The extremists threatened to sink any ship trying to ferry
goods to Bujumbura, saying they are monitoring and supervising
sanctions imposed on the Burundi military junta last year.
</P>
<P>
The extremists were ready to sink any vessels trying to defy
their threat.
</P>
<P>
The regional Hutu extremists do not recognize the easing of
economic sanctions against Major Buyoya's government as declared
in the Arusha summit last week.

"More recently we have worked together in the search for peace
and stability in the Great Lakes region and in particular, the

He urged the two countries to continue to support the efforts
of the U.N. and the OAU in their efforts for a peaceful solution
to end conflicts in Africa.

NANNING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region intends to extend its highways to 47,000 km by
the turn of the century, to further the local transportation
network.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the region poured six billion yuan
into local highway construction, stretching local highways to
41,344 km.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the region invested more than 3.2 billion yuan into
local road construction, adding 1,500 km of highways and nine
bridges.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a local highway network linking with southwest
Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces, and Vietnam has been partially
constructed.
</P>
<P>
This year Guangxi will focus on the construction of highways
linking the northern and southern parts of the region, and build
5,000 km of roads in the region's west poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
More efforts in the coming years will also be placed on
building the part of the highway within Guangxi which links the
neighboring coatal city of Zhanjiang in the south with Chongqing
Municipality up in the north, in addition to the part of the
highway linking its capital city of Nanning with Hengyang in
central Hunan Province.

<P>
SHENZHEN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The "Konka" televisions, which
are manufactured by a Hong Kong-funded firm in south China's
Guangdong Province, has been designated as a name-brand product.
</P>
<P>
The Konka Group, set up in 1979 in Shenzhen, received the
name-brand trade mark from the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The group, a Guangdong-Hong Kong joint venture, is the
first Chinese color TV maker to meet ISO 9001 accreditation
standards.
</P>
<P>
The group, which was listed on a stock exchange in 1992, has
become one of the country's ten major overseas-funded enterprises
in terms of earning foreign exchange from exports. It now turns
out one-fifth to the country's color TV exports.
</P>
<P>
Konka group, with investments totalling four billion yuan, is
listed among the country's leading 500 enterprises and top 100
companies with the most advanced technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The group produced 2.8 million color TVs last year and earned
six billion yuan in sales, occupying nearly a 20 percent share of
the country's color TV market.
</P>
<P>
It developed more than 40 new types of color TVs annually to
cater to the various needs of customers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Konka, China now has two other name-brand
color TVs: "Panda" made in Nanjing, capital in east China's

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Supports Myanmar's Entry Into ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today Malaysia would strongly support
Myanmar's inclusion into the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) regardless of which political party runs the
government there.
</P>
<P>
He said his country's support for Myanmar's inclusion into the
regional grouping was not based on the type of government or
individuals running the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are not supporting the government or individuals, we are
just supporting the inclusion of Myanmar into ASEAN, " Mahathir
told a news conference held after he chaired a National
Information Technology Council meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the remarks while responding to reporters'
questions on Malaysia's stand on Myanmar joining ASEAN, which
presently comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would certainly make a strong stand on the
inclusion of Myanmar at the ASEAN ministerial meeting in July and
the informal ASEAN summit at the end of the year, both events to
be held here.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN foreign ministers are scheduled to meet here on May 31 to
discuss when to admit Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos into the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia, as an independent country, would behave
like one on the issue of Myanmar's entry into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about other members of ASEAN but I certainly will
make a very strong stand on this. I don't want people to tell me
whom I should have as a friend and whom should be my enemy. I
develop my own enemy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the United States decided to impose
sanctions against Myanmar by banning new U.S. investments in that
country.
</P>
<P>
To a question on why Malaysia supported sanctions against South
Africa, not sanctions against Myanmar, Mahathir said, "When we
supported sanction against South Africa, that sanction was
actually demanded by the ANC (African National Congress), the
black in South Africa themselves. They wanted the sanction as they
were prepared to pay the price for it."
</P>
<P>
But in the case of Myanmar, the Myanmar people did not invite
sanctions, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions will affect the people not the government. The
government will live in fine style if they want to. For example,
sanctions against Iraq have affected the people of Iraq and not
the government of Iraq or the leaders of Iraq. So we shouldn't do
that kind of thing to the people," Mahathir said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Copper Conglomerate Suffers From Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The copper production of the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) was expected to fall by
9,457 tons in April from an early official estimate of 27,057
tons due to a critical fuel shortage.
</P>
<P>
"The shortfall is largely on account of the shortage of heavy
fuel oil due to low supplies from Indeni (the oil company which
supplies fuel to the conglomerate)," said the ZCCM monthly
production report available here today.
</P>
<P>
The fuel crisis forced ZCCM to shut down Nkana and Mufulira
smelters in March and April. The Mufulira smelter was closed from
March 28 to April 12 and furnaces at the Nkana smelter were
switched off from March 28 to April 16.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the production of the conglomerate is projected
at 17,600 tons for April.
</P>
<P>
However, the ZCCM report did not reveal why Indeni reduced the
fuel supply.

<HEADLINE> Steel Sector Grows In First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's steel industry witnessed
steady growth in the first quarter of this year, today's "China
Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based newspaper quotes a senior official from the
Ministry of Metallurgical Industry (MMI) as saying that in the
first three months, China produced 25.43 million tons of steel, up 5.4
percent or 1.3 million tons over that of the corresponding period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The output of pig iron grew by 1.09 million tons hitting 2.65
million tons and rolled steel grew by 1.69 million tons reaching
2.208 million tons during the period.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium steel enterprises produced 1.08 million tons
more than they produced during the corresponding period last year,
accounting for 83 percent of the total increase in output.
</P>
<P>
The production and sales ratio of the top 10 steel producers
reached approximately 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the January-March period, according to the paper, the
ratio of continuous casting products, an indicator of the
industry's technical level, reached 58.27 percent, 7.12 percentage
points higher than the figure in the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
China's goal is to achieve a ratio of 80 percent by the end of
this century. During the first quarter, China produced 14.82
million tons of continuous cast billet, an increase of 2.46
million tons over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
China exported 1.72 million tons of rolled steel and steel
billets during the January-March period, a jump of 360,000 tons
over the same period last year, according to statistics released
by Chinese customs.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, China imported 2.79 million tons of
rolled steel and 50,000 tons of steel billets. This brings a net
import of 1.87 million tons, 760,000 tons less than was imported
during the corresponding period last year, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader: War Games No Threat to Gulf States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei said that the ongoing military maneuvers were neither
threat to the Persian Gulf states nor to any other
neighboring countries, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Viewing the grand Tariq al-Qods (Path to Jerusalem)
maneuvers as a threat to regional countries is a pure
American-Zionist propaganda," he was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA in a report filed here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Ali Khamenei, also Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces,
said Wednesday that the presence of Iranian armed forces in
the Persian Gulf was based on the objective of safeguarding
the borders of Iran, ensuring the country's independence and
firmly standing against any oppressive and dominating power.
</P>
<P>
"The grand Tariq al-Qods maneuvers are a demonstration of
the power of a dignified and honorable nation desiring to make
use of its strength to lead a respectable life and decisively
confront enemies and transgressors," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Khamenei made the statement while
addressing tens of thousands of forces of the Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) which have converged on the
southern port city of Bandar Abbas to take part in the
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 marines and ground forces of the IRGC and Basij
(volunteers) forces are participating in the war games which
started from Tuesday afternoon and are scheduled to end today. The
games covered 2,000 kilometers of the western and southern borders
of Iran.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 vessels, some helicopters and military fighters
are involved in the maneuvers. Surface-to-air, surface-to-sea and
surface-to-surface missiles will be tested in the games.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also lashed out at the United States for "trying
to impose their domination through every possible means in order
to spread their octopus-like tentacles extend in every nook and
corner of the world."
</P>
<P>
He stated that the arrogant powers want to impose their
presence in all sensitive and strategic regions, vital waterways
and in areas where there are abundant natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei called on the armed forces to be prepared to encounter
any transgressor and domineering power. "Iran is determined to
safeguard its independence based on divine laws and teachings and
that it will never kneel down to the enemies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and the United States have been
strained for 18 years since the two countries severed
diplomatic ties on April 7, 1980, in the wave of American
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States has pursued the dual-containment policy
against Iran and Iraq and imposed sanction and embargo on
Iran on the charges of seeking weapons of mass destruction,
sponsoring terrorism and opposing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Iran's relations with Western countries, Khamenei
stated that the western countries will become equal business
partners for Iran only when they separate themselves from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He warned western countries that if they consider themselves
as indivisible partners of the United States then they should
know that Iran will have nothing to do with them either
politically or economically.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a great mistake to assume that the Islamic
Republic of Iran would be forced to maintain its relations
with a specific group," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Securities Watchdog To Launch Risk-Prevention Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities
Regulatory Commission, the industry watchdog, will keep a tighter
rein on the securities market to effectively ward off market
hazards.
</P>
<P>
And the commission has decided to start a nationwide
risk-prevention campaign to increase the risk awareness of
investors, forge a comprehensive risk management and prevention
system and improve the ability to waylay unsound investment
decisions.
</P>
<P>
"Risk prevention has a great bearing on the stable and
sustained development of China's securities market, and is
conducive to a healthy national economy and stable society," said
the spokesman of the CSRC, while pointing out that China's
securities market is still immature and the task of risk
prevention remains difficult.
</P>
<P>
Various educational activities will be held to hammer an
awareness of risks into the minds of investors, and the commission
is also seeking to improve its market information system for a
closer supervision on the market.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance system in the stock exchanges will also be
perfected to step up the frontline supervision of the securities
market.
</P>
<P>
To build a complete risk prevention system and effectively
steer clear of risks, the commission has called on securities
regulators at all levels to focus on market supervision and risk
prevention, while tightening the grip on stock exchanges, futures
exchanges, securities companies, securities registering and
settlement companies, listed companies, brokerage agencies of all
kinds and the media.
</P>
<P>
Special funds will also be set up for the risk prevention work.
</P>
<P>
The commission also encouraged the whole society to take part
in the risk prevention campaign by actively reporting market
irregularities either to securities regulators or stock
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC will set up a special office to act as the organizer
and coordinator of the campaign, and hold inspection tours
nationwide to promote the risk prevention drive.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China has made outstanding
achievements in investment-consuming capital construction, which
manifects national strength and speed of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to recent statistics, total investment in fixed
assets was almost 2.37 trillion yuan last year, an increase of 18.2
percent from the previous year, and 134 projects were completed.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's power capacity increased by 15.25
million kw, crude oil by 19.73 million tons. Total length of its
expressway network extended by 1,117 km, and that of railways,
1,954 km, in addition to 20,000 km wavelength of optical fibre and
21.07 million sets of telephone switchboards .
</P>
<P>
Most of the investment in these projects came from both central
and local government, with some coming from overseas investors, a
Chinese official says, but the government is still the biggest
investor.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that cash inflows from abroad are still a key
factor in China's economic take-off, as the country should be
backed by massive capital construction in infrastructure and basic
industries, which have always been a bottleneck in the
economy.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Police units will be
deployed in greater numbers to curb escalating crime in Dar es
Salaam, the capital of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Regional Police Commander (RPC) Alfred Gewe said in an
interview on Tuesday that patrol squads would cover the city
center and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Numerous units would be deployed in the suburbs in a wave of
robberies.
</P>
<P>
Specific points would be placed under guard as they are
reckoned to be hideouts of hard-core criminals, according to the
RPC.
</P>
<P>
Existing police posts are not sufficiently manned for mounting
extensive patrol duties in the various suburbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcements would therefore be needed from the
centrally-placed police stations in each district, Gewe added.
</P>
<P>
An elaborate security strategy would be put into action to
ensure that crime at night was put at bay. People must be assured
of a peaceful life, the RPC emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"Police alone cannot succeed to deter criminals from pursuing
their wrongful missions. They need the help of Good Samaritans",
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Available data indicate that there are fewer incidents of
crimes in the city in comparison with the last three years, he
revealed.

However, he said, "We want to ensure that the city is as
peaceful as possibe".

BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's economically developed
provinces and municipalities have joined the country in its effort
to help poorer western parts come up to their level of development.

Leaders from better-off areas have been heading west,
responding to the central government's call last year to aid their
poor western counterparts with poverty relief projects.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Department of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
recently received six million yuan from eastern coastal Fujian
Province for aid-the-poor projects. Fujian's Putian County signed
a potato starch processing agreement this January with Ningxia's
Xiji County that involves 300 million yuan in investment. The
factory will be built to produce 60,000 tons of starch and 40,000
tons of feed annually, worth 500 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, northeast China's Liaoning Province is taking
responsibility for 676,000 needy people in 14 counties in Qinghai
Province in the northwest. Liaoning will donate materials and
technical assistance worth 43 million yuan, and will provide 1.54
million tons of grain and two million pieces of garments and
quilts over the next two years for needy Tibetan herdsmen who were
affected by a snowstorm last year.
</P>

Liaoning has also sent engineers, agronomists, teachers, and
technicians to help Qinghai improve its industrial and
agricultural production, as well as education, and management.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Makes Headway In Capital Construction (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Since 1982, China has drawn up
strategic plans for capital construction every year, encouraging
development in some sectors according to national economic and
social dvelopment needs. The government has given priority to
these capital projects and provided neccessary financial,
material, and trasportation aids.
</P>
<P>
These capital construction projects are aimed at fuelling the
country's economic growth, economists say. During the Eighth
Five-Year Plan, China put a total of 2.4 trillion yuan into
capital construction, and finished work on 700 key projects.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's economy has had double-digit growth
in the last few years and has ranked first in the world in annual
output of some major industrial products, such as coal, iron and
steel, and cement.
</P>
<P>
Technology in all the sectors of national economy has been
improved, thanks partly to overseas investment and advanced
technology, economists say.
</P>
<P>
"China will focus attention on construction of infrasturtural
projects in the coming years, as a decisive factor of its economic
growth," an official from the State Planning Committee says.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period, China will need nine trillion yuan
in investment in the state sector, which accounts for about 60
percent of the country's total in fixed assets. Priority will be
given to agriculture, energy, transpotation, petroleum,
electronics, and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, director of the State Planning Committee, says
that China will take further steps to open up and use overseas
funds for capital construction in the coming years. Chen says that
the country will continue to seek foreign government loans and
loans from international banking groups; in the meantime, it will
make use of overseas commercial loans in a gradual and steady way
in addition to encouraging direct overseas investment in
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> China's Customers Buys Home-made Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's customers are buying more
Chinese-made commodities, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based newspaper also reports that at least 90
percent of the refrigerators, washing machines and ventilators
sold in China last year were made by Chinese enterprises,
according to a survey conducted by the State Statistics Bureau,
ministries of Labour, Civil Affairs and Public Health, the
All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the People's Bank of
China.
</P>
<P>
The sample survey covered 200 million Chinese consumers in 71
major cities of the country's 30 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions. It included the sales of 40 kinds of products,
involving 12,000 brands make by Chinese and foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Of the 40 kinds of products covered in the survey, Chinese
companies have become the major suppliers of 33, dominating more
than 70 percent fo the market share in China. The survey shows
that 80 percent of the products sold in China last year were made
by Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the survey as saying that the majority of the
Chinese families expressed their willingness to buy Chinese-made
electrical appliances rather than foreign ones when it is time to
replace their present models.
</P>
<P>
Domestically made products often fetch lower prices than those
made abroad, so Chinese families buying domestic appliances can
save money and, at the same time, get a quality product. To
complete with their Chinese counterparts, some foreign companies
have also had to re-adjust their marketing strategies to
strengthen their presence in the marketplace. The paper said.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen to Reduce Land Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen City of South China's
Guangdong Province has decided to reduce this year's land supply
to 11.26 million sq m, a drop of 12.6 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
This was learned from the Third Session of the Second Shenzhen
City People's Congress which was convened recently.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the city only earned 40 million
yuan from the paid transfers of state-owned land use rights in
1996, meeting only 23.5 percent of the city's budgetary plan for
the year, and a plunge of 76.5 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials blamed land development enterprises being in
arrears with paying land use fees in the wake of a sluggish real
estate market.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen sold on the open market apartments and house
construction designs with a combined floor space of 3.25 million
sq m in 1996, including 1.87 million sq m of apartments already
completed.
</P>
<P>
The city has planned to invest 13.6 billion yuan in
constructing open market apartments this year, with the focus
going to the construction of low-cost partments. The city will
suspend the issue of permits to construct various kinds of office
buildings and training centers, and strictly control the
construction of luxury real estate development projects.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen will also try to lower construction costs of open
market flats, reduce burdens both on land developers and flats
buyers, explore new financial sources for housing to encourage
consumption in housing this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shenzhen will also step up cooperation with real
estate developers and intermediary agencies in Hong Kong, and
simplify exit and entry procedures to attract Hong Kong investors
to build flats on a cooperative basis or to buy them in Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanction Won't Affect Myanmar's Entry into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore indicated today that
the United States sanctions against Myanmar will not have direct
impact on the country's entry into the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
In response to press queries on the matter, a Singapore Foreign
Ministry spokesman reiterated that the timing of the admission of
Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar into the ASEAN depended on their
readiness to join the organization.
</P>
<P>
"They must be prepared to accede to the ASEAN economic and
non-economic agreements on admission," the spokesman said, adding
that the ASEAN foreign ministers will meet in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, on May 31 to discuss various ASEAN issues, including the
expansion of the group.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that ASEAN considers constructive
engagement as the best way to facilitate Myanmar's economic
liberalization which in turn will bring about further internal
changes.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the view that sanctions only work in cases
where the economy of a country is plugged to the global economy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced the
sanctions in Washington Tuesday, citing the Myanmar ruling junta's
repression of the pro-democracy opposition led by Aung San Suu
Kyi.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that the U.S. decision to clamp
sanctions on Myanmar is unlikely to hurt the economy which is
increasingly dependent on its Asian trading partners, as many of
the analysts believed that the U.S. sanctions would have little
bite given the small number of American companies currently doing
business in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
They said that this would only open the door further for their
Asian and European competitors.
</P>
<P>
In the region, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said Yangon's entry into
the ASEAN will not be affected by the U.S. sanction.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

NEW DELHI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- India will figure in this

representative for failing to provide adequate and effective
intellectual property rights protection, a government official
said here today.

India could be elevated to a higher "priority foreign country"

The United States, in a complaint filed with the WTO last year,
alleged that India has failed to provide patents protection for

<HEADLINE> OSCE Official Optimistic Over Treaty Revision Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Russia could reach
agreement in their talks on revising the Treaty on Reducing
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe before May 27 when the
military alliance is to hold a summit in Paris, western diplomats
here said today.
</P>
<P>
Austria's national news agency reported Negotiators from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as
saying that NATO would not only come up with measures to build
trust with Moscow, but also give up deploying nuclear weapons and
a large number of combat troops on the territories of new member
states.
</P>
<P>
But it will not commit itself to limiting its conventional
troops in Europe to the present level of 50 percent after its
enlargement into Central and Eastern Europe, as Russia demands.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which treats the revision of the treaty as one of the
preconditions for the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, insists on determining the ceiling of the
alliance's overall conventional weapons and troops through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The talks began on January 21 in Vienna and is expected to end
in July next year.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty on Reducing Conventional Armed Forces in Europe,
signed in 1990 between NATO and the defunct Warsaw Pact countries
in Paris, stipulated for a 50-50 division of conventional weapons
between east and west European countries.
</P>
<P>
NATO claims that the number of its conventional forces at
present has not actually reached 50 percent, saying it will
surpass the limit after its enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Besides, front runners for NATO membership, generally regarded
as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, demanded during the
negotiations their conventional forces and weapons be modernized.

<HEADLINE> Self-Claimed Daughter of Emperor Hirohito Cheats With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- An elderly Japanese woman who
claimed to be a daughter of the late Emperor Hirohito tried,
together with five men, to cheat foreign banks here of a sum
amounting to 1.27 trillion yen (about 9.7 billion U.S. dollars at
the current exchange rate), but ended up in court, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said a district court heard on Wednesday that the
group purportedly tried to open accounts with the banks with a
forged bank draft for the amount. But their ambitious scam failed
to take off because all the banks suspected the transaction and
made their own checks.
</P>
<P>
The banks discovered that the purported bank draft had not been
issued by the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in Tokyo and reported the
matter to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The female mastermind, 68-year-old Madam Sadako Okada, had
claimed to be the daughter of the Japanese monarch's unofficial
wife. The court convicted her last year and sentenced her to 18
months in jail. But she died in the New Changi Hospital in
Singapore two days before her release on March 13 this year.
</P>
<P>
Okada, who claimed to have inherited her fortune from the late
emperor, also wore a 16-petal chrysanthemum pin, the supposed
symbol of Emperor Hirohito, who died in early 1989.
</P>
<P>
The five men accused were facing up to 10 years in jail if they
are convicted of the crime, the reports said. They are Hsiao Li
Tung, 61, and Chao Ping Yuan, 50, from Taiwan; Seiji Shudo, 61,
and Taiji Nomura, 59, from Japan; and Heng Bah Bee, 49, from
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly said they believed the bank draft was genuine
and that Okada, whom they met by introduction, was truly a
royalty.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the prosecution, the five men, with
Okada, had tried to cheat three foreign banks based here between
January and February last year. The foreign banks involved were
the Republic National Bank of New York, American Express Bank and
the Union Bank of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
During meetings with bank officers, Okada was introduced as a
royalty to facilitate the cashing of the bank draft issued seven
years ago. But the bank officers had doubts because they wondered
why Okada did not cash the bank draft then in Japan, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
On February 27 last year, the Commercial Affairs Department of
Singapore received a tip-off on the group and rounded up Okada and
the five accused after a sting operation at one of the banks in
March.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Build First Oil Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will start to build its
first oil refinery later this year, at an estimated cost of 1.2
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The refinery, in the central province of Quang Ngai, will meet
domestic demands, media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the Dung Quat refinery will process 6.5 million
tons of domestic crude oil a year, producing products such as
liquefied gas, unleaded petrol, kerosene, aircraft fuel and
propylene, for the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the refinery will meet 65 percent of
domestic demand by the time it becomes operational in 2002, and 50
percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Petrovietnam has been authorized to conduct a feasibility study
for the construction, and the study is expected to be completed by
the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the cost of the project, which was expected
to last about five years, would come from domestic sources and the
remainder from foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign investors had promised to take part in the
project, but withdrew later as they could not meet the
government's requirements.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is still leaving open the possibility of a joint
venture with foreign partners while it goes ahead with the plan to
build the refinery by itself, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Hydro-Power Project in Nepal Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Talks between the Nepali
government and a foreign promoter over a commercial hydro-power
project have turned out a deadlock as the two sides have big
differences on issues like payments and the operation term, the
local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on the West Seti project ended Tuesday with
the government refusing to grant export license for the project,
which is to be developed by Snowy Mountain Engineering Co. of
Australia, reports quoted Nepali officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 750-megawatt project, located about 300 km west of here, is
Nepal's first export-oriented hydro-power project with an
estimated cost of over 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is also the country's first hydro-power project to be
developed totally by a foreign investor on BOT
(Build-Operate-Transfer) basis, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The project's Australian promoter expects to export all the
product of the project to neighboring India, which is facing a
widespread power supply shortage in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
However, the nearly one-week talks on the export authorization
letter for the project could not yield agreement between the two
sides on several crucial issues including the export rates,
compensation terms for delayed payments and the project's
operation term by the developer, sources said.
</P>
<P>
An official from Nepal's Water Resources Ministry said
Wednesday that the Australian company still wanted the export
license by suggesting the disagreements be listed separately for
later negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the company has threatened to withdraw from
the project if the government would not make concessions on these
issues.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks between the two sides is scheduled for
early next month, the official said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ban on Myanmar Not to Affect ASEAN: Thai Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States' ban on new
U.S. investments in Myanmar has no influence over the process of
admitting Myanmar into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Thai officials said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is entitled to impose sanctions against
Myanmar, just as ASEAN is entitled to admit it, said Saroj
Chavanaviraj, permanent secretary of the Thai Foreign Affairs
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has already committed itself to admitting Myanmar,
Cambodia and Laos at the same time, although ASEAN foreign
ministers are due to discuss the timing of the entry in Kuala
Lumpur on May 31, Saroj was quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai official believed that the U.S. ban could
affect the future economic cooperation between ASEAN and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. earlier this week announced its decision to ban new
U.S. investment in Myanmar until Myanmar makes improvement in its
human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Thai Commerce Ministry officials said
Wednesday that Myanmar has agreed to implement all economic
agreements related to ASEAN membership.
</P>
<P>
The pacts include the ASEAN free trade area (AFTA) agreement,
the framework agreement on cooperation in services, the framework
agreement on cooperation in intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also has to accept the principle of most favored nation
and support transparency in trade.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials said that the Myanmar government had submitted
its inclusion list of products whose import tariffs would be cut
below five percent within 10 years after it joins the AFTA.
However, they said that Myanmar's first list is not complete and
it will present an amended one before July when ASEAN foreign
ministers meet.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Export Slump Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export slump continued
in the first two months of this year, causing further concern
among finance and monetary officials.
</P>
<P>
The country's export growth for the first two months fell to
minus 0.3 percent from the same period of last year, as
year-on-year growth of exports in February fell 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's export sector's growth was near zero.
</P>
<P>
The figures for the sluggish export in January-February dashed
hopes of a turnaround of the Thai economy and officials fear that
they might have to significantly revise downward economic growth
predictions for 1997, which are already low.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Thai currency baht's appreciation against the
German mark and the Japanese yen, which have lowered the
competitiveness of Thai products in the two markets, monetary
officials attribute falling exports to the poorer-than-expected
performance of the commodity sector, particularly tapioca and
rubber which are mired in price slumps. Rice exports dropped even
though prices were higher.
</P>
<P>
Deputy prime minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan on
Wednesday urged the Commerce Ministry to consult with exporters
over the performance of the export sector in the first quarter and
to review all overseas orders for Thai goods.
</P>
<P>
He said measures will have to be introduced to jump start
sluggish export sectors.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic sluggishness, Amnuay said that at least

<HEADLINE> New Rules For Recruiting Sri Lankans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
formulating rules and regulations under which overseas employers
of Sri Lankan manpower will be obliged to stick to provisions of
contracts, Foreign Employment Bureau sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The prime objective of the legislation is to safeguard the
interest of the overseas contract workers including those of
domestic maids and also those of the foreign employers.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will commit the overseas employer to the
payment of salary at a specified level, provision of air tickets
and other minimum facilities, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, it will bind the recruiting agencies to supply
qualified and trained manpower.
</P>
<P>
The Employment Bureau has requested that foreign employers
should not recruit Sri Lankan labor through middlemen as this
increases the cost of manpower supply by passing on the additional
financial burden to both the employer and the contract worker.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East at the moment, the policy of the Sri Lankan
government was to target for junior and senior management levels
before they target jobs at the lower rungs, according to A.M.M.
Thasleem, director general of the Colombo-based Trans Gulf Agency.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Sri Lanka earned a total of 107 million U.S. dollars
by way of foreign exchange remittances from its overseas workers
representing a 10 percent increase over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Improvements Made at China's Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Six years ago, all a person could
see around the Jungar Coal Mines in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region was an endless sea of yellow earth.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, when you enter the coalmine area, you're likely
to see green grass and trees. How did this happen?
</P>
<P>
"What we used to worry about was whether the development of the
coal mine would cause the environment to deteriorate," said a coal
mine official, "but those worries don't exist now."
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the local government has spent 13 million yuan
(1.57 million US dollars) on protecting the mine area from soil
erosion. The efforts paid off with a forest coverage rate now of
60 percent. The local government attributed this to joint efforts
by environmental protection departments and the mine
administration.
</P>
<P>
Before any work is done on the coal mine now, environmental
protection departments make a feasibility study on impact on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Dongsheng Coalmine, a large mine in the region, has also
seen environmental improvements. Nearly 80 ha of green areas have
been built in the mine area, helping control wind and sand damage.
</P>
<P>
The Jungar and Dongsheng mines are located in the northern part
of the loess plateau, which is famous for its severe soil
erosion.

XINING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai, a
remote province with a harsh environment, has a large population
living below the poverty line with an annual per capita income of
less than 500 yuan and grain quota of less than 300 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the only relief the province could give was some
money, and when that was used up, the farmers fell back into
poverty.
</P>

In 1985, the local government began to concentrate funds and
personnel resources in helping farmers improve arable land and
other production conditions. Last year, it helped 520,000 poor
farmers.
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 80,000 ha of terraced land and 879 projects for
providing drinking water for farmers have been completed and roads
and electric power lines have been improved.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Students Over 40 Attend Universities in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of students over 40
years old has increased considerably in Costa Rican universities,
a study published today found.
</P>
<P>
At the University of Costa Rica, the most prestigious in the
country with nearly 26,000 students, 936 of the students that
registered last year, or 3.6 percent, were over 40.
</P>
<P>
The percentage is higher in other national universities.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the percentage was only 1.5 percent,
according to the study made by the National Council of University
Presidents.
</P>
<P>
National universities expect their students to be between 18-24
years of age, but now 40 percent of their students are above that
age bracket.
</P>
<P>
The study found that older people go to college to get a degree
in another field of study or do graduate work in their old major.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 percent of the students over 40 years old already
have a university degree, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that higher life expectations have
motivated many of these students to attend university lectures
again.
</P>
<P>
The study also revealed that young people are inclined to learn
sciences, such as physics, mathematics or computers, while older
students usually study arts, linguistics or teaching.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Steps in to Prop Rice Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is stepping
in with two incentives planned for local rice millers and
exporters to prop up the falling rice exports in the country.
</P>
<P>
As one of the incentives, the government will offer loans with
a five-percent interest rate for rice millers and traders who
agree to purchase at least on million tons of paddy, Thai Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan said.
</P>
<P>
As for the other incentive, the Thai government will offer
loans with a five-percent interest rate to exporters who will
export at least 500,000 tons of rice during a designated period,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today said that the measures proved to be
successful last year, so the Rice Policy Committee decided to
re-introduce them for this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Rice Exporters Association, Thailand
exported 1.04 million tons of rice in the first quarter of this
year, slumping by about 30.2 percent compared with the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's rice export value during the period posted 10.813
billion baht (about 432.5 million U.S. dollars), dropping 16.8
percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the surging price of Thai rice on
the world market to the slump.
</P>
<P>
Local rice exporters believed that Thailand's rice exports are
expected to turn better in the second quarter, hitting 410,000 to
450,000 tons per month.
</P>
<P>
The major markets for good quality rice will be China and Iran
while the Philippines is expected to buy a significant amount of
low-grade rice from Thailand, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Shougang Group reached an
agreement yesterday in Beijing with a research association to seek
additional technological back-up for its development over the next
year, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The China Research Association for Economy and Technology will
focus this year through next year on a feasibility study of
Shougang's development strategy for 2000-2010, said association
director Wu Mingyu at a signing ceremony yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It will also help the group hold technological seminars and
symposiums on metallurgical, information and real-estate industry
development.
</P>
<P>
The Shougang Group, a large state firm specializing mainly in
iron and steel production, has 28 subsidiaries in 14 provinces and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides will hold regular
exchanges. Shougang is expected to report its operations and
production to the association while the latter will make more
efforts in developing products and opening markets.
</P>
<P>
Wu said his association, a subsidiary of the Chinese
Association for Science and Technology (Cast), has set up expert
groups providing support in the fields of steel and iron,
machinery, electronics, architecture, shipping and finance --
which constitute the group's businesses.
</P>
<P>
Such co-operation marks the beginning of the linking of
campaigns between state-owned enterprises and research
institutions. These links were launched early this year by Cast,
the country's largest non-governmental organization featuring the
dissemination of scientific and technological knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Cast has called on its branches across the country and local
technological associations to help 1,000 research institutions
join with 1,000 state-owned enterprises propel technology
renovation, energy-saving and cost-cutting technology,
product-quality improvements and new-product development.
</P>
<P>
The move is a key program of Cast this year, said senior
association official Zhang Yutai.

SUCRE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The four member countries of the

<P>
The commitment is made in the Sucre Act which was signed by the

region. But the move came after other members rejected its
proposals for entering the group's common external tariff.

of Bolivia, Ernesto Samper of Colombia, Fabian Alarcon of Ecuador
and Rafael Caldera of Venezuela.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine plans to reduce its natural
gas consumption by five to seven billion cubic meters this year.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the use of gas meters will be introduced into
every household, Minister of State Affairs Anatoly Minchenko said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government will then change its way of collecting gas
fees. The present system is based on the size of the family, not
on the actual amount consumed by the family, causing tremendous
waste in this energy-starved country, Minchenko said.
</P>
<P>
He said since Ukraine does not produce gas meters, it will set
up a joint venture with a British partner.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine consumes 90 billion cubic meters of natural gas every
year, with 53 billion imported from Russia and 20 billion from
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
To lessen the energy crisis, industries of metallurgy,
chemistry, coal mining and machine-building will be among the
first required to use energy-saving technologies, he said.

<HEADLINE> Albania Force Will Stick to Relief Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The work of the multinational
"Operation Alba (Dawn)" force in Albania will be limited to escort
tasks and the distribution of relief aid, the commander of the
force said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first press conference, the Italian commander,
Lieutenant General Luciano Forlani, said the mission was to escort
and distribute relief aid provided by European governmental and
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said the multinational force would not deal with political
affairs or issues concerning the June parliamentary elections in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Forlani also stressed that his force would only deal with the
"recognized central and local authorities". He ruled out any
possible contacts with the local committees which emerged in the
south of the country during the anti-government protests in March.
</P>
<P>
Forlani said the situation in Albania was becoming better and
this would help the force carry out its mission.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1101 mandated
eight European countries to dispatch a 6,000-strong multinational
force to Albania on a three-month mission of humanitarian
relief. Since April 15, about 4,000 men of the force have been
stationed in the country.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Countries Congratulate Peru on Hostage Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUCRE, BOLIVIA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Latin American countries
today congratulated and supported Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori for ending the 126-day hostage siege in the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers here reported that the presidents of Bolivia,
Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and Panama who were at the two-day
Andean Community summit here, issued separate statements on the
crisis which ended after Peruvian troops stormed the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The troops freed 71 of the 72 hostages held by members of the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. One hostage died of a heart
attack. All members of the rebel group were killed in the assault.
</P>
<P>
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada admitted the raid
was risky, but said, "I am very happy over the result." Bolivia's
ambassador to Peru Jorge Gumucio was one of the hostages rescued
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Ernesto Perez said he was very pleased
that nearly all the hostages were released alive.  He hoped that
the resolution of the crisis would serve as an example for all
countries to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadoran President Fabrian Alarcon expressed his solidarity
with the people and president of Peru and said that terrorism in
all its forms should be eradicated throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
A report from Santiago quoted Chilean President Eduardo Frei as
saying today, "In this case, extreme measures had to be taken."
</P>
<P>
In a phone call to Fujimori, Frei also noted that uprooting
terrorism is a task that all Latin American countries must assume.
</P>
<P>
A report from Tegucigalpa quoted Honduran Foreign Minister
Delmer Urbizo Panting as saying today,"The Honduran government
feels very satisfied over the release of the 72 people held
hostage since December 17, 1996, because it was an humane act on
the part of President Fujimori."
</P>
<P>
With dialogue exhausted and after such a prolonged period of
captivity for the hostages, any solution to the crisis was to be
expected, Panting added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Peruvian president Fernando Belaunde Terry
today highlighted the success of hostage rescue, saying that Peru
had returned to tranquility with the ending of the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the fact that we hoped for an end without
bloodshed, it was not so. But one cannot ask for perfection in such
difficult circumstances as this one," he said in an interview with
a local radio station.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Looks to Hydrogen Fuel Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities have formed a
special group to stimulate research on the use of hydrogen as
fuel that could be used in place of petroleum in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Hydrogen is the most abundant element on the planet and its
combustion does not contaminate the atmosphere since it only
produces steam, Dr. Vito Quevedo, the chief of the National
Program for the Development of Sustainable Energy Sources, said
today.
</P>
<P>
The group for studying hydrogen as a renewable energy source
will collate all the work being done in the country to speed up
research, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the first stage of research, the group will seek all the
information available worldwide on the practical uses of hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
The experts will continue to investigate the use of solar
energy to produce cheap electricity in order to obtain hydrogen
through the decomposition of water.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia to Face WTO Panel over Car Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will soon face a panel
of judges at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over its national
car policy after Japan's decision last week to bring its
complaints to the organization at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Since Indonesia's national car policy was announced by the
government early last year, Japan, the United State and the
European Union have been consistently expressing their objection
to it.
</P>
<P>
Under the national car policy, domestic car-makers can enjoy
tax exemption on condition that they raise the local content ratio
in their cars up to 60 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
The tax breaks were granted solely to Pt. Timor Putra Nasional,
a company controlled by President Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo
Mandala Putra.
</P>
<P>
The company is now producing, albeit imported, the national car
called Timor.
</P>
<P>
Criticism of the car policy from Japan, the U.S. and the EU
intensified after Jakarta announced last October that Pt. Timor
Putra was allowed to import 45,000 units of the Timor car from
South Korea for a year until its factory was ready to produce this
year.
</P>
<P>
Pt. Timor Putra was exempted from paying import duties and
luxury taxes which normally add about 60 percent to the price of
other cars in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Japan's car makers have suffered heavy loses since the
implementation of Indonesia's national car policy as their
products have occupied more than 80 percent of Indonesia's auto
market.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Japan, which failed to persuade Indonesia to withdraw its
national car policy after several rounds of bilateral negotiations
since November 1996 under WTO supervision, finally asked the
Geneva-based WTO this month to form a panel to examine its dispute
with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government had hoped to avert a panel at the WTO
while remaining determined not to budge an inch from its position.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto said Monday that his country will continue
to produce the Timor car despite the fact that Japan has
officially brought its complaints to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Meordiono said Indonesia, now capable
of producing aircraft and ships, will go ahead with the national
car.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Trade and Industry Minister Tunky Ariwibowo said
that Indonesia had very strong arguments for its national car
policy, including WTO clauses related to infant industries and
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, as a developing nation, still had until the year
2000 to adjust its trade, industrial and economic policies,
including its car policy, to comply with WTO rules, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who left here for Tokyo Wednesday on a four-day
trade mission, stressed Tuesday that he was optimistic Indonesia's
national car program would be completed by 1999 when the car would
have a local parts content of 60 percent --a hurdle which allows
all autos similar tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
However, some automotive industry analysts here said that
Indonesia's chance to win at the WTO panel was slim as its
argument was "very weak" compared to Japan's.
</P>
<P>
Mari E. Pangestu, an economist, said she agreed Indonesia would
have a weak argument before a WTO panel. She recommended that
Jakarta offer compensation to Japan, the U.S. and the EU to avoid
a potentially damaging examination by a panel.
</P>
<P>
But Suhari Sargo, an automotive industry analyst, said Japan,
the EU and the U.S. would not abandon their challenge to
Indonesia's controversial car policy even if Jakarta gave them
compensation.
</P>
<P>
If Indonesia loses, countries affected by the policy may impose
penalties, including tariffs, on Indonesian products entering
their markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, there would be no immediate impact on
Indonesia's auto industry nor its economy in general.

countries should seek any special status or sole leadership, and

cooperation and promote the multipolarization process.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the two countries and peoples, while seeking
mutual development and prosperity, are willing to make
contribution to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, as two great nations in the world, are both
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and are
fully aware of their responsibilities for the international
community, Jiang said.

establishment of a new international order featuring peace,

kilometers has been finished and the remaining problems should be
solved with the help of the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that as the two countries have an equal and
cooperative relationship, it will not be difficult to solve the
problems, adding that Russia is ready to do the job within this
year in accordance with agreement reached by the two sides, on the
basis of friendly consultation, mutual understanding and respect.
</P>
<P>
During the talks Jiang expressed appreciation for Russia's "One
China" policy and Yeltsin said that his country will continue to
stick to this position.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade ties, Jiang said that he is
confident that the annual two-way trade volume will reach 20
billion U.S. dollars by the end of the century as long as both
sides fully tap their potentials.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two largest neighbors in the world
was about seven billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
As a first step in this move, the two sides should strive to
increase the figure to eight to 10 billion U.S. dollars this year,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his confidence that the development of economic
and trade ties will keep pace with the development of the
bilateral political ties.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Jiang, Yeltsin asked Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin to take measures to promote economic and trade links
and deal with existing problems.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that Russia is interested in China's experiences
in economic reforms and the two sides may expand exchanges in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Noting the forthcoming signing of a five-nation agreement on
reduction of military forces in border areas between China,
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, on Thursday, Jiang
said that the significant agreement will be a creative act in
handling Post-cold war state-to-state relations and ensuring
regional security.
</P>
<P>
"Such a concrete move embodies a brand-new sense and a
brand-new pattern of security that differs from the cold-war
mentality, and it will have a positive bearing on peace, security
and stability of the region as well as the world at large," Jiang
said.

<HEADLINE> UK's Major Appeals for Voter Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major,
boosted by the latest opinion polls of a narrowing gap with the
opposition party, appealed to voters to trust his six years of
experience in office.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to you: don't let whatever doubts you may have had
about the Conservative Party in the past weigh with you when the
future of the United Kingdom may be at stake," he told a rally in
Aberdeen, Scotland just eight days before voters cast their
ballots on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Today's Guardian newspaper showed Labor's lead had dramatically
dropped from 14 to just five points, the lowest level for Labor in
opinion polls since November 1993. Its lead has been as high as 28
points in the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ICM poll showed 33 percent of voters backed Major as the
best prime minister, compared with Labor leader Tony Blair on 32.
The gap was 13 points in Blair's favor on April 2.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the poll showed Major's tactic of focusing
on Europe was working despite splits in his own party over policy
on a single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Blair today also urged his supporters to step up
their efforts and not fall prey to complacency.
</P>
<P>
"Get rid of this Conservative government and get a Labor
government in its place. We can only do it if you are going to
come out and support us on May 1," he said at a campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
But a Gallup poll in today's Daily Telegraph put Labor 21
points ahead, an increase of five in a week.

BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A top German research and technology
advisory group today called on the Bonn government, business and
researchers to make coordinated efforts with an aim to make
Germany the Number One in Europe in applying biotechnologies.
</P>
<P>
In a special report issued today, the Committee for Research,
Technology and Innovation, which was set up by German Chancellor

</P>
<P>
The committee also urged the government to provide tax
preference in order to mobilize more risk capitals in
biotechnologies and to encourage the establishment of new
enterprises and the expansion of existing firms applying
biotechnologies.
</P>
<P>
The committee also called for improved public education and
patent protection for biotech development.

<HEADLINE> Banja Luka Airport Ready for Civil Traffic, SFOR Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The technical conditions for
civilian flights to and from the Banja Luka airport are now in
place, a Belgrade news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency Beta quoted Robert Jordan, spokesman for
Nato-led Stablization Force (SFOR), as saying that the conditions
have been restored with the financial aid of 650,000 German marks
from the British government.
</P>
<P>
The money was used to buy computer equipment and repair runway
and airport lights in the airfield, which is near Banja Luka, the
second largest city in Bosnia and the principal town in the
Republica Srpska.
</P>
<P>
But in order to resume civilian traffic, agreement must be
reached between Bosnia's two entities, the RS and the Bosnian
Federation and the International Civic Aviation Organization must
give its permission, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
Civilian flights to the Banja Luka airport have been stopped
since May 31, 1992, when the war broke out in Bosnia. At the
moment, the Sarajevo airport is the only airhub of Bosnia open for
civilian traffic.
</P>
<P>
Nato Secretary General Javier Solana, during his visit here
last week, called on Bosnian parties to open more airports to
strengthen contacts with each other as well as to improve their
traffic abroad.

<HEADLINE> Sterling Strength Hits Hard in Northern England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The performance of northern
businesses fell sharply in the first quarter of 1997, with export
sales and order slipping to their lowest level since the third
quarter of 1992, according to the latest Business Survey North.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which forms part of the British Chambers of
Commerce national quarterly report, said the damage caused to the
UK's international price competitiveness by a strong pound appears
to be hitting northern companies hard.
</P>
<P>
Based on responses from 534 companies in north-east England and
Cumbria, the survey said businesses "came down to earth with a
bump", after record performances in the fourth quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and export sales, orders, and profits recorded
substantial falls, although the survey expressed optimism for
future profits.
</P>
<P>
Export sales fell, with a sharp drop in manufacturing exports
and a marginal decline in the service sector; overall the balance
was plus 11 in the first quarter of 1997, against plus 32 in the
fourth quarter of 1996. The overall balance for 1996 was plus 25.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of business bodies such as the CBI and the BCC can see
the problem sterling is creating for UK exporters, but they are
unsure about what, if any, moves to recommend to counter it.

<HEADLINE> England, Wales Ahead of EU States in Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Crime in England and Wales has
risen at a faster rate than in any other European country during
the past decade, according to a report published today.
</P>
<P>
England and Wales are far ahead of their nearest fellow member
states in the crime boom sweeping the Continent.
</P>
<P>
An additional investigation carried out on behalf of the
European Commission found that new forms of hi-tech crime have
evolved into a thriving business rivaling the narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
The findings follow a year-long investigation by Deloitte and
Touche, the accountancy firm, which concludes that differences in
the laws of the European member states and the complete absence of
any effective judicial co-operation allow international fraud to
prosper.
</P>
<P>
England and Wales come top out of 10 countries, far ahead of
nations such as France, the Netherlands, Greece, and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Scotland has the lowest recorded increase among the 10
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the nine-year period to 1995 the number of crimes recorded
in England and Wales rose by 31 percent to 5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
Dr Roger Matthews, Reader in Criminology at Middlesex
University, said: "Particularly bad news for England and Wales is
that not only have we experienced the highest increase in recorded
crime over the nine-year period but that this increase has been
associated with an increase in violent and serious crime."

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Indicts Teenagers in Hate Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A grand jury Wednesday
indicted three Chicago white teenagers in the apparent hate crime
beating of a 13-year-old black youth.
</P>
<P>
The teens, who remain free on bond, were charged last month by
the Cook County state's attorney. When they appeared in court
Wednesday for a preliminary hearing, however, they were told
prosecutors had superseded, or replaced, the original charges with
a grand jury indictment, the United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
The three teenagers, age 18, 17 and 19, are charged with
attempted murder, aggravated battery and committing a hate crime
in a savage attack in Armour Square Park that left Lenard Clark in
a coma for days.
</P>
<P>
The teenagers will be back in court May 8th, when they are
expected to plead not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
Clark, an 8th grader, and two other boys were riding their
bicycles in the mostly white working-class enclave of Bridgeport
last month when the teens allegedly attacked Clark, shouting
racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
Clark was thrown into a cement wall, kicked and suffered brain
damage. He is undergoing therapy at the Rehabilitation Institute
of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The beating has prompted concern about racial tensions in the
South Side neighborhood and the city in general. Politicians,
activists and religious leaders have denounced the beating,
calling for greater tolerance.

The Security Council had failed twice to adopt a resolution on
ending Israeli settlement in east Jerusalem and other occupied

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today began
its debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention as Republican Bob
Dole, once a leading opponent of the treaty, expressed his support
for the convention.
</P>
<P>
The Senate will vote on several amendments called as "killer"
to the treaty by the administration before voting on the pact on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Making last attempt for the approval before the vote, U.S.
President Bill Clinton today invited his former presidential
election rival Dole to the White House.
</P>
<P>
Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Clinton, Dole, expressing
his satisfaction with clarifications agreed on by the
administration, urged the Senate to pass the convention.
</P>
<P>
"Is it perfect? No. But I believe there are now adequate
safeguards to protect American interests," Dole said.
</P>
<P>
"If I were present in the Senate, I would vote for the CWC
because of the many improvements that have been agreed to," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The event in the White House today also gathered retired
General Colin Powell and other prominent Republican figures who
support the convention.
</P>
<P>
However, when opening the Senate debate today, Jesse Helms,
Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, reiterated his
opposition to the treaty, declaring it "is worse than nothing".
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Article 10 and Article 11 of the convention
should be modified before the Senate approves the treaty, saying
the provisions would allow so-called "rogue states" to obtain
chemical weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong opposition, supporters believe that they
would get a two-thirds majority for approval of the treaty in
Thursday's vote.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which was signed in 1993 and has been ratified by
74 countries, is to take effect on April 29.

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright today urged senators to support the expansion
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
She told the Senate Armed Service Committee that the expansion
of the alliance would benefit the U.S. and ensure peace and
security in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the committee together with Defense Secretary
William Cohen, Albright said that she would visit Russia next week
to try to work out differences on a proposed agreement between
Russia and the Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
She ruled out the possibility that the alliance would make
concessions in negotiations between NATO and Russia, concerning
the deployment of combat forces and nuclear weapons on the
territories of the new members.
</P>
<P>
Russia would like the alliance to "make absolute commitments"
in the document not to deploy nuclear and conventional forces in
the new members after NATO expanded.
</P>
<P>
"But we will not compromise on this issue," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to be going to Moscow to have some additional
meetings on the subject, probably next week, because there are
elements of the agreement not decided upon," she said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin declared last week in Germany
that Moscow and Russia will sign the document on May 27 in Paris.
But Washington said later that the date for the signing is yet to
be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that she hoped the alliance will sign the
document to create a formal security cooperation mechanism with
Russia on May 27, but stressing there is still no agreement so
far.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Global Growth Continuing over Medium-Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said today global economic growth quickened during 1996
following widespread deceleration of activity in 1995, world-wide
economic expansion is to continue in 1997 and the medium term
rates at least matching those seen in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Giving this projection in its latest World Economic Outlook,
the IMF predicted that inflation would remain at its lowest level
in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The 180-nation lending institution noted the favorable global
economic conditions are underscored by the continued robust growth
performance with low inflation in the United States and the United
Kingdom, the pickup in growth in Japan in 1996, and improved
prospects for a strengthening of the recoveries in continental
Europe and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The 238-page report also said in many of dynamic emerging
market countries, there was desirable moderation of growth and
inflation in 1996, which should allow their expansions to be
sustained in the period ahead. It noted growth has picked up in
those developing countries in the Western Hemisphere that were
seriously affected by the financial crisis in Mexico in early
1995. Activity has also strengthened in the Middle East and
Africa, while the transition countries, as a group, are expected
to register positive growth in 1997 for the first time since the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF cautioned that high
unemployment and weak growth rates in Europe complicated chances
of establishing a single European currency by 1999. It said this
was creating turbulence in European markets.
</P>
<P>
The report also cautioned that the current exchange rates
between the U.S. dollars and Japanese yen appear to reflect
current economic conditions, given inflationary pressures in the
United States and slow growth in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Looking forward to 1997 and 1998 we see world output growing
at slightly above 4 percent," IMF Chief Economist Michael Mussa
told a press conference here today. "Inflation is expected to
remain at 2.5 percent, the lowest rate we have had in three
decades."
</P>
<P>
He said there while there was concern about inflation in some
countries, We don't see any significant risk at this time or any
major uptick either worldwide or in individual countries."
</P>
<P>
As usually, the report was issued ahead of the joint Spring
meetings of the IMF and the World Bank starting from this week.

UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Wang

national reconciliation was the only way out for the Somali
people.

continent was entering a new historical period of seeking peace,
stability and development.
</P>
<P>
He praised the role played by the Organization of African
Unity, the Arab League, the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development and some African countries in settlement of the Somali
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The efforts above should et support and cooperation from the
international community, including the United Nations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations, particularly this Council, has the
responsibility and ought to take measures to contribute
constructively to the settlement of the Somali question," he

<HEADLINE> EC Examines Economic Situation of EU Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC),
the European Union (EU)'s executive body, today examined the
economic situation of EU countries in the light of the Spring
economic forecasts of the Commission's services.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts were presented Wednesday in Brussels by
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, EU commissioner responsible for economic,
financial and monetary affairs.
</P>
<P>
The EC welcomed the continued progress by EU member nations
towards meeting the convergence criteria and the good prospects
for a majority of countries to be ready to participate in monetary
union from January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the improvements in GDP growth projected in the
EC's previous forecasts appear to be on track, bolstered by low
interest rates, the recent return of the dollar to more realistic
levels, strong external demand, favorable wage developments and
continued low inflation.
</P>
<P>
Stronger growth will help EU member states with their ambitious
efforts to control public finances and contribute to reducing
unemployment, which remains the first economic policy priority for
the EU, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The EC reportedly has agreed its recommendation for the broad
economic policy guidelines which will be approved by the European
Council in Amsterdam. It also agreed draft recommendations to the
Council concerning the remaining 10 countries with excessive
deficits.
</P>
<P>
The EC has recommended that the Netherlands and Finland be
removed from the list of countries with an excessive budget deficit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China and Germany launched here
today a dialogue forum to promote bilateral high-tech cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the forum began today in Bonn and will
last through Friday.
</P>
<P>
The forum, known as the Chinese-German Dialogue Forum for
High-Technology, was initiated by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulation message to the event, Chinese Premier Li
Peng said that the forum would not only boost high-tech policy
exchange between the two governments, but also provide a venue for
research institutes and enterprises from both sides to explore
high-tech cooperation projects and their commercialization.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also sent a message to the meeting, saying that the goal
of the forum is to identify concrete and commercially applicable
projects which benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the confidence that the forum will serve as a
good basis for further development of the relations between
Germany and China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, chief of China's state planning commission, heads
the Chinese delegation at the talks, while Germany is represented
by economics minister Guenter Rexrodt and research minister
Juergen Ruettgers.

<P>
According to Chinese officials, the talks in Bonn will mainly
explore possible joint projects in fields such as electronics,
coal processing, chemical production and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Germany is China's biggest trade partner in Europe. According
to statistics of the Chinese Customhouse, trade between the two
countries reached 13.17 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by German Economics Ministry said
German direct investment in China is expected to rise from the

between four and five billion marks (between 2.3 and 2.9 billion
dollars) in the coming few years.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Ambassador on Arms Control, Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Sha Zukang, Chinese
Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs, said on Wednesday that the
international community is facing both opportunities and
challenges in the field of international arms control and
disarmament under the current world situation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that as an important multilateral deliberative organ
on disarmament, the U.N. Disarmament Commission (UNDC) will be
able to make new contributions to disarmament by adapting to the
changed international situation.
</P>
<P>
On the opportunities and challenges, Ambassador Sha noted that
at present, the overall international situation continues to move
toward relaxation.
</P>
<P>
"However,"he said. "there are still many destabilizing and
uncertain elements affecting the international situation.
</P>
<P>
"It is especially noteworthy that after the end of the military
confrontation between the Eastern and Western blocs, some
countries still adhere to the Cold War thinking," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, some regions remain suffering from turbulence and
conflicts, and the situation in some hot spots is deteriorating,"
he said. "Under such circumstances, we are facing both
opportunities and challenges in the field of international arms
control and disarmament."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Sha made the remarks at the plenary meeting of the
1997 UNDC, whose main topics this year are Special Session on
Disarmament IV, nuclear-weapon-free zones and guidelines on
conventional arms control and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Sha said under the new circumstances following the
Cold War, it is obviously necessary to convene the Fourth Special
Session on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Noting the ever increasing nuclear-weapon-free zones, he
stressed the importance of formulating guiding principles for the
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zone, especially those
concerning the geographical demarcation of the zones and their
relationship with existing international law.
</P>
<P>
On conventional arms control, Ambassador Sha that the
deliberation on this item should be confined to the consolidation
of peace through conventional arms control and disarmament in
regions that have suffered from conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Hails Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan
al-Bashir reaffirmed here today that the signing of the peace
agreement between his government and four southern rebel factions
constitutes a positive solution to the 14-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Monday agreement defined a four-year transition period,
during which a coordination council composed of government
officials and representatives of the four factions will take
charge of affairs in the south.
</P>
<P>
The largest anti-government group operating in southern Sudan,
the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) didn't sign the
accord.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference today, al-Bashir said that the
devastating war in southern Sudan has given rise to numerous
economic, political and social problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, after the transition period,
citizens in the south will decide by ballot whether they will stay
in or to separate form the country.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir expressed his hope that a successful implementation
of the agreement would lead to the unity of Sudan through a
nation-wide plebiscite after the transition period.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir pointed out that the agreement faces many challenges,
including the one posed by John Garang, the leader of the SPLA.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge facing the agreement, said the president, is
the resettlement of refugees as well as the issue of
reconstruction and development.
</P>
<P>
The government is keen on implementing huge development
projects in the southern area with a view to affording job
opportunities to those who surrendered to the government after the
signing of the peace agreement, he added.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania
today stressed that the eased sanctions against Burundi are still
for only humanitarian items as it was decided during the last
Arusha summit on April 16.
</P>
<P>
Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Co-operation, Ally Mtango, told a press conference
here today that the rest of the sanctions are there to stay.
</P>
<P>
Mtango refuted press reports in a neighboring country that the
Burundian military government headed by Major Pierre Buyoya had
been authorized to enter into negotiations with the
sanctions-imposing African countries geared towards the lifting
of sanctions on the remaining items including oil products.
</P>
<P>
He said the Burundian leader's request to have the sanctions
on fuel lifted was categorically refused by the regional leaders
when they briefed him on decisions made during the summit.
</P>
<P>
"No negotiations will therefore be undertaken with individual
governments on lifting the remaining sanctions as claimed in the
article which quoted Jean Luo Ndizeye, a spokesman of the
Burundian leader," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The principal secretary further said the sanctions are
affecting not only Burundi but also Tanzania, adding that the
later loses two million U.S. Dollars per month in revenue.
</P>

"This is a very big blow. But it is the contribution of the
people of Tanzania towards solving the crisis in Burundi," he
noted.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 32 private health
facilities, including dispensaries, health centers, hospitals,
dental and medical clinics, have been registered so far under the
new guideline standards for health facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Registrar of private hospitals at the Ministry of Health,
Henock Ngonyani, told a press conference here today that the
Private Hospitals Advisory Board has to date scrutinized 44
applications.
</P>

"Out of the 44 applications, 20 have been accepted without

</P>
<P>
The ministry suspended registration of private health
facilities last November, directing all private practitioners to
re-apply for registration under the new guideline standards before
June this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngonyani, the new guideline standards are aimed
at maintaining good quality, effective and efficient health
services delivery in Tanzania mainland.

He said Tanzania mainland had a total of 1,531 private health
facilities, most of which have been operating under

The bank controls over 50 percent of the country's financial

The strike, which has paralyzed most of the bank's activities

branches offering limited service in capital Harare.

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's economy has
become the strongest in the gulf region as the Gross Domestic
Product reached 136 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Minister of National Economy and Finance Ibrahim Bin Abdul
Aziz Al-Assaf was quoted by the Saudi Press Agency as saying today
that the 1996 GDP, an 8.8 percent rise over that of 1995, puts the
country's economy at the 28th in position worldwide.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievement to a stable economic policy, the
free market economy and the appropriate conditions for local and
foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
A good performance was also reported in the balance of
payments in 1996, with a total of 186 million U.S. dollars surplus
in the current accounts, compared with a deficit of a 5.3 billion
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus was mainly due to higher oil prices in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil is Saudi Arabia's main export item. Its current
output quota assigned by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) is 8 million barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
Despite lower petrochemical prices in 1996, as well as lower
agricultural exports, the Ministry of Finance and National
Economy said 1996's overall non-oil exports rose about 2.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The oil price hike helped increase the kingdom's revenues in
1996 by 11 billion U.S. dollars, which allowed the government to
raise the budget spendings from 40 billion dollars to 51.7 billion
dollars, with an actual deficit of 4.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total imports last year declined by 1.5 percent
to 25.2 billion dollars from 1995.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Urges Moi to Continue With Peace Effort in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today implored visiting Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
to continue his efforts to bring peace to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists after holding two-hour official talks
with Moi, Mugabe said they had discussed the Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We must never tire, we must never accept 'no' for an answer
in our efforts to have them (Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko and
rebel leader Laurent Kabila) meet. Really, Zaire has a peace
program. So I have been urging President Moi not to tire," said
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations on Monday urged Mobutu and Kabila to hold
talks in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, Kabila has so far been insisting that any talks
should center on the aspect of Mobutu handing over power, while
Mobutu failed to produce a response, citing poor health.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for us to maintain a peaceful environment,
and also to do our best to bring peace to Zaire," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed bilateral relations,
cooperation and friendship which they said should continue to be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Moi, who arrived here today on his first four-day state visit
to Zimbabwe, will officially open the Zimbabwe International
Trade Fair '97 in the second city Bulawayo on Friday.

<HEADLINE> OIC Chief Upholds Arab, Islamic Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) Izzidine Laraki today
expressed the OIC's support for Arab and Islamic efforts to push
ahead the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Laraki, who arrived here on Monday, held talks today with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Palestinian cause,
Jerusalem and perils threatening the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following this meeting, Laraki said the Islamic states support
the rights of the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon and uphold the
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the peace process should be based on agreements
concluded by the Palestinians and Israelis as well as on the
Palestinian rights to establish their own state, with Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The OIC chief pointed out that his organization has adopted
several resolutions recently that are aimed at forcing Israel to
implement international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The 52-member OIC has called for Islamic countries to
reconsider ties with Israel at its March summit meeting in
Islamabad, Pakistan, in light of Israel's settlement activities
in Jerusalem, a city holy to Muslims, Christians and Jews alike.
</P>
<P>
A special OIC Jerusalem Committee held in Rabat, Morocco, also
condemned the Israeli decision to build new Jewish settlement in
disputed East Jerusalem, a move that has stalled the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The OIC believes in abidance by signed treaties and
commitment to international legitimacy taking into consideration
the fact that Israel was the primary beneficiary of the peace
process," he added.
</P>
<P>
He termed as "a great idea," the initiative by King Hassan II
of Morocco to establish a fund for supporting Jerusalem, during
the Jerusalem Committee meeting in Rabat in March.
</P>
<P>
The statutes of the fund have already been devised and it has
been agreed that the fund will be a free foundation raising money
for the sake of Jerusalem, said the OIC chief.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important step to fight Israel's Judaization
operations," he said, adding that a meeting will be held soon to
discuss the fund's program of action.
</P>
<P>
Laraki said that the OIC should be a tool to serve Islamic
causes and its members politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
Laraki arrived here Monday at the start of his four-nation
tour designed to show solidarity with the Arab and Islamic
countries' stance on the Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the first of its kind paid by Laraki since he
became new OIC chief early this year.

<HEADLINE> 32 Private Health Facilities Registered in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 32 private health
facilities, including dispensaries, health centers, hospitals,
dental and medical clinics, have been registered so far under the
new guideline standards for health facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Registrar of private hospitals at the Ministry of Health,
Henock Ngonyani, told a press conference here today that the
Private Hospitals Advisory Board has to date scrutinized 44
applications.
</P>
<P>
"Out of the 44 applications, 20 have been accepted without
conditions while 12 have been accepted but with conditions. We
never approved the other 12 applications because they never met
the guideline standards," Ngonyani said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry suspended registration of private health
facilities last November, directing all private practitioners to
re-apply for registration under the new guideline standards before
June this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngonyani, the new guideline standards are aimed
at maintaining good quality, effective and efficient health
services delivery in Tanzania mainland.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania mainland had a total of 1,531 private health
facilities, most of which have been operating under
unsatisfactory standards, raising concern of the ministry of
health.

<HEADLINE> Yang Ying, the One to Watch in Table Tennis Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Yang Ying, one of
the youngest players on the Chinese national table tennis team,
will use the oldest weapon in the Chinese arsenal to shoot at
glory in the World Table Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Yang, who plays table tennis in Chinese
traditional penhold grip, the style once branded as outdated as
the wooden tennis racket and scissor-style high jump, never
admits her style is now ineffective in the era of speed and spin.
</P>
<P>
"I will vindicate the Chinese traditional way of playing table
tennis in this championships," said Yang, who along with world
No. 1 Deng Yaping will lead the Chinese team's bid for their 12th
Corbillion Cup in the Manchester Worlds which kicks off Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Yang, the world best women penholder, said the handshaker did
have an advantage over penholder in the covering of table, but
the latter was faster and better at placement shots.
</P>
<P>
The handshake and penhold styles play as their names suggest.
A handshaker grips the racket as if he or she is shaking
someone's hand and uses one side of the racket for forehands and
the other for backhands.
</P>
<P>
Traditional penholder like world No. 4 Yang uses only one side
of the racket for both strokes and grips the racket like holding
a pen.
</P>
<P>
The handshake style allows players to attack easily with
topspins or flat shots from both wings of the table but is prone
to leave an opening in the middle of the table. The penhold
grip, on the other hand, is well suited for flat forehands and
defensive dropshots but is short on backhand power.
</P>
<P>
Unlike China's Olympic champion Liu Guoliang, who sticks
rubber onto both sides of the racket and plays topspins with
backhand, Yang is a die-hard traditionalist.
</P>
<P>
"I won't stick rubber onto the reverse side of the racket, a
heavier racket will make me difficult to handle placement shots,"
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the old style, Yang is the one to watch at the world
championships.
</P>
<P>
She is only second to Deng Yaping in the Chinese team and has
been combining with world No. 1 Deng at the women's doubles event
since Deng's longtime partner Qiao Hong retired from national
service to join a Japanese club last year.
</P>
<P>
Yang and Deng, who have swept the doubles titles at the French
Open, Swedish Open and Grand Prix Finals, are odds-on favorites
in doubles in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
Yang is expected to win a singles medal if she doesn't meet
her doubles partner in early rounds.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who has brought as much fame as shame to the player five
years her junior, seems a summit insurmountable for Yang.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who lifted the eyebrows of pundits as she upset Deng in
the 1991 national championships, has never got the better of her
teammate since.
</P>
<P>
"Yaping has stronger mentality and more experience than me,"
Yang admits.
</P>
<P>
Yang denied the idea that living in the era of Deng Yaping was
a misfortune.
</P>
<P>
"The opposite is right," she said. "I have learned a lot from
Yaping. She teaches me how to toughen my nerves and improve my
skills."

<HEADLINE> Wang Tao Chases Elusive Singles Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 23 (Xinhua) -- It may be Wang Tao's
last shot at a major singles title before his retirement and he
promises he won't let the chance slip easily this time.
</P>
<P>
"I really want to wrap up my career with a singles
championship," said the Chinese table tennis veteran, who had held
the men's world top ranking for a brief time and is currently
rated sixth.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 29, the oldest player on the Chinese lineup for the 44th
World Table Tennis Championships, has proven that he is more than
a doubles expert with impressive singles performances for a decade.
</P>
<P>
The stocky lefthander, who won the decider against Jorgen
Persson in China's 3-2 victory over Sweden in the 1995
championships team final and had also comepted in the 1993 final,
has never won a singles title in the Olympics, world championships
or World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Wang jumped to international stardom as he partnered Liu Wei to
win the mixed doubles event in the 1991 world championships, where
he also combined with Lu Lin to finish runners-up in the men's
doubles.
</P>
<P>
Wang swept the doubles and mixed doubles titles in the 1993
world championships, nine months after taking an Olympic gold
medal in doubles at Barcelona. In the 1995 championships, Wang
once again grabbed two doubles titles.
</P>
<P>
Major singles title has twice been within easy reach of Wang,
but he suqandered both chances -- the first, to lack of
motivation, and the second, to over-confidence.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Taek Soo, who had never got the advantage of
Wang, upset the Chinese in the quarter-finals at the 1995
championships.
</P>
<P>
Kim was later thrown out of the championships after his bat was
detected to have been applied with a speed-and-spin enhancing glue
banned by the International Table Tennis Federation. Wang
retained the semi-final spot to take on fellow Chinese Liu
Guoliang.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who inisisted he had lost his quarter-final match against
Kim, looked lackluster in the semi-finals and sent Liu into the
final.
</P>
<P>
In the Atlanta Olympics, Wang overcame Czech giant-killer Petr
Kobbel and Belarus' rising star Vladimir Samsonov to join Liu in
the final.
</P>
<P>
Having won most of his encounters with Liu since the 1995
championships, Wang lost his vigilance and got a battering from
the teammate nine years his junior.
</P>
<P>
"I have won most of my matches against Liu for a year, he has
never played so well," shell-shocked Wang lamented after the loss.
</P>
<P>
Playing an aggressive game close to table, Wang has been tipped
as a singles title hopeful for the last two world championships.
This time, he still is.
</P>
<P>
"Wang Tao is one of the greatest players in the world and he
has ability and mentality to be a champion," said Kim Taek Soo.
</P>
<P>
Born in a family of avid table tennis fans in Beijing, Wang
took a zigzag road to international fame. After the Beijing team
slammed the door to Wang because of his short figure, he took a
70-hour-long train journey alone to a team in Northwest China's
Xinjiang when he was 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
Wang joined the Chinese Army team several years later and now
holds a ranking of colonel.
</P>
<P>
Wang is still smart over the refusal by the Beijing team.
"They didn't want me because they thought I had no potential," he
said.

MANCHESTER, England, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Borussia Dortmund
edged Manchester United 1-0 in the second leg here Wednesday
night, reaching the European Champions' Cup soccer final with an
aggregate score of 2-0.
</P>
<P>
The German club, which won the first leg two weeks ago, has
been on defensive most of the time and scored the lone goal in a
counter-attack through striker Lars Ricken at the eighth minute.
</P>
<P>
Ricken connected a pass on the right side and made a lightning
turn-around to left-foot the ball into the far corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, which has won four Premier Leagues in the
latest five seasons and now is a runaway leader with only four
rounds to go in the league, has squandered many chances to
overcome the deficit.
</P>
<P>
French star Erik Cantona wasted an excellent chance when he,
with only one man to beat, hesitated in front of the goal. Andy
Cole, one of England's most expensive stars, also missed several
chances to level the score.
</P>
<P>
The English club has sixty percent of possession and got 14
corner shots against the rival's four.
</P>
<P>
Security had been tightened around the Old Trafford Football
Ground before two teams' supporters poured into narrow entrances
to 43,000-seat stadium.

<HEADLINE> China Ambassador on Arms Control, Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Sha Zukang, Chinese
Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs, said on Wednesday that the
international community is facing both opportunities and
challenges in the field of international arms control and
disarmament under the current world situation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that as an important multilateral deliberative organ
on disarmament, the U.N. Disarmament Commission (UNDC) will be
able to make new contributions to disarmament by adapting to the
changed international situation.
</P>
<P>
On the opportunities and challenges, Ambassador Sha noted that
at present, the overall international situation continues to move
toward relaxation.
</P>
<P>
"However,"he said. "there are still many destabilizing and
uncertain elements affecting the international situation.
</P>
<P>
"It is especially noteworthy that after the end of the military
confrontation between the Eastern and Western blocs, some
countries still adhere to the Cold War thinking," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, some regions remain suffering from turbulence and
conflicts, and the situation in some hot spots is deteriorating,"
he said. "Under such circumstances, we are facing both
opportunities and challenges in the field of international arms
control and disarmament."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Sha made the remarks at the plenary meeting of the
1997 UNDC, whose main topics this year are Special Session on
Disarmament IV, nuclear-weapon-free zones and guidelines on
conventional arms control and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Sha said under the new circumstances following the
Cold War, it is obviously necessary to convene the Fourth Special
Session on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Noting the ever increasing nuclear-weapon-free zones, he
stressed the importance of formulating guiding principles for the
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zone, especially those
concerning the geographical demarcation of the zones and their
relationship with existing international law.
</P>
<P>
On conventional arms control, Ambassador Sha that the
deliberation on this item should be confined to the consolidation
of peace through conventional arms control and disarmament in
regions that have suffered from conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Mobutu's Envoy to Arrive in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Zairean President Mobutu's
special adviser Honore Ngbanda is expected to arrive here later today
with a message for South African mediators, said an informed source.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that Ngbanda would be carrying Mobutu's reply to
President Nelson Mandela's formal invitation last week for Mobutu to
hold direct talks with rebel leader Laurent Kabila in South Africa
later this week, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Ngbanda had reportedly asked to meet South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, a leading peace broker in the Zairean
crisis, Foreign Affairs Ministry's spokesman Pieter Swanepoel
said in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's spokesman Ricky Naidoo said, however, he could not confirm
that the deputy president, who has just arrived home from the United
States, would meet Ngbanda tonight.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted Ngbanda as saying that Mobutu remained ready
for the first face-to-face talks with Kabila, whose rebel forces have
already captured more than half of Zaire and are advancing onto the
capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu's son and spokesman Nzanga said on Tuesday that his
66-year-old ailing father was willing to meet the rebel leader, but
that he could not travel to South Africa because of his poor health.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear whether Kabila would accept a new venue
for the long-awaited talks. enditem

<HEADLINE> SADC Landmine Symposium Ends in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) --Senior diplomats and defence
officials from the southern African countries today backed UN
resolutions calling for a total ban on anti-personnel mines, which
they said must be implemented urgently throughout the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
The officials from the 12 Southern African Development Community
(SADC) nations, who held a three-day smposium on landmines in harare,
agreed that those who have used and those who have supplied
anti-personnel mines which kill and injure some 2,000 people per
month worldwide, bear a joint responsibility to ensure the clearance
of these lethal weapons and the provision of adequate care to the
victims.
</P>
<P>
''Since 1,100 years will be required at the current rate to clear
the world of mines currently in the ground, parties to conflicts
should not add to this burden through new deployments of
anti-personnel mines,'' said a three-page declaration endorsed by
about 100 participants to the symposium organised by the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and sponsored by the
Organisation of African Unity and the Zimbabwe government.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20 million mines, or a fifth of those in the world,
are on southern African soil, representing a direct threat to the
health, welfare and survival of many millions of people in the region
and a major obstacle to post-conflict reconstruction and development.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICRC, the total known figure of landmines
throughout the world as at January this year was 113 million with
Egypt leading with a record 23 million mines followed by Iran with 16
million and Angola with 15 million mines.
</P>
<P>
Other countries in Africa most affected by mines are Mozambique
with three million, Zimbabwe with two million, Eritrea, Sudan,
Somalia with one million each and Ethiopia with half a million.
</P>
<P>
The participants voiced concern that landmines indiscriminately
kill and maim civilians and combatants alike and continued to do so
long after conflicts end.
</P>
<P>
They called on SADC states to launch an initiative for the
establishment of a regional zone free of anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to promote the strongest possible resolution on
anti-personnel mines at the forthcoming June summit of the OAU in
Harare. enditem

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Ethiopia Issue Joint Communique on Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Ethiopia today
reaffirmed their firm commitment to the maintenance of peace in
the common border areas, according to a Kenya News Agency report
today.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued today in Embu, northern Kenya, said
that the Ethiopian government agreed to pressurize the culprits
of the border incursion in Kenya to return all livestock,
firearms and police uniforms stolen from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The communique signed by both governments' representatives at
the end of three-day border talks noted that elders and officials
from the two countries would meet again in June this year in
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the June meeting is designed to
discuss outstanding issues pertaining to the compensation of
losses of life and property.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that more regular meetings in the event of
insecurity incidents along common border should be held due to
poor communication between border officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the issues of cattle rustling raised by the
Ethiopian delegation, the Kenyan delegation promised to
investigate and take appropriate action.
</P>
<P>
The second round of the border talks was held to discuss last
month's border attacks on Marsabit District in Kenya by armed
gangsters from the Ethiopian side.
</P>
<P>
During the attacks, about 80 people, including 17 Kenyan
security officers and 16 armed bandits, were killed when Shangilla
and Armakolle bandits attacked the area bordering Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, a Kenyan delegation visited Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, and held talks with a Ethiopian delegation on the
border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Re-conditions Progress in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Emerging intact from the
Bar-On scandal, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu today
reaffirmed that the progress on the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process was conditional on the Palestinian commitment to
combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu convened at his office a special meeting of the
Knesset (Israeli Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee
to review the current state of the peace process and Israel's
security situation.
</P>
<P>
Blaming Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat for "dragging his feet in the campaign against terrorism,"
Netanyahu said the security cooperation between Israeli and
Palestinian security forces was now at a very low and limited
level.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel was still in danger of what he termed as
terrorism, although there was no concrete warnings of new
extremist attacks at present. He stressed that unless Arafat
changed his attitude towards fighting terrorism, the peace
process could not advance.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier revealed that the United States was
formulating a new proposal on advancing the peace process, which
is based on the idea of accelerating the final-status talks. But
he did not go into details.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time Netanyahu touched on the peace
process following the Bar-On scandal, which created a crisis of
survival for him in the past week after the police recommended
indicting him for his involvement in the affair. However, the
state prosecution announced Sunday to drop the indictment against
him because of the lack of sufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
Signs have shown that the Bar-On scandal could have negative
implications on the peace process. In his comments on the
prosecution's decision Sunday evening, Netanyahu blasted the
leftist camp for launching an illegitimate campaign against him
in the Bar-On affair.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had been charged with involvement in the short-lived
appointment of former Jerusalem Mayor Roni Bar-On as the
attorney-general in January.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his resolve to continue his hardline policies,
including the building of the Har Homa settlement in East
Jerusalem, opposing the division of Jerusalem, rejecting the
establishment of a Palestinian state and refusing to return the
Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Following the Bar-On scandal for which Netanyahu was harshly
criticized by other ministers for shutting them out in the
decision-making process, he is expected to increase consultations
within the cabinet in making decisions.
</P>
<P>
This means Netanyahu has become more vulnerable to the
pressure from the hardliners within his government, thus making
it more difficult for him to make concessions to the Palestinian
side, observers said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Military Chiefs Broadly Agree on Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO's military chiefs have
achieved broad agreement Tuesday on the radical changes of NATO's
command structure designed to bring it into line with the
realities of the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
General Klaus Naumann, chairman of NATO's Military Committee,
told a news conference today, after a meeting of the chiefs of
defense staff of the 16 NATO allies with their counterparts from
NATO's 27 partner countries, that NATO's military chiefs had
achieved agreement Tuesday on most of the issues concerning
restructuring of NATO's command structure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the agreed package would move the alliance from 65
headquarters at four command levels to 20 at three levels.
</P>
<P>
According to the German general, it was also agreed at the
meeting that the current three regional commands in Europe would
be cut to two (northern and southern commands), scrapping the
current central command, based in Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said that the package would now be submitted to the North
Atlantic Council, NATO's highest decision-making body, for
approval.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the arrangement of sub-regional commands in
the southern European flank had yet to be solved.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Britain, supported by Canada, was pushing
for a package of financial and manpower limits in exchange for
losing a prestigious regional command.
</P>
<P>
In the south, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Spain and Portugal all
want a command on their territory.
 01:27CAB069i0423ql01:4201:431260
</P>
<P>
General Naumann also told reporters that NATO military chiefs
had fully agreement on the implementation of the Combined Joint
Task Forces (CJTF), including a CJTF headquarters concept and
conducting two exercises, one in autumn and the other in the
spring of 1998, to test the concept.
</P>
<P>
The CJTF concept, which was endorsed by foreign ministers from
NATO member states last June in Berlin, will enable NATO's
European nations to conduct their own operations, like
peacekeeping missions, using NATO assets.
</P>
<P>
General Naumann said that the France-US dispute concerning who
would run the Nepals-based southern command in Europe had not
been discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The post in southern Europe is traditionally held by an
American general and is demanded by France to be handed over to an
European, in order to make the European Security and Defense
Identity "more visible."
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, both NATO and the partner countries
expressed their desire to further enhance the Partnership for
Peace program and to get partner countries more involved in NATO's
planning for Partnership for Peace activities.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Arab Joint Effort to Advance Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister
Jawad Anani today stressed the importance of continuing
coordination among Arab countries to save the floundering Mideast
peace process, when recent diplomatic efforts seem to have failed.
</P>
<P>
Anani said that Arab countries should intensify their
coordination in order to protect Arab and Palestinian rights and
fight the Israeli settlement schemes.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Voice of Arab radio, Anani
stressed Jordan's refusal of "all Israeli attempts to Judaize
Jerusalem," which Israel seized in 1967 and later annexed.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to mediate between the Israelis and the
Palestinians and coordinate stands with all Arab brothers,
especially Egypt," the Jordanian official added.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan played a key role in January in a deal
on the Israeli partial redeployment in Hebron. But the situation
went worse afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat flew to the Red Sea resort of Aqaba in Jordan for
talks with the Jordanian king on restarting the stalled Mideast
peace talks. He later returned home without making any statement.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked for over a
month since Israel began construction of 6,500 homes for Jews in
disputed East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Hussein summit today came amid intensified Arab
diplomatic moves to bring the peace process back to track. Last
week Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sent his political advisor
to the U.S. for consultations with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mideast peace process has made no headway despite
all the efforts, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa noted today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri expressed
the hope that Israel "would return to the road of peace."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright announced today that she would visit Russia
next week to try to work out differences on a proposed agreement
between Russia and the Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the announcement when addressing the Senate
Armed Service Committee.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to be going to Moscow to have some additional
meetings on the subject, probably next week, because there are
elements of the agreement not decided upon," she said.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Moscow are
negotiating a document that will set up a future NATO-Russia
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin declared last week in Germany
that Moscow and Russia will sign the document on May 27 in Paris.
But Washington said later that the date for the signing is yet to
be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that she hopes the alliance will sign the
document to create a formal security cooperation mechanism with
Russia on May 27, but she stressed there is still no agreement so
far.
</P>
<P>
She did not give an exact date for her trip to Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Russian Presidents Vow to Strengthen Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin pledged today to further
strengthen the two countries' strategic coordination partnership
of equality and mutual confidence oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
During their talks in the Kremlin, the fourth official meeting
between the two leaders, Jiang said, "China's policy of
developing partnership with Russia is not a makeshift and will not
be hampered by any temporary incidence."
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to make continuous efforts together with
Russia to deepen and strengthen cooperation on both bilateral ties
and international issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
Before their talks, Yeltsin presided over a ceremony in the
Kremlin to greet Jiang, who arrived here Tuesday for a five-day
state visit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin described Jiang's visit as of historic significance and
said the two leaders will jointly make decisions on the future of
the bilateral relations for early next century.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents hailed their joint statement on the
multipolarization of the world and the establishment of a new
international order, saying it indicated their common views on the
basic trend of the post-Cold War international situation and their
identical stands on major international issues.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the Sino-Russian partnership, a new type
of state-to-state relations based on the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence, is not any kind of alliance directed at any
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are willing to develop friendly cooperation with
other countries in the world on the basis of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit, they said at their talks.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that to date, Russia has not signed any document
similar to the joint statement with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of Yeltsin's major contribution to the
establishment of the two countries' strategic coordination
partnership.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the establishment and development of the
Sino-Russian strategic coordination partnership fully conform with
the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples,
and are in line with the trend and requirements of the world
situation and international relations in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
Such a partnership, featuring equality and mutual confidence,
good-neighborliness and friendship, and mutually beneficial
cooperation, will undoubtedly facilitate the mutual development
and prosperity of the two neighbors and benefit the two peoples,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the partnership is also of far-reaching
historic significance in safeguarding independence, sovereignty,
national dignity and legitimate interests of both countries as
well as ensuring balance of world powers and setting up a new
international political and economic order of peace, stability,
fairness and rationalization, Jiang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Eight sub-Saharan African
countries will benefit from a 10.2-million-U.S.-dollar fund from
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) for Internet services.
</P>
<P>
These countries include Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Burkina
Faso, Gabon, Congo, Sao Tome and Principe and Cape Verde,
according to the Guardian today.
</P>
<P>
To benefit from the fund, countries will have to provide a
counterpart fund that is 50 percent of the UNDP amount, said
Richard Kerby, the Information Manager of the UNDP Africa
Regional Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one African countries are currently said to be linked
with Internet, but most of them including Nigeria can only access
the gateway through Foriegn Internet Service Providers, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Only South Africa, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Mauritius,
Senegal, Zambia and Zimbabwe have full internet connectivity, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Ray Akwule, a professor from the Goerge Mason University of
the United States was quoted as saying that the lack of knowledge
rather than funds and technology accounted for the
underdevelopment of Internet in Africa.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Richard Kerby said, the lack of adequate
telecommunications infrastructure and enabling policy environment
is preventing African countries from getting more international
support in development Internet Services.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Launches Mass Arrests in Oil City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The police in Warri, the oil town
in southern Nigeria, embarked on mass arrests of people along the
streets Tuesday following the kidnaping of a policeman and the
death of five persons in clashes between armed youths and police.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports today, 13 other persons critically
wounded in the shoot-out are on admission at a private hospital
in the town.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the police launched a counter-attack
apparently for self-defence against the mob since the communal
clashes broke out a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The police has confirmed the incident, saying they are
screening those arrested so that innocent persons would not
suffer. But the police did not disclose how many people have been
detained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shell Petroleum Development Company operating in
the area said its crude oil production was going on normally.
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement that the crisis in Warri
caused the shut-down of only one station and that its loss
amounted to just 2,000 barrels out of the total daily output of
950,000 barrels.

<HEADLINE> 30th Meeting of WTO Commission for Africa Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The 30th meeting of World
Tourism Organization (WTO) Regional Commission for Africa opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada
stressed the importance to create peace environment and fully use
Africa's potential to develop tourism.
</P>
<P>
He said, in 1996 while global tourism receipts reached 425
billion US dollars, Africa's share was only 8 billion US dollars,
representing only 1.8 percent of the global receipts.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, WTO Secretary General Francesco
Frangialli said in 1996 the world tourism set new records in terms
of both international tourist arrivals and tourism receipts.
</P>
<P>
He said, Africa also recorded a 7 percent increase in arrivals
in 1996 which ammounted to 20.6 million, whereas receipts rose more
steeply.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Africa received only 3.5 percent
of world tourist flows and its receipts accounted for only 1.8
percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
In her address, Chairman of the WTO Commission for Africa
Vida Yeboah pointed out that Africa's position vis-a-vis the issue
of tourism is indeed a very baffling one.
</P>
<P>
''Very simply put: we need money, and the products that we have to
offer to the international traveller are bountiful and varied= with
careful planning and packaging of the tourism offerings, most of our
countries could attract much foreign receipts from tourism, but like
in most other areas this achievement seem to elude us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
She called for peace on the continent, saying that ''let internal
and external strife and violence cease and let us build together our
respective countries and maintain our God-given natural endowments
and our hard-won heritage for the improvement of the quality of life
of our peoples now, and most especially, for posterity.''
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of Ethiopian Tourism Commission Yusuf Abdullahi
Sukkar said on the occasion that Ethiopia has now once again created
an enabling environment for the development of its tourism sector.
''Consistent with its new liberalized economic policy, it has
formulated a strategy for the sector which encourages private
foreign and domestic investment, regional autonomy, and local
participation in development."
</P>
<P>
A two-day seminar on ''safety and security for African quality
tourism" will be held during the 4-day meeting. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Gives Lassa Fever Drugs to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 23 (Xinhua) --  Chinese Ambassador Qu Wenming
on Wednesday handed over 40 cartons of Lassa fever drugs to Sierra
Leone Health Minister Mohamed Turay to help combat the growing
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese doctor working in eastern Sierra Leone was among those
who died years ago of the
disease, which is prevalent in the eastern provincial towns of
Kenema, Sebgwema and Tongo.
</P>
<P>
According to Turay, Sierra Leone requested ''emergency
assistance'' from the Chinese Red Cross for the drugs after it was
notified by an American pharmaceutical firm that it was phasing
out production of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
''It was a dilemma until China stepped in and got 120,000
tubes of ribavirini from a medical company in Shangai,'' Turay
added.
</P>
<P>
According to Director General of Medical Services Dr Sheku
Kamara, between January and March this year, about 239 cases of
Lassa fever had been treated and 35 patients died.
</P>
<P>
The disease is traced to bush rats and patients contact the
disease if they eat food contaminated by the rat's urine or with the
blood of an infected patient. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States government is
reviewing the total trade ban on elephants and elephant products
imposed by the Convention on International Trade in Endnagered
Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
At the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair held in Bulawayo
today, the country's second largest city, U.S. Ambassador to
Zimbabwe Johnie Carson said his government had no yet come up
with an official policy on the forthcoming CITES conference to be
held in Harare in June.
</P>
<P>
Some African countries are currently calling for the
downlisting of the elephant from CITES' Appendix I which bans
trade in ivory to Appendix II which allows controlled trade.
</P>
<P>
"The review exercise will definitely be over before the
conference begins in June, but this might not necessarily lead to
the change in our policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
All southern African countries now demand the resumption of
the trade of ivory and other elephant products while some western
animal rights groups are trying hard to oppose it, describing the
move as murderous.
</P>
<P>
Carson said he was still consulting with public and interest
groups on the issue.

ANKARA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said that the destiny of Turkey and northern Cyprus
were "one and the same", according to the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency report today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cyprus Flag Radio TV, Demirel pointed
out that there were two different administrations on the divided
island of Cyprus, saying that neither should claim precedence
over the other.
</P>
<P>
Any solution must be based on the realities and justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president added: "This can be achieved only by the
free will of both communities and negotiations between the two
sides on the island. The way can be opened by mutual trust and
constructive relations. A bi-zonal, bi-communal, politically equal
society with Turkey as guarantor is indispensable for a solution."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russian-made S-300 missiles should not be
BAC157CAB092I23TAQL03:0703:070799
located on the island, adding that Turkey's support for a
U.N. solution did not mean that Turkey could accept the
installation of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Demirel also gave assurances that Turkey's guaranty of Cyprus
would continue and that the security of the island was the same as
the security of any other part of Turkey, as far as Turkey was
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remains divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island to protect Turkish Cypriots in
the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed in "the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is only recognized by
Turkey.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today criticized Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila
for stopping humanitarian aid to the 100,000 Rwandan refugees in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief urged the international community to press the
rebels to meet their promises previously made to the humanitarian
agencies and allow the passage of the assistance to refugees in
need, whom he said are innocent people.
</P>
<P>
"I think, all of you are aware that assistance is being denied
to 100,000 refugees in Kissangani," Annan told reporters after
briefing the Security Council on the situation in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked and appalled by the inhumanity of those who
control this thing in Zaire to these refugees, most of whom are
innocent. I therefore appeal to the entire international community
to work with me in pressing Kabila and those who backed him in the
region, to push him to allow assistance to the refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the international community cannot stand by as
thousands of men and women and children are starving to death.
</P>
<P>
"It is obviously clear if Kabila is in charge of his forces, he
has to bring them under control. If he is not, he should take
measures to control them," he said.

CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq sent a memo to the Arab
League (AL), protesting against the sustained violation of its
airspace by the warplanes of the United States, France and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
This protest came in the memo to the Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid by Nabiel Negm, Iraqi permanent
delegate to the Cairo-based AL.
</P>
<P>
Iraq demands the three countries to make amends for the
damages they have inflicted on the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with the principle of international
responsibility, Iraq stressed its inalienable legitimate right
for compensation of material and moral damage it sustained as a
recult of this violation," said the memo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Naji al-Hadithi, editor-in-chief of the Baghdad

In parallel with the U.N. airborne blockade on Iraq after its

imposed in August 1991 the no-fly zone in southern Iraq on pretext
to protect Shiite Muslim Iraqis. Since then warplanes from the
