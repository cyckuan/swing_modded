YANKEES DEFEAT WHITE SOX, 5-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The baton carried by the New York Yankees' left
fielders was passed once more on Tuesday night, from Ricky Ledee to
Shane Spencer. What they could really use, however, is a rabbit's
foot or a four-leaf clover.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after Spencer was activated from the disabled list
after recovering from an irregular heartbeat, Ledee strained a
groin muscle while running out an infield hit. Spencer replaced
Ledee and drove home a run with a sacrifice fly as the Yankees
edged the White Sox, 5-3, for their seventh consecutive victory.
Orlando Hernandez (12-6) pitched six innings before departing with
an apparent minor injury.
</P>
<P>
   As Hernandez warmed up to pitch the bottom of the sixth inning,
he had a problem that prompted Manager Joe Torre and the trainer
Gene Monahan to go to the mound. Hernandez chatted amiably with
Torre and persuaded his manager to leave him in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But after Hernandez pitched the sixth inning, he was relieved by
the left-hander Allen Watson, despite the fact that Hernandez had
thrown only 71 pitches, or about 40 fewer than normal. The Yankees
announced that Hernandez, who has a history of back trouble, hadn't
suffered any injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about my next start,'' Hernandez said afterward.
``In five days, El Duque.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson pitched into the eighth, permitting consecutive singles
with one out and the Yankees leading by 4-2. The right-hander Jason
Grimsley relieved Watson and prompted Frank Thomas to bounce to
third for what should have been an easy double play.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius threw to second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who
failed to catch the ball. One run scored, the potential tying run
moved to third and there was still one out. But Magglio Ordonez
broke his bat on a soft lineout to short for the second out.
Grimsley then stunned Paul Konerko with a slider for an
inning-ending strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday night's game, the Yankees' left fielders had
a cumulative batting average of .210, with 12 homers and 32 runs
batted in, meager numbers but a vast improvement from June. Since
then, Spencer and then Chad Curtis and Ledee all got hot
intermittently. Torre indicated before Tuesday night's game that
even if the Yankees did not make a trade for a left fielder, he was
sure that Ledee, Spencer and Curtis could get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't stay healthy. Ledee chopped a ground ball to the
left side of the infield in the second inning and after he lunged
to safely reach first, he grabbed his upper thigh before limping
off. The Yankees announced that Ledee had suffered a slight groin
strain, but Torre usually treats injuries conservatively.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer singled and scored a run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and nobody on base, Paul O'Neill pulled the ball
down the right-field line. But the ball curled foul at the pole,
prompting O'Neill to stare down the line, squinting to see if the
ball should have been ruled fair.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill returned and smashed a high drive to right-center field,
where fans in the stands waited for the ball to land. Chris
Singleton had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox center fielder leaped at the wall to backhand
O'Neill's shot before falling to the ground. O'Neill, by his
standards, watched passively.
</P>
<P>
   Having just missed a home run before being robbed of another,
O'Neill started the Yankees' fourth-inning rally with a double,
flaring the ball down the left field line. Bernie Williams slammed
a single to right field, but the ball hit hard enough to force
O'Neill to stop at third. O'Neill scored when Tino Martinez dumped
a single in front of Singleton to put the Yankees ahead, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   When Chili Davis hit a fly to straightaway center field, the
deepest part of the field, Williams tagged up and took third as
Martinez tagged up at first and raced for second. After Singleton
made a strong throw toward second, shortstop Mike Caruso
inexplicably cut off the ball rather than allow Ray Durham attempt
a tag on Martinez. &QL;

SHUTTLE MAKES PINPOINT LANDING AFTER TELESCOPE DELIVERY MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BETH DICKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The first woman to command a U.S. space mission
returned to Earth in the space shuttle Columbia late Tuesday,
capping a smooth, five-day mission to deliver a telescope by making
a pinpoint landing in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Blazing a fiery trail in the night sky over the Gulf of Mexico,
the winged spaceship, with Col. Eileen M. Collins of the Air Force
at the controls, touched down at 11:20 p.m., Eastern time at the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida not far from where it was launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbia home, completing a mission that made history and
opened a new eye on the universe,'' said James Hartsfield, a
commentator at Mission Control here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston, Columbia. Wheels stopped,'' Colonel Collins, 42,
radioed from the cockpit as the 100-ton spaceship rolled to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome home,'' Mission Control's Scott Altman radioed back.
``Eileen, to you and the crew, just an outstanding job deploying
Chandra and bringing Columbia home for a beautiful landing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy Space Center, rocket engineers were standing by
to investigate a more down-to-earth mystery, why the Columbia
apparently leaked explosive hydrogen fuel from the moment it was
launched all the way into orbit early last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials characterized the leak as small. But a larger
leak could have caused the engine to shut down early, forcing the
crew to attempt a risky emergency landing in Florida or across the
Atlantic in Africa minutes after liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the mission saw the crew of two women and three
men deploy NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory, a $1.5 billion space
telescope designed to help solve the mysteries of black holes and
other intriguing astronomical objects.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Colonel Collins aboard the Columbia were the mission
pilot, Capt. Jeffrey S. Ashby, 45, of the Navy, and three mission
specialists: Lt. Col. Catherine G. Coleman, 38, of the Air Force, a
polymer chemist; Steven A. Hawley, 47, an astronomer, and Col.
Michel Tognini, 49, of the French Air Force.

EDITORIAL: ONE MORE CHANCE FOR PATIENTS' RIGHTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs last graf for clarifying rewrite)  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   The fight for strong legislation to protect the rights of
patients in managed-care health plans has now moved to the House.
The House Republican leadership will make a serious mistake if it
insists on replicating the Senate's feeble efforts. Americans are
plainly worried about managed-care abuses. A number of dissident
Republicans have heard these concerns and are pushing for tougher
patient protections, including the right to sue health plans when
they improperly deny coverage. The issue is whether these
Republicans can get their leaders to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Any meaningful legislation has to cover all 161 million
Americans with private health insurance. It should require that
appeals of denials of coverage be heard by an independent panel
with broad powers of review. The bill should prohibit health plans
from dodging this process by defining ``medical necessity'' in
unfairly narrow ways. It should also contain a strong enforcement
mechanism so that consumers who are injured by wrongful denials of
care can get legal redress.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law bars the roughly 125 million people covered
by private employer-sponsored insurance from suing a health plan
for damages caused by improper coverage denials. Without the right
to sue, there is no meaningful deterrent against abuses. Critics
predict a flood of litigation and a rise in premiums. But studies
of groups that are not barred from suing _ notably state and local
employees _ have found that litigation has been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The House leadership opposes the right to sue, and has
tentatively decided to offer a version of the Senate bill, probably
modified to cover more people. But even that change would not be
sufficient. The Clinton administration has signaled that it will
veto an inadequate measure. The House Republicans need political
cover on this issue, but passing a sham bill will not protect them
from angry voters.

SHOWING CONCERN FOR HEAT MEANS A LOT TO OLDER RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD AND RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvey Brown set down a white box fan and knocked on Mary
Grizzle's door. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, four days into the heat wave that's hunkered on top
of Kansas City, Grizzle's 19-year-old air-conditioner gave out.
That left the 67-year-old homebound Kansas Citian with little
choice but to sweat out the temperatures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To sleep at night, she covered herself in towels soaked in ice
water. Still, that hasn't been a very safe, or comfortable,
solution for Grizzle, who has high blood pressure, severe arthritis
and diabetes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday afternoon, Grizzle was grateful not only for the
Meals on Wheels delivery from the Don Bosco Community Center, but
also for the white box fan as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just on the phone to church, asking people to pray for
those who don't have air conditioning,'' she said. ``And look,
already you've brought me a fan. God bless you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During what some are calling Kansas City's worst heat wave in a
decade, Brown and other service workers like him are being hailed
as quiet heroes. During sweltering summer weather, Brown and others
serve a vital role: to make sure those people most at risk for
heat-related health problems _ the elderly, disabled or ill _ are
coping with the heat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, a 65-year-old man died July 8, and a day later,
an 81-year-old Lee's Summit, Mo., woman died, both of heat-related
illnesses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around Kansas City, Tuesday marked the 10th day on which
temperatures have soared past 90 degrees. Downtown Kansas City
recorded 100 degrees, with a heat index of 110 degrees. At Kansas
City International Airport, the high was 99. An Ozone Red Alert was
also in place and planned for today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No other heat-related deaths were reported Tuesday, although
area hospitals reported having treated more than 30 people in the
past week for heat-related problems, from dehydration to heat
exhaustion. One person at Baptist Medical Center in Kansas City
remained in critical condition Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement and public safety agencies Tuesday throughout
the Northland said that despite searing temperatures, there were
virtually no heat-related calls. Dispatchers for the Excelsior
Springs Police Department said police and fire officials responded
to two calls of people overheating, but both persons were quickly
treated without further incident. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These sun-drenched, sizzling days will continue into the
weekend, according to the National Weather Service in Pleasant
Hill, Mo. A high-pressure system is stifling the area with
sweltering temperatures while fending off cold fronts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Any showers in northern Missouri or along the Kansas-Nebraska
border will provide little comfort for the metro area, said
meteorologist Janice Bunting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Utilities that have watched soaring power consumption reported
no problems meeting the demand Tuesday, but continued to ask that
residents help conserve electricity by setting thermostats to
higher levels and avoiding high-consumption activities, such as
doing laundry, during the hottest part of the day, generally from 2
p.m. to 8 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pam Levetzow, a spokeswoman for Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co.,
said older residents and people with health problems should not
attempt any power reductions that could prove harmful. Simply
turning off extra lights or not using a dishwasher during peak
demand could help, without resulting in health risks, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, cities _ and their water supplies _ are coping well,
despite threats of breaks as pipes buckle in the shifting earth.
Several area water departments reported high-level consumption;
Johnson Countians smashed a previous record on Sunday night. None
of the water departments, however, plans conservation measures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Countians easily topped their previous water consumption
record on Sunday night, when Water District No. 1 poured 122
million gallons into its service area. That amount was far greater
than the previous record of 117 million gallons, but well below the
165-million-gallon capacity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Independence, Mo., which supplies water for parts of Blue
Springs, Mo., and Lee's Summit, Mo., the water department pumped
37.9 million gallons on Sunday, close to the 38.1 million gallon
record set July 4, 1997. Independence, Mo. is rated to pump 42
million gallons daily. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Kansas City's water department can produce about 240
million gallons of water a day, the summer average is about 160
million gallons. Last week, the city average exceeded 170 million
gallons. On Tuesday, that surged to about 185 million gallons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problems are the greatest for older residents, said Jon
Dedon, a Truman Medical Center geriatrician internist who also
teaches at University of Missouri-Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The organs of older people, Dedon said, are less able to divert
blood to the skin to cool the body while still maintaining a
healthy blood pressure and pulse. Often, senior citizens don't
realize when they are thirsty, Dedon said. Seniors with dementia
can't plan for the heat; they might not turn on their air
conditioner even if they have one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During hot times, medicinal treatments for the elderly also can
be a curse. Diuretic medicines are often used, for example for
treating heart disease and blood pressure, but they can cause
dehydration during the summertime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daily visits _ whether from a neighbor, a family member, or a
delivery man _ can often make the difference isolated senior
citizens need to stay alive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the eyes and ears for seniors who live alone,'' said
Bobbie Proctor, the home services supervisor for the Neighborhood
Family Project, a nonprofit which serves elderly residents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Don Bosco's Brown stopped to check on
85-year-old Zelma Hubbard, he noticed that the thermometer in her
front sun room registered 100 degrees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In her living room, the temperature seemed to be at least that.
Hubbard was seated between two fans. The windows were locked shut,
because she said she lacks the strength to open them on her own and
because she fears leaving her home exposed to burglars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awfully hot,'' she noted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any way to cool off besides these fans?'' Brown
asked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I do have an air conditioner. But I have to wait until
the girl who stays with me in the afternoons gets here to turn it
on.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's in the basement.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a minute and I can get that for you.'' &QL;

WORKERS ENCOUNTER SECOND GAS SCARE AT FIRE SITE 
</HEADLINE>
 FIRE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN HOFFMAN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As utility and fire officials investigated a suspected gas leak
and explosion that occurred Monday night near 41st and Walnut
streets, a second leak Tuesday sent a scare through the
neighborhood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A pile of bricks and burnt rubble was all that remained of the
corner building of the Weaver Apartments, where more than a dozen
residents had fled their homes to safety about 20 hours earlier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m. Tuesday, the area had begun to settle down. Only three
police officers, a few representatives of the Salvation Army and a
handful of utility workers remained at the scene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then they detected a hissing noise and the strong odor of
natural gas, which sent members of the utility crew slowly backing
away. A police officer used his public address system to tell
people to get back. Television news trucks a block away were
evacuated. Fire pumpers quickly arrived and police began roping off
the area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Crockett, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy, said
contractors for Southwestern Bell were trying to restore service to
parts of the area and struck a gas main. He said about 30 to 40
persons were evacuated from a three-block area. They were allowed
to return about 6:30 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Valerie McGriff was home Tuesday with her husband, Don, at 19 E.
41st St. when a firefighter knocked on their door and told them to
leave. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up the cat and packed some baggage,'' said McGriff,
who said she could smell the natural gas blowing into her home.
``When he came to the door, I knew.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they dealt with the disruption of a second evacuation within
24 hours, some residents expressed dismay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pathetic. It just happened last night,'' said
Jennie Richards, who lives around the corner on Walnut. ``They
should have better control.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crockett said Tuesday that Missouri Gas officials still were
investigating the explosion. He said workers had been called to the
apartments about 6:30 p.m. Monday for a reported gas leak. Two
workers had been in the basement just before the explosion. A third
had been in a truck parked along 41st Street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The workers in the basement suffered burns on their faces and
throats and were being treated at a hospital. One was in critical
condition Tuesday night, and one was in fair condition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing much better, and their injuries are not
life-threatening,'' said Darrek Porter, vice president of public
affairs for the gas company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri regulators said Tuesday that Missouri Gas officials
told them the main gas pipe and the pipe to the apartment building
had been replaced with plastic pipe in October. The replacements
were part of a program by the utility to replace old pipe in the
utility's service territory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Case, a maintenance worker for the apartments, said he
had been called to the scene for the gas leak. Initially, he said,
the gas crew told him that everything was under control. He said he
went outside the building and stood on Walnut talking to a woman
who lived in a basement apartment. A moment later, he was jolted by
the blast and showered with flying glass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me and blew my glasses off,'' Case said. ``I still
haven't found them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Case said he helped a resident with a child as others tended to
the woman he had been talking to. Neighbors used a door that had
blown off its hinges to carry the woman away from the burning
building. She remained in the hospital Tuesday with a possible
concussion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as he helped secure vacated apartments, Case thought
about how lucky he was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing I wasn't in front of the building, or I
would be dead,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jenni Carlson, a sports columnist for The Kansas City Star who
lived in the apartment building, said all residents of the
eight-unit building and the two adjacent buildings were fortunate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My thought is that if I was in the kitchen, I wouldn't have
been so lucky,'' Carlson said. ``There were 14 people who had to be
in a good spot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carlson said she was sitting on her couch of her second-floor
apartment, looking over some bills, when the blast rocked her. She
said it seemed to have come from her left and below her. She ran to
the front door, and there she noticed the first real sign of the
devastation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see down into the stairwell so the wall behind my
couch had blown out,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unable to open her door, Carlson ran to a sliding door to her
balcony and threw a potted plant through the glass. She used the
plant's stand to clear away shards of glass and made it out to the
deck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled for help several times,'' she said. ``A man (on the
ground) said, `You need to jump! `You need to jump!' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of jumping was not inviting, nor was the idea of
crawling down a nearby drain pipe. Carlson decided to get down by
climbing over her porch railing, hanging from her patio floor and
dropping to the porch below. Her plan didn't work; instead, she
fell about 15 to 20 feet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her left foot and hand were cut, requiring 12 stitches, and her
left arm was badly bruised. &QL;

GRAVES RELUCTANTLY OPTS FOR FEDERAL REFORMULATED GASOLINE PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With some reluctance, Kansas Gov. Bill Graves announced Tuesday
that he will ask for federal permission to bring reformulated
gasoline to the Kansas City metro area to reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement virtually assures that millions of dollars in
highway construction _ including the Chouteau Bridge project in
Missouri and $250 million in projects in Johnson and Wyandotte
counties _ can proceed without delays.
</P>
<P>
   Graves' announcement to join the federal reformulated gasoline
program came only hours after Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Carol Browner called for a significant reduction in
the use of MTBE, the most popular additive in reformulated
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``...We must begin to significantly reduce the use of MTBE in
gasoline as quickly as possible without sacrificing the gains we've
made in achieving cleaner air,'' Browner said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials are concerned about MTBEs potential to contaminate
ground water.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan was expected to announce
today that he also would ask the EPA to include the Kansas City
metro area in the federal reformulated gasoline program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason to believe that there's any reservation on
Carnahan's part (in making the request),'' said Mell Henderson,
transportation director at the Mid-America Regional Council.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's chief of staff, Chris Sifford, said that Carnahan
would make an announcement soon. ``We're still looking and
analyzing our options,'' Sifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Browner's announcement didn't trouble Carnahan, Sifford said.
``We think if we opt into the program, the EPA will update the
program to address the environmental concerns associated with
MTBE.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves and Carnahan had considered today as the last in which
they could decide to opt into the program and ensure no delays in
highway construction.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, federal highway officials and the EPA decided
that area transportation plans were out of compliance with clean
air rules. To fix it, transportation officials said the governors
would have to ask the EPA to use reformulated gasoline in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least a year before reformulated gasoline is be
available at area pumps, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Graves was thought to be the least likely of the two governors
to join the federal program. He and his staff had expressed
concerns about the reformulated gasoline program, including
lawsuits and water pollution problems resulting from the increased
use of reformulated gasoline nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Graves expressed reluctance Tuesday in joining the
federal program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our staff worked diligently to explore more palatable options,
acceptable to consumers and Kansas-based refiners,'' Graves said.
``Our hope was to choose an option which did not require the
introduction of this potential source of ground water pollution,
but the timeframe established by EPA and the Federal Highway
Administration made that impractical.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves' concerns were echoed in Washington when Browner
announced Tuesday that the EPA _ which has long promoted the fuel
to reduce air pollution _ should try to phase out the fuel
additive. She said the EPA had never intended to sacrifice clean
water to produce clean air.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, including Missouri, MTBE has contaminated
drinking water supplies as it has leaked from underground storage
tanks, pipes and even into lakes from boat engines. California has
already announced a ban on the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In changing course, Browner cited a report by an EPA advisory
panel, the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates and Gasoline. The panel
called for a host of new actions to protect the nation's water
supplies from MTBE and other fuel additives. It also recommended
Congress remove the federal requirement for oxygen-adding
chemicals, including MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended that MTBE, currently used in 85 percent of
reformulated gasoline, be phased out. In 2004, other regulations
will require reductions in sulfur and other pollutants in gasoline.
The result should be an alternative to reformulated gasoline that
provides similar air quality benefits.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE's promoters, including the Oxygenated Fuels Association,
expressed concerns about the Blue Ribbon panel's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not restrict the availability of oxygenates before we
have ensured that non-oxygenated cleaner-burning fuels can really
produce the needed air quality benefits generated so readily by
fuels that use oxygenates,'' said Terry Wigglesworth, executive
director of the association.
</P>
<P>
   Some local and state officials also worried Tuesday that
switching from MTBE to some other alternative fuel may take time
and cause delays in Kansas City's efforts to improve air quality.
</P>
<P>
   But EPA officials in the agency's regional offices in Kansas
City, Kan., said that Graves' decision on reformulated gasoline
should have long-reaching, positive impacts for the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be good for air quality in Kansas City,''
said the EPA's Royan Teter.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of
Natural Resources, said the agency is pleased with the action the
EPA is taking and doesn't expect any delays in bringing the
reformulated gasoline to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson added that the Department of Natural Resources has
upgraded nearly all underground storage tanks in Missouri to
prevent leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we actually get reformulated gasoline to Kansas
City, there's going to be alternatives available,'' Thompson said.

SPOKANE NOW KNOWS WHAT'S WRONG, BUT NOT SURE HOW TO REPAIR IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 31, Forbes magazine ranked Seattle No. 1 out of 162
cities in the United States for business and careers. The magazine
ranked Spokane, Wash., 161st, ahead of only Johnson City, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   This created hardly a stir in Seattle. Spokane noticed. The
leaders of the state's second-largest city were irritated at being
ranked with a town in the Appalachians near the birthplace of Davy
Crockett. They were even more irritated at yet another disparaging
comparison with Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Tom Matthews, chairman of Avista Corp., holding
company for the former Washington Water Power Co. Matthews said
June 10 he might move Avista's four unregulated businesses out of
Spokane. He was having trouble attracting talent. Avista had
interviewed 100 people nationwide for $80,000-to-$100,000 a year
jobs, and none would move to Spokane. Many worried about finding
jobs for their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Avista is also supporting 66 students on scholarships at local
colleges. ``Not one of them plans to go to work here,'' Matthews
said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews moved to Spokane a year ago from Houston. Blunt talk
from an out-of-town guy was taken by some as negative. But he says,
``The general reaction was, `We've all thought it; now at least
Matthews is willing to stand up and say it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spokane does not lack for jobs. But the average household earns
almost $15,000 less in Spokane County than in King County, where
Seattle is. The average house, according to Windermere Real Estate,
also sells for about half: $130,000 in Spokane vs. $264,000 in
northwest Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Spokane held an economic forum in which Ross DeVol,
an analyst with the Milken Institute in Santa Monica, Calif., said
Spokane's problem is technology companies: It doesn't have enough
of them. ``My sense is that the public sector doesn't understand
how important technology industries are,'' DeVol says.
</P>
<P>
   The June 30 forum, the first of several planned, wasn't
organized by downtown business leaders. ``We didn't want this first
one called by the existing leadership because we have to take a new
direction,'' said John Stone, president of John Stone Development.
He quickly added, ``We are not going to exclude anybody, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers said Spokane had focused too much on downtown
retail. ``It was fascinating to see Nordstrom being built downtown,
and people touting it,'' DeVol says. ``Everybody likes to have a
Nordstrom. But economic development through retail is a zero-sum
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokane leaders tread delicately on the Nordstrom issue: It is a
done deal. Controversy swirls over the proposed convention center
project, another example of downtown-first priorities. ``I could
argue with that myself,'' Matthews says. ``But the money's there,
the time's right, so let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The message of the conference is that the future priorities
should be different, that Spokane needs to train a high-tech
workforce and recruit and grow the companies to employ them.
</P>
<P>
   The city has no research university comparable to the University
of Washington in Seattle. It does have Gonzaga, Whitworth and
Eastern Washington universities and a branch of Washington State
University, and a will to make the most of these assets. Gonzaga
and WSU will begin a joint program in computer engineering this
fall. Father Robert Spitzer, Gonzaga's president, says, ``We're
going to try to do the same thing in manufacturing engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   But he adds, ``We've got to have jobs that will attract very
bright students to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   One of DeVol's ideas is that Spokane build up a cluster of
test-and-measurement companies, some of which it already has. The
existing employers, however, are not interested in recruiting
rivals to hire away their workers, says Rich Hadley, president of
the Spokane Area Chamber of Commerce. Yet it is in the workers'
interest _ and the employers' long-run interest _ that other
companies come, wages get bid up, and workers learn the new
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Spokane has tried more than parking garages. Partly because of
pressure from former House Speaker Tom Foley, The Boeing Co. opened
an operation in Spokane a decade ago. Others have opened offices in
Spokane. The problem, says John Stone, is ``they don't grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokane needs something that will grow, and that pays well.
Otherwise people will leave town or do their work out of town, as
Stone does. He just built a 155-unit mixed-use project, the Allegro
One and Two, in Seattle's University District. ``Seattle's the hot
market,'' he says. ``You go where the activity is.''
</P>
<P>
   He ponders his hometown. ``It needs to change here,'' he says.

SOX WIN A WILD ONE
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-TORONTO-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ This is how Butch Huskey, the hulking Red Sox newcomer
who uses up more bolts of cloth for one uniform than newly promoted
second baseman Donnie Sadler requires for his entire wardrobe,
sized up his new team, even before Tuesday night's 11-9
come-from-behind win against the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to fight, and I'm here to fight with 'em,'' said
the 6-foot-4-inch Huskey, who is built like an NBA small forward
but had three hits as DH in his Sox debut Tuesday night, including
a phantom home run that was ruled a single in the Sox' six-run
fifth inning. ``We're all in this together now.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskey, who took his place at the back of the Sox conga line to
exchange high-fives with his new teammates after the game, had no
reason to alter his view after the Sox rallied from a 7-3 deficit
to overtake the Blue Jays, who were nine games under .500 on June
12, but had won 29 of their next 39 games to overtake the Sox in
the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit, we hit,'' he said after the Sox, playing their 100th
game of the season, pulled to within a half-game of the Blue Jays
in the wild-card pecking order by amassing 18 hits, including three
apiece by Darren Lewis and Nomar Garciaparra. ``They scored, we
scored. Coming to the end, there are going to be games like that.
Those are the ones that hopefully we're going to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that has the ability to scrap and fight. I saw,
even from the other side, that they have the players and the
chemistry to come back and win ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with reinforcements in Huskey and Sadler, who was Jimy
Williams's telling choice to start at second base instead of
All-Star Jose Offerman, this was hardly an optimum time for the Sox
to be engaged in a border skirmish with the Blue Jays, who had won
a league-leading 17 games this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, losers of four of their previous five games, also
seemed stuck in self-destruct mode, squandering a first-inning
rally when third-base coach Wendell Kim sent John Valentin on a
ridiculous dash to the plate with no outs, then blowing a 3-0 lead
in the bottom of the second, when the Blue Jays exploited a
throwing error by second baseman Sadler to score five runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying anything,'' Valentin said about being waved
home.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie Greene cranked a two-run home run off Bret
Saberhagen in the fourth inning to make it 7-3, the Blue Jays
appeared well on their way to their 10th win in the last 11 games,
much to the delight of a SkyDome crowd of 38,631 that was lined up
so deep at the ticket windows, the start of the game was delayed 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it appeared the Sox were about to yield more
ground to the Blue Jays in the wild-card sweepstakes, they showed
some of that gumption Huskey detected from a continent away,
playing in Seattle until his trade by the Mariners on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They arose in the fifth inning to score six runs on seven hits
against Blue Jays starter David Wells, who ripped his jersey off in
frustration in the Blue Jays dugout, and reliever Roy Halladay.
They then added two runs in the eighth, which began with Troy
O'Leary's triple, assuaging fears of another comeback by the Blue
Jays, who since June 29 have won 10 games in their last at-bat, 16
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to come back and win a game like this,'' said
Saberhagen, who needed 43 pitches just to get through the second
inning but was picked up Tuesday night by a five-man relief effort
that held the Blue Jays to five hits and two runs (one unearned) in
the last 5 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice we showed a little character to come back and win a
game we probably should have lost,'' he added. ``A lot of people
are putting a lot of emphasis on this short two-game series, and if
we had lost tonight, that probably would have put a lot of pressure
on us to win tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even August and there are a lot of games left, but we
just need to get things a little better. I couldn't find the groove
tonight, but there's no need to jump off a bridge. To spit the hook
and still win the game, that's beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskey played his part in the decisive fifth inning with an RBI
single that should have gone into the books as a three-run home
run, according to replays showing the ball striking a bar in the
bullpen, beyond the outfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the longest singles I've ever seen,'' said Williams.
``But what do we have here? I'm a guy who wears glasses just to
read.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskey certainly thought it was a homer, waving his index finger
in a circular motion that umpires use to signal a home run. But it
wasn't mirrored by third-base umpire Bill Welke, who instead gave
the ``safe'' sign, meaning the ball was still in play.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The Sox, who had 14 hits in the first five
innings, including seven doubles, managed to clear the bases even
after Huskey was denied that privilege.
</P>
<P>
   An inning that began with a double by Garciaparra and singles by
Mike Stanley and Huskey continued with a two-run groundball double
by Troy O'Leary, a successful squeeze by Damon Buford, RBI doubles
by Jason Varitek and Valentin sandwiched around a walk by Lewis,
and an RBI single by Garciaparra, his second hit of the inning, one
in which 11 Sox batters paraded to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, turning suddenly cautious, elected not to wave home
Valentin on Garciaparra's hit _ a ground ball up the middle _ for
what would have been Boston's 10th run. Perhaps he was aware of the
way Valentin flung his helmet when he returned to the dugout in the
first inning, which began with Lewis's double and Valentin's
single. Garciaparra followed with a double that scored Lewis, but
Kim decided to try and have Valentin score on the play, too, even
with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto scored once in the sixth when All-Star outfielder Shawn
Green, who earlier extended his hitting streak to 25 games, was hit
with a pitch by Rheal Cormier with the bases loaded. But Cormier
then induced cleanup man Carlos Delgado to roll into a double play
(``biggest outs of the night,'' Williams said), then combined with
Derek Lowe to strike out the side in the seventh. Tim Wakefield
finished for his 13th save, with the win going to Mark Guthrie, his
first with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used six pitchers, nine other players, 15 players to help
you win a game,'' Williams said. ``From our standpoint, it's a good
win.''

KANSAS CITY CASINO REVENUES ARE DOWN $3 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the temperature rose in June, Kansas City's riverboat
gamblers cooled off.
</P>
<P>
   Casino revenues slipped by nearly $3 million, to $39.3 million,
after record-setting months of $42 million-plus in March, April and
May, according to the latest reports by the Missouri Gaming
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel led the
local marketplace, posting a $14.1 million month. Harrah's also
wrapped up Missouri's 1999 fiscal year on June 30 as the statewide
overall market leader, with a record $169 million year.
</P>
<P>
   Station Casino Kansas City last September surpassed Harrah's as
Kansas City's market leader, but after one month slipped back to
second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I like being in second place? No,'' said John Finamore,
Station vice president and general manager. ``We're still learning
what works best here and what our guests respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that Station's corporate strategy for the near
term was paying down debt. That means fewer giveaways, especially
cash coupons that bring in the foot traffic, but at a steep cost to
the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have responsibilities to our shareholders,' Finamore said.
``We're very focused on the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's General Manager Michael St. Pierre could not be reached
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Sam's Town casino in Kansas City closed a year ago, Station
and Flamingo Hilton Casino grabbed the lion's share of Sam's
customers. Since then, the marketplace has stabilized, with
Harrah's and Argosy Riverside Casino posting modest gains.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Kansas City casino market expanded by about 8.5
percent from the 1998 fiscal year, to $475 million from $438
million.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same story statewide, only more so, with annual
growth of 11.9 percent to $898 million from $803 million a year
ago. Kansas City's four casino operations represented almost 53
percent of the statewide total, a slight drop from 55 percent a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Taylor, executive director of the statewide anti-gambling
lobby Casino Watch, laments the growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are now spending more annually on gambling than they
do on groceries,'' he said, quoting a congressional study on the
effects of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that along with the increase in revenue is an
increase in compulsive gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   While Harrah's paced all local and state competitors for the
past 12 months, it did so while drawing fewer customers _ 6.5
million compared with 7.3 million a year ago. The difference is
those gamblers, on the average, are wagering and losing more this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The average Harrah's gambler left behind $25.93 per two-hour
visit over the past 12 months. The figure a year ago was $23.47.
Statewide, the average is $22.02.
</P>
<P>
   Station draws more visitors than Harrah's by virtue of more
restaurants, bars, theaters and other nongambling attractions. But
those visitors gamble less, averaging about $20.67 per two-hour
cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's wasn't alone in entertaining fewer visitors the past 12
months. Overall attendance slipped in the Kansas City market, to
21.4 million from 22.1 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That number could rebound, however, if the Missouri Gaming
Commission eliminates its restrictions on boarding times and allows
open boarding later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission was scheduled to meet today in Jefferson
City to discuss whether to approve an open-boarding pilot project
this summer that could be in place within a month, probably in the
St. Louis market and aboard the Admiral riverboat.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators last year devised a pilot project as a way to
ease into round-the-clock gambling on weekends, which now is the
rule statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Casino Watch's Taylor said his group objected to the
pilot-project approach. He said the Gaming Commission ought to wait
for the Missouri General Assembly to approve such a fundamental
change in the state's casino environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gaming Commission should be enforcing laws, not making
public policy,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The change does not require legislative action. Commission
officials have said the boarding-times rule was enacted as a way to
equalize competition in the St. Louis area, which has had the
permanently docked Admiral riverboat in operation since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Casino patronage statewide was up slightly during the past 12
months, with 40.8 million two-hour cruise visits, compared with
39.5 million in fiscal year 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ryan, executive director of the Missouri Riverboat Gaming
Association, said the revenue growth meant ``$162 million (in
gaming taxes) that will go to education. That's $17 million more
than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Argosy Riverside Casino maintained the local market's
``loosest slots'' title, again posting the highest electronic-games
jackpot payoffs to players in the most popular denominations _
nickels, quarters and dollars.

RIVERSIDE HAS NEW POST OFFICE, BUT NOT ZIP CODE THEY WANTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ZIP is gone from the joy Riverside officials felt when the
city's first full-service post office opened this month.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, Riverside paid the $2 million building tab
to get better mail service. But what officials sought and prized
most _ the city's own ZIP code instead of sharing those issued for
Kansas City neighborhoods _ is still an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Two ZIPs once shared by Riverside and Kansas City were
consolidated into one 64150 code for mail delivery within
Riverside. That ZIP had served much of Riverside, and the U.S.
Postal Service now considers it the city's own ZIP.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent notice from the Postal Service told patrons they
could use either Riverside or Kansas City as their home city in
mailing addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they need to do now is write us a check for $2 million,''
said Mayor Ed Rule. ``We wasted our time and money if we didn't get
our own ZIP code.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's disappointment surprised U.S. Postal Service
officials in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a shared ZIP, and I believe they understood that
when it started,'' said Jim Herrmann, operations and project
support manager.
</P>
<P>
   The ZIP is shared in that Riverside has a branch of the Kansas
City post office, not its own post office with a postmaster.
</P>
<P>
   But Rule said Riverside thought it was getting its own post
office and ZIP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very unhappy,'' Rule said. ``It's the only reason we
built it, to get our own ZIP code.''
</P>
<P>
   One fear of Riverside officials is that residents and businesses
will give a Kansas City address and Riverside will lose tax
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   That is valid, says Pat Gifford, manager of sales and use taxes
for the Missouri Department of Revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem statewide and nationwide, especially with use
taxes,'' Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   The department shares its list of business taxpayers with cities
so officials can check to see whether any businesses are missing,
but problems can still arise.
</P>
<P>
   A city's share of sales tax from an automobile purchase, based
on the buyer's residency, may go to the wrong coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a (Riverside) person says they're from Kansas City, we
might not have any reason to question that,'' Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban cities losing use taxes from purchases made over the
Internet or through mail order catalogues is a growing problem.
</P>
<P>
   If a Riverside resident or business purchases merchandise
through the Internet and gives a mailing address as Kansas City,
Gifford said, Kansas City would get the tax money.
</P>
<P>
   Rule said Riverside had never done an audit to determine the
extent of its tax losses, if any. Officials are concerned, though,
because the city has no property tax for operating costs, only a
sales tax. Also, a new flood levee nearing construction is expected
to bring more commercial businesses operating regionally and
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But pride also is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   When Rule last renewed his driver's license, he turned one in
that said he was from Riverside. He got a new one that said he was
from Kansas City _ because of the ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents have faced similar situations, like having to
get proof from City Hall that they lived in Riverside and weren't
trying to avoid Kansas City taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann said the Postal Service has changed its computer system
so the 64150 ZIP shows not only Kansas City but also Riverside and
indicates that Riverside is the preferred address.
</P>
<P>
   The first three ZIP numbers, 641, signify the Kansas City Post
Office. To have its own code, Riverside needs a ZIP that begins
with 640.
</P>
<P>
   So why not give them a 640 code?
</P>
<P>
   The assigned 641 ZIP was a directive from postal officials in
Washington and St. Louis, Herrmann said. And the trend is to
consolidate services rather than expand.
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials say the Postal Service has met its
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The 64150 boundary matches Riverside's municipal boundary, said
Jackie Estes, an operations specialist in Washington who met with
city officials when the idea was proposed. The Postal Service
delivers mail but isn't responsible for other entities adopting ZIP
codes for uses they weren't designed for, such as sorting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard or seen anything yet that somebody promised
something that wasn't delivered,'' Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   Riverside's initial request in 1997 for a new post office and
its own ZIP code was denied by the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   So city officials rallied congressional support and in 1998
traveled to Washington. They offered to spend riverboat gambling
revenue to build a post office in exchange for full service and a
single ZIP code. This time the Postal Service agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann said the agreement from the beginning was for a shared
ZIP. A survey of postal patrons in April 1998 as planning for the
post office began stated that addresses could be Kansas City or
Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe when we sit down and talk about this, we'll remedy
this,'' Herrmann said. ``Hopefully, they'll remember some of the
discussions they had.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rule said he was told the Kansas City reference in the
survey was intended for patrons living outside of Riverside, not
Riverside residents.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and City Attorney Steve Crystal say Riverside's
contract with the Postal Service calls for the city to have its own
ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   After accepting use of the building, the contract says, ``the
Postal Service will grant to the City of Riverside their own
designated Riverside, Missouri Zip Code Delivery number for this
newly constructed postal facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule believes that makes it clear that Kansas City shouldn't be
acceptable in a Riverside address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll talk, but we don't have much to say,'' Rule said. ``We
have an agreement, and we'll take whatever steps we need to enforce
it.''

PROPOSED ROAD FOR COPPER RIVER DELTA HAS ENVIRONMENTALISTS AGHAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORDOVA, Alaska _ The Copper River, renowned for succulent
salmon that create an annual frenzy in Seattle-area restaurants and
markets, is home to Alaska's fiercest environmental battle _ one
that some believe could count salmon among its casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The latest skirmish over the big muddy river, which enters the
Gulf of Alaska 150 miles southeast of Anchorage, will be fought
Wednesday at a House hearing in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Copper River is known not only for its first-of-the season
fishery, but for its 700,000-acre delta. It is North America's
largest wetland, visited annually by 16 million seabirds and home
to the continent's largest populations of beavers and otters.
</P>
<P>
   But the delta also is an impediment to logging some 8,000 acres
of timber owned by the Chugach Alaska Corp. The native-owned
corporation wants to build a road through the wild eastern reaches
of the Copper River Delta to log forests at a site called Carbon
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   They claim the land and the salmon would be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are aghast.
</P>
<P>
   Concern for the environment
</P>
<P>
   The road would cross 27 miles of Chugach National Forest land
and traverse what Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman calls ``an
extraordinarily environmentally sensitive area managed for wildlife
and fish.'' The region was put into the national forest system 90
years ago by President Theodore Roosevelt to prevent such
exploitation as logging and mining.
</P>
<P>
   The project would ``change the entire character'' of the Copper
River Delta, said Dune Lankard, a Cordova native and Chugach Alaska
Corp. shareholder. Lankard will testify in Washington, D.C., on
Wednesday on behalf of opponents ranging from the Eyak Tribal
Elders Council to the National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the eastern part of the delta is totally wild. You
really have to want to get there. ... A heavily used logging road
would inevitably impair wildlife and aesthetic values and could
even threaten the Copper River salmon fishery,'' said Lankard, who
fishes the delta and was named last year a ``Hero for the Planet''
by Time magazine for his environmental activism.
</P>
<P>
   The Copper River Salmon Producers Association argued in a letter
to Congress that the proposed road ``may irreversibly damage'' the
delta and possibly its fishery.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation took ownership of the land it wants to log under
the provisions of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, in
which native corporations were given some of the state's richest
timberlands, most previously part of the Chugach and Tongass
national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Some cash-strapped native corporations allowed their forests to
be clearcut, often with huge volumes of slash left on the ground
and without replanting. Stream protection has been ignored in road
building.
</P>
<P>
   Sheri Buretta, new chairwoman of Chugach Alaska, insists her
corporation is different. ``In areas we have cut, we have
replanted,'' she said. ``We care very much about the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters make their case
</P>
<P>
   The Chugach Alaska Corp. denies that it would do anything to
endanger salmon runs, which are fished by many of its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest our road is going to keep salmon off (the) plates
of people in Seattle is ludicrous,'' said Rick Rogers, the
corporation's manager of lands and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Chugach Alaska attorney Peter Giannini said the corporation has
picked a route that mitigates environmental impacts ``to the
fullest extent possible'' and that ``moves around the wetlands.''
</P>
<P>
   The road is championed by Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of
the House Resources Committee. Young has introduced legislation to
order the Forest Service to grant the Chugach Alaska Corp. a
road-building easement across national forest land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes the legislation, and Rep. Jay
Inslee, D-Wash., a member of the Resources Committee, has concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting a swath through the world's largest wetland, in a
river system famous for its salmon, gives me concern,'' Inslee
said. ``I would be very reluctant for Congress to step in and give
orders to the Forest Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Young charges the administration with ``animus toward property
owners in Alaska's national forests.'' He argues that enough
forests have already been ``locked up'' in the Chugach and Tongass
national forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we denying the employment of Alaskans and the survival
of towns when we already have the trees set aside?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   On the Copper River itself, the major resource at issue is not
trees, but the river's prized salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   The pink salmon and herring fisheries of nearby Prince William
Sound have endured periods of steep decline since the 1989 Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   Copper River salmon are the economic lifeblood of the town of
Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for their oil content and rich flavor, Copper River
kings have become a celebrity of the salmon world. Television
stations film the race to get the fish into Seattle markets each
May.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon are also cherished by Alaskans. Upriver, a narrow
road gives access to the Copper River as it plunges through Wood
Canyon south of the hamlet of Chitina. On spring and early summer
weekends, all accessible spots on the river's west bank are
occupied by fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed alternative
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Federation recently commissioned a study
by the Oregon-based consulting firm of ECONorthwest on the
economics of the proposed road and logging. It concluded that the
logging was unlikely to be profitable and that Chugach Alaska Corp.
might lose a substantial amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders in the corporation would get a much greater return
on their money if they give up attempts at logging and negotiate a
conservation easement with the federal government, said Tony
Turrini, director of the Alaska office of the National Wildlife
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   An easement would allow the native corporation to retain title
to the land, but it would give up development rights in exchange
for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   A model for sale of development rights exists in Prince William
Sound, just west of the Copper River Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon Corp. agreed to a $900 million settlement and $125
million fine for environmental damage done to Prince William Sound
by its 1989 oil spill. The money was put under management of a
committee of federal and state trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past eight years, the trustees have used the money to
purchase conservation easements on more than 650,000 acres of
native-owned land on Kodiak and Afognak islands, and in Prince
William Sound. The result has been a $380 million windfall to
native village corporations _ and major tracts of salmon habitat
spared from logging.
</P>
<P>
   The conservation acquisitions have been opposed by Alaska's
pro-development congressional delegation. Under pressure, trustees
have earmarked most of the remaining Exxon money for scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
   Young's bill would give the Chugach Alaska Corp. the right to
reclaim burial sites and historically important lands that it says
were ```inappropriately acquired'' by the spill trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Lankard, the Chugach Alaska shareholder who opposes the road
project, scoffs at the provision. He points out that in 1992 a
native corporation clearcut Eyak Indian village and burial sites
near Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, these culturally sensitive lands have more
protection now then when they were owned by the village
corporations,'' he says in testimony prepared for Wednesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Chugach Alaska Corp. will not consider alternatives until it
is granted an easement for the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``No discussions of any kind are possible without the road
easement,'' said Giannini, the corporation's lawyer. ``Without the
road easement, the land has no value.''
</P>
<P>
   A 100-year war
</P>
<P>
   The Copper River may qualify as America's longest environmental
battle. The fight over its resources rolls on 90 years after
Roosevelt put the delta into America's second-largest national
forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theodore Roosevelt's legacy is unfinished,'' said Turrini of
the National Wildlife Federation. ``He attempted to protect one of
the world's great places. So far, we have been unsuccessful in
finishing the job. Nearly 100 years later, we are fighting the same
battles.''
</P>
<P>
   A different view comes from Buretta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy Roosevelt identified this land as pristine and pure,''
she said. ``All that is fine. Look at all the national parks that
the conservationists have succeeded in creating in Alaska. What we
want is to achieve the rights to our lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``To cast judgment on what we do with that land, before we have
done anything, is unfair.''

NTSB HEAD ASSAILS PIPELINE AGENCY FOR `DISMAL' SAFETY RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal agency responsible for protecting the
public from pipeline accidents is a failure, the government's top
safety official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman James Hall blasted
the Office of Pipeline Safety for disregarding not only safety
recommendations from his agency, but also requirements imposed by
Congress. He said some pipeline accidents in recent years,
including the deadly explosion in Bellingham, Wash., last month,
could have been prevented if the federal government had heeded the
safety board's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their mission statement, they say their mission is to
protect the American people and the environment,'' Hall said.
``They have failed in that mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that the pipeline agency has not followed a
29-year-old recommendation to require the installation of automated
valves to speed the shutdown of leaking pipelines, a 12-year-old
recommendation for a requirement for regular inspections of
pipeline integrity and a 12-year-old recommendation for improved
pipeline personnel training.
</P>
<P>
   He called the agency's inaction ``unacceptable,'' described the
rules the agency has adopted as ``too little, too late,'' and
concluded by saying ``this dismal record has continued far too long
and it needs to be addressed immediately and more aggressive action
has got to be taken if we are going to protect public safety and
our environment in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The blistering criticism from Hall came during a congressional
hearing on the renewal of pipeline-safety laws, which expire next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the transportation subcommittee holding the
hearing, Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., described himself as ``very
troubled'' by Hall's criticism of the Office of Pipeline Safety. He
pledged to hold a separate hearing on the Bellingham accident and
said he will not cooperate with efforts by friends of the oil and
gas industry to rush renewal of the pipeline safety laws through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Office of Pipeline Safety) have clearly had a
grossly unacceptable record of adopting regulations,'' Franks said.
``That's very troubling to me, particularly in areas as critical as
operator training and automatic shutoff valves. ... There will be
steps taken, in view of today's hearing, to put direct pressure on
(the Office of Pipeline Safety) to move toward adopting
comprehensive training and automatic shutoff valve regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was officially about the arcana of pipeline safety
laws, but it was overshadowed by the specter of the horrific
explosion in Bellingham, which killed two boys and a teenager. With
a photograph of the giant tower of smoke rising over Bellingham on
June 10 resting on a nearby easel, every congressman who spoke
expressed sorrow over the Bellingham incident, as did officials
from the industry, the National Transportation Safety Board and the
Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families in your district have borne a tragedy that no
family should have to endure, and I hope that you will let them
know and convey to them the seriousness of this subcommittee in
seeing that those young people did not die in vain,'' the ranking
Democrat on the committee, Rep. Robert Wise, D-W.Va., said to the
congressman who represents Bellingham, Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf, the first witness to testify, laid out in painstaking
detail the events of June 10: how a pipeline ruptured and spilled
so much gasoline into Whatcom Creek that the water level rose
several feet; how two young boys playing with bottle rockets in a
nearby park accidentally ignited the liquid gasoline, setting off
an explosion that incinerated them and an 18-year-old
fly-fisherman; how a fireball then raced as much as 1.5 miles down
the creek, killing everything in the water and as much as 200 feet
on either side of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret the difficult circumstances which brought me here
today,'' Metcalf said. He went on to warn that although underground
pipelines criss-cross the nation, ``there are precious few people
who possess a thorough knowledge of the industry,'' and said that
in his own study of what went wrong in Bellingham, ``my discussions
regarding the Office of Pipeline Safety have been the most
troubling of all.''
</P>
<P>
   The administrator of the Office of Pipeline Safety, Kelley
Coyner, said she is willing to entertain the legislative
recommendations of members of the Washington state congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragic consequence of pipeline incidents such as
Bellingham underscore the need for all of us to have unremitting
attention to the impact of pipeline transportation on people's
lives,'' Coyner said.
</P>
<P>
   Coyner said she is committed to eliminating all deaths from
pipeline accidents, and said that she is particularly concerned
that as the number of incidents has declined, the number of
fatalities has risen, particularly in accidents involving gas
distribution systems. (Environmental groups disagree that the
number of incidents is declining, and the gas industry disagrees
that the number of fatalities is rising.)
</P>
<P>
   Coyner defended her agency's handling of safety recommendations,
saying that sometimes her agency has simply disagreed with the
safety board, while at other times the recommendations require
complex regulations that take time to develop.

ARIZONA EYES DREIFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Arizona Diamondbacks are concerned that
pitcher Todd Stottlemyre, on the disabled since May after
undergoing shoulder surgery, might not be healthy enough for the
stretch drive and are interested in obtaining Dodgers right-hander
Darren Dreifort, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort has pitched twice against the Diamondbacks this season
and been impressive both times, and it's becoming more apparent the
only way the Dodgers will be able to make a major move before
Saturday's trading deadline is to include one of their starting
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   It's uncommon for teams to make a deal within the division,
especially one that can come back to haunt them. But general
manager Kevin Malone said he would deal within the NL West if he
had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would prefer not to, but if you could make yourself
better and improve your club, you have to consider it,'' said
Malone, speaking of no deal in particular. ``I think it would just
have to be the best option for the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Dodgers played Cincinnati on Tuesday, manager Davey
Johnson said the organization might move one of the pitchers for
the right price. Sources said Arizona would be willing to move
lefty Brian Anderson, who pitched eight shutout innings against the
Dodgers on Saturday, but they would be stuck if the Dodgers insist
on Double-A pitcher John Patterson being in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to give up pitchers, especially when you talk
about the talent of (Ismael) Valdes, (Chan Ho) Park and Dreifort,''
Johnson said. ``I'm not in favor of doing anything that would make
us weaker, unless I'm extremely confident it would make us stronger
today, tomorrow, in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort is 8-9 with a 5.68 ERA, and his inconsistency has
management frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the interest regarding a Dodgers starter surrounds
Valdes, who is 8-8 with a 3.33 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Malone and Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden talked before
the game about the Reds acquiring Valdes, but the Dodgers want
either reliever Scott Williamson or Danny Graves and a prospect,
sources said. The Reds, who use a bullpen by committee, are
reluctant to deal one of their key relievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you trade one of your best pitchers?'' Johnson said in
regards to Valdes. ``Only if those players (acquired) will be an
immediate help to the ballclub next year. They have to be close.
Double-A, Triple-A.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring training update: The Fort McDowell Indian Community's
proposed $40million spring training complex near Phoenix is being
reviewed by the Dodgers, and the biggest obstacle isn't the
physical layout but the revenue split.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers director of business development Fred Coons said terms
need to be worked out with money brought in from parking, tickets
and concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many different variables,'' Coons said. ``We
obviously are working diligently and haven't given up hope, but
there's so many issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort McDowell's plan doesn't include the on-site housing the
Dodgers wanted, but it does include six practice fields and the
stadium. Fort McDowell wants an answer from the Dodgers within the
next few weeks, or it will begin looking for other teams to lure to
the complex.
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Todd Hollandsworth started in right field in place of Raul
Mondesi, whose average has dropped to .241.... Craig Counsell got
his first start at second since Eric Young was benched.

NTSB HEAD ASSAILS PIPELINE AGENCY FOR `DISMAL' SAFETY RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal agency responsible for protecting the
public from pipeline accidents is a failure, the government's top
safety official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman James Hall blasted
the Office of Pipeline Safety for disregarding not only safety
recommendations from his agency, but also requirements imposed by
Congress. He said some pipeline accidents in recent years,
including the deadly explosion in Bellingham, Wash., last month,
could have been prevented if the federal government had heeded the
safety board's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their mission statement, they say their mission is to
protect the American people and the environment,'' Hall said.
``They have failed in that mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that the pipeline agency has not followed a
29-year-old recommendation to require the installation of automated
valves to speed the shutdown of leaking pipelines, a 12-year-old
recommendation for a requirement for regular inspections of
pipeline integrity and a 12-year-old recommendation for improved
pipeline personnel training.
</P>
<P>
   He called the agency's inaction ``unacceptable,'' described the
rules the agency has adopted as ``too little, too late,'' and
concluded by saying ``this dismal record has continued far too long
and it needs to be addressed immediately and more aggressive action
has got to be taken if we are going to protect public safety and
our environment in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The blistering criticism from Hall came during a congressional
hearing on the renewal of pipeline-safety laws, which expire next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the transportation subcommittee holding the
hearing, Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., described himself as ``very
troubled'' by Hall's criticism of the Office of Pipeline Safety. He
pledged to hold a separate hearing on the Bellingham accident and
said he will not cooperate with efforts by friends of the oil and
gas industry to rush renewal of the pipeline safety laws through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Office of Pipeline Safety) have clearly had a
grossly unacceptable record of adopting regulations,'' Franks said.
``That's very troubling to me, particularly in areas as critical as
operator training and automatic shutoff valves. ... There will be
steps taken, in view of today's hearing, to put direct pressure on
(the Office of Pipeline Safety) to move toward adopting
comprehensive training and automatic shutoff valve regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was officially about the arcana of pipeline safety
laws, but it was overshadowed by the specter of the horrific
explosion in Bellingham, which killed two boys and a teenager. With
a photograph of the giant tower of smoke rising over Bellingham on
June 10 resting on a nearby easel, every congressman who spoke
expressed sorrow over the Bellingham incident, as did officials
from the industry, the National Transportation Safety Board and the
Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families in your district have borne a tragedy that no
family should have to endure, and I hope that you will let them
know and convey to them the seriousness of this subcommittee in
seeing that those young people did not die in vain,'' the ranking
Democrat on the committee, Rep. Robert Wise, D-W.Va., said to the
congressman who represents Bellingham, Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf, the first witness to testify, laid out in painstaking
detail the events of June 10: how a pipeline ruptured and spilled
so much gasoline into Whatcom Creek that the water level rose
several feet; how two young boys playing with bottle rockets in a
nearby park accidentally ignited the liquid gasoline, setting off
an explosion that incinerated them and an 18-year-old
fly-fisherman; how a fireball then raced as much as 1.5 miles down
the creek, killing everything in the water and as much as 200 feet
on either side of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret the difficult circumstances which brought me here
today,'' Metcalf said. He went on to warn that although underground
pipelines criss-cross the nation, ``there are precious few people
who possess a thorough knowledge of the industry,'' and said that
in his own study of what went wrong in Bellingham, ``my discussions
regarding the Office of Pipeline Safety have been the most
troubling of all.''
</P>
<P>
   The administrator of the Office of Pipeline Safety, Kelley
Coyner, said she is willing to entertain the legislative
recommendations of members of the Washington state congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragic consequence of pipeline incidents such as
Bellingham underscore the need for all of us to have unremitting
attention to the impact of pipeline transportation on people's
lives,'' Coyner said.
</P>
<P>
   Coyner said she is committed to eliminating all deaths from
pipeline accidents, and said that she is particularly concerned
that as the number of incidents has declined, the number of
fatalities has risen, particularly in accidents involving gas
distribution systems. (Environmental groups disagree that the
number of incidents is declining, and the gas industry disagrees
that the number of fatalities is rising.)
</P>
<P>
   Coyner defended her agency's handling of safety recommendations,
saying that sometimes her agency has simply disagreed with the
safety board, while at other times the recommendations require
complex regulations that take time to develop.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, utility executives defended the performance of
the Office of Pipeline Safety, and said the nation's pipeline
safety laws do not need to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bellingham disaster does not represent anything close to
the norm in our industry, and it should not precipitate drastic
changes in public policy,'' said Steven Ball, a pipeline industry
executive who represented the Association of Oil Pipelines and the
American Petroleum Institute. ``Bellingham notwithstanding, oil
pipelines are safe and are getting safer.''

PROPOSED ROAD FOR COPPER RIVER DELTA HAS ENVIRONMENTALISTS AGHAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORDOVA, Alaska _ The Copper River, renowned for succulent
salmon that create an annual frenzy in Seattle-area restaurants and
markets, is home to Alaska's fiercest environmental battle _ one
that some believe could count salmon among its casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The latest skirmish over the big muddy river, which enters the
Gulf of Alaska 150 miles southeast of Anchorage, will be fought
Wednesday at a House hearing in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Copper River is known not only for its first-of-the season
fishery, but for its 700,000-acre delta. It is North America's
largest wetland, visited annually by 16 million seabirds and home
to the continent's largest populations of beavers and otters.
</P>
<P>
   But the delta also is an impediment to logging some 8,000 acres
of timber owned by the Chugach Alaska Corp. The native-owned
corporation wants to build a road through the wild eastern reaches
of the Copper River Delta to log forests at a site called Carbon
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   They claim the land and the salmon would be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are aghast.
</P>
<P>
   Concern for the environment
</P>
<P>
   The road would cross 27 miles of Chugach National Forest land
and traverse what Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman calls ``an
extraordinarily environmentally sensitive area managed for wildlife
and fish.'' The region was put into the national forest system 90
years ago by President Theodore Roosevelt to prevent such
exploitation as logging and mining.
</P>
<P>
   The project would ``change the entire character'' of the Copper
River Delta, said Dune Lankard, a Cordova native and Chugach Alaska
Corp. shareholder. Lankard will testify in Washington, D.C., on
Wednesday on behalf of opponents ranging from the Eyak Tribal
Elders Council to the National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the eastern part of the delta is totally wild. You
really have to want to get there. ... A heavily used logging road
would inevitably impair wildlife and aesthetic values and could
even threaten the Copper River salmon fishery,'' said Lankard, who
fishes the delta and was named last year a ``Hero for the Planet''
by Time magazine for his environmental activism.
</P>
<P>
   The Copper River Salmon Producers Association argued in a letter
to Congress that the proposed road ``may irreversibly damage'' the
delta and possibly its fishery.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation took ownership of the land it wants to log under
the provisions of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, in
which native corporations were given some of the state's richest
timberlands, most previously part of the Chugach and Tongass
national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Some cash-strapped native corporations allowed their forests to
be clearcut, often with huge volumes of slash left on the ground
and without replanting. Stream protection has been ignored in road
building.
</P>
<P>
   Sheri Buretta, new chairwoman of Chugach Alaska, insists her
corporation is different. ``In areas we have cut, we have
replanted,'' she said. ``We care very much about the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters make their case
</P>
<P>
   The Chugach Alaska Corp. denies that it would do anything to
endanger salmon runs, which are fished by many of its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest our road is going to keep salmon off (the) plates
of people in Seattle is ludicrous,'' said Rick Rogers, the
corporation's manager of lands and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Chugach Alaska attorney Peter Giannini said the corporation has
picked a route that mitigates environmental impacts ``to the
fullest extent possible'' and that ``moves around the wetlands.''
</P>
<P>
   The road is championed by Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of
the House Resources Committee. Young has introduced legislation to
order the Forest Service to grant the Chugach Alaska Corp. a
road-building easement across national forest land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes the legislation, and Rep. Jay
Inslee, D-Wash., a member of the Resources Committee, has concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting a swath through the world's largest wetland, in a
river system famous for its salmon, gives me concern,'' Inslee
said. ``I would be very reluctant for Congress to step in and give
orders to the Forest Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Young charges the administration with ``animus toward property
owners in Alaska's national forests.'' He argues that enough
forests have already been ``locked up'' in the Chugach and Tongass
national forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we denying the employment of Alaskans and the survival
of towns when we already have the trees set aside?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   On the Copper River itself, the major resource at issue is not
trees, but the river's prized salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   The pink salmon and herring fisheries of nearby Prince William
Sound have endured periods of steep decline since the 1989 Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   Copper River salmon are the economic lifeblood of the town of
Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for their oil content and rich flavor, Copper River
kings have become a celebrity of the salmon world. Television
stations film the race to get the fish into Seattle markets each
May.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon are also cherished by Alaskans. Upriver, a narrow
road gives access to the Copper River as it plunges through Wood
Canyon south of the hamlet of Chitina. On spring and early summer
weekends, all accessible spots on the river's west bank are
occupied by fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed alternative
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Federation recently commissioned a study
by the Oregon-based consulting firm of ECONorthwest on the
economics of the proposed road and logging. It concluded that the
logging was unlikely to be profitable and that Chugach Alaska Corp.
might lose a substantial amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders in the corporation would get a much greater return
on their money if they give up attempts at logging and negotiate a
conservation easement with the federal government, said Tony
Turrini, director of the Alaska office of the National Wildlife
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   An easement would allow the native corporation to retain title
to the land, but it would give up development rights in exchange
for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   A model for sale of development rights exists in Prince William
Sound, just west of the Copper River Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon Corp. agreed to a $900 million settlement and $125
million fine for environmental damage done to Prince William Sound
by its 1989 oil spill. The money was put under management of a
committee of federal and state trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past eight years, the trustees have used the money to
purchase conservation easements on more than 650,000 acres of
native-owned land on Kodiak and Afognak islands, and in Prince
William Sound. The result has been a $380 million windfall to
native village corporations _ and major tracts of salmon habitat
spared from logging.
</P>
<P>
   The conservation acquisitions have been opposed by Alaska's
pro-development congressional delegation. Under pressure, trustees
have earmarked most of the remaining Exxon money for scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
   Young's bill would give the Chugach Alaska Corp. the right to
reclaim burial sites and historically important lands that it says
were ```inappropriately acquired'' by the spill trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Lankard, the Chugach Alaska shareholder who opposes the road
project, scoffs at the provision. He points out that in 1992 a
native corporation clearcut Eyak Indian village and burial sites
near Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, these culturally sensitive lands have more
protection now then when they were owned by the village
corporations,'' he says in testimony prepared for Wednesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Chugach Alaska Corp. will not consider alternatives until it
is granted an easement for the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``No discussions of any kind are possible without the road
easement,'' said Giannini, the corporation's lawyer. ``Without the
road easement, the land has no value.''
</P>
<P>
   A 100-year war
</P>
<P>
   The Copper River may qualify as America's longest environmental
battle. The fight over its resources rolls on 90 years after
Roosevelt put the delta into America's second-largest national
forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theodore Roosevelt's legacy is unfinished,'' said Turrini of
the National Wildlife Federation. ``He attempted to protect one of
the world's great places. So far, we have been unsuccessful in
finishing the job. Nearly 100 years later, we are fighting the same
battles.''
</P>
<P>
   A different view comes from Buretta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy Roosevelt identified this land as pristine and pure,''
she said. ``All that is fine. Look at all the national parks that
the conservationists have succeeded in creating in Alaska. What we
want is to achieve the rights to our lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``To cast judgment on what we do with that land, before we have
done anything, is unfair.''

POLICE MAKE ARREST IN TRIPLE SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VANESSA HO  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Last month, Melvin Johnson Jr. attended a mournful
triple funeral for his family: Someone had killed his sister, niece
and 6-year-old grand-niece in their Mount Baker day care home, and
the killer was on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out Johnson himself was the likely suspect,
according to Seattle police. On Wednesday, a King County judge
ordered him held for investigation of the homicides on a hefty $3
million cash-only bail.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 29, has not been charged in the slayings. King County
Prosecutor's spokesman Dan Donohoe said a decision about whether to
charge the suspect will be made Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the June 8 slayings, homicide detectives believed a
family member killed 50-year-old Patricia Whitfield, a popular day
care provider, her daughter, Artis ``T.Z.'' Ingram, 24, and her
granddaughter Champagne Younger, 6.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives had received a crush of anonymous tips from people
claiming to be relatives accusing other family members of the
killings. But for weeks, detectives didn't have enough information
to make an arrest, and the unsolved slayings permeated relatives
and neighbors with uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, relatives and neighbors viewed the arrest, which
occurred Monday for an unrelated crime, with a mix of melancholy
and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief,'' said a nephew who didn't want to be named.
``At last, we're going to get justice. But it hurts more knowing
that it was `Mellie.' You hate for it to be a family member, but it
wasn't right, and a baby, who didn't even know right from wrong,
was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the killings and arrest have been agonizing for his
large, extended family. Many had suspected Johnson, who had fought
with Whitfield over money and her handling of the house owned by
their mother, who died in 1996. The nephew said Johnson felt
``deceived'' by Whitfield regarding the house, and that despite his
attendance at the funeral, he had been uncharacteristically aloof
after the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last two months, it's been tough,'' the nephew said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle police spokeswoman Pam McCammon would not comment on a
motive, circumstance of arrest, or even the location where Johnson
was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was a teenager, Johnson has seen his share of jail.
When he was 13, he pleaded guilty to attempted rape, in which he
used a knife, according to court records. He has since racked up
numerous convictions for assaults, thefts and drug charges in three
counties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he and Whitfield entered an Alford plea to a charge of
attempted malicious harassment, in which prosecutors accused them
of harassing an interracial couple in the Central District. The
couple wasn't assaulted, but police were called. People entering an
Aflord plea do not admit wrongdoing, but tell the court they are
pleading guilty because they believe there is a substantial
likelihood they would be found guilty at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Johnson was charged with forgery, in which
prosecutors say he forged a $9,000 check to buy a sports car.
</P>
<P>
   The killings shocked the quiet, close-knit neighborhood, where
Whitfield's day care was known as a safe, loving hangout for
children.
</P>
<P>
   The killer had shot the victims overnight. The next morning,
four young children entered the unlocked house, and for about an
hour before going to school, they played near the bodies. Later,
they told police they thought the victims were sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   About six hours later , a relative discovered the bodies, along
with another disturbing find: Ingram's two youngest daughters,
Chandelier Gaines, 1 week old, and Chabrowe Gaines, 11 months, had
been in the house during the slayings. They were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Whitfield's day care home appeared deserted, with
its unmowed lawn, unused toys and missing day care sign. Neighbors
who remembered her as a caring mother said the arrest brought
closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely makes me feel better,'' said Sirelle Wilkerson,
a neighbor living next to Whitfield's house in the 3200 block of
34th Avenue South.

IRVIN'S WORLD IS JUST FINE, HE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Michael Irvin showed up at training camp
Tuesday to work and talk. He held nothing back in either case. His
messages were a mixed bag: He isn't selfish. He isn't feeling any
disrespect. And he isn't going anywhere, not this season.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who understands more than anybody the power of
perception, finished an unsupervised morning workout with
quarterback Troy Aikman and receiver Raghib Ismail on a field
adjacent to where Dallas Cowboys rookies and selected veterans
opened two-a-days at Midwestern State University. Then he spoke his
mind on the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was asked about San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Jerry
Rice's recent comments about being inspired by San Antonio Spurs
center David Robinson, who proclaimed on his way to a first NBA
title that he was willing to take a secondary role at this stage of
his career in order to win a world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Public perception seems to favor Rice for being touched by
Robinson's ability to come to grips with his new role on a team
featuring Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Could something similar come out of Irvin's mouth to
improve his public perception in light of off-season issues that
included him being mentioned in trade talks and possibly taking on
a reduced role in the team's offense?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: We'll never know. ``I don't have to say that,'' Irvin
said of Rice's feel-good reaction to Robinson's feel-good comment.
``Maybe Jerry has done some things in the past that seem very
selfish now, and he has to vindicate himself. I don't feel the same
way about myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been the biggest team player. I've taken less money to
stay here. Everybody knows that I want to do whatever it takes to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I need to say that David Robinson (inspired me)
because by me saying that, I would be saying that I was selfish
when we were winning. And I wasn't that. I think Jerry has come out
and yelled after (the 49ers) won games in which he had only six
catches and somebody else had nine. I catch no balls and we win ...
am I happy with it? No. Do I make a fuss about it? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, 33, will make $2.99 million base salary in the final year
of his contract. In coach Chan Gailey's system, the ball will be
thrown to where the opponents' defense is weakest, not necessarily
to the best receiver on the field. Somebody who has been called
``The Playmaker'' for most of his 11 seasons with the Cowboys might
have some problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said Tuesday that he can live with any gameplan that wins
games for the Cowboys. And he said a lot more about many of the
issues that have made him a topic of conversation in and around
Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin on Gailey's plan to reducing the 33-year-old receiver's
workload without ``changing'' his role:
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan says he's going to try to keep us (older veterans) fresh,
and that's all well and good. But the game will dictate what's
really going to happen. Hopefully, everything works out and we
stick to a plan, but we also have to be smart enough to adjust to
what happens on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin on not having a contract extension:
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, guys, and I don't want this to sound bad, but
financially I'm in seventh heaven. If you guys really think about
where I come from ... quite honestly, I deserve whatever this
franchise sees fit to give me. I'm going to say this again, I have
never barked about needing a long-term deal. I have never, ever
said, in any way, that I felt disrespected. Jerry Jones is a
businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin on comments by former Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson that
Irvin is overpriced at $2.99 million for his production at this
point in his career, and that there is no interest in adding Irvin
to the Dolphins:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy hears that I want out, or whatever you guys reported, so
Jimmy comes out and says those things. All Jimmy is doing is trying
to pull down my value. If I get released, I guarantee you Jimmy is
going to be in line trying to sign me. I've been around long to
understand the business side of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin on what the chances are that he won't be with the Cowboys
this season:
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on. Where am I going to be? I hope this doesn't sound
arrogant, and it may. I've never needed anybody to tell me that I
can play. I've always known I could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin on conversations with Gailey:
</P>
<P>
   ``Every (NFL) team in the Final Four last year had two
1,000-yard receivers. I don't know, but maybe that says you need to
use the pass more than the run, maybe that's the trend now. Chan
said, `Yes, I've thought about that same thing exactly.' These are
the kind of conversations we have... It is never confrontational.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Tuesday afternoon, Irvin ran a few more routes. Between
working and talking, it seemed to be a full day. nn

PHILLIPS MISSED THE CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While Richie Phillips was leading the charge, the
rest of the world was yawning.
</P>
<P>
   While he was railing about the decline of civilization through
the eyes of a baseball union chief, Phillips failed to realize that
nobody cared _ not the fans, not the players, not even his own
people.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, after two weeks of cracking from within, the umpires
told baseball they have decided to rescind the mass resignations
Phillips had planned for Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a good thing? A bad thing? It's nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Phillips' bombast rippled though the sport
because the announcement came the day after the All-Star Game and
there wasn't much going on. Labor lawyers were brought in to
explain Phillips' strategy of mass resignations in an effort to
force baseball to take them seriously. More people wondered, ``Just
how fat is Eric Gregg?''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips failed to realize he wasn't representing players, the
only true commodities in the game. Most of the umpires liked him
because of his arrogance, especially the National League guys, who
used to visit when they came through his native Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In a profession in which presence is almost as important as
calling balls and strikes, he epitomized authority. Phillips had
gotten the umpires a good deal in the last contract, with better
pay, great benefits and in-season vacations. They just didn't feel
loved. Sounds like most of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still behind him,'' said Dana DeMuth, the crew chief
for the Cincinnati Reds/Dodgers series. ``This is not a reflection
on him, just some weakness in our ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   As the last two weeks proved, that is not exactly true. The
American League umpires knew they wouldn't have much leverage when
the old agreement expired in December. They also knew that they
couldn't walk out because there is a no-strike clause in the
existing contract.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern was forfeiting the $15 million in severance they
are due. The umpires thought a strike would void their contract and
void everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips made the umpires believe they were bound by law to get
the $15 million now. Baseball would see how much they were needed,
especially during the postseason when everyone is watching.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Phillips looked stronger when minor-league umpires, who
do not have a union of their own, said they would not work if the
big guys resigned. But that movement quickly fizzled when they
realized that nobody cared.
</P>
<P>
   For months, commissioner Bud Selig had his own pit bull, Sandy
Alderson, figuring out a contingency plan. High school and college
umpires looked pretty good to him.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the biggest issue was control. Baseball wanted to put
umpires under their umbrella. Umpires wanted to govern themselves.
They didn't want the commissioner's office to tell them when an
umpire was getting too old or out of shape to remain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   The union wanted to protect its own. Baseball wanted to hire and
fire based on a merit system. The union thought seniority had to
count for something. In that regard it was a classic
union/management showdown, but this never was going to be the
Teamsters sticking up for the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice if the Major League Players Association
had become part of the debate. The players crush the owners every
time there is a labor dispute. After each settlement, they talk
about having a greater say in the day-to-day operation of baseball.
They could have sided with the umpires, using the integrity of the
game as a platform.
</P>
<P>
   The players have gotten rich as a result of their union's power
and the owner's lack of solidarity. But the players never had any
intention of getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect them to,'' AL umpire Dale Scott said. ``They
would only come in after the replacement umps were in there and say
how much this was hurting the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners wanted to break the union, that is no secret.
Baseball is wrong to think trained seals could do the job.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the union filed a suit against baseball, claiming it
was not bargaining in good faith on a new contract. It is right and
probably will win that suit.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad that 20 umpires are expected to lose their jobs as a
result of Phillips' strutting, but they probably would have been
out anyway during the next collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Now Phillips will be gone, too. And no one will care. He was too
arrogant thinking that The Show could not go on without him. &QL;

DANCER AT CENTER OF VARGAS CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The incident that led to the arrest of boxer
Fernando Vargas of Oxnard on Sunday started when he was confronted
by the ex-boyfriend of a dancer he met at a Santa Barbara strip
club, according to police and reports.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, who was arrested with four companions in the early
morning hours for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon,
met the woman at the Spearmint Rhino, where the ex-boyfriend works
as a bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   The dancer _ whose name is being withheld by police _ invited
Vargas to the Summerland home she shares with another dancer at the
club, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-boyfriend, identified on Tuesday as 21-year-old Anthony
Arria of Santa Barbara, arrived unannounced _ and uninvited,
according to police _ at the home at about 4 a.m. and an argument
quickly escalated into a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Vargas was in the home by invitation, Mr. Arria was not.
There was some confusion about that (on Monday),'' Santa Barbara
County sheriff's Sgt. Bill Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was broken up by 23-year-old Doug Rossi, who was with
the other woman at the time and had let Arria into the house,
according to police. Afterward, Arria left.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, four of Vargas' companions arrived and beat up
Rossi with unidentified weapons, although police found golf clubs
in the house during their ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The five then left in Vargas' Lexus sports-utility vehicle and
were stopped on the Ventura Freeway by police, who were tipped off
by the woman, and later arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Police had not determined whether Vargas took part in the
beating of Rossi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't specifically identified Vargas in the group that
attacked Mr. Rossi, but we haven't ruled him out, either,'' Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Arria nor Rossi have been arrested, Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' representatives insist he will be vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be pretty obvious to everyone,'' said Shelly Finkel,
Vargas' co-manager.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, 21, and his friends reportedly had frequented the club
about once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he's not well liked by management. Gary Grantham, a
manager at Spearmint Rhino, told the Santa Barbara News-Press that
Vargas has hassled the bouncers and has a ``smart mouth.'' A
spokesman for Spearmint Rhino refused to comment further on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, the IBF junior middleweight champion, recently signed an
endorsement contract with Miller Brewing Company. Miller indicated
in a statement that it's too early to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, until all involved have had the opportunity to
be heard by the legal system, it would be inappropriate for us to
comment further,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested with Vargas were Ernesto Vargas, 27; Vincent Arenas,
20; Carlos Alberto Lopez, 28; and Freddie Flores, 21. All are from
Oxnard.

ABBOTT'S COURAGE IS HALL-WORTHY
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Released by the Brewers, his fastball gone, he knew it was time.
Rather than try again with another team, he reluctantly decided to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   Jim, are you ``sure''?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty accurate,'' Jim Abbott said. ``I'm no Michael
Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he's not.
</P>
<P>
   Like most athletes who parlay talent and hard work to achieve
greatness on the professional stage, Jordan had the luxury of
playing basketball _ a little baseball, too _ with two hands.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott isn't a future Hall of Famer. In years to come, when
visitors go to Cooperstown, where baseball's immortals reside and
the rich history of the game comes alive, they won't find a bronze
likeness of the left-hander who threw a no-hitter and pitched 10
seasons in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But shouldn't there be a place of honor for those who possess a
special spirit and uncommon courage? &QL; 
Spirit counts, too &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The world of sports is enriched by people such as Abbott and
Lance Armstrong who beat the odds and inspire us by performing the
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   If they ever build a Spirit Hall of Fame, Abbott gets my
first-ballot vote.
</P>
<P>
   People sometimes ask those who write about sports to list our
favorite moments. Reading of Abbott's retirement brought back
memories of sitting in a ballpark halfway around the world, trying
to wipe the grin off my face as Abbott and his Olympic teammates _
college kids _ celebrated beating Japan in the gold-medal game.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Abbott was a curiosity. Born without a right hand, he
had played quarterback in high school. He ``hit'' .427 on the
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   When he threw his 94-mph fastball, he put his glove over the end
of his right arm. Before the ball reached the plate, he switched it
to his throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   First time the Cubans saw Abbott, they exchanged sly glances.
``Hey,'' they thought, ``let's run this guy crazy''.
</P>
<P>
   The first four batters bunted. Abbott threw out all four. Cuban
fans gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   We asked Abbott what he could't do. He had to think awhile. He
admitted he had trouble fastening his cuff link.
</P>
<P>
   Using a camera once gave him a problem because the shutter
button was on the right side. To make the button accessible to his
left hand, Jim simply turned the camera upside down. &QL; 
Team comes first &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His senior year, the Blue Jays offered him a contract, but he
opted to stay at the University of Michigan. He became an
All-American and won the Sullivan Award as the nation's top
amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he was in Seoul, last inning of the Olympic
championship game. After the final pitch, the entire U.S. squad
converged on the mound, drawn to the 22-year-old southpaw like
metal filings to a magnet.
</P>
<P>
   Down he went, disappearing beneath the giddy pile.
</P>
<P>
   Baseballs sailed into the stands. One U.S. player stuck the
staff of an American flag into the ground, like Neil Armstrong
claiming the moon.
</P>
<P>
   As his teammates unpiled and took a victory lap around the
field, Abbott climbed to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   His wrist hurt.
</P>
<P>
   He was sore all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, beaming, ``is the greatest feeling in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   How many people close out their amateur careers by pitching a
complete game and winning an Olympic gold medal? The only way it
could have been better was if they had waived the DH rule and let
Abbott hit.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1988 Games, he did what few college players do when he
went directly to the major leagues. He became the first pitcher
with one hand to compete in the big leagues since the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   I loved what he said in announcing his retirement:
</P>
<P>
   ``My career wasn't always great, but it was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   If only all of us someday could look back upon our lives, at the
opportunities we had and the challenges we met, and say the same. &QL;

COWBOYS' TOP TWO DRAFT PICKS ARRIVE IN CAMP AFTER SIGNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys defensive end Ebenezer
Ekuban was hardly the freshest player on the field for the first
day of training-camp workouts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who reached contract agreement with Ekuban late
Monday and second-round pick Solomon Page last night, were hardly
worried.
</P>
<P>
   Not after Ekuban's wild night. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones'
private jet picked him up in Maryland at 1:45 a.m. and got him to
Midwestern State University at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly three hours later Ekuban was up and preparing to go on
the field with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to hold out due to my lack of experience,'' the
former North Carolina standout said. ``I told my agent I didn't
want to haggle over little things. When they told me a plane was on
the way, I had to hurry up and pack. I forgot a couple of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a five-year, $5,625,000 contract, Ekuban should have
no trouble replacing what he forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban's deal calls for him to make base salaries of $280,000,
$350,000, $420,000, $420,000, $490,000 and $560,000 the next five
years. It does not include any performance incentives, but Cowboys
vice president Stephen Jones said the team will reward Ekuban for
superior performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he becomes a great player and fits in with this team, he
probably won't every see the end of his contract,'' Jones said.
``We've historically extended a guy like that and kept them.''
</P>
<P>
   Page's ride to Wichita Falls wasn't as exciting, as he simply
drove in from Dallas last night after an agreement was reached with
his agent, Angelo Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Page got a four-year deal worth $1,982,500 including an $800,000
signing bonus. Page will receiver base salaries of $215,000 in
1999, $268,750 in 2000, $322,500 in 2001 and $376,250 in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied with it,'' Wright said. ``Ekuban's deal and my
deal were good deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Jerry Jones Jr. said he was just happy to
complete the negotiation process and get all of the picks in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our mind, all of our picks that will play for us are in
camp,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have not signed seventh-round pick Kelvin Garmon,
but he is not expected to play this season because of a broken leg.
Jerry Jones Jr. said the Cowboys will turn their attention to
getting some money for Garmon. AIKMAN READY TO GO
</P>
<P>
   Though he won't start practicing in earnest until the rest of
the veterans show up Thursday, Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman says
he's in great shape physically and is ready to begin work outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good,'' Aikman said. ``I feel like I had a good
off-season as far as conditioning is concerned. I am ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey encouraged the veteran quarterbacks
and receivers to report with the rookies, but only to practice
among themselves. The group includes quarterback Jason Garrett,
receivers Michael Irvin, Ernie Mills and Raghib Ismail and tight
end Eric Bjornson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Chan had in mind,'' Aikman said. ``To get us back
into it gradually. We will work in once the veterans come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who didn't participate in any of the team's voluntary
workouts during the spring, said coming early gave them a chance to
work on their timing. LETT TO GIVE BACK BONUS Suspended defensive
tackle Leon Lett already stands to lose a portion of his $400,000
base salary for every game he misses in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stephen Jones acknowledges that Lett will have to pay the
Cowboys back a portion of the $1.5 million signing bonus he
received for restructuring his contract in February. Jones said
it's a standard clause in all contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The league has yet to decide on the length of Lett's suspension,
though the Cowboys quietly believe it will be four games.
</P>
<P>
   Lett stands to lose $23,529 per game in salary and $88,235 per
game in bonus money. nn

IRVIN ERA ENTERS DECISIVE STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ To some, it would be the end of an era. To
others, the end of an error. With Michael Irvin, the public
reaction is basically void of emotional middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 33, Irvin was sweating away Tuesday on the Midwestern
State University practice field. Reality did not escape him, and
neither did most of Troy Aikman's bullet throws.
</P>
<P>
   This was the opening workout of what might well be Irvin's final
training camp for the Dallas Cowboys. He knows it, and he knows we
know he arrived in Wichita Falls needing an 18-wheeler to carry all
his baggage. Which, of course, has nothing to do with an otherwise
ample wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvin odometer shows a lot of football miles going into his
12th Cowboys training camp. Plus, he's coming off what was
personally a nonproductive kind of season. Plus, this is the final
year of a contract with no Jerry Jones renewal offer, at least thus
far. Plus, there are rumblings that coach Chan Gailey might be
ready to move on without Irvin, although Gailey becomes huffy at
the mere mention of that theory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with all this hanging over him, Irvin was a combined
bundle of optimism, enthusiasm and realism Tuesday as the morning
practice came to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm troubled by only one thing,'' he said, ``and that's that
some people seem to think I'm gonna be a problem for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I told Jerry Jones is I'm tired of people trying to make
something out of nothing. And there was nothing to any of the
stories or rumors I wanted to be traded. I never said that. Jerry
knows I never said that. I am closer to Jerry Jones than any player
who has ever been here. I would never do anything to show up
Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, of course, is all about Cowboys history, starting with
him being the last player remaining on the roster who served all
four head coaches. He also either holds or is co-holder of 20
franchise receiving records, including all the major ones. And when
the Cowboys were winning Super Bowls, Irvin was a major reason why.
</P>
<P>
   But on the flip side, there is another kind of Cowboys history _
this one involving the image demise of the '90s. Michael also leads
the team in that decline. And when there's doubt about him being
able to produce on the field, the other stuff will come home to
roost, which is normal. Irvin made his own fouled nest.
</P>
<P>
   What still goes unquestioned, however, is Irvin's work ethic and
his fierce team loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been Christmas every day playing for this team and
playing with this group of guys,'' Irvin said. ``I absolutely love
being here, but if the business end says I have to go elsewhere
next season, then I truly understand and can accept that
unconditionally.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Gailey a 100 percent believer in Irvin's ability?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the answer to that,'' Michael said, ``but for my
sake and the team's sake, he better make everyone believe he still
is. But like I said, if my time is winding down here, I'm not gonna
be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Irvin's overall numbers don't look that bad from
1998: 74 catches for 1,057 yards. Only one touchdown, however, says
the ol' Playmaker wasn't playmaking. Then, in the final five games
of the season, counting the playoffs, Irvin averaged a measly three
catches and 44 yards a game. For the first time in their parallel
careers, Troy Aikman appeared to be looking elsewhere besides Irvin
for an open receiver. In Irvin's case, the emphasis was on
``open.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he blames himself for Irvin's sudden slump, saying
his strategy to help Irvin and the offense ended up backfiring.
Irvin played the inside, or slot receiver, more than his normal
outside position. The idea was to create less double coverage. But
on the outside, the priority is usual on physical force, a Michael
specialty. On the inside, finesse and precise patterns can be the
norm. Irvin didn't fit, and he freely admits to struggling with the
transition. ``I was doing more thinking as opposed to just
reacting,'' Irvin said. ``I wasn't sure of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael will be back doing what he does best,'' said Gailey,
meaning at outside receiver. Free-agent speedster Rocket Ismail was
brought in to handle the inside game and, in theory, to help
Michael work open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Chan,'' Irvin said. ``Chan is always straight in
dealing with you. Our relationship is not confrontational, not even
close (to confrontational). We've talked a lot about why this
didn't work, or what I was thinking when I ran a certain route. I
do admit a preference for the outside (receiver) muscle game. It's
something I do pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting now, Irvin must also re-prove that he can do what he
always did so well. His football clock is ticking in Wichita Falls,
but as of Tuesday, Michael was still full of joy.
</P>
<P>
   With him, the paradox never ends. nn

SAMPRAS DEFEATS TOP JUNIOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He walked onto the UCLA court Tuesday looking like
Pete Sampras' ball boy. He walked off to a standing ovation and had
young kids wanting his autograph despite losing 6-1, 6-2 to the
world's No.2-ranked player in a Mercedes-Benz Cup first-round
match.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the ATP Tour, 17-year-old Phillip King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great,'' said the Long Beach native and this country's
top-ranked junior. ``I live around here and I practice here. I
thought everyone came to see Pete. I couldn't believe how many
people were rooting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Frenchman Guillaume Raoux continued his success in
this event by upsetting third-seeded Tim Henman 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). All
other seeded players posted victories, including top-seeded Andre
Agassi, who won 6-2, 6-2 over Jan-Michael Gambill, who had beaten
Agassi twice previously.
</P>
<P>
   Many among the sold-out crowd must like the underdog, and King
is about as great an underdog as they come.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the prestigious Easter Bowl this spring, King
received a wild-card entry into this, his first pro event. And he
found out at Friday's draw that he got Sampras, who he said seemed
``untouchable'' to him growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had four days to sleep on it,'' he said. ``At first, I
couldn't sleep, then last night I did. (But) once the sun set
(Tuesday), the jitters came back.''
</P>
<P>
   King's goals were modest: Get his racket on the ball, run down
every shot possible and not lose in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Using these guidelines, King could consider this match a
success. It lasted 54 minutes, with King scoring eight points off
Sampras' serve, including a hard cross-court forehand on match
point. He also scored at least one point each time he served.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I wanted to keep the ball in to get a rally
going,'' he said. ``In the middle, I thought, `Oh, no, there's a
rally going. I don't want to mess up. At the end, I felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   He also served consistently above 100 mph and got in 48 percent
of his first serves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, King had no answer for Sampras' drop volleys and six
aces, many of which sped past him at speeds exceeding 130 mph.
Sampras also demonstrated his ability to find the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras broke King to go up 3-1 in the first set and sailed.
King held serve in the second set, getting the score to 2-2 before
Sampras broke him.
</P>
<P>
   King has hit with Sampras before at the Riviera Country Club,
yet he was amazed at the older man's calm demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost startling to me,'' King said. ``It's like trying
to beat up an iron man. You can't knock him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was gracious in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled himself well and tried hard,'' Sampras said. ``He's
going to get better as he gets stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Raoux often seems strong here, having reached the semifinals of
the last two tournaments, beating Mark Philippoussis and Patrick
Rafter in 1997, Goran Ivanisevic last year and now Henman, from who
he had never won a set in four previous meetings. One of those
matches was last year's semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more impressive, Raoux wasn't in perfect health. He
flew 11 hours to get here Saturday from an exhibition in Lebanon,
suffering from diarrhea during the flight. He called the trip his
worst ever.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he became a new father in May, so his motivation for
tennis waned temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, my daughter (Maena) was born,'' he said. ``Life goes on.
My life is tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed as much, winning the first set and breaking Henman to
start the second set. Raoux also knew Henman's penchant for
charging the net, so he modified his second serve to have more
movement. The result was Henman's early exit a week after earning
his highest ranking ever (fifth). This was his first event since
reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I wanted, but it's not a reason to start
panicking,'' Henman said. ``I need to go away and hit lots of balls
on the practice court for the next four to five days until next
week (at Montreal), to get back into a rhythm.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Nine UCLA football players plan to plead guilty of
lying to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get
handicapped-parking permits, and each expects to pay a fine and
perform 200 hours of community service with the disabled, their
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafer Johnson, a 1960 Olympic Games track champion, helped work
out the agreement and is expected to appear in court today on the
players' behalf, sources said. Johnson is active in Special
Olympics, where many of the players are expected to perform their
community service.
</P>
<P>
   Harland Braun, attorney for the nine players who will plead
guilty, said he hopes to persuade five others charged in the case
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to nine of them and will meet with the others and
try to get this behind them. I'm not making excuses for them
because what they did was wrong, but this is a pretty stiff
penalty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would get a $200 fine,'' but the players expect to
be fined as much as $500 each, Braun said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are getting five weeks of community service with
people who won't be too happy with them, and I'm sure they'll let
them know,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The misdemeanor charges carry a maximum sentence of six months
in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the University of California, Los Angeles, will not
comment on the charges or any internal discipline of the players
until the court case is resolved, sports information director Marc
Dellins said.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates for handicapped people said the probable
sentences are too lenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's adequate,'' said David Howell, the head of
Americans Disabled for Attendant Programs Today _ Los Angeles.
``They should do their community service at an independent living
center _ get to know something about the people who do need those
spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Foundation of Independent Living Centers did not
object to a community service sentence but plans a demonstration in
front of the courthouse on the issue of handicapped parking
enforcement in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want them to go to jail, but we want them to heighten
their sensitivity around the issue,'' said Lillibeth Navarro,
foundation spokeswoman. ``Those parking spaces are there for a
reason. They are there for people with disabilities who have real
difficulties competing for parking spaces to do their daily
activities, like shopping and going to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, this issue is on the map. Accessible
parking spaces are routinely violated, and no one thinks about it _
except (the disabled), of course. People go scot-free violating
these spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not decided whether to charge three other
players who have turned professional after graduating from UCLA,
including quarterback Cade McNown, now with the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still waiting to hear from UCLA police on those
cases,'' said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for the City Attorney's
Office. ``Once they complete their case, we'll look at it and take
the appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are accused of illegally obtaining permits by
signing fraudulent statements and using the placards to park in
preferred lots on the crowded UCLA campus.
</P>
<P>
   In their requests for the permits, they claimed a variety of
problems, including knee and back injuries, torn ligaments, asthma
and Bell's palsy, prosecutors say, and they submitted phony names
of physicians.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA police broke the case on Jan. 16 when one officer said he
spotted a car with an improperly placed handicapped permit and was
told by the driver that he borrowed the placard from a football
player.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes were charged with illegally possessing permits and
giving false information to the DMV.
</P>
<P>
   The case sparked outrage among disabled groups and others, and
some said the players should go to jail. It has been a major
embarrassment for the football program, whose season will start
Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Toledo has promised, as an example to others, to add
to any punishment the court administers to the players.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 charged in the case are Deatra Clinton, Ali Abdul Azziz,
Damian Domin Allen, Marque Deon Anderson, Oscar Cabrera, James
Michael Ghezzi, Duval Jerome Hicks and Robert Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Ryan Clint Nece, Durrell Rayton Price, Mark Reynosa, Ryan
Jason Roques, Craig Hilary Walendy and Anthony Dewaye White. All
are from Southern California. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Nine UCLA football players plan to plead guilty of
lying to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get
handicapped-parking permits, and each expects to pay a fine and
perform 200 hours of community service with the disabled, their
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafer Johnson, a 1960 Olympic Games track champion, helped work
out the agreement and is expected to appear in court today on the
players' behalf, sources said. Johnson is active in Special
Olympics, where many of the players are expected to perform their
community service.
</P>
<P>
   Harland Braun, attorney for the nine players who will plead
guilty, said he hopes to persuade five others charged in the case
to do the same.
</P>

   ``I've talked to nine of them and will meet with the others and

L.A. MAKES PROGRESS IN NFL MEETING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As vague as it was, progress was hailed after Gov.
Gray Davis' representative met briefly with the NFL expansion
committee for the first time Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chadwick, given the charge by Davis to direct a unified Los
Angeles' expansion bid, met with the owners in what Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue called a preview of his presentation to the full
membership today.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick faced the owners without anyone from the competing
ownership groups _ Michael Ovitz-Ron Burkle and Eli Broad-Ed Roski
Jr. _ that he has helped bring together in this new-team Los
Angeles effort.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the three-hour meeting consisted of Tagliabue and league
staff updating the expansion committee on progress made since
Chadwick entered the scene six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who has been skeptical over
the Los Angeles bid largely because of a lack of public support,
said he came away encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the Los Angeles position was DOA six weeks ago, and
now it's breathing,'' Jones said. ``Whether or not we can get it to
where we need to in the amount of time that's left to do that is
questionable. Certainly what he was able to do would indicate to me
there is a slim chance of that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the meetings, Jones said he was unimpressed by progress
at the Coliseum and still expected Houston to emerge with the next
expansion team. Los Angeles has until Sept. 15 to convince league
owners the situation is right in Southern California, or the league
said it will next expand to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue termed Tuesday night's meeting a preparation for
today's more involved presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed what has been done, what needs to be done,''
Tagliabue said. ``I think their consensus was, it's still a work in
progress and that we have to keep working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick said he came away convinced that owners believe
tremendous progress has been made in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're looking for a way to say yes,'' Chadwick said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite talks of progress, Chadwick said he did not pass out
copies of financing plan, or detailed site and stadium plans.
Economics remain the owners' biggest concern at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not ask the details,'' he said. ``I was a little bit
surprised. I thought we'd get into that more, and it's a tough area
because there are a lot more questions than answers, but they
really didn't.''

SPARKS BEAT ORLANDO

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The last time the Sparks and Orlando Miracle met,
the Sparks blew a 15-point lead and lost the game by two points.
Not so Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A much improved, defensive-minded Sparks team protected its
16-point halftime lead and blew out the Miracle 81-60 before 5,079,
the Sparks' smallest crowd of the season at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play together on the defensive end, we tend to be a
lot better, and that's what we did tonight,'' Sparks coach Orlando
Woolridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie turned in another stellar game with 19 points, 10
rebounds and four assists as the Sparks (14-6) earned their fourth
consecutive victory and 11th in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was highlight-reel night for the Sparks, but the play of the
game came when they were on a break and Mwadi Mabika flipped the
ball behind her back to Leslie, who sailed in for the layup to give
the Sparks a 75-58 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's top scorer, Nykesha Sales, who averages 14.5 points,
finished the game scoreless on 0-of-8 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   La'Keisha Frett drew most of the defensive duties on Sales but
didn't take all of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just me alone,'' Frett said. ``I played with Nykesha
before on the USA Basketball team and I kind of knew what she
wanted to do. I just tried to take away what she likes to do. She
likes to dip her head a lot and drive a lot. I just tried to put my
forearm on her and hold her back.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks carried a 43-26 lead into halftime and stretched it
to 50-31 less than five minutes into the second half. The Miracle
got as close as 67-58 but was held scoreless in the last 5{
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks got off to a good start against the Miracle, jumping
out to a 20-9 advantage at 11:34. Orlando was able to trim the lead
to seven on two occasions, but the Sparks closed the period with a
14-3 run.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie had 11 points in the first half. Sales picked up three
fouls in the first half and played 10 scoreless minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Grubin converted four 3-pointers and scored 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Taj McWilliams had 17 points and seven rebounds, and Sheri Sam
had 15 points for Orlando (9-11).

SAMPRAS SCHOOLS KING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A King by name and often a king on the court,
Phillip King learned Tuesday night what it's like to live a
pauper's life.
</P>
<P>
   King, a 17-year-old Long Beach resident, had the misfortune of
making his debut on the professional tour against what he considers
the best player ever to grace the court, Pete Sampras, in the first
round of the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   It was quick and painless Sampras won 6-1, 6-2 in 54 minutes but
it was not without some moments to cherish for King.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a pair of break points in the final game and fought
off one set point before walking off the court to a standing
ovation from the sellout crowd of 7,176. He was even asked for his
autograph by a crowd of teen-agers who might have passed for his
classmates at Poly High and afterward talked with Tom Ross, the
agent for Michael Chang.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' King said of the standing ovation. ``I live
here, I practice (at UCLA) sometimes. I didn't think so many people
would be rooting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   King, whose family parents David and Karen and younger sisters
Mindy, Ivana and Vania arrived 2 1/2 hours before the match,
learned on Friday that he would play Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   He professed to having a hard time sleeping until Monday night.
He spent most of Monday playing Legos with his sisters, trying
anything to keep his mind off Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   King found it much more difficult to build any momentum against
Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   King is the No.1-ranked junior in the country, but he's ranked
No.708 overall to Sampras' No. 2. He'd practiced against Sampras
last month at Riviera Country Club but it wasn't until Tuesday that
he found out how big the gap was.
</P>
<P>
   King hustled and made some plays, but Sampras' strength, skill
and shot-making ability left King looking like Sisyphis pushing a
ball around the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like trying to beat up an iron man,'' King said.
``Nothing moves him. ... When I came out I thought he was going to
ace every single point.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the juniors, the mindset is so different. Half the matches
are won because one player thinks he's better than the other. Here
rankings don't mean anything. Nobody breaks down the one who wins
the match is the one who takes the match.''
</P>
<P>
   King managed to hold his serve against Sampras in the second
game, but never came close to winning a game in the first set. In
fact, he won just four points off Sampras' serve the entire match.
Often Sampras' serve which reached into the 130 mph range (about 30
mph faster than King's) just about took the racket out of King's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough at the beginning,'' King said. ``There was
nothing much I could do when he hit winners.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who relied on his scrambling and steady backhand, made it
a little more difficult in the second set. He came from 15-40 down
in the third game, going up 2-1 when he dug a ball out of the
corner and forced Sampras to short hop a volley into the net.
</P>
<P>
   He won the longest rally of the night to stave off a breakpoint
in the fifth game and then was up 40-30 before losing the seventh
game, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   The best tennis was saved for the final game. Sampras, after
double faulting to make it 30-30, hit a backhand into the net after
King chased down three tough shots. He simply responded by firing
an ace.
</P>
<P>
   King answered by passing Sampras for a backhand winner that left
him pumping his left fist.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras then delighted the crowd with something resembling a
Michael Jordan dunk as he ran and leaped at the net before
hammering a lob. King saved a match point, though, by hammering a
forehand return at Sampras feet that he hit into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Sampras put King away with a service winner and an ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled himself well,'' Sampras said. ``He's going to get
better as he gets stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   King appreciated the kind words Sampras gave him at the net
afterward, though he wasn't quite sure what to say himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I could say,'' King said, smiling. ```Thanks
for giving me three games?'''

 ROYALS BEAT UP ON M'S FASSERO; GRIFFEY HITS 33RD HOMER
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Several hours before it got even worse, a
veteran Mariner was asked for an interview on the state of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about the team,'' he said. ``Some things
are better left unsaid.''
</P>
<P>
   And some games are better left unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's game was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners continued their descent, falling 9-7 to the Kansas
City Royals at Kauffman Stadium and dropping to 12 games behind the
Texas Rangers in the American League West. The Mariners weren't
even this far back at the end of last season; they finished their
'98 campaign 11{ games behind.
</P>
<P>
   With scouts from the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox and others
looking on, Jeff Fassero lost his American League-leading 12th
game. Whether it was his final Mariners appearance will be known by
the trading deadline on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what's going to happen,'' Fassero said.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about his preference if he's traded, Fassero
cracked a smile. ``An NL team _ that way, it's all zeroes across
the board. I would hate to go to an AL team and keep the same
numbers,'' he said. ``The NL would be a clean, fresh slate. Over
here, I would have to have the same nasty numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero is 4-12 with a 7.06 earned run average after allowing
six runs on nine hits in 41/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella had considered shifting the left-hander to
the bullpen, but Fassero convinced Piniella he could correct a flaw
he spotted on video, and he kept the start. Piniella said Fassero
is scheduled to start again on Sunday at home against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero shook his head when he mentioned that the Orioles will
start ace Mike Mussina on Sunday. Fassero thought he would avoid
other teams' No. 1 starters when Jamie Moyer took over the No. 1
spot in the M's rotation. But he drew Kevin Appier Tuesday night,
and the Royals right-hander held the Mariners to two runs over
seven innings, improving to 12-3 lifetime against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   It's always something for Fassero this year. He matched Appier
for a while, throwing three shutout innings, then succumbed to a
four-run, two-out rally in the fourth, started by a wild pitch and
sustained by five singles _three sneaking through holes in the
infield, one never reaching the outfield and another up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no walks out there, and I think I went to
three-ball counts on only two guys,'' said Fassero, who slowed his
delivery, which he's been unable to do much of this year. ``I was
ahead of most everybody, which means they were hitting my pitches.
But they were hitting them where we weren't in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do. That's the way everything goes.
You do throw good, and it was frustrating out there tonight.
(Stuff) keeps going on.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Mariners lately, it's been going on against Minnesota
and Kansas City, who share the worst record in the American League.
The M's dropped two of three over the weekend to the Twins, and
both teams have shown something to Piniella. He took note of their
first-to-third speed, as well as their skill at situational
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is young, athletic clubs just taking it to
you,'' said Piniella. ``And they've got some talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth inning exemplified the kind of rally that so often
eludes the older, station-to-station Mariners. Fassero retired 10
of his first 12 hitters before Mike Sweeney doubled with one out.
After getting a second out on a grounder, Fassero threw a wild
pitch, bringing in Sweeney for the game's first run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about that time, he lost concentration,'' pitching
coach Stan Williams said of Fassero. ``He might not agree with
that, but that was my impression. Kind of a `Here we go again' type
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The five singles followed, the Royals' lead swelled to 4-0, and
it only got worse in the fifth. A run-scoring double by Jermaine
Dye knocked out Fassero, and with two outs and Ken Cloude pitching,
a walk, two singles and a throwing error by Ken Griffey Jr. made it
7-1 Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners rallied in the ninth off rookie reliever Ken Ray.
Griffey belted his 33rd home run, a 420-foot, two-run blast to
right, and singles by Edgar Martinez and David Segui put runners at
first and second. With Jay Buhner batting, Ray's pitch got away
from catcher Chad Kreuter, and Martinez broke for third _ where he
was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Three more runs would score, but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mistake was thinking about getting out of the double
play,'' Martinez said. ``But still, it's a terrible play.''
</P>
<P>
   Another that was better left unseen.

A CROWDED SURFING SEASCAPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you go to the Huntington Beach Pier this week, you might not
know where to look first.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the focus definitely would be on surfing. After
all, the mainland United States' only World Championship Tour
surfing event starts today in Huntington Beach, and the creative
and athletic moves of the world's top surfers often have awed
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   However, while the beach's focus still may be on the surfing and
what is called the Gotcha Pro California, other sports will vie for
beach goers' attention.
</P>
<P>
   In-line skating, BMX biking, wakeboarding and skateboarding are
some of the sports that will be played simultaneously with surfing.
Corporate sponsors continue to support these other sports, which
offer $150,000 in prize money, while surfing has $250,600 prize
money at Huntington Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Complementing the sports, more than 20 tents of various
enterprises, from the KROQ radio station to Gold's Gym, are set
along the beach to advertise and hand out freebies.
</P>
<P>
   So while the festival atmosphere can offer beach goers a full
day's activity, the surfing may be affected. Among professional
surfers, there are two reactions to the ever-growing festivities.
The most common reaction is the more activities, the better.
Another reaction is that the festivities detract from the event's
focus surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me personally, I don't care about BMX biking or
volleyball,'' said Sunny Garcia, a Hawaiian regarded as one of the
top surfers in the world. ``What I think is that it should only be
surfing. It's a surfing event, and it doesn't have to add
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 29, with other surfers similar in age, has a different
perspective than younger pro surfers. When Garcia became a pro
surfer, he wasn't guaranteed money at events. If he didn't advance
past trial heats, he didn't get paid. Plus, if he did advance, he
wasn't guaranteed a reasonable purse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started it was really hard,'' Garcia said. ``If you
came in 33rd, you'd get $300, and that probably wasn't enough for
groceries and a place to stay. It was very hard and stressful. A
lot of times everybody stayed in the same place, and you'd have the
rooms filled with people sleeping on the floors.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia paid his dues in professional surfing when there was
doubt he could make a substantial living. Now, if a young surfer
makes it to the WCT, the surfer is guaranteed money and won't have
to struggle like surfers from past years.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors have made prize money respectable, making a
career in surfing more feasible. An easy example to see how
corporate sponsors have changed the money situation on the WCT is
to look at Mark Occhilupo's prize earnings. Occhilupo, 34, has been
one of the world's top surfers for more than 13 years and is ranked
first in the WCT this year. His career prize money on the WCT is
approximately $350,000, and in 1997 alone, won $119,600. But with
the increasing prize money, pro surfing's culture may have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young surfers expect certain things,'' Garcia said.
``They don't cherish what they get, like we (older surfers) do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat O'Connell, 27, is another of the world's top surfers who
like Garcia, Occhilupo and the biggest names in surfing is expected
to compete at Huntington. O'Connell grew up in Laguna Niguel and
has seen the the sport's changes. When he was 12, he saw his first
pro surfing contest at Huntington Beach, so he has witnessed the
event's evolution.
</P>
<P>
   While the event at Huntington always has been considered the
biggest festival of the WCT, it continues to grow until this year
in which the crowd is expected to exceed 250,000. That large crowd
could help surfing grow, but perhaps only if the crowd focuses on
the surfing, which is not a given.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does feel a little strange to pull up to the beach and see
people on roller blades or on bikes,'' O'Connell said. ``But when
you get to into the water, it's just like any other event.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Simmons, 25, who attended Los Alamitos High and lives in
Seal Beach, also remembers seeing the pro surfing at Huntington
Beach as a child. Simmons competed in last week's U.S. Open of
Surfing and has seen many changes to pro surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineties beach culture has blown up, especially with
skateboarding and volleyball,'' Simmons said. ``It's all been in a
good way. I don't see any negatives to it.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of other beach sports could increase surfing's
popularity. And if the level of pro surfing is an indication, then
surfing is going in the right direction. Surfers agree that any of
the 45 competing in the Gotcha Pro could win the event. In past
years, only a handful of surfers would have a legitimate chance.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers who came on the scene in the early '90s, Rob Machado,
Shane Dorian, Tim Curran and Taylor Knox among others, are the
favorites for the Gotcha Pro. But then again, these surfers have
been favorites for close to a decade and likely will remain in that
position for years.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Malloy, a pro surfer from Ventura, pointed out that
surfboards were revolutionized in the early '90s to make them
lighter, stronger and more mobile. The surfers from the early '90s
took advantage of this and have remained on top ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still the strongest force out there,'' Malloy said.
``There are going to be younger guys, though. There always will be
young fresh guys who will turn heads. But it's those other guys who
have dominated and continue to dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   But with increased prize money, individuality has been called
into question. Young surfers have been accused of simply chase
purses, instead of the intangible goals of older surfers. Some say
young surfers' personalities are not distinctive, like those from
the past. If that's so, then perhaps it is a solid argument against
the direction that surfing is heading.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said, ``Everybody wants to be the next guy. Nobody wants
to be himself.''

SCHREMPF, FANS LOSE IN SONICS' LATEST EQUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Free agency in the NBA begins Sunday, so here's the
first question on your test to become a team general manager:
</P>
<P>
   Do you commit:
</P>
<P>
   a) $87 million to a superbly talented superstar who doesn't
practice and is also a pain to many of his teammates;
</P>
<P>
   b) $87 million to a superbly talented star who is fatter and
softer than ice cream on pumpkin pie;
</P>
<P>
   c) Offend your hardest working, most reliable player with a
potential offer of the minimum veteran's salary;
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above, then enroll in the Rancho Absurdo Sports
Executive Therapy Club (Woody Woodward, president).
</P>
<P>
   Sonics president Wally Walker apparently has chosen d),
establishing that his capacity for self-abuse is far greater than
previously credited.
</P>
<P>
   If Walker can create a serious playoff contender from that
choice, he not only will be executive of the year, the College of
Cardinals will have him next in line for the papacy.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's dilemma was outlined in remarks Tuesday by Detlef
Schrempf, choice c) in the question.
</P>
<P>
   In a broadcast interview, the free agent forward declared his
Sonics days over because he believes the club plans to offer him
only $1 million for a single year.
</P>
<P>
   While describing the potential offer as an insult caused
eyebrows to soar among grocery baggers across Puget Sound, the
possibility marks a substantial pay cut from his $3.3 million
salary last year. And that was a season when he was among the few
Sonics not to require a dietician, nurse and anger-management
counselor just to get through practice.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his 36 years, Schrempf was a stalwart in a
lockout-ruined season rife with incompetence and contempt. But
rather than be rewarded, Schrempf sees choice b), Vin Baker, likely
to receive from the Sonics the maximum contract allowable under the
new collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Baker last season was virtually the anti-Det _ undedicated,
unprofessional and timid. Even this summer's dalliance with the
U.S. team in the Olympic qualifying tournament in Puerto Rico
established he was still out of shape despite five months of nearly
constant basketball.
</P>
<P>
   That is not an easy accomplishment. Baker is a clear and present
danger to the world's supply of fries and milk shakes.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf also sees that choice a), Gary Payton, has been richly
rewarded and allowed to skip most practices, despite curiously
disappearing in some games and this summer attempting to dictate to
management about acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Since Schrempf doesn't much care for Payton anyway, the prospect
of returning to his hometown club under these developments has all
the appeal of Pennzoil shortcake.
</P>
<P>
   Although it isn't much of a surprise that the Sonics may end up
lowballing Schrempf _ nothing can happen until Sunday _ it is
another reminder of how cornered the Sonics are under the new labor
rules.
</P>
<P>
   With so much salary potentially committed to Payton, Baker and
newly acquired forward Horace Grant (about $24 million next year
alone), the Sonics must go light on the rest of the roster. They
can get away with that with youngsters Jelani McCoy, Vladimir
Stepania and Rashard Lewis, but the remaining six roster spots must
be filled by veterans willing to work relatively cheaply, at least
by NBA standards.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf claims he will not be among them, even though he said
repeatedly Tuesday his decision wasn't about money (wink, nudge).
But whether his reasons are financial or basketball, the system is
set up to squeeze the middle class of players where he resides.
</P>
<P>
   By renouncing the rights to Schrempf and five other free agents,
the Sonics could clear enough room under the salary cap to pursue a
high-end free agent such as Mitch Richmond. But his acquisition
would further top-load a roster that, along with Grant, would now
have two 34-year-olds on the downside of their careers receiving
huge multi-year deals.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the worst situation, but it does resemble the picture
painted last year by the Houston Rockets. While sporting three of
the 50 greatest players in NBA history, the salary-constrained
Rockets were forced to start two rookie guards to support Hakeem
Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Bad scene. One likely to be repeated here without the expertise
of Schrempf, whose versatility helped plug the talent hole of the
night. That virtue, little appreciated, will become more visible
next year when the Sonics are overloaded with either youth or
one-position players.
</P>
<P>
   A case can be made that Schrempf is too old to justify a larger
contract. It also could be argued that Walker, despite the flops of
Jim McIlvaine and Billy Owens, is due to hook a good one in free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   But jettisoning Schrempf eliminates any wiggle room the roster
had to absorb mistakes. And it puts much of the weight of the
franchise on the re-signing and the re-energizing of Baker.
</P>
<P>
   As if he needs the pounds.

BIG BEAR ATTRACTS BOXERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEAR LAKE -- They come from South Africa, New Zealand,
Mexico and Poland, from Oxnard, East Los Angeles, Pomona, Detroit
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   From near and far, prize fighters are flocking to this mountain
hideaway to train.
</P>
<P>
   The altitude, they believe, improves their endurance. The
solitude, they know, bolsters their psyche, keeping them out of
trouble and focused on business.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Bear boon started nine years ago with just one camp --
Larry Goossen's Boxing Gym. Local fighters like Gabe and Rafael
Ruelas became its mainstays. Today, Big Bear Lake, elevation 7,200
feet, has become boxing's training mecca.
</P>
<P>
   It's 9 a.m. on a summer morning. Francois Botha of South Africa
and Jesus Salud of Hawaii are chopping wood on what soon will be
the fourth training camp located here.
</P>
<P>
   This one belongs to Abel Sanchez. The West Covina native,
considered one of the game's top trainers, is building a camp with
two houses. The complex will also include an indoor pool and indoor
training center.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, the former IBF heavyweight champion, is training for his
Aug. 7 bout against Shannon Briggs.
</P>
<P>
   For one four-minute round after another, sweat pours down
Botha's bare chest. He relentlessly swings a lead-handled ax,
cutting into a gigantic tree trunk, wood chips flying up to 50 feet
away.
</P>
<P>
   It's Botha's first time here. He wishes it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was here (training for Mike Tyson),'' said Botha, who
was knocked out by Tyson last Jan. 17 in the fifth round. ``The
elevation is excellent. When I first time came here I couldn't chop
wood for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm up to an hour and fifteen minutes. Once you are up
here to train, you struggle at first. But then you get in shape.
Once you go down to lower level, your breathing is so much better.
If you can't get in shape in this altitude, you can't get in shape
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Oscar De La Hoya. That's why he's in great shape,
because he trains up here. Look how he finished against (Ike)
Quartey.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Goossen's Boxing Gym is now the Big Bear Boxing &AMP; Fitness
Gym. There is also Oscar De La Hoya's gym, and Emanuel Steward's
Kronk Gym West.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, Lennox Lewis, Shannon Briggs, Fernando Vargas,
``Sugar'' Shane Mosley, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Botha, Salud, Oba
Carr, Andrew Golota, Jimmy Thunder, Carlos Navarro, Roberto Garcia,
Orlin Norris, Miguel Angel Gonzalez, Lou Del Valle and Raul Marquez
are some of the marquee fighters who train here.
</P>
<P>
   Some are local. Many -- like New York's Briggs, Michigan's
Mayweather, England's Lewis, Poland's Golota, New Zealand's
Thunder, South Africa's Botha, Hawaii's Salud, Detroit's Carr and
Mexico's Gonzalez -- are not.
</P>
<P>
   They hear about high altitude training, about the serenity. And
they come to see if it's true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept hearing different things about fighters coming up
here: Oscar De La Hoya, Floyd Mayweather Jr.,'' said Briggs, of
Brownsville, N.Y., who has asthma. This is his first time training
in Big Bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hearing different stories and I had once trained for the
Olympics at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado. And I had felt
the difference once I went down. So I wanted to give this a shot.
Plus, I needed the solitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm not in Las Vegas, because those crap tables would
be calling my name. I'm happy I'm here. I love this town. It's a
beautiful place.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Woodworth, who manages several fighters who train here,
swears by the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone up for nearly 10 years,'' said Woodworth, who
manages Garcia, Norris, Felipe Campa, Israel Correa and Carlos
Madrigal, all of whom train here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal for me as a manager is you have isolation, number
one. There are not a lot of things to do to get in trouble up
there. When you have guys come to Vegas early in their careers,
there are a lot of temptations.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the altitude. With that kind of wind, the running and the
training, by the time you get back down to sea level you are going
to have more wind left in the championship rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   This, apparently, is debatable. De La Hoya and Vargas have
previously said the altitude is a supreme factor in training here,
as did every fighter interviewed for this story. Not everyone,
however, agrees on the positive effects of altitude training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong emphasis has been on altitude,'' said Steward, who
turned an old Army Surplus store in Big Bear into what is now Kronk
Gym West. Steward owns the original Kronk Gym in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one who doesn't believe in that,'' Steward said. ``If you
are fighting in high altitude, then I believe in it. But if you
don't, it doesn't do you any good. And how many times do you fight
in high altitude?
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you are in shape or you are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward offers proof. He said that for the second Riddick
Bowe-Evander Holyfield fight in November of 1993, Bowe trained in
high altitude. Holyfield did not. Holyfield won.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Evander went 12 beautiful rounds,'' Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first Thomas Hearns-Sugar Ray Leonard fight, Hearns
trained in high altitude and wilted in the later rounds. He trained
in Detroit for their second bout and floored Leonard in the 11th
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy Hearns trained up there a little bit and did not like
it,'' Steward said. ``He said driving up and down the mountains is
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Another famous trainer, Gil Clancy, said he believes altitude
training is beneficial, whatever the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I am only concerned with Oscar,'' said Clancy,
De La Hoya's assistant trainer to Roberto Alcazar. ``He has an
absolute perfect training camp. He has a home up there and he is
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is 8,000 feet above sea level, so it helps his stamina
when he gets down to sea level.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Steward's comments, Clancy said: ``This is one of the
few times I disagree with Emanuel. When you are training up there
in strenuous conditions, you still have to expand to get more
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when you get down, your lungs I think will provide you with
more oxygen than ordinary circumstances. I think it is the high
altitude. And I think that more and more guys are following Oscar's
lead. They see what it has done for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Oba Carr followed him here for his last
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr fought a tremendous fight against De La Hoya in May before
being stopped in the 11th round.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy isn't the only one who believes training at altitude is
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is probably to a certain extent so,'' said Dr.
Robert Karns, the former chief medical examiner for the California
State Athletic Commission. ``It is like climatizing yourself at a
higher altitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your oxygen-carrying capacity is increased. It's like skiing.
The first couple of days you don't feel so good (because of the
altitude).''
</P>
<P>
   Karns, however, said the benefits shrink if you are not actually
going to fight in altitude, giving credence to Steward's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are fighting in an area like that, you will do very
well,'' said Karns, who specializes in internal medicine and
cardiology. ``The boxers will have that advantage when they go down
to sea level, too. They probably have one or two more grams of
hemoglobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's call it a form of blood building. But it will dissipate
quickly. It really doesn't make all that much difference. Once you
are down there for about a week, it is gone. It would, however,
help you if you were to fight two days later.''
</P>
<P>
   Salud, the former WBA junior featherweight champ, isn't buying
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here the last six, seven years because of the high
altitude,'' Salud said. ``It makes a difference. When you go down
to the lower elevation, you got a lot of wind. And the atmosphere.
It is nice and quiet. It makes you concentrate more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who has trained seven world champions, said there is no
substitute for a strong mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solitude keeps them away from everyday life, the family,''
said Sanchez, a 1974 graduate of Edgewood High School in West
Covina. ``When they come up here they are coming up here for a
major fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the distractions are left at home. For them it seems to
work out better because they can sleep at night. They don't have to
worry about what the kids are doing, the neighbor, the fence fell
down, they gotta go fix a car.''

THREE TRAINING CAMPS RESIDE AT BIG BEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEAR LAKE -- When Larry Goossen opened the first training
camp here for boxers in 1990, it was located in a hangar at the Big
Bear Airport.
</P>
<P>
   He was booted out of it after eight months, but eventually
re-located at a 2,000 square-foot building that was designed to be
an auto repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough getting kicked out of there,'' Goossen said,
``but they said only airplanes belonged there.''
</P>
<P>
   Little did Goossen know that nine years later he would be in
Denver, training fighters out of his brother Dan's America Presents
stables.
</P>
<P>
   Today Big Bear is home to three training camps, with a fourth to
be completed in October. That means the tough buck Goossen was
earning running training camps for the likes of Riddick Bowe,
Michael Moorer and Michael Nunn has become even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Once word of mouth circulated about the solitude of training in
Big Bear, and the benefits of high altitude training, fighters
flocked to this mountain resort.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while. Oscar De La Hoya opened his gym in 1995.
Emanuel Steward opened his Kronk Gym West in 1997. And Abel Sanchez
completes his gym in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody started building gyms up there, so I said, `There
goes the honeymoon,' '' said Goossen, who sold part ownership of
Larry Goossen's Boxing Gym to Dr. Les Cohen, who three years ago
moved the camp next door and re-named it Big Bear Boxing &AMP; Fitness
Gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it is tough. The money is not as good.''
</P>
<P>
   For Goossen, who moved to Denver last September, running his gym
was his life's work. It was how he made his living. Now, he sits
and watches from 1,100 miles away, almost astonished at what has
transpired over nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked, to tell you the truth,'' he said. ``Because I
got so much negative response. People were saying, `How is that
going to work?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It worked because Goossen brought in world-class fighters. His
first camp was with Reggie Johnson, the former IBF light
heavyweight champ. He had Moorer, Bowe, Nunn, the Ruelas brothers
and even De La Hoya before De La Hoya built his gym.
</P>
<P>
   Things were so good the first few years, Goossen admittedly got
carried away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought summer would be really busy and winter would
be slower,'' Goossen said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Although some boxers who had never experienced a real
winter left once it hit, there was never a shortage of fighters
willing to pay the fee Goossen charged to train at his gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest problem was overbooking my camp (during the
winter),'' said Goossen, who grew up as part of the fighting
Goossen family in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got going, everybody wanted to go there. So instead of
running four camps, I would run six, seven, eight camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got greedy. From that point, it was bombardment. When winter
came around, I didn't even want to go up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Goossen leaves it to De La Hoya, Steward, Sanchez and Cohen
to duke it out.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya probably doesn't care how many people train at his
camp. It is private, and he only rents to a specific few, like his
buddy Raul Marquez, who was knocked out by Fernando Vargas on July
17.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez? The West Covina native said his camp will also be
private, but that it would be available to rent by any fighter who
can pay what figures to be an expensive fee.
</P>
<P>
   Steward is a smart businessman. He rents Kronk Gym West to more
fighters than any other camp.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis, Vargas, ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley, Shannon Briggs and
Lou Del Valle are just some of the marquee fighters who train at
Kronk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear on TV that this guy just came from camp in Big
Bear,'' Steward said. ``And then based on the high profile and
publicity they got, other fighters start to follow them up there.''
</P>
<P>
   They can have it all, Goossen said, because he is really a city
boy. Denver might not be L.A. or New York, but it is livelier than
Big Bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there,'' he said. ``It
was too damn small up there.''

SCHREMPF'S CAREER APPEARS OVER IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Calling the latest contract offer from the Sonics
``insulting,'' ``embarrassing'' and a ``slap in the face,'' Detlef
Schrempf left little hope he'll be wearing a Sonics jersey next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf made the comments to Dave Mahler of Seattle's Sports
Radio KJR-AM Tuesday morning. He was responding to questions about
published reports that he would rather retire or play for another
team than take the Sonics' $1 million offer to play next season. A
14-year veteran, Schrempf made $3.3 million this past season _ his
sixth with Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics cautioned Tuesday that they haven't renounced
Schrempf's rights and are still willing to negotiate. But team
officials conceded the lower offer is an option.
</P>
<P>
   A provision in the NBA's collective bargaining agreement allows
teams to sign a single free agent to a one-year, $1 million salary
exception when the club is at or above the salary cap. That option
would give the Sonics salary flexibility to sign a more expensive
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that's an insult,'' Schrempf said. ``It's not about the
money. I'm being told they really don't want me but they still want
to keep me for PR reasons, and that's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need that, and I'm not going to play for that. ...
I've paid my dues, and I feel like I deserve more respect than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonics president Wally Walker was in Boston Tuesday and
unavailable for comment. The team's vice president of basketball
operations, Billy McKinney, said because he didn't hear Schrempf's
broadcast comments he would rather not respond directly to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the comments are premature based on my understanding
of the situation,'' McKinney said. ``There are still a lot of
moving parts with free agency. Soon we should have a better idea
with the players we're talking to about free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any contract negotiations there will always be
something said either positive or negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf said he might be willing to play for the lower $1
million figure if Walker would guarantee another higher-paying
contract for the following year. However, the collective bargaining
agreement doesn't allow that kind of deal even under the guise of
an informal ``gentleman's handshake agreement.'''
</P>
<P>
   The popular former University of Washington player said he
doesn't expect any further Sonics offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically done,'' said Schrempf, whose 15 points, 7.4
rebounds and 3.7 assists per game were second best on the team last
season, behind only star guard Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf conceded he didn't expect a four-or five-year contract
but felt like Walker's offer forced him to make a big sacrifice for
the team with little personal gain in return.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf is among six Sonics players whose contracts have
expired. The team can renounce Sunday some or all free agents to
get below the salary cap. If it does not get below the salary cap,
under the Larry Bird exception, it may re-sign its own free agents
at any salary without regard to the cap.
</P>
<P>
   That precludes the team from pursuing another team's expensive
free agent, but it would allow the Sonics to pay Schrempf a salary
closer to what he made last year.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf also questioned why the Sonics wouldn't instead sign
him to a larger contract and trade him _ preferably to a West Coast
team. Schrempf mentioned Portland, Utah and San Antonio as
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Those options aside, Schrempf hinted at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need that kind of abuse,'' Schrempf said of the
Sonics' offer. ``I'd rather retire than play under those terms.''

BOXERS WELCOMED BY COMMUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEAR LAKE -- One store clerk says boxers help the economy in
this community.
</P>
<P>
   A fast-food restaurant employee was saddened that the gym being
built by Abel Sanchez resulted in 28 trees being chopped down.
</P>
<P>
   But all in all, the estimated 50 boxers training here at a given
time don't have a huge impact on the community, says Connie Baker,
publicist for Big Bear Resort Association, an arm of the Big Bear
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight contender Shannon Briggs recently visited Bear
Necessities, a health food store here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady told me that boxers are good for the economy,''
Briggs said. ``That's good. People are finally saying something
positive about boxers.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Linda Fares, an employee at Bear Necessities: ``More and
more, boxers are training here. I think it is good. I think they
are a boon to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are nice gentlemen. Their trainers are nice gentlemen.
They are also very aware of what they put into their bodies. They
are probably more knowledgeable about what they put into their
bodies than two-thirds of the people up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker understands how some of the retailers affected by boxers
training here could react this way. But the ``boon'' Fares spoke of
is not across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly think that for somebody who handles
supplements, that is a valid statement,'' she said. ``An athlete in
training is going to be more likely to choose their services.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you have somewhere around 120 to 150 people --
including trainers and camp members -- doing what every other
resident is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, they rent a camp, or they go to the supermarkets,
the local pub, the theaters, gas stations,'' Baker said. ``Their
impact is more like that of the resident community.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, however, did say that Oscar De La Hoya created something
for residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly from the standpoint that Oscar De La Hoya has made
Big Bear one of his homes has made an awareness for Big Bear,'' she
said. ``He said the quality of community and high altitude was very
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he could still go to L.A. for everything else he does.
When Kronk was established, that certainly added to it. It has
become more of a local awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are there as much as I am, we see the people
training. They are not your usual jogger. You are aware that
someone is running down the street, semi-jogging or skipping
rope.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said chances are many residents have no idea that by
October the area will be home to four boxing training camps.
</P>
<P>
   But one Carl's Jr. employee knows only too well. Sanchez's gym
is being built about 100 feet behind the fast-food hamburger joint,
which is located on Big Bear Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty mad at him because he cut down 28 trees,'' the
cashier said. ``But he's a nice man, so we forgave him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sanchez must re-plant 14 of those trees upon
completion of his camp, expected by October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an issue,'' Baker said. ``If we end up with a bare city
surrounded by forest, there is no charm. It is important we protect
it.''

ROYALS RECALL SEATTLE-NATIVE FOR SERIES AGAINST HOMETOWN TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Glendon Rusch had a question: ``Is Jamie
Moyer pitching this series?''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals left-hander from North Seattle was told
that Moyer had pitched the finale of the Mariners' last series and
won't face the Royals this week. That's too bad for Rusch, a
Shorecrest High product who models himself after the Mariners
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch was recalled from Class AAA Omaha before Tuesday night's
game, and will take his place in the Royals bullpen. The
24-year-old found himself back in the minors this year after
spending the last two seasons in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game is fastball and changeup,'' Rusch said. ``I need to
have command like Moyer does to be able to throw both pitches in
and out and keep it down in the zone. I wasn't able to do that, and
that's what hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusch was 6-9 in '97, 6-15 last year and failed to make the
Royals out of spring training this season. He was 3-6 with a 4.02
earned run average at Omaha, allowing 100 hits in 781/3 innings.
But he had improved in recent starts and was promoted when the
Royals optioned left-hander Tim Byrdak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're down at a lower level, and you're struggling
there, then you feel like the organization's looking down on you,
saying, `If he's struggling there, what's he going to do here?'''
Rusch said. ``That can weigh on your mind. It's almost a no-win
situation down there, unless you're producing and doing well. But I
just tried to keep the best positive attitude I could and get back
here as soon as possible. I'm happy to be back, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusch was so happy, he left Omaha as soon as he got the call,
arriving in Kansas City at 2 a.m. Tuesday. He was rushing so he
could finally sleep in his own bed _ Rusch bought a home in
Overland Park, Kan., after the 1997 season and lives there
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   He's looking forward to the Royals' trip to Safeco Field in
September, especially because he was injured when Omaha played at
Tacoma and hasn't been back home in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You miss the scenery there, the mountains and the trees,''
Rusch said. ``You get out here, and you hardly even have a hill.
But as much as I like it out there, I like it here a lot, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A-ROD SCRATCHED: Shortstop Alex Rodriguez missed Tuesday's game
with a sore left wrist, the result, he said, of a check-swing and a
slide in Sunday's win at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first game Rodriguez has missed since returning from
his knee injury in mid-May. He was available only to pinch-run and
play defense Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just woke up and it was aggravated,'' Rodriguez said after
the game. ``But I should be all right to play tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   OH, HENRY? The Mariners aren't counting on him, but left-hander
Butch Henry still plans to return sometime next month. He's hoping
to provide some stretch-drive help to a team that is short on
left-handers just three days before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're by no means out of it,'' Henry said. ``Those games in
August and September are going to be real important. If I can get
back and help us win one or two or five or six games, that's
something. That's what I'm shooting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who has been throwing lightly for most of this month,
threw 20 pitches off a mound Tuesday. It was the first time he had
thrown off a mound since tearing the labrum in his throwing
shoulder in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just interested in getting back to help the team that's
been paying me all year long,'' said Henry, who was 2-0 in four
starts before the injury. ``I've said August all along, and that's
what I've got my sights set on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: Game-time temperature was 93 degrees at
Kauffman Stadium Tuesday night, with 100 degrees in the forecast
for today's matinee. ... Kauffman Stadium is the only American
League park in which Alex Rodriguez has played in but not hit a
home run. He has homered in 19 of the 21 parks in which he has
played, including four of five National League parks. The lone NL
park in which he's gone homerless is Dodger Stadium. ... Rodriguez
turned 24 years old Tuesday.

PEREZ TO MINORS; DODGERS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the second straight day, the Dodgers lost to
Cincinnati 5-3 in 10 innings Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium as
they collapsed again in extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise here. The Dodgers are 3-8 in extra-inning games and
lost this one when the Reds' only hit in the 10th went about 15
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers reliever Alan Mills (2-4) walked a pair of Reds before
Aaron Boone's basehit bunt loaded the bases, then he walked Chris
Stynes to give the Reds the lead 4-3 in the 10th. Mark Lewis added
a sacrifice fly. The Reds have won four straight games in their
final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, anything that takes place on the field doesn't
seem to matter much.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the talk afterward was about left-handed pitcher Carlos
Perez being optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque, where he's expected
to make at least four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Also, recently benched second baseman Eric Young had MRIs done
on his ailing hamstring and ankle. Trainer Charlie Strasser said
results should be available today.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Perez's demotion is based on
the lefty not being able to regain his stuff pitching out of the
bullpen. The Dodgers needed to clear a roster spot for right-hander
Robinson Checo, who starts tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would serve (Perez) better than pitching out of the
bullpen,'' Johnson said. ``We just don't feel he can get it back
pitching out of the pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's demotion was expected, but it paints an even uglier
picture on his season. Perez, who declined comment, signed a
three-year, $15.5 million guaranteed contract with the Dodgers in
the offseason. In response, he was 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA. He also
missed one start with a mysterious knee injury in Montreal, and it
was widely reported he was injured while out late the night before
a start.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 27, also bashed a water cooler in the Dodgers' dugout
after another horrific outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel, (pitching coordinator Jim) Benedict's there, he has a
history with Carlos, and we feel that will benefit him,'' Johnson
said. ``Maybe he'll make four starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Young saga continues. The recently benched second
baseman wants to go on the disabled list and could have his wish
granted based on the MRI. Young, who is complaining of a sore
hamstring, was examined by team doctors before the game. Young
wants to go on the disabled list so he can rest his ailing legs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers don't want to place Young on the disabled list
because baseball rules prohibit trading a player on the DL, and the
Dodgers have been actively shopping him the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' Young said. ``They'll know more
(today). That's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the confusing matter of whether the Dodgers will
trade first baseman Eric Karros or one of the starting pitchers.
The latest club to enter into talks about possibly acquiring Karros
is Toronto, in desperate need of right-handed power in order to
make a push for the wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   There's also discussions ongoing between the Reds and Dodgers
concerning L.A. right-hander Ismael Valdes for either reliever
Danny Graves or Scott Williamson and a minor-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that deal happening might have improved with Mark
Grudzielanek's seventh-inning single. Grudzielanek lined a two-out
pitch off Brett Tomko's right hand, knocking the right-hander from
the game. It came after Todd Hundley tied the score 3-3 on a solo
homer earlier in the inning, his 15th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the uncertainty that can only worsen until
Saturday's trading deadline, there was actually a game. Chan Ho
Park left trailing 3-2. He allowed an RBI single to Mike Cameron in
the first, one to Michael Tucker in the third and a run-scoring
single to Stynes in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth's sacrifice fly in the fourth accounted for
the Dodgers' first run and Devon White singled in a run in the
bottom of the sixth to pull the Dodgers within 3-2. &QL;

 POLICE NOW BELIEVE HANDYMAN'S SOLO-KILLER TALE  &HT;     By STACY FINZ, JAXON VAN DERBEKEN and SUSAN SWARD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Law enforcement officials said Tuesday that they
now have independent evidence supporting a motel maintenance man's
confession that he acted alone in the February killings of three
Yosemite tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Stayner, 37, is charged with last week's decapitation
killing of naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong. Authorities are now
building a case to charge Stayner with the slayings of Carole Sund,
42, her 15-year-old daughter Julie and their 16-year-old friend
Silvina Pelosso. The three visited Yosemite in February and were
last seen alive at the Cedar Lodge _ the motel where Stayner worked
as a fix-it man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good sense of what happened,'' said Tuolumne County
Deputy District Attorney Timothy Clancy. Investigators now have
specific details about how the three were marked for death, killed
and how their bodies were disposed.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the growing body of evidence, investigators have
documented a taxi ride Stayner took after two of the bodies were
dumped. They also said Stayner had information about the weapons
used and the condition of the crime scene _ details only the killer
would know.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators disclosed new information about
Armstrong's death, saying she struggled mightily with her attacker.
``She put up a fight,'' said one source close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner told the FBI and a television reporter that he has
dreamed of tormenting and killing women since he was a young boy.
Speaking to a reporter for stations KNTV in San Jose and KBWB in
San Francisco on Monday night, Stayner said he strangled Carole
Sund and Silvina Pelosso in their motel room in El Portal, just
outside Yosemite's western border. Then he took Julie Sund to a
lake, where he killed her. He did not say how he picked the women
as victims, but swore that he did not torture or sexually assault
them. Authorities would not confirm that information.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner says he took the bodies of Silvina Pelosso and Carole
Sund in their rental car to a secluded spot about 50 miles away in
Long Barn. Stayner then called a cab to take him back to El Portal.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Horvath, co-owner and driver for Courtesy Cab Co. in
Sonora, remembered the $125 fare the moment she saw his picture in
the news. She had picked him up from the Sierra Village Market,
near Long Barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really tired, worn out, he hadn't shaved in a couple of
days,'' she said Tuesday, recalling that he was carrying just a
backpack and told her he had been stranded after coming to the area
with some friends who left without him. He needed to get back to
his job, doing rewiring work in the park, he told her. But at the
gate, he preferred to pay the visitor's fee rather than reveal who
he worked for, she said. Workers are exempt from the fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of creepy,'' she said. ``That's why I usually drive
during the day, because of things like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Horvath said she and her husband were interviewed by FBI agents
during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the cab ride, Stayner says, he returned to Long
Barn to burn evidence and retrieve Carole Sund's wallet, which he
then dumped in Modesto to confuse authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The car was found a month later. Julie Sund was discovered a few
days after that on the banks of Lake Don Pedro _ her head nearly
severed from her body. Sources say Stayner has taken credit for a
letter mailed to the FBI, tipping them to the exact location of the
teenager's body.
</P>
<P>
   The letter is now being analyzed to determine whether it was
indeed sent by Stayner, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   But they believe that he knows too much about the crime and that
there is too much evidence to back up his statements for him not to
be the killer, said one source close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official, Stayner knew information about what
was taken from the sightseers' motel room and about the conditions
of the bodies. Stayner also knew that knives were used in the
killings, a detail that has not been released to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Even though officials initially had a hard time believing that
Stayner overcame three women on his own and was able to drop their
rental car in Long Barn by himself, they have now come to the
conclusion that he is telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we now know how the transportation occurred,''
Clancy said of how the tourists' rental car was driven to the
wooded area and the killer was able to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, fond of sunbathing in the nude, was arrested Saturday
at a clothing optional resort near Sacramento. Clancy said local
prosecutors will probably prosecute the handyman in the
Sund/Pelosso case. Clancy is scheduled to meet with Mariposa County
prosecutors later this week to discuss when they will file charges
against Stayner and which county will try the case. The U.S.
attorney's office will try Stayner for Armstrong's slaying, because
she was killed in a national park.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the farm town of Merced, Stayner is the older brother
of Steven Stayner, who was abducted on his way home from school in
December 1972 and sexually abused by his kidnapper for more than
seven years. He escaped in March 1980 and was reunited with his
family, only to be killed nine years later in a motorcycle crash at
age 24.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators interviewed Stayner about the time the three
tourists were reported missing but excluded him as a potential
suspect. Agents believed that several people were involved in the
killings and were focusing on two half brothers from Modesto. One
of the brothers admitted to authorities that he played a role in
the killings. And acrylic blanket fibers found on the bodies
matched fibers found in the men's cars _ leading investigators to
believe they were on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   Now they don't know what to make of the matching fibers,
believing that it may have been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, a Fresno grand jury has been listening to testimony
about the half brothers and an assortment of their drug associates.
But no charges were ever filed.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the FBI is saying that the half brothers are still
being investigated to determine whether there is a link.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are still being evaluated,'' said Tron Brekke,
deputy assistant director of the FBI. ``No one is being ruled out.
We don't base our cases on what subjects say _ we base them on the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stanislaus County Public Defender Tim Bazar, who represents
one of the brothers, said the FBI should leave his client alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have, and never did have, any real evidence to
connect (him) or anyone else (in the group) to the crime _ even
though they kept making the bold statement that they were confident
they had the killer behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Bazar said the fiber evidence was dubious at best. Acrylic
blankets are very common and ``you know, heck, ... you probably
have some fibers on you right now from an acrylic blanket,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense attorney said the FBI and police may have focused on
his client out of sheer desperation to solve the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to wait and hear their explanation for that,'' he
said. ``I suppose the one thing they could have done is announced
publicly that they didn't have anything and still needed the
public's help. But they didn't do that. They told everybody the
killers were in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bazar said his client continues to cooperate with authorities
and has been interviewed three times, one interview taking place
after Armstrong's body was found several hundred feet from her
Yosemite cabin about four miles from the Cedar Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Armstrong's grieving mother spoke publicly for the
first time since she was notified of her daughter's death Thursday
night. ``Joie was phenomenal _ she rose to every occasion,'' Leslie
Armstrong said.

TRACKING KUBLA KHAN'S DINING CAR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I worked on the railroad once, and the term for lunch break was
``go to beans,'' and we bought snacks from the ``bean wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Railroaders in Berkeley are hipper. They do drive-by takeout
from Xanadu, a cutting-edge Asian restaurant in what was once a
train station.
</P>
<P>
   Freight trains chuff past several times a day. Last week, a
patron of a nearby pub parked his car on the tracks and an SP train
bashed into it, as trains will do to cars. While the crew was
waiting for the mess to be cleared, Xanadu owner George Chen
invited the lads in for a bite.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later the Xanadu phone rang. It was the same train
crew, ordering take-out. But it's against train rules to make
unauthorized stops, unless there's a car on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   No, George Chen didn't run out and park a car on the tracks. He
bagged the food and stood trackside as the train approached and
slowed. A crewperson jumped off the engine, gave George a handful
of cash, took the chow and hopped back on.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the story of Berkeley's mu shu choo-choo.
</P>
<P>
   THE NFL is proud of its marketing, but one strange little side
effect is that bad guys like the logo stuff, and it seems like
every time a mass murderer gets arrested, there's a news photo of
him in wearing an NFL team cap or shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle ran a photo of confessed murderer Cary Stayner,
taken in '90 after his uncle was ``mysteriously'' murdered. Cary is
wearing a 49ers cap.
</P>
<P>
   Bad timing. The 49ers just signed a convicted woman-beater,
their in-limbo owner once settled a lawsuit that accused him of
beating a woman, and the backup quarterback was recently tried for
rape, and although declared innocent, evidence indicated behavior
unbecoming a quarterback and a gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   Sure makes it hard for a 49ers fan to make fun of the Dallas
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   LET'S PUT new 49er running back Lawrence Phillips' past behind
him, fine. And let's not nitpick everything he says.
</P>
<P>
   But ... at his welcoming press conference, Phillips talked of
the time he'd been bounced out of pro football as a bad guy and a
lousy player and he was sitting home watching games on TV and no
teams were calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most humbling experience I had,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Not the arrest for beating up a college woman and dragging her
by her hair down several flights of stairs. Not the arrest for
punching a woman in a nightclub because she wouldn't dance with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope those moments are fairly high on Phillips' Top Ten
humbling-experiences list.
</P>
<P>
   BUT PHILLIPS doesn't have a corner on the strange-statements
market. Take the FBI, please.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as Moe Edelstein points out, James Maddock, head of
the FBI in Sacramento, said, ``We have no reason to believe there
is a continuing threat (in Yosemite). I have reason to believe that
there's a killer loose somewhere, but I don't believe the killer is
planning another crime.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; We have tapped into the killer's subconscious mind; now we're &LR; 
 &UR; trying to get his name and address. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AND WHY, wonders Solomon Fisher, did the FBI say there appeared
to be no link between the killing of Joie Armstrong and the murders
of three tourists?
</P>
<P>
   Last seen near Yosemite ... Young women ... Bodies dumped ...
Decapitation ... Nope, no links there.
</P>
<P>
   AS THE OLD saying goes, I never repeat gossip, so listen
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   The Spreckels Mansion in Pacific Heights, now owned by Danielle
Steel, is for sale. Top prospect to buy the manse: John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   And A Source reports that the Russian River has become a magnet
for very attractive male and female hookers, specifically near the
Bohemian Grove encampment. Source wonders, ``Republicans looking
for their own Monicas?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   WELCOME TO San Francisco, where we beg you not to make the
offhand comment, ``There oughtta be a law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A can for every butt,'' that's our new motto. Mabel Teng's
sidewalk ashtray law passed the supervisors, 9 to 2 (``Leno, Newsom
Soft on Butts''), and now we need a law to fine bar and restaurant
owners who let their butt cans runneth over.
</P>
<P>
   We have no place to park our cars, but at least now everyone
will have a place to park his or her butt.
</P>
<P>
   It's an OK law, as laws go, but the bottom (so to speak) line on
the butt problem: We're a bunch of lazy slobs.
</P>
<P>
   ONE OF THE perks of big-league baseball fame is you get to
choose your own walk-on music, the snippet of song played over the
PA system as you stroll from the on-deck circle to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Giants' shortstop Rich Aurilia, for instance, picked the Beastie
Boys' ``No Sleep Till Brooklyn,'' Rich being a Brooklyn dude.
Charlie Hayes likes Ice Cube's ``We Be Clubbin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds may have changed his tune since the recent flare-up
of his old prenup battle with his former wife. But Barry's walk-on
theme is Puff Daddy's ``Mo Money Mo Problems.''
</P>

   Tell me about it, Barrissimo.

   1. THE BEAT GOES ON FOR CHER Over the years, Cher has zoomed to
musical heights and plummeted to the bottom, but she is
philosophical about it. ``If I had my choice of the two places, the
top is better. But for me, it doesn't change who I am,'' she says.
Currently the roller coaster is at a peak with the phenomenal
success of ``Believe.'' By Jim Sullivan. From The Boston Globe.

WHY THE DVD IS HERE TO STAY It seems that every time a new video
technology emerges, it is announced as the greatest advance since
Al Jolson destroyed the silent film with the immortal words ``You
ain't heard nothin' yet'' in 1927's ``The Jazz Singer.'' Digital
versatile disc (DVD,) a format destined to replace VHS, is
fulfilling the promise. While there are still only about 4,000
titles available - in contrast to nearly 68,000 VHS tapes - the DVD
is setting a faster sales pace than VHS. By Michael Blowen. From
The Boston Globe. 1,500 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
SEASON OF THE 'WITCH' On October 21, 1984, three young people hiked
into Maryland's Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary film on a
local legend, ``The Blair Witch.'' They were never heard from
again. One year later, their footage was found. Now you can see it
yourself at a cinema near you. Or can you? Five young Florida
filmmakers are currently riding a surprising wave of intrigue and
interest, concerning their first film, ``The Blair Witch Project,''
which cleverly blurs the line between fiction and reality. By
Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,300 words + photo.

PHIL COLLINS HELPS 'TARZAN' SWING
Singer/musician/songwriter/producer - and occasional actor - Phil
Collins - has released eight multimillion-selling solo albums, plus
another half dozen during his years with the band Genesis. But even
he is awed by the scale of his latest project, five songs for the
Walt Disney Co.'s new animated feature, ``Tarzan.'' ``It has the
potential to be vast - and I don't necessarily mean in financial
terms, just in terms of the kind of audience it can reach once
these things get on a roll,'' Collins says. By Gary Graff. 1,000

   5. ROGER DALTREY : A ROCK 'N ROLL SURVIVOR LOOKS BACK When
singer/actor Roger Daltrey, a pop icon since his days with The Who,
was asked to play an aging rock superstar with serious problems
with drinking and drugs, he hesitated. ``It was a bit too close to
home for me,'' he says. Finally he accepted the role of Nobby
Clegg, an English rocker with serious drink and drugs problems, in
the TV series ``Rude Awakening.'' At 55, Daltrey is one of a
handful of survivors who seem to have emerged more or less intact
from the cauldron of sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. By Ivor Davis.

THE GREAT AND NOT-SO-TERRIBLE OZ ON 'STAR WARS,'
</P>
<P>
   YODA AND JAR JAR BINKS Beyond providing the syntax-challenged
croak of The Force's guiding light in ``Star Wars : The Phantom
Menace,'' Frank Oz also manipulated the Yoda puppet, with
assistance from three fellow puppeteers. He honed his puppeteering
skills under Muppetmaster Jim Henson and is still the voice and
hands behind ``Sesame Street'' and Muppet favourites such as Miss
Piggy, Bert, Cookie Monster and Fozzie Bear. ``The challenge is
taking myself and the other people working the character and
rehearsing for days before we shoot, to get all of our movements
right,'' says Oz. By Ian Spelling. 1,300 words + photo.

GHOST STORY : JAN DE BONT DIRECTS 'THE HAUNTING' Jan de Bont, the
high-powered, Dutch-born director of the ``Speed'' films and
``Twister'' says making his kind of movie is very hard and not
always a lot of fun because there's a lot more pressure from the
studio and it's nerve-wracking to get them done. De Bont is back
with another emotional roller-coaster ride for the audience : ``The
Haunting,'' a $75 million horror film. The aural element is very
important in the film. ``It's not only what you can't see, but what
you can hear and can't see that can scare you,'' he says. ``It's
quite often the smallest sound that starts the imagination going.''

ALICEA SPARKS RANGERS TO NINTH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Texas Rangers general manager Doug Melvin created a
petty fuss among several of his peers in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some within the industry found it absurd that the Rangers
committed nearly $5.5 million over the course of the 1998 and 1999
seasons to reserves Luis Alicea and Roberto Kelly. Yet, those
investments continue to reap dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea replaced injured right fielder Juan Gonzalez in the
lineup and drove in three runs for the white-hot Rangers, who won
their ninth consecutive game Tuesday night with an 8-6 victory
against the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any good ballclub has to have a good bench,'' said
left fielder Rusty Greer, whose two-out, two-run double in the
second inning gave the Rangers a 4-2 lead. ``The bench on our club
has a tough job. They don't play regularly with the guys we've got.
They play once in awhile, and they do a great job of performing the
way they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicea learned only minutes before the game that Gonzalez
(strained ligaments, right wrist) would not be available. Rangers
manager Johnny Oates juggled his lineup and placed second baseman
Mark McLemore in right field, and Alicea replaced McLemore at
second base.
</P>
<P>
   The first pitch Alicea saw from Orioles right-hander Mike
Mussina (13-5) resulted in a two-run, game-tying homer in the
second inning. His second plate appearance produced a third-inning
sacrifice fly ball that scored third baseman Todd Zeile and gave
the Rangers a 5-2 lead against Baltimore's Mussina, arguably one of
the American League's three best starting pitchers this season
along with Boston's Pedro Martinez and New York's David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this has been an atypical season in terms of production for
Alicea, a quality reserve who entered Tuesday night's game hitting
.165 (17-for-103).
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be there when it matters, though,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``Plus, he does all the little things that don't
show up in the box score. We're very fortunate to have Luis Alicea
and Roberto Kelly in this organization. There are a lot of clubs
out there who would love to have them as starters.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Aaron Sele (10-6) pitched into the seventh inning
to join the league's short list of 10-game winners, and the bullpen
allowed only one run over the final three innings when closer John
Wetteland surrendered a ninth-inning, solo home run to Orioles
center fielder Brady Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who allowed eight hits, took a 7-3 lead into the seventh
inning before losing steam. Sele issued a leadoff walk to catcher
Charles Johnson, the Orioles' No. 9 hitter, and then fell behind in
the count to Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson eventually pummeled a 3-1 fastball for the first of his
two home runs, and that pulled the Orioles within two runs.
Left-hander Mike Venafro and right-hander Jeff Zimmerman, though,
slammed the door there by pitching two scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Rangers not only extended their winning steak, but the
victory snapped the Orioles' six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing well right now,'' said Alicea, who fielded all
five of chances in the field cleanly and was involved in one double
play. ``Every facet of our team is doing well. Everything is going
right.'' nn

WRIST AILING RANGERS' GONZALEZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Right fielder Juan Gonzalez will undergo a magnetic
resonance imaging test once the Rangers return to Texas should the
discomfort in his right wrist persist, trainer Danny Wheat said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez removed himself from the lineup Tuesday night after
experiencing more discomfort during batting practice and remains
day-to-day. Gonzalez injured the wrist Friday while sliding into
third base. X-rays taken then revealed no fracture, but Gonzalez
strained ligaments in the wrist, Wheat said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez returned to the lineup Sunday after missing Saturday's
game and was examined again Monday in Cooperstown, N.Y., by Dr.
John Conway, the Rangers' orthopedic consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore replaced Gonzalez in right field,
and reserve infielder Luis Alicea replaced McLemore as the second
baseman. DECLINING INTEREST RATE
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' level of interest in Orioles right-hander Juan
Guzman appears to be declining.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles plan to start Guzman (5-8, 4.21 earned-run average)
tomorrow against the Rangers, but general manager Doug Melvin, who
accompanied the team to Baltimore, does not plan to stay for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen him enough,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman, who will earn $5 million this season and can become a
free agent this winter, remains the subject of trade speculation.
Nevertheless, Melvin did not meet Tuesday with Orioles general
manager Frank Wren.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin plans to travel to Pulaski, Va., tomorrow and spend two
days there to evaluate the Rangers' rookie-league affiliate in the
Appalachian League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been to Pulaski in the two years they've been with
us,'' Melvin said, ``and I'd like to see our rookies.'' BELLE
REJECTS KRLD
</P>
<P>
   Orioles right fielder Albert Belle rejected a request to be the
guest for the Rangers' pregame radio show during this three-game
series in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Belle, Albert's brother and business manager, informed
KRLD's Eric Nadel through an e-mail that ``Albert really wants to
focus on the games at hand and just doesn't have time in his
schedule for an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadel informed the Belles that the interview would require only
four or five minutes and among the topics to be discussed included
Albert's charitable contributions. Nadel also informed the Belles
of their willingness to do the interview and any time and that it
would be broadcast by the Rangers' radio network, which includes an
affiliate in Shreveport, La., Belle's hometown. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Luis Alicea snapped two streaks with his two-run,
second-inning home run off right-hander Mike Mussina Tuesday night.
It was Alicea's first home run since Sept. 22, 1998, and the first
of his career against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   _ U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno attended Tuesday night's game
and sat in the stands with four secret-service agents. nn

STARS RE-SIGN YOUNG WINGERS MARSHALL, WRIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After saying goodbye during this off-season to veterans Pat
Verbeek, Craig Ludwig and Dave Reid, the Dallas Stars have given
new contracts to restricted free-agents Grant Marshall and Jamie
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Stars general manager Bob Gainey said Tuesday the club had
signed Marshall to a three-year deal and Wright to a one-year pact.
Financial terms were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, a physical right winger, suffered a severe groin
injury that sidelined him for all six games of the Stanley Cup
Finals win over the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall, a four-year veteran, established personal
career-high marks in the regular season with 13 goals and 31 points
while playing on an effective third line with Mike Keane and Guy
Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, 29, also set highs for game-winning goals with four
and shots taken with 112. He was fourth on the team in penalty
minutes with 85. He has 37 goals, 89 points and 390 penalty minutes
in his four seasons with the Stars, covering 282 games.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall also proved durable, playing in every regular season
game last season, becoming the only Stars player to do so. He added
three assists in the postseason, all in the Western Conference
semifinals against the St. Louis Blues. He played in 14 playoff
games.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a 23-year-old left winger, appeared in 11 games for the
Stars last season and didn't score. He has appeared in 32 games for
the Stars over two seasons, scoring four goals and six points.

<P>
   A Stars' fourth-round selection in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, he
spent most of last season with the Kalamazoo (Mich.) K-Wings in the
International Hockey League. There, he totaled 16 goals, 15 assists
and 92 penalty minutes. He will be given a chance to make the
Stars' 24-man roster. nn

VOLS HEAR CALL TO WIN TITLE AGAIN

<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Tee Martin remembers getting asked while
making a flight connection in New Orleans. Phillip Fulmer remembers
being asked 10 minutes after Tennessee had defeated Florida State
to win the 1998 national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you repeat?''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a nice question to face for a quarterback, a coach,
a program. The Volunteers' quest to win back-to-back national
championships was a hot topic Tuesday during the Southeastern
Conference football media days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew to New Orleans from Arizona, and when I got off the
plane somebody asked, `Can we do it again?' '' said Martin, a
senior quarterback who is 13-0 as a starter. ``I said, `Man, let me
enjoy this one first.' They're demanding at Tennessee. The put
pressure on you to perform. I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer said that, soon after his team's 23-16 victory against
the Seminoles in the Fiesta Bowl, he was being asked during his
postgame radio show about redshirt freshmen and who would figure in
plans for this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the `Coach, are we going to do it again?' a lot,'' he
said Tuesday. ``Our players know they have a target on their backs,
but I really don't think it's that much different from years
past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers, ranked No. 2 or No. 3 in most preseason polls,
return 14 starters. They should be especially strong at running
back and on the lines. However, Fulmer must replace middle
linebacker Al Wilson, the defensive leader, and big-play wide
receiver Peerless Price.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee opens the season Sept. 4 at home against Wyoming. The
Volunteers face SEC road challenges at Florida, Alabama and
Arkansas, plus a nonconference home game against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential to be better than last year's team,''
Martin said. ``We've just got to go out and do it. I think this
team is still humble. We're ready to go work hard and get dirty.''
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Arkansas coach Houston Nutt said his coaching staff made an
off-season visit to Michigan to study the Wolverines' program.
``They've got three offensive lines, three defensive lines,'' Nutt
said. ``They're doing drills, and the coaches just say, `Next.'
That's a good word for a coach. That means you've got depth. We
want to get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia sophomore quarterback Quincy Carter, who has played in
the Chicago Cubs' minor-league system as a right fielder,
questioned his future with the Cubs. ``I check out their games to
see how their right fielder (Sammy Sosa) is doing,'' Carter said
with a smile. ``That guy is going to be there for five, 10 years. I
don't think I'm going to be playing right field in Wrigley Field.
Maybe they'll move me to left.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Said LSU coach Gerry DiNardo: ``We're expanding our stadium to
91,600 in 2000. So, we'll have another 10,000 coordinators.'' nn

STOERNER CAN'T ELUDE MEMORY OF FUMBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ It wasn't a brain-dead triple bogey to lose a
major golf championship. It wasn't a grounder through the legs to
lose a World Series. All Clint Stoerner's Big Mistake did was
change the course of last year's college football season.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas was leading top-ranked Tennessee, 24-22, in Knoxville,
Tenn. The Razorbacks had the ball and were 1:43 away from going 9-0
and landing feet first in the national championship race.
</P>
<P>
   Then Stoerner, a junior who threw for a school record 2,629
yards and 26 touchdowns, stumbled on a roll out. As he fell, he
fumbled. Tennessee recovered, drove for the winning points and went
on to win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   All Stoerner has is a lifelong memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play, I don't think I'll ever be allowed to forget it, by
myself or anybody else,'' Stoerner said in the middle of an
interview huddle Tuesday during Southeastern Conference football
media days. ``It's the biggest play, from the negative side, I've
ever been a part of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get mad at you guys for asking the question. I'm
comfortable talking about it. In football, bad things come along
with the good things.''
</P>
<P>
   For Arkansas, the good thing was an unexpected turnaround. The
Razorbacks, 4-7 in 1997, were picked to finish last in the SEC
West. Instead, under first-year coach Houston Nutt, Arkansas rode
its 8-0 start to a 9-3 finish that included a trip to the Citrus
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner, a 6-2, 210-pound senior from Baytown Lee (Texas) High
School, leads an offense that returns its leading rusher, passer
and top five receivers. Seven starters return on defense. This
season, the Razorbacks are predicted to battle Alabama for the SEC
West Division title.
</P>
<P>
   But the memory of The Fumble is casting a shadow over the 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to get away from,'' Stoerner said. ``Right
after it happened, it seemed like it popped up every week. I'm a
big fan of ``SportsCenter'' and I was happy to be on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner has turned his link with infamy into a positive. Nutt
said that in his first season he noticed the Razorbacks were
national champions in the blame game. Stoerner is evidence that is
no longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had guys who would say, `I confess, it's your fault,' ''
Nutt said, crossing his arms and pointing his fingers in opposite
directions. ``What I loved about Clint in that situation, (after
the fumble) was that he stepped up in front of all those
microphones and said, `It was my fault' over and over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner's fumble was Tennessee's greatest escape in a
championship season that included narrow victories against
Syracuse, Florida and Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 20, 21 years old, and to have something like that
happen, I can feel his pain,'' Volunteers quarterback Tee Martin
said of Stoerner's fumble. ``Every day you're going to hear about
it. I know today that's the main question he's been asked. I admire
him for being a man about it. It says a lot to fall down and lose
what you have and then get back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner, while sticking to the time-honored tradition of one
game at a time, said he has Nov. 13 circled on his calendar. That's
when Tennessee plays at Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up to be a responsible individual. When you do
something, good or bad, you take responsibility for it,'' Stoerner
said. ``Honestly, that was my first reaction after the fumble.
There's no sense in pointing fingers.'' nn

TOTAL PACKAGE HAS LABONTE IN PURSUIT OF CUP TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett's chances of winning the Pennsylvania 500 were
hampered by a balky clutch, but even with perfect equipment the
Winston Cup points leader realized it would have been tough to
catch race-winner Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we could have caught Bobby,'' the
ever-gracious Jarrett said after finishing second. ``They have the
complete package: fuel mileage, setups.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's first comment referred to Labonte's dominant
performance Sunday at Pocono International Raceway. The 35-year-old
native of Corpus Christi won by a whopping 8.655 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second comment, though, that's important. Jarrett was
commenting on Labonte's season as a whole, not just one race.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's team has the complete package _ a talented driver,
good equipment, good personnel _ and that's why he's having the
best season of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we do have all the ingredients,'' crew chief Jimmy
Makar said. ``You can't ask for more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte used to be an ``on any given Sunday'' driver. On any
given Sunday he was a threat to win.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Joe Gibbs Racing in 1995 and won seven races in four
seasons. The team was one of the best on the Winston Cup circuit,
finishing seventh and sixth in the points the past two seasons, but
it wasn't among the handful of elite groups that are serious title
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac is a
threat to win on every given Sunday, and Labonte is in the
championship hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, the younger brother of two-time Cup champion Terry
Labonte, is third in the points, a mere 29 behind Mark Martin in
second. Jarrett is just a blip on the radar screen, 254 ahead of
Martin and 283 in front of Labonte. He'll be tough to catch,
especially if he keeps having races like the one Sunday, when he
finished second despite equipment problems.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, though, isn't ready to concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can still catch Dale Jarrett in the points race,''
he said. ``We haven't given up on the championship by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte can match Jarrett in almost every statistical category.
</P>
<P>
   The victory at Pocono was his third of the year, the same as
Jarrett; only Jeff Burton and Jeff Gordon, with four each, have
more.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has earned four poles and has 13 top-five and 14 top-10
finishes. He has led at least one lap in 16 of the 19 races.
</P>
<P>
   It's the other races that have him looking up at Jarrett. He has
five finishes of 24th or worse, including 37th in the Food City 500
at Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway and 38th in the Jiffy Lube 300 at
New Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistency kept Labonte from being among the elite last year,
when he failed to finish six races. He said that hasn't been the
case this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had some bad luck in a few races, and that's cost
us,'' he said. ``But even in the races where we finished bad, we
were running very well until our luck went bad.`
</P>
<P>
   Every successful team needs a little bit of racing luck to be
successful. Parts can't break; wrecks must be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   But fortune has little to do with Labonte's breakthrough season.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the success is that Labonte, in his seventh
season as a Cup driver and his fifth with Gibbs, is at his peak as
a driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's matured a lot as a race-car driver,'' Makar said. ``One
big thing I've seen him do is learn patience. I think early in his
career he had been trying a little too hard to impress people and
show what he could do in a race car and maybe pushed the envelope a
little bit to make that statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Another is Gibbs' decision to join the ranks of the multicar
teams and add Tony Stewart as Labonte's teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Stewart has really helped our program,'' Labonte said.
``A second team has brought more resources and more ideas to the
table. We've been able to get a lot of helpful feedback from Tony
and that team. They've already tested 10 times and we've tested
five, so they've been to five more racetracks than we have and come
back with more information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Makar was concerned that adding a team would mean a
slow start because of the adjustment period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we were going to give something up in the first
half of the season with the new car and a new team coming on board,
with the distractions and the learning curve,'' he said. ``We felt
like we'd go through some growing pains that might hinder our
performance early in the year. Quite the contrary has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened, though, is Labonte establishing himself as
one of the truly elite drivers in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great season no matter what happens from tomorrow
on,'' Labonte said. ``I won't forget that. I've definitely done
more than I've done in a whole season before. It's been a great
season no matter where we finish in points.'' nn

GOLFING MOM REACHES HALL OF FAME DOORSTEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confession being good for the soul, golf instructor Brian
Inkster offered this telltale tidbit about his favorite former
pupil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think she would ever get back to being a great
player again,'' Inkster said, reflecting on a winless stretch from
1993-96 that led his wife, Juli, to consider retiring from the LPGA
Tour to stay home with the couple's two daughters. ``I guess that
shows how much I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. By Sunday night, Inkster could be married to a Hall of
Famer. At the very least, he's married to a 39-year-old who has a
chance to become the first LPGA player since 1986 to win three
major championships in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bradley made her mark that year. Juli Inkster, with a
victory in this week's du Maurier Classic, would match that feat.
And she would do so with the pitter-patter of tiny feet belonging
to daughters Hayley, 9, and Cori, 5, tromping along in her gallery.
</P>
<P>
   At the box office, this summer may belong to Sam. But on the
LPGA Tour, June and July have belonged to Juli. With victories at
the U.S. Women's Open and the LPGA Championship, Inkster has struck
a blow for working mothers. Four years after considering
retirement, she stands one victory away from enshrinement in the
LPGA Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I wanted to prove myself after I had my family
that I could come back out here and be a top player again,'' said
Inkster, whose task has grown simpler as her children have outgrown
port-a-cribs and diapers. ``It was very frustrating for me when the
girls were little, coming out here and being a mediocre player. I'd
always been a top player and I knew I had it in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster has proved that this summer. Now, she stands in the path
of history and at the threshold of the Hall of Fame. But Inkster
declines to dwell on what might happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy with what's going on in my life and with my
golf game,'' said Inkster, who has four victories this season and
owns a slight lead over Karrie Webb in the race for player of the
year. ``I'm planning to enjoy this week because I'll probably never
have this chance again. If I don't play good in another tournament,
no one can take these past six months away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Least of all a husband who is happy to admit he underestimated
his wife's resolve in her darkest days as a professional golfer.
TOP PLAYERS TAKING DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO `SHOWDOWN'
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's time to bestow bragging rights on one of the two
players who have exchanged the title of world's top-ranked golfer
throughout the 1999 season. And the respective methods in which
Tiger Woods and David Duval are preparing for Monday's overhyped,
made-for-TV showdown in Thousand Oaks, Calif., sheds ample light on
the importance each gives to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is skipping this week's PGA Tour stop, the Canon Greater
Hartford Open, and has indicated he may squeeze in a practice round
at Sherwood Country Club before meeting Duval in Monday's 7 p.m.
match on WFAA/Channel 8. Duval is playing in Hartford, Conn.. If he
contends or wins, he may arrive in California fresh off a
cross-country flight on the morning of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he's excited to have a match with Duval because
``people have talked about us having a rivalry that could last 20
years, and we've never really gone head to head before.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval is more subdued, noting that the ``Showdown at Sherwood''
barely qualifies as a blip on the radar screen in terms of global
golfing significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to determine who the best player in the world
is,'' Duval said. ``It's not the U.S. Open or the Masters on
Sunday, with us going head to head.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's the closest thing TV executives can provide until the
world's top two players actually play their way into a meaningful
shootout at a major championship.
A SHORT(S) STORY
</P>
<P>
   This week's Canon Greater Hartford Open marks the second event
in a three-week stretch in which caddies will be allowed to wear
shorts at PGA Tour events when the heat index reaches 100 degrees.
The policy will be reviewed by tour officials after the Buick Open
(Aug. 5-8), the final event in the trial period. Shorts remain off
limits for PGA Tour players, regardless of weather conditions.
ENCOURAGING WORDS
</P>
<P>
   Lori Kane, owner of seven second-place finishes without a
victory in a three-year LPGA career, said words from Hall of Famer
Nancy Lopez helped ease her pain after a playoff loss to Sherri
Steinhauer at the Big Apple Classic (July 15-18).
</P>
<P>
   ``Lopez reminded me that, even though she's won 48 times, she's
also had 48 second places. That helped,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Lopez has 49 runner-up finishes _ one more than her
career total of victories. Lopez, 42, will compete in this week's
du Maurier Classic after missing the past month because of
arthroscopic knee surgery. SHORT PUTTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Austin, Texas, resident J.L. Lewis, champion of last week's
John Deere Classic, became the 13th first-time winner in the
event's 28-year history. A former Nike Tour participant, Lewis also
extended a streak in which at least one Nike Tour graduate has
cracked the top 10 in 164 consecutive PGA Tour events. The last
miss came in the 1996 Mercedes Championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Come-from-behind victories have been rare on the Senior Tour
this season. Final-round leaders have held on to win 17 of 23
events.
INSIDE THE NUMBERS ... PERENNIAL WINNERS

STRAIGHT TEETH BECOMING A MUST
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color cartoon of a girl with braces 
 Includes a 700-word sidebar 
 By Suzanne Boynton 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Braces have become almost a rite of passage in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The number of youngsters with braces has quadrupled since the
1960s, and it's up from 3.5 million in 1989 to more than 4.5
million now.
</P>
<P>
   Greater awareness of the benefits of orthodontia, easy-credit
financing and more dentists practicing orthodontia account for the
increase, say the experts.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 percent of the orthodontia patients are juveniles, 20
percent are 18 and older, and the majority are female.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodontics treatment averages about $4,000 per patient. It's
not covered by many dental plans, but financing plans are widely
available.
</P>
<P>
   The ''perfect smile'' is often mentioned as the goal of
orthodontia, and it usually does improve appearance. But there are
even more vital reasons to straighten teeth: crooked teeth are
harder to clean, wear unevenly, and cause stress on the jaw and gum
tissues. These can add up to more severe, more expensive problems
later. The need for treatment is increasing, say orthodontists.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 50 percent of the people could use it; 25 percent need
it,'' says Dr. Donald Guest, who has practices in Santa Rosa and
Petaluma, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil records show a steady decline in jaw size during the past
1,000 years. The number and size of teeth also has diminished, but
not as fast as jaw size. For the last 100 years or so, few people
have had room for their wisdom teeth, or 17-year molars. These
teeth are often turned sideways, so they cannot come in correctly,
a condition dentists call ''impacted.'' Impacted molars can
continue to cause trouble if they're not surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   To call themselves orthodontists, dentists must graduate from an
accredited academic program. Certification by the American Board of
Orthodontics is not required. To become board-certified,
orthodontists must pass a two-part written exam and present 10
completed patient cases before a group of peers. The process can
take as long as a decade to complete.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,895 orthodontists are board-certified in the specialty,
according to the American Board of Orthodontists _ roughly 25
percent of the number who belong to the American Association of
Orthodontists.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodontics practices gross between $227,000 and $579,000
annually, with about half going for office overhead and the rest as
profits.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about orthodontists, contact:
</P>
<P>
   The American Board of Orthodontics, 401 N. Lindbergh Blvd.,
Suite 308, St. Louis, Mo. 63141 or visit the board's Web site:
www.americanboardortho.com. The board will confirm whether an
orthodontist is certified in the specialty.

   Kitschy television shows have been broadcasting nostalgia for
the 1960s and '70s. But those were the bad old days for kids with
crooked teeth. A lot has changed since the era of metal bands,
pliers and pulled teeth. Let's review: Back Then
</P>
<P>
   Braces were installed by gluing around each tooth a metal band
with a bracket attached. A stiff, stainless-steel wire was fastened
to the brackets with short lengths of wire that the orthodontist
bent and twisted into the desired shape with needle-nose pliers.
</P>
<P>
   This painful process was repeated every few weeks or so, causing
predictably sore gums and, not uncommonly, headaches. Every few
visits, a stiffer wire was applied, adding to the discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   The total thickness of all the bands in the mouth was about
equal to that of a tooth, said orthodontist Dr. Thomas Bales of
Santa Rosa, Calif. To make room for the bands in an already crowded
mouth, a tooth often had to be pulled.
</P>
<P>
   But they couldn't remove just one.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mouth is symmetrical, so if you remove one on one side,
you have to remove one on the other side,'' Bales says. ''Remove
two on top, and you have to remove two on the bottom, or you create
an overbite.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a set of braces almost always meant pulling at least four
teeth.
 &UR; Today's Braces &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are no bands around the teeth. The brackets are
glued to the outside of the teeth and are fitted to the shape of
each tooth, so the wire doesn't have to be twisted to get the
desired shape.
</P>
<P>
   Stainless steel has been retired. The wire band is now a
''memory'' metal alloy of nickel and titanium developed by NASA for
use on satellites. The memory wire is bent into the shape of the
ideal dental arch. Under refrigeration, it slumps like spaghetti,
and is easy for the orthodontist to work with. Once it's installed
and reaches mouth temperature, it ''remembers'' its original shape
and begins gently urging the teeth into that perfect-smile shape.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is much lower than that exerted by the old wires,
yet it works just as quickly, with longer periods between
adjustments, said Dr. Donald Guest, an orthodontist in Santa Rosa
and Petaluma, Calif. ''The discomfort is a lot less _ some adults
have none.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else has changed, too. Kids want today's high-tech
braces.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 7- to 9-year-olds seem to enjoy the process,'' Guest says.
''It's cool for them to have braces.''
</P>
<P>
   Today many orthodontists favor a two-stage treatment for most
patients. It usually starts at age 7 to 9, goes for 12 to 15
months, takes a break until adolescence, then goes another 12 to 15
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to do it only when all the teeth were through, age 13
to 15,'' Bales says. ''Most of the growth had taken place, so
severe overbites would become even more severe, and you'd ask a
15-year-old to wear headgear 20 hours a day. That was not very
realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The more serious the malocclusion (bad bite), the worse you
need two-phase treatment,'' says Guest, because orthodontics can't
deal with both the major crowding problems and the more detailed
work of perfecting the bite at the same time.
 &UR; Pick Your Colors &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Today's braces have accessories that also make the wearing easy.
</P>
<P>
   There's a special wax to press onto the parts of the braces that
rub the inside of a tender lip at night or while eating.
</P>
<P>
   There's the floss threader, which enables those with braces to
floss between her teeth above the braces.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rainbow of rubber band colors.
</P>
<P>
   The rubber bands that hold the wire to the brackets are changed
at each visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could have red for Valentine's Day, red and blue for the
Fourth of July, orange and black for Halloween, favorite team
colors,'' Bales says. ''Our visits used to run 12 minutes each. Now
it's 15 _ it takes three extra minutes for the kids to pick their
colors.''

EASY-TO-GR0W GOURDS MAKE NIFTY CRAFT PROJECTS
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of colorful large and small gourds 
 By SUSAN McCLURE 
 c.1999 Susan McClure 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before copper and ceramics, people relied on natural containers
_ such as gourds _ to carry water and food.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest preserved examples of gourds come from Mexico and
Peru. Choctow and Chickasaw Native Americans made gourd birdhouses
to attract colonies of purple martins and clear the air of insects.
Gourds have been, and still are, made into instruments _ drums,
harps, lyres, and primitive guitars and banjos.
</P>
<P>
   More than mere ordinary household objects, gourds also have
generated their own superstitions, writes Ginger Summit in ''Gourds
in Your Garden.'' In Hawaii, pot-bellied men planted gourd seeds
with the hope that the gourd would grow to mimic the planter's
round physique. In 16th century England, women were not allowed to
handle gourds for fear they would ''feeble and wither.''
</P>
<P>
   Today gourds are avidly grown by gardeners and crafters.
</P>
<P>
   Bottle gourds, most of which originate in Africa, include a
variety of rounded, hard-shelled gourds named by their shape _
cannon ball, basket ball, canteen, sugar bowl, bushel basket, and
kettle. There are pear-shaped bottle gourds and long-necked penguin
gourds used for bird houses, vases, and, of course, bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Dipper gourds have a bottom bulb with a long, thin, handle-like
neck. Banana and snake gourds are long and slim _ some growing into
oddities 5 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these classic gourds are the ornamental gourds you use to
stuff a cornucopia at Thanksgiving time. True kid-pleasers, these
gourds come in bright green, gold and orange and are shaped like
oranges, pears, spoons, crown of thorns, apples, and bells with
smooth or warty textures.
</P>
<P>
   Loofa gourds, available in elongated oval or small ball shapes,
are commonly harvested when very young for Oriental cuisine and
served marinated, pickled, or stuffed. Let the gourd reach full
maturity and the fibrous interior becomes an organic scrubber for
kitchen or bath.
 &UR; Growing Gourds &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Plant seedlings outdoors in a garden with full sun and plenty of
space or a trellis to ramble up.
</P>
<P>
   To eliminate weeds, you can cover the gourd bed with black
plastic mulch. Summit suggests cutting planting holes in the
plastic every 4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Fast and feisty growers, gourd vines need rich soil, best
provided by adding extra compost or rotted livestock manure to the
planting area or even the entire gourd bed.
</P>
<P>
   If seedlings start slowly, they may need an extra fertility
boost. Water with fish emulsion now and again as the plants begin
to vine. But once the flowers appear, stop applying nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Such lavish, tropical vines use an abundance of water so run a
soaker hose beside the vines. Be sure not to let the soil dry out
for the first 4 to 6 weeks after planting. After that you may need
to water only once or twice as week. It's natural for the large
leaves to wilt during hot summer days _ even if the soil is moist _
so don't worry. But if the leaves don't perk up by evening, that's
a sign the plants need more water.
</P>
<P>
   Stop watering in fall as the gourds grow mature and hard.
</P>
<P>
   To get more gourds and less rambling growth, Summit suggests
cutting off the growing tip of 10-foot long vines to encourage side
branches to sprout. Side branches produce more female blossoms and
thus more fruit.
</P>
<P>
   If you get a kick out of growing big pumpkins and zucchini,
you'll probably want to try some of the monstrous snake gourds and
other big gourds. They may be best allowed to ramble along the
ground where weight will not be an issue. If growing gourds on a
trellis, provide extra support with a pantyhose sling to keep a
hefty gourd from tearing the vines down.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've conquered gourd growing, you can explore the fine
art of gourd shaping. While young and pliable, gourds are
especially malleable. You can etch patterns in the surface of a
gourd, using care not to push through the skin. You can surround
the gourd with a firm mold, such as a wooden box to make the gourd
assume a square shape. You also can twist a long-necked gourd
around a post to make it into a spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Let gourds mature completely before harvesting them. For long
lasting hard-shelled types, this means waiting until the vine dies
to cut them free. Expect to give them another couple months to dry
indoors too, until the gourd is light and the seeds rattle inside.
Although it might appear something is going wrong, these gourds
reach their prime when the outer skin discolors and appears to
decay.
</P>
<P>
   To reveal the beautiful woody gourd beneath, soak the gourd in
warm water for an hour, holding it down beneath a weighted pan lid,
then use a copper kitchen scrubber to remove the skin.
</P>
<P>
   You can polish gourds with liquid floor wax or vegetable oil to
show off their natural luster and also carve them and decorate as
desired.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ It was the week before our 25th
high school reunion, and the e-mails poured in like distress
signals from a sinking ship. ``It's the last week before this
reunion thing and panic is setting in,'' wrote my friend Janet.
``The letter said the Saturday night thing would include `games'?
What do they mean by this? Trivial Pursuit? The kinds of idiotic
games one plays at Tupperware parties? Who can name the high school
football team members? Also, what does one wear? Helphelphelphelp

the White House and hearing Jack and Bobby talk about him.'' (Bass,

   Cherry tomatoes: Roundly applauded
</P>
<P>
   By Ann Heller
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Some backyard gardeners worry about rampant
zucchini. They probably haven't confronted a cherry tomato plant on
a roll.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the summer, the cherry tomatoes ripen in waves.
Vines are weighted down with fat clusters, begging to be pulled off
by the handful.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly they end up being eaten like a snack. But there are other
ways to put this abundance to good _ and very easy _ use. Unlike
big tomatoes, these sweet little morsels don't have to be peeled,
seeded or cored. They're ready to use after a brief rinse.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a one-size-fits-all crop. Cherry tomatoes come in a
variety of sizes, colors and sweetness, from the so-called yellow
pear to red grape tomatoes, so it's worth sampling the offerings of
various farmers to find what you like.
</P>
<P>
   One variety fancied in this area is the low-acid, super-sweet
Sweet One Million cherry tomato, an offspring of the better known
Sweet One Hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a handful of ways to let cherry tomatoes star in your
meals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make grown-up snacks called Tomatoes Margarita: This easy
recipe is so good it should become the hit of the summer party and
picnic season. First, pull the stems from two pints of cherry
tomatoes. Mince 1/4 cup cilantro very fine and combine with 1/2 cup
coarse sea salt in a small bowl. Combine
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup tequila and the juice of a lime in another bowl. Tell
guests to dip the tomatoes in the tequila, then into the seasoned
salt. Addictive!
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The recipe is from the new book ``Tomatoes'' by Patricia Mack
(Record, $16.75).
</P>
<P>
   _ Saute cherry tomatoes as an easy side dish. Rinse the tomatoes
and remove the stems. Place on paper towels to dry. Heat a little
oil or butter in a large skillet and add some minced onion or
slivered garlic. Cook a minute or two. Add cherry tomatoes, no
deeper than a single layer. Cook over medium heat just until the
tomato skins start to blister, about four or five minutes. Sprinkle
with salt, pepper and snippets of fresh herbs such as basil or
mint. The tomatoes should remain whole; if they collapse they
become mushy. Serve warm.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a quick pasta sauce. While pasta is cooking, heat equal
parts of olive oil and butter in a large skillet. Saute the chopped
white and green parts of a bunch of green onions and when they are
soft, add about a teaspoon minced garlic. Stir for a minute and add
a heaping pint of stemmed cherry tomatoes and cook, shaking the
pan, three or four minutes. Season with salt and pepper and a
generous handful of chopped herbs. Add a half cup or so of the
pasta cooking water to the sauce and continue cooking. As the
tomato skins begin to burst remove from heat. Drain the pasta and
toss with the sauce. Top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make German tomatoes using cherry tomatoes in this family
recipe that can last for days in the refrigerator. Rinse and stem a
pint of cherry tomatoes. Wash and cut an equal amount of small
pickling cucumbers into slices. Cut a medium onion into rings.
Combine vegetables in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper and
2 or 3 tablespoons sugar. Combine 5 tablespoons cider vinegar and 3
tablespoons water and mix with the vegetables. Stir until sugar is
dissolved and taste for balance, adding more sugar or vinegar if
needed. Refrigerate for at least an hour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a balsamic cherry tomato salad: Cut the cherry tomatoes
in half and sprinkle with coarse salt to draw out juices to flavor
the dressing. After a half hour, sprinkle with snipped chives and
parsley. Make a balsamic vinegar dressing (two parts olive oil to
one part vinegar) and pour over tomatoes. Arrange a mound of
arugula (now available at some supermarkets by the bag instead of
the ounce) on a plate and pile the tomatoes on top. Because both
the tomatoes and vinegar are sweet, taste and add salt to balance
the flavor.

 &HT;    Tomatoes add zest to dishes
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Cherry tomatoes are showcased in this
French-style gratin that's a wonderful summer side dish. The
tomatoes are covered with a ricotta-and-basil mixture and baked
just 15 minutes, so they remain whole. Take a bite and each warm
tomato explodes with flavor.
</P>
<P>
   CHERRY TOMATO GRATIN
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds cherry tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dried bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup snipped fresh basil, divided
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup ricotta
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cream
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a shallow baking dish large enough to hold the tomatoes
snugly packed in a single layer. Using 2 tablespoons of the olive
oil, grease the bottom and sides of the dish. Add the tomatoes,
rolling them around to coat with the oil.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the bread crumbs, garlic, 5 tablespoons of the basil,
1/4 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper. Sprinkle half of the
mixture over the tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the ricotta, the remaining 3 tablespoons basil and 1/2
teaspoon salt, the eggs and cream. Stir until well blended and
creamy. Pour over the crumb-topped tomatoes. Sprinkle with the
remaining bread-crumb mixture and drizzle with the remaining 1
tablespoon oil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake about 15 minutes until bubbling. The tomatoes should not
have burst. Let cool slightly before serving. Offer crusty bread to
mop up the juices.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 164 calories, 11 g
fat, 69 cholesterol, 158 sodium.
</P>
<P>
   _ The recipe is from ``The Vegetarian Table'' (France) by
Georgeanne Brennan (Chronicle, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Cherry tomatoes also do well in a supporting performance in this
pasta salad that a friend adapted from ``Food and Wine'' magazine.
For more cherry tomato inspiration, check out the July issue of
``Gourmet'' magazine, which has Sicilian cherry tomato pasta sauce
on the cover, Greek cherry tomato and tuna salad as ``The Last
Touch'' and a BLT salad made with cherry tomatoes in between.

   If you must tinker with a good thing. . .
</P>
<P>
   While cherry tomatoes beg to be used as is, there are recipes
that call for hollowing them, stuffing them and serving them as
appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   It's time-consuming and fiddling work, but if you feel inclined,
here's a tip to make it easier:
</P>
<P>
   Many recipes suggest hollowing out the stem end and trimming a
smidgen off the bottom so the tomato will sit flat. But if you do
that it quickly begins to seep juices.
</P>
<P>
   A much better technique is to set the tomato stem side down
without cutting it. Hollow out only the other side, which is the
blossom end. Positioned stem-side down, the tomatoes are less
likely to roll. If the possibility still worries you, serve
tomatoes on a stabilizing bed of rock salt.
</P>
<P>
   Also make sure you select large cherry tomatoes. It's difficult
to hollow out small ones (the melon baller is the usual tool
suggested).
</P>
<P>
   Fillings are myriad. Think of seasoned cream cheese, hummus,
olive tapanade and bean purees.

 &HT;    Vols, 'Noles on collision course
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida State and Tennessee, opponents for the national
championship last January, are on a collision course for a rematch
in the 2000 Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Six of seven preseason magazines on college football ranked
Florida State No. 1, and a seventh, The Sporting News, put Penn
State on top. Tennessee, which won the national championship by
beating Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl, edged Penn State for the
second spot because it was ranked No. 2 four times and No. 3 three
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the talent everybody has coming back, a
Florida State-Tennessee rematch seems like a real possibility,''
said Charlie Miller of Athlon magazine. ``There are very few teams
around that can put as much talent on the field as those two.'' One
of them could be Penn State, which would have been No. 2 if not for
a No. 7 ranking from Street &AMP; Smith's. Coach Joe Paterno returns 41
of his top 48 players and has a favorable schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, it just looks like all the stars are lined up for Penn
State,'' said Tom Dienhart of The Sporting News, which ranked the
Nittany Lions No. 1. ``This is Paterno's 50th year at Penn State.
Jerry Sandusky, his longtime defensive coordinator, is retiring
after this year. They don't play Wisconsin, and they have Michigan
and Ohio State at home. It seems set up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State does, however, have a potentially dangerous season
opener against No. 4 Arizona, which travels to State College on
Aug. 28 for the Pigskin Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State is a strong No. 1 based on the return of wide
receiver Peter Warrick and running back Travis Minor on offense and
a defense expected to be even faster and more talented than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team can be as good as it wants to be,'' Warrick said at
last week's ACC Football Meetings. ``And we want to be very, very
good. Losing to Tennessee hurt this team. We want another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of the magazines picked Michigan No. 5, followed
by Texas A&AMP;M and Nebraska. Wisconsin and Florida tied for eighth,
and Ohio State was 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech was ranked No. 11 with a high ranking of No. 8 and
low of 14. Georgia was tied with the University of Miami for No. 13
with a high ranking of No. 8 and a low of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Picking the Top 25 is no exact science, but it can be a
painstaking effort for the magazines.
</P>
<P>
   At Athlon, for example, Miller gets input from the five members
of his editorial staff and from the various freelance writers who
contribute to the magazine. He also has a fact sheet on each of the
114 Division I teams with information about the key returning
players and how recruiting could affect the quality of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I lock us all up in a big room, and we fight it out until
we have 25,'' Miller said. ``Some picks are very easy. Others we
have real battles over.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Sporting News, Dienhart makes the final selections after
consulting with his writers and reading fact sheets on each
Division I school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, we'll go a little out on a limb with a pick,''
Deinhart said. ``But that's what makes this business fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ACC, Florida State was the unanimous pick to win a least
a share of the title for the eighth year in a row. Georgia Tech got
all of the No. 2 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the SEC, all seven of the magazines picked Tennessee to win
the Eastern Division, with Florida and Georgia following. Two
magazines, Athlon and Jeff Whittaker, picked the Bulldogs to finish
ahead of Florida. In the Western Division, Arkansas got four
first-place votes to edge out Alabama. LSU was a distant third.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: News reports say that if the space shuttle Columbia had to
make an emergency landing, it would be either in Florida or West
Africa. I've never heard that NASA had any landing strip in Africa.
Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: NASA says there are four contingency Transoceanic Abort
Landing (TAL) sites: Yundum International Airport, Banjul, Gambia;
Ben Guerir Air Base, Morocco; and Moron Air Base and Zaragoza Air
Base, both in Spain. The TAL sites for STS-93 are Yundum (primary)
and Ben Guerir (alternate), according to NASA spokeswoman Kirsten
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on mission requirements, an orbiter follows an orbital
insertion inclination between 28.5 and 57 degrees, with the lower
inclination preferred because it allows for a higher maximum
payload weight.
</P>
<P>
   Yundum is on a flat plain 7 miles inland from the Atlantic and 6
miles south of the Gambia River. It lies almost directly below the
28.5-degree flight path. The runway is 11,810 feet long and 150
feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco is between 27 degrees and 37 degrees north. Ben Guerir,
a former Strategic Air Command base abandoned in 1963, is on a
flat, rocky plain about 36 miles north of Marrakech. Its runway is
14,000 feet long and 200 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several articles have referred to the penthouse residence of
John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy in TriBeCa. What
does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: Spelled both TriBeCa and Tribeca, it's an area of Manhattan
whose name stands for Triangle Below Canal (Street).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the story concerning the father of Lauren Bessette and
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy? He hasn't been mentioned in all the
coverage about the sisters' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   A: The sisters' father, William Bessette, and their mother, Anne
Freeman, divorced when Lauren Bessette and her twin, Lisa Ann, were
8 (Carolyn was 18 months younger). The children were raised by
their mother and her second husband, Dr. Richard Freeman, chief of
orthopedic surgery at White Plains Hospital in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Bessette has remained conspicuously out of the public eye and
apparently didn't attend public services for his daughters. Or if
he did, it escaped notice. Very little is known about him. One
report published last week described him as a cabinet salesman from
White Plains; another said he was an architectural engineer in
White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani visiting
Arkansas mentioned the state's lieutenant governor, Winthrop
Rockefeller. Is he part of the northeast Rockefeller clan? Do you
have any other information about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, he's part of the clan. Winthrop P., the Republican
lieutenant governor of Arkansas, is the only son of Winthrop
Rockefeller, who served as the Republican governor of Arkansas from
Jan. 10, 1967, to Jan. 12, 1971. John Davison Rockefeller of
Standard Oil fame had one son, John D. Jr.; John D. Jr. had five
sons (John D. III, Nelson, Laurance, Winthrop and David).
</P>
<P>
   Winthrop P. (or ``Win'') has been involved in public service in
Arkansas for more than 25 years, working with the Boy Scouts of
America, the Nature Conservancy, the Winthrop Rockefeller
Foundation, the Arkansas Cancer Research Center, the Arkansas Arts
Center Foundation, the Arkansas Crime Commission and the Arkansas
State Police Commission. He also was chairman of the President's
Council on Rural America, appointed by President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller attended Oxford University and is a graduate of
Texas Christian University. He has seven children and with his
wife, Lisenne, maintains homes in Little Rock and at Winrock Farms,
Petit St. Jean Mountain, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about ``Unto These Hills,'' the
outdoor drama? What is the subject, and how can we get tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A: The play, in its 50th anniversary season, covers nearly 300
years of Cherokee history, from 1540 (the encounter between the
Cherokees and Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto) until the late
1830s (the ``Trail of Tears,'' the forced removal of the people to
Oklahoma). It's presented nightly (except Sundays) in the outdoor
Mountainside Theatre, a 2,800-seat facility in Cherokee, N.C. The
current season opened June 11; it ends Aug. 21. Tickets are $11-$14
for adults, $5 for children 6-12. Information: online at
www.dnet.net/(tilde)cheratt or 828-497-2111.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did John F. Kennedy Jr. ever serve in the Navy? If not, how
was he eligible for burial ceremonies at sea involving a Navy ship?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kennedy never served in the military. Under Navy regulations,
U.S. citizens without military connections can be buried from a
naval vessel only if the chief of naval operations makes an
exception in recognition of their ``notable service or outstanding
contributions to the United States.'' Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief
of naval operations, ordered the USS Briscoe to participate after
being Defense Secretary William Cohen asked him to support a
request by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon statement said Kennedy qualified for burial at sea
not only because his father was president and a World War II Navy
hero, but also because the 38-year-old Kennedy's contributions to
his country ``are both notable and outstanding.'' The statement
cited his role as head of Reaching Up, a nonprofit group that
assists people who work with the disabled, and his service on the
President's Commission on Mental Retardation.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 members of the military and their children are buried
at sea each year, according to the Navy, but they are buried en
masse, their ashes scattered during normal naval exercises. By
contrast, the destroyer Briscoe was diverted from routine training
exercises offshore of Norfolk, Va., to the site off Martha's
Vineyard, Mass., where the ashes of Kennedy, his wife and
sister-in-law were committed to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With flags being lowered for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death,
everyone seems to say ``half-staff.'' But when I was growing up,
the term I always heard for displaying flags during periods of
mourning was ``half-mast.'' Which is correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: It should be half-staff on land, half-mast at sea. The terms
are used interchangably in a civilian context, but in military
useage, it depends on the branch of service involved. It's
half-mast in the Navy and Coast Guard, half-staff for all other
branches.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm fascinated by the name Martha's Vineyard. Was there a
Martha, and was there a vineyard?
</P>
<P>
   A: The island first was called Louisa, according to the Martha's
Vineyard Chamber of Commerce. It got that name in 1542 by Italian
navigator and pirate Giovanni da Verrazano, who sailed past it. The
Indians called it Noepe, and other explorers gave it different
names. But the one that stuck was given in 1602 by Bartholomew
Gosnold, who named it for one of his daughters, Martha, and for the
wild grapes that grew on it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the interest in Kathleen Ann Soliah and the
Symbionese Liberation Army, I'm wondering: What has become of the
boyfriend who was living with Patty Hearst when she was kidnapped?
And what has happened to Patty herself?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hearst was engaged to Steven Weed when the kidnapping
occurred at their apartment in Berkeley, Calif., on Feb. 5, 1974.
He now is married, the father of two sons, and works for a property
management and real estate investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif. He
seems to prefer not dwelling on the past, and isn't much interested
in discussing the present, either. ``That's the beginning and the
end,'' he once told Time magazine. Weed did, however, write a book
in 1976 titled ``My Search for Patty Hearst.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, meanwhile, is married, has two teenage daughters, and is
a resident of New York and Westport, Conn. She has written two
books and has appeared in several films by offbeat director John
Waters. She shows up often at celebrity and charity events in New
York, where her husband, Bernard Shaw, a former San Francisco
police officer and her onetime bodyguard, is an executive with the
Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm 76 and have been following the space program ever since
the early '50s. What was the temperature encountered by the
American astronauts when they landed on the moon? I've never seen
it reported.
</P>
<P>
   A: The surface temperature of the moon at the time and in the
place of the lunar landing site was estimated at 40-90 degrees F in
the sun and 150 degrees below zero F in the shade. Neil Armstrong
and Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin Jr. were encased in spacesuits providing
a temperature-controlled atmosphere that was kept at about 68
degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the JFK Jr. accident, did all of the government agencies
respond on a normal basis, or was it at the behest of the president
or family members in Massachusetts with clout?
</P>
<P>
   A: Federal officials said that in the early days, when the focus
was on finding survivors, the mission essentially was like
thousands of others. But it's obvious that the search became much
more aggressive and sophisticated than efforts usually launched for
average citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about it at a news conference, President Clinton said:
``Because the Coast Guard felt they had the capacity to succeed and
because of the role of the Kennedy family in our national lives, I
thought it was appropriate to give them a few more days. And if
anybody believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at fault, I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that the federal government spends at least
$370 million a year on small plane and boat search and rescue
operations. The Coast Guard alone says it handles more than 40,000
rescue cases a year, including 400-500 plane crashes. The National
Transportation Safety Board, the other lead agency in the Kennedy
case, says it investigates every plane crash, including some 1,900
accidents involving private planes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, meanwhile, say public interest and the media
contributed to the decision to add resources to the Kennedy search.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was no media interest, we wouldn't need to have as
many people there,'' said Phil Frame of the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any directory of fax, cell phone and pager numbers?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, but you can find some of those numbers in some
advertisements in the Yellow Pages. BellSouth spokesman Jeff
Batcher said it's up to consumers whether their cell, fax or pager
numbers will be made public. Those are considered private numbers
of the individuals, so they're listed only at the customer's
request.
</P>
<P>
   Q: California State Sen. Tom Hayden has proposed a new law to
force the elderly to take annual driving tests. Is he the anti-war
activist once married to Jane Fonda?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Hayden, a Democrat, is Fonda's ex. His measure, which
would apply to drivers in California, narrowly cleared the state
Senate last month and faces stiff opposition in the state Assembly
from the senior citizen lobby. Hayden's bill, SB 335, is also
called the Brandi Mitlock Safe Drivers Act, after a 15-year-old
killed by a 96-year-old hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Santa
Monica street. The driver reportedly had rebuffed repeated attempts
by family members to surrender his car keys.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require California drivers 75 and older to take
written, vision and road tests for regular license renewals. After
age 80, they would be required to take those tests every three
years; after 86, every two years; and after 90, every year.

<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A said the Atlanta Hawks basketball team once played as the
Tri-City Blackhawks. Where was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tri-City refers to the sister cities of Davenport, Iowa, and
Moline and Rock Island, Ill. The term Blackhawks probably came from
the famous Native American chief, Black Hawk, who once lived in the
region. The Blackhawks, of the old National Basketball League,
started there in 1946. When the team moved to Milwaukee in 1951,
owners shortened the name to Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we obtain tickets to next year's baseball All-Star
game in Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: Information is not yet available. Look for an announcement
about tickets sometime between the first of next year and the start
of spring training, said Braves publicist Glen Serra.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is Caesar Rodney and why is he depicted on the 1999
Delaware quarter?
</P>
<P>
   A: The coin honors Rodney for a historic horseback ride July
1-2, 1776, that made him the hero of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The Continental Congress was meeting that spring and summer to
contemplate declaring independence from the British Crown. The
Delaware delegates included Thomas McKean and George Read, both of
New Castle, and Rodney, of Kent. McKean and Rodney were in favor of
independence, but Read felt that it was too drastic a move.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney received a message from McKean saying that on July 2, the
Continental Congress would vote on the issue. Knowing that Read was
opposed, McKean asked Rodney to rush to Philadelphia. Despite
hardships _ historical accounts say he was suffering from a serious
facial cancer and asthma, and he endured summer heat and
thunderstorms _ Rodney made the 80-mile ride and arrived at the
Pennsylvania State House during the last minutes of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   He made it just in time to cast his vote, breaking the tie among
Delaware's delegates in favor of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you quote the passages of Scripture that John F. Kennedy
Jr. read at the services after his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, died?
</P>
<P>
   A: At the funeral mass May 23, 1994, at Manhattan's St. Ignatius
Loyola Roman Catholic Church, Kennedy prefaced his Scripture
reading and those of others by saying they ``captured the essence
of my mother . . . her love of words, the bonds of home and family
and her spirit of adventure.'' His reading, from Isaiah 25:8: ``The
Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces.''
</P>
<P>
   At the graveside service at Arlington National Cemetery, he read
from 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18: ``But I would not have you to be
ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that you
sorrow not, even as others which have no hope, for if we believe
that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in
Jesus will God bring with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not
prevent them which are asleep, for the Lord Himself shall descend
from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with
the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, we which are alive and remain shall be called up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and
so shall we ever be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another
with these words.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of former Milwaukee/Atlanta Brave Eddie
Mathews? During the great pregame show at the All-Star Game, it
seemed like every living old-timer was there except him.
</P>
<P>
   A: Mathews, who lives in Del Mar, Calif., was injured in a fall
a few years ago, requiring a lengthy convalescence. But he has made
a ``fine recovery,'' said Braves spokesman Glen Serra. Mathews is
doing so well, in fact, that he's scheduled to be in Atlanta for
induction into the inaugural Braves Hall of Fame ceremony Aug. 20,
along with Henry Aaron, Phil Niekro and Warren Spahn.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did former House Speaker Newt Gingrich ever fully repay the
$300,000 he borrowed to pay his ethics fine?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. But he didn't borrow the money after all, even though it
was widely reported that Bob Dole had offered to make such a loan.
Gingrich paid the penalty out of his own personal funds. The
payment was structured so that Gingrich would close the books on
his punishment by the end of the 105th Congress, which, as it
turned out, also was the end of Gingrich's congressional career
because of his unexpected retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where I can file a complaint against an airline? I don't want
to write to the airline itself.
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Department of Transportation's Aviation Consumer
Protection Division is the place. It operates a complaint handling
system for consumers who experience air travel service problems
(not to be confused with concerns about airline safety or
security).
</P>
<P>
   Call, write or e-mail the ACPD to register your concerns. The
24-hour phone line: 202-366-2220. Regular mail address: Aviation
Consumer Protection Division, U.S. Department of Transportation,
Room 4107, C-75, Washington, DC 20590. E-mail address:
airconsumer(AT)ost.dot.gov
</P>
<P>
   The division requests that you be brief and concise in
describing your problem, and that you include your name, address
and daytime phone number; the name of the airline or company about
which you're complaining; and the flight date, flight number and
origin and destination cities of your trip. If you write, you also
should include a copy of your airline ticket (not the original) and
any correspondence you already may have exchanged with the company.
</P>
<P>
   While the division doesn't mediate individual consumer
complaints, all complaints are entered into the DOT's computerized
aviation industry monitoring system and are charged to the company
in question in the monthly Air Travel Consumer Report.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you provide some background information on Eileen
Collins, commander of the latest space shuttle mission? Also, is
she by any chance the daughter of Michael Collins, one of the
Apollo 11 astronauts?
</P>
<P>
   A: Air Force Col. Eileen Marie Collins, the first woman assigned
by NASA as a space shuttle commander, is not related to Michael
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   She was born Nov. 19, 1956, in Elmira, N.Y., to Jim and Rose
Collins. She graduated from Elmira Free Academy in 1974; received
an associate in science degree in math/science from Corning (N.Y.)
Community College in 1976; a bachelor of arts degree in math and
economics from Syracuse University in 1978; a master of science
degree in operations research from Stanford University in 1986; and
a master of arts degree in space systems management from Webster
University (St. Louis) in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Selected by NASA in January 1990, Collins became an astronaut in
July 1991. Initially assigned to Orbiter engineering support, she
also has served on the astronaut support team, worked in Mission
Control as a spacecraft communicator, and served as the astronaut
office space systems branch chief. A veteran of two space flights,
Collins logged more than 419 hours in space before the recent
Columbia flight. She piloted STS-63 (Feb. 2-11, 1995) and STS-84
(May 15-24, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   She is married to Pat Youngs; they have one child.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the Federal Aviation Administration require operators of
hot air balloons to be licensed?
</P>
<P>
   A: An individual operating a hot air balloon is required to have
a private pilot certificate with a balloon rating. That rating is
an addendum to a private pilot certificate allowing the person to
operate a balloon, said agency spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do porter and stout beers compare in calories and alcohol
content to regular beer and lite beer?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's ``quite a bit of variability'' in the percentages of
alcohol content and calories in beer, said Chris Rosenbloom,
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association and a professor
at Georgia State University. A number of factors are involved,
including the country where the beer is produced.
</P>
<P>
   But she cited these as average, approximate comparative
statistics, based on a serving of 12 ounces (a normal-size bottle):
regular beer, 5 percent alcohol, 155-170 calories; lite beer, 4.1
percent alcohol, 100-120 calories; stout, 4 1/2 to more than 7
percent alcohol, 170-220 calories; and porter, 5 1/2-6 1/2 percent
alcohol, 212-240 calories.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Articles about the Kennedy family tragedies listed the death
of Patrick Bouvier Kennedy shortly after birth. But didn't John F.
Kennedy and Jackie have a fourth child, who was stillborn some
seven months before John F. Kennedy Jr. was born? That child never
seems to be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   A: A daughter was stillborn, but not in the time frame you
mention. That daughter, who was unnamed, was stillborn on Aug. 23,
1956. Caroline Kennedy was born on Nov. 27, 1957. John Jr. was born
on Nov. 25, 1960. Another son, Patrick Bouvier, was born
prematurely on Aug. 7, 1963; he died two days later. Both the
stillborn child and Patrick are buried at Arlington National
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Two of John and Jacqueline Kennedy's children were buried at
Arlington National Cemetery. I thought Arlington was restricted to
those with a military background. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because of limited space, burial at Arlington is reserved for
specific categories of honorably discharged U.S. service members,
such as those who died while on active duty; those who have had at
least 20 years of active duty or active reserve service; and
several other categories, including the spouse of an eligible
service member and any unmarried minor children (under 21 years).
Exceptions have been granted by the secretary of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy was eligible for burial in Arlington by his
military service in World War II and by his position as the
nation's commander-in-chief, explained Sgt. 1st Class Lewis Matson
of the U.S. Military District of Washington. As such, his
under-21children were eligible for burial with him. In December
1963, his two deceased children were reburied in Arlington: Patrick
Bouvier Kennedy, who died two days after he was born prematurely on
Aug. 7, 1963; and an unnamed daughter who was stillborn on Aug. 23,
1956.
</P>
<P>
   Complete information on Arlington, including burial policies,
can be found online at the Military DIstrict's Web site:
www.mdw.army.mil
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the Red Cross is experiencing a shortage of blood, and
I want to help. How can I find out where to donate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call 1-800-GIVE-LIFE (1-800-448-3543), which is set up
through the Red Cross national offices in Washington. It will route
calls to your local blood services region and will provide blood
drive information for your area up to four weeks in advance. This
information changes routinely as blood drives are added or removed
from the schedule.

   The town that loves horseshoe competition
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, Ohio _ Tori Eaton raised her right arm until the
horseshoe in her gloved hand leveled with her forehead.
</P>
<P>
   She paused, her eyes focused 30 feet away on a steel stake
driven into a bed of clay. Riveted onlookers tuned out clanks from
other pitching courts at Greenville's city park.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, with a windup less pronounced but just as deliberate
as that of an underhand softball pitch, Eaton lobbed the horseshoe.
One of its heels caught the stake and the shoe spiraled down. A
ringer.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, another metallic clink boosted Eaton's standing
in the World Horseshoe Tournament's 17-and-under girls division.
She and her opponent walked up to the pitching box to inspect their
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two ringers _ six,'' Eaton called to the scorekeeper, who
marked the scorecard with two O's, each denoting three points.
</P>
<P>
   Before the World Horseshoe Tournament ends Saturday, some 1,500
competitors hailing from 47 states, Canada and Norway will pepper
scoresheets with thousands of X's and O's _ a tangible tribute to
Greenville's love affair with horseshoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here pitches, versus at home, where everyone's like,
'What's horseshoes?''' said Eaton, 17, of Andover, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a fling, any longtime Greenville resident will
tell you. Although home to only 14,000 residents, the Treaty City
is holding its fifth world tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our best horseshoe tournaments have been pitched here
in Greenville,'' noted Paul Stewart, field vice president of the
National Horseshoe Pitchers Association, which oversees the
tournament. ``This was a hotbed for horseshoes for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Darke County's horseshoe tradition had humble beginnings, with
many learning the game by tossing shoes once trodden by draft
horses at stakes driven into dirt barn floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the late 1940s or early 1950s, a group of Greenville
residents began pitching from one guy's backyard across an alley
into another guy's backyard,'' recalled Jerry Williams, a member of
the Darke County Horseshoe Club, which boasts more than 80 members.
</P>
<P>
   Four pitching courts opened in the city's park not long after
that, Williams said, and the Annual Ringer Classic, held over the
Fourth of July weekend, soon became a staple of summer life in
Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's horseshoe pitching championships were first held here in
1957; since then, Greenville has held all but one state
competition. The park had 18 pitching courts by 1962, when the city
welcomed its first world tournament.
</P>
<P>
   While the park still holds several world tournament games,
including the championships, which begin Thursday, most of the
competition is at the Darke County Fairgrounds. The two-week event
is expected to draw 7,000 people. Adding to crowds last weekend at
the fairgrounds were festivities celebrating the life of Annie
Oakley, another dead ringer with Darke County roots.
</P>
<P>
   In the power-washed, freshly painted swine barn, four huge fans
stirred sultry air as competitors pitched on 16 courts surrounded
by chain link fence. Though accustomed to pitching in
air-conditioned comfort at the world tournament, many veteran
competitors made light of temperatures in the mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that handkerchief?'' grinned Lee Wallace, 74, of Dallas,
Ore., holding out a sweat-soaked red cloth as he exited the swine
barn. ``Oregon doesn't have this kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, whose 43.0 ringer percentage at the 1994 world
tournament in Syracuse, N.Y., earned him the senior Class C
championship, can appreciate Darke County's legacy of horseshoe
pitching. A World War II veteran, he described a photograph of
himself as a young serviceman, holding a horseshoe while standing
in front of a pitching court in Guam.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace still harbors hopes of finding a horseshoe with a
``U.S.'' marking someday, though he suspects the military
deep-sixed many of its horseshoes in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the horseshoes didn't come back,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But friends from past competitions do. Wallace says he still
exchanges Christmas cards and insults with a Kansan he met at his
first world tournament 12 years ago in Eau Claire, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just typical of the salt-of-the-earth types you meet in
horseshoes,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Though more likely to forge a friendship than pitch a fit, most
contestants come to the World Horseshoe Tournament already familiar
with the sport's finer points and ready to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out with a flip, but now I throw a turn shoe,''
mused David Crichlow, 39, of Lakewood, N.J., as he pored over an
array of $45 horseshoes designed to meet any pitcher's style.
``I've raised my average _ (the turn shoe) holds more ringers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to playing horseshoes besides just wanting to,''
added Crichlow, who is competing in his first world tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers like Crichlow must have competed in at least four
sanctioned events to qualify for the tourney. World tournaments
tend to bring out more first-time pitchers like Crichlow when held
in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,900 qualifiers competed at Columbus, Ohio in 1992 _
an all-time record in the event's 81-year history. Ontario, Canada,
attracted the event's second largest group _ 1,700 pitchers _ in
1997. The pitchers gathered here will put Greenville right after
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Local entrepreneurs aren't missing the economic opportunities
linked with their visitors. Kids in Christ, a youth group at
Painter Creek Church of the Brethren in Arcanum, is making its
first booth appearance at a world tournament. By collecting cans
and selling drinks, snacks and ice cream to horseshoe pitchers, the
group hopes to offset the cost of attending a national youth
conference in Colorado in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business has been fantastic,'' said Edna Fourman, a church
member. ``The kids are doing it. We're just supervising.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses beyond the fairgrounds also are looking to cash in on
the tournament, which will pump an estimated $3 million to $4
million into the area's economy, said Tracy Tryon, chairman of
Greenville City Council's finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Stardust Motel on Ohio 49 at Greenville's southern edge
hasn't needed its flashing neon star to beckon weary travelers
since the horseshoe tournament kicked off July 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's filled us up for two weeks,'' said Carolyn Irvine, an
assistant at the motel.
</P>
<P>
   With just 178 rooms available in Darke County, many horseshoe
pitchers are lodging in neighboring communities. One-third of the
guests at Troy's Super 8 Motel are in town for the tournament, and
pitchers booked 50 of 62 rooms at the Howard Johnson Express Inn in
Piqua.
</P>
<P>
   During their two-week stay, horseshoe pitchers have been
``regulars'' at Will's Family Dining on Greenville's Wagner Avenue.
The restaurant normally closes at 11 p.m., but will remain open
until midnight through the tournament to accommodate additional
patrons, manager Sheryll Kovacs said.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant employees have been jolted by a few culture shocks
while serving horseshoe pitchers, Kovacs added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelle had a table of three men, and they did not understand
shucking corn,'' Kovacs said. ``It was really neat hearing her tell
them about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Connecticut guys?'' waitress Michelle Lengers chimed in,
still amazed that someone could confuse field corn and sweet corn.
``They were a riot. They had no clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, visitors have taught Greenville that its luck extends
beyond a strong tradition in horseshoe pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCombs, president of the Darke County Horseshoe Club,
recalled a Philadelphia couple who asked him if their children
could play in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a surprised McComb told them, but their next question
about the park made him think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the security?''

 &HT;    Stresses of high school not forgotten _ or are they?
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was the week before our 25th high school
reunion, and the e-mails poured in like distress signals from a
sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last week before this reunion thing and panic is
setting in,'' wrote my friend Janet. ``The letter said the Saturday
night thing would include `games'? What do they mean by this?
Trivial Pursuit? The kinds of idiotic games one plays at Tupperware
parties? Who can name the high school football team members? Also,
what does one wear? Helphelphelphelp .''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to reassure her there would be no such horrors as high
school Jeopardy. The e-mails came anyway:
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last quarter century I've confronted and dealt with a
number of pieces of my past and tried to make my peace with them.
High school, however, is not one of those things. I'm afraid I'll
have flashbacks. Do you know, one of my shrinks actually tried to
diagnose me with post-traumatic stress disorder?''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how many people, from the most popular to the
outcast, experience post-high-school PTSD. What is it about high
school memories that turn normally self-confident adults into great
quivering globs of jellyfish?
</P>
<P>
   Janet, granted, had more reason than most to be apprehensive. We
became friends in 9th grade in part because of natural bookworm
affinity, and in part because nobody else would have us. While I
had been actively ignored, she had been, at times, actively picked
on _ one of those kids too brainy, too head-in-the-clouds, to
comprehend how to navigate the social firmament.
</P>
<P>
   In vain my friends and I tried to convince her that she had
every reason to go to the reunion and gloat _ a great job, great
husband, great life.
</P>
<P>
   But the e-mails kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my hair done for the occasion and told my stylist to
make me look 'successful and sane.' When she said, `Oh no, here
comes the wish list,' I replied, `At least I didn't ask for young
and thin.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the big night arrived, and hundreds of my classmates _
the Kettering Fairmont East class of '74 _ congregated on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived fashionably late to find Janet in a huddle of friends.
I hovered protectively for a minute, but she didn't seem to need
me.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seemed to have exorcised the Ghosts of High School
Past. For Janet, it was a night of revelations, the reunion having
achieved what all her friends had not. All our talk of her
accomplishments had not gotten to the heart of the issue. More
important, she realized, is that since high school ``I have become
a better person _ more stable, more able to deal with people, more
confident, more able to sympathize with and help others, more able
to sustain friendships, more able to try new things.''
</P>
<P>
   The other big revelation: ``Not everyone hated me,'' she said.
``So many people seemed happy to see me and interested in what I'd
been doing that I decided that probably wasn't true after all.''
</P>
<P>
   In adolescence our images are refracted through so many
distorted lights _ the way we see ourselves, the way everyone else
sees us, the way we fancy everyone else sees us.
</P>
<P>
   I recalled a conversation I overheard at the reunion. Two women
dissected high school cliques in descending order of popularity (a
society as exquisitely stratified as any Edith Wharton novel).
Their tone was half amusement, half sociological interest. How
fascinating it all was, and how completely it didn't matter now.
</P>
<P>
   What mattered was that, on a balmy Saturday night, we could all
talk face to face, as adults, as equals, as friends.

 &HT;    Impoverished, laborers count on offerings from 'Egg Lady'
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They call it the day-labor site, this paved lot
with covered benches at the foot of Austin's skyline. Scrub trees
and weeds line a chain-link fence where trash collects. Police cars
frequent the area almost as much as the day laborers and homeless
people. There are smelly, bedhead men with wild eyes. You don't
want to be here if you don't have to _ really, it's an open, giant
trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   The street people here are no better off than the pigeons. And
they both wait for food, because they know it will come.
</P>
<P>
   The Egg Lady is their lone hope this morning.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., she drives into the lot. The men, like the pigeons,
are stirred. Lynn Goodman-Strauss, a portly, gray-haired woman of
53, has barely opened the back seat door when they've formed a line
like choir boys.
</P>
<P>
   The buffet starts at the hood of her 1986 Buick Century, where
she gives the communion of the street: hard-boiled eggs, two H-E-B
tortillas and a banana. Everyone eats: The men get the food, the
pigeons pick at the eggshells discarded on the ground. The line
wraps around to the trunk area, where a Hungry Man-size bottle of
Louisiana Hot Sauce and a salt shaker make the crude breakfast
tacos tastier. This simple offering is their jump-start of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eggs get our bodies going in the morning,'' says Sam
Hernandez, 52, who travels here from Houston to find work. ``But
it's her words that give us hope. She really cares.''
</P>
<P>
   They're Austin's downtrodden, but this devoted crusader sees
goodness. Everyone here is her friend.
</P>
<P>
   Every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday for the past 10 years,
Goodman-Strauss has appeared like clockwork at the corner of Cesar
Chavez and San Antonio streets, where more than 300 men come daily
with hopes of getting picked up to do a variety of odd jobs no one
else wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   Now, her ministry with the city-operated day-labor program is
coming to an end: When the city moves the program to Interstate 35
and 51st Street, her free-breakfast program cannot follow. But
Goodman-Strauss just plans to move to other areas in the city where
people are hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food we provide is a symbol of encouragement and hope that
these men will find work. I can do that anywhere _ that is,
encourage people not to give up,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs are sacred to her; they symbolize resurrection. She finds
it peaceful when she's cooking them. She washes her hands for 20
seconds because she read somewhere that that's how long it takes to
get them completely clean. Then she prays over the 90 eggs she's
stacked so carefully in the blue speckled stockpot. ``Thank you
God, for the animals and the people that make this possible.'' She
brings them to a boil and then cooks them 10 minutes more. ``I used
to like to eat hard-boiled eggs, but I'm sick of them now,'' she
confesses.
</P>
<P>
   She's handed out more than 150,000 over the years.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of why she does it, we need to go back to when
Goodman-Strauss was a 14-year-old attending St. Stephens Episcopal
School in Austin. She was influenced by a chaplain who repeated and
repeated Jesus' teaching that ``those to whom much has been given,
much will be required.'' Then her father went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   She had to wear second-hand clothes, and people at church bought
her school supplies. She found out what it was like to be in need.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1967 on a trip to New York City with her then-husband,
Goodman-Strauss visited Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker program,
founded during the Depression on the principle of Matthew 35 and
36: (ITAL) ``For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I
was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you
invited Me in; I was naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you
visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.'' (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   With a 6-week-old child in her arms, Goodman-Strauss found
herself fascinated with the soup line. ``The people giving the food
knew the people getting the food,'' she recalls. The experience
took root and never left her.
</P>
<P>
   Then when she was 25 and already the mother of two boys,
complications from a miscarriage sent her into a coma. She saw this
``wonderful light'' she knows was God. He told her this was the
only time she'd ever have the choice of coming toward the light or
going back to her family. ``I could hear the loving voices of
angels and saints,'' she says. God showed her her babies in a field
with their father walking toward her. They were all getting older
as they got closer. ``I said, 'I want to go back to my babies.'''
That is where her near-death experience ended. That day at Seton
Hospital changed her. She converted to Catholicism from her
Episcopal upbringing, at about the same time that she and her
husband divorced. That prompted a 1972 trip to London to get a
teaching degree in the Montessori method. And that led to a job at
Austin's Cristo Rey Catholic Church working with Spanish-speaking
children. There, she learned the Spanish that is so important to
her work on the street. In 1981, she earned a history degree at the
University of Texas and took a job as an administrative assistant
in the College of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1989 when the memorable experience of Day's Catholic
Worker operation in New York City re-emerged with a vengeance. She
thought about it even more when she drove by the day-labor site.
For months, she agonized about the idea. ``I didn't want to do it;
I was afraid,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She prayed about it daily and one spring morning got the courage
to go there. She remembers being uneasy that first day when she
walked among the men to ask them if she brought them food, would
they eat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she was crazy but wonderful,'' says Chico Gonzalez,
48, who saw her there.
</P>
<P>
   She returned the next day with two dozen hard-boiled eggs and
tortillas. They went fast. The grass-roots Egg McMinistry quickly
grew to 10 dozen eggs daily. She enlisted the help of volunteers
from St. George's Episcopal Church to meet the growing demand.
(Bill Wilkerson, a member of the church, was inspired. He still
delivers eggs, tortillas and coffee to the day-labor area on
Fridays.)
</P>
<P>
   The men dubbed her ``The Egg Lady,'' which she accepted as some
kind of honor. She now had a street name, just like Indian Joe and
Bicycle Scotty. She was one of them. They shared their tales of
weekend revelry, falling in love and getting arrested for one thing
or another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, she quit her UT job and got on a train to visit
Catholic Worker programs in the western United States. She returned
to open Mary House Catholic Worker _ really her 672-square-foot
home west of downtown. She had the blessing of Bishop John McCarthy
of the Diocese of Austin, who kicked in $100 of his own money and
$1,000 from the diocese so she could officially start the ministry
she already had been financing with her savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like the work of Mother Teresa,'' says McCarthy. ``She
just wants to lessen their pain and make them feel appreciated and
respected.''
</P>
<P>
   It works, says James Stewart, 28, a homeless man: ``We hear so
many putdowns every day about what terrible people we are. She
makes us feel like we're somebody.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop's seed money lasted but a few months. Goodman-Strauss
found herself challenged to keep the ministry going.
</P>
<P>
   She did, though. News of her kind work reached the Christian
community. Small donations came in. The most meaningful donation to
Goodman-Strauss came from a homeless man who gave her a quarter.
She was tempted to return it but kept it to preserve his dignity.
Today, the meager, but steady, stream of private money pays for the
ministry, which operates on $16,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly developed a reputation among agencies that help the
homeless as savvy with street people who have mental disabilities.
David Gomez, the program manager for ACCESS, an Austin-Travis
County program for homeless mentally ill people, initially referred
people to Goodman-Strauss. ``She would take in our most vulnerable
clients and work magic with them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman-Strauss says it was the work of her black cat, Arabella,
whom she calls a psychiatrist, because Arabella would sit by
troubled people and calm them.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Hose, the former associate pastor of St. Mary's Cathedral,
met her in 1992. ``With Lynn's help, I came to understand that the
homeless were as much a part of daily parish life as anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The words of two men 10 years ago keep her going: ``You know,
this is the only time in my life when I get something and no one
wants anything in return,'' one said. And the other: ``This is the
only time I haven't had to fill out a form for someone to talk to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   She thinks about those two men on the days she's not 100 percent
into her work. First of all, she says, she's not a morning person,
but you can't tell it from her banter with the men, a lot of it in
Spanish. She's not feeling well some of the time because she has
chronic asthma. When it's cold, she's tested but reminded of
Dorothy Day's teaching ``that if you don't have the love, you don't
give out the bread.''
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of a free breakfast program at the new day-labor
site will affect more people than Goodman-Strauss. City officials
have been talking with Wilkerson of St. George's church, who
delivers food on Friday morning, and members of St. Mary's
Cathedral, who bring breakfast on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman-Strauss has heard enough, though. ``They're worried free
food attracts other people who come just for the food, not to find
work. I can respect that. I won't take this personally. I will miss
the guys, though,'' she says. (City officials maintain the men
themselves asked to end the program.)
</P>
<P>
   When the new day-labor site opens Aug. 1, Goodman-Strauss will
simply take food to another location, a place on Seventh Street
behind the police station where other day laborers congregate.
</P>
<P>
   And it's times like these that strengthen her and push her to do
more than just feed the men in the morning. She collects clothing
and distributes it to programs like the Austin Resource Center for
the Homeless. She coordinates what she calls ``slumber parties'' at
a local church for homeless people on cold nights. She's taken in
battered women.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez at ACCESS knows more: ``She'd coordinate churches to cook
lunches for our clients. She'd come with all this stuff in her car
and home-cooked meals. She served and cleaned up. During the
winter, she does a blanket drive for people on the street. She
doesn't ask stores for donations of food or clothing. ``This work
belongs to the individuals and churches who support it, and I'm
accountable to them. I'm working on their behalf, and that's a
privilege,'' she says. And there is a life outside her street
ministry. Friends and contributors to her program sometimes take
her out to dinner or a movie. Some mornings, she lives it up at Nau
Enfield Drug on West Lynn by splurging on a 75-cent cup of coffee.
It's a luxury to have someone else make the coffee, pour it and
wash the cup afterward. It's an even bigger deal to get a $2.50
breakfast special or find a discarded New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   She calls Nau Enfield Drug a ``village,'' where everyone knows
and cares about each other. One day, an old man couldn't read a
number in the phone book. One of the waitresses put her work down,
read the number and wrote it down in big print for the man to see.
When Goodman-Strauss' brother, Joe, died in 1996, employees and
regulars sent flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is so '50s in here. You can get a Cherry Coke, a root
beer float and the best banana split in town,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling recharged, she heads out in her car with 174,000 miles
on the odometer to collect more stuff that will help people. Lessen
their pain. Help their situation.
</P>
<P>
   And to boil more eggs to take the growl out of their stomachs.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They are little girls in pink polyester
nighties, sisters who ought to already be asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we take our nightgowns home?''4-year-old Veronica is
saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want some green shoes. Go look. Go get some,'' says
3-year-old Nina, a slightly smaller version of her sister with
straight bangs fringing dark eyes. Then, ``I want to wear these to
bed.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a little after 10 p.m., and in darkened bedrooms down the
hall, other children lie in their beds. But the sisters and their
older brother were late arrivals at the Austin Children's Shelter _
a way station for kids who are removed from their homes, usually
because they have been abused or neglected.
</P>
<P>
   So the girls _ whose family background includes allegations of
sexual abuse _ sit on the floor in a bedroom choosing shoes, as
shelter supervisor Sherree Paschall gently eases them into bed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after Paschall dims the light and begins
reading ``101 Dalmatians,'' Nina begins flailing around in her bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``MOMMY-MOMMY-MOMMY-MOMMY. . .'' she screams, hair flying, wide
eyes scanning the unfamiliar, darkened room.
</P>
<P>
   The sobbing only subsides after Paschall invites her to come sit
in her lap. Even then, her body convulses with each breath.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nina points to the shoes lined up across the room, shudders
a final time and pronounces, ``Those are mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about what fun things we'll do tomorrow,'' Paschall
says softly, after both girls are lying quietly in their beds. Her
hands lightly circle each child's back as they fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ring around the rosies,'' she says. ``Bubbles . . . ride bikes
. . . hokey pokey . . . eat breakfast . . . roller skates.''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice trails off into a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   And the sweet images ward off the darkness of night.
</P>
<P>
   Where kids can be kids
</P>
<P>
   Daylight brings the controlled chaos of 30 children and
teen-agers who live in the Austin Children's Shelter's adjoining
houses at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   They are babies, school-age children, as old as 17 when they
come here to spend a month, on average, before packing up again to
go to a foster home or to live with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   They come here if a judge agrees with a caseworker that it's too
dangerous for them to stay with their parents or caretakers. They
come here when they have nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old becomes so frightened when her parents start
fighting that she runs out of the house, carrying her baby sister
in an infant car seat. The baby isn't strapped in and falls out,
smashing her head on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   They are here.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-year-old and his younger sister are living with their
grandfather, who gets arrested. The kids go to stay with other
relatives, but the boy begins wearing makeup and says he may be
gay, and the little girl is acting out.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives decide the kids are too much to handle.
</P>
<P>
   They are here.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a 9-year-old boy, drowning in a too-big T-shirt and
pants that bag around his ankles. Sitting outside in a wooden
playhouse at the shelter, he says he likes math, science, and fairy
tales. And then he says, about his mother's boyfriend: ``He beats
up women when he's drunk. My mom thinks he's gonna be nice forever,
but they change, you know. Once you live with them, they change.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later the boy is gone, replaced by some other child
with a heart-rending history _ the mentally retarded toddler with a
broken collarbone, the 17-year-old working as a prostitute who's
never been to school.
</P>
<P>
   The staff, volunteers and others who support this place can't be
mothers and fathers, exactly.
</P>
<P>
   But here, at least, children can be children, children can be
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Always more need
</P>
<P>
   Two toddlers caught in the revolving door of emergency care are
here one busy Friday afternoon in June: A blond 2-year-old in a
seersucker jumpsuit is leaving, walking hand in hand with her
caseworker from Child Protective Services, a division of the
state's Department of Protective and Regulatory Services. She had
spent the night after her baby brother was hospitalized because of
suspected abuse, and now is going to stay with her grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Shelter I supervisor Sherree Paschall appears in
the same doorway, carrying a new admission, a sleepy toddler still
wearing a hospital gown.
</P>
<P>
   James' caseworker reports that the boy has a skull fracture,
that he's been asleep since about 11 a.m. (Children's names have
been changed for this story.) Then, as the 2-year-old is taken to
change clothes and eat supper, she details a family tree that fits
many of the kids here: parents, grandparents and other relatives
with abusive histories.
</P>
<P>
   James clings to the arms of yet another staff member as he
enters a room full of children. (Paschall has moved on to care for
another little boy who is getting ready to go to the hospital
because his temperature keeps climbing.)
</P>
<P>
   His older brother, admitted the night before, doesn't
acknowledge him. The 2-year-old's brows are knitted intently as he
takes in the children, corralled in the older kids' living room
because of work being done next door. There are more than a half
dozen babies, toddlers and preschoolers, two or three staff members
and a volunteer _ and the kids are everywhere, watching cartoons,
climbing on couches, tossing a ball back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   A little girl who's barely walking opens a video cabinet and
begins dragging out the contents. A 4-year-old flashes her eyes and
wags her bottom back and forth against a stranger's legs, a
provocative gesture typical of children who've been sexually
abused.
</P>
<P>
   A staffer snips the hospital bracelet from James' cocoa-brown
arm, which still bears traces of sticky white tape. James is quiet
but his liquid eyes are bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   He begins howling a few minutes later, as everyone gathers
around the supper table for brisket and beans. James won't eat
unless he's cuddled in someone's lap. Clearly his head hurts, but a
bureaucratic glitch keeps the staff from getting prescribed
medicine to him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, the seasoned shelter employee working the phones to
get him what he needs, breaks down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   One child. One afternoon. Somebody waiting to take his place.
</P>
<P>
   Since the day it opened in 1984, the Austin Children's Shelter
has struggled to keep up with the demands of a community with so
many children in need. The nonprofit shelter _ in a residential
neighborhood not far from downtown _ is supported by money from the
state, county and city, as well as from grants, foundations and
private donations. It takes in children from 30 counties, but 95
percent of the kids it serves are from Austin and Travis County,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And, with just two other shelters in the Austin area (in Round
Rock and Pflugerville), the same booming population that's crowding
our highways is causing a pileup of abuse and neglect cases, says
state District Judge Scott McCown.
</P>
<P>
   The problem can be simply stated if not easily solved: Not
enough foster homes for all the Central Texas kids who need them,
and not enough shelter beds for interim emergency care and
assessment. Until September, the Austin shelter had just 15 beds;
it immediately filled 15 more beds in a second house that opened
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter is expected to serve 400 kids this year, but will
have turned away nearly 200 in the same period. That means local
kids are being placed in shelters far from their homes and schools,
in places like San Antonio and Waco, or with relatives or in foster
homes that may or may not be a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   And the shelter is bracing for even more calls from CPS
caseworkers before the year is over. The good news is that more
money from the Legislature that McCown pushed for will mean more
resources for child abuse investigation. The bad news is that the
shortage of foster homes and shelter beds will be felt even more
acutely. Compounding the urgency: The number of Texas children who
died from abuse or neglect increased more than 70 percent between
1997 and 1998, according to a state study.
</P>
<P>
   Like a real home
</P>
<P>
   McCown pictured something out of Charles Dickens when he first
began hearing child abuse cases and learned of the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he soon found himself ``so touched by how homelike it
is,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The kids in Shelter II _ a light-filled, older home with
gleaming wood floors _ start waking up around 6 or 7 a.m.,
depending on their schedules. They sleep four to a room in bunk
beds, in rooms without doors, and the staff member on duty sits
outside in the hallway keeping an eye on things.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:50 a.m., most of them have brushed their teeth, found
something to wear and made it downstairs to eat breakfast before
boarding a bus to summer school.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered around a big wooden table covered with breakfast dishes
and boxes of cereal _ Razzle Dazzle Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes
and Kellogg's Corn Pops _ the kids talk about what they want to be
when they grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Radiologist. Lawyer. Navy SEAL.
</P>
<P>
   Shawnda, the youngest, an 8-year-old with a head full of
pigtails, has been angling for attention all morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I'm gonna be? You know what I'm gonna be?'' she
says, trying to be heard above the conversation and clinking of
spoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna fly,'' she says, flapping her arms like a bird.
``I'm gonna be a fish. I wanna be a bird, a dolphin, a whale. I
wanna be one of these,'' she says, poking at her Corn Pops.
</P>
<P>
   For the staff, this is a low-stress morning. The biggest
concerns among the 15 children are one needy, overly imaginative
kid, a boy who took a dive off his bunk bed, a dawdling pre-teen
who didn't want to get up, and a teen-ager with a cassette tape of
music with foul language that had to be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   But when the kids first arrive, ``they're very frightened,''
says executive director Susan Wills. ``What they know about
grown-ups are that they are people they can't trust or who hurt
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And the kids often come in with physical and emotional wounds in
need of immediate attention. The staff tries to divert children
with severe problems to hospitals. But it's not unusual for someone
to be admitted wearing a body cast, or healing from a bad burn, or
stab wounds. Maybe they need to be shown how to use a nebulizer for
asthma that's never been treated. Occasionally a younger child will
come in with internal injuries no one has identified.
</P>
<P>
   One child became injured while at the shelter, but ``never made
a sound,'' Wills says. ``They have learned if they cry out, they'll
get beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   The shelter responds to the tumult of the kids' backgrounds with
structured surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The stability is itself therapeutic. And here the kids learn
about rules, about setting boundaries and about people who care
about their well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone participates in group therapy, and many of the kids
also have individual counseling at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   There are meetings with caseworkers, supervised visits with
parents, phone calls to grandparents. The shelter connects kids
with appropriate social service agencies and makes recommendations
to CPS about what kind of foster home or residential treatment
facility might be best for them when they leave.
</P>
<P>
   Behavior is molded, in part, by a point system, with points
subtracted for not following rules. And kids can trade a surplus of
points for perks or small prizes like cameras or toys. The children
in both shelters also operate according to a ``stoplight'' system.
Kids who listen and follow rules are on green light, with the most
privileges. Those on red light aren't allowed on field trips and
have the earliest bedtimes.
</P>
<P>
   Success is measured in tiny increments _ a 12-year-old who
sleeps through the night without wetting his bed, a child who
learns to ask for a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their bleak backgrounds, or perhaps because of them, the
atmosphere inspired by the children here is light-filled, not
dreary and dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the horror,'' says Wills, ``but there's a level of joy
that's very life-affirming.''
</P>
<P>
   One hot spring morning the little kids are running around
outside playing and a 16-month-old, small for her age, is sitting
on the ground, sifting rocks through her tiny fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Something in her eyes warns you away, sizes you up.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, she is reserved and cautious and rarely smiles. But
by the time she and her older siblings leave the shelter for a
foster home more than a month later, she is toddling around at top
speed, grinning at strangers and asking to be picked up.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you plant a seed that they're loved, that they're
important, that it's not their fault,'' Wills says, ``they remember
it all of their life.''
</P>
<P>
   Never enough help
</P>
<P>
   In Shelter I, where up to 15 younger children eat, sleep and
play, keeping up with the breakfast dishes, juice cups, baths and
dirty diapers _ not to mention temper tantrums that send kids
running under beds and occasional angry outbursts _ can seem a
never-ending challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter depends on 90 to 100 volunteers, who donate at least
eight hours a month. But there are never enough arms here, or next
door, where the kids are bigger and more independent, but needy
just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members are trained to connect, but not cling too tightly.
Even so, their jobs can seem overwhelming. Average employment here
is about seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to work at Whataburger, and not have to deal with
the emotional trauma of working with children who have been beaten
within an inch of their life,'' Wills says.
</P>
<P>
   Instability recently hit the shelter's executive branch as well:
Wills, the director for eight years, has been asked to take an
administrative leave by the nonprofit's board.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Oliver Smith would not comment on Wills' leadership
except to say that the children's care has not been in question.
Smith said the board is working to identify a consultant to help
assess the shelter's ``organizational structure,'' in light of its
significant growth in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Wills has made it a priority to raise the shelter's profile in
the community in the past few years. There have been many generous
gifts: The Meadows Foundation this year paid off remaining debt on
the new shelter building. Elmar Prambs, executive chef of the Four
Seasons, comes once a week to prepare supper for the staff and
kids. Numerous businesses help pay for field trips to theme parks
and other places.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a growing number of children with nowhere else to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Wills has watched as community members have stepped forward to
support the arts in recent months. ``Maybe there'll be a gift of a
home for these kids we're having to turn away,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to take care of Austin is to take care of kids at
risk,'' Wills says. ``There are many great causes in Austin, but
none greater than our children.''
</P>
<P>
   She keeps a collection of drawings and letters from children
who've stayed at the shelter but are long gone. There's a crayoned
thank-you note scrawled by a child who said she was happy to be in
a place where someone would wake and feed her each day.
</P>
<P>
   One 9-year-old boy came to the shelter after police found him
driving around town, peering over the steering wheel of a car from
his perch atop a thick phonebook. His mother, a prostitute, had a
drug habit, and his older brother had recently been shot and
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel happy to be here,'' he wrote. ``It is fun to be safe.''

   YOSEMITE-KILLINGS (San Francisco) _ As a U.S. senator and the
relatives of victims questioned the FBI's investigation into four
murders that have shaken Yosemite National Park, a cab driver who
gave the confessed killer a two-hour ride from one of the crime
scenes said the bureau had failed to contact her. By SETH
ROSENFELD.

   SUTURES (Undated) _ A medical manufacturer has been hit with a
new flurry of lawsuits in connection with an infection outbreak
allegedly caused by contaminated surgical sutures. In two
class-action suits, seven surgical patients in California and
Nevada charged that they had suffered raging infections because the
Johnson &AMP; Johnson subsidiary Ethicon Inc. allegedly distributed
sutures contaminated with infectious bacteria. By LANCE WILLIAMS.

   SF-MAYOR (San Francisco) _ San Francisco police Capt. Richard
Cairns, whose role in the 1989 police sweep of Castro Street
resulted in his suspension from the force, has picked up papers
declaring his intent to run for mayor. Cairns has until Aug. 6 to
officially enter the race. Twenty-five people already have declared
their intent to run. By GREGORY LEWIS.

   PC-USERS (San Francisco) _ Despite high-tech industry hype about
computers becoming the focus of our future, users really want their
machines to become everyday household appliances, helping them do
the laundry, stand in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles and
handle other mundane chores. By MATT BEER.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-BUSINESS (San Francisco) _ About two years ago, Veronica
Ruiz had a Web site for her business, a supply and repair store for
typewriters and fax machines, but she got tired of paying $78 a
month to a Web posting company for nothing. Ruiz's frustration with
the Web is fairly typical of small businesses. By VICTORIA

   RAC-BETTING (Saratoga Springs, N.Y.) _ If you're worried when
placing a bet on the horses, just think of the clerk who takes the
money at the betting window. If the clerk makes a mistake, he or
she must pay for it. The largest error last year cost one unlucky
bet taker $1,500, close to the $2,000 clerks may earn in a season.
By LINDA TRISCHITT.

<P>
   FBN-NINERS (Stockton, Calif.) _ Given the way Jim
Druckenmiller's career has played out with the 49ers, the swell of
camera crews and reporters clamoring for his insights on Tuesday

<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ As the population ages and the
cost of medical care shoots up, health insurers struggle to save
money while physicians and patients struggle to obtain adequate
care. At the moment, all three sides in this epic clash seem to be
losing. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   FERRIES (San Francisco) _ Plans for a huge expansion of ferry
service in the Bay Area ignore problems caused by ferry boats. Even
the most modern ferries are 10 times more polluting per passenger
than recently built cars, and 34 times more polluting than the
natural-gas bus designs proposed for Golden Gate Transit.
High-speed ferries would also increase safety risk and create large
wakes that erode shorelines. By RUSSELL LONG.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 Monkeying around inside the computer  
 By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I lost the jewel case my Windows CD came in. I
want to reinstall Windows, but I know I'm going to need the
registration key that's on the back of the case. _ Pain by Numbers
</P>
<P>
   Dear Pain: As long as your current installation is still
running, you can find that key buried deep within the Registry, but
I really hate telling people how to poke around in there. It's like
leaving a monkey alone in your house with a jackhammer and a fifth
of bourbon: Even though Bobo means well, you can bet your Elvis
commemorative plate is going to wind up in several million pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But, if you absolutely have to know that key, here goes. All you
software-bootlegger wannabes, please go read Hints From Heloise for
about 10 minutes. It's not that I don't trust you not to churn out
several thousand copies of Windows with your brand new CD burners,
but I hear Heloise has some really cool advice about what to do
with old coffee grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Geez, those guys were gullible! Now that we've gotten rid of
them, put your jackhammer down, pick Run from the Start menu and
type in Regedit.
</P>
<P>
   In the left pane, you have an Explorerlike list of folders.
Double-click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to open it, then open the
following subfolders in this sequence: Software, Microsoft,
Windows, CurrentVersion. Now in the right panel look for ProductKey
and you'll see the magic number next to it.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you're here, there a few harmless things you can play
with, but if you break something, I'm going to deny I told you how.
In fact, you might want to practice on your boss's computer. Try
changing RegisteredOwner and RegisteredOrganization by
right-clicking on them, selecting Modify, then typing in new
values, like ``Boneheaded Jerk'' and ``Two-Bit Operation.'' I'm
sure the boss will get as much of a kick out of that little
surprise as you will.
</P>
<P>
   Ooops! The bootleggers are finished with Heloise. And that is
why even attempting to open the Registry will send simultaneous
alerts to Microsoft and the FBI, resulting in your arrest and
prosecution. Glad to help!
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: My Programs menu isn't alphabetized anymore.
Can't Microsoft get anything right? _ A to Z
</P>
<P>
   Dear A: Eventually they do, but it takes a while. I'm still
waiting for them to finish debugging Windows 2.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, stuff should be alphabetized in your Programs and
Favorites menus, but unruly installation programs have a tendency
to goof up the Registry settings that take care of that. Please
don't go barging into the Registry like that last guy, unless you
know what you're doing, and believe me, you probably don't.
</P>
<P>
   Go download Internet Explorer 5 from Microsoft even if you hate
using IE. You're not only downloading a browser, you're also
getting several system enhancements, including the ability to
right-click on an open menu and alphabetize it.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're absolutely dead-set against IE, Windows 98 allows
you to drag Program menu items around so you can put them in order
yourself. Put your cursor on the item, hold the left mouse button
down and drag to your heart's content. Of course, this assumes that
you have at least a passing familiarity with the alphabet.
Considering where you've come for help, I find that entirely
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   (Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay hammered his own
Registry this week. Are you really going to take advice from this
idiot? Send taunting limericks to drbombay(AT)star-telegram.com or

APPLICATIONS THAT ADVERTISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIFWorks and 3DTextMaker are two neat programs for creating
images to put on Web pages. But these programs also represent
fundamental change in the direction of desktop computing _ a change
that might ultimately make more software available at lower prices
for everyone, while making them more annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they could simply be momentary economic aberrations.
It's really too early to tell for sure.
</P>
<P>
   GIFWorks and 3DTextMaker, developed by Andover.Net in South
Acton, Mass., are Web-based applications. Unlike normal
applications, which you download and run on your computer, these
two are run through a Web browser while you are connected to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   GIFWorks is the simpler program of the two. It can rotate
images, resize them, or apply a number of different ``effects,''
such as embossing or sharpening. The program also has a number of
features that are optimized for Web page creation: You can reduce
the number of colors, or create an animated GIF. Andover has also
put together a large collection of images that you can freely
incorporate into your own Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   3DTextMaker is a program for making buttons with text that go on
Web pages. You choose a font, a color, and effect, and add some
text. Then you click a button and the Web site creates a button or
a banner with the text that you requested. Once you make a button,
you can then save it to your computer's hard drive, or you can
click a link, take the program back into GIFWorks, and make further
changes to it there. Or you can click a menu item that says ``FTP
Transload'' and send the image to Web site using the Internet's
File Transfer Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   GIFWorks and 3DTextMaker are just two of the applications that
the folks at Andover.Net have put together for building Web sites.
Another application is ButtonMaker, which turns a GIF into a
button. There also is FontMapper, a simple utility that shows how
different characters are displayed in different fonts. And there is
HTMLWorks, a program that lets you edit the HTML code on your Web
page, save it back to your Web server, and validate _ that is, to
check it to make sure that there aren't any errors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Andover's programs are a bit buggy _ for example, I
couldn't get the ``sharpen'' feature in GIFWorks to work properly.
Others are somewhat limited. But fortunately, since these are
Web-based applications, all Andover has to do is fix the program.
Unlike a traditional software publisher, such as Microsoft, Andover
doesn't have take the time or spend the money to distribute the
fixed program to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference between the Andover Web-based
applications and traditional computer apps is the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Andover.Net is a network of advertiser-supported Web sites.
Every time you click a button on the GIFWorks or 3DTextMaker Web
page, a new banner advertisement appears at the top of the screen.
According to the company's rate card, these ads cost between $42
and $70 for every thousand impressions. Those rates may seem rather
high; Andover justifies its prices by saying that 41 percent of its
Web site visitors work in information technology, and 69 percent
are personally responsible for purchasing computer products for
their companies.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue adds up quickly for Web-based applications.
For example, a typical session with GIFWorks might involve clicking
50 menu items, which translates to roughly $2 in revenue. Use the
program to design even a small Web site and you might earn $20 or
more for the company. Use Andover's tools religiously for a few
months, and you could earn hundreds of dollars for them.
</P>
<P>
   These economics stand in stark contrast to the way traditional
application programs are sold. Consider Adobe ImageStyler, a
program that is far more sophisticated than the Web-based
applications that Andover has put together. ImageStyler has a
retail price of $130, of which Adobe probably sees less than $100.
So while Andover's programs may be ``free'' for the user, they
ultimately cost far more than the alternative. The cost is hidden
because the user doesn't pay _ the advertiser does.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this situation can be stable for very long.
Something has to give. One possibility is that Andover's
advertisements are overpriced. Andover's claims that its Web site
visitors are decision-makers may be true, but most of the
advertisements that I have seen on the 3DTextMaker Web site are for
instant-win sweepstakes, low-cost telephone cards, Web-based email
services, and the Women's World Wrestling Federation. Ultimately,
the company many not be able to justify the cost of its
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another way the economics could work out. We might
start seeing advertisements in other applications as well.
</P>
<P>
   For example, my copy of Quicken '99 shows me ads when I download
stock quotes and news stories from the Internet. (You are supposed
to be able to turn off the ads, but for some reason that feature of
Quicken '99 doesn't work for me.) Another program that comes
prewired to display advertising is the new ``G2 Player'' from
RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   A few years from now, paid advertisements might be a standard
part of most desktop applications. After all, advertising is an
untapped and potentially large source of revenue for software
publishers. This potential might be difficult for them to resist.
</P>
<P>
   There might be two versions of Adobe's ImageStyler program in
the future: a low-cost version that shows advertisements, and a
high-cost version that doesn't. Ultimately, our computer screens
might resemble the signs along a typical highway, with a few
rectangles devoted to the actual business of desktop computing, and
the rest of the rectangles devoted to the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a future that I eagerly await.

THE PROFITS OF COOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The latest edition of the twice-annual Macworld magic
show began with one marvelous bit of illusion-busting and ended
with another.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who entered stage left without any warning really did
look like Apple Computer Inc.'s own Steve Jobs. He had it all just
right, even the little Asian-looking bow with folded hands as he
acknowledged the plaudits of the crowd. Well, he didn't have it all
just right, because the real Steve Jobs came charging out with an
impromptu critique. Actor Noah Wyle, who recently played Jobs in a
TV movie, accepted the criticism in good grace and got out of
there.
</P>
<P>
   On with the show! Darn good one, too. Jobs' genius as a pitchman
came through from the start, as he danced lightly over Apple's
recent superb sales figures and excellent finances. The days of
harping on that stuff are done. Apple's back. Let's talk product.
</P>
<P>
   There were interesting offerings in the streaming multimedia
field, and a promising hint of good things to come later this year
in the next version of the Mac operating system _ not the fabled OS
X, alas. There wasn't a word about that lusty spawn of Unix. Pity,
but we can wait.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the star turn was reserved for the long-awaited
Apple consumer laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Even Apple skeptics like me had held out a lot of hope for this
one, based on fond memories of eMate, the 1996 minilaptop that
struck me as Apple's best hardware product in years. This
three-pound, $800 baby was crude, with a black-and-white screen, a
slow processor, no disk drives, and little memory. It didn't even
run the Mac OS. What it did do was let you get your e-mail, do some
primitive Web surfing, and type text for hours without even
thinking about recharging the battery. Just the thing for a writer
on the road. I didn't buy one because I knew Apple, then in
desperate straits, would kill the product.
</P>
<P>
   But when Jobs last year vowed to bring out a true consumer
laptop, my hopes rose. Sure, they'd go for something fancier than
an eMate. But if they could capture that same bare-bones esthetic,
and hit nearly the same price point, the computer world might
finally have its first peoples' laptop.
</P>
<P>
   And so when Jobs showed off Apple's gaudy new iBook laptops, a
part of me couldn't help but feel disillusioned. It was bigger than
I'd hoped for, more powerful than I'd expected, and at $1,600, much
pricier than I'd desired.
</P>
<P>
   How dare Apple make a better, hotter machine than I'd expected?
Maybe it's this odd new habit the company has recently acquired _
making money. Right now, nobody has proven there's a profitable
market for proletarian laptops. As Apple product manager Dave
Russell pointed out to me, the few there are tend to be based on
obsolete PC technology and don't sell very well. Apple has learned
well the bitter lessons of the past few years; they're not into
loss leaders.
</P>
<P>
   So the heck with a cheap, stripped machine. The iBook, to judge
by the specs and a few tentative keytaps, is a powerful machine,
with a 300-megahertz Power PC processor and an ATI Rage chip for
strong 3D graphics performance.
</P>
<P>
   Coolest of all is a $99 upgrade that turns any iBook into a
wireless network computer. Add a $299 device that looks like a
pearl-gray flying saucer, and you can have a roomful of these
things chattering away at each other with not a foot of Ethernet
cable among them. This feature alone will sell a couple hundred
thousand iBooks. Indeed, they'll sell as many of these computers as
they can make, and at a fatter profit than they'd make off some
cheap Prole-Pad.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook can stand on its own without the excesses of Jobsian
hype. He calls it the world's second-fastest laptop, exceeded only
by one of Apple's own PowerBooks. But that claim's based on
``pure'' processing speed, not real-world performance using
standard programs. Apple should give it a rest. The iBook is plenty
fast. There's no need to exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   And no need to kowtow to tightwads like me, who came expecting
cheap computers from a company that specializes in cool computers.
As Apple keeps proving, cool may not be cheap, but it's mighty
profitable.

FOR SOME, THE WAIT IS AS EXCITING AS THE MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people count down the days until their wedding or the last
day of school. Others anticipate the call from the doctor or the
visit from Santa. And in theater circles, folks have been known to
wait for Lefty and some guy named Godot.
</P>
<P>
   But wait for a movie? It used to be that only Trekkers and
aspiring Jedi knights obsessed about the minute details of their
favorite films. But now, it seems like every movie is dissected on
the Internet months before it even opens. Of course you expect
advance mania with ``Star Wars.'' But the Net has buzzed all summer
with feverish speculation about movies big and small, from ``Wild
Wild West'' to ``The Blair Witch Project.'' A movie isn't just a
movie anymore: It's an Event. Anticipation has become a popular
pastime, a form of entertainment in itself. Buzz is the new
buzzword, waiting the new game.
</P>
<P>
   Take Tim Doyle. Two years ago, he was an ad salesman in Toronto,
going about his business and seeing the occasional film. Today,
he's on an ``extended vacation'' in Los Angeles, putting together a
business plan for countingdown.com, the Web site that breathlessly
reports on upcoming films. ``We have mobilized anticipation in a
more organized fashion,'' Doyle, 28, says of the site, which he
launched with two other film buffs.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big day for Doyle and his cohorts, what with the
opening of the long-awaited Stanley Kubrick film ``Eyes Wide
Shut.'' They've been counting down to the opening for months,
dishing out the latest rumors about stars Nicole Kidman and Tom
Cruise and castigating Warner Brothers for digitally altering a
65-second orgy scene. Who cares if the film is worth the wait? The
wait is worth the wait to Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like opening presents before Christmas, sneaking a
peak,'' he explains of this Information Age obsession. ``It's like
a guilty pleasure, like being let in on some deep, dark secret.''
</P>
<P>
   And every day is Christmas Eve in cyberspace. The film industry
was slow to respond to the Internet phenomenon, but fans are now
rewriting the rules about movie premieres. Nothing is secret, and
reviews are not embargoed. Amateur sites like aint-it-cool-news.com
and darkhorizons.com publish anything they can dredge up about
upcoming films, and industry honchos are flinching about their loss
of spin control. Last month, director Barry Sonnenfeld blamed the
Internet for the tepid response to ``Wild Wild West.'' ``You can
ruin a movie through anonymous reviews on the Internet,'' he said,
failing to note that the mainstream press didn't exactly embrace
the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that can make or break a film is the film
itself,'' says Lew Harris, editor-in-chief of E! Online. But even
Harris, whose site fuels the obsession with pop culture, says the
buzz has escalated this month. ``There is an increasing mania, and
I don't know where it's going to end,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, it's not going to end. You know the line between
fact and fiction is blurring when a film becomes an urban legend in
its own right. That's what happened with ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' a mock documentary by independent filmmakers Daniel
Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. The film tells the story of three
students who disappear while making a documentary about witches in
Blair, Md. The whole thing is fiction, but you wouldn't know it
from the Web site (www.blairwitch.com). The site draws you into the
mythology, presenting ``evidence'' including photographs and
weathered documents. There isn't a single clue that the legend
isn't true, except for one link that leads to an on-line store
where you can purchase T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly an ingenious, if manipulative, marketing ploy,
since word flies on the Internet. A few weeks ago, the ``Blair
Witch Project'' appeared on www.snopes.com, a popular site that
debunks urban legends that multiply in cyberspace. David Mikkelson,
who runs the site with his wife, Barbara, says he set up the
``Blair Witch'' page as a response to numerous inquiries. ``We
still have plenty of folks who will cling to whatever beliefs fit
their world view, facts be damned,'' Mikkelson says.
</P>
<P>
   It's only a movie, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. Rumors and legends about movies aren't the only
things that proliferate in cyberspace these days. An avid fan
posted the complete footage of ``Phantom Menace'' on line days
after the film opened; a streaming video version of the last
episode of ``Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,'' which had been postponed
because of the Columbine High tragedy in Colorado, appeared on line
immediately after it was aired on Canadian television.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to wait for Christmas morning anymore. So now that
the folks at countingdown.com finally get to see ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' they have something else to anticipate. Remember those 65
seconds? The scene that was altered to mask body parts in an orgy
scene? The film is being released uncensored in Europe, so it's
only a matter of time before someone sneaks a camera into a theater
and posts the original clip on line. It will happen, guaranteed.
All you have to do is wait.

----- &QC;  With all due respect to Marshall McLuhan, the medium is the
medium _ at least in an Internet seance.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, we checked out ``Web Seance,'' the latest project
by digital artists Nina Sobell and Emily Hartzell that was
commissioned by the Banff Center for the Arts in Alberta, Canada.
Two artists were hooked up to an electroencephalographic machine,
which traces electronic forces in the brain, and drawings of their
brainwaves were transmitted to the Web site. On-line participants
asked questions that scrolled across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings themselves were abstract blurs, eerie and
incandescent. The questions were amusing, a combination of mishegas
and mysticism. A sampling: ``Can I touch the medium?'' and ``Is
this a medium or a comedian?'' I logged in late, posing the query:
``Is this over?'' Alas, the medium didn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   The site is at http://artists.banff.org/parkbench/seance/; the
next seance is set for July 28 at 5 p.m.

YOUTHFUL LEADER FOR INTERNET PUSH   
 TELCORDIA'S BIG CONTRACT  
 PLAYBOY ENTERPRISES DENIED AN INJUNCTION

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though only 28, Seth Goldstein is a veteran member of
New York's Internet industry, having started the Site Specific ad
agency in 1995. But recently, he has been the Inspector Gadget of
Silicon Alley.
</P>
<P>
   It was after selling Site Specific in 1997 to what is now
USWeb/CKS that Goldstein started a business called Root.net, which
aimed to help digital road warriors assemble their portable
arsenals. When that venture did not travel well, Goldstein became
an entrepreneur in residence with Flatiron Partners, the Internet
venture capital arm of Chase Manhattan. His mission has been to
figure out how to make money from the emergence of gadgets _ other
than PCs _ that may be connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is talking about how people will access the Internet
throughout the day, from the refrigerator in the morning telling
them the weather to their car dashboard giving directions and
playing music from MP3 files,'' he said. ``But it's not clear how
we're going to get there. And that uncertainty creates investment
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase has agreed to put up as much as $50 million to back gizmo
companies. And in seven months, Goldstein has managed to go through
half that money by investing in a handful.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Scout, a San Francisco company making a small
device that would sell for less than $100 and would receive
broadcasts of information of interest to ``urban youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Another is Vertical One, an Atlanta maker of software to bring
together balances from several banks; it would be used first on Web
sites and later on wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Appliance Network, a company that Goldstein created
with backing from Russell Pillar, chief executive of Virgin
Entertainment, is also in the group. It would offer online services
based on small devices used only for e-mail and Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking Media is another of the companies. It is a New York
concern that makes a Java software program called Sonata that is
used in online advertising and has applications in wireless
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Kozmo.com is also getting an infusion from Flatiron. The
increasingly popular New York service employs an army of bicycle
messengers and promises to deliver rental videocassettes and snacks
to wired, sugar-starved couch potatoes within an hour of an order
placed through its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein helped secure backing for Kozmo by using a computer to
summon a messenger to the Chase conference room where he was making
the pitch. ``A guy shows up with 15 pints of Ben &AMP; Jerry's within
half an hour,'' he recalled. ``That really greased the wheels.''

   Large Phone Contract From South Africa
</P>
<P>
   The newly renamed American company Telcordia Technologies Inc.
plans Monday to announce a big contract to help modernize Telkom
South Africa's antiquated telephone systems and bring phone service
to millions of South Africans for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The exact size of the deal was not revealed, but the contract
will be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Telcordia over
roughly three years, executives close to the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
   Until March, Telcordia was known as Bellcore, the former joint
research operation formed by the regional Bell companies after the
breakup of AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1984. Bellcore, which helped develop
standards and software for local phone networks, was acquired by
Science Applications International Inc. in 1997, after the Bell
companies increasingly went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   Telkom, South Africa's telephone monopoly, is 30 percent owned
by a consortium of the American telephone giant SBC Communications
Inc. and Telekom Malaysia. SBC executives are essentially running
the company under a mandate from the South African government to
expand and improve service.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem has been Telkom's outdated systems.
Telcordia will help revamp the company's networks and train
Telkom's technicians with an eye to expanding Telkom's reach from 5
million to 7 million lines by 2002. The companies plan to deploy
many of the new lines in rural areas that have not previously had
telephone service.

   Playboy Loses Round Over Search Engine Ads
</P>
<P>
   Giving a green light to a common but controversial Internet
advertising practice, a federal judge in California has refused a
request by Playboy Enterprises to stop the Web search services
Excite.com and Netscape.com from placing ads for pornography sites
with the search results for the words ``playboy'' or ``playmate.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining Playboy's request for a preliminary injunction, Judge
Alicemarie Stotler of U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, Calif.,
said Playboy was unlikely to succeed in a trial with its contention
that Excite Inc. had violated trademark laws.
</P>
<P>
   Marissa Gluck, an analyst with the research firm Jupiter
Communications, said the decision was good news for search
services, which she said derived 20 to 30 percent of their ad
revenue from the sale of banner ads linked to keywords.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit against Excite and America Online's Netscape
Communications unit, which licenses Excite's search technology,
Playboy had challenged this practice, known as banner ad keying,
saying that it could divert customers looking for Playboy's site
and also tarnish its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion on June 24, Stotler found that although Playboy
held trademarks for Playboy and Playmate, it did not have a
monopoly on the generic use of those words in English. For that
reason and others, the court said, Playboy had not shown that
Excite had made commercial use of Playboy's trademark, as would be
necessary to justify a trademark infringement lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Stotler also ruled that even if Excite had used Playboy's
trademarks, that use would not have been improper because Playboy
had offered no evidence that consumers would be confused about the
relationship between Playboy and a banner ad for a pornography
site.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Playboy said the company would appeal the decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike most people drawn to the siren song of Internet commerce,
Phil Worley started a Web site last spring with a modest goal: to
bring in some additional sales for his small-town hardware
business. No 50-page business plan. No venture capital. No initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   After three months of advertising Weber grills on the site _
which is hosted by The Hartford Courant (www.courant.com) _ at
prices lower than those of many competitors, he found that not even
his humble expectations were met. In other words, he has not sold a
thing online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen much payback,'' said Worley, owner of Worley
Ace Hardware in Canton, Conn., a town of about 8,000 that is 14
miles west of Hartford. ``But I feel like I need to be there, since
so many in my industry are. I'm keeping the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   For many people dipping their toes into e-commerce, the process
requires an element of faith _ whether for consumers concerned
about security, investors uncertain of their return or retailers
with no idea how consumers' online behavior will evolve. But for
local merchants who want to participate in the world's hottest
industry, faith is perhaps the biggest component of the business
model.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only that owners of small businesses often lack the
time, expertise and marketing budgets to compete with bigger
companies. It is not yet clear that people will look to local
merchants when they surf the Net for bargains. Meanwhile, online
city guides, which seek to aggregate local businesses for
advertising and transactions, are a fragmented bunch, with only
experimental ideas on how to approach local markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pretty picture for local merchants right now,''
said Lisa Allen, an e-commerce analyst with Forrester Research, an
Internet consulting firm. ``First of all, a lot of what's sold
online are commodities, and you don't need to buy a book or CD from
a local-yokel store,'' she said. ``But also, the national players
have the deep pockets to create sites with the best user experience
and market them. And the mom-and-pops don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allen said local merchants would attract $680 million in
Internet sales this year, or 9 percent of the total $7.8 billion
projected by Forrester. By 2003, Forrester expects local merchants
to increase those sales to $6 billion, but that number will account
for just 6 percent of the projected $108 billion in Web sales.
</P>
<P>
   In touting the potential of local e-commerce, some executives
point to the fact that people spend nearly 80 percent of their
money within a 20-mile radius of their homes. But ``interests, not
geography, will be important online,'' Ms. Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a wine aficionado, you won't necessarily go to the
local site,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, certain categories that show greater local
potential online _ including tickets, which Forrester anticipates
will reap 43 percent of local Web sales, or $2.6 billion, by 2003.
Such numbers bode well for Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch, which
hosts a network of city guides catering primarily to
entertainment-minded consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of the limits of local e-commerce, many
merchants use the Web for marketing rather than for completing
transactions with customers. Here businesses like employment
agencies, real estate agents and car dealerships are among the
biggest spenders, analysts and executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more things in the real estate industry will be done
online, so I'd expect our ad budget to grow online in the next
couple of years,'' said Stat Geer, regional manager for Chicago
Title Insurance Co., which advertises on the Chicago Digital City
site, operated by America Online in conjunction with The Chicago
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at least one study shows that local advertising online
is gaining momentum. According to a report last month by Kelsey
Group and Constat Inc., the Web has surpassed direct mail as an
advertising medium for local businesses, and is nearly equal to
local spending on newspaper advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that 17.2 percent of businesses involved in
local commerce use the Web for advertising and promotion, vs. 15.5
percent for direct mail, 18.7 percent for newspapers and 37.2
percent for Yellow Pages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Online city guides like Digital City and Citysearch, as well as
guides owned by newspapers (including The New York Times, which
publishes the New York Today site), have until recently attracted
advertisers using the same formula as any local media: provide
local news and entertainment information, and sell ads surrounding
that content.
</P>
<P>
   But with the e-commerce bandwagon picking up speed, more local
merchants are demanding not only advertising opportunities but
sophisticated Web sites that enable them to sell goods within the
city guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar is a lot higher now,'' said Charles Conn, chief
executive of Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch. ``When we used to sell
sites in our city guides to merchants, they wanted four or five
pages with pictures, maybe a menu if they were a restaurant. Now
they want streaming audio, the recipe of the day, and merchants
want the ability to transact.''
</P>
<P>
   Conn, who said merchants pay between $100 and $700 a month for a
site within a Citysearch guide, noted that consumers, too, will
increasingly expect local merchants to offer more transaction
capabilities. ``I think because people have been trained by tools
like Amazon and eBay for buying online, they'll look not only for
fresh information from sites like ours but transaction tools to
help them get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the great hope of merchants like Worley, of
Worley Ace Hardware, who pays $200 a month for his site. ``As with
so many people who are trying e-commerce, this is a large
experiment for me,'' he said. ``But I haven't really given this a
lot of attention, since I have so much going on running the
business. I suppose to do it right you have to do it big. And I
haven't done that yet.''

A PLANNED INTERNET YELLOW PAGES DRAWS FEDERAL SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aggravating an already charged political dispute
over its monopoly control of Internet addresses, Network Solutions
Inc. on Monday is set to introduce a new Yellow Pages-type
directory for the Internet, built around valuable data that the
Clinton administration insists belong to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The company is billing its new Dot-Com Directory as a ``find
engine'' that will make it easier for people to contact and get
information on businesses with Web sites. The directory taps data
that Network Solutions has compiled as the federal government's
exclusive registrar of more than 5 million addresses that end in
.com, .net and .org.
</P>
<P>
   Because Network Solutions has denied others the data for such
services, the introduction of the Dot-Com Directory is adding fuel
to its growing dispute with the government over both ownership of
the data base and the larger issue of the terms for opening its
main business, the registration of Internet addresses, to
full-scale competition.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it could also raise new antitrust complaints
against Network Solutions, which is already under investigation by
the Justice Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the Commerce Department's general counsel, Andrew
J. Pincus, sent a letter to Network Solutions requesting that it
open the data to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions declined comment over the weekend, saying that
senior management had not yet had a chance to review the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent the same day that Democratic leaders of the
House Commerce Committee's oversight panel sent a letter to
Secretary of Commerce William Daley calling the Dot-Com Directory
``a very troubling development by a company in a monopoly position
that already appears very reluctant to give up that position.''
This latest controversy follows the company's refusal to recognize
the authority of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, or ICANN, the oversight body picked by the Commerce
Department last year to oversee the introduction of global
competition to the business of registering Internet addresses,
known as domains.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the oversight committee held a hearing _ largely at
the urging and lobbying of Network Solutions _ to investigate
accusations that ICANN was overstepping its authority.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the hearing got under way, ICANN had defused
much of the criticism of its conduct by agreeing earlier in the
week to open its next board meeting to the public, as well as to
defer collection of a controversial $1-a-year tax on domain-name
registrations and to further limit its own authority.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Network Solutions found the tables turned at the
hearing, where it was peppered with questions about both its
resistance to working with ICANN and its stalemate with the
Commerce Department over rights to the data base, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   During questioning, Network Solutions' chief executive, Jim
Rutt, asserted that his company owned the intellectual-property
rights to the data base. The Commerce Department countered that the
information is public property.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter to Network Solutions on Friday, the Commerce
Department said it had no problem with the Dot-Com Directory as a
product but objected to its proprietary nature, which Pincus said
``appears effectively to insulate the Dot-Com Directory against any
real competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the Cooperative Agreement nor in existing law gives
NSI the right to restrict access to this information, which NSI
obtained in the course of providing registry and registrar services
_ on an exclusive basis _ under the authority of the United States
government,'' Pincus wrote. NSI refers to Network Solutions Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Network Solutions were to convince the Commerce
Department and Congress that the data base is its intellectual
property, it could add fuel to the Justice Department's
investigation of whether the company engaged in antitrust
violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly raises the stakes in its antitrust battles,''
said Hillard Sterling, who specializes in antitrust law in Chicago.
``Network Solutions would be well advised to minimize its allegedly
abusive activities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hillard added: ``It is possible that the DOJ will mandate the
sharing of this data base regardless of who technically owns the
information. Ownership isn't the only question. The underlying
inquiry involves the possibility of anticompetitive effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those pressing the Department of Justice to get involved
in the dispute is Joe Sims, the lawyer for ICANN, which is
currently overseeing a test in which five companies are being
allowed to compete against Network Solutions. Full-scale
competition cannot be introduced until the Commerce Department
reaches an agreement with the company on the terms for opening its
business _ or until the Commerce Department takes the drastic step
of turning the domain-registration business over to another company
or group.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers say the latter option would be a last resort,
as it could disrupt the Internet and force a split of its central
network.
</P>
<P>
   Still, from a business perspective, the company might have
little choice but to risk a legal battle with the government.
Although it has reported 11 straight quarters of record profits,
primarily on the registration of domain names, the $70 fee Network
Solutions currently charges is expected to go down once full-scale
competition is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, said Bill Whyman, an Internet analyst with the Legg Mason
investment firm in Washington, future profits from the
domain-registration business, will center on ancillary services
like the Dot-Com Directory. To get a leg up on the competition, he
said, the company must use its exclusive position while it still
has it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dot-Com Directory encourages customers to choose Network
Solutions over competitors by essentially giving them a free domain
registration. The company will charge $119 for a registration, but
that fee includes a listing in the directory. People who register
domain names with competitors will have to pay $119 just to be
listed in the directory.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Wolford, Network Solutions' senior vice president for
marketing, says the directory has about three times as many
listings as the most complete competing service.
</P>
<P>
   The Dot-Com Directory will also carry advertisements. At its
launching today, it will offer listings and information on 1.8
million businesses with some 3.5 million Web sites. The directory
is available at www.comdirectory.com.

IBM CHALLENGES EMC WITH NEW DATA-STORAGE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   International Business Machines Corp. is making a bid to regain
its leadership position in the high-performance end of the data
storage business with the introduction on Monday of a new
generation of big disk systems.
</P>
<P>
   The new product line, code-named Shark, arrives at a time when
the demand for data storage is growing at a torrid pace because of
the Internet, electronic commerce and data mining _ all of which
require fast access to vast amounts of information.
</P>
<P>
   And the new storage line, analysts say, represents IBM's effort
to challenge the current leader in high-end storage systems, EMC
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   EMC may not be a household name, but it is one of the most
striking success stories in high technology. By commercializing a
flexible high-performance storage technology known as RAID
(redundant array of independent disks), EMC grabbed the top spot in
the lucrative market for large external storage systems away from
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Today, big Internet companies like America Online and many major
corporations _ including those using IBM mainframe computers _
employ EMC systems as their main data storehouses. EMC, based in
Hopkinton, Mass., has grown to become a $4 billion-a-year company.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock has been the second-best performer among the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 companies during the 1990s, trailing only Dell
Computer. And its market capitalization exceeds that of such
corporate stalwarts as General Motors and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM Enterprise Storage Server line, according to analysts
who have been briefed in advance by the company, promises to be
stiff competition for EMC both in terms of price and performance.
``IBM's strategy is to try to come out with higher performance
systems at significantly lower prices,'' said John McArthur, an
analyst at International Data Corp., a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The proof, analysts cautioned, will be in the marketplace as the
big systems, which can cost $1 million or more, become generally
available in September. ``But this could be just what IBM needs to
be competitive with EMC,'' said James Porter, president of
Disk/Trend Inc., a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The new high-performance storage systems, IBM said, have
data-retrieval times that are far faster than rival products on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The company asserts that users can scale the systems from 420
gigabytes to 11 terabytes (enough to hold all the words in the
Library of Congress). And IBM says that its new line of storage
products can be used with a variety of computer systems: IBM 390
mainframes, Unix computers and machines running Microsoft's Windows
NT operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memo, James Vanderslice, senior vice president of
IBM's technology group, called the new product ``the biggest
storage announcement'' the company had made in the high-performance
end of the market since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo to Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman, and the rest
of IBM's top management, Vanderslice described the new storage line
as an Internet-related product that would allow Big Blue to deliver
``the advanced functions our customers need to manage the explosion
of data as they become e-businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Other computer makers have also recognized the importance of
high-performance data storage products _ and the business
opportunity in that market. Sun Microsystems Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. are entering the market, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies feel they have to, because storage is becoming
a central strategic product _ as important as the computer
itself,'' observed Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co. ``Data drives everything else in electronic commerce.''

   The $14-billion market for sophisticated external storage
systems increasingly spans a variety of computing platforms _
mainframes, machines running the Unix operating system and Windows
NT servers. ``This product hits the high-end of each of those
market segments,'' observed Ronald Kilpatrick, the general manager
of IBM's storage systems division.

BERNARD KAPLAN, VETERAN FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, DIES IN PARIS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Bernard D. Kaplan, a veteran foreign correspondent for
The Hearst Newspapers and one of the youngest reporters to cover
the Korean war, died Tuesday at the American Hospital in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kaplan, 71, died of complications from cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   As a roving Paris-based European correspondent for the past 42
years, Mr. Kaplan was regarded as an authoritative analyst who
explained complicated world affairs with clarity and wit, often
adding a nugget of history or religion or culture to make his
point.
</P>
<P>
   His sweeping repertoire of journalistic expertise earned him the
reputation as a ``renaissance reporter'' equally adept at writing
about diplomacy, global economics, politics, the British royal
family or an occasional wry commentary on the foibles of the
French.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kaplan's last article, written Nov. 30, employed his typical
historical sweep to dissect the intricate relationship between
Germany and Russia over the centuries. His point: Germany's current
economic ties with Russia explain the Berlin government's
solicitous overtures to the faltering administration of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Mr. Kaplan personified the urbane foreign
correspondent who moved with ease through the diplomatic corridors
of Europe. He was a personal acquaintance of many of the world
leaders he covered and had an enormous reservoir of background
information about them and the issues they were involved with. He
also was an impeccable dresser who knew which Parisian restaurants
and wines were in vogue at any particular time.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kaplan was active in the Anglo-American Press Association in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Frank A. Bennack, Jr., president and chief
executive officer of The Hearst Corporation, issued a statement
describing Mr. Kaplan as a ``warm and valued colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie Kaplan's service to the Hearst organization, which goes
back to his days with INS during the Korean War, was known by all
of us to be of the highest and most professional caliber,'' Bennack
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work on behalf of the Hearst Newspapers since 1975
resulted in reports which were always insightful and often unique.
Additionally, his contributions to the columns of William Randolph
Hearst, Jr., our late editor-in-chief, were always meaningful.
Bernie will be missed by all of us both professionally and
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kaplan began his career as one of the youngest American
correspondents covering the Korean War, working for the
International News Service, a wire service then owned by the Hearst
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Mr. Kaplan was drafted and served two years in
the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, he joined the North American Newspaper Alliance as a
correspondent based in Paris, where he made his home until his
death. He also worked for the Montreal Star, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation and NBC in Paris before joining the Hearst
Newspapers in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He won the Canadian Newspaper Publishers Award for best foreign
coverage in 1965 for a series on the European Common Market.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Mr. Kaplan graduated from Washington
&AMP; Lee University in Lexington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife of 48 years, Antonia Kaplan; their
two children, Charles and Juliette, both of Paris; two
grandchildren; his brother, Leonard, of Palm Beach, Fla., and a
sister, Doris Chieffetz, of Huntington, L.I.

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As the labor movement sets its sights on the booming
high-technology world, employees like Matt Shea, a 24-year-old
software developer, seem ripe for the picking. He often clocks
70-hour weeks, his managers sometimes push him to work past
midnight, and he never receives overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Shea whether he wants a union at his workplace, a
thriving Internet start-up called Go2Net, and his response is a
puzzled expression that says ``Does Not Compute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as me personally, and for everyone else here, unions
have never come up,'' said Shea, who said he loved his job,
notwithstanding the sweatshop hours. ``Everything I want is offered
to me here.''
</P>
<P>
   The American labor movement has belatedly recognized that if it
is to reverse the decades-long slide in the percentage of workers
belonging to unions, it must make some headway in high technology,
the economy's fastest-growing sector. To increase their numbers and
their influence in politics and at the bargaining table, unions
cannot afford to be shut out of the glamorous, powerful high-tech
industry, which accounts for an ever-larger share of the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading technology workers to join unions will not be easy,
though, because of all that is lavished upon people like Shea. His
job gives him valuable stock options, flexible hours, an excellent
medical plan, a sense of family and, perhaps most important, the
thrill of building something.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders acknowledge that they face an uphill battle _ only
a small fraction of the nation's 2 million computer and software
developers, programmers and engineers belongs to labor unions. But
organizers are far from packing their bags in Seattle or Silicon
Valley. In fact, they are convinced that many high-technology
employees will ultimately warm to labor's message that workers need
a collective voice to stand up to management.
</P>
<P>
   In a public relations coup this spring, union organizers
trumpeted one of their first successes in high technology when 16
temporary workers at Microsoft became the first group of software
workers in a single workplace to call for union representation.
Their action reflects a little-understood aspect of high-tech
America: While most high-technology workers are contented haves,
there are also many discontented have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Most have-nots come from the sea of long-term temps who work at
Microsoft and other high-tech companies, and they often complain of
being second-class citizens who receive bare-bones benefits and
have no job security or stock options. Microsoft employs 20,500
regular workers domestically and 6,000 temps, who often call
themselves permatemps because they work anywhere from six months to
three years at the company, testing software, writing manuals,
designing Web pages and developing CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts estimate that at many companies _ including
Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Intel _ more than 10 percent
of the workers are temps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions are not the same as where unions have had a lot
of success,'' said Jonathan Rosenblum, organizing director for the
King County Labor Council in Seattle, ``but that doesn't mean there
aren't a lot of substantive issues that concern high-tech workers
and make them feel they want to have a voice in their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as high technology has had vast ripple effects on the way
Americans live, it is forcing changes in the American labor
movement. Labor's traditional focus has been getting a majority of
employees at a work site _ usually full-time workers tied for years
to a single employer _ to vote for a union then negotiating a
contract for them.
</P>
<P>
   But unions are finding that this model may be as obsolete in
high-tech America as a 286 Intel chip, because workers jump among
companies like honeybees from flower to flower.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor organizers acknowledge that they may never get a
majority of workers at start-ups or at giants like Intel to vote in
a union. So they are trying to devise new ways to represent
high-technology workers.
</P>
<P>
   An innovative example came in February when, seeking to improve
benefits for high-tech temps, the AFL-CIO office in Silicon Valley
set up an employment agency offering far better benefits than other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we go to work has changed,'' said Amy Dean, director
of the AFL-CIO's Silicon Valley office. ``So we, the labor
movement, have to create a response that recognizes that the world
has changed, while still embracing the values, like equity and
giving workers a voice, that labor has always stood for.''
</P>
<P>
   For Shea, the 24-year-old software engineer, unions are not so
much undesirable as irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   At Go2Net, he has no out-of-pocket costs for his health or
dental plan. He is happy with his flexible hours and two weeks of
vacation a year. And he loves working at a start-up where he has a
strong sense of making a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal has always been to develop software that lots of
people use,'' he said. ``Here you can see 10,000 people using your
software every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do his 70-hour weeks make him resent management.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as what gets me up in the morning or what makes me stay
up so late, that's a pride issue,'' said Shea, who received a
bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of
California at San Diego. ``Last night, I was up till 4 a.m. testing
a new home page.''
</P>
<P>
   The salary of a software wunderkind like Shea usually ranges
from $50,000 to $100,000 a year, often with stock options that
double or triple that amount.
</P>
<P>
   High-technology executives say that one overarching factor works
against labor's success: the shortage of skilled software workers.
Because demand far outstrips supply, companies often feel they must
offer lavish salaries and stock options to recruit and retain
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is so damn competitive in seeking the best
talent that if you don't give your employees what they want, you'll
lose them in a second,'' said Ethan Caldwell, general counsel of
Go2Net, which is known for its Metacrawler search engine and a
financial discussion Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At many start-ups, the workplace culture is so worker-friendly
that it leaves union organizers out in the cold. High-technology
start-ups emphasize hiring entrepreneurial self-starters, the type
of employee least likely to turn to unions for help.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies also strive to create a sense of family and
fun. At many companies, there are free sodas, basketball courts and
latte bars. One company took all its workers on a free ski trip
when it met a crucial sales goal.
</P>
<P>
   And last _ but certainly not least _ are stock options, a
strategy that strengthens loyalty to management and inspires
workers to want to build the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of workers, there's a little bit of a hero's
journey, that I can be part of building this thing into a $10
billion company,'' said Evan Kaplan, chief executive of Aventail, a
start-up in Seattle, which has 100 workers and provides security
software for computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to build a work environment that's fun and
challenging, and you try to deal with benefits in a way that brings
them up to a level that you know is good, which is one of the
reasons you don't see a tendency toward unionization,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason unions are not catching fire with high-technology
workers is that so many are in their 20s and 30s and grew up when
labor's visibility and clout were on the wane. Union anthems like
``Solidarity Forever'' and ``Joe Hill'' are as unfamiliar to them
as 14th-century madrigals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think about unions, because they were never part of my
life,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Many high-tech workers say that if they disliked their jobs, it
would make more sense to hop to another employer than to undertake
a unionization drive that could cause a six-month war with
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is so hot now that if you have the training and job
experience, you can walk down the street to the next start-up or to
Microsoft and get a job,'' said Debra Joyce, the 29-year-old
manager of information systems at Aventail. ``So if you're unhappy,
you don't necessarily need union protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor leaders say that the industry's workers will warm to
unions when the high-tech boom crests _ when high-tech stocks fall,
stock options tumble in value and unemployment rises in the
industry, making it harder for unhappy workers to simply jump to
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   As five Microsoft temps met with two union organizers at Azteca,
a restaurant two minutes from the Microsoft campus, the
conversation ranged from mild to militant. Over beer and tortilla
chips, they talked of staging a sit-in at a temp agency and of
organizing a T-shirt day when dozens of supporters would wear
pro-union shirts to Microsoft's main cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Turner, a 39-year-old accountant turned software temp who
has been at Microsoft since August, explained before the meeting
that a mountain of grievances had pushed him and the 15 other
workers to back unionization. Unlike regular workers, the temps
receive no Microsoft stock options, no pay on sick days and an
inferior health plan. Many said they were misclassified into jobs
that paid less than they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like what we do, we like our Microsoft managers and we like
each other,'' said Turner, who complained that he has to pay $3,300
of the nearly $60,000 he earns each year toward health insurance
premiums. ``If we didn't, we wouldn't be fighting to improve a job
we really like. But I believe that without a union we have no shot.
They'll just blow us off.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16 workers, part of an 18-person team creating a new
financial software product, want to be represented by the
Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, known as Washtech, a
fledgling union with four organizers and a $175,000 annual budget
paid for by the Communications Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is renowned for churning out 30-year-old
multimillionaires, but it is also churning out lots of disgruntled
temps, and that is fueling the unionization push.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because you're working side by side with
other people who are getting so much more for doing substantially
the same thing,'' said David Larsen, a $15-an-hour temp who has
worked as a Microsoft software tester for 18 months. ``The company
softball field says you can't use it. They give regular employees
stock options and discounts on Microsoft products, and all we get
is an e-mail from our temp agency saying there's a drawing for a
free snowboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives say it makes sense to use thousands of
temporary workers because the company has so many projects _ like
new software development _ that last six months. While Microsoft's
critics insist that the company uses temps to skimp on benefits and
severance payments, company executives say using temps is fairer to
the workers _ they do not come in thinking they have permanent
jobs, only to be laid off once their projects end.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also quick to note that many workers prefer temping
to permanent employment because it gives them greater freedom to
travel or work on the side and because they can earn lots of
overtime pay _ unlike regular Microsoft workers, who are considered
salaried professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with being a contractor,'' said Emmet Skaar, a
32-year-old software tester. ``I'm happy being in charge of my own
destiny, and I'm very pleased with the compensation package. If
these people aren't happy as contractors, they should go get
themselves hired as permanent employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Discontent among temps has resulted in one lawsuit in which a
federal appeals court has found for the plaintiffs. The court ruled
that thousands of workers hired by Microsoft through employment
agencies were regular employees rather than temps and should
qualify for certain Microsoft benefits, including its discount
stock purchase plan.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are now thrashing out how many tens of millions of
dollars Microsoft owes these so-called temps. And Microsoft has
adopted a new rule requiring all temps to take a 31-day break in
their work at least once a year to ensure that they can no longer
be viewed as regular workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is engaged in a pretense about people working for
Microsoft not being its employees,'' said Stephen Strong, one of
the plaintiffs' lawyers. ``If Microsoft provided a reasonable level
of benefits to all employees, if Microsoft grew up and acted like
the major employer it is and not a small business, no one would be
thinking about a union.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impassioned words from Microsoft's pro-union temps,
they face a decided challenge. For one thing, Microsoft insists
that their real employer is not Microsoft but their employment
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizing is an issue between an employee and the employer,
and in this case the employers are the contingent staffing
companies,'' said Dan Leach, a Microsoft spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Union organizers fear that if the 16 temps petition for a
unionization election, there will be years of litigation to
determine who is the employer and whether the appropriate
bargaining unit is their 18-worker software group, the 6,000 temps
at Microsoft or a 3,000-worker employment agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to organize workers in this
co-employer setting,'' said Michael Blain, Washtech's co-founder.
``Existing labor law is totally inadequate to address issues of the
new economy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seeing the difficulties in getting most workers at a high-tech
company to vote to unionize, labor leaders are looking to
nontraditional ways to build a union. Kirk Adams, the AFL-CIO's
organizing director, said unions could attract high-tech workers by
providing two important benefits: affordable training and mobility
of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry where it is vital to know the latest
software-writing languages to advance to higher-paying positions,
many temp workers complain about paying for-profit schools $600 for
a 10-hour course. (Temps often cannot take the free in-house
courses that companies offer.) So Washtech provides such courses
for $75 to people who join the new union by agreeing to pay one
hour's wages each month; 175 have joined so far, and more than
1,000 others have asked to be on the union's electronic mailing
list.
</P>
<P>
   Some union leaders talk of creating a high-technology hiring
hall, similar to ones in construction, in which companies would
contribute to a joint pension and health plan so workers who hop
between companies would not lose their pension credits or health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cohen, the organizing director for Washtech's parent, the
Communications Workers of America, said labor might settle early on
for the rudimentary role of creating a collective voice for
high-tech workers. Cohen said such a union, instead of negotiating
contracts, would exchange information among members and sometimes
speak for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than feel they're just a little boat bobbing in the
water,'' he said, ``people could feel they're part of a larger
organization that shares their values.''
</P>
<P>
   But all these strategies could prove futile because so many
high-tech workers view unions as unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job,'' said Paul Primrose, a customer service worker
at Amazon.com. ``Some occupations do need unions, but not here.
It's because things change so rapidly that you need to change
quickly, and unions could get in the way.''

AN ENTREPRENEURIAL EXCEPTION HARNESSES THE INTERNET IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>

 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Masayoshi Son seems an unlikely deal maker in the bubbly
and free-spirited world of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Short, boyish-looking and soft-spoken, Son _ while in Japan _
wears the Japanese business uniform of a white shirt and an
immaculately pressed black suit. In public, he sometimes stands
stiffly and smiles only slightly. He bows often to emphasize his
humility.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he lives in Tokyo, the risk-averse capital of the
world, where the Internet is still a foreign concept to many.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is such a thing as an Internet financial and media
empire, Son's company, Softbank, may be it. Son, 41, and Softbank
are already among the most powerful financial forces in cyberspace,
controlling key stakes in 100 Internet information providers in the
United States and 20 such companies in Japan. The stakes in
publicly held companies, worth $15 billion to $20 billion, are
sprinkled widely. Softbank now owns 28 percent of Yahoo. And it has
important stakes in Geocities, E-Loans, E-Trade, USWeb Message
Media, and TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   And Softbank is intensifying its focus on the Internet with new
deals all the time. Last Tuesday, for example, it agreed to pay $20
million for a 40 percent stake in Webhire, an online recruiting
company. And Softbank may sell much of its 70 percent stake in
Ziff-Davis, the publisher of such magazines as PC Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a global player in the Internet, they are the
player,'' said Jarett F. Wait, chief operating officer in Asia for
Lehman Brothers, which recently released a 195-page report on the
company. ``There's nobody else that comes close.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Son is Japan's leading entrepreneur, the oddity, and
perhaps the reason, is that he is not ethnically Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese-Korean, he grew up poor in southern Japan, closed off
from normal avenues in Japan's corporate world because of
discrimination against Koreans. Denied a chance to succeed at a
leading company, he started Softbank and has become one of Japan's
richest men.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank's aim is to become a global Internet ``zaibatsu,'' a
Japanese-style empire with investments in many linked companies.
Softbank has begun Internet ventures through Yahoo in Germany,
France and Britain; it has investment alliances with Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. in Europe, and a joint venture in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next 10 years, we do nothing but Internet,'' Son said,
speaking in English during an interview in his spacious office.
``Because that's where the whole society is going to have a big
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after building the foundations of his Internet kingdom in
the United States, Son is turning back to Japan _ one of the least
entrepreneurial societies. Last month, he and Frank G. Zarb,
chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
announced a plan to form a new trading exchange, a Japanese version
of Nasdaq, that could become a center for electronic brokerage
activity, electronic research and entrepreneurial ventures in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Son will feed that entrepreneurial spirit with venture-capital
funds that aim to pour $85 million into building Japanese start-ups
and grooming hundreds of Softbank wannabes. On June 29, Son held a
reception for 1,400 budding entrepreneurs. He spent the morning of
July 5 with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other government
officials to offer some ideas for reviving Japan's economy. The
entry of Son, an entrepreneur from the Korean minority, into the
prime minister's residence underscores the changing times in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he faces some enormous challenges. So far he has been a kind
of venture capitalist, backing Internet enterprises early and
riding on their success. But he does not manage or plan them. And
the soaring value of Internet stocks has perhaps exaggerated his
ability to pick individual winners.
</P>
<P>
   Son's appetite for expansion has often outstripped his financial
ability. Even now, he often taps the bond markets, and he is
carrying about three times as much debt as equity.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a shake-out in the Internet, or if Internet stocks
prove to be a bubble that pops, then Softbank may falter. Moreover,
as Son ventures into relatively new territory _ like the stock
exchange _ he is taking risks in areas in which he has no proved
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one seems eager to bet against him. And almost no one
is better than he is at adjusting to a new situation.
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes comes across as a chameleon. He can backslap and
talk in colloquial English with American investment bankers and
then discuss the details of new computer chips with the techies. He
can also turn somber and bow and speak in polite Japanese to melt
into a Japanese business crowd.
</P>
<P>
   This knack comes from his personal background, which has haunted
and helped him since his days growing up in a small town on the
southern Japanese island of Kyushu. Son's grandparents came to
Japan from Korea, where his family had lived for 21 generations
after migrating from China.
</P>
<P>
   His father and other Koreans illegally built their houses on
land owned by Japan National Railways, which led to a long-running
conflict with the authorities. It was on that land that Son's
father raised pigs and chickens and illicitly made sake. The home
brew was apparently lucrative, for he became the first person in
town to buy a car.
</P>
<P>
   When Son's family moved out of its Korean neighborhood so he
could attend a better school, to try to melt into society the
family took a Japanese last name, Yasumoto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a good student, but in those days I had a darkness in my
mind all the time,'' Son wrote in an essay in 1992. ``It was
because of my nationality. When I was with friends, I was very
happy. When I came back home alone, I had the feeling that I was
hiding something from my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   He took on his real Korean-Chinese name, Son, when he went to
the United States at 16 to attend high school and then on to the
University of California at Berkeley. It was his American
experience, he says, that laid the groundwork for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had stayed all the time in Japan,'' Son said, ``I
probably would have become much more conservative, just as other
Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   One important element in the effort to change attitudes of young
people will be to expand opportunities for them to finance their
companies and to reward them with stock options _ and that is where
the new stock exchange comes in. In February, Son met John L.
Hilley, an aide to Zarb for the first time through a mutual friend.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner at a French restaurant at the Royal Park Hotel,
close to Softbank's offices, Hilley began pouring out his
frustrations over trying to break into the Japanese market. He had
been in meetings his whole trip and had received very little
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Maybe we can help, maybe you went to the wrong
place,''' Son recalled. He told Hilley, ``You need someone who has
the entrepreneurial spirit to make this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Son and Zarb then began talking about setting up a new exchange,
an idea made possible by recent changes in the securities
regulations under Japan's financial liberalization. The idea also
dovetailed with Son's ambition to help shape electronic brokerage
and the Internet in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this proposal fails and Son suffers a blow to his
reputation, he still has his bet on the Internet. He says that as
Internet technology evolves, the potential for returns from the
information that travels on the network will be far greater than
anything realized so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my fortune-telling, `` he said. ``I'm betting on
that.''

ATTACKS BY `CRACKERS' ON PROGRAMS SHIPPED WITH UNIX REPORTED UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A leading computer security group is reporting a
significant rise in potentially dangerous attacks that exploit
security holes in programs shipped with the Unix operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Unix is the most common operating system for servers, the
powerful computers that control the flow of data over large
networks, including the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a good number of reports related to thousands of
different machines on scores of different sites,'' said Shawn
Hernan, a member of the Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT,
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ``This is not like the
Melissa virus, but it's a fairly significant event in Internet
security.'' The Melissa program infected about 19 percent of the
nation's large corporations in March.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of the damage might not yet be evident _ and may
not be for some time _ because the attacks, when successful, give
those cracking into a network what is known as ``root access,''
basically complete control over the server. This enables the
crackers, as such intruders are known, not only to wreak immediate
havoc with networks but to plant small, hard-to-trace programs that
can be set off at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Hernan said a wide range of organizations, from small companies
to universities and large corporations, reported being attacked
last week. But, citing CERT policy, he declined to name specific
companies or organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Todd, a network engineer for an Internet security company,
said a client he would describe only as a ``large state or federal
agency'' had been attacked multiple times both from within the
United States and abroad. He said he had heard that at least half a
dozen other government agencies had also been hit.
</P>
<P>
   While the attacks did some mischief, like altering Web pages,
Todd said he had not seen any serious damage so far.
</P>
<P>
   Todd's company, Advanced Research Corp. in Vienna, Va., was
apparently the first to report the attacks in a posting on Bugtraq,
an Internet security mailing list. Later, explicit instructions for
exploiting the newest of the security holes were also posted to
Bugtraq; Todd said his company was not responsible for that
posting.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Entertainment Group in Seattle may also have been hit,
according to messages posted on security discussion groups on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks primarily exploit software that manages an
appointment calendar program that is shipped with Unix operating
systems from makers of powerful servers, including Sun Microsystems
Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Sun has already released a patch for
the problem, and Hewlett-Packard plans to do so soon, according to
CERT.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the calendar program, the crackers are also
exploiting two previously identified Unix bugs. They appear to be
using an automated software script that tries to exploit each
security hole in turn, Hernan said. He said he based that
conclusion on having found similar entries in the log files that
servers keep of each transaction on a network and on seeing
identical pernicious files on the attacked computers.
</P>
<P>
   Though patches for the previously identified bugs have been
available for some time, many system administrators have not yet
applied them.
</P>
<P>
   ``System administrators don't apply patches as quickly as we'd
like,'' Hernan said. ``They have their own priorities, and
sometimes they'll go months without fixing'' the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Patching the security holes after an attack cannot repair any
damage already done. Of special concern with these attacks is that
it is very difficult to determine what has been done since these
bugs give the intruder complete control over the affected machine,
Hernan said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond immediate damage, the crackers can install so-called
Trojan horse programs that obscure their activity and can set off
malignant processes at a later date. The safest response to such an
attack is to erase the hard drive, reinstall the operating system
and software and then restore the data from backups that predate
the attack _ a very time consuming process.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar bug involves what is known as a ``buffer overflow''
vulnerability, one of the most common types of software security
holes. The attacker pretends to make an entry in the calendar, but
the ``entry'' is really a carefully designed chunk of information
that is too large to fit the storage space the program allots for
the entry. The overflow spilling out into the computer's main
memory consists of software code that can do any number of things
but usually grants the cracker root access.
</P>
<P>
   A university system administrator who asked not to be identified
said his network had been attacked, but he said there had been
little damage since this particular cracker's clumsy execution
caught the attention of system personnel. He said he suspected that
the intruder might have been using an attack recipe obtained from
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large cracker community out there, and they talk to
each other,'' he said. ``These people waste an enormous amount of
resources.''

Non-Intel chip a subtle sign corners might have been cut 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a good reason _ as far as I'm concerned _ to
think twice about buying a computer with a non-Intel processor
chip.
</P>
<P>
   That reason has very little to do with whether the non-Intel
chip works as well or as fast as the Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   When I started messing with PCs, the choice was simple. You got
the chip that was available from Intel. Now there are chips from
AMD, Cyrix and others. If you read computer magazines, you'll find
almost monthly reviews of some of these non-Intel chips and the
results of so-called benchmark tests where the chip is tested for
speed against chips from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the non-Intel chips win in these benchmark tests,
sometimes Intel wins. In almost every case, the margin of victory
is so slim that you'd never notice the speed increase in real-life
computing.
</P>
<P>
   So speed, or lack of it, isn't a good reason to care about the
brand of the processor chip. The best reason to care about the
non-Intel chips is price. The usual rule of thumb is that the chip
(not the computer made using the chip) is usually about 20 percent
less expensive than an Intel chip of the same speed.
</P>
<P>
   So you are most likely to find these chips in computers designed
to compete based on price. If you thumb through a computer magazine
or walk the aisles of a computer store, you'll soon notice that
these chips are mostly found in low-cost machines.
</P>
<P>
   So far I've dealt with the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But if we were at a party together and you asked me if you
should consider one of these PCs with a non-Intel chip, I'd say get
the real thing. I'd tell you first that, if I sat down at the
computer without knowing whether it had an Intel chip, it would be
unlikely that I could tell the difference. Most of your programs
would run fine on either machine and occasionally screw up on
either machine. Both machines would be fast and work OK.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what scares me about non-Intel chips. Since they are
mostly found in machines that are designed to sell at the lowest
possible price (and that's really the only reason a manufacturer
would use a non-Intel chip, since the Intel name is a well-known
brand that helps sell computers), I worry that the desire to sell
the lowest-price computer means compromises elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty easy, even for an amateur, to know what kind of
processor chip is inside the computer. But, when it comes to the
type and quality of components like disk drives, sound cards, video
cards, RAM (the memory chips) and, obviously, resistors and
capacitors ... most people don't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense tells me that if I am trying to make a computer
that I can sell at a price below the competition, I'm going to look
for other ways besides the processor chip to lower my costs.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that I am highly ethical and I do my best to get stuff
that works OK (and not every company is that ethical). I'll still
have to make some compromises. After all, the biggest and best
companies can get parts as cheap or cheaper than I can. So the only
way to save money is to go down a grade in quality.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, that won't keep the low-cost computer from
starting up fine when you hit the switch. But there truly is a
reason that some components cost more than others. With
electronics, that reason often is that the quality control is
higher and the long-term failure rate somewhat lower.
</P>
<P>
   So, and remember this is my opinion, think of the non-Intel chip
as a tiny warning flag that says: We built this computer using
parts from the lowest-priced vendor.

Frankie and Louie talk on screen saver 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Until recently, I never had much use for fancy screen
savers. I always picked the plain one from the selection Microsoft
offers with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But, acting upon the advice of someone on a mailing list to
which I subscribe, I found satisfaction at a Web site,
www.screensavershot.com.
</P>
<P>
   This is a vast repository of screen savers of every kind. Under
the Animals section, in the 24th selection, is the Frank and Louie
screen saver. Frank _ more properly Frankie, I think _ and Louie
are, of course, the Budweiser lizards. The screen saver features
all the dialogue from the commercials: ``Our audition was
flawless,'' ``This is the happiest day of my life, Frankie,'' etc.
</P>
<P>
   The lizards' lips don't sync too well with the audio, but what
the heck. Dragonflies flitter by, and occasionally one of the boys
nails one and gulps it down. I had it installed for a long time
before I realized that their turret-like eyes move to follow the
cursor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since it's largely static, this isn't a really
efficient screen saver, so after awhile, it goes to black. The
audio continues.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the dialogues of Louie and Frankie (''What have
you done?'') drive my wife crazy. Fortunately for our connubial
bliss, there are on-screen switches to turn off the audio, and even
eliminate the arrival of dragonflies, presumably for those
squeamish about lizards gobbling insects.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, even if you aren't enthralled by querulous lizards,
you will surely find something to delight you at this site. There
are hundreds of screen savers, all of them free for the download.
Everything from cars, trains and planes to cartoons and Playboy
centerfolds.
</P>
<P>
   EASY WAY TO TRANSFER FILES
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it was about six weeks ago that I issued an appeal for
help regarding a very nice lady who wanted to get a new computer
but couldn't figure out how to get her word processor files off her
old one. The appeal drew several hundred responses, every one of
them useless because I stupidly provided erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   I said the lady had her files on an old 286. No such luck. I
meant to say she had them on an old IBM XT. My apologies to all the
folks who took the time to offer solutions, and the many among them
who even offered their own equipment to accomplish the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   No thanks to the ones who wondered why I was so stupid that I
couldn't figure it out for myself.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I got a nice note from the lady. She has her new computer
now. All her files are on it, thanks to the nice young man who
helped her with it. He told me he sent it to a data recovery firm.
</P>
<P>
   Let this be a lesson to those of you _ and there are a lot of
you _ who use your computers for nothing but writing. A computer
can be utterly obsolete and still perform quite satisfactorily for
word processing. But don't let technology leave your storage system
in obsolesence. Like my nice lady, you'll have a lot of trouble, at
best, getting them transferred to a new computer if your old one
dies, or even sharing files with somebody who has a newer machine.

Well-connected: Home networking concept booming 
By Gerry Yandel  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A network computer crash is never a pretty thing.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on Richard Bodor's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``My users cry, kick and hold their breath when the network is
down,'' he says. ``They say, `I don't like Daddy. He's not getting
a Father's Day present.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bodor has been networking the computers in his Alpharetta home
for seven years. That network gets extensive use by the five
computer-adept Bodors. Wife Kim uses it for real estate searches
and tracking stocks; Denise, 13, uses America Online Instant
Messenger to keep up with friends; Richard, 11, is the gamer; and
Amy, 8, is into ``activityware'' like ``Mr. Potatohead'' and
``Spiderman Animator.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the network is up and running smoothly, things can
still be, well, tricky on the Bodor network.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son convinced me to set up a `Quake' (a game that can be
played over a network) server for the network, then ran crying to
his mother an hour later screaming, `Daddy is trying to blow me
up,''' says Bodor. ``He expected me to just stand there and let him
shoot me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creepy.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a fine line between dad and sysop.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his job at Rockwell Automation outside Atlanta, where
Bodor is up to his elbows in hardware, he has been able to indulge
in what he calls a hobby. His five-machine home network consists of
some 448 megabytes of RAM and 18 gigabytes of hard drive space
running on Pentiums of all flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Bodor says that when he connected his home network to the
Internet, his kids' interest in computers increased tenfold. Since
then, the network has become an integral part of the Bodors' home
life.
</P>
<P>
   While he admits it might appear odd to walk into his house and
find the whole family logged in at machines in different rooms,
Bodor says the family still does things offline together, like go
to movies. And the home network has opened a new avenue of family
communication, especially between father and adolescent daughter:
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect I could bring up things in an e-mail, like about her
friends or about boys, that I could never say face to face,'' he
says. ``When she tells me she's getting married, it'll be in an
e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Bodors' situation may be unique in that their network
has been around since 1992, they are an example of a market that
has the computer industry salivating. The home networking boom,
which began to build industry buzz only last year, is about to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is just developing and starting to take off,''
said Thomas L. Funk, manager of strategic marketing for Compaq, but
speaking on behalf of the HomePNA. The Home Phoneline Networking
Association is a consortium of industry heavyweights formed last
summer to help develop standards for the technology allowing people
to use their existing telephone lines as a home network
infrastructure. Besides Compaq, other founding companies include
Microsoft, 3Com, Intel, AT&AMP;T, Lucent, AMD and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, generally there are about 15 to 20 million homes in
the United States that have multiple PCs,'' Funk said. ``Any home
that has multiple devices or is considering buying another computer
is a candidate (for home networking).''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with shrinking margins from PC sales, the computer
manufacturers see a way to recoup some of those losses: marketing
home networks so people will buy more than one computer. In fact,
computer companies large and small will gather in San Francisco
this week for Homenet '99, a two-day affair addressing this
emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a home network becomes more enticing as telecoms,
cable companies and Internet service providers merge and morph into
one-stop shops providing phone service, TV signals and Internet
access through a single big, fat data pipe into your home.
</P>
<P>
   The result, says Mike Wolf, networking industry analyst for the
high-tech market research firm Cahner's In-Stat Group, is that the
2 million home networks in the United States today will explode
into 13.8 million networked households by 2003, with end-use
revenues projected to be $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf and Funk point to plummeting PC prices and access to
high-speed broadband technology as the main forces helping to drive
this new trend. Besides the wholehearted endorsement of the
computer industry, there are other factors at play as well _ like
the way people have so readily adapted to high technology and the
Internet and its staggering growth and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands what the Net is, and the concept of a
network isn't as foreign as it used to be,'' says Wolf.
``Manufacturers have masked the difficulty of the technology.
They've softened and candy-coated it with install wizards and
things like that to make it easier, so the end user won't have to
really understand how a TCP stack works.''
</P>
<P>
   ven though he could probably offer a credible definition of a
TCP stack, Bob Vogel, who manages a 40-person network engineering
department for the satellite company Panamsat Corp., never really
had to deal with it. Even when he used software called Wingate, one
of several server software packages tailored to home networking, to
set up the three-machine Local Area Network running off a cable
modem in his Rockdale County home. The only thing required on his
end was for Vogel to install Wingate on the machine he designated
as a server and to copy a small program onto each of his other
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program sets itself up,'' he said. One thing Vogel plans
to change, though, is which machine he uses as the server. It's
currently on the machine used by his 15-year-old son, Eric, who is
deeply into network gaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he reboots, the whole network freezes,'' Vogel says.
``He's one of these kids who actually blows out his machine and
reloads Windows every now and then. He's always downloading stuff
from the Internet to try out and rebooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a home network is not much more difficult than
installing Wingate. The network doesn't need to be anything more
than some machines using Windows 95 or better and each equipped
with a network interface card and some cable connecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Because most people want to use a home network to share a single
Internet connection _ which can be done easily whether you use a
cable modem, ADSL or even a 56k dial-up modem _ some server
software is needed. (It acts as a traffic cop, making sure that the
different requests from each user's machine for access to the Net
don't collide and crash the whole shooting match.)
</P>
<P>
   If there will be more than two machines on the network, hardware
like a hub or router acts as a distribution point to the computers
on the LAN.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most difficult aspect of installing their networks
for Vogel and Bodor was running the cable. They each bought Cat5
cable, which consists of four twisted pairs of wire, as opposed to
standard telephone wire, which is two twisted pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with not much more than a drill, Vogel and Bodor ran wire
through closets, across the basement, around baseboards and out of
ceilings when they retrofitted their homes for a network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not elegant,'' said Vogel. ``What I did was go from the
bottom floor down to the basement, and the builder had a PVC pipe
with a flue that went from the basement to the attic. If that
wasn't there, I don't know what I would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men said they wanted Cat5's capabilities to transmit data
at the blazingly fast speed of 100 megabytes per second. While that
may sound like the be-all and end-all in data speed, Cat6 cable _
which boasts a transmit rate of 250mbps _ is already on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel and Bodor recommend buying network hardware from the Web
for the best prices and the most current versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't skimp on the NICs (network cards) and hubs,'' says
Vogel, who also suggests online auctions as a source of good
hardware. Vogel paid $30 apiece for some ``slightly used''
name-brand 100BaseT network interface cards that retail for about
$100 directly from the manufacturer's resellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great deals, and they worked fine. (There's) no software or
documentation, but you can get the latest drivers and manuals
directly from the 3Com Web site,'' he said. ``Name-brand LAN
hardware is so simple. There is little risk of DOAs (equipment that
doesn't work when it arrives), so Web buying is the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants to go around the house drilling holes in the
floor. But, like any good computer technology story, there are
several ways to go when setting up a home network ... none of which
is compatible with any of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Funk's consortium would call Vogel's network ``structured
wiring.'' The HomePNA advocates technology using already existing
phone lines, making home network set-up that much easier. Other
options currently available include RF (radio frequency) networks
and ``powerline'' networks, which use existing electrical lines as
a network infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Although structured wiring-type networks are predominant today
among the 2 million homes In-Stat currently counts, more than half
of those 13.8 million networks in 2003 are expected to use
phone-line technology, according to Wolf's research.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology's development will follow the whims of the
consumers, says Funk.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, consumers are weighing their choices while assessing
the benefits of home networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the old days when there was one telephone
and everyone had to fight over it. There are lots of anecdotal
stories of schedules hung by the PC _ whoever has a school paper
due tomorrow gets to use the computer first,'' Funk said. ``(When)
the consumer can have multiple points in the house using an
Internet connection, there's no more fighting over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter which technology is used to realize those
multiple-access points, the impact on families _ and how families
communicate in the new millennium _ should be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, my son, wife and myself were all chatting with
grandpa at the same time,'' says Frank Romero, another home LAN
administrator who put a network into his Doraville home six months
ago when cable modem became available. ``He couldn't believe we
could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel offers another example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally one of the kids will write a paper for
homework,'' he says, ``and I can be downstairs, and Eric will say,
`Would you take a look at one of my homework papers?' And I can
call it up (on the network).''
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits will always carry a downside, like where,
exactly, is that line between dad and sysop drawn? Certainly the
home networking boom will bring its own set of intrafamilial
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the gateway out (to the Internet). But I respect their
privacy, I don't look at their e-mail,'' says Bodor, defining the
gray area between dad and netmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a user calling me (about network trouble) after 9
p.m., I got a problem.''

Apple turns the tables on PCs 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple Computer's once-crippling weakness has become
its strength.
</P>
<P>
   That weakness was, of course, Apple's Macs were not PCs. A year
ago, few people wanted a computer that didn't run Microsoft's
Windows operating system and all the software published for that
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Macs still aren't PCs, but now Apple has managed to turn that
distinction to its advantage. With the introduction of the iMac
last August, Apple's computers have once again become fashion
statements, a symbol that their owners are special and different.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of buyers are willing to pay a little extra for a
computer they believe is special. Mac users are paying more as
prices for computers in general are falling fast, hurting many PC
makers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some industry analysts are now saying Apple no
longer needs to convert PC users to its platform. The company can
prosper, they say, by just capturing a growing number of first-time
users with its iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the iMac phenomenon more evident than in Apple's
recently released third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Apple beat Wall Street's estimates that it would earn 64 cents a
share. Instead, the company reported net income of $114 million, or
69 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   What drove those results was the continuing surge in iMac sales.
Overall, sales of all Macs were up 40 percent from a year earlier _
twice the growth rate of the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Macs captured 11.5 percent of retail and mail-order sales
for computers during the first two months of this year, according
to market researcher PC Data. That figure is up from 6.3 percent a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the company's gross profit margin improved to 27.4
percent from 25.7 percent. The improvement was attributed to
falling prices for computer components.
</P>
<P>
   Such strong results are driving Apple's stock higher. It has
risen about 55 percent in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone views Apple's strong third-quarter results as
irrefutable evidence of a turnaround. Naysayers still see signs of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   They point, for example, to Apple's third-quarter revenue. It
grew at a much slower pace than unit sales, up only 11 percent to
$1.6 billion, compared with $1.4 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures portray a company that is still down sharply from
its peak of $11 billion in sales annually in the mid-1990s. Yet,
for Apple, those record sales were not translating into profit. The
company was losing hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, interim Chief Executive Steve Jobs has refashioned Apple
into a smaller company focused on three key markets: education,
home and desktop publishing. So far, it looks like a winning
strategy.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
NPR still sluggish, but at least it's trying 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When we last left our hero, the Web-challenged
National Public Radio, we were both amused and confused by NPR's
sheer lack of Web marketing know-how. Also taken to task were
Amazon.com and other online retailers for seriously underestimating
NPR's audience.
</P>
<P>
   In May, when I wrote the column about NPR's minimal use of the
Web, none of the big three booksellers was doing much to promote or
even stock NPR titles, which was odd, given the upscale, literate
and computer-savvy audience of NPR listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners were cheered somewhat several weeks ago when NPR
announced a deal to offer its programming on America Online. Users
who go to AOL keyword NPR will be connected to the latest news from
NPR in audio or video slide show format.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it seemed that NPR was hopping on the Web bandwagon in
a big way. A presence on AOL, consistently ranked the top news
destination on the Web by Media Metrix, would be a giant step
forward toward giving NPR a greater online presence.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that NPR will be a great asset to AOL's
already-considerable news area. Now users who are tired of generic
news have the option of tuning in to NPR's unique perspective on
world and national events. It's also a great opportunity for NPR to
put its best foot forward in front of AOL's 20 million users.
</P>
<P>
   However, NPR may have been smart enough to do the deal, but
still not smart enough to figure out how to build out its brand in
the interactive world. It makes you kind of want to shake your head
the way ABC newsman Ted Koppel did at presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis the night before Ronald Reagan won his landslide
victory in 1988, and mutter, ``You just don't get it, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   The NPR area of AOL is just as bland and boring and completely
devoid of personality as the NPR Web site. AOL users can listen to
NPR broadcasts without downloading any special software. This is
good. Listeners can also e-mail comments to NPR for possible on-air
reading. This is also good.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, here is where all the good things end. There are too many
missed opportunities to count. However, the area isn't even a month
old and, hopefully, there's a lot to this area users haven't seen
yet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is a link called ``transcripts,'' but all it
does is give you a phone number and an address to either call or
send away for tapes. Very reliable sources tell us that calling
this number to order tapes puts you into a voice mail system
reminiscent of Dante's seven circles of hell. Why NPR just doesn't
take advantage of AOL's infrastructure to let people order tapes
online is positively bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the message boards so listeners can e-mail such
airwave celebrities as Scott Simon, Nina Tottenberg or Terri Gross?
</P>
<P>
   It was encouraging to see a link called ``programs,'' but here
again, NPR drops the ball. Clicking any of the NPR programs listed
just gives you a written description _ a written description! _ of
the programs. At the very least there could have been a little
bitty sound clip of Gross plugging her wonderful show ``Fresh
Air.'' If there are issues involving rights and clearances that
keep NPR from putting more of its content online or making more of
it available online, please just tell us. We'll understand.
</P>
<P>
   However, users can link to the far more colorful Web sites for
member stations from Maine to California. Even the smallest site
for the smallest station in the smallest city lets users pledge
money, check out program schedules, volunteer, post messages and
provide feedback to the station. Makes you think, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the world waits for National Public Radio to
develop a Web strategy, Amazon and Borders were busy stocking up on
NPR-featured books and CDs. They were also busy building out
special areas for the items featured on NPR.
</P>
<P>
   Special mention goes to Borders.com, which also has an in-store
relationship with NPR. It went from a sad little NPR page that
didn't even have pictures of half the books to a pretty nice area
highlighted by some clever copy about how hard it is to keep track
of every book mentioned on NPR. However, the site gallantly offers
to try, and its selection is good. Amazon.com, which had a small
section devoted to NPR-featured materials, has added more stock to
its NPR area, which can be found in its ``As Featured in the
Media'' section.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, retailers don't need to be told twice when there's
money to be made on the Web. Hopefully, NPR will use its new home
on AOL to take advantage of the interactive as well as the audio
and text aspects of the Web and create something that will charm
longtime listeners and attract new ones.

THESE VIDEO CARDS ARE CERTIFIED WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In most cases, the capability of today's high-end computer
hardware far outstrips the ability of software to tame it. There's
one big exception, though, and that's 3D games.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who plays state-of-the-art games _ whether they're
action-packed first-person shooters, reflex-challenging real-time
strategy titles or hyper-realistic flight simulators _ is going to
want a video card that's at least a couple of steps ahead of the
programs being run.
</P>
<P>
   In a continuing series of columns on state-of-the-art video
cards, I've found two that are guaranteed winners. You can't go
wrong with either one of these.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rage Fury, $150, ATI Technologies: If you've bought an
off-the-shelf computer from a retailer over the past two years,
chances are very good it's got an ATI graphics adapter in it. The
older Rage Pro has been, well, all the rage with computer makers
because it delivers decent performance at a low price.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Rage Pro is far from being a high-end speed demon. It
was long ago eclipsed by cards that use graphics chips from nVidia,
S3 and 3dfx. In an attempt to reclaim the high end, ATI developed
and earlier this year released a series of cards based on its Rage
128 chipset.
</P>
<P>
   The Rage Fury is the AGP-bus model aimed at gamers. It comes
with 32 megabytes of fast video memory and the ability to connect
to a TV set in two ways _ with S-Video and composite video. It also
has a built-in DVD decoder, though it doesn't come with the
software needed to take advantage of this feature. An included
coupon lets you send off for this at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   The card can handle resolutions of up to 1,920-by-1,200 pixels,
and refresh rates as high 200 hertz. It also can use full 32-bit
color _ or 16.7 million colors _ at that maximum resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Modern graphics cards such as the Rage Fury all can handle the
standard 2D graphics used by traditional Windows applications with
incredible speed. Whether this is a high-performing 2D card is not
even a question _ if you're a mainstream Windows user, you'll love
it.
</P>
<P>
   The question is its 3D performance, and here it's no slouch. The
Rage Fury uses a 128-bit graphics engine, which refers to the
amount of information it can handle at once. It also has a clock
speed of 100 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   The look of 3D in both Microsoft's Direct3D and SGI's OpenGL 3D
schemes are excellent in 32-bit color, which is the Rage Fury's
strength. Although the colors are a bit saturated, particularly in
OpenGL, the look of the card was still gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   I tested this card's speed using the July 16 release of Quake
III Arena Test for Windows. This is the graphics and networking
test of id Software's upcoming Quake III Arena multiplayer game.
It's generally considered to be the software that most challenges
graphics cards at the moment, and it comes with a built-in way to
test the performance of cards. In the original release of Q3ATest,
as it's called, this so-called ``timedemo'' feature was broken. It
was fixed in the July 16 release.
</P>
<P>
   The computer I used was a Dell Dimension with a 500-Mhz Pentium
III chips and 250 megabytes of system memory.
</P>
<P>
   Q3ATest lets you tweak the graphics settings for either improved
speed or better visual quality. I tried four different settings,
ranging from the visually slick settings I use when I play the game
to a setting that emphasizes speed over beauty. The results are
measured in frames per second, or fps.
</P>
<P>
   In my favorite settings _ at a resolution of 1,024-by-768,
32-bit textures and 32-bit color _ the Rage Fury gave me 14.7 fps
in the Q3ATest timedemo. Moving to high-quality settings _
800-by-600, with 32-bit colors and textures _ I got 21.6 fps. At
normal settings _ 640-by-480, 32-bit colors and compressed textures
_ I got 35.4 fps. And at the fastest settings _ 640-by-480, 16-bit
colors and compressed textures _ I got 54.3 fps.
</P>
<P>
   The Rage Fury comes with demo versions of the games Half-Life
and Expendable, and a full version of Moto-Racer 2.
</P>
<P>
   _ 3D Blaster Riva TNT2 Ultra, $230, Creative Labs: Of the
graphics cards I've tried so far, this one is my favorite. It's
fast, it has a beautiful 3D look, its drivers are stable, and it
has most of the features computer enthusiasts will want.
</P>
<P>
   But it has two big negatives _ it comes with no bundled games,
and it's expensive.
</P>
<P>
   In May, I reviewed a test card from nVidia that used the Riva
TNT2 chipset and loved it. The TNT2 Ultra is essentially the same
chipset, but set at a higher clock speed.
</P>
<P>
   The AGP-bus card I tested came with 32 MB of fast video memory
and the capability to connect to a TV set using S-Video. It also
has 128-bit processing and runs at a clock speed of 150 Mhz, with
memory speed of 183 Mhz, which makes it lightning-fast. The card
also comes with a software utility that lets you increase these
speeds, called overclocking.
</P>
<P>
   It can handle resolutions up to 1,920-by-1,200, and refresh
rates up to 200 Hz. It also can handle 32-bit color at its maximum
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, I was a die-hard fan of the ``look'' of 3dfx's video
chipsets, particularly when it came to OpenGL and that company's
own Glide 3D scheme. But after experiencing the STB Velocity 4400
card _ which uses nVidia's original Riva TNT chip _ I was an
instant convert.
</P>
<P>
   The 3D images produced by nVidia's chips are nothing short of
jaw-dropping, and for the most part you don't sacrifice speed when
running at intensive color depths or detailed textures.
</P>
<P>
   It easily outran the Rage Fury except in one of the categories
in the Q3ATest _ the fastest setting. There, the ATI card whipped
upon the Creative Labs product by more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Using my favorite settings, the TNT2 Ultra-based achieved 21.6
fps. At the high-quality settings, it came in at 33 fps. For the
normal setting, I got 36.8 fps. And at the fastest setting, the
card hit 49.3 fps.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who's serious about 3D gaming, I would not hesitate
to recommend this card _ if you've got the bucks. But given the
price, it lacks some features that more mainstream users might
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Rage Fury, it will not do hardware-based DVD
decoding, though it will work with software-based DVD decoders. It
also does not have a composite video connection.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you're just getting started in 3D gaming and don't have
any titles to try out, you'll miss not having at least some demos
in the box.

COMPUTERS MAY EASE LIFE'S VEXATIONS  
 BY TOM STEIN  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hi, honey, how was your day?'' A sympathetic greeting from
your spouse after a hard day at the office? Today, yes. But
tomorrow, it could be from your personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what some of the top minds in the computer
industry believe. On July 22, an elite group gathered at IBM's
Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., for the seventh annual
New Paradigms for Using Computers Workshop. The event attracted
such visionaries as Gordon Bell of Microsoft and Will Wright,
creator of the popular SimCity software game.
</P>
<P>
   They came together to explore the outer boundaries of computer
technology and find ways to give PCs a human face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers will know us better than we know ourselves and will
make the best decisions for us,'' said Ted Selker, an IBM Fellow
and the brains behind the annual conference. ``It's already
starting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a personal computer that knows when you're happy or
sad. Or a clothing rack in a department store that understands your
tastes and preferences better than you do. Or a car phone that
knows not to distract you when you're weaving through traffic. Or
even a steak knife that sniffs out bad meat before you eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Picard, a presenter at the conference and a professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, said we are
fast approaching the age of ``affective computing.'' Essentially,
this means people will begin to interact with computers the same
way they do with other humans.
</P>
<P>
   These days computers that try to show signs of ``intelligence''
often end up being annoying. For example, a user of Microsoft Word
may occasionally see random messages pop up on screen with
instructions on how to better work with the software.
</P>
<P>
   But something your computer cannot do is gauge your reaction to
that message.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone gives you advice at a bad time or when you're
really busy, you may try to ignore them or glare at them to go
away,'' said Picard. ``Usually, they'll get the gist and back
off.'' Computers do not have the emotional intelligence to pick up
on these signals.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a host of technologists including Picard strive to
teach computers to recognize human feelings and react in the
appropriate manner.
</P>
<P>
   So how should a computer act? According to Picard, it should act
like a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come home from work, your dog is so happy to see
you,'` she said. ``But if you're in a bad mood, your dog will
somehow sense that and assume an empathetic position. Machines,
too, must give the illusion of empathy and sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists at IBM are weighing in with their own creations.
At the workshop, IBM displayed for the first time its Emotion
Mouse, which can measure heart rate and body temperature and
ultimately sense whether the user is happy, sad, angry, fearful or
perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Though still a prototype, the Emotion Mouse may be ready to hit
the market in one or two years, according to the scientists at IBM.
As for a practical application, IBM believes the product could be
ideal for people who work in call centers. ``The goal of a call
center manager is to take his people off the job before they go
berserk,'' said IBM's Chris Dryer. ``Emotion Mouse can sense when
call-center reps are getting frustrated and can let them know they
should take a break.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM is in the early stages of piloting another intelligent
system called Simple User Interest Tracker (Suitor) that pays
attention to a computer user's behavior and actions. Through a
miniature camera embedded in a monitor, Suitor carefully follows
the user's gaze to determine his or her interests and information
needs. The tracking system is called ``BlueEyes.''
</P>

HOSTILITIES CONTINUE BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND AOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hostilities continued Tuesday in the bitter debate over whether
Microsoft should be able to link into America Online's popular
instant message system, with Microsoft rebuffing America Online's
invitation to discuss a possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   The war broke out last week when Microsoft Corp. introduced new
software that allows users to send instant messages both to users
of Microsoft's Hotmail service and to users of the America Online
service and others who use the AOL Instant Messenger, or AIM,
software. America Online said Microsoft was acting like a hacker,
connecting to its system without authorization.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent days, Microsoft has issued several new versions of
its software as America Online has cut off each preceding version.
On Friday, America Online sent a letter to Microsoft, demanding
that Microsoft stop using its system but inviting the company to
negotiate some sort of message exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response Tuesday, Brad Chase, a vice president of
Microsoft, asserted that Microsoft had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been and is no unauthorized use or access of AOL's
services or products,'' Chase wrote. ``Nor has Microsoft violated
the privacy or security of any AIM users.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter had no direct response to America Online's invitation
to discuss an accord. Rather, Chase simply called on America Online
to stop its efforts to block Microsoft's software.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's reaction was quick and stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear from reading their letter that America Online and
Microsoft still have significant disagreements on privacy and
security,'' said Kenneth Lerer, a principal with Robinson Lerer,
America Online's public relations firm. As for Microsoft's reaction
to America Online's invitation, Lerer said ``their silence speaks
for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Bennet, a product manager in Microsoft's consumer and
commerce business, said that America Online was not in fact
amenable to discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their letter was not a negotiation but a club,'' Bennet said.
He said that Microsoft wanted to work for an open standard through
an industry consortium rather than to negotiate a bilateral deal
with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Lerer of America Online said that the company believes that
instant messaging will ultimately be open so that users of any
instant message software will be able to communicate with users of
any other such program. Currently each system is in effect a closed
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Internet industry executives, however, said they saw no
indication that America Online is moving to open its base of 40
million instant message users to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, America Online cut off instant messaging systems from
Prodigy and Yahoo that also had found a way to link to the America
Online system. Prodigy and Yahoo officials say that America Online
has made no efforts to indicate the terms on which it would allow
access.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, America Online has not been active in the industry
task force that has been trying to write open standards for instant
messages, said Vijay Saraswat, a researcher for AT&AMP;T Labs and the
co-chair of the task force. Microsoft has been active in the task
force and has proposed a standard. But Saraswat said that Microsoft
has yet to show a commitment to those standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online is not alone,'' he said. ``Microsoft is not
following a public protocol, even though they had proposed one.''

GOVERNMENT PROPOSES TO MONITOR BANKING AND OTHER COMPUTER
NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Exclusive) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has developed a plan for an extensive
computer monitoring system, overseen by the FBI, to protect the
nation's crucial data networks from intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, an outgrowth of the administration's anti-terrorism
program, has already raised concerns from civil liberties groups.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the plan, prepared by officials at the National
Security Council last month and provided to The New York Times by a
civil liberties group, calls for a sophisticated software system to
monitor activities on non-military government networks and a
separate system to track networks used in the banking,
telecommunications and transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, whose details are still being debated within the
administration, is intended to alert law enforcement officials to
attacks that might cripple governmental operations or the nation's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the increasing power of the nation's computers
and their emerging role as a backbone of the nation's commerce,
politics and culture, critics of the proposed system say it could
become a building block for a surveillance infrastructure with
great potential for misuse.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that such a network of monitoring programs could
itself be open to security breaches, giving intruders or
unauthorized users a vast window into government and corporate
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department began deploying such a system three years
ago. But Government officials said that the changing nature of
military threats in the information age had altered the nature of
national security concerns and created a new sense of urgency to
protect the nation's information infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern about organized cyber attack has escalated
dramatically,'' Jeffrey Hunker, the National Security Council's
director of information protection, who is overseeing the plan,
said Tuesday. ``We do know of a number of hostile foreign
governments that are developing sophisticated and well organized
offensive cyber attack capabilities and we have good reason to
believe that terrorists may be developing similar capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan, networks of thousands of software
monitoring programs would constantly track computer activities,
looking for indications of computer network intrusions and other
illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the creation of a Federal Intrusion Detection
Network, or Fidnet, and specifies that the data it collects will be
gathered in a centralized data center at the National
Infrastructure Protection Center, an interagency task force housed
at the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system, to be put fully in place by 2003, is meant to
permit government security experts to track ``patterns of
patterns'' of information and respond in a coordinated manner
against intruders and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The plan focuses on monitoring data flowing over government and
national computer networks. That means the systems would
potentially have access to computer-to- computer communications
like electronic mail and other documents, computer programs and
remote log-ins.
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing percentage of network traffic, like banking
and financial information, is routinely encrypted and would not be
visible to the monitor software. Government officials argue that
they are not interested in eavesdropping, but rather are looking
for patterns of behavior that suggest illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, the Pentagon has begun to string
together entire network surveillance systems by instrumenting them
with filters that report data to a central site, much as a burglar
alarm might be reported at the local police station.
</P>
<P>
   For example, officials said that such a system might have
protected against intrusions recently reported in computers at the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces information like the
consumer price index that can affect the performance of the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report, which has been circulated widely within the
executive branch, has generated concern among some officials over
its privacy implications. Several officials involved in the debate
over the plan said that the situation was ``fluid'' and that many
aspects were still not final.
</P>
<P>
   The report is vague on several crucial points, including the
kinds of data to be collected and the specific federal and
corporate computer networks to be monitored. The report also lacks
details about the ways information collected in non-governmental
agencies would be maintained and under what conditions it would be
made available to law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that the National Security Council was
conducting a legal and technical review of the plan and that a
final report is scheduled to be released in September, subject to
President Clinton's approval.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The plan was created in response to a presidential directive in
May 1998 requiring the executive branch to review the
vulnerabilities of the federal government's computer systems in
order to become a ``model of information and security.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cover letter to the draft plan Clinton writes, ``A
concerted attack on the computers of any one of our key economic
sectors or governmental agencies could have catastrophic effects.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan strikes at the heart of a growing controversy over
how to protect the nation's computer systems while also protecting
civil liberties _ particularly since it would put a new and
powerful tool into the hands of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, data flowing over the Internet is becoming a vital
tool for law enforcement, and civil liberties experts said law
enforcement agencies would be under great temptation to expand the
use of the information in pursuit of suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report clearly recognizes the civil liberties
implications,'' said James X. Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center
for Democracy and Technology, a Washington civil liberties group,
``But it brushes them away.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft plan states: ``As access to relevant networks is
premised on `consent' of the user to allow session monitoring, the
collection of certain data identified as anomalous activity or a
suspicious event would not be considered a privacy issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey conceded the legal validity of the point, but said there
was tremendous potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is that Fidnet is an ill-defined monitoring
system of potentially broad sweep,'' he said. ``It seems to place
monitoring and surveillance at the center of the government's
response to a problem that is not well suited to such measures.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is making a concerted effort to insure
that civil liberties and privacy rights are not violated by the
plan, Hunker said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that data gathered from non-government computer networks
will be collected separately from the FBI-controlled monitoring
system at a separate location within a General Services
Administration building. He said that was done to keep
non-government data at arm's length from law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also has drawn concern from civil libertarians because
it blends civilian and military functions in protecting the
nation's computer networks. The report notes that there is already
a Department of Defense ``contingent'' working at the FBI's
infrastructure protection center to integrate intelligence,
counterintelligence and law enforcement efforts in protecting
Pentagon computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight over this could make the fight over encryption look
like nothing,'' said Mary Culnan, an professor at Georgetown
University who served on a presidential commission whose work led
to the May 1998 directive on infrastructure protection. ``The
conceptual problem is that there are people running this program
who don't understand how citizens feel about privacy in
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been discussing the proposal widely with a
number of industry security committees and associations in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry executives said there is still reluctance on
the part of industry to directly share information on computer
intrusions with law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to control the decision-making process,'' said Mark
Rasch, vice president and general counsel of Global Integrity, a
company in Reston, Va., that coordinates computer security for the
financial services industries.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem in carrying out the government's plan is
that intrusion-detection software technology is still immature,
industry executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial intrusion detection systems are not ready for
prime time,'' said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI
International in Menlo Park, Calif., and a pioneer in the field of
intrusion detection systems.
</P>
<P>
   Current systems tend to generate false alarms and thus require
many skilled operators.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant portion of the $1.4 billion the Clinton
administration has requested for computer security for fiscal year
2000 is intended to be spent on research, and government officials
said they were hopeful that the planned effort would be able to
rely on automated detection technologies and on artificial
intelligence capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For several years computer security specialists have used
software variously known as packet filters or ``sniffers'' as
monitoring devices to track computer intruders. Like telephone
wiretaps, such tools can be used to reconstruct the activities of a
computer user as if a videotape were made of his computer display.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the software tools are routinely
misused by illicit computer network users to steal information such
as passwords or other data.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, commercial vendors are beginning to sell monitoring
tools that combine packet filtering with more sophisticated and
automated intrusion detection software that tries to detect abuse
by looking for behavior patterns or certain sequences of commands.

   Special-interest tours are for travelers who realize that
there's more than one way to see the world. It might be flowers or
wine, architecture or music. But by focusing on a specific
activity, the best special interest tours can actually reveal an
entire culture in a unique way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these tours are led by professionals or academics.
Typically, they provide access to private homes and villas, or
offer guest lecturers or instructors.
</P>
<P>
   These tours are popular because enthusiasts, whether of art,
architecture or wine, like to travel with like-minded companions.
</P>
<P>
   The number of special-interest tour companies grows larger every
year, and their offerings increase as well. Here's a sampling of
what's available. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy,

activity, the best special interest tours can actually reveal an
entire culture in a unique way.

architecture or wine, like to travel with like-minded companions.

year, and their offerings increase as well. Here's a sampling of
what's available. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy,

SEEMS ROSS ISN'T THE BOSS THESE DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you like that? Ross Perot creates a political party to
feed his insatiable appetite for notoriety and power _ and now the
party won't so much as toss him a crumb.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party wouldn't even go along with Perot's choice for
chairman during its weekend convention in Michigan. Seems Ross the
Boss isn't the boss anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Which should surprise exactly no one. When you've heard Perot's
shtick once, you've heard it a thousand times. Who needs to hear it
again?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the bottom line, as Ross would say: The wheels came off
the Perot bandwagon long ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that simple.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens to the Reform Party now?
</P>
<P>
   Early converts to Perot's ``grassroots'' organization deluded
themselves into believing that they had some relevance separate
from Perot's monumental ego. But they were puppets, dancing to the
founder's tune even as he proclaimed himself to be the humble
servant of his ``volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that the volunteers have finally figured out
that Perot is a self-serving phony whose short-lived emergence as a
player on the stage of national politics was nothing but a mirage
conjured up by Perot at the expense of a frustrated electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Perot, it must be noted that he evidently retains
a loyal if shrinking army of Perotistas who would still march into
fire if he gave the order. USA Today reported that more than 22
percent of delegates participating in a convention straw poll named
Perot as their first choice to be the party's presidential nominee
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But then, winning a poll in which the runner-up was Donald Trump
_ 17.5 percent _ may have been a hollow victory for the original
Scheming Weasel. It certainly won't do much in the way of igniting
another ``Perot for President'' movement.
</P>
<P>
   The only person capable of firing up the Reform Party nowadays,
it would seem, is the party's only big-deal officeholder, Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura. Notwithstanding Ventura's eighth-place finish
in the presidential straw poll _ he insists that he won't run for
president _ the former pro wrestler may well be the party's new
puppeteer.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventura-backed candidate won the party chairmanship, and
Ventura has clearly elbowed Perot out of the spotlight to position
himself as the most vocal and visible Reformer on the planet. It
surely won't be long before Ventura is babbling about being a
humble servant of the volunteers or some such.
</P>
<P>
   Take this to the bank: If Ventura wants to run for president, he
will set it up to appear that the Reform Party has insisted on it.
He really has no interest in running, he'll say, but he can't turn
his back on the organization that welcomed him with open arms way
back when he was a no-chance candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you suppose these characters always want to create the
illusion that somebody is begging them to run? Why can't they just
tell the truth: ``I'm running for the highest office in the land
because I'm a power-hungry egomaniac and I want to be president so
much I can taste it.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd almost have to vote for a candidate who said that, just
out of gratitude for his honesty.
</P>
<P>
   It's all academic, of course, because the Reform Party was dead
on arrival. The third-party movement peaked early in Perot's first
run for president in 1992, before the third party even existed.
</P>
<P>
   Perot was a one-man show who invented the Reform Party for the
purpose of institutionalizing his presidential ambitions _ and
fostering the deception that his pursuit of high office was about
something other than Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura and others are bravely attempting to salvage the
wreckage that Perot left behind, but they are wasting their time.
</P>
<P>
   With all its flaws, the two-party system has served this country
well, and it will continue to do so. American voters love to
complain about it, insult it, threaten it. When all is said and
done, though, we always come back to the system that we know and
understand.
</P>
<P>
   And when all is said and done, the system usually works just
fine.

FBI'S YOSEMITE EFFORTS CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a U.S. senator and the relatives of victims
questioned the FBI's investigation into four murders that have
shaken Yosemite National Park, a cab driver who gave the confessed
killer a two-hour ride from one of the crime scenes said the bureau
had failed to contact her.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Paul told The San Francisco Examiner that around Feb. 15
she picked up a man matching accused killer Cary Stayner's
description from Sierra Village _ near where the bodies of Yosemite
tourists Carole Sund and Silvina Pelosso were later found dead in
the trunk of their rented car _ and gave him a $170 cab ride back
to Yosemite Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But while it is routine police practice to canvass public
transportation operators in the area of a major crime, she said no
investigator contacted her or her husband, Geza Horvath, who run
Courtesy Cab Co. in Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   And though she later thought about phoning the FBI about her
unusual passenger after hearing that Pelosso, Sund and Sund's
daughter, Juli, disappeared last Feb. 15, she didn't because the
bureau by then had announced that all the suspects were in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' she said. ``It was a shot in the dark. Plus, they
later said they had caught the people.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until she saw Stayner's face on television Sunday
following his arrest as a suspect in the killing of park naturalist
Joie Armstrong that she believed she'd had the alleged killer in
her gray, four-door 1994 Chevrolet Caprice cab. She then called the
FBI, which sent agents who duly took down her information.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was critical because it placed him in the area,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Rossi, an FBI spokesman in Sacramento, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A month after they disappeared, the charred bodies of Carole
Sund and Pelosso were found in their burned-out rental car near
Long Barn, not far from Sierra Village. Juli's nearly decapitated
body was found a week later near Don Pedro Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had interviewed Stayner soon after their murders,
but they rejected him as a suspect. That decision has come under
fire in the wake of Stayner's reported confession that he killed
all four women.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said the ``dismissal of Cary Stayner as a suspect ... by
the FBI means that the latest killing may have been preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Pelosso, Silvina's mother, said she couldn't see how the
FBI missed Stayner, who worked as a handyman at the Cedar Lodge
Motel, where the three sightseers were staying the night they
disappeared as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI interviewed him early on along with other motel
employees and dismissed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the FBI was on the right path before, and now it
shows that they were wrong, or they were not (looking at) the right
people,'' Pelosso said in a phone interview from her Argentina
home. ``We were really sorry this had to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tron Brekke, deputy assistant director of the FBI in Washington,
D.C., defended the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, you're limited by the facts you develop,'' he
said. ``These are not for the most part Perry Mason moments, where
you interview somebody and they immediately confess. They aren't
solved in 30 minutes, like on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, 37, reportedly confessed to all four killings after his
arrest Saturday, sought because his car was seen near the cabin of
his latest victim. Armstrong, 26, a naturalist for the Yosemite
Institute, was reported missing last Wednesday and her decapitated
body was found in the park Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report broadcast Wednesday, KNTV in San Jose said that
Stayer confessed in a jailhouse interview that he has fantasized
about killing women since childhood and committed all of the crimes
because he ``couldn't help himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, who was being held without bail in Sacramento County
Jail, claims he acted alone. He is the only person charged in the
case, and has been charged only with Armstrong's murder.
</P>
<P>
   The homicides have stirred enormous concern across the West,
because Yosemite, which is about 150 miles east of San Francisco,.
is a premier vacation destination, drawing 4 million visitors a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The case also has drawn criticism of the FBI amid signs that the
agency's task force investigating the killings might have focused
on the wrong suspects, alleged members of a local, loose-knit group
of petty criminals and methamphetamine abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these backwoods dwellers _ whom local police call
``cranksters'' because they say their drug of choice is called
crank on the street _ have been in custody for unrelated crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have said it was too soon to conclude
Stayner acted alone.

ETHICON HIT WITH LAWSUITS CLAIMING CONTAMINATED SURGICAL SUTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A medical manufacturer has been hit with a new flurry of
lawsuits in connection with an infection outbreak allegedly caused
by contaminated surgical sutures.
</P>
<P>
   In two class-action suits filed earlier this month, seven
surgical patients in California and Nevada charged that they had
suffered raging infections because the Johnson &AMP; Johnson subsidiary
Ethicon Inc. allegedly distributed sutures contaminated with
infectious bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   One suit was filed in Superior Court in San Francisco, and the
other in U.S. District Court in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where
Ethicon has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The patients charged that they became gravely ill because
Ethicon had sold millions of its trademark Vicryl dissolving
sutures in 1994 even though the products had been contaminated
during processing in a breakdown-prone sterilizer unit.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied its products caused anyone to become ill.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen people who suffered infection have sued Ethicon since
The San Francisco Examiner published ``Outbreak,'' a series of
stories about a sterilizer breakdown at an Ethicon plant in San
Angelo, Texas, and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The stories quoted lawsuits and U.S. Food and Drug
Administration records indicating that more than 100 patients in
California and eight other states had blamed Ethicon sutures for
fierce post-surgical infections, many caused by staphylococcus and
a rare bacteria related to tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Months after problems were first noted in the sterilizer, the
FDA prodded the firm into issuing a voluntary recall for 3.6
million of the sutures, federal records show.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 70 percent of the sutures were not recovered,
according to the FDA. And starting shortly after the sutures were
first distributed, patients began complaining that the sutures had
made them ill.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers and patients contend it is likely that there were
many others across the country who suffered infections and never
learned the cause of their mysterious ailments.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Congress and in lawsuits, Ethicon has acknowledged
problems with the sterilizer unit, but contended that all the
sutures it sold were safe. Since the incident, the firm has made
confidential settlements with 22 victims who blamed the sutures for
their infections, according to public records.
</P>
<P>
   In the new suits, the patients accused the firm of seeking to
conceal the risks posed by the sutures. They claimed they never
would have known that sutures caused their medical problems but for
the nationwide publicity that followed The San Francisco Examiner's
stories in February.
</P>
<P>
   Infection victims from around the United States continue to come
forward because of the stories, said Sacramento lawyer Wendy York,
who filed the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the most ineffective recalls I have ever
seen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she filed dual class-action complaints in hopes of
improving victims' chances of prevailing.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH MAKING AUDIENCES FEEL GOOD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By MARLA MATZER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Director Garry Marshall isn't into preaching
family values, but he seems to practice them both on and off the
set. On screen, Marshall's signature is sweet, often nostalgic
comedies. For television, he created and executive produced such
shows as ``Happy Days'' and ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley''; his movie
credits include ``The Flamingo Kid'' and ``Beaches,'' in addition
to ``Runaway Bride,'' the Julia Roberts/Richard Gere romantic
comedy opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall makes no apologies for making feel-good entertainment.
``People often say my films are too sweet ... That's OK,'' said
Marshall. With his thick Bronx accent and self-effacing manner,
he's a favorite of actors to both work with and imitate. At a
recent round of interviews for ``Bride,'' every actor, from Gere to
Rita Wilson to Hector Elizondo, had his or her own impression of
the affable Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that part of my directing style is that if I allow them
to make fun of me, then I can make fun of them, and we can all
relax,'' Marshall said, while fiddling with a toothpick (a
substitute for a cigarette; he kicked smoking more than a decade
ago, he says). ``A lot of people say you have to be above it all to
be an authority figure. One of my cinematographers told me I should
stand on a ladder, that that's how you direct. But I think it's
what you say, not where you stand, that puts you in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Another secret to Marshall's success is working well with
members of his family. He directed his sister, Penny Marshall (now
a director herself) in ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley.'' Now, he often uses
his son Scott as a second-unit director and has worked with
daughter Lori, who's a writer.
</P>
<P>
   His children wear many hats on his productions _ on ``Bride,''
for example, his son played bass in an impromptu scene where Gere
plays with a band on the street, while Lori stepped in to help Joan
Cusack and Julia Roberts improvise some dialogue in another scene.
That's one reason Marshall likes working with them. ``I find that I
can talk shorthand with them. I find that they will help my work
and not have an ego problem,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just his own kids who are benefiting from
Marshall's show-business experience. In November 1997, Marshall
opened the Falcon Theatre in Burbank, partly as a venue to
introduce young people to theater and to season up-and-coming
writers and actors who later may move into film and television.
</P>
<P>
   The theater sponsors an annual young playwright's competition
for students around the country and puts on plays for both adults
and children. Lori Marshall wrote a version of ``Rapunzel'' that
recently was staged at the theater; Gary's daughter Kathleen has
produced shows there, and Scott has directed.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said a big hope for the 99-seat theater is to create a
kind of farm team for TV and movies. ``I think you've got to
develop some writers and actors,'' Marshall said. ``In live
theater, not so much is at stake. The budgets are so high on movies
now ... vaudeville's out now, the clubs are out, so there's nowhere
else for these people to develop.'' &QL;

POPULAR FRENCH DIRECTOR GETTING HIS DUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Love and money were just fine, thank you. But
respect is also very nice.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Veber has had an abundance of the former and, just
recently, a very satisfying smattering of the latter. Arguably
France's most successful filmmaker of the last 30 years, Veber has
written and/or directed a raft of broad farces (``La Cage aux
Folles,'' ``The Tall Blonde Man With One Black Shoe,'' ``La
Chevre,'' ``Les Comperes'') that have been huge box-office
successes and inspirations for numerous American remakes, from the
dire ``Quick Change'' and ``Buddy Buddy'' to impressive hits like
``The Birdcage.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though his films have attracted such respected actors
as Gerard Depardieu, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Lino Ventura and Jacques
Brel, Veber has rarely impressed critics or colleagues. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game,'' just released in America, was typically a
big hit in France. The difference was, it also got great reviews,
won three Oscar-equivalent Cesar Awards and triggered the
first-ever film festival retrospective of Veber's work at last
spring's prestigious Cannes conclave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd made a big effort, myself, to try to say that I don't care
about tributes and acclaim, because I would never have them,''
Veber, a trim and understatedly gracious man in his early 60s, said
during an interview at his elegant, Mediterranean-style home above
the Sunset Strip. ``And then it happened to me, you know? I was
surprised how emotional it was and how touched I was. For the first
time, the business was telling me, `You are a part of us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I always considered me, like, a craftsman,'' Veber continued
in clear, if slightly imperfect, English. ``I was doing my little
work, very precisely. It is very difficult to write comedy, you
know? But for people to finally tell me I am not a bad craftsman
... that is very good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game,'' which Veber adapted and directed from his
long-running Paris stage play, is rather revealingly about the
dynamic tension between sneering contempt and grudging respect. It
stars Thierry Lhermitte as a snooty publisher involved in ``idiot
dinners'' with his nasty friends. The object of their dinner game
is to seek out and invite the most pathetic losers they can find to
the party; the guy who brings the biggest imbecile wins.
</P>
<P>
   Lhermitte's Pierre thinks he's hit paydirt with the bumbling,
disheveled, roly poly Francois (Jacques Villeret), a divorced,
woebegone tax accountant who pours his energy into building
matchstick models of the Eiffel Tower and other such edifices. But
through a night of escalating catastrophes, the well-meaning but
hopelessly inept Francois practically destroys his false new
friend's life _ and eventually convinces Pierre of his admirable
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in the fact that some people can be
contemptuous enough to think that they are smarter than others and
choose a jerk in a very arbitrary way,'' Veber explained. ``I
wanted to punish one of those guys. This game, you know, exists in
Paris. I have friends _ friends? _ who did it, and I was horrified.
So I decided to punish one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you can blurt a knee-jerk ``sounds French to me,'' Veber
points out that such callous smugness exists in all cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you have dogfights in America,'' he said. ``I've heard
these horrible stories about college boys in fraternities inviting
the ugliest girl to a party and she doesn't know it. Now, that's
cruel! I think, in that kind of cruelty, we're equal in every
country.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the humor he milks from
self-styled-smart-vs.-unselfconsciously-dumb matchups, Veber
strives to humanize both factors in his comedy equation by the time
the story's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of my films have exactly this same sort of odd couple,''
Veber acknowledged. ``It's the same two guys. One is supposed to be
the tough, big, smarter one, and the other is supposed to be more
ridiculous and weaker. But by the end, you don't know who is really
which.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are reasons why I always do these mismatched buddy
movies,'' he further explained. ``First, I like friendship, and I'm
not very good at writing women. But the main thing is, those two
characters are two parts of my own character. I dream of being the
strong one, but very often I am the ridiculous one. I want to be
Depardieu, the guy who walks into a bar and everybody stops
speaking. But when I walk into a bar, I'm more likely to fall on a
banana peel.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Veber's sense of humor used to generate more trouble
than success. A joke he made while in the army during the Algerian
War landed him in the brig, and his tendency to laugh at life
contributed to a failed stint in medical school and an
undistinguished journalistic career.
</P>
<P>
   He had always wanted to write creatively, but his parents, both
authors, had had such little success in the field _ his mother was
an Armenian immigrant who wrote low-paying romance novels, his
Jewish father's career was damaged beyond recovery during the Nazi
occupation of Paris _ that they dissuaded their son from pursuing
it.
</P>
<P>
   But after failing as a doctor, a soldier and a reporter, Veber
wrote a play. It got produced, it was popular, it soon led to movie
work, and he's been at it ever since. Married for 35 years, he and
his wife, Francoise, have two adult sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are screenwriters, which panics me,'' Veber deadpanned,
chipping off the old block. ``I would prefer for them to be
dentists or attorneys, but I cannot do anything. They are
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Veber is working for DreamWorks on an American version of
``Dinner Game,'' which he plans to direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the French movie was so well-directed that it made
sense to have the guy who not only authored that movie, but
directed it, do the the remake,'' said Bob Cooper, DreamWorks' head
of feature production and development. ``We feel very protected
because Francis did such a great job, and he's got one of the most
extraordinary track records of anybody in comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Veber claimed he's past the stage of blindly capitalizing on
past successes now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I've reached an age now where I need to do
things that I really love 100 percent,'' said Veber, whose two
previous American directing jobs split 50-50; ``Three Fugitives''
was a happy experience, ``Out on a Limb'' was not.
</P>
<P>
   But Veber insists that, though he has gotten more selective, the
recent acclaim has not gone to his head. Although the ongoing
motifs and personal expression that is now evident in his body of
work marks him as a true French auteur, he refuses to think of
himself as anything more serious than a practitioner of the tricky
art of clowning around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nowhere in any pantheon,'' he stated bluntly. ``You have
to be modest. You can't brag when you write comedies. Colleagues of
mine who write one or two serious movies become stars in a snap.
I've done 27; it's a very long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I kind of like it because you are obliged to
work harder and harder. People don't understand how difficult it is
to put two guys on a couch and entertain an audience for 80
minutes. You have to make people forget that they don't have their
usual special effects, car chases, violence, sex and things like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if it works, it's a piece of luck.'' &UR;  &QL;

Indeed, the Big Board and its chief executive, Richard A. Grasso,
face a daunting array of challenges as they search for a survival
strategy. The exchange must protect its franchise and find a way to

A DOSE OF HMO IS BAD MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's the job of medicine to help people die young
as late in life as possible. Supposedly, it's the job of health
insurance companies to assist in that chore.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, though, the healers and their patients are
at war with health insurance company bean counters. As the
population ages and the cost of medical care shoots up, health
insurers struggle to save money while physicians and patients
struggle to obtain adequate care.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, all three sides in this epic clash seem to be
losing. Nobody understands that better than Elsa Goldstein. She had
a medical emergency one night not long ago. She went to a hospital
emergency room, was given a medication in the hospital by a
physician and a prescription that the doctor wrote for aftercare.
She had to take this stuff twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the local pharmacy,'' she told me, ``where I have
coverage through my HMO, and it was rejected. They wanted to charge
me $109 for this medication.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``The pharmacist told you that the insurance company
wouldn't pay for this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' Elsa Goldstein said. ``I had to call the
insurance company, and they said they would not pay because it was
not the HMO doctor who wrote the prescription. So, I went home, and
I called the insurance company again, and the gentleman who
answered the phone told me that they wouldn't pay for a
prescription written by a doctor who was not on their panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I explained that I was seen by an emergency room physician
and that he gave me the prescription. And he said, `It still has to
be written by your primary care doctor.'''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``That doctor's office is closed now, and I need to take
this medicine tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``It still has to be written by your primary care
doctor. Anyway, that drug isn't on formula, and we wouldn't pay for
it anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said, ``Why don't you take _ and he mentioned an
over-the-counter preparation instead.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which seriously annoyed Elsa Goldstein because she
happens to be a physician herself. Dr. Goldstein spent many years
in training to learn which medications are appropriate for which
ailments. This guy on the other end of the phone was recommending
something that not only wouldn't work but could cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incorrect medical advice,'' she told me. ``It was
dangerous medical advice ... Fortunately, I knew better than to
take his advice. But, also, this was illegal. He was practicing
medicine without a license.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Goldstein is a colon-rectal surgeon. She spent a decade as
an HMO employee before she went into private practice and began
using her husband's medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The transition was a shock of profound proportions. She'd had
fine health care as an HMO employee. But, as a non-connected
consumer of health care, everything was different.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Goldstein understood the HMO rules. She knew what was
covered. But her HMO just wouldn't pay for covered services. Time
and again, they would allege that they hadn't been billed properly
or even billed at all _ even when the bill was faxed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Goldstein suspects that this HMO is simply refusing to pay
and hoping that nervous patients, dunned enough times, will pay
instead, even though they shouldn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated incidents of this, she wrote a letter of
complaint to the New York State Insurance Department. The fact is,
though, that the managed care system is less about care than about
costs. The insurance companies exhibit little to zero concern for
prolonging human life and preventing human suffering.
</P>
<P>
   And, in case you haven't noticed, the politicians are doing
nothing much to fix that.

SHE'S US POSTAL'S SOIGNEUR PAR EXCELLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARBES, France _ Yes, US Postal Service bicycle team director
Johan Bruyneel knows a lot about his riders legs and the strength
that makes them go. But someone else has a pretty good idea, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's Emma O'Reilly, the head soigneur on the team, or the
person who serves as combination masseuse, nutritionist, and
confidante. The team has four soigneurs to look after the nine
riders, and O'Reilly is the head one who is assigned to Tour winner
Lance Armstrong and teammate Kevin Livingston. After every race for
the past three weeks, she's the one who has loosened their leg
muscles, listened to their moods, and mostly been the quiet leader
behind the team and the member who won the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly will travel with Armstrong to whatever races he enters
with the Postal Service team through this season, which ends in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Soigneurs have always played an important role in cycling. But
mirroring the male environment of European proofessional bicycling,
women have rarely, if ever, been admitted to the club. That meant
wives and girlfriends were off limits during the race, and of
course a woman was never a staff member.
</P>
<P>
   But leave it to the Americans to break that barrier. When
7-Eleven, the first US-based team to ride the Tour, entered it in
1986, the roster included two women soigneurs. In America, it's
typical to have women work on men's teams, so why not in Europe?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the breakthough didn't seem to have any impact, and when
the 7-Eleven folded and left Eruope, so did women's participation.
</P>
<P>
   Enter O'Reilly, who was signed with the Postal Service team when
it was formed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gorski, the general manager, acknowledges that he had
underestimated her influence on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we didn't know how much better she'd be than a
guy soigneur, but she's just phenomenal,'' he said. ``She just has
more sensitivity, knows what the guys need. She's professional and
has a great attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he said, she was looked upon as a publicity gimmick by
the other European teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only team in professional cycling that has a woman
soigneur, and initially they thought we were crazy, that we were
unfocused,'' he said. ``But now I think lot of teams realize we
have an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, on one of the team's rare days off in the Tour, sits
in her small hotel room that is crammed with her luggage, as well
as coolers of water, boxes of cereal, and her folded-up massage
table leaning against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the other soigneurs have driven to town to pick up more
groceries, while another is doing the riders' laundry in the washer
and dryer in the team's truck.
</P>
<P>
   Her work will involve giving massages to Armstrong and
Livingston after their training rides, filling the riders' musettes
(feed bags) with processed food and energy bars, and generally
looking after the riders' non-racing needs like making sure enough
liters of bottled water are put inside every room.
</P>
<P>
   The soigneurs will eat dinner after the riders that night, and
before the riders the next morning. Then they'll finish filling the
feed bags with omelet cakes and paninis (rolls filled with cream
cheese), drive ahead to the ``feed zone'' halfway down the race
course, and stand on the side of the road to dangle the musettes
for the racers to grab as they ride by. After that, it's a rushed
drive on back roads to get to the finish before the men do and
position themselves at the line to greet the riders and steer them
toward the team car to take them to their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the soigneurs will get to the hotel, set up their
massage tables to rub down each rider, and think about having
dinner before they do it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, with auburn hair and a lilting Irish accent, is
nothing like the mostly large, French, Spanish, and
Italian-speaking men who surround her on the course.
</P>
<P>
   She stumbled onto her current job when she and her family used
to travel around Ireland to watch her brother race. After high
school, O'Reilly, 29, enrolled in electrician's trade school, took
massage and sports injury courses, then started doing massages part
time.
</P>
<P>
   When she was asked to be a soigneur on the Irish national team,
she leapt at the chance, but not really from a passion for cycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really did it because I could take holidays with the
national team,'' O'Reilly said as her eyes lit up. ``I mean,
touring for nothing, how great.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after a friend who was a mechanic on an American
racing team invited her to come to America, O'Reilly got her green
card, packed up her massage table and headed across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went not knowing I had job, but I'd quit my job and wanted
to travel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After a year rooming with a racer's girlfriend in Boulder,
Colo., the Shaklee team offered her a job in 1995. The following
year the Postal Service team was formed, and recruited O'Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very lucky,'' she said. ``But I never really chased it, I
just liked to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly said that being in the minority at work is nothing new
to her, since she was the only women among 40 men at her
electrician's job. She shrugs and laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always get the dirty joke first; you know what I mean?'' she
said. ``Things like that . . . and they always laugh at me because
I shower so quick at home.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly said that even though she's treated equally at the race
by the other soigneurs (``They're grand''), it wasn't always that
way.
</P>
<P>
   When she started, marshalls at the finish line would ignore her
credential and push her away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would literally be lifted and dropped like 10 feet away,''
said the 5-foot-4-inch O'Reilly. ``But the other soigneurs would
come help, and say `leave her alone, she's with us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, whose job is kind of like a resident assistant's in a
dormitory, always keeps her door open so the riders can come in and
get water from the coolers in her room. So the key is always in the
door, until O'Reilly decides that it's lights-out, and time for
some privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's just pure survival mode, and I put the water
outside my door,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, is there to clean up ``the lads' scrapes,'' listen to
them talk about their day as they lay on the massage table, or
ignore them if they're talking on a cell phone the whole time. And
even if other teams look on O'Reilly as a curiousity, her team is
blase about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had women soigneurs on the national team and other teams,
so it's no big deal for us,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Emma's great; she takes good care of us,'' he said. ``If
we've might had bad day, she's there to cheer you up.''

FIRMS APPEAR TO BE READY FOR Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With just over five months to go before the crucial
test of Y2K computer readiness, New England institutions generally
have strong confidence that residents will be able to turn on the
lights, flush the toilet, and use the telephone and teller machine
come Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many officials are worried about what might
happen if too many people try to prove it to themselves at 12:01
a.m. and trigger a host of problems potentially as bad as anything
caused by technical malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   A Globe survey of Massachusetts utilities, hospitals, government
agencies, and other major institutions found that most say their
key computer systems are ready to handle the date changeover to
01/01/00.
</P>
<P>
   While a considerable number of smaller organizations _ such as
municipal governments, police departments, and local banks _ have
not upgraded their systems to handle Y2K issues, planners expect
these institutions will have enough time to finish and test their
remediation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Just how to make their optimism credible is still a matter of
controversy among regulators. But with the bulk of reviews
complete, officials say, they don't expect major technical
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can give 1,000 percent guarantees of anything,'' said
Cathy Minehan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
``But we're beginning to start feeling as confident about our
systems now as we want to be at the start of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hannon, top information systems officer for the city of
Boston, agreed. ``Clearly, the work that we've done has paid off,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal report earlier this month cited Boston and Dallas as
the only big-city governments in the United States where key
services were already prepared for the date change.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K, short for Year 2000, refers to a potential glitch in many
older computer systems that represent years as only two digits in a
code. When 99 becomes 00, some computers may be confused about what
year is intended and crash or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   With Y2K worries gradually easing, attention is shifting to
secondary issues, such as how to cope with the tendency to hoard
money and food as the end of the year approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is mainly one of public relations. Even curiosity
could be cause for concern: If a significant number of people turn
on lights and appliances or pick up their phones at 12:01 a.m. Jan.
1 just to see if they work, some service networks might not be able
to handle the extra load.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest national risk we have is overreaction from the
public,'' said John Koskinen, President Clinton's senior adviser on
Y2K matters. To ease worries, Koskinen has appeared at scores of
public forums around the country where public officials and
business leaders tout their progress.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-jitter efforts are also moving into high gear at companies
such as Bell Atlantic, which recently finished a $400 million-plus
Y2K repair job involving 11,000 components of its telephone
network, such as switches and call routers..
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is still a real human behavior issue,'' says Skip
Patterson, Bell Atlantic's top Y2K compliance official. ``If
everyone goes off hook at midnight to see if they are going to get
dial tone, they won't all get dial tone.''
</P>
<P>
   For economic reasons, the typical central office, serving 10,000
phone numbers, is designed to handle calls from only 20 percent at
a time, the typical maximum.
</P>
<P>
   A stampede to the telephone at the stroke of midnight could
cause many people to get fast busy signals, perhaps triggering
fears that the phone network has gone down or, in rare cases,
causing a collapse of telephone switching equipment.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the risk of a power surge from people turning on
lights and appliances at 12:01 a.m. Jan. 1 to make sure they still
work, New England power managers ``will have twice as much power
available as we would normally need on a cold Friday night in
December when businesses and offices are shut down,'' said Walter
Salvi, a Boston Edison spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a contingency our Y2K management team has anticipated,
and we are confident we can handle it'' by having power plants
warmed up to cover a demand spike, Salvi said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Water Resources Authority officials are also
optimistic on water and sewer service.
</P>
<P>
   Water to Greater Boston residents' taps is ``principally driven
by gravity, and there's no way that Y2K can screw that up,'' said
agency chief Douglas B. MacDonald. If all 1.9 million water
customers stockpiled 50 gallons in a bathtub the week before New
Year's Day, that would drain only 0.02 percent of the Quabbin
Reservoir's capacity.
</P>
<P>
   At the Deer Island sewage plant, the MWRA is installing $800,000
worth of emergency generators and will top them off with fuel in
late December to make sure the pumps that treat and move sewage
keep working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal Y2K strategy is to run our own (emergency)
generators through the night until we are confident the rest of the
electric system works'' and the MWRA can switch back to Boston
Edison for power, MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge remaining is to persuade the public to
accept the reassurances of electric and telephone utilities, said
Bell Atlantic's Patterson. ``We think that's basically our last
battle in this war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed's Minehan and other government officials have
applauded work by the private sector, regulators are facing growing
pressure to disclose more of what they know about firms that lag on
Y2K readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, the public hasn't been given good reason not to head
for the hills,'' Richard Torrenzano, a former spokesman for the New
York Stock Exchange, told bank regulators in a speech last month.
He proposed ``seals of approval'' for banks that have met
government standards.

   ``It would serve the public interest to know more'' about
preparations at individual companies, said Howard Rubin, a computer
science professor at Hunter College in New York and a Y2K
consultant to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to the airport, you get a list of what other
airports are dangerous to go to'' because of lax security, Rubin
said. ``This should be no different.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one major industry group is about to heed this advice.
The North American Electric Reliability Council, charged by the US
Energy Department with ensuring that the nation's electric grids
will continue to function through the date change, so far has
spoken of utility readiness only in generalities. But in a report
due Aug. 3, the council plans to disclose names of major
electric-power companies that met, or nearly met, a June 30
deadline to ready their systems.
</P>
<P>
   While the group will not single out failing companies, those
whose names do not appear on the two other lists can count on tough
questions from customers, shareholders, and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to release more detail is intended to increase
accountability and ease public worries about Y2K-triggered
blackouts, said Gary L. Neale, an Indiana power-company executive
who is chairman of the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten together and said if we don't start releasing
more information, then we'll never combat the fear factor,'' said
Neale.
</P>
<P>
   Said Michael Morris, head of Northeast Utilities in Berlin,
Conn.: ``You're never going to get people's confidence if you're
not going to let them see things. You can't just say, `Trust me.'
You've got to get a little deeper into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The reliability council's approach hasn't caught on in the
banking and financial services sector, another key area for Y2K
worries. So far, financial regulators have been willing to speak
only in broad terms about Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Citing federal rules, US officials won't specify which banks
they have found lacking, except for a handful of very small but
seriously troubled institutions. Of the 10,400 government-insured
banks in the country, only 2 percent, or about 200, missed recent
target dates to upgrade their systems, down from 357 in March, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You label somebody unsatisfactory, and they're labeled that
for eternity, when it doesn't mean they won't be ready for Y2K,
just that there are deficiencies in their program,'' FDIC spokesman
David Barr said. ``It's still solvable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the FDIC allow large banks like BankBoston Corp. to
disclose what grades they have received from federal examiners,
even if the grades are good and would bolster customers' confidence
their money will be accessible and properly tallied.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts banking commissioner, Thomas Curry, said the
downside of identifying laggards or allowing compliant banks to
tout their success is that doing so could destabilize otherwise
sound institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said two small Bay State banks missed a June 30 deadline
to make certain fixes, but he would not name them.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with the demand for extra cash, the Federal Reserve is
printing $50 billion of additional cash later this year, an amount
equal to $184 for every person in the United States. Officials
expect this extra currency will be enough to cover the needs of
bank customers who take out, say, a week's worth of cash to have on
hand in case their local ATM fails on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also say they have taken action against a handful of
small institutions, such as First Alliance Bank and Trust Co. in
Manchester, N.H., which for almost a year has been operating under
the terms of a federal order aimed at improving its operations.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance, which is the 14th largest of New Hampshire's 20
commercial banks, doesn't admit or deny allegations by regulators
last year that it had failed to prepare for Jan. 1, 2000, and
otherwise operated in ``an unsafe and unsound manner,'' according
to a First Alliance filing with the FDIC.
</P>
<P>
   But in accepting the order last September, the bank consented to
FDIC demands that it upgrade its computers, hire outside
consultants, and name a new top executive.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the bank has spent about $50,000 reviewing its
computers and putting its 18 employees to work on backup plans in
case its two ATMs crash. Now the bank plans to stock provisions
like extra bookkeeping pads and a manual typewriter to draw up
money orders, as well as plastic sheeting to cordon off office
space if a heating system fails.
</P>
<P>
   New chief executive Alan J. Cieto has also been telling scores
of the bank's largest clients about his efforts to make
improvements. None of his roughly 2,000 customers have closed
accounts as a result of Y2K worries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cieto wasn't required to disclose details of the federal review
to customers and in most cases hasn't done so, instead sending out
general letters summarizing the bank's remediation efforts. Several
of the bank's patrons said that they had heard of the deficiencies
only in broad terms, but that Cieto's communiques persuaded them
not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they're really on top of it,'' said Mark
Padfield, president of New Hampshire Blacktop Sealers Inc. in
Auburn. Beside, federal insurance should cover any losses that
might result from Y2K problems, he said. ``If something screws up,
they'll just be bought out, and I'll be paying my mortgage to
somebody else,'' Padfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials bet most people will wind up regarding Y2K as
does Padfield. An April Massachusetts Bankers Association poll of
200 people found 18 percent considered Y2K a serious problem, with
39 calling it a moderate problem and 31 percent saying it was
minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a hard core of people who think this is the
apocalypse,'' said Robert Fichter of the bankers group. But their
numbers will dwindle, he said. ``Most people will realize their
money's not going to disappear.''

RESTRAC RESURRECTS ITSELF VIA THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can find many things on the Internet, even an occasional
second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Restrac Inc., a Lexington, Mass. company that sold
high-tech systems for companies to automate and track their
recruiting operations. The stock went public with the usual hype in
the summer of 1996, took a terrible beating when it failed to meet
expectations for its very first quarter out and stayed down.
</P>
<P>
   Restrac was a ``fallen angel,'' in the parlance of investors who
buy small high-tech stocks. Once those angels fall, it is
notoriously difficult for them to get back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to June 1 this year when the company rechristened
itself as Webhire Inc., provider of ``end to end'' Internet
recruiting services.
</P>
<P>
   An even more important development occurred last week. Internet
super investor Softbank Capital Partners pumped $20 million into
the company and bought an existing 1.7 million share block for
about $10 million more to suddenly acquire a 40 percent interest in
the company.
</P>
<P>
   It was a glorious turn of events for shareholders who had stuck
through the brief but glum public life of Restrac/Webhire stock.
The shares, which could be purchased for 5 per share on June 1,
finished Tuesday at 14 1/8 and traded nearly a dollar higher than
that at its midsession peak.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest beneficiary of all was Softbank, which now owns
an interest in Webhire worth nearly double what it paid a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, there was nothing new about Webhire's operation or
its strategy. A shift of its product line toward Internet
applications had been gradually underway since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an overnight Internet success story just waiting
12 to 18 months to happen,'' said analyst Robert Austrian of
BancAmerica Securities. ``We finally got the match thrown in the
tinderbox.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift toward an Internet world, and the wide-eyed investor
expectations that go along with it, is a common event at
corporations doing all kinds of work. In businesses like Webhire
that focus on the management of information, you can move with the
Internet tide or, probably, drown.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those companies once known for whatever service they
provided to customers suddenly become defined for investors not by
the service but by the Web delivery system they adopt.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether those companies can use the Internet to
grow business to the degree suggested by hyperbolic Web-stock
valuations. Some will, but many others can't possibly make good on
the hope.
</P>
<P>
   One key to distinguishing the winners: whether the Web actually
expands the kinds of services a company offers to a broader base of
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Webhire began investing in Internet services shortly after its
stock crashed, when it was known as Restrac. The company spent more
money on research and development in 1997 than it had for the
previous seven years combined. Its stock price couldn't get much
worse, and Restrac began to record losses as a result of its
research and development investment.
</P>
<P>
   Webhire president Martin J. Fahey said the company was certain
its traditional business of automating resumes and recruiting
information on relatively expensive client-server computer hardware
would be affected by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But it also saw an opportunity to build a business that could
electronically sort through thousands of resumes posted on other
Internet sites for its corporate clientele, dramatically expanding
the pool of potential job candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Even better: though many Internet businesses had been built to
cater to job seekers of all kinds, there was practically no big
competition to serve the people who were doing the hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues with our company three or four years ago was
that we were a big fish and a small pond,'' said Fahey. ``When we
went public, the question was, `How big could your market possibly
be?' ''
</P>
<P>
   A booming economy and the very tight labor market that followed
made demand for a broader Webhire seem even more plausible.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're not all the way there, the things we thought would
happen definitely have,'' said Fahey. ``It's a rebirth in that
sense, something we're very proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't any rebirth in Webhire's financial numbers so
far. The company posted the widest quarterly losses in its public
history recently, and revenues have been down in year-ago
comparisons for three straight quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey said Webhire's weaker revenues are partly due to the
financial ups and downs of converting many existing customers to
Web-based systems, some of which are priced differently. His
argument: much of Webhire's new Internet-based revenues are a
recurring, annuity-style stream of cash that will be a big
long-term plus.
</P>
<P>
   Our question: Can Webhire live up to its suddenly explosive
stock price or will shareholders with big expecations be
disappointed again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that the expecations have become so radical,''
said analyst Austrian. It's more that there's suddenly a
recongition of great potential that is dramatically more likely to
be realized with Softbank as a partner.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Concertgoers at the Cape Cod Melody Tent in Hyannis
got a dose of musical nostalgia Saturday night as the Platters, the
Drifters, and the Coasters crooned soulful oldies, including
love-soaked tunes like ``The Magic Touch'' and ``Smoke Gets In Your
Eyes,'' that made the bands famous in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   On the same evening, Herb Reed and the Platters _ a group that
features Reed himself, the only surviving member of the original
Platters band _ performed at a nightclub in East Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement may seem unusual, but the practice is
commonplace at concert halls and musical venues across the country,
where numerous same-name knockoffs of other legendary oldies
groups, including the Supremes, the Spinners, and the Marvelettes,
can be found singing on stage virtually every day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But there seem to be more Platters out there than you would find
in an Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sahara casino in Las Vegas, for example, a band called
the Platters plays nightly, year-round. In Branson, Mo., another
group dubbed the Platters puts on about 200 shows annually.
</P>
<P>
   As the summer concert season swings into full gear, a
long-running debate over who has the legal authority to use the
names of the Platters and other famed oldies bands has emerged with
renewed vigor.
</P>
<P>
   To musicians like Reed, who founded the original Platters and
coined the group's name more than 45 years ago, the growing
prevalence of copycat bands _ many of whom pass themselves off as
originals _ amounts to blatant musical plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just raping my name and stealing my legacy,'' Reed,
who lives in Arlington, said in his gravelly baritone. ``It really
breaks your heart to see a group that calls itself the Platters
appearing here and there when you've never even met these people
and they have nothing to do with your success or your name.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, often due to poor business decisions made decades
ago, original band members have lost the right to use monikers they
coined in the 1950s and 1960s. Other aging singers, having failed
to trademark the names of groups they founded in their youth, now
find they have lost the rights to perform under those names.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has spawned dozens of legal battles nationwide between
original band members and so-called imposter bands. And it has
caused confusion among many music lovers, who often pay steep
ticket prices in anticipation of seeing original oldies groups,
only to hear imitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bands who are not the '50s and '60s recording stars
they're advertising themselves to be,'' said East Boston musician
Pat Benti, executive director of a nonprofit group called FAME,
which stands for Friends Against Musical Exploitation. ``To me,
it's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Musical purists won a legal victory in April, when a federal
appeals court issued a ruling in San Francisco that granted Reed
exclusive use of the ``Platters'' trademark. Similar litigation is
pending in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But many concert producers who routinely book copycat bands say
the issue is far from black and white, and insist that most
non-original groups are legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a group is licensed, has a trademark, and presents music in
fashion that is professional and consistent with the way this music
was originally recorded, then they are valid to perform before the
public,'' said Harvey Robbins, a Boston-area producer of oldies
concerts who calls the issue ``extremely, extremely complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are a renegade outfit with no license and no legal
claim to the name,'' added Robbins, who has debated the topic on
several talk-radio programs, ``then they can't and should not
appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of non-original bands also say any savvy consumer
should realize that few 1950s-era musical groups are likely to be
intact today. They also note that, unlike musicians of the 1980s
and 1990s whose individual identities are all-important _ such as
Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, or Rod Stewart _ bands of the 1950s and
1960s were known by name rather than by their members.
</P>
<P>
   And they point out that Reed's band isn't authentic, either,
since it includes only one founding member of the original group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, legislative efforts are under way to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Several musicians are working with a bipartisan group of Capitol
Hill legislators who have introduced the Truth in Rock Act, a bill
aimed at protecting the names of original oldies groups from being
appropriated by phonies.
</P>
<P>
   And in Massachusetts, consumer protection legislation has been
filed by state Representative Salvatore F. DiMasi, a North End
Democrat, to address the issue of consumers buying tickets to
concerts featuring performers who are not original band members.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, said Reed's lawyer, T. Christopher Donnelly, such
legislation should prevent imposter groups from ``riding the
coattails'' of original bands' success.

WASHINGTON HARVEST BRINGS JOBS HOUSING WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WENATCHEE, Wash. _ In a tangle of trees down by the Columbia
River, just past a sign advertising triple ripe cherries for sale,
64-year-old Gilberto Vallejo sleeps in the back of his red pickup
truck and envies Alberto Hernandez's accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, Hernandez, 50, has been sleeping, four men to a
tiny tent, beside the railroad tracks. The floor is no more than a
sheet of plastic, but at least he has access to water for washing
and bathrooms to stumble toward in the dark. Still, he wishes he
had Lourdes Alvarado's living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado, her husband and two sons have a spot in one of
Washington's choicer camps for cherry pickers. Among the amenities
in their tent _ larger than some studio apartments and provided
free by the orchard owner _ are a full-size refrigerator, ice
chest, and battery-operated lanterns. The floor is solid. There are
bunk beds with mattresses. Even so, Alvarado dreams of being able
to afford a motel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have hot water,'' exclaimed Alvarado, 50, wearing a
pink-and-white checkered apron as she prepared her ``spinach
special'' on the portable stove also provided by the orchard owner.
``It's better every year. It's better than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing _ no place to sleep, no place to cook, no place to wash
_ is what thousands of migrant workers found awaiting them when
they returned to Washington for this summer's cherry harvest. In a
dispute that everyone from federal overseers to state officials to
the pickers themselves say is tinged with irony, efforts to improve
the living conditions of migrant workers have led most of the
grower-run labor camps to close.
</P>
<P>
   Those camps, some little more than a collection of pup tents
pitched on bare ground, some far more elaborate than the camping
facilities in state parks, were all that many of the migrants who
make their way to Washington from California and Mexico each year
had to call home.
</P>
<P>
   But the state-licensed camps weren't enough to ease the housing
crisis that confronts agricultural workers everywhere. Neither did
they meet minimum federal standards for temporary worker housing.
So in May, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
ordered growers to upgrade or face sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have more and better camps unless you have
regulations and incentives,'' said Richard Terrill, OSHA's regional
director. ``If a camp by the river or a camp where workers bring
their own tents becomes an acceptable standard, that's all you will
ever have. This year saw some tough choices.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, all but a handful camps chose not to reopen, forcing
2,000 pickers into their vans or onto the riverbank come nightfall.
Like Ramon Gomez, 40, who has been sleeping in a state park, they
joined the thousands of other migrants who never had housing in the
first place. An estimated 16,000 to 30,000 workers pick Washington
cherries each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'd prefer to live somewhere with a bathroom,
someplace where I could wash up after work,'' said Gomez, who
follows the cherry harvest in an old tan-and-white van shared by a
half-dozen friends. ``But we couldn't get into a camp. There never
were a lot of places to stay and now there are none.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at its 1997 peak, only a minuscule fraction of the cherry
orchards _ 32 out of 1,800 _ participated in the state's pilot
housing program, said Maria Gardipee, who oversees agricultural
employee programs at the state Department of Health. This year, the
number of licensed camps fell to eight _ all of them relying on
tents the state had made to meet federal standards and is now
renting out for $200 a month. But there are only 29 tents, far too
few to meet worker demand. The state hopes to have more on hand
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The clash between OSHA, which sets standards for migrant farm
worker housing, and the state, which runs the licensing program,
centers on living conditions that are modest by most measures. The
agencies agree orchard owners should provide drinking water,
bathrooms and showers. But federal rules also require six-person
tents tall enough to stand in, with screened ventilation, floors,
cots and electrical connections.
</P>
<P>
   The hitch: the state allowed workers to bring their own tents
and to pile in as many people as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Worker advocates and others ``are saying unless they can have
everything they want, they'd rather have nothing for the migrant
workers,'' said Michael Gempler, head of the Washington Growers
League in Yakima. ``That's unfortunate, because the migrant workers
are the ones who are suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The cherry-picking season is short, running from about June 1 to
Aug. 1, and labor intensive, with pickers pouring into the orchards
before dawn and ending their day when the thermometer hits 80
degrees _ the temperature at which the cherries begin to bruise and
their stems fall off. An orchard can be picked clean in a week or
sooner, so workers keep moving south to north as the weather warms
and the crops ripen.
</P>
<P>
   Others have made cities such as Wenatchee their homes, staying
year-round to prune the cherry, apple, peach and pear trees, and to
pack the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet cherries are a $125 million to $150 million a year
industry, and workers are paid by the box. The quickest among them
can earn as much as $80 a day; others barely break the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United Farm Workers union has sided with OSHA, saying
the state has made strides toward improving conditions, but that it
had already given growers too much time to provide their employees
with the basics and was about to give them even more. Now the union
wants the state to declare a state of emergency and call in the
National Guard to erect safe and sanitary tent camps similar to the
ones set up in Albania for Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state had always used the excuse that the licensing
program was temporary and the philosophy was it's better than
nothing, and that's what we ended up with,'' said Guadalupe Gamboa,
Washington state director of the union, which does not formally
represent the workers. ``We saw what the state wanted as the
implementation and sanction of Third World living standards.''
</P>
<P>
   But Governor Gary Locke always saw the current standards as the
short-term component in a long-term housing plan, said spokesman
David Chai. This year, he said, the state approved measures that
would create permanent housing for 10,000 workers in the next
decade. It also opened the first state-financed housing development
for migrants and added additional camp inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Dorsing Farms in Royal City spent $125,000 to
build a camp for the scores of workers needed to pick its 150 acres
of sweet cherries. It installed a pumice block shower, toilets,
sinks, and clothes-washing basins. It added barbecue pits, picnic
tables, and lights along the trails. Tents, however, were not
included, a violation of federal standards. Now the camp is open
only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Workers can wash up, but must sleep
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year there were a few more camps, but then the
controversy started and really shot down the program,'' said Kevin
Dorsing, the third generation of his family to farm cherries.
``Growers got gun shy of lawsuits or fines. . . . It's a real cost
to put up these facilities, especially for new growers or small
growers, and to have to provide tents on top of that is even
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing somewhere to sleep and eat, of course, is not pure
altruism on the part of orchard owners. Many of Washington's 21,000
acres of sweet cherries are located a half-hour drive or more from
any town. Growers want their pickers in the orchards early. They
want them healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Wenatchee orchards at which Lourdes Alvarado and her family
work are on what locals call ``the hill.'' The owner, Stemilt
Growers, has had a camp there since the 1950s and has provided
workers with tents since the early 1990s. This year, it is renting
12 from the state and is waiting for three. In the interim, Stemilt
is using six of its old tents and, in essence, daring to be fined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're willing to be the test . . .,'' said Jan
Mathison, whose husband's family started Stemilt. ``It's all kind
of ridiculous. We've had to turn people away because we don't have
room for them.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials say they hope to work out standards
that are acceptable to all sides before the next cherry crop comes
in. Otherwise, as Alberto Hernandez put it, the owner-operated but
apparently illegal roadside camp where he is staying will not be
improved. It will be closed.

   BOSTON -- It will be two years ago this week that William of
Weld waved his figurative sword in lordly fashion at the State

a team in place, and a head start on reelection.

   Lots can happen in two years. That's the gestation period for a

long enough to form a judgment about the quality and merit of an
administration that was reelected (by a margin of 3 percent) nine
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just my opinion _ no, it's also the opinion of a lot of other
people who expect a high-caliber performance from a Massachusetts
governor _ that Cellucci presides over the most lackluster Corner
Office clique since the four-year interregnum of Ed King injected a
speed bump in the 12 years cumulative of the Dukakis era. This is
not about style or ideology; it's about competence, character, and
delivering the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is a populist proletarian where Weld was a proud
plutocrat. Cellucci is popular with people, press, and politicians;
his poll numbers are pleasing, prosperity anesthetizes the
citizenry. Lots of people say he's a nice man. But in terms of
leadership, programs, government innovation, and crispness in
administering, he's a small-time guy in a big-time job. Governor
Smallbore.
</P>
<P>
   If a politician's choices are lead, follow, or get out of the
way, it's now pretty apparent that Cellucci is a get-out-of-the-way
guy. A longtime State House figure who knows him, likes him, voted
for him, and works for him admits: ``I don't know what he's doing,
what he stands for. There's nothing going on. No one seems to
understand it, either. The regulars up here, both parties, are
confused by the vacuum. It's a stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   We now know what Cellucci likes: to cut ribbons, go on trade
missions, muse upon what fun it'll be for his friend George W. Bush
to be president, and go home to Hudson, rent a video, microwave the
popcorn. When it comes to the heavy lifting of government, alas,
this governor is AWOL. He's Governor Bystander.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots were on the verge of moving to Hartford, he
was not even a factor. The Pats came slinking back into town, at
gunpoint, under the itchy trigger-finger of NFL owners who didn't
want to make the Krafts richer while their take got skimmed by
losing TV revenue from Boston's bigger market. Cellucci had nothing
to do with their going or coming.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the state minimum wage? Cellucci rode along for the ride
on that too. The state budget? There's a laugh. House experts like
Paul Haley, chairman of Ways and Means, hoot at his arithmetic. The
deals will all be cut by Speaker Tom Finneran and Senate President
Tom Birmingham, each of whom can roll over the tiny band of
Republicans in their midst any time they want.
</P>
<P>
   The talent level has fallen off dramatically since Weld loped
onstage with libertarian brio, demanding tax cuts, the heads of
dead criminals, a walrus slaughter to decimate the state payroll,
and leaner-meaner gummint all round. Weld delivered on the first
and last; he got his tax cuts and leaner-meaner.
</P>
<P>
   But the walruses turned into Weld-Cellucci lapdogs. The death
penalty never happened, despite annual charades involving the
relatives of slain cops and lectern-pounding over the timeliest
local atrocity. Then the Weld appointees, some of them but by no
means all first-rate, began slip-sliding away. The thrill was to be
with Bill; with Paul set in the pall.
</P>
<P>
   Nine long years into the Weld-Cellucci thing, the cupboard is
bare. Tired, spent, agenda-poor, and patronage-rich, the
Cellucci-Swift operation is anything but swift of foot or nimble of
brainpower. I'm not saying they're all dopes and mopes and
second-raters. Andrew Natsios, a brainy former state rep with
top-shelf international aid credentials, is worth the benefit of
the doubt as budget overseer. But we're talking Pawtucket or worse
when you go down the rest of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The self-professed ``education governor'' names as chief of the
higher education system Steve Tocco? A
pharmacist-turned-bureaucrat-turned-lobbyist? To summon the deities
of academe in the land of Horace Mann and James Conant? Of Boston
Latin and Harvard and MIT? I swallowed John Silber, Bill Bulger,
and Jim Carlin, tough-guy Democrats all, when Weld gambled on their
potential for juicing education. Each made solid contributions. But
Steve Tocco?
</P>
<P>
   Governor Law-and-order in the campaign mode was four-square
against crime. But Governor Tax-cut has presided over the shrinkage
of the State Police from 2,416 four years ago to 2,171 now, a
downsizing of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   We've all chortled over the fiasco of Governor Back-hoe making a
big deal of demolishing turnpike toll booths for the benefit of his
reelection, then raising tolls when the heat was off. And his
plundering of the political system for campaign contributions
reached into the National Guard, where he had to fire his Guard
commander for hocus-pocus involving the euchring of campaign money
for Cellucci's reelection. Before that, out went the
underperforming Registrar of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Since Weld quit, of the first 34 judges Cellucci nominated, not
one of them came from an Ivy League law school. Hmmm. Seven flunked
the bar exam on their first try. Double-hmmm. And eight held
political jobs. Triple-hmmm. Nineteen of the first 34 are
Democrats, suggesting Cellucci is still paying off the renegades
who left their party to endorse him last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dig? Don't ask; it'll top out at $15 billion and beggar
the state road-and-bridge budget for a decade more. The new runway
for Logan? Cellucci's Big Business buddies want it, but the Guv
can't deliver. The business crowd now sees Cellucci as a marginal
player when big things get decided. Governor Nice Guy to his pals
on Beacon Hill is Governor No-show when it comes to delivering the
goods. Three more years.

CHANGE IN PENSION PLAN STIRS UNION TALK AT IBM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of his 18-year career at IBM, test engineer John Mendes
of Burlington, Vt., never thought about joining a union. After all,
Big Blue paid well, its benefits were generous, and it was the
world's top computer company.
</P>
<P>
   But six years after IBM introduced a cost-cutting program to
stem losses, Mendes has joined a group of mostly midcareer
manufacturing and professional workers who are determined to bring
in a union.
</P>
<P>
   The root of their rebellion is a change in the IBM pension plan.
The old plan, in place for decades, promised employees a
predictable monthly check upon retirement based on years of service
_ a traditional ``defined benefits'' pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, IBM on July 1 began setting up retirement
accounts for each of its 140,000 employees in the United States,
and posting to those accounts a fixed amount of money each month,
based on each employee's salary or wage.
</P>
<P>
   These deposits will accumulate interest over time. The program
is called a ``cash balance'' plan, and it follows a model now used
by 12 percent of US corporations _ double the number of companies
five years ago _ as they seek ways to deal with a tight labor
market and an increasingly mobile work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are really angry about the changes. They feel
betrayed,'' said Mendes, 41, who holds an engineering degree from
the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Notified in May about the change, employees at the company's
plants in Essex Junction, Vt., and at Poughkeepsie, East Fishkill
and Endicott, N.Y., contacted the 630,000-member Communications
Workers of America, which responded by holding organizing sessions
with IBM workers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, union leaders and labor specialists are
watching this movement closely. Any union success at IBM would be a
significant inroad into the high technology industry, where
employees have long shunned collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Prounion employees say the IBM pension changes penalize
midcareer employees _ about 40 percent of IBM's US work force _
while rewarding about the same number of newer workers, most of
them hired since 1993, when IBM chief executive Louis V. Gerstner
instituted a sweeping series of cost-cutting moves.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, IBM says the old pension plan is not being closed
out and will continue to pay previously scheduled benefits to
people already retired and to those employees within five years of
retirement _ about 20 percent of the giant's US work force.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the new plan will help it attract and keep the
best talent in the high-tech marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that significantly fewer people are staying with one
company their full careers means that, more and more, people are
looking for opportunities to contribute and be rewarded sooner in
their careers,'' IBM said in a letter to workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not reducing the total amount of money we spend in
benefits,'' IBM spokeswoman Jana Weatherbee said. ``We are shifting
or changing how we spend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put a lot of money into our pension plan, but when you
look at the marketplace, the traditional defined benefit plan is
not what our competitors are offering.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM says it spends $3.5 billion annually on benefits in the
United States. The change to a cash-balance pension plan is
expected to save $200 million, which will be shifted to
performance-based compensation programs such as stock options and
variable salary increases, IBM said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also has, in addition to the other plans, a 401(k)
retirement program to which employees can make contributions, some
of which the company matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional pension plans take a lot of money and basically
give it to the career employee who eventually retires, but it gives
little to those who come and go early in their careers,'' according
to Michael Johnston of Hewitt Associates, a benefits consultancy
based in Lincolnshire, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Defined-benefit plans ``throw the money to those in the back-end
of their career,'' Johnston said. Cash balance plans are
``egalitarian,'' he argues. These plans ``say, `You're here for
five years, when you go we will still reward you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the plans have been criticized for eliminating the
boosts in compensation older employees in traditional plans receive
near the end of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   That's why IBM computer programmer Ginny Roarabaugh, 48, of
Austin, Texas, was upset about the change. In May, she launched a
Web site for workers around the country who want to know more about
the current union drive.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said workers who are 40 or older, or whose age
plus years of service equal 50, may qualify for extra pay
``credits'' and a higher payment into their monthly cash balance
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But Roarabaugh contends that even with those changes, the switch
will cost her money. She had planned to retire at 55.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this new plan, I won't have the same income when I
retire,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``The way things used
to work, the more time you had in the company the more points you
got, and you got a big bang in your retirement during the last five
years. Under the old plan, I would have had $2,200 per month until
I die _ way more than a cash plan that will give me a lump sum
payment of cash in the $90,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a cash balance plan, being younger is better,'' said Lee
Conrad, a 49-year-old machine operator at IBM's Endicott, N.Y.,
plant who has twice tried, unsuccessfully, to organize a union at
the company. ``If you're young you can build (the plan) up over
time. Older people, middle-aged people don't have that kind of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Midcareer workers are not the only ones who don't like the
change. US Representative Bernard Sanders, an Independent from
Vermont, says he plans to hold a ``town meeting'' in Burlington
soon to air IBM workers' concerns. On July 13, Sanders and 10
Congress members sent a letter to the Internal Revenue Service
asking that it cease authorizing company proposals to switch to
cash balance accounts pending an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS should not sign off on the IBM plan until a thorough
investigation has been done to determine if there was age
discrimination,'' said Sanders. ``There are people who had the
option of remaining in the old plan, but there are many others who
are not within five years of retirement who will see a 30 percent
reduction in their retirement. These are people who were loyal to
the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Weatherbee defended the change. ``We would not have put a
plan into place that violates the law,'' she said. ``Midcareer
people have a transition benefit and an enhanced annuity to bridge
them into the new plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people are hearing is more rhetoric than anything
else,'' said Phil Rueppel, an analyst at Deutche Bank Alex. Brown
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk of unionization in high tech has been around for
awhile and it has been largely unsuccessful. Right now, companies
are having to offer very attractive packages to keep employees. If
they don't, it is very easy to get jobs at another firm. Given
that, it is difficult for a union to find a lever to gain
acceptance. I would be very surprised if this effort led to a major
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, any attempt to unionize Big Blue will be an uphill
battle. Although its plants in Europe are unionized, IBM's North
American work force historically has given unions the cold
shoulder. Conrad, who led organizing efforts in the 1970s and
1980s, said: ``Paternalism was in high gear at the company then,
and IBM was the only game in town. We were looked down on as
dissatisfied workers.''
</P>
<P>
   But this organizing drive could be different. ``Unions have
tried to organize IBM in the past, but if you stood up for a union
at IBM 10 years ago, you were considered a spoiler,'' said Cornell
University labor professor Kate Bronfenbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the push to unionize is coming from inside. People feel
they had an implied contract, but it has been broken. I really
believe this will have a snowball affect,'' she said.

DVIDENDS OF A HOSTILE TAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the two seasons in which two professional women's
basketball leagues co-existed, it didn't take long for each to
assume a clearly defined identity.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA: superior financial backing, tremendous media exposure, and
savvy public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ABL: smaller markets, lack of national exposure, but deeper and
better talent.
</P>
<P>
   A common criticism _ that the level of play in each league was
diluted thanks to the other's existence _ was rendered moot when
the ABL declared bankruptcy and folded last December, enabling the
WNBA to absorb many of the former league's players.
</P>
<P>
   As the WNBA moves into the final one-third of its regular
season, several ABL players have assumed dominant roles in the
WNBA, including the following All-Stars:
</P>
<P>
   --Yolanda Griffith has made a profound impact in Sacramento. The
6-foot-3-inch Griffith, whose 13 double-doubles are best in the
league, ranks second to Houston's Cynthia Cooper in scoring with
20.2 points per game and leads in rebounding (12.3). A Most
Valuable Player award may not be far away.
</P>
<P>
   --Utah's Natalie Williams, a former ABL MVP and scoring
champion, is third in scoring (19.3) and second in rebounding (9).
At 6-2, the daughter of former NBA guard Nate Williams is, like
Griffith, a prototype power forward.
</P>
<P>
   --Tonya Edwards and Shannon ``Pee Wee'' Johnson, last season's
backcourt for the Columbus Quest, haven't let up in their new
homes. Edwards is averaging 16.4 points a game for Minnesota and is
fifth in the WNBA in 3-pointers made, while the 5-7 Johnson's 13.8
points, 5.2 assists, and league-leading 36.7 minutes per game have
given a boost to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   --Orlando's Taj McWilliams is the rare center who can mix it up
inside but who can also drift outside and hit 3-pointers
consistently; she's 6-2 but has made 50 percent of her long-range
shots to rank second in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL is represented on each WNBA team, but nowhere has the
old league manifested itself more grandly than in Minnesota and
Orlando. The two expansion teams were allowed to keep five former
ABL players, while the eight existing teams were limited to three.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynx, in the playoff hunt, are a WNBA version of Columbus;
their five ABL veterans are all former Quest players. Not
coincidentally, Minnesota's coach is Brian Agler, who led the Quest
to the ABL's only two championships.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, McWilliams, and rookie Nykesha Sales of Connecticut
have helped keep the Miracle in playoff contention. The ``Cool
Keesh'' signs sprouting in the O-rena lend testimony to the impact
and popularity of Sales; her 14.5 points per game lead the team.
</P>
<P>
   A lingering lack of name recognition may explain why no former
ABL players were elected by fans to start in the All-Star Game,
though six were chosen as reserves (Washington's Nikki McCray, who
jumped to the WNBA a season ago, was the other former ABL
All-Star).
</P>
<P>
   Considering that New York's Rebecca Lobo, out for the year after
tearing an anterior cruciate ligament in the season's first game,
was selected to start lends credence to the theory that All-Star
voting in any sport is little more than a game of popularity and
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Magnificent Monarchs
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most dramatic impact of the ABL on existing WNBA
teams has come in Sacramento, where the Monarchs have become the
league's most-improved team. ABL refugee Kedra Holland-Corn (13
pgg) has joined Griffith in resucitating Sacramento, which is tied
for the league's third-best record at 13-7, already has far
surpassed last season's win total of eight and gained additional
credibility by handing defending champ Houston one of its four
defeats. The Monarchs, the league's second-highest scoring team a
year after being the worst, also have benefited from the return of
Ruthie Bolton-Holifield, out nearly all of last season with a torn
ACL, and the maturation of second-year point guard Ticha
Penachiero, the league's assist leader at 7.3 per game. Former
Maine star Cindy Blodgett has seen little action, averaging 3.6
minutes and 1.1 points in eight games . . . Is it the WNBA or the
WBA? A brawl last Friday between Detroit and Cleveland led to five
suspensions and/or fines, including one to Detroit's Dominique
Canty for throwing a ``connecting punch.'' A few days earlier, it
was quite a sight when Phoenix's Debbie Black, a 5-2 guard, got
into a scuffle with 6-3 Venus Lacy of New York . . . Lin Dunn, a
former ABL Coach of the Year with Portland, has been named
coach/general manager of the expansion Seattle franchise.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Critics who dismiss sports as having no relation to real life
can take both vindication and pause from the latest project of
Northeastern Univerity's Center for the Study of Sport in Society.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of diversity, there is indeed no comparison _ the world
of fun and games far outpaces society in general. But there is
still much room for improvement in professional and college
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   That is the conclusion of the NU center's 10th annual Racial and
Gender Report Card, which covers 1998 and rates what it considers
the three major professional sports organizations _ the National
Football League, National Basketball Association, and Major League
Baseball _ as well as NCAA Division 1 schools. In addition, the
National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, and the Women's NBA
(as well as the defunct American Basketball League) were examined,
though no grades were issued because this was the first extensive
study of those enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Using as its barometer the federal affirmative action policy
that the makeup of the workplace should reflect that of the general
population _ which is approximately 12 percent black _ the NU study
graded the leagues accordingly: A (at least 24 percent minority), B
(12 percent), C (9 percent), D (6 percent), and F (5 percent). In
addition, grades regarding the inclusion of women were issued for
the first time and the entire report was released on the Internet
(www.nuway.neu.edu/sport).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the NBA received an A-minus, the NFL a B-plus, and
Major League Baseball a B for racial diversity. Gender was another
matter: Only the NBA was rated highly (B), while the NFL received a
D-plus and MLB did not supply sufficient data.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of player opportunities, the Big Three went to the head
of the class _ the NBA and NFL got A-pluses, MLB an A.
</P>
<P>
   But positions of authority remain problematic as pro sports,
with the exception of the NBA, have done little to alter the
perception that there is an artificial ceiling for minorities and
women. The NBA got an A-plus/B-minus for its league office minority
staffing (22 percent), a B-plus for head coaches (17 percent), an A
for principals in charge (general managers or their equivalent; 24
percent), and a B for senior administration (directors,
coordinators, managers; 14 percent). Regarding gender, its league
office received a B-plus (45 percent), senior administration a B
(41 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In the league office, the NFL earned a B-plus for minorities (21
percent) but a D for gender (26 percent). For minority head
coaches, it got a C-plus (10 percent), and its front-office grade
was B (13 percent). While its senior administration graded out to a
B (12 percent), the NFL was lacking in gender diversity at that
level, posting a D-minus (27 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that the progress we have made is being
recognized,'' said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello. ``We also understand
we have more progress to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball received a B-plus for its central office in terms of
minorities (21 percent) but a C-minus for gender (34 percent). Its
managerial rating was a solid B (13 percent), but it flunked the
front-office category (0 percent) and did not provide the necessary
information for ranking its senior administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an area in which Major League Baseball works very hard,''
said spokesman Rich Levin. ``It's an area in which we're going to
continue to work very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the study found that the increase in off-field
opportunities for women far surpassed those for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   At the college level, NCAA headquarters _ which are in the
process of relocating from Overland Park, Kan., to Indianapolis _
scored highly in both race (B-plus; 20.5 percent) and gender
(A-minus; 49 percent). But individually, its members did not make
the grade. Head coaching rated only a D-plus (7.8 percent) for both
men's and women's teams, though the opportunities for women coaches
were considerably higher (B; 43.7 percent). And athletic directors'
jobs were almost exclusively a white male domain as the Division 1
schools got Fs in race (4.6 percent) and gender (8.2 percent).
Opportunities for student athletes _ A in race (32 percent),
B-minus in gender (39 percent) _ helped raise the overall college
marks to C in race and gender.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Laronica Conway said no one from the NCAA hierarchy
had seen the report or was currently in position to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colleges have been kind of operating on the moral
imperative _ they think it's the right way to go, to hire more
minorities and women,'' said Richard Lapchick, the NU center's
director and the study's author. ``The pros years ago realized that
it's also a business imperative, that it's right for business to
reflect globalization, not just the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the men's pro leagues, the NHL led the way in women among
non-senior professional administrators at 45 percent. MLS was first
for minorities in both senior (20 percent) and non-senior (22
percent) administrators.
</P>
<P>
   In all the men's pro leagues, only two teams (MLB's Seattle
Mariners and the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning) are owned by minorities
and only three (the NFL's St. Louis Rams and San Francisco 49ers,
MLB's Cincinnati Reds) by women.
</P>
<P>
   One myth shattered is that the number of black athletes at the
pro and college level continues to rise; in fact, the opposite is
true _ MLB (15 percent) has its lowest black participation in a
decade, while the NBA (77 percent) and NFL (65 percent) ratios are
the lowest since 1992-93. Lapchick considers the major reason for
this decrease the globalization of sports, citing as an example the
fact that the number of Latinos playing major league baseball _ 25
percent _ is at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing, the study reveals that so-called position
stacking _ de facto segregation of what it calls ``thinking and
control'' positions _ continues. In the NFL, 9 percent of
quarterbacks were black; in baseball, the ratio was worse _ 5
percent of pitchers, 4 percent of catchers. And in the three major
pro sports graded in the report, there were only 11 minority
managers or head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, says the report, is that ``too few (management
positions) are filled by minorities or women.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also points out that ``even those sports where grades are
low generally have better records on race and gender than society
as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the study indicates that the situation for minorities
and women in sports is better _ but not nearly as good as it should
be.

SOME MOVIE MAKERS DON'T WANT TO RISK FRIGHT OVER DATE PROBLEM  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warner Bros. has canceled plans for a movie called ``Y2K,'' a
decision its producer says reflects a lack of faith in audiences to
tell the difference between fictional and real-world computer
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they don't even want to talk about Y2K,'' said Bing
Howenstein, president of George Street Pictures, the production
company behind the film, which was to have featured Chris
O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. won't discuss the reasons behind its decision, but
it is not the first time material depicting Y2K problems has
sparked controversy. Last month, Polaroid Corp. agreed to pull a
television ad after bankers complained its portrayal of Y2K-related
glitches in an automatic teller machine might lead to unwarranted
fears about the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the public would be better off if it were easier to
imagine _ and poke fun at _ bad-news scenarios. By quashing films
and ads, ``we're keeping people in the dark, and it's something
that will contribute to social fragility if the worst comes,'' says
Richard Landes, a Boston University historian who studies public
reactions to the millennial change.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, O'Donnell was to star as a computer programmer who
discovered a Y2K-related computer bug that could leave New York
City security systems vulnerable to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   At least one critic on a United Nations panel reviewing Y2K
preparedness had criticized the movie as too provocative, a charge
that Howenstein counters by noting he worked on the script with
Toronto-based software consultant Peter de Jager, a widely quoted
specialist on preparing for the date change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The script I saw was totally nonvolatile, and I had no
objection,'' de Jager said. ``And I'm very sensitive to the whole
issue of stirring things up.''

S.F. POLICE CAPTAIN EYES RUN FOR MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco police Capt. Richard Cairns, whose
role in the 1989 police sweep of a high-crime area of the city
resulted in his suspension from the force, has picked up papers
declaring his intent to run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The move allows Cairns to raise money and explore a run for the
mayor's job without formally entering the mayor's race. ``I am
still debating (whether to run or not),'' he said in an interview,
``but I'm 90 percent sure I will run for mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Cairns has until Aug. 6 to officially enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five people have declared their intent to run, including
current Mayor Willie Brown, Supervisor Tom Ammiano, former Mayor
Frank Jordan and political consultant Clint Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in San Francisco, Cairns is a 30-year, highly
decorated veteran of the police force. He was mentioned as a
possible choice for police chief early in Brown's administration,
but that post went to then Deputy Police Chief Fred Lau. Cairns
also was mentioned as a possible member of the command staff, but
did not get that promotion, either. Currently, he is the captain in
charge of the Treasure Island station.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns said his being overlooked for a promotion earlier had
nothing to do with him considering a run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The police captain said he had been thinking about a run for
``quite a while'' and has been encouraged by friends and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what prompted me to was seeing politicians setting up to
run but not really wanting to run, and people who want to see
change but not wanting to make the changes,'' he said. ``The
professional politicians are not fixing the city. I'm an ordinary
kind of person. I relate to people. Maybe, it's time for an
ordinary person to make the city work.''
</P>
<P>
   If he runs, Cairns may have to overcome criticizm from the some
members of the gay and lesbian community for his role in the Oct.
6, 1989, police sweep of Castro Street, a high-crime area. Cairns,
who was head of the police tactical unit at the time, was given a
45-day suspension for striking protesters and ordering a false
arrest during an AIDS demonstration in the Castro District.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was 10 years ago,'' said Cairns. ``It's behind me. I was
disciplined for whatever. I'm not going to debate the pros and cons
of that issue. ... Except that one issue, I've not had any problems
with any community.''
</P>
<P>
   During the incident, police arrested 50 people after shutting
down part of Castro Street to cars and pedestrians. People in the
area, not all of them demonstrators, were herded down the street
and prohibited from leaving stores and businesses for nearly 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns said he's since talked to gay and lesbian groups.
</P>
<P>
   If he runs for mayor, Cairns will have to take a leave of
absence from his police job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take a leave,'' he said. ``That's not a problem. On Nov.
2, I'll be back to work or going over to City Hall one or the
other.''

IT IS TIME WE ALL LET LEWIS REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, a woman woke up and decided that she didn't
feel like talking on the phone. A couple of her best friends called
more than once before their messages were returned. The
conversations were brief. The friends understood.
</P>
<P>
   You've been there, right? Those are the days when you are
thanking the technological gods for annoyance prevention, which is
also known as Caller ID. Sometimes it feels good to shut out the
world, free from any outside nonsense. But here's the biggest thing
that separates most of us from that 34-year-old woman, Donna
Harris-Lewis: Whether she answers the phone or not, the chattering
continues. She has had to hear it _ either whispered or screamed _
for six straight years. Her emotions are raw and unsettled. Her
peace comes in fragments.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think she should have to live this way anymore, even
though I understand why she does.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago this Tuesday (July 27), Reggie Lewis left his
house in the afternoon to go play basketball. His wife remembers
all the details from that day in 1993. She was pregnant. It was 75
degrees, windy and rainy in Boston. The Red Sox had just had their
10-game winning streak snapped by the Brewers. Chris Corchiani was
trying to make it with the Celtics. And Lewis, the Celtics'
captain, never returned home. July 27 was the day he died on a
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)There is no evidence that he has any form of
cardiomyopathy or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias . . . I
have rendered a medical judgment and I have advised him of what
that judgment is . . .(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   She still remembers those quotes from her husband's
cardiologist, Gilbert Mudge. Those quotes were not accurate. Lewis
did have a life-threatening heart condition, just as New England
Baptist Hospital doctor Mark Josephson said he did. A Suffolk
Superior Court jury saw those facts clearly _ and still failed to
say, overwhelmingly, that Mudge was at fault for Lewis's death.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, those are the facts we have about the death of
Lewis. Unless you believe in some intricate conspiracy, the facts
are also that Reggie Lewis did not use cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   It seems strange to say that now in New England, even though the
opposite should be true. There isn't anyone in the region who can
prove that Lewis was so attached to coke that it scarred his heart
and eventually snuffed out his life. There are whispers. There are
anonymous quotes. There are shady characters who say they did the
drug with him, but can't remember where. There are those who say
they did, retract their claims and then demand money for additional
stories. There is no proof.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I don't blame Harris-Lewis for chasing down
every accusation and correcting every false story. Earlier this
month, she faxed and e-mailed a letter to Sports Illustrated
because the magazine contained a news brief about Lewis that
``reeked of malice and a reckless disregard for the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might see Harris-Lewis's behavior as obsessive. Some
Celtics fans talk about her in the same disdainful context that
John Lennon fans talk about Yoko Ono. Her deeply personal choices _
such as her decision not to get her late husband a headstone _ are
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, I am still amazed by some of our audacity. As
sports fans, we are used to criticizing those who can't make
15-footers or throw strikes. But who the hell are we to criticize
someone for the way they grieve? In a recent tragedy, the Kennedy
and Bessette families tossed the remains of their loved ones in the
Atlantic. It was their choice. Harris-Lewis does not have a
headstone for her husband. Her choice.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Harris-Lewis and her attorneys did not make the best
decision by inviting the shockingly arrogant Arn Tellem to be an
expert witness for them in court. But that is no reason to dismiss
the fact that a cardiologist said Lewis had a normally functioning
heart when, in fact, he did not.
</P>
<P>
   It can be painful when cold facts intersect with incomplete
grieving. If you have ever lost your best friend suddenly, you can
begin to understand how Harris-Lewis feels. If you have ever been a
wife who waited for your husband to come home and he never did, you
can begin to understand how she feels. If you have ever had someone
try to remix your husband's memory . . . well, then you know what
it's like six years after a funeral, avoiding the phone and
remembering exactly where you were and what you were thinking when
it happened.
</P>
<P>
   She should not have to live this way anymore. There is no proof
that her husband did cocaine. There is proof that he was in Roxbury
on Thanksgiving mornings, handing out turkeys. There is proof that,
in 1992, the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Celtics in an Eastern
Conference semifinal series, even though they had no way of
stopping Lewis. There is proof _ through the paintbrushes and spray
cans of graffiti artists who have put up murals _ of his impact and
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now we can let Lewis finally have his peace. And his widow
have hers, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- To chart progress in the battery wars, a score card of
TV ads may be helpful. Let's see. Rayovac has Michael Jordan.
Energizer has a memorable bunny. And Duracell? The battery maker
now owned by Gillette Co. has neither pitchman nor pitch-beast.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. What Duracell does have is some of its biggest leads
ever over Energizer, mostly as a result of applying the same
strategies to batteries that Gillette uses so well to sell razors.
</P>
<P>
   A year after Duracell debuted the Ultra, the battery equivalent
of Gillette's much ballyhooed Mach3 razor, number one Duracell is
opening a wide gap over number two Energizer, which is also being
hurt by number three Rayovac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're winning,'' says Edward Jones analyst Tony
Vento of Duracell and its big lead in US market share.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if current trends hold up, Gillette's battery sales may
some day eclipse razor sales. Razors accounted for about 30 percent
of overall 1998 sales of just over $10 billion, batteries for about
25 percent, or $2.58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the popularity of digital cameras, Palm Pilots,
and cell phones, the $12 billion worldwide market for general
purpose batteries is growing far faster than the $7 billion
wet-shaving market.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette already dominates the shaving market, which includes
gels and shaving cream, with about a 70 percent share. Duracell
owns about less than half, so batteries offer Gillette a big growth
opportunity. (With much higher profit margins than batteries,
though, razors should continue to be the biggest component of
Gillette's earnings.)
</P>
<P>
   The battery war is hardly over. At the moment, Duracell seems to
be sacrificing profits for market share. Heavy spending on ads and
promotions were the reason for ``notably lower'' second-quarter
operating profits for Duracell, according to Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   As Gillette continues to be hurt by ailing economies in key
foreign markets, the challenge will be to convert battery market
share gains into bottom-line results.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duracell's big US lead is a big change from a decade ago,
when Duracell and Energizer often ran neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
   For the month of June, Duracell claims to have had a 50.2
percent share of the US dollar market, up from a 48.2 percent share
the previous June. Energizer had a 31.2 percent share last month,
down from a 34.7 percent share the previous June, says Duracell,
citing A.C. Nielsen data; Rayovac had a 10.3 share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing damage to their business,'' Duracell senior vice
president Bruce Cleverly says of Energizer.
</P>
<P>
   Energizer declined to comment. In an earnings report released
last week, it said ``the impact of significant volume
improvements'' in North American sales of alkaline batteries was
``offset by lower average selling prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently losing customers to both Duracell and Rayovac,
Energizer has been discounting aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   How could Energizer lose so much market share so quickly? Part
of the answer is Rayovac, and part of it is Duracell.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, about 18 months after its acquisition by
Boston-based Gillette for $7.82 billion in stock and debt, Duracell
unveiled the Ultra premium battery, in essence taking a page from
Gillette's razor playbook and adapting it to alkaline batteries.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, a razor blade _ like the battery _ would seem
to be the humblest of commodities. But time and again, Gillette has
persuaded consumers to pay more for a razor marketed as a
state-of-the-art product that gives added value.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, it was Trac II. Then came Atra and Sensor. Each time,
consumers were bombarded by ads urging them to upgrade to a more
expensive razor. Each time, the strategy worked.
</P>
<P>
   In retail lingo, Gillette ``segmented the market'' by giving
consumers a range of razor choices at different prices. Male
shavers can buy a Sensor, a SensorExcel _ or the new Mach3.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Gillette has applied variations of this formula
to other categories, including toothbrushes and pens.
</P>
<P>
   But not every attempt to transform a commodity into a premium
brand through a big marketing campaign has met with success.
</P>
<P>
   Take Gillette's stationery lines. Its Parker and Paper Mate pens
have been hit by declining sales, and some investors now think
Gillette should sell off its stationery business _ and maybe get
rid of all or part of its underperforming Braun appliance division
as well; that way, Gillette could focus on its strongest product
categories of razors, batteries, and oral care products, they
argue.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strategy of segmenting the market and urging
consumers to trade up seems to be working for Duracell.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ultra came out last year, skeptics scoffed. The last
thing the world needed, they said, was an upscale battery, one
costing 20 to 30 percent more than Duracell's standard batteries.
All alkaline batteries are alike, the critics said, and consumers
should buy whichever brand was on sale.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying the product as hero, Duracell ad campaigns suggest
otherwise. What the Mach3 is to the SensorExcel, it said, the Ultra
is to the standard Duracell battery.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a no-name battery is fine for a Cub Scout's $3 flashlight,
but for such ``high-drain'' devices as cell phones and digital
cameras, the Ultra is the gold standard of battery technology,
something well worth paying extra for, ads hint.
</P>
<P>
   Alkaline battery sales figures for the last seven months suggest
that consumers are responding to that message.
</P>
<P>
   With a 7.3 percent dollar share of the US market for the month
of June, Ultra is the big reason why Duracell has been widening its
dollar market share lead over Energizer.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Energizer's parent, Ralston Purina Co., announced
plans to spin off its Energizer and Eveready battery lines to focus
on its more profitable pet food business. While Ralston Purina has
sold several business units recently, the Energizer spinoff may be
partly due to Duracell's widening lead.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff is ``an admission right there that Gillette has been
a very formidable competitor,'' says Fred Russell, whose Oklahoma
investment firm has owned Gillette stock since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A spinoff would likely have little effect on Duracell. Whether
alone or as part of larger company, Energizer will continue to be a
player to be reckoned with, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Energizer has been hurt as much by Rayovac as by Duracell.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Boston investment firm Thomas H. Lee Co. bought out
family-run Rayovac Corp. and took the company public in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Making big strides ever since, Rayovac uses Michael Jordan ads
to promote Rayovac as a ``value brand,'' with prices 15 to 20
percent lower than those of Duracell and Energizer.
</P>
<P>
   According to company spokesman John Daggett, a big part of
Rayovac's recent surge has come from doubling the number of US
retail outlets where its batteries are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a distribution game,'' Daggett says of the battery
business. ``Eighty percent of batteries are bought on impulse. It's
not a category with a lot of brand loyalty.''
</P>

   With Duracell on the high end and Rayovac on the low end,
Energizer has gotten squeezed in the middle, say analysts, who
expect Energizer to come out with its own premium battery line to
compete with Ultra.
</P>
<P>
   One man not overly impressed by Duracell's widening market share
lead is John McMillin, a Prudential Securities analyst who follows
Ralston Purina.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Duracell's recent gains have come from consumers
replacing their regular Duracell batteries with costlier Ultra
batteries, he says; it's Rayovac that's stealing customers from
Energizer, a point Duracell disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Market share is all very fine, but what about profits?
</P>
<P>
   According to Duracell, its plan of investing heavily in
marketing and promotions now will reap big future profits.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to be bullish on batteries these days _ even without
Y2K concerns that may have some folks scrambling to stockpile
Duracells and Rayovacs for their survival kits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, a typical US household owned just two battery-powered
devices, a flashlight and a transistor radio, and old-fashioned
zinc batteries were more than adequate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the wide use of everything from GameBoys to smoke
detectors and Walkmans, a US household owns about 20 portable
devices and spends just over $20 a year on batteries to power them.
With more portable and digital products coming onto the market all
the time, that amount is only likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Most batteries bought in the United States are alkaline, but
many other countries still rely on zinc batteries, which aren't as
well suited to newer high-tech devices. As these countries upgrade
to alkaline, it should benefit Duracell, a company with an alkaline
focus and a global distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of unit sales, the battery market is growing by 8
percent a year, notes analyst McMillin, adding, ``There are not
many (product) categories doing that.''

   Is Puff Daddy the black Sinatra?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, why not _ especially if you can overlook the fact that
he's a talentless hack who's never had an original idea in his
life, and has made his fortune plundering everyone from David Bowie
to Grandmaster Flash to Led Zeppelin. But in the August issue of
GQ, Puffy tells writer David Kamp he views himself as some kind of
ghetto-fabulous reincarnation of Ol' Blue Eyes _ ``Ol' Brown
Eyes,'' if you will. See, the mogul born Sean Combs, has this room
_ ``the Lounge,'' he calls it _ in his midtown Manhattan recording
studio, where he and his artists can chill during sessions. With
its low-slung furniture and wet bars, he was going for that Rat
Pack vibe. ``The whole concept of it was Black Sinatra,'' Puff
explains. ``Like if Frank Sinatra was black, and he was my age, and
he was me, what kind of hangout would he have for Dean and Sammy
and the guys to come see him at the studio.'' But, says Puffy,
don't let the Bentley, the home in the Hamptons, and the
ever-present bottles of Cristal fool you. He's just a former altar
boy trying to get a little love and respect. He's Mr. Contrition
when he discusses his April arrest for second-degree assault on
Interscope Records executive Steve Stoute, after Stoute resisted
the removal of a crucified Puffy from Nas's ``Hate Me Now'' video.
``I was thinking whatever I had to do to get that video off the
air, I was ready to do,'' Puffy says. ``And I was wrong _ as a
Christian, you have to turn the other cheek.'' Stoute has since
dropped charges, but alas, the Manhattan district attorney's office
is still pursuing the case. But as Puffy himself once said, ``Can't
nobody take my pride, can't nobody hold me down'' _ oh, wait a
minute, he sampled that rejiggered line from Matthew Wilder's
``Break My Stride.''

   Many a band has gone belly-up in the quagmire of egos, drugs,
and just plain stupidity that has fueled popular music for nearly a
half-century. One of the more recent examples is the Verve, which
finally came undone just as it seemed they were about to crash the
States. Shortly after the British band's 1997 hit ``Bitter Sweet
Symphony,'' broke big, the Verve broke up. In Q's post-mortem, Phil
Sutcliffe gets to the core of the split from ``prologue to
hari-kari.'' From their early 1990s birth, the five-member band,
led by mercurial Richard Ashcroft, was always a fragile but
fascinating unit. Their music fell somewhere between the pure
muscle-pop of Oasis, and the thinking-cap rock of Radiohead.
Success at home came quickly, and so did the inherent problems of
fame _ various mood- and mind-altering substances, identity crises,
shattered love lives, and a bitter rift between Ashcroft and
guitarist Nick McCabe, exacerbated by both men's delicate mental
states. Writes Sutcliffe of Ashcroft and McCabe, ``They were great
together and they never got on. A lot of magic, a load of loss.''
By article's end, it's less a wonder that the band imploded than
that they were ever a band at all.

   OK, so electronica never really became the Next Big Thing the
know-nothings assured us it would be. Still, it has produced
several standout artists including Fatboy Slim, Underworld,
Propellerheads, and the Chemical Brothers, who have a sit-down with
Q's Andrew Collins. Far from being weirdo tech-heads more
comfortable with machines than humans, the ``brothers'' _ Tom
Rowlands and Ed Simons _ come off as regular guys who just happen
to love turntables more than guitars (well, at least live ones).
Not surprisingly, they take umbrage at those who trivialize what
electronica artists do _ even when the words come from a turntable
compatriot like Norman ``Fatboy Slim'' Cook. ``I don't like the
idea that he has to present it as dumb music for a Saturday
night,'' says Simons, who adds that he and Rowlands want to ``dumb
up'' dance music. ``It's not dumb music. It's galling when he says
that.''

   In Poz, David Groff explores the art of Barton Benes, who has
created such controversial works as a palette of HIV medications,
an hourglass with the ashes of friends, and a watergun filled with
his own HIV-positive blood. Benes has always been a collector of
the strange and macabre. Among his peculiar treasures: a mummified
Egyptian cat, Larry Hagman's gallstone, a skull fragment from a
victim of the Black Plague. In Sweden, ``Lethal Weapons,'' his
exhibit of poisonous darts, perfume atomizers, Molotov cocktails,
and water pistols filled with his blood and placed under safety
glass, was quarantined until Benes allowed it to be heated at 160
degrees in a hospital oven. In Britain, tabloid headlines branded
it an ``AIDS Horror Show.'' But Benes _ whose next exhibit,
``Transubstantiation,'' includes a piece of rubble from O. J.
Simpson's Rockingham Estate carved into the shape of a knife, and a
picture of a bird painted with oil from the Exxon Valdez _ is
undeterred. He wants to make political art that provokes,
challenges, and disturbs its viewers. ``It's not something you can
look at like a decorative thing on the wall,'' Benes says. ``You
have to read it. And once you do, it's like trying to put down a
good book. You can't.''

LOVE IN A DEAD LANGUAGE 
By Lee Siegel 
University of Chicago Press, 375 pp., illustrated, $25.00 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to its publicist, ``Love in a Dead Language'' is a
novel that can be read in many positions, but you'd better be able
to laugh in all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the novel is love, and the principal narrative is a
love story. Leopold Roth is an American professor of Asian studies
who is undertaking a new translation of the ``Kamasutra,'' the
celebrated ancient Sanskrit philosophical text about sex and love.
As he works, Roth becomes obsessed by one of his students, Lalita
Gupta, an all-American girl of Indian descent who thinks she's in
love with the college basketball star. Although he's been
respectably, even happily, married for years, Roth is prepared to
risk everything for love. He will stoop to the most ingenious and
humiliating stratagems to have Lalita; he even arranges a bogus
study-in-India program, and she will be his only student. For his
folly, Roth will pay a very high price; in disgrace with fortune
and in men's eyes, he dies under mysterious circumstances after
being stuck in the face by a copy of Monier Monier-Williams's
mighty Sanskrit-English Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   The story unfurls and unravels as Roth's translation and
autobiographical commentary on the ``Kamasutra,'' with additional
commentary by the Persian translator of the ``Kamasutra,''
Pralayananga Lilaraja, and by Roth's pedantic graduate student,
Anang Saighal.
</P>
<P>
   These texts and commentaries are supplemented by others,
including pages from a script of a movie that had starred Roth's
parents; pages from a proposed Classics Illustrated comic devoted
to the ``Kamasutra''; several CD-ROM screens; the privately printed
memoirs of a randy Victorian colonialist; a synopsis of a feminist
forgery of a nonexistent ``Kamasutra'' written from a woman's point
of view (a ``discovery'' of a self-invented scholar who calls
herself Tajma Hall); a ``Kamasutra'' board game (more fun than
Parcheesi); the autobiography of the priapic movie star Jock
Newhouse (English for Jacques Casanova); an interview in a porn
magazine called Cocktail; some correspondence between Leo Delibes,
the composer of the opera ``Lakme,'' and the widow of the first
English translator of the ``Kamasutra,'' Sir Richard Burton; and
earnestly inept passages from a term paper by Lalita Gupta herself
_ ``People acting out the divine ground of the universe in weird
positions are common in Indian art.'' Lakme's ``Bell Song''
tintinnabulates out to very far horizons.
</P>
<P>
   The book affectionately satirizes two world cultures and the
ways they view and illuminate each other; it is an academic novel
about nonacademic subjects; it spans high culture and low comedy.
To accommodate all of this, the book must be a triumph of
typographical virtuosity. Some of it has the look of a scholarly
text, with footnotes, a bibliography (``Everything about erotica is
invariably disguised behind false authors, publishers, dates, and
places of publication. Nothing is what it seems, and it is this
more than anything else that is the fascination of the subject for
its bibliographers''), and even an index. The book is printed in
different fonts and colors; some of it is upside down, and some of
it is inverted and can be read only with the assistance of a
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Chicago Press deserves congratulations for
producing such a sensuous and unusual volume out of Lee Siegel's
hypertexts. The press is also to be congratulated for publishing
``Love in a Dead Language'' at all, because the book is such an
intellectual extravaganza, but with belly laughs _ a set of
virtuoso linguistic and psychological variations on a theme of the
widest popular appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel is a professor of Indian religions at the University of
Hawaii; he is also a professional magician who has obviously pulled
more than one rabbit out of his hat. He even introduces himself
into his novel as a jealous academic rival of Leopold Roth. From
``Love in a Dead Language,'' it is clear that Siegel is widely read
in several languages, that he likes the way languages work and
play, that he revels in Maria Montez movies, that he relishes human
ingenuity, sympathizes with self-delusion, enjoys thinking about
sex, and can't be embarrassed by anything. Collectively, the book
is a meditation on the dignity and indignity of sex and the rapture
of love, and their complicated and explosively tragicomic effects
on human behavior. The novel is seriously funny and outrageously
philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   The reader can tell that Siegel admires Laurence Sterne's
``Tristram Shandy'' and Vladimir Nabokov's ``Pale Fire'' and
``Lolita,'' as well as the the metafictions of John Barth, but
those works have only helped his book become the unique thing it
is: preposterous, lubricious, enjoyable, and memorable, an
elaborately entertaining joke about a subject that's no joke.

`DEEP BLUE' DELIVERS A NOT-QUITE-SO-KILLER SHARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DEEP BLUE SEA 
Directed by: Renny Harlin 
Screenplay by: Wayne Powers, Duncan Kennedy &AMP; Donna Powers 
Starring: Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, LL Cool J, Jacqueline
McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard, Samuel L. Jackson 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: R (graphic shark attacks, and for language) 
Star rating: 1 1/2 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smart sharks are the gimmick in ``Deep Blue Sea.'' But they
aren't smart enough to keep it from seeming the lame ``Jaws''
wannabe it is. Its only amusing element is campy dialogue,
including ripe throwbacks to the cheeseball exposition of '50s
sci-fi, with lines like ``Using genetic engineering, we increased
the brain mass, with a side effect that the sharks got smarter.''
Oh. That explains why the sharks don't phone for takeout, but use
their enlarged brains to destroy the floating lab and start eating
the scientists clinging to bits of submerged wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's more old dark house stuff in ``Deep Blue Sea''
than sci-fi. The old dark house here consists of a series of
chambers through whose steel doors the sharks keep hammering while
the survivors, led by Saffron Burrows and Thomas Jane, try to keep
from undergoing the usual shark movie career change from scientists
to submarine sandwiches. The formula is the genre's most ancient
and most reactionary, namely don't mess with the status quo, which
makes so many sci-fi fantasies fundamentally antiscience. The
problem with this one is that it's antimovie as well.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of water stained red, a string of narrow escapes,
the rapidly diminishing suspense that accompanies guessing which
ones will make it and which won't, plus a surprising racial
stereotype that involves LL Cool J playing a terrified cook who
keeps talking to God and clutching his crucifix every time his
teeth stop chattering. Scientists and technicians die, but Stepin
Fetchit lives! On the other end of the socioeconomic scale is
Samuel L. Jackson's investment banker coolly assessing the
experiments he's backing, ready to pull the plug on the expensive
research.
</P>
<P>
   The bait that scientist Burrows dangles before him is that
they'll all grow rich if her brain research yields a cure for
Alzheimer's. The bait she dangles before the sharks _ animatronic,
computer generated, and film clips of the real thing _ is herself
and her colleagues when she hoists a shark into the lab and it
begins flailing around with spectacular destructiveness after the
anesthetic wears off too quickly. Although these sharks attack in
coordinated ways and are said to be herding their prey, they behave
pretty much as all the other sharks do in all the other shark
movies.
</P>
<P>
   At times suggesting a series of outtakes from ``Waterworld,''
``Deep Blue Sea'' is as shallow as this kind of film gets. For all
the carnage, it's surprisingly boring. And forget characterization.
There are some interesting-looking actors aboard, but any
discussion of them must be deferred until they are connected to
material more substantial than this. It has not so far been a great
summer for aquatic terror. ``Lake Placid,'' the giant croc movie,
is dead in the water. And although ``Deep Blue Sea'' seems to think
it's about artificial intelligence, it plays as if it's much more
committed to artificial stupidity.

   Not too long ago I bumped into John Auerbach, the executive
director of Boston's public health commission. Auerbach seemed like
a competent, articulate, and caring fellow. Yet I ended up shouting
at him: ``You're not Jon Auerbach!''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Auerbach is the best newspaper writer on the Eastern
Seaboard. Onetime Globe scribbler, now a Wall Street Journal
apologist for the titans of capital, Auerbach wrote the single best
piece of journalism this decade: A brief essay on the agony of
putting your mother on ``hold.'' Already ensconced in my personal
Pulitzer pantheon, he only added to his luster with his recent,
published admission that he uses two different, German-made
toothpastes, one formulated for morning brushing, and one for p.m.
use.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he would like to borrow my patented, sterling silver
floss rings. Cleanliness may be next to godliness, but oral hygiene
is the ultimate state of grace.
</P>
<P>
   However, I digress. You see the problem. Too many interesting
people. Too few names.
</P>
<P>
   There are three Michael Jordans, for instance. There's
you-know-who, then the Michael Jordan who ran Westinghouse before
it took over CBS, and he got shunted aside. Then there's a very
unlucky M.J. who plays guard on the University of Pennsylvania
basketball team. When his performance falls short of expectations,
opponents taunt him: ``You're not the real Michael Jordan!''
</P>
<P>
   What about the four Richard Cohens, all of them media
somebodies? One used to produce the CBS evening news and still
consults for the network. Another reports for the National Law
Journal, and another is a columnist for the Washington Post. That
Richard Cohen has occasionally received compliments for the Jewish
mafia book ``Tough Jews,'' which was actually written by Rolling
Stone's Rich Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Comes with the territory. Washington Post writer John Kelly
added the initial F to his byline, to distinguish himself from
other famous John Kellys, including the Beatles' ``Magical Mystery
Tour'' photographer and the Baltimore Sun writer. (``John Kelly''
was also an alias used by Alger Hiss.) ``Now people ask me if I'm
the guy who wrote that book about the FBI crime lab, `Tainted
Evidence,' '' says my friend JFK. The author? John F. Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa L. Williams is the former Miss America who had to
relinquish her title after revelations that she had posed in less
than a swimsuit for Penthouse before winning her 1984 crown. She
was initial-less for many years, and carved out a successful career
as an actor and singer, until an actor on Melrose Place forced her
to take the initial, as actors' union rules forbid two
personalities having the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Wallace, who apparently doesn't follow his father Mike's
career too closely, phoned to congratulate him for winning the
Pulitzer Prize this year. The winner turned out to be New York City
historian Mike Wallace, not the pride of Brookline High. St.
Martin's Press was over the moon to learn that Oprah Winfrey had
chosen a Mary Morris novel for her book club of the air. But the
novel was ``Songs In Ordinary Time'' by Andover's Mary McGarry
Morris, not the M.M. who writes for St. Martin's.
</P>
<P>
   You might have noticed that earlier this year President Clinton
attended a ceremony at which Newsweek's Michael Isikoff received
the Edgar A. Poe award for his Lewinsky-gate reporting. The award
is named not for the great author-fabulist, but for the longtime
Washington correspondent of the New Orleans Times-Picayune. ``A
true gentleman,'' George Bush called him, words his successor would
hold in reserve when discussing Isikoff.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Harper's magazine reprinted a portion of a
1998 interview with a retired German tour bus driver named Adolf
Hittler. Herr H. never changed his name, and suffered the
consequences. The younger of his two sons junked the name. ``When I
found out, I was surprised,'' the senior Hittler said.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago I received this e-mail message from someone with the
screen name ``Poetrywoman'': ``Did you once work as a reporter at
the Boston Herald? As I recall, a very tall, very slim, very nice
guy named Alex Beam. . . '' There can be no doubt that it was me.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HINGHAM, Mass. _ It was, as they say, nifty gallifty. A
beautiful day in the neighborhood for aardvarks and icons alike.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny morning in February, Fred Rogers of ``Mr. Rogers'
Neighborhood'' fame met ``Arthur'' creator Marc Brown at Brown's
home on Main Street. The summit meeting between two members of
public television's royal family, children's program branch, was
taped for later broadcast on Rogers's show, and Wednesday (July 28)
was the day.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting constituted a return visit of sorts. Last year an
animated likeness of Mr. Rogers did a guest turn on ``Arthur,''
where the story line cast Rogers as a houseguest of Arthur's
family. Embarrassed to be seen with the cardigan-clad idol of
preschoolers everywhere, Arthur tried to hide Rogers from his pals,
fearing they would make fun of him. In the end the 8-year-old
Arthur learned a valuable lesson about true friendship and the
pains of growing up, two of Rogers's favorite topics.
</P>
<P>
   Returning the favor _ after all, what are friends for? _ Rogers
drops by Brown's studio for a drawing lesson and a chat with the
author and illustrator of dozens of Arthur books. Also on hand is
Michael Yarmush, the 16-year-old Canadian actor who provides the
voice for Arthur. Later in the show, Arthur _ in puppet form _ gets
a guided tour of Rogers's fabled Neighborhood of Make-Believe.
</P>
<P>
   Call it kiddie-show synergy or clever cross-promotion on the
part of PBS producers and executives, but the rapport between
Brown, 52, and Rogers, 71, seemed relaxed and heartfelt during the
long day of taping at Brown's studio, which began at 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Rogers were if anything even more deferential to one
another in person than mere professional courtesy might warrant.
Asked during a break in the shooting what had attracted him to
appear on ``Arthur,'' Rogers, now celebrating his 30th anniversary
on the public airwaves, broke into an expansive smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the word go,'' Rogers said, ``Marc was interested in
children. And that's much different from someone who cares first of
all about what you can sell around a show. He not only cares about
children, he's still in touch with his own childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone working in children's television,'' added Rogers,
``should remember the order of those two words, children and
television. And Marc does.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers went on to note that while his viewers tend to be younger
than most ``Arthur'' fans, not all ``Neighborhood'' viewers are
preschoolers. College students and senior citizens send in fan mail
too, he said, and one reason for that may be that Rogers, a
vegetarian and exercise buff, projects as much youthful vigor as he
does grandfatherly wisdom and reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of grandchildren, Rogers mentioned that his own
grandkids, aged 10 and 6, are ``Arthur'' devotees too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've walked through airports and had older kids come up to me
saying, `I've seen you on Arthur!' '' Rogers said with a twinkle in
his eye, tucking into a grilled vegetable sandwich. ``I love that,
because on that show I'm an aardvark.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, during another break between scenes, recalled traveling
to Pittsburgh last year, where Rogers's show is produced, to sketch
the host for his guest appearance on ``Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the best experiences of my life,'' Brown
remembered, leaning against a studio wall lined with ``Arthur''
books and artwork. ``I walked down a long hallway, opened a door,
and there was Fred. `I've been waiting for you, have a seat,' he
said. I felt like I'd known him all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown credited his producers for writing Rogers into an
``Arthur'' script, a script on which Rogers made only minimal
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a great story about something that's embarrassing to a
young person,'' said Brown, who has three children _ two sons in
their 20s and a 12-year-old daughter _ all of whom grew up in
Rogers's familiar, and familial, presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred has been a hero of mine for a long time,'' Brown
continued. ``You knew if your kids were exposed to shows like
Fred's, they were in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The cross-pollination between ``Arthur'' and ``Mr. Rogers'
Neighborhood'' is a rare one for both creators. Other than
appearances on ``Sesame Street'' and a Russian children's program,
Rogers has stayed for the most part in his own televised backyard.
His visit here was a milestone for Brown as well, the first time
Brown had allowed another TV show _ other than a news program _ to
come into Arthur's inner sanctum and poke around.
</P>
<P>
   Along with ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,'' ``Arthur'' has become
one of PBS's franchise shows. After just three seasons it already
airs in 60 countries worldwide. From books and videos to plush toys
and Web sites, it has spawned a merchandising empire as well. One
of Brown's sons helps oversee the Arthur-licensing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take this one day at a time,'' said Brown, shrugging as he
led a visitor on a tour of his basement warehouse stacked with
Arthur-related products. ``It's already been a wild ride.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who criticize Rogers's show for what might be called
its high saccharine content, Brown was quick to offer a pointed
rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a very adultist world,'' he said. ``It's easy to
forget what it's like to be the age these kids are. Fred's gift is
that he talks to them, not down to or around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown then recalled his first trip to see Rogers. He was packing
up to leave, he said, when an Arthur doll he had given to Rogers
poked its head around the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Brown laughed. ``I heard Fred say, in Arthur's voice, `Don't
worry, Marc. I'll be all right,' '' he said. ``Now who else would
do that?''

DAIRY QUEEN: A LOVE STORY

   You can't fool Warren Buffett. There's a reason he's the world's
most respected financier. This is a man who knows a good thing when
he sees one. This is a man who buys a good thing when he sees one _
and Warren Buffett owns Dairy Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dairy Queen, the fast-food franchise that time forgot and
summer embraces. Even at the height of its season, though, DQ is
anything but high-end. Small wonder that when Buffett's company,
Berkshire Hathaway, acquired Dairy Queen in 1997, a stock analyst
sniffed to Bloomberg Financial Markets that this ``lower-tier brand
name . . . doesn't fit well with what I would see as a typical
Warren Buffett investment.''
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the analyst had a point. DQ may have nearly
6,100 outlets in 25 countries and rank ninth among US restaurant
chains, but it remains a throwback to an era when the prefix ``Mc''
meant someone Scottish and Haagen-Dazs sounded like the name of a
UN secretary general. As franchising and fast foods have become the
cutting edge of global capitalism, as ice cream has attained the
status of haute cuisine (The New York Times food section reported
last month that Manhattan's priciest eateries now offer such
flavors as Tahitian vanilla-bourbon and raspberry hibiscus), Dairy
Queen has remained the endearingly clunky, enduringly
unprepossessing operation it has been since the first one opened on
June 22, 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy Queen sells its soft serve with a soft sell. Items that
bear such names as Buster Bar, Dillywich, Dilly bar, or Peanut
Buster Parfait do not cry out for admission to the high-concept
hall of fame. Uncool in everything but the temperature of its
products, DQ is Midwest retro at its most amiably American.
</P>
<P>
   Yet its resolute unhipness is part of what makes DQ so
appealing. McDonald's has more or less taken over the world. Burger
King wants to surpass McDonald's. Wendy's wants to surpass both of
them. Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC, which Pepsi spun off two years
ago as a single corporate entity, are one big artery-clogging
advertisement for that supreme '90s buzzword ``synergy.'' Against
such up-to-the-minute marketing, DQ stands as a model of
steady-state stolidity in the big-bang universe of
late-20th-century American fast food.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Dairy Queen logo. The sans-serif type and modified
amoeboid shape belong to a kind of high-'50s style that, alas,
already seemed dated by the time the logo was introduced in 1961.
It seems even more dated today, since it hasn't changed a whit
since _ nor have the outlets' red mansard roofs (Dairy Queen as
dairy barn?), also introduced in the early '60s. No, DQ does
without such concessions to the fickleness of public opinion as
design overhauls or up-to-the-minute product tie-ins. McDonald's
currently has ``Tarzan.'' KFC-Taco Bell-Pizza Hut offers ``Phantom
Menace'' giveaways. Burger King has ``Wild, Wild West'' sunglasses
up for grabs. Dairy Queen? It has the same entertainment tie-in
it's had since 1972: Dennis the Menace.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's true, some things never go out of style _ but that's
assuming they were in style in the first place. This is the beauty
of DQ. Like an endless stream of soft serve extruding itself from
God's spigot, it just keeps on going its own vanilla (and
chocolate) way.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Blizzard, of course. The Blizzard is where DQ's
deeply American love of tradition meets a deeply American love of
innovation _ and profit. The Blizzard flavor treat, a name as
beguiling as the product that bears it, is soft serve blended in a
cup with fruit, candy, or nuts of the patron's choice. The result
is dessert sublimity: the easeful texture of soft serve softened
further by the blending process and then delightfully varied by the
mixed-in crunchiness of, say, Heath bar bits or Oreo crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   A Dairy Queen franchiser named Sam Temperato tasted a product
that bore the painfully unpalatable name of ``the Concrete'' at a
St. Louis frozen custard stand. The Concrete was soft serve with
mix-ins. ``One taste of this product and I knew it was a natural
for Dairy Queen,'' he later recalled. It was Temperato who came up
with the name Blizzard and prevailed upon Dairy Queen to introduce
the product. Quite shockingly, in retrospect, he met with strong
opposition. The first DQ Blizzard was whirled (the preferred verb)
in 1985. Within a year, 200 million had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Blizzard's success has spawned numerous imitators, including
such palatable, if inferior, items as McDonald's McFlurry and
Friendly's Cyclone. Alas, McFlurries and Cyclones are far easier to
come by in Massachusetts than Blizzards are. The commonwealth
boasts 230 McDonald's and 112 Friendly's _ but a mere 33 Dairy
Queens. It could be worse. New Hampshire has just nine, Vermont
two, and Rhode Island is alone among the 50 states in having no
Dairy Queens within its borders. Even Alaska, a state where it
takes an act of will not to lower-case Blizzard, manages to support
at least one DQ.
</P>
<P>
   How DQ-deprived is Massachusetts? There's only 1 DQ for every
185,394 inhabitants. Contrast that with Minnesota, Dairy Queen's
corporate home and, clearly, a far more civilized state. The figure
there is 1 per 14,694.
</P>
<P>
   While driving through the Midwest, it sometimes seems that one
sees almost as many DQs as silos. Indeed, Dairy Queen very much
remains a heartland phenomenon, which is as it should be. It was in
Green River, Ill., that J. F. (Grandpa) McCullough and his son,
Alex, invented soft-serve ice cream. It was in nearby Kankakee that
the McCulloughs unveiled the new delicacy at Sherb Noble's ice
cream parlor on Aug. 4, 1938. ``We dished up over 1,600 servings in
about two hours,'' Noble recalls in Dairy Queen's corporate
history, ``The Cone With the Curl on Top.'' Less than two years
later, the McCulloughs and Noble opened the first DQ, in Joliet,
Ill. The rest is food franchising history. (That's no Blizzard of
hyperbole, either: Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, started out
selling cups and machinery to Dairy Queen franchisees, and later
credited his exposure to DQ as teaching him the ins and outs of
food franchising.)
</P>
<P>
   My first Dairy Queen experience was in Stoneham. Appropriately,
the site is now occupied by a bank: a symbol of DQ-disdaining
Massachusetts putting its money where its mouth ought to be. This
introduction was a good two decades or more before the arrival of
the Blizzard. I was as likely then to order from the Brazier side
of the menu _ which offers burgers, franks, and fries _ DQ's
attempt to provide some ballast for the frozen treats to follow. I
also had a weakness for the Mr. Misty, a slush concoction one
drinks through a straw. This method has the unfortunate tendency of
removing the syrup while leaving behind a cupful of unflavored
slush. Not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   My first Blizzard was in Kirtland, N.M., on Nov. 14, 1989. Some
facts a man just doesn't forget _ though the fall of the Berlin
Wall a few days before may have something to do with my clarity of
recollection. It was love at first lick. The Cold War was over, and
a cold compulsion had begun. I have since had Blizzards in Arizona,
Nevada (the only business establishment I saw in Reno without slot
machines was the DQ), New York, Ontario, Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Iowa, Oregon, California, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Maine, Florida,
and, of course, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   I've yet to have a Blizzard in Texas, though, and Texas is one
place that knows, and appreciates, Dairy Queen. It is home to 729
DQs (Illinois comes in a very distant second, with 282). It's only
fitting that the state's unofficial novelist laureate, Larry
McMurtry, has written a memoir called ``Walter Benjamin at the
Dairy Queen.'' Simon &AMP; Schuster will publish it in November.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, the German cultural critic and essayist, would hardly
seem a DQ man (coincidence or no, he died only days after the first
one opened). Yet two years before the McCulloughs and Noble served
up their first soft serve, and another 49 before Sam Temperato
turned Concrete into dessert-treat gold, Benjamin wrote his most
famous essay, whose title captures as does no other the essence of
Dairy Queen's most popular product in all its frozen glory. What is
a Blizzard, after all, if not ``The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction''?

<P>
   BOSTON -- I'm tasting Joseph Tinnirello's gnocchi, and I'm
smiling. Each elongated snail-shaped morsel is light, tastes of
potatoes just as he says it should, and brings memories of Italy.
In its lively, simple tomato sauce, it's gnocchi to spin dreams on.
</P>
<P>
   Gnocchi _ those humble amalgamations of potato, flour, and eggs
_ are rolling through restaurant menus now the way risotto did two
years ago. They're in many repertoires, but they're often
disappointing: leaden and dull, sometimes not freshly made,
sometimes altered with odd additions. To eat truly delicious and
well-made gnocchi is a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   So Tinnirello, the chef de cuisine of Terramia Ristorante in the
North End, must be one of the ancients, steeped in Old World
traditions, straight from Italy, right? Not quite. Tinnirello is
24, born and bred in East Boston. He has cut his eyeteeth almost
literally in this little restaurant, learning traditional Italian
cooking from chef and co-owner Mario Nocera in the six years that
Terramia has become a success story.
</P>
<P>
   Tinnirello, fresh-faced and cheerful, didn't learn the secret of
making such gnocchi in six short years. Or how to make his homemade
pasta, another marvel of humble ingredients fashioned into culinary
fantasy. He explains that learning those skills was mostly osmosis.
``My mother was a housewife,'' he says, ``and she cooked all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Naples, Tinnirello's mother, Yolanda, would begin
preparing the evening meal about 10 a.m. in their East Boston home.
``I was always watching my mother,'' he says. Sometimes, she would
tell him to go outside and play, but he found her simple but
time-consuming cuisine fascinating to watch. She did everything
from scratch, preserved vegetables in the summer, and always made
the pasta they ate. Every summer, the family went to Italy,
visiting his mother's relatives in Naples and his father's family
in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   When Tinnirello was 13, his mother died, and he took over the
kitchen to cook for his father, who is a welder, and for his
brother and two sisters. Since his mother hadn't used recipes, he
tried to remember what he saw and to imitate what she had done. ``I
tried many things,'' he says, laughing, ``and learned from my
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Much is made these days of the differences between authentic
Italian cuisine and the Italo-American food that evolved among
immigrants, heavy on tomato sauce and garlic. Tinnirello says he
was drawn to Nocera because he's ``just like my mother,'' basing
his food on fresh ingredients and simple preparations so that the
food's essential flavors come out. ``I fell in love with Mario just
because of the way he talks about food, how he feels about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinnirello was 18 and fresh out of East Boston High School when
he came to Terramia, the summer before starting the culinary arts
program at Newbury College. He continued working there as much as
possible while he pursued his degree. Carla Agrippino-Gomes, the
co-owner with Nocera of Terramia and nearby Antico Forno, across
Salem Street, describes him ``taking the lead from Mario'' as the
two of them worked in the tiny kitchen at the back of the
restaurant. ``To see him evolve is unbelievable,'' says
Agrippino-Gomes.
</P>
<P>
   Terramia was something new for the North End then, with the food
of Nocera following the traditional, regional styles of Italy.
Obviously, Boston was ready for a place like this. ``The first
night we opened, we had 85 people,'' says Agrippino-Gomes. ``We've
been busy ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tinnirello, the time he has spent at the 39-seat restaurant
has been a satisfying education. His accent still reveals his East
Boston roots, and as he chats in the restaurant, he slips easily
into Italian with one of the waiters. It's the language his family
spoke at home. He's become so proficient a manager that Nocera
trusts him to run the operation even for the weeks Nocera travels
in Italy. ``We always connect several times a day,'' Tinnirello
says.
</P>
<P>
   He's happy in such a small restaurant, partly because he gets to
know the customers. ``One couple hasn't missed a Friday, unless
they're on vacation,'' Tinnirello says. ``Sometimes, they come on
Saturdays, too.'' He'll come out to advise diners, especially
regulars, suggesting what's the most interesting or unusual on the
night's menu.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, he theorizes a perfect summer meal from the
ingredients list of the previous Friday. ``Soft-shells are in
season now,'' he says, so he'd suggest an appetizer of soft-shell
crabs, lightly pan-fried, and served with greens and a mint
dressing of white aged balsamic vinegar, capers, and red onions.
Then a small pasta course, just enough, of freshly made pappardelle
with roasted garlic, chickpeas, and extra-virgin olive oil. ``We
had beautiful Chilean bass'' that Friday, he says, which could be
the main course with a light saffron, fennel, and sun-dried tomato
sauce. The meal would end with a salad of shaved fennel, arugula,
and Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Tinnirello and the other Terramia cooks make pasta or gnocchi
several times a week at Antico Forno, which has a larger kitchen
and a big mixer. He doesn't really use a recipe, he says, but
starts with a certain number of eggs, say a dozen, then adds water
and a little oil and flour. ``You know by touch and eye,'' he says,
something a recipe can't specify. It takes years to learn the
tricks of pasta, and complacency can be fatal. ``You always have to
stand and watch'' as it's mixing, Tinnirello says. ``You can't walk
away.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, he adds, ``a lot of it has to do with the weather.''
Too hot, too humid, and the dough will need more flour. He
remembers times when the ``pasta came out so beautiful'' and other
times when it missed the mark, at least to his discerning taste. He
rolls out the pasta with a long, thin pin rather than putting it
through a pasta machine because ``it's faster,'' he says, modestly
not mentioning the skill that such a rolling procedure requires.
</P>
<P>
   Gnocchi are even more exacting. The potatoes have to be boiled
but not be too soft; they have to cool and be riced, then mixed
with eggs and flour. ``You don't overroll,'' he says, adding that
overhandling such dough is fatal. In the restaurant, as many as
five of the staff make the gnocchi, with Tinnirello rolling and
others cutting, forming, and marking the patterns on the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tinnirello loves eating at other restaurants _ ``I've
tried them all'' _ he's not excited about fusions of Italian with
other cuisines or about complicated food, ``too many sauces going
into each other,'' he says. ``I guess I wonder what they're trying
to accomplish. Traditional Italian restaurants can't go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating should be ``fun. My mother and I, we had fun cooking.
That's what Italians do,'' he adds. ``Food makes people happy.''

CLERGY APPEAL TO HOLLYWOOD: REIN IN THE SEX, VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Religious leaders joined entertainers and politicians who issued
a public appeal this week urging Hollywood executives to tone down
violent and sexual content in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking the entertainment industry to assume a decent
minimum of responsibility for its actions and to take some modest
steps of self-restraint,'' according to the statement, called ``An
Appeal to Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we are asking parents to help in this task, not just by
taking responsibility for shielding their own children, but also by
making their concerns known to media executives and advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the need for parents to control their
children's access to entertainment, the statement, released
Wednesday in Washington and available on the Internet
(www.media-appeal.org), asks industry executives to embrace ``a new
social compact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Allowing children unsupervised access to today's media is the
moral equivalent of letting them go play on the freeway,'' the
appeal reads. ``But today even the most conscientious parent cries
out for help from an industry that too often abdicates its
responsibility for its powerful impact on the young.''
</P>
<P>
   Signatories of the statement include Episcopal Bishop Frederick
Borsch of Los Angeles and Mandell Ganchrow, president of the Union
of Orthodox Jewish Congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was sent to executives of such giant entertainment
companies as Time Warner, Walt Disney, CBS, MGM Studios, and
Nintendo of America.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also suggests a voluntary code of conduct that
would:
</P>
<P>
   --Set minimum standards for sexual, violent, and degrading
content.
</P>
<P>
   --Make clear the entertainment industry's responsibility for the
cultural health of the country.
</P>
<P>
   --Ask the industry to commit to reducing entertainment violence.
</P>
<P>
   _Prohibit the targeting of adult-oriented entertainment to
youths.
</P>
<P>
   _Provide parents more accurate information on media content.
</P>
<P>
   _Seek the industry's commitment to increase development of
family-oriented entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood has an enormous influence on America, particularly
the young,'' the statement reads. ``By making a concerted effort to
turn its energies to promoting decent, shared values and
strenghtening American families, the entertainment industry has it
within its power to help make an America worthy of the third
millennium.''

<P>
   It was one of the most heinous crimes of America's civil rights
era. Four little black girls were killed on a Sunday morning in
1963 when the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala.,
was bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Ku Klux Klansman Robert Chambliss is the only person ever
convicted in the bombing that shocked the nation. He died in prison
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But fellow Klansman Bobby Frank Cherry, 67, who suffers from
heart disease and lives in Mabank, Texas, has long been a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, one of Cherry's three ex-wives told reporters that he
boasted about being involved in the bombing. ``He admitted it,''
Willadean Brogdon told reporters last week in Birmingham where a
federal grand jury is hearing testimony on the case. ``He bragged
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry, however, has repeatedly denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   --More than two dozen religious groups have sent a letter to US
senators urging them to pass the proposed Hates Crimes Prevention
Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although 40 states and the District of Columbia now provide
enhanced penalties for hate crimes, significant gaps still exist in
protecting all Americans from bias-motivated crimes,'' the groups
state.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would strengthen existing law by extending hate crime
protection to people who are victimized because of their sexual
orientation, gender, or disability.
</P>
<P>
   Among the signers of the letter are the National Council of
Churches, the Episcopal Church, the Unitarian Universalist
Association of Congregations, and the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we believe that state and local governments should
continue to have the primary responsibility for investigating and
prosecuting hate crimes, an expanded federal role is necessary to
ensure an adequate and fair response in all cases,'' supporters of
the bill wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has been opposed by several conservative religious
groups, including the Family Research Council and the Southern
Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. They argue the
bill would threaten the religious freedom of those who preach that
homosexuality is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   _The Southern Christian Leadership Conference was supposed to
gather Sunday (July 25) for its national convention in Charleston,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   But four days ago, the group canceled its meeting to protest
South Carolina legislators' refusal to remove the Confederate
battle flag from the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The prominent civil rights group was expected to attract 2,500
delegates to its convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will urge every organization and corporation who lives
justice to join this effort to push America back from the brink of
senseless tribalism,'' Martin Luther King III, president of the
SCLC, told reporters from the steps of the Statehouse in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot at this point in history resurrect ghosts of the
past and allow the resurgence of racism, discrimination, and the
politics of resentment that the Confederate flag reclaims,'' added
King, son of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

AGRONSKY'S LOW-KEY STAR POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ He was innovative yet utterly traditional. He
was aggressive yet always a gentleman. Martin Agronsky, who died in
Washington Sunday at 84, was in the heroic pantheon of radio and
television news, a list that included Elmer Davis, Edward R.
Murrow, Howard K. Smith, Eric Sevareid, and John Chancellor. All
were serious, but all knew how to have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Agronsky was a pioneer at least twice in his career. In 1956 he
helped open up the political nominating conventions. ``The zoom
lens and floor access changed everything,'' he once told me. ``No
smoke-filled room could overturn the verdict of the primaries when
people were watching in their living rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, after working for all three networks, he started
``Agronsky and Company,'' a talking-head session on Saturday nights
on Channel 9 in Washington. The format was simple and
much-imitated, except that Agronsky, who never raised his voice,
set an example for his panelists. It was a conversation, not a food
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Working for ABC, he covered the first televised conventions from
Philadelphia in 1948. The coaxial cable then reached only from
Boston to Richmond. Politicians had to be cajoled off the floor for
interviews. ``Worse yet, they had to wear heavy makeup, with
practically black lipstick. The equipment was primitive, the lights
were incredibly hot, and everyone was sweating,'' he recalled. ``It
was horrible _ also hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuven Frank, Agronsky's boss at NBC, now lives ``in deep
retirement'' in New Jersey. He recalls that ``Nobody was allowed on
the floor then, and nobody thought much of it. It was the way
things were; 1948 was the dark ages.'' By 1952, the platform and
credentials battles between the forces of Dwight D. Eisenhower and
Robert A. Taft ``made it a drama for us. They didn't allow us into
the committee rooms. They allowed reporters in, but no cameras, so
we kept taking a picture of the closed door.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1956, ``Martin was one of my floor reporters. Cameras were
still not allowed on the floor, so we had cameras on the periphery,
in the gallery and the radio booth.'' Agronsky regarded the
technology as a magic wand. ``It was terrific to get a governor or
a county chairman live, when something was happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1956 convention, the presidential nominee, Adlai
Stevenson, bowed to the television genie by allowing delegates, not
bosses, to choose his running mate. The contest among Senators
Albert Gore, Estes Kefauver, and John F. Kennedy made JFK a
television star.
</P>
<P>
   The conventions made television reporters into stars, too. The
Agronsky caucus outranked that of the governor of Idaho or the
chairman from Onondaga County. Agronsky was unfazed by fame. In the
early 1970s, he started a nightly program on Channel 26 in
Washington, ``Evening Edition,'' the forerunner to today's
``NewsHour'' on PBS. ``We're out here on the Shirley Highway, next
to the Beanie Weenie,'' Martin told guests he tried to coax onto
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``Agronsky and Company,'' which made print reporters
into stars recognized by cab drivers, bank tellers, and bartenders.
Peter Lisagor of the Chicago Daily News received almost a state
funeral; President Gerald Ford ordered him buried in Arlington
National Cemetery even though Pete had been only a sergeant. The
show survives today as ``Inside Washington,'' under the tutelage of
Gordon Peterson, the Channel 9 anchorman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agronsky's effort was a lower-decibel thing,'' Reuven Frank
says. ``Something else he did still hangs over that program. The
participants in that repertory company had the assignment of
covering a story for at least a couple of days that week. They knew
what they were talking about, so you got more than their opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   On too many channels today, Martin Agronsky's legacy of low-key
dignity is as quaint and distant as black lipstick under the hot
lights in Philadelphia.

IT'S TIME FOR BLACKS TO TUNE OUT TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox have 26 new television shows this fall
with no person of color in a lead role. The NAACP said the networks
were guilty of ``ethnic purification'' and ``a virtual whitewash.''
NAACP national president Kweisi Mfume has virtually assured some
sort of a boycott, saying, ``As sure as I'm standing here, you can
bet it's going to come down to that.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that smoke, it is a false alarm. Whitewashing pales next
to the brainwashing of black viewers. Ethnic purification is bad
but is merely a logical outcome of the putrifying world of
commercial TV. Boycott? Yes, boycott. But do not boycott on the
brushfire sparked by a dry white season. Boycott because black
folks need to turn off the television, period.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the networks have obviously assumed that
white viewers do not want to see black actors in power roles,
either in white or black shows. The comedies made for black
audiences are more Stephin Fetchit than Bill Cosby. Malcolm-Jamal
Warner, a star of the Cosby show, said today's black shows feature
``characters who say how ugly your mama is. . . . What Cosby showed
America was that black people can be funny without relying on
rehashed stereotypes, and, unfortunately, since Cosby, it's almost
as if everyone has totally forgotten that.''
</P>
<P>
   Television has so forgotten black folks, as well as other people
of color, senior citizens, the poor and anyone else who is not
living a perfect, wealthy, and youthful Upper East Side life, it is
time to forget television. African-Americans have the television on
in their homes an average of 70 hours a week, compared with 50
hours a week in the rest of the United States, according to Nielsen
Media Research and TN Media.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP is absolutely right in the narrow sense, but it should
be far more concerned that black folks are watching nearly a full
day more TV a week than the average household. It should be far
more alarmed that on Saturday mornings, 40 percent of black
households have the TV tuned to shows light on education and heavy
on toy selling and violent action compared with 24 percent of
nonblack households.
</P>
<P>
   If black folks watched 20 hours more of shows like ``Eyes on the
Prize'' or ``Nova,'' that might be one thing. That is not the case.
The two top syndicated shows in black households are the World
Wrestling Federation and Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that white viewers are smarter or their
shows are better, with shows more about gross guys than gracious
gentlemen. And everyone is entitled to some vacuous entertainment
after a hard day. But black folks cannot afford to watch quantum
volumes more of dumb TV when studies suggest that massive viewing
indeed damages the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a survey of 2,245 grade-school children published in
the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry found that children who watch more than six hours of
television a day are more likely to be depressed, anxious, angry,
and violent than children who watch less TV.
</P>
<P>
   A study by researchers at the University of Michigan that
followed children from the age of 8 until they were 30 found that
the children who watched significant amounts of violent television
were more likely to be more violent. A Case Western study found
sixth-graders to become more violent as television viewing
increased past three hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that educational television can increase
self-confidence, learning ability, and grades, while commercial TV
lowers them all. But with children averaging 90 minutes a day on
school days watching television, compared with just over 20 minutes
a day of study time, the learning is often diluted and drowned. The
90 minutes a day of watching television equals the average time
spent reading by a 12-year-old for an entire week. A survey of more
than 1,000 successful women in the new book ``See Jane Win'' by
Sylvia Rimm found that most of them watched less than two hours of
television a day as children.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Singer, professor of psychology at Yale University, said,
``The evidence is very strong that heavy viewing of TV by children,
particularly commercial programming, is deleterious for development
of cognitive skills and fosters agressiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   It also fosters bad health. A Harvard University study found
that men who watched TV six hours a day were more than twice as
likely to get diabetes than men who watched TV less than two hours
a week. A study published last year in the Journal of the American
Medical Association found that 43 percent of African-American
children spend more than four hours watching TV, compared with 20
percent of white children. Children who watched TV at least four
hours a day had about 20 percent more body fat than children who
watched less than two hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that can be changed,'' said Steven Gortmaker
of the Harvard School of Public Health. ``Kids don't have to watch
TV 28 hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the NAACP should be trying to change. The racial
gaps in academic achievement and health demand that black folks
watch less television no matter what concessions the NAACP wrangles
out of the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if black faces are added to this dry white season,
commercial television will still be a desert. African-Americans are
in need of another oasis.

DISAPPROVAL OF JFK JR. BIOGRAPHY SPEAKS VOLUMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Fitzgerald, a New York literary agent, thought he was doing
an obvious thing when he proposed a quickie biography of John F.
Kennedy Jr. last week.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted an appropriate author; wrote up a proposal for a
quick, commemorative print run of 40,000; and faxed it off to 12
publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, he had 12 rejections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really amazed,'' said Fitzgerald, who works at the Carol
Mann Agency. ``The comments I got were interesting. One of them
said, `We do quickie books, but we won't do John-John.' One said,
`We don't think there's any market for it,' which was really
insane.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Fitzgerald had given up the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If tomorrow we went in and Elton John died, guess what? It
would work,'' he said. ``But there was something a little too
sacrosanct about John-John.''
</P>
<P>
   As Americans hit hard by Kennedy's death emerge from their
mourning, the attempt to market his memory has started.
</P>
<P>
   But so has the public's disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   As periodicals about the Kennedys fly off shelves, publishing
circles were buzzing with news of who will come out with the first
``quickie bio'' _ the cheaply made, lightly researched books that
often emerge weeks after a major news event but that Boston
literary agent Lane Zachary of Zachary Shuster said would be ``so
incredibly cheesy'' in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say Kennedy's death may be the rare event in
which the public hunger for information is overcome by repugnance
at the thought of profiting off of a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a revulsion factor,'' said Ike Williams, a literary
agent with Palmer and Dodge in Boston. ``There's a certain place
where you better not go as a medium when you try to use something
sacred for profit. There is a point where you can make people so
angry that they destroy your company.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the public's grief over Kennedy's death is inevitably
compared to global mourning over Princess Diana's death two years
ago, the response from the New York publishing industry over the
last week has been far different.
</P>
<P>
   Within three days of Diana's death, publishers were announcing
reissues of 12 different titles, rushing more than 2.5 million
books onto the market, said Nora Rawlinson, editor of Publishers'
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   This time, by contrast, Ballantine, Pocket Books, and St.
Martins Press were quick to tell Rawlinson's trade magazine they
have no plans to put out quickie biographies.
</P>
<P>
   Some publishing specialists speculated that retailers felt they
had gotten burned by overstocked Diana books, which languished on
shelves long after the thirst for information was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean, however, that the accident hasn't generated
some surprise literary stars.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Spignesi _ whose 28 books include ``What's Your `Mad
About You' IQ?'' and ``She Came in through the Kitchen Window:
Recipes Inspired by the Beatles and their Music'' _ was buried in
his latest project, ``a consumer guide to jewelry for a major
marketing network,'' when word of the accident reached him.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has watched his 1997 book, ``The John F. Kennedy,
Jr. Scrapbook,'' climb from a spot ``in the 60-70,000 range'' on
Amazon.com's (www.amazon.com) bestseller list to as high as number
4.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Scrapbook,'' which had sold 9,500 copies up until
Kennedy's death, had a back order of 65,000 on the Monday after the
crash, according to the book's publisher, Stephen Shragis of
Citadel Press.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Spignesi was working feverishly on a revised
edition that goes on sale this week with a print run of 125,000,
complete with a new epilogue, a more dignified visual treatment,
and the more respectful title ``John F. Kennedy, Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My book has been out for 2 1/2 years,'' he said. ``Now they're
fielding nonstop calls from distributors. People want this book.
They want it now. Up until last week, no one wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even those making a profit draw their own line for
appropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   After watching bidding for his book go as high as $151 on the
Internet auction site eBay (www.ebay.com), Spignesi called the
online auctioneers ``commercially predatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other sellers on eBay chastised opportunists who
didn't wait ``a respectful amount of time'' to start selling
Kennedy memorabilia, ranging from hundreds of back issues of
Kennedy's magazine, George, to Internet domain names like
``www.kennedyaccident.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have been turned off by the behavior of the media and
pundits.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers at George removed associate editor Douglas Brinkley's
name from the magazine's masthead last week after Brinkley's
numerous television appearances commenting on Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, head of the Center for Government Studies at the
University of Virginia, reached a point of disgust last weekend
when a network news producer asked him to be a commentator on
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   When Sabato said he had only met Kennedy once, the producer told
him, ``That's good enough for me,'' Sabato recalled. Sabato refused
to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there are a few standards left, but I'd be surprised,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although book publishers have been up front with their
squeamishness about capitalizing on Kennedy's death, skeptics
wonder if their hesitance might be motivated by money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sense of seemliness or anything else,'' said
Helene Atwan, a veteran of New York mass market publishing who is
now the publisher of Boston's Beacon Press. ``If they're not doing
quickie bios, I suspect it's because they don't think they're going
to make any money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, three reissued biographies of Kennedy are due out soon.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Spignesi book, an Andrews McMeel title, ``John F.
Kennedy, Jr.: A Life in the Spotlight,'' will be available Aug. 1
with a print run of 200,000, and Signet's ``Prince Charming: The
John F. Kennedy, Jr. Story'' will have a print run of 350,000 and
go on sale Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Kensington Press book titled ``The Kennedys: The
Third Generation,'' originally slated for October, will be hurried
to press this week, with a print run of 375,000.
</P>
<P>
   And as Rawlinson, the editor of Publishers' Weekly, pointed out,
not everyone sees quickie books as disrespectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think providing people with that kind of thing is such
a bad thing,'' she said. ``I personally like to see books being
involved in the national culture and the national consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the word of the moment in publishing is restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary, the Boston literary agent, said she had never been as
proud of the industry as she is right now.
</P>
<P>
   This is a moment, Zachary said, when public disapproval has the
potential to trump the profit motive. It is an event, as one
observer wrote upon the death of the poet Alexander Pushkin, ``so
tragic as to silence even gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it were a wonderful tribute, there's something about
putting out a book before the body's cold that has a kind of
rudeness to it,'' Zachary said. ``The publishing world, like the
fashion world, is driven by money, but I think there is a line. I
really do.''

CANADA TURNS COLD ON CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Whether happily puffing on pricey Cohiba Esplendidos
or jetting off for cheap vacations on the sun-drenched beaches of
Varadero, Canadians have long flaunted their country's friendly
ties with Fidel Castro's Cuba, much to the irritation of American
presidents as far back as John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But the fatigues-clad dictator's continuing suppression of basic
freedoms is finally stirring outrage in the nation that has emerged
as Cuba's most important economic partner since the collapse of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted by Castro's most recent crackdown on dissidents,
Canada suddenly is putting the chill on its relations with the
Western hemisphere's only communist state _ an odd coupling that
for decades has represented the most serious foreign policy
divergence between Ottawa and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, 40 years after shooting his way to power, Cuba's
self-styled Maximum Leader is close to losing his last best friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still engaged with (Cuba), but it's time to put some
northern ice in the middle,'' said Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, whose high-profile visit to the island last year gave a
boost to Castro's image even as it incensed Cuban Americans,
conservatives in Congress and international human rights watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   Castro threw in a little ice of his own during a Revolution Day
speech on Monday, lumping in Ottawa with normal bad-boy Washington
to accuse both North American giants of dirty tricks aimed at
harming Havana during the Pan American Games in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's tougher Cuban stance, which includes suspending new
foreign aid projects, comes as human rights groups intensify
condemnation of Castro's persecution of Cubans who dare criticize
his governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba stands alone in the hemisphere for this kind of rights
abuse _ criminalizing free speech, imprisoning dissidents and
denying access to human rights monitors,'' said Jose Miguel
Vivanco, executive director of the Americas branch of Human Rights
Watch, which last week issued a stinging report on Cuba's abysmal
record.
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa, the hardening attitude toward Cuba reflects general
displeasure with the deteriorating human rights situation as well
as Chretien's particular outrage at the jailing earlier this year
of four prominent dissidents whose cases he'd pleaded personally
with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Canada is finally waking to the unhappy reality
that years of ``constructive engagement'' with Castro have produced
little in the way of democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba has not liberalized politically, it has regressed,'' said
Archibald R.M. Ritter, professor of economics and international
relations at Ontario's Carleton University, and a prominent Cuba
scholar. ``The basic rationale for Canada's policy toward Cuba is
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The final straw came in March, when a Cuban tribunal found four
well-known dissidents guilty of ``counterrevolutionary
activities,'' and sentenced them to five-year prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the secret trial, Chretien had implored Castro either
to release the four or try them in open court, in front of Western
media and human rights observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, Castro has bitten the extended hand,'' said
Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Amnesty International, at least 350 political
prisoners are languishing in Cuban jails, most guilty of nothing
more than voicing criticism of the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, which imposed an economic embargo
against Cuba after the missile crisis of 1962 brought the world to
the edge of nuclear war, Canada has kept full diplomatic ties with
Havana since Castro's ``Fidelistas'' toppled the corrupt Batista
regime in 1959 and took charge of the island that lies just 90
miles off the tip of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the outset, Canada simply believed Castro represented an
improvement for Cuba, and that the country deserved encouragement
and help, not sanctions,'' said Caroline Andrew, professor of
political science at the University of Ottawa. ``But eventually the
policy congealed into a rather bizarre form of antiAmericanism _ a
symbol by which Canada could show its independence from the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how harmless Canada's support has been is being debated
today even by longtime proponents of constructive engagement. In a
recent editorial, the influential Globe &AMP; Mail newspaper noted that
four decades of Canadian ``trade partnerships, investment,
bilateral friendship and prime ministerial visits have done nothing
to improve Cuba's wretched human rights record.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the situation, Canada has scrubbed all upper-level
official contacts with the Castro regime and suspended most new aid
projects. For the first time in years, Canadian officials are
publicly chiding Castro _ a big switch from Ottawa's usual moaning
about US sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is quietly, if a bit sarcastically, applauding
Canada's change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as really quite appropriate that Canada has made the
amazing discovery that Mr. Castro is actually a rather nasty piece
of work,'' said a US government official who monitors Latin
American issues.
</P>
<P>
   While drastic by Canadian standards, and almost certainly
delivering a big shock to Havana, Ottawa's move still amounts to
little more than a wrist slap from the country that has become
Castro's most important economic ally _ no other country sends more
tourists to Cuba, no other country funnels so much foreign aid and
hard-currency investment into the country.
</P>
<P>
   That's not going to change much, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa has no plans to interfere with the Canadian firms that
have become Cuba's No. 1 source of foreign investment or clip the
wings of the 150,000 or so Canadian ``snowbirds'' who sustain the
island's nascent tourist economy.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way commerce between Cuba and Canada came to $555 million
last year, with Canada's imports of Cuban nickel alone accounting
for nearly one-quarter of Cuba's hard currency revenues. Since
1990, meanwhile, Canadian firms have invested more than $600
million in Cuba _ building airports, golf courses, pizza outlets,
power facilities, hotels and mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians should hang in, come hell or high water,'' said
businessman Ron Weissberger, vice president of Intelcan
Technosystems Inc., an Ontario-based civil aviation and
telecommunications firm. ``Those who stay will reap the benefits
later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian investors tend to shrug off moral concerns over doing
business in Castro's police state, noting that other countries,
most notoriously China, have much worse records but are still
eagerly courted by investors and economic officials from Western
democracies, including Canada and the US.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials, meanwhile, refuse to comment on their country's
damaged ties with Canada. A spokesman for the Cuban embassy in
Ottawa said only that any differences will be resolved directly
with Canada, not discussed with an American newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed, however, that the hierarchy in Havana is
especially alarmed by Canada's threat to stop backing Castro's
attempts to reintegrate Cuba into the community of Western
hemispheric nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa was set to go to bat for Cuba's admission to the
Organization of American States, something that Castro would
desperately like to accomplish before the the Summit of the
Americas, to be held in Quebec City in 2001. But Canadian officials
say they no longer will support Cuba until it dramatically cleans
up its human rights act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is moving progressively toward a hardball approach to
Cuba,'' said John Kirton, a professor of political science at the
University of Toronto. ``Cuba's human rights record has become
Canada's embarrassment.''

MEDICAL SOCIETY MISSION FALLS ILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Twenty-seven years ago, the Massachusetts Medical Society
chastised one of its members for ``undue promotion'' because his
research findings were reported in Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Medical Society fired the editor of the New
England Journal of Medicine because he balked at a marketing scheme
to trade on the name and reputation of the prestigious scientific
publication.
</P>
<P>
   My, how sensibilities have changed at the nation's oldest
medical society!
</P>
<P>
   The forced resignation of Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer would be a
trade publishing footnote were it not for the backdrop of public
suspicion about the direction of American medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The unease in the medical community that greeted word of Dr.
Kassirer's abrupt dismissal mirrors the fears of patients that
their doctors are basing treatment decisions less on medical than
on financial considerations.
</P>
<P>
   That fear and unease are well-placed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack T. Evjy, president of the Massachusetts Medical
Society, says Dr. Kassirer was forced out of his job because of
``administrative and publishing issues.'' What he means is that Dr.
Kassirer would not exploit the New England Journal's highly-prized
brand name to hawk less rigorously edited newsletters and other
commercial publications being launched to line the coffers of the
already resource-rich Medical Society.
</P>
<P>
   It is technically true that the Massachusetts Medical Society
has owned the 187-year-old New England Journal of Medicine since
1921. In that time, the publication has grown into one of the most
well-respected arbiters of medical research. But the scientific
community has long considered the Medical Society less an owner
than a trustee, a guardian of the high standards represented by Dr.
Kassirer's eight-year tenure as editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kassirer broadened the Journal's scope, inviting more
submissions from overseas researchers and making articles more
accessible to the general practitioner. He says the Medical Society
never tried to exert editorial control over the 230,000-circulation
magazine, but it is hard to imagine that parochial bunch
enthusiastically embracing Dr. Kassirer's stands in favor of the
medicinal use of marijuana and against the excesses of managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Society's concerns have always been of a much more
pedestrian and self-absorbed nature _ financing construction of an
office building in Waltham to house its growing publishing empire,
hiring lobbyists to fight any effort to tighten disciplinary rules
governing Massachusetts physicians.
</P>
<P>
   By injecting itself and its financial interests into the
operation of the New England Journal of Medicine, the Medical
Society further undermines confidence that any arm of the medical
establishment in the United States is committed first to the public
health.
</P>
<P>
   Is everything in modern medicine, even as trusted a symbol of
scientific rigor as the New England Journal of Medicine, just a
tool to enhance the bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   The same year that Time magazine's report on the research of the
chief of plastic surgery at Children's Hospital prompted a sharp
rebuke from the Massachusetts Medical Society, the organization
also censured the director of Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Society accused the late Dr. John H. Knowles of
undermining ``mutual confidence and goodwill'' in the profession
because he said, in a published interview, that he suspected that
30 to 40 percent of American doctors were getting rich by
performing unnecessary medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Knowles, who was leaving Boston to become president of the
Rockefeller Foundation in New York, scoffed at his critics in the
Medical Society. He refused even to attend the meeting called to
chastise him for his alleged breach of collegiality. His words
ought to lift Dr. Kassirer's spirits this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to diddle around with these jerks,'' Dr. Knowles
said of his decision to boycott the Medical Society's formal
disciplinary hearing. ``How is it that I am the only one to be
censured by the Society in the last half century? Who have they
picked? A guy who for 20 years has run the best hospital in the
country. When the John Birch Society votes to censure
(then-President Richard) Nixon for going to China, is he going to
fight them about it?''

SWEET XVI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Senate took a little-noticed step toward good government
and good politics this week when it reinstated an obscure rule
discouraging the attachment of unrelated policy riders to federal
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Rule XVI, a century-old restriction on these piggyback
amendments, had been eliminated in 1995 by Senate Republicans
trying to ditch the Endangered Species Act. Without the rule,
members of both parties rushed in to attach riders to popular
spending bills and caused all manner of mischief: promoting timber
cutting and intrusive roads in national forests; prohibiting
abortion counseling overseas; lifting commercial fishing
restrictions in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park; allowing toxic
waste dumping on federal lands. Often these were measures their
proponents couldn't have won in a fair fight.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been loath to veto such riders because
they are inextricably linked to important funding bills _ not just
standard appropriations but emergency measures like the Kosovo
military action or hurricane relief. The riders are an abuse of the
appropriations process, create gridlock and delay, and are not the
way to run a government in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   This year Democrats have gotten into the act, trying to attach a
patients bill of rights to the agriculture budget. Attempts at
campaign finance reform and gun control have also been embedded in
various spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Republican Senate majority, mostly along party
lines, voted to reinstate Rule XVI. Democrats squawked, but they
and the nation will be better served by debating these issues
separately on their own merits.
</P>
<P>
   There are still plenty of parliamentary maneuvers available, and
citizens should remain vigilant to special-interest goodies being
slipped into otherwise innocuous bills. The timber, mining, and oil
company interests that used the riders to such effect in the 1997
and 1998 sessions will not be halted by an arcane procedural rule.
Only sustained public pressure can do that.

S.F. POLICE CAPTAIN EYES RUN FOR MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects misspelling; changes description of Castro Street)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco police Capt. Richard Cairns, whose
role in the 1989 police sweep of a mostly gay and lesbian part of
the city resulted in his suspension from the force, has picked up
papers declaring his intent to run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The move allows Cairns to raise money and explore a run for the
mayor's job without formally entering the mayor's race. ``I am
still debating (whether to run or not),'' he said in an interview,
``but I'm 90 percent sure I will run for mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Cairns has until Aug. 6 to officially enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five people have declared their intent to run, including
current Mayor Willie Brown, Supervisor Tom Ammiano, former Mayor
Frank Jordan and political consultant Clint Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in San Francisco, Cairns is a 30-year, highly
decorated veteran of the police force. He was mentioned as a
possible choice for police chief early in Brown's administration,
but that post went to then Deputy Police Chief Fred Lau. Cairns
also was mentioned as a possible member of the command staff, but
did not get that promotion, either. Currently, he is the captain in
charge of the Treasure Island station.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns said his being overlooked for a promotion earlier had
nothing to do with him considering a run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The police captain said he had been thinking about a run for
``quite a while'' and has been encouraged by friends and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what prompted me to was seeing politicians setting up to
run but not really wanting to run, and people who want to see
change but not wanting to make the changes,'' he said. ``The
professional politicians are not fixing the city. I'm an ordinary
kind of person. I relate to people. Maybe, it's time for an
ordinary person to make the city work.''
</P>
<P>
   If he runs, Cairns may have to overcome criticism from the some
members of the gay and lesbian community for his role in the Oct.
6, 1989, police sweep of Castro Street. Cairns, who was head of the
police tactical unit at the time, was given a 45-day suspension for
striking protesters and ordering a false arrest during an AIDS
demonstration in the Castro District.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was 10 years ago,'' said Cairns. ``It's behind me. I was
disciplined for whatever. I'm not going to debate the pros and cons
of that issue. ... Except that one issue, I've not had any problems
with any community.''
</P>
<P>
   During the incident, police arrested 50 people after shutting
down part of Castro Street to cars and pedestrians. People in the
area, not all of them demonstrators, were herded down the street
and prohibited from leaving stores and businesses for nearly 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns said he's since talked to gay and lesbian groups.
</P>
<P>
   If he runs for mayor, Cairns will have to take a leave of
absence from his police job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take a leave,'' he said. ``That's not a problem. On Nov.
2, I'll be back to work or going over to City Hall one or the
other.''

WOODSTOCK'S TUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woodstock: The Riot. That's what last weekend's 30th-anniversary
concert turned into, although promoters are reluctant to use the
word. They strain for euphemisms _ melee, disturbance, fracas _ and
their inability to look the problem in the eye is what helped
create it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This festival did not collapse into chaos,'' Oneida County
Executive Ralph Eannace told reporters. ``This festival had a very
serious problem for a few hours last night.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``very serious problem'' was described as a ``war zone'' by
concertgoers who watched 12 storage trailers go up in flames, a
sound tower topple, a telephone truck burn, a Mercedes flipped and
trashed, tents pulled down, and three ATM machines vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters seeking to re-create the 1969 peace and love fest _
and cash in on the popularity of the retro-'60s movement _ relied
on young, inexperienced volunteers, called ``the peace patrol,'' to
keep order. Accounts said these volunteers ignored much of the drug
use, drunkenness, and nudity exhibited over the weekend, which may
explain why the event, attended by 220,000 people, was considered
``orderly'' until Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   When an estimated 200 to 500 people became violent at the
concert's conclusion, the untrained volunteers did not know what to
do. The rampaging and looting went on for nearly two hours before
police moved in to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Had the promoters considered plain vanilla crowd control
focusing on public safety first, there might have been a stronger
police presence from day one and less rubble to sweep away at
Griffiss Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodstock has achieved mythic status not only in the minds
of those who were there and who have forgotten how deep the mud was
but for those who wish they'd been there, experiencing what
supposedly ``defined a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock was spontaneous, extraordinary, crazy, and
unforgettable, but it can't be duplicated. Anyone who tries will be
disappointed or worse. That's the great lesson in the passage of
time.

A MEDICAL JOURNAL'S INTEGRITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New England Journal of Medicine is a national asset. Its
mission to publish authoritative reports about medical advances and
to lead the debate about health-related issues should not be
compromised in any way.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what the Massachusetts Medical Society has done by
deciding to fire Dr. Jerome Kassirer, whom the president of the
Medical Society describes as a great editor. Kassirer's one offense
was to oppose plans to dilute the integrity of the Journal by
holding its reputation hostage to less-renowned Medical Society
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kassirer nor Dr. Jack Evjy, the Medical Society's
president, will reveal the details, but the disagreements go back
several years and include such matters as whether there should be a
link to the Barnes &AMP; Noble Web site in Journal book reviews posted
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer and his staff pride themselves on integrity, going so
far as to insist on the segregation of advertising pages from
editorial content. Journal procedures can seem archaic at times,
from the use of pencils in editing to its refusal to leave its
offices at the Harvard Medical School library for the Medical
Society's headquarters in Waltham, Mass. But the publication is
second to none in credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer took the Journal onto the Internet, established a
fast-track procedure for urgent medical news, and used the opinion
columns to respond nimbly to issues ranging from cloning and
medical use of marijuana to starvation in Somalia. He is hardly
caught in the musty past. He understands, however, that the Journal
needs to be protected from even the appearance that its good name
will be used to promote other agendas.
</P>
<P>
   If the Medical Society insists on replacing Kassirer, it should
choose an editor of equal integrity and skill. Dr. Marcia Angell,
the executive editor, would be an excellent choice, but she shares
many of Kassirer's concerns. Evjy said, ``We are absolutely
committed to maintaining the Journal's preeminent position.'' He
can do that by finding another superb editor and making sure the
society keep hands off its most authoritative publication.

A WISE VOTE IN FAVOR OF CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week's 260-170 House vote to renew China's normal trade
status _ misleadingly called most-favored-nation status _ comes at
a time when US-Chinese relations are troubled and Chinese leaders
are showing signs of insecurity. Fortunately, both the Clinton
administration and the Republican leadership in Congress called
forcefully for extending to China the same low tariffs that nearly
all other US trading partners enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Not to renew China's trade status would have made a bad
situation gratuitously worse. With Beijing still smarting from the
bombing of its embassy in Belgrade and with Washington straining to
dissuade the Communists from taking military action in response to
Taiwan's retreat from the one-China principle, a vote to raise
tariffs on Chinese goods could have wreaked incalculable harm on
bilateral relations and US interests.
</P>
<P>
   No less delicate was the relation of the House vote to the
crucial economic decisions that China's leaders are poised to make.
Their panicky crackdown on Falun Gong, a faith-healing sect, may
well stem from their worries about the effects of economic
difficulties that have left millions of Chinese workers unemployed
and millions of others without proper pensions or health care.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress was debating China's trade status, Chinese leaders
were congregating in the seaside resort of Beidahe to set policy on
potentially explosive issues. They must decide whether to continue
closing or privatizing money-losing state-owned enterprises. They
cannot solve their mounting economic problems without completing
this transition to a market-driven system, yet these indispensable
reforms threaten social stability and the Communist political
order. If the decision makers had thought Chinese goods would be
singled out for punitive tariffs, they might have felt impelled to
reverse the course of reform and devalue the yuan, thereby
deflecting the economic recovery underway among their Asian
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   This is a time to speed China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, not play sorcerer's apprentice with the world's most
populous country.

MORE A BUTLER THAN A MUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite high-tech industry hype about computers
becoming the focus of our future, users really want their machines
to become everyday household appliances, helping them do the
laundry, stand in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles and
handle other mundane chores.
</P>
<P>
   So says a recent survey of 1,001 computer users released by
Texas- based computer manufacturer Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The random survey, conducted between June 14 and June 28,
questioned computer users who use the Internet at least once a
week. Approximately 67.5 million users in the United States access
the Internet weekly.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Dell survey, various DMV tasks topped the
computer-task wish list, including renewing driver's licenses and
license plates (90 percent) and paying speeding and parking tickets
(70 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Voting was also a popular computer choice, according to 78
percent of the respondents. Manipulating photos was also a big hit
(80 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Half of those who answered the survey said they also want their
computers to help them do the laundry and water the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven percent of those surveyed want their computers to
handle home security. A little less than half _ 47 percent _ said
they would use their computers to order groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Marci Grossman, a Dell Computer spokeswoman, said the survey
shows how the computer is being integrated into our lives. ``It's
central in daily life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the survey shows that users want their computers to
fade into the background, becoming just another common household
appliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of technology is to get the hell out of the way,''
said Cliff Stoll, a University of California at Berkeley astronomer
and author. ``The point of technology is not to have a computer.
The point of technology is to get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Computing does its best work when you can't tell
it's there. The computer that controls the fuel injectors in your
car is great. I have a lot of respect for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``the computer that crashes every time I fire up three
programs is terrible. Yet it is the one that gets the attention _
the rave reviews in the computer magazines,'' Stoll said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer as home-based taskmaster is a view echoed by
visitors to a Microsoft store in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the high-tech store, a banner proclaims, ``Where do you
want to go today?''
</P>
<P>
   According to passersby, not very far. Of the 20 people
questioned at Metreon, 18 said they want their computers to handle
routine, day-to-day home chores, such as balancing a checkbook,
controlling the lights in a house and, of course, avoiding DMV
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers were supposed to be our slaves,'' said Joan Didre of
Wisconsin. ``Now,'' she said, gesturing to the flashing screens and
lights of the Metreon interior, ``they're taking us over. It's time
we put them to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be way cool to not have to go the DMV, ever,'' said
Emus Landers of San Francisco. ``And I'd love to vote from my
house.''
</P>
<P>
   (Two visitors said they wanted their computers to help them find
love.)
</P>
<P>
   Kim Alexander, president of the Sacramento-based California
Voter Foundation, is cautious about the prospects of online
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of privacy, security and fraud concerns that
need to be addressed before people would be comfortable with voting
over the Internet,'' said Alexander, who is part of a state task
force studying the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are on the Internet to save time, not to waste time, so
it's not surprising, especially with government transactions, that
they want to cast a ballot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Security is also a road block to online DMV transactions, said
California DMV spokesman Evan Nossoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're looking at,'' he said. ``We really don't
want people to come to the DMV field offices to stand in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Nossoff added that the DMV does want to see in person those
taking the license renewal test, required every 15 years. Because
of a 50 percent failure rate for that test, Nossoff said, ``there's
a huge potential for fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dell survey points to a contradiction: While computers
become increasingly complex, users struggle to make them perform
simple tasks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a battle San Jose's Randy Tamez has to fight every day.
</P>
<P>
   Blinded by a brain tumor in 1989, Tamez depends on his computer
and special software to perform routine tasks, such as reading his
e-mail, city bus schedules, radio guides and the like. As the
Internet and the computers that access it become laden with
features, he has to scramble to find ways to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My computer is an essential tool,'' he said. ``I depend on it
for very simple stuff, but the manufacturers are intent on making
them more and more complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Tamez: ``All the advertising and marketing says hooray for
this or that new computer feature, but all it does is leave people
in the dust. It's disheartening.''

home turf will provide clues to his strategy for retaining their

   GWBUSH-FAITH _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush argues that
``faith-based'' programs can transform lives in ways that
government can't, and he has pushed hard for more ties between
Texas and ``faith-based'' and community groups since 1996. But as
he seeks to take the idea national in his presidential bid, Texas
officials don't have solid empirical evidence on performance and
critics worry about violating the separation of church and state.
While there are many questions, the programs have lots of
supporters because they can provide what government can't:
confidence and faith in oneself. (Greenberger, Austin

   FALUN-GONG _ While the Chinese government cracks down on
practitioners of Falun Gong, we talk to Atlanta-area practitioners
of the new meditation sect to find out what it is and what they
think of the crackdown in China. They're not angry about it _
because they're never angry about anything _ but they're very sad
and concerned. About 15 or 20 Atlanta Falun Gongians are in D.C.
right now, protesting in front of the Chinese embassy when they can
get a permit. They say they fear Chinese authorities may even begin
executing practitioners, and that is what their demonstration is
meant to prevent. (Melvin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. WITH

Madison County Tax Assessor Wayland Cooley. The 83-year-old

Thursday, July 29:
</P>
<P>
   INHERIT-FIGHTS (Undated) _ Familial fights over inheritance are
ripping apart many a middle-class clan. Six years ago, economists
predicted the largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in
history _ approximately $12 trillion _ would take place from then
until around 2020 as the security-minded Depression generation dies
off and leaves its money and its carved mahogany bedroom suites,
split-level ranch houses, family china, grandfather clocks and
moldering photographs to its baby boom children, a generation
weaned on irony, credit cards and broken marriages. By Neal Karlen.
</P>
<P>
   INHERIT-WORTH (Undated) _ If you've inherited a Matisse, you
probably know what to do with it. But what if you've been left two
cardboard cartons full of cut glass ashtrays and celery dishes? A
vintage 1947 Lionel train set? A Russian sable _ with only a small
tear under the arm? How do you get rid of this stuff _ and, you
hope, realize its full worth? By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   CONCIERGES (Undated) _ Its front-line employees having just
completed a three-month training program to improve service for
travelers, Amtrak announced in advertisements this month that
``10,000 employees went back to school. 10,000 concierges
graduated.'' In the same way that the breakfast roll became a
croissant, even with a fried egg and Canadian bacon on it, the
concierge has become a concept that knows few bounds. Though it
bases its popularity on the reputations of four-star hotel desk
clerks, for whom no service request is unrealizable, today's
concierge is untethered to performance. By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTLAND-MUSEUM (Edinburgh, Scotland) _ The notion that Scotland
is a more beguiling place than the dark and rugged land it occupies
has found fitting expression in the alluring new Museum of
Scotland. In a modern building set on a hillside in Edinburgh's
medieval old town, the museum has a smoothly turned drum tower, a
furrowed roof terrace, slender windows and a sandstone exterior
with the amber flush of a sunset spreading across a Highland moor.
Enter and you're in a luminous castle keep. Indoor bridges span the
lofty courtyard space and staircases and narrow passageways
disappear invitingly into walls. It is a building of chanced-upon
spaces that promise a series of adventures. By Warren Hoge.

SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ About two years ago, Veronica Ruiz had a Web
site for her business, a supply and repair store for typewriters
and fax machines, but she got tired of paying $78 a month to a Web
posting company for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any good in it. I got maybe one call in eight
months,'' said Ruiz, owner of San Francisco Business Machines Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz's frustration with the Web is typical of small businesses.
A Gallup survey commissioned by GTE Corp. found most small business
owners realize it's important to have some sort of Internet
presence, but are unsure about what the technology can do for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an increasingly high level of awareness, but a low
level of understanding,'' said John McDonald, marketing vice
president at GTE Directories. ``A lot of people believe intuitively
it's important to their business, and while they're excited about
it, they are also apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the growth in Internet usage, Ruiz said she would be
willing to try it again _ as long as her teenage son could set it
up for free.
</P>
<P>
   According to GTE, 31 percent of small businesses have a Web site
or some sort of Internet presence. That could amount to as little
as a posting on another site or having an e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some confusion. People think because they have an
e-mail address, they're a Web warrior,'' McDonald said. ``There are
people who say `I have a URL' _ it sounds hip. But some fail to
include that on their letterhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five percent of the 500 businesses surveyed had their own
Web page (as opposed to a listing or personal page) and 18 percent
claimed to be selling a product or service over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Messina, GTE Directories' new media marketing director, said
some of those transactions may be conducted off-line.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers _ especially the transaction figure _ sounded high
to Andrew Beebe, founder of Bigstep, a San Francisco-based Web site
devoted to bringing small businesses online for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small business people are busy people. They don't have time,
and they don't have a lot of money,'' said Beebe. ``They
intuitively understand the power of the Net, but are not currently
seeing the return on the investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that of those small businesses owners
selling via the Internet, two-thirds expected sales to increase.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, 61 percent of the businesses surveyed with Web
sites said they expected to conduct sales or transactions on the
Web within the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen, the primary reason today for people in
the local small business arena to have a Web site and a presence is
image,'' McDonald said. ``I think expectations are tempered, but
that will probably not last long.''
</P>
<P>
   Several small business owners in the San Francisco-area said
they recognized the importance of having some sort of presence on
the Internet, but they didn't want it to take much time or effort.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Loui, owner of the Casket Wholesale Centre, has his
business listed with Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc., a
Pasadena-based Internet city guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use it to find the location, hours and some services,''
said Loui, who does not plan to create an independent Web site for
his business or sell caskets online. ``Just to have the presence is
sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   CitySearch executives said an average Web page of seven to 10
pages costs businesses $200 to $250 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Several business owners mentioned they were listed on the Web
site of a major company as a supplier or distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said her San Francisco Business Machines was listed on
Brothers International's site. J.C. Plumbing, Electrical and
Heating Supply is listed on fixture manufacturer Kohler's site, but
a co-owner said he would eventually like the store to have its own
Web page and sell online.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I've got to computerize this whole store,'' said J.C.
Plumbing's Jim Cheng, explaining the company had just moved next
door to a larger space. ``There's a lot of research we need to do
before we really can go into the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Wood, owner of Forest Books, which has general interest
books but specializes in rare Eastern religion books, plans to
start selling online by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he plans to have his offerings listed on the site of
one of a variety of independent book warehouses rather than develop
and maintain his own site. ``Even if only a few sell, it should pay
for itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several small business owners had no interest in being online,
but their reasons varied.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Wong, owner of Exclusively Volvo, looked into setting up
his own site but decided against it. ``We're so localized and so
specialized,'' he said, adding that 90 percent of his customers are
from San Francisco. ``For us to have worldwide exposure wouldn't do
us a lot of good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Dekelaita, owner of Ideal Upholstery, doesn't have a
computer and doesn't expect to get one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so set in our ways after almost 30 years in business,''
said Dekelaita, 63. ``I imagine if the owners are young, they will
go into it whether they need it or not. It's a gadget.''

DISAPPROVAL OF JFK JR. BIOGRAPHY SPEAKS VOLUMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Fitzgerald, a New York literary agent, thought he was doing
an obvious thing when he proposed a quickie biography of John F.
Kennedy Jr. last week.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted an appropriate author; wrote up a proposal for a
quick, commemorative print run of 40,000; and faxed it off to 12
publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, he had 12 rejections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really amazed,'' said Fitzgerald, who works at the Carol
Mann Agency. ``The comments I got were interesting. One of them
said, `We do quickie books, but we won't do John-John.' One said,
`We don't think there's any market for it,' which was really
insane.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Fitzgerald had given up the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If tomorrow we went in and Elton John died, guess what? It
would work,'' he said. ``But there was something a little too
sacrosanct about John-John.''
</P>
<P>
   As Americans hit hard by Kennedy's death emerge from their
mourning, the attempt to market his memory has started.
</P>
<P>
   But so has the public's disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   As periodicals about the Kennedys fly off shelves, publishing
circles were buzzing with news of who will come out with the first
``quickie bio'' _ the cheaply made, lightly researched books that
often emerge weeks after a major news event but that Boston
literary agent Lane Zachary of Zachary Shuster said would be ``so
incredibly cheesy'' in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say Kennedy's death may be the rare event in
which the public hunger for information is overcome by repugnance
at the thought of profiting off of a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a revulsion factor,'' said Ike Williams, a literary
agent with Palmer and Dodge in Boston. ``There's a certain place
where you better not go as a medium when you try to use something
sacred for profit. There is a point where you can make people so
angry that they destroy your company.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the public's grief over Kennedy's death is inevitably
compared to global mourning over Princess Diana's death two years
ago, the response from the New York publishing industry over the
last week has been far different.
</P>
<P>
   Within three days of Diana's death, publishers were announcing
reissues of 12 different titles, rushing more than 2.5 million
books onto the market, said Nora Rawlinson, editor of Publishers'
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   This time, by contrast, Ballantine, Pocket Books, and St.
Martins Press were quick to tell Rawlinson's trade magazine they
have no plans to put out quickie biographies.
</P>
<P>
   Some publishing specialists speculated that retailers felt they
had gotten burned by overstocked Diana books, which languished on
shelves long after the thirst for information was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean, however, that the accident hasn't generated
some surprise literary stars.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Spignesi _ whose 28 books include ``What's Your `Mad
About You' IQ?'' and ``She Came in through the Kitchen Window:
Recipes Inspired by the Beatles and their Music'' _ was buried in
his latest project, ``a consumer guide to jewelry for a major
marketing network,'' when word of the accident reached him.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has watched his 1997 book, ``The John F. Kennedy,
Jr. Scrapbook,'' climb from a spot ``in the 60-70,000 range'' on
Amazon.com's (www.amazon.com) bestseller list to as high as number
4.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Scrapbook,'' which had sold 9,500 copies up until
Kennedy's death, had a back order of 65,000 on the Monday after the
crash, according to the book's publisher, Stephen Shragis of
Citadel Press.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Spignesi was working feverishly on a revised
edition that goes on sale this week with a print run of 125,000,
complete with a new epilogue, a more dignified visual treatment,
and the more respectful title ``John F. Kennedy, Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My book has been out for 2 1/2 years,'' he said. ``Now they're
fielding nonstop calls from distributors. People want this book.
They want it now. Up until last week, no one wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even those making a profit draw their own line for
appropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   After watching bidding for his book go as high as $151 on the
Internet auction site eBay (www.ebay.com), Spignesi called the
online auctioneers ``commercially predatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other sellers on eBay chastised opportunists who
didn't wait ``a respectful amount of time'' to start selling
Kennedy memorabilia, ranging from hundreds of back issues of
Kennedy's magazine, George, to Internet domain names like
``www.kennedyaccident.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have been turned off by the behavior of the media and
pundits.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers at George removed associate editor Douglas Brinkley's
name from the magazine's masthead last week after Brinkley's
numerous television appearances commenting on Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, head of the Center for Government Studies at the
University of Virginia, reached a point of disgust last weekend
when a network news producer asked him to be a commentator on
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   When Sabato said he had only met Kennedy once, the producer told
him, ``That's good enough for me,'' Sabato recalled. Sabato refused
to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there are a few standards left, but I'd be surprised,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although book publishers have been up front with their
squeamishness about capitalizing on Kennedy's death, skeptics
wonder if their hesitance might be motivated by money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sense of seemliness or anything else,'' said
Helene Atwan, a veteran of New York mass market publishing who is
now the publisher of Boston's Beacon Press. ``If they're not doing
quickie bios, I suspect it's because they don't think they're going
to make any money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, three reissued biographies of Kennedy are due out soon.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Spignesi book, an Andrews McMeel title, ``John F.
Kennedy, Jr.: A Life in the Spotlight,'' will be available Aug. 1
with a print run of 200,000, and Signet's ``Prince Charming: The
John F. Kennedy, Jr. Story'' will have a print run of 350,000 and
go on sale Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Kensington Press book titled ``The Kennedys: The
Third Generation,'' originally slated for October, will be hurried
to press this week, with a print run of 375,000.
</P>
<P>
   And as Rawlinson, the editor of Publishers' Weekly, pointed out,
not everyone sees quickie books as disrespectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think providing people with that kind of thing is such
a bad thing,'' she said. ``I personally like to see books being
involved in the national culture and the national consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the word of the moment in publishing is restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary, the Boston literary agent, said she had never been as
proud of the industry as she is right now.
</P>
<P>
   This is a moment, Zachary said, when public disapproval has the
potential to trump the profit motive. It is an event, as one
observer wrote upon the death of the poet Alexander Pushkin, ``so
tragic as to silence even gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it were a wonderful tribute, there's something about
putting out a book before the body's cold that has a kind of
rudeness to it,'' Zachary said. ``The publishing world, like the
fashion world, is driven by money, but I think there is a line. I
really do.''

DAIRY QUEEN: A LOVE STORY

<P>
   You can't fool Warren Buffett. There's a reason he's the world's
most respected financier. This is a man who knows a good thing when
he sees one. This is a man who buys a good thing when he sees one _
and Warren Buffett owns Dairy Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dairy Queen, the fast-food franchise that time forgot and
summer embraces. Even at the height of its season, though, DQ is
anything but high-end. Small wonder that when Buffett's company,
Berkshire Hathaway, acquired Dairy Queen in 1997, a stock analyst
sniffed to Bloomberg Financial Markets that this ``lower-tier brand
name . . . doesn't fit well with what I would see as a typical
Warren Buffett investment.''
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the analyst had a point. DQ may have nearly
6,100 outlets in 25 countries and rank ninth among US restaurant
chains, but it remains a throwback to an era when the prefix ``Mc''
meant someone Scottish and Haagen-Dazs sounded like the name of a
UN secretary general. As franchising and fast foods have become the
cutting edge of global capitalism, as ice cream has attained the
status of haute cuisine (The New York Times food section reported
last month that Manhattan's priciest eateries now offer such
flavors as Tahitian vanilla-bourbon and raspberry hibiscus), Dairy
Queen has remained the endearingly clunky, enduringly
unprepossessing operation it has been since the first one opened on
June 22, 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy Queen sells its soft serve with a soft sell. Items that
bear such names as Buster Bar, Dillywich, Dilly bar, or Peanut
Buster Parfait do not cry out for admission to the high-concept
hall of fame. Uncool in everything but the temperature of its
products, DQ is Midwest retro at its most amiably American.
</P>
<P>
   Yet its resolute unhipness is part of what makes DQ so
appealing. McDonald's has more or less taken over the world. Burger
King wants to surpass McDonald's. Wendy's wants to surpass both of
them. Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC, which Pepsi spun off two years
ago as a single corporate entity, are one big artery-clogging
advertisement for that supreme '90s buzzword ``synergy.'' Against
such up-to-the-minute marketing, DQ stands as a model of
steady-state stolidity in the big-bang universe of
late-20th-century American fast food.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Dairy Queen logo. The sans-serif type and modified
amoeboid shape belong to a kind of high-'50s style that, alas,
already seemed dated by the time the logo was introduced in 1961.
It seems even more dated today, since it hasn't changed a whit
since _ nor have the outlets' red mansard roofs (Dairy Queen as
dairy barn?), also introduced in the early '60s. No, DQ does
without such concessions to the fickleness of public opinion as
design overhauls or up-to-the-minute product tie-ins. McDonald's
currently has ``Tarzan.'' KFC-Taco Bell-Pizza Hut offers ``Phantom
Menace'' giveaways. Burger King has ``Wild, Wild West'' sunglasses
up for grabs. Dairy Queen? It has the same entertainment tie-in
it's had since 1972: Dennis the Menace.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's true, some things never go out of style _ but that's
assuming they were in style in the first place. This is the beauty
of DQ. Like an endless stream of soft serve extruding itself from
God's spigot, it just keeps on going its own vanilla (and
chocolate) way.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Blizzard, of course. The Blizzard is where DQ's
deeply American love of tradition meets a deeply American love of
innovation _ and profit. The Blizzard flavor treat, a name as
beguiling as the product that bears it, is soft serve blended in a
cup with fruit, candy, or nuts of the patron's choice. The result
is dessert sublimity: the easeful texture of soft serve softened
further by the blending process and then delightfully varied by the
mixed-in crunchiness of, say, Heath bar bits or Oreo crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   A Dairy Queen franchiser named Sam Temperato tasted a product
that bore the painfully unpalatable name of ``the Concrete'' at a
St. Louis frozen custard stand. The Concrete was soft serve with
mix-ins. ``One taste of this product and I knew it was a natural
for Dairy Queen,'' he later recalled. It was Temperato who came up
with the name Blizzard and prevailed upon Dairy Queen to introduce
the product. Quite shockingly, in retrospect, he met with strong
opposition. The first DQ Blizzard was whirled (the preferred verb)
in 1985. Within a year, 200 million had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Blizzard's success has spawned numerous imitators, including
such palatable, if inferior, items as McDonald's McFlurry and
Friendly's Cyclone. Alas, McFlurries and Cyclones are far easier to
come by in Massachusetts than Blizzards are. The commonwealth
boasts 230 McDonald's and 112 Friendly's _ but a mere 33 Dairy
Queens. It could be worse. New Hampshire has just nine, Vermont
two, and Rhode Island is alone among the 50 states in having no
Dairy Queens within its borders. Even Alaska, a state where it
takes an act of will not to lower-case Blizzard, manages to support
at least one DQ.
</P>
<P>
   How DQ-deprived is Massachusetts? There's only 1 DQ for every
185,394 inhabitants. Contrast that with Minnesota, Dairy Queen's
corporate home and, clearly, a far more civilized state. The figure
there is 1 per 14,694.
</P>
<P>
   While driving through the Midwest, it sometimes seems that one
sees almost as many DQs as silos. Indeed, Dairy Queen very much
remains a heartland phenomenon, which is as it should be. It was in
Green River, Ill., that J. F. (Grandpa) McCullough and his son,
Alex, invented soft-serve ice cream. It was in nearby Kankakee that
the McCulloughs unveiled the new delicacy at Sherb Noble's ice
cream parlor on Aug. 4, 1938. ``We dished up over 1,600 servings in
about two hours,'' Noble recalls in Dairy Queen's corporate
history, ``The Cone With the Curl on Top.'' Less than two years
later, the McCulloughs and Noble opened the first DQ, in Joliet,
Ill. The rest is food franchising history. (That's no Blizzard of
hyperbole, either: Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, started out
selling cups and machinery to Dairy Queen franchisees, and later
credited his exposure to DQ as teaching him the ins and outs of
food franchising.)
</P>
<P>
   My first Dairy Queen experience was in Stoneham. Appropriately,
the site is now occupied by a bank: a symbol of DQ-disdaining
Massachusetts putting its money where its mouth ought to be. This
introduction was a good two decades or more before the arrival of
the Blizzard. I was as likely then to order from the Brazier side
of the menu _ which offers burgers, franks, and fries _ DQ's
attempt to provide some ballast for the frozen treats to follow. I
also had a weakness for the Mr. Misty, a slush concoction one
drinks through a straw. This method has the unfortunate tendency of
removing the syrup while leaving behind a cupful of unflavored
slush. Not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   My first Blizzard was in Kirtland, N.M., on Nov. 14, 1989. Some
facts a man just doesn't forget _ though the fall of the Berlin
Wall a few days before may have something to do with my clarity of
recollection. It was love at first lick. The Cold War was over, and
a cold compulsion had begun. I have since had Blizzards in Arizona,
Nevada (the only business establishment I saw in Reno without slot
machines was the DQ), New York, Ontario, Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Iowa, Oregon, California, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Maine, Florida,
and, of course, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   I've yet to have a Blizzard in Texas, though, and Texas is one
place that knows, and appreciates, Dairy Queen. It is home to 729
DQs (Illinois comes in a very distant second, with 282). It's only
fitting that the state's unofficial novelist laureate, Larry
McMurtry, has written a memoir called ``Walter Benjamin at the
Dairy Queen.'' Simon &AMP; Schuster will publish it in November.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, the German cultural critic and essayist, would hardly
seem a DQ man (coincidence or no, he died only days after the first
one opened). Yet two years before the McCulloughs and Noble served
up their first soft serve, and another 49 before Sam Temperato
turned Concrete into dessert-treat gold, Benjamin wrote his most
famous essay, whose title captures as does no other the essence of
Dairy Queen's most popular product in all its frozen glory. What is
a Blizzard, after all, if not ``The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction''?

AUSTIN, Texas: he says. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milner's Mississippi experiences also inspired his first and
only novel, ``Incident at Ashton.'' The book was published in 1961,
the same year he returned to Texas after working as an
editorial-page assistant at the doomed ``New York Herald Tribune.''
</P>
<P>
   While in New York, Milner covered the beginnings of the American
folk music uprising. Individuals such as Bobby Dylan and Joan Baez
and groups like Peter, Paul and Mary were taking their music in a
new direction. A decade later, Milner would participate in a
similar uprising in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime crony, Larry King, also launched his career as a
newspaper reporter, first in an abbreviated stopover at the Hobbs
(New Mexico) ``Daily Flare'' and later, in the early Fifties, at
the ``Midland Reporter-Telegram'' and the ``Odessa American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect,'' King later wrote, ``I believe I was fortunate
to work for small dailies where young reporters had the opportunity
to cover everything: city hall, murder trials, sports, labor
disputes, oil-well fires, state and regional politics, the police
beat with its hard-boiled cops and hard-nosed crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, King arrived in Washington with a newly elected Texas
congressman and a powerful urge to carve out a writing career. When
his hero's political career went south, King leased his loyalty to
another, more successful Texan, House Speaker-in-waiting Jim
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   King free-lanced articles and started a novel while working for
Wright. But in 1964, over the congressman's protests, he left to
write full time. Though he would produce some of his finest work in
the mid-Sixties, principally for ``Harper's'' magazine, he would
never be more than a few dollars from being deadbeat broke, until
``Whorehouse'' pranced onto Broadway in the late Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   ``King wouldn't answer the phone or the door for fear of
confronting some ill-tempered creditor,'' says Fort Worth
free-lancer Mike Blackman, who lived in New York in the Seventies
and later was editor of the Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   King had gotten his first book contract and a $1,500 advance for
a political novel called ``The One-Eyed Man.'' It was published in
1966 to mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorably cruel twist, the first review appeared in his
hometown ``Washington Post,'' and it was devastating. Recounting
that episode in ``None but a Blockhead,'' King spent the night
furiously cursing, smoking dope and guzzling beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it ... really that bad, Lar?'' his wife, Rosemarie, asked
as he stomped through their Washington apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosie,'' he responded, ``it was the ugliest thing to appear in
print since my ex-wife's divorce deposition.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Back home, history of a special kind was being made in the '50s
at the old ``Fort Worth Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackie Sherrod, the Vince Lombardi of sports writing, had hired
Jenkins, Shrake and Cartwright at the small but noisy little
tabloid, and eventually they followed him to the ``Dallas Times
Herald.''
</P>
<P>
   With columnist Dick Hitt rounding out their quirky quartet,
Jenkins, Shrake and Cartwright were proving daily that anything
worth doing was worth doing to excess.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Cartwright's hero and role model back then was
actor Robert Mitchum, the first Hollywood rebel arrested for
marijuana possession. To this day, Cartwright savors Mitchum's
response when asked about life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Hollywood,'' he replied, ``but without the
riffraff.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright also was impressed with the story about Mitchum's
appearance at a Hollywood costume party, his naked body slathered
with ketchup and covered only by two buns.
</P>
<P>
   ``On several occasions, I did an imitation of Mitchum's act,
though I didn't always wait for a costume party or bother with
buns,'' he wrote in ``HeartWiseGuy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins meanwhile was cementing his lifelong rapport with J&AMP;B,
researching what later appeared in his novel ``Baja Oklahoma'' as
the 10 stages of drunkenness. The widely quoted infamous 10 include
Witty and Charming, Parts I and II, right on up to Invisible and
Bulletproof. The best line is too vivid to repeat here but involves
forgoing dinner.
</P>
<P>
   He soon would turn out several nonfiction books and a string of
hilariously raunchy and mostly successful novels, including one
called ``Limo'' that he co-authored with Shrake.
</P>
<P>
   And Shrake himself was beginning to demonstrate an astounding
range of writing talents, even more so considering his own
nocturnal habits. Shrake's friends always envied, or at least
admired, his choice of women, which sometimes outshone his talents,
which were enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Once, between wives, which was not an infrequent state, Shrake
got involved with a stripper named Jada who performed at Jack
Ruby's notorious Carousel Club. Jada's erotic act featured a
stuffed Bengal tiger and ``screaming orgasmic arias'' as Cartwright
described them.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright still claims Jada was the most interesting and exotic
woman he ever met, although he probably was influenced by a wedding
gift Jada gave him and his second wife.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 2-pound cookie tin filled with manicured marijuana.

AUSTIN, Texas: title itself. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foremost among Milner's confessions, incidentally, is his
admission that native son McMurtry was probably right when he
declared that Texas hasn't produced one truly great book. That
could be true if one excludes McMurtry's own Pulitzer Prize-winning
``Lonesome Dove'' or, as some might argue, Katherine Anne Porter's
``Ship of Fools'' (her Pulitzer was to come for ``Collected
Stories'' in 1966). Or maybe even William Humphrey's ``The
Ordways,'' if not ``Home From the Hill,'' which became a hit movie
starring Robert Mitchum.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Texas did produce, beginning in the 1960s, was a rabble
of writers,'' Milner says, ``including songwriters, who had the
courage to step up to the plate at a time when being a serious
writer from Texas was ... seldom heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dogs and their buddies ``blazed the trail for Texans who
came along later and dared to write about today's Texas.'' Of
course, throughout the Mad Dog era, other exceptional writers had
been at work in Texas, such as Horton Foote and William Goyen, John
Graves and Elmer Kelton, Beverly Lowry and Elroy Bode, to name a
few. But they were decidedly less rambunctious than the Mad Dogs
and, for whatever other reasons, never seemed to consistently
capture as much public attention.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the Mad Dog lifestyle may have overshadowed the
early Mad Dog offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure at the time people were mindful of all the talent
floating around,'' says Griff Singer, the eminent University of
Texas professor who for more than 30 years has been closely tied to
the best of Texas journalism and literature. ``I don't think we
knew what we had here.''
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee one recent evening, Jay Milner discussed how this
``rabble'' of writers bridged the gap between J. Frank Dobie and
the ``old bulls,'' and the current, bountiful crop of Texas
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't many writers in Texas, and what we had, left,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   An exception of sorts was McMurtry, whose ``Horseman, Pass By''
was published in 1961 and became a Paul Newman movie called
``Hud.'' He followed that with ``Leaving Cheyenne'' in 1963, which
developed an almost cult following among readers but lost its
bearings on the way to the screen as ``Lovin' Molly.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course there was ``The Last Picture Show'' in 1966, which
Hollywood transformed into an acclaimed film classic.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nearly 20 years and several epics later before
McMurtry received his Pulitzer for ``Lonesome Dove.'' The book and
blockbuster television miniseries converted two old Texas Rangers,
Gus and Call, into beloved literary characters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the Sixties, Billie Lee Brammer was bouncing from
one misadventure to another, a tragedy hellbent on happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brammer was the all-time champion of wasted talent,'' says
A.C. Greene.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say he was a tragic figure. He was a dreamer, and
his many friends adored him. They still speak of him with poorly
concealed wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billie Lee had a rare charisma,'' Milner wrote of Brammer.
``Strange and powerful. His compelling charm had something to do
with the fact that he had written that famous book everyone had
read, or heard about, and perhaps related to.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was more than that. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Brammer's friend Billy Porterfield wrote once of reading a
review in ``The New Yorker'' of an F. Scott Fitzgerald memoir
written by his former secretary, Frances Kroll Ring. The reviewer
said of Ring and Fitzgerald, ``Like others who knew him, she
emphasizes his gentleness, kindness and generosity, and his
gallantry in the face of crushing circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Porterfield insists that Ring could have been describing Brammer
``as we, his friends, saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the huge critical acclaim of ``The Gay Place,'' which
centered on a political character strikingly similar to Lyndon
Johnson, Brammer slipped slowly into a hazy funk. There were
interludes with ``Time'' magazine, ``Texas Monthly'' and the
``Observer,'' but to this day, stories of Brammer and his
euphemistic ``heart medicine'' are legend.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, yes, but inevitably fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Lee never got around to writing a sequel to his novel,
though he didn't spurn his publisher's advances. In February 1978,
in his Austin duplex, he died of an overdose of speed.
</P>
<P>
   He was 48.
</P>
<P>
   His last job was busing tables at the Driskill Hotel, where,
when the mood struck him, he would also smuggle frozen T-bones from
the kitchen freezer for him and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, most of the Texas writers made their early
mark in a variety of journalistic venues.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, Jay Milner was newspapering in Mississippi, most
impressively at Hodding Carter's courageous little ``Delta
Democrat-Times'' in Greenville. Carter was known nationally on
several levels, not least of which was as an author and a Pulitzer
Prize winner for editorials urging racial understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Milner recalls lounging around on the floor of the Carters' home
one evening with such Hollywood, Broadway and literary luminaries
as Budd Schulberg, Eli Wallach, Robert Penn Warren and Elia Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gatherings such as this inspired me to catch up on my
reading,'' he says.

AUSTIN, Texas: waiting for.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Austin of the Sixties and Seventies was of course much cozier,
less crowded, not so pricey and, as Cartwright says, the prettiest
and most interesting city in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright remains smitten with Austin's ``rolling hills,
spring-fed rivers and creeks and a laid-back attitude that seems
immune to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Milner says Austin once was arguably the best little city in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Says Walker wistfully, ``Somebody was throwing a party every
night after the bars closed.''
</P>
<P>
   On one such night in the early Seventies, the revelers descended
as they frequently did on the home of Fletcher Boone, a struggling
artist, sculptor and fellow dog. As Jerry Jeff tells it, Boone
declined an invitation to join the party, explaining that he needed
to get some work done in his art gallery to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Walker looked around the room, spotted a painting on the wall
and blurted: ``How much for that painting?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight-hundred dollars,'' Boone replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll buy it,'' Walker declared, whipping out the cash. ``Now
you can go play with us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jerry Jeff recounted the story, a visiting reporter glanced
at Susan Walker for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was $900, not $800,'' she said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Mad Dogs all, and still proud of it, though their drink of
choice these days is rarely beer or booze but coffee or Diet Coke.
They still pop pills, but for medicinal rather than delusional
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Their wasted days and nights, albeit colorful, are history.
</P>
<P>
   Generally in their 60s now, most have ``hit the wall,'' which is
Mad Dog talk for heart attacks and bypass surgery and other
life-threatening episodes. This is traceable to years of exotic
food, drink and drugs and a relentless waltz on the wild side with
the wife or woman du jour.
</P>
<P>
   The article in ``The Texas Observer'' recently touched on this
Mad Dog phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of these cowboys,'' Mark Smith writes, ``the endgame
has been remarkably similar: a ride home from the triple bypass (or
transplant) in a water wagon steered by a good-lovin' second, third
or fourth wife.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cartwright, it was a heart attack. For Shrake, it was
diabetes and a wounded liver. For Jenkins, whose major vices were
Scotch and Winstons, it was triple-bypass surgery. For Milner, it
was depression. For Billie Lee Brammer, an enigmatic one-novel
wonder (''The Gay Place''), it was an early death. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Remorse? Occasionally. Regrets? More than they want to admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew then what I know now, I'd change the hell out of
it,'' says Shrake. ``But I don't drink now.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Cartwright: ``The thought slipped through my mind when I
had my heart attack that at least I deserved it. ... But that was
our time, and we weren't going to be restrained by anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jerry Jeff, a kid of 57, grinning like a guy who regrets
nothing about his long reign of terror: ``We had the longest
childhood of any group in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he doesn't remember much of it.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright, 64, a senior writer at ``Texas Monthly,'' says it
was during his own fuzzy-memory period that Mad Dog was born in
Austin in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrake and I formed this shadowy organization for no
particular purpose except that the Vietnam War was going on and it
seemed like a good idea,'' he wrote in his 1997 memoir-health
guide, ``HeartWiseGuy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We prided ourselves on living on the edge: Some would say that
we lived delusionally, but from our perspective, reality covered
more than a single dimension. Mad Dog reflected that perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Mad Dog remains an ill-defined brood, although two
charter members were Jodi Gent and husband Pete, the former Dallas
Cowboys receiver who wrote the darkly scandalous sports classic
``North Dallas Forty.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the pack were Austin attorney David Richards and his
silver-tongued wife, Ann, who cleverly camouflaged her Mad Dog
affiliation in a successful campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced now and and often spotted in public with Shrake, the
former first lady of Texas joked in Cartwright's book that she and
her artistic allies often entertained one another with embellished
and enhanced stories. But she argued that this was OK, ``because
everyone always had a different version of what happened the night
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaye Northcott, a former writer and editor at the ``The Texas
Observer'' and now an editor at the Star-Telegram, was admittedly a
bad Mad Dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be a good Mad Dog because I couldn't stay up all
night, which was a requirement,'' she says with a smile. ``I had
the right attitude, if not the stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mad Dogs had a motto, ``Doing Indefinable Services to
Mankind,'' and a credo, ``Everything that is not a mystery is
guesswork.'' But as Cartwright admitted up front, their purpose was
a mite vague.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the official name itself was so fanciful that Milner
misspelled it (''Maddogs'') not only in his book but in the title
itself.

MAD DOGS: THE POETS, JOURNALISTS AND MUSICIANS WHO BRANDED TEXAS
CULTURE (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &HT;    _
 &HT;    ``They were an interesting bunch. It was kind of like watching
fireworks.'' _ Texas author-historian A.C. Greene on the literary
``Mad Dogs.''
 &HT;    _ By MIKE COCHRAN c. 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They worked hard, played harder. They drank too
much, slept too little, womanized incessantly, and frittered away
days and nights with mind-bending chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   They called themselves ``Mad Dogs,'' and they embraced the image
with the passion of mildly deranged journalists and musicians,
which they were.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this handful of writers and ``picker poets'' created a
significant body of work, influenced a generation of Texas artists,
and changed for all time the state's music and literary landscape.
</P>
<P>
   What's scary, and not remotely illogical, is that most of the
crew could have been wiped out 25 years ago on any number of
ill-conceived and drunken madcap excursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A van wreck would have changed the culture of Texas forever,''
says University of Texas at Arlington journalism Professor David
McHam, one of the state's top educators and a keen observer of
Texas' creative talents over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Stranger still, most of the renegade writers and
singer-songwriters are with us today, decidedly unrepentant but
reflective and productive, and less like mad dogs than miffed
puppies.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking Bud Shrake and Gary Cartwright, Jay Milner and
Billie Lee Brammer, Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker, and an
assortment of artists, writers, politicians, actors and oddballs
that gravitated to Austin in the Sixties and Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud, Gary and all these people kind of made Austin the center
of Texas literature after the death of Dobie,'' says author and
historian A.C. Greene, at 75, a patriarch of sorts of Texas
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kind of a dangerous group, (but) they made a great
contribution to Texas literature.''
</P>
<P>
   The literary Larrys of the era, King and McMurtry, weren't
card-carrying Mad Dogs, but they easily qualified as pseudo-Dogs
even while living halfway across the country in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of expatriate Dan Jenkins, who fled to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously enough, Shrake and Jenkins were from Fort Worth and
Cartwright from nearby Arlington, and all three were Texas
Christian University grads, which should not be held against that
fine institution.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all Mad Dogs were writers, and not all writers
were Mad Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It just seemed that way.
</P>
<P>
   King, from the tiny west central town of Putnam, worked and
played with the dogs and embodied their hedonistic philosophy. Even
today, he is a Mad Dog at heart. While many of his magazine
articles were masterpieces, King got himself rich with the Broadway
musical ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The prolific McMurtry, meanwhile, was drifting in and out of
Austin and socializing with a onetime roommate and longtime friend,
Billie Lee Brammer, perhaps the maddest of the Dogs, and, some say,
the most talented.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the semi-urbane Jenkins wasn't officially a Mad Dog,
but his chums were, and he escaped only by opting for Manhattan and
Elaine's over Austin and Scholz Garten.
</P>
<P>
   An honorary dog, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Observer,'' for half a century the chronicler and
critic of all things cultural and political, was generous in its
praise of the Mad Dogs and Jay Milner's new memoir, ``Confessions
of a Maddog.'' But Austin writer Mark Smith points out that Milner
prompted a question he never addressed: Do these guys together form
a literary school or movement?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have said so before, but Milner's memoiristic
confessions argue a case for The Maddog School,'' Smith writes.
``Call them The Mesquite Beats: For what is a literary movement,
other than a simultaneous rising of a group of writers and artists
in a given time and place, colleagues who write in a similar manner
about common subjects, and who share similar values?''
</P>
<P>
   By this definition, the Mad Dogs qualify handily.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Confessions,'' Milner tells the story of a 1987 reunion
that reveals a lot about the Mad Dogs then and now. The occasion
was the inclusion of Jenkins, Shrake, Cartwright and King in the
``Walk of Stars'' along Austin's Sixth Street.
</P>
<P>
   The honorees gathered that evening in the lobby of the Driskill
Hotel to await limos ferrying them to a reception. Among those
present were Gary and Phyllis Cartwright; Dan and June Jenkins;
Pete Gent's wife, Jodi; Larry King and his longtime friend Mike
Blackman of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram; and Jerry Jeff's wife,
Susan Walker, the queen mother of Mad Dog Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed to the teeth in blue blazers and basic black dresses,
they were languishing around a sofa when a barefooted, scraggly
Austin relic staggered in the door and toppled at their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``His thousand-yard stare landed on Susan,'' Milner recounts,
``and he rose to his knees and whispered something incoherent into
her ear before a hotel employee scurried up and hustled him back
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The group watched silently as the drama unfolded. Then Jenkins
spoke. ``Ten years ago,'' he said, ``that's the fellow we'd have
been waiting for.''

AUSTIN, Texas: he says. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milner's Mississippi experiences also inspired his first and
only novel, ``Incident at Ashton.'' The book was published in 1961,
the same year he returned to Texas after working as an
editorial-page assistant at the doomed ``New York Herald Tribune.''
</P>
<P>
   While in New York, Milner covered the beginnings of the American
folk music uprising. Individuals such as Bobby Dylan and Joan Baez
and groups like Peter, Paul and Mary were taking their music in a
new direction. A decade later, Milner would participate in a
similar uprising in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime crony, Larry King, also launched his career as a
newspaper reporter, first in an abbreviated stopover at the Hobbs
(New Mexico) ``Daily Flare'' and later, in the early Fifties, at
the ``Midland Reporter-Telegram'' and the ``Odessa American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect,'' King later wrote, ``I believe I was fortunate
to work for small dailies where young reporters had the opportunity
to cover everything: city hall, murder trials, sports, labor
disputes, oil-well fires, state and regional politics, the police
beat with its hard-boiled cops and hard-nosed crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, King arrived in Washington with a newly elected Texas
congressman and a powerful urge to carve out a writing career. When
his hero's political career went south, King leased his loyalty to
another, more successful Texan, House Speaker-in-waiting Jim
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   King free-lanced articles and started a novel while working for
Wright. But in 1964, over the congressman's protests, he left to
write full time. Though he would produce some of his finest work in
the mid-Sixties, principally for ``Harper's'' magazine, he would
never be more than a few dollars from being deadbeat broke, until
``Whorehouse'' pranced onto Broadway in the late Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   ``King wouldn't answer the phone or the door for fear of
confronting some ill-tempered creditor,'' says Fort Worth
free-lancer Mike Blackman, who lived in New York in the Seventies
and later was editor of the Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   King had gotten his first book contract and a $1,500 advance for
a political novel called ``The One-Eyed Man.'' It was published in
1966 to mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorably cruel twist, the first review appeared in his
hometown ``Washington Post,'' and it was devastating. Recounting
that episode in ``None but a Blockhead,'' King spent the night
furiously cursing, smoking dope and guzzling beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it ... really that bad, Lar?'' his wife, Rosemarie, asked
as he stomped through their Washington apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosie,'' he responded, ``it was the ugliest thing to appear in
print since my ex-wife's divorce deposition.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Back home, history of a special kind was being made in the '50s
at the old ``Fort Worth Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackie Sherrod, the Vince Lombardi of sports writing, had hired
Jenkins, Shrake and Cartwright at the small but noisy little
tabloid, and eventually they followed him to the ``Dallas Times
Herald.''
</P>
<P>
   With columnist Dick Hitt rounding out their quirky quartet,
Jenkins, Shrake and Cartwright were proving daily that anything
worth doing was worth doing to excess.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Cartwright's hero and role model back then was
actor Robert Mitchum, the first Hollywood rebel arrested for
marijuana possession. To this day, Cartwright savors Mitchum's
response when asked about life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Hollywood,'' he replied, ``but without the
riffraff.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright also was impressed with the story about Mitchum's
appearance at a Hollywood costume party, his naked body slathered
with ketchup and covered only by two buns.
</P>
<P>
   ``On several occasions, I did an imitation of Mitchum's act,
though I didn't always wait for a costume party or bother with
buns,'' he wrote in ``HeartWiseGuy.''

   Jenkins meanwhile was cementing his lifelong rapport with J&AMP;B,
researching what later appeared in his novel ``Baja Oklahoma'' as
the 10 stages of drunkenness. The widely quoted infamous 10 include
Witty and Charming, Parts I and II, right on up to Invisible and
Bulletproof. The best line is too vivid to repeat here but involves
forgoing dinner.
</P>
<P>
   He soon would turn out several nonfiction books and a string of
hilariously raunchy and mostly successful novels, including one
called ``Limo'' that he co-authored with Shrake.
</P>
<P>
   And Shrake himself was beginning to demonstrate an astounding
range of writing talents, even more so considering his own
nocturnal habits. Shrake's friends always envied, or at least
admired, his choice of women, which sometimes outshone his talents,
which were enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Once, between wives, which was not an infrequent state, Shrake
got involved with a stripper named Jada who performed at Jack
Ruby's notorious Carousel Club. Jada's erotic act featured a
stuffed Bengal tiger and ``screaming orgasmic arias'' as Cartwright
described them.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright still claims Jada was the most interesting and exotic
woman he ever met, although he probably was influenced by a wedding
gift Jada gave him and his second wife.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 2-pound cookie tin filled with manicured marijuana.

AUSTIN, Texas: title itself. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foremost among Milner's confessions, incidentally, is his
admission that native son McMurtry was probably right when he
declared that Texas hasn't produced one truly great book. That
could be true if one excludes McMurtry's own Pulitzer Prize-winning
``Lonesome Dove'' or, as some might argue, Katherine Anne Porter's
``Ship of Fools'' (her Pulitzer was to come for ``Collected
Stories'' in 1966). Or maybe even William Humphrey's ``The
Ordways,'' if not ``Home From the Hill,'' which became a hit movie
starring Robert Mitchum.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Texas did produce, beginning in the 1960s, was a rabble
of writers,'' Milner says, ``including songwriters, who had the
courage to step up to the plate at a time when being a serious
writer from Texas was ... seldom heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dogs and their buddies ``blazed the trail for Texans who
came along later and dared to write about today's Texas.'' Of
course, throughout the Mad Dog era, other exceptional writers had
been at work in Texas, such as Horton Foote and William Goyen, John
Graves and Elmer Kelton, Beverly Lowry and Elroy Bode, to name a
few. But they were decidedly less rambunctious than the Mad Dogs
and, for whatever other reasons, never seemed to consistently
capture as much public attention.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the Mad Dog lifestyle may have overshadowed the
early Mad Dog offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure at the time people were mindful of all the talent
floating around,'' says Griff Singer, the eminent University of
Texas professor who for more than 30 years has been closely tied to
the best of Texas journalism and literature. ``I don't think we
knew what we had here.''
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee one recent evening, Jay Milner discussed how this
``rabble'' of writers bridged the gap between J. Frank Dobie and
the ``old bulls,'' and the current, bountiful crop of Texas
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't many writers in Texas, and what we had, left,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   An exception of sorts was McMurtry, whose ``Horseman, Pass By''
was published in 1961 and became a Paul Newman movie called
``Hud.'' He followed that with ``Leaving Cheyenne'' in 1963, which
developed an almost cult following among readers but lost its
bearings on the way to the screen as ``Lovin' Molly.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course there was ``The Last Picture Show'' in 1966, which
Hollywood transformed into an acclaimed film classic.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nearly 20 years and several epics later before
McMurtry received his Pulitzer for ``Lonesome Dove.'' The book and
blockbuster television miniseries converted two old Texas Rangers,
Gus and Call, into beloved literary characters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the Sixties, Billie Lee Brammer was bouncing from
one misadventure to another, a tragedy hellbent on happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brammer was the all-time champion of wasted talent,'' says
A.C. Greene.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say he was a tragic figure. He was a dreamer, and
his many friends adored him. They still speak of him with poorly
concealed wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billie Lee had a rare charisma,'' Milner wrote of Brammer.
``Strange and powerful. His compelling charm had something to do
with the fact that he had written that famous book everyone had
read, or heard about, and perhaps related to.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was more than that. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Brammer's friend Billy Porterfield wrote once of reading a
review in ``The New Yorker'' of an F. Scott Fitzgerald memoir
written by his former secretary, Frances Kroll Ring. The reviewer
said of Ring and Fitzgerald, ``Like others who knew him, she
emphasizes his gentleness, kindness and generosity, and his
gallantry in the face of crushing circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Porterfield insists that Ring could have been describing Brammer
``as we, his friends, saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the huge critical acclaim of ``The Gay Place,'' which
centered on a political character strikingly similar to Lyndon
Johnson, Brammer slipped slowly into a hazy funk. There were
interludes with ``Time'' magazine, ``Texas Monthly'' and the
``Observer,'' but to this day, stories of Brammer and his
euphemistic ``heart medicine'' are legend.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, yes, but inevitably fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Lee never got around to writing a sequel to his novel,
though he didn't spurn his publisher's advances. In February 1978,
in his Austin duplex, he died of an overdose of speed.
</P>
<P>
   He was 48.
</P>
<P>
   His last job was busing tables at the Driskill Hotel, where,
when the mood struck him, he would also smuggle frozen T-bones from
the kitchen freezer for him and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, most of the Texas writers made their early
mark in a variety of journalistic venues.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, Jay Milner was newspapering in Mississippi, most
impressively at Hodding Carter's courageous little ``Delta
Democrat-Times'' in Greenville. Carter was known nationally on
several levels, not least of which was as an author and a Pulitzer
Prize winner for editorials urging racial understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Milner recalls lounging around on the floor of the Carters' home
one evening with such Hollywood, Broadway and literary luminaries
as Budd Schulberg, Eli Wallach, Robert Penn Warren and Elia Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gatherings such as this inspired me to catch up on my
reading,'' he says.

AUSTIN, Texas: waiting for.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Austin of the Sixties and Seventies was of course much cozier,
less crowded, not so pricey and, as Cartwright says, the prettiest
and most interesting city in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright remains smitten with Austin's ``rolling hills,
spring-fed rivers and creeks and a laid-back attitude that seems
immune to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Milner says Austin once was arguably the best little city in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Says Walker wistfully, ``Somebody was throwing a party every
night after the bars closed.''
</P>
<P>
   On one such night in the early Seventies, the revelers descended
as they frequently did on the home of Fletcher Boone, a struggling
artist, sculptor and fellow dog. As Jerry Jeff tells it, Boone
declined an invitation to join the party, explaining that he needed
to get some work done in his art gallery to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Walker looked around the room, spotted a painting on the wall
and blurted: ``How much for that painting?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight-hundred dollars,'' Boone replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll buy it,'' Walker declared, whipping out the cash. ``Now
you can go play with us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jerry Jeff recounted the story, a visiting reporter glanced
at Susan Walker for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was $900, not $800,'' she said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Mad Dogs all, and still proud of it, though their drink of
choice these days is rarely beer or booze but coffee or Diet Coke.
They still pop pills, but for medicinal rather than delusional
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Their wasted days and nights, albeit colorful, are history.
</P>
<P>
   Generally in their 60s now, most have ``hit the wall,'' which is
Mad Dog talk for heart attacks and bypass surgery and other
life-threatening episodes. This is traceable to years of exotic
food, drink and drugs and a relentless waltz on the wild side with
the wife or woman du jour.
</P>
<P>
   The article in ``The Texas Observer'' recently touched on this
Mad Dog phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of these cowboys,'' Mark Smith writes, ``the endgame
has been remarkably similar: a ride home from the triple bypass (or
transplant) in a water wagon steered by a good-lovin' second, third
or fourth wife.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cartwright, it was a heart attack. For Shrake, it was
diabetes and a wounded liver. For Jenkins, whose major vices were
Scotch and Winstons, it was triple-bypass surgery. For Milner, it
was depression. For Billie Lee Brammer, an enigmatic one-novel
wonder (''The Gay Place''), it was an early death. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Remorse? Occasionally. Regrets? More than they want to admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew then what I know now, I'd change the hell out of
it,'' says Shrake. ``But I don't drink now.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Cartwright: ``The thought slipped through my mind when I
had my heart attack that at least I deserved it. ... But that was
our time, and we weren't going to be restrained by anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jerry Jeff, a kid of 57, grinning like a guy who regrets
nothing about his long reign of terror: ``We had the longest
childhood of any group in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he doesn't remember much of it.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright, 64, a senior writer at ``Texas Monthly,'' says it
was during his own fuzzy-memory period that Mad Dog was born in
Austin in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrake and I formed this shadowy organization for no
particular purpose except that the Vietnam War was going on and it
seemed like a good idea,'' he wrote in his 1997 memoir-health
guide, ``HeartWiseGuy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We prided ourselves on living on the edge: Some would say that
we lived delusionally, but from our perspective, reality covered
more than a single dimension. Mad Dog reflected that perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Mad Dog remains an ill-defined brood, although two
charter members were Jodi Gent and husband Pete, the former Dallas
Cowboys receiver who wrote the darkly scandalous sports classic
``North Dallas Forty.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the pack were Austin attorney David Richards and his
silver-tongued wife, Ann, who cleverly camouflaged her Mad Dog
affiliation in a successful campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced now and and often spotted in public with Shrake, the
former first lady of Texas joked in Cartwright's book that she and
her artistic allies often entertained one another with embellished
and enhanced stories. But she argued that this was OK, ``because
everyone always had a different version of what happened the night
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaye Northcott, a former writer and editor at the ``The Texas
Observer'' and now an editor at the Star-Telegram, was admittedly a
bad Mad Dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be a good Mad Dog because I couldn't stay up all
night, which was a requirement,'' she says with a smile. ``I had
the right attitude, if not the stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mad Dogs had a motto, ``Doing Indefinable Services to
Mankind,'' and a credo, ``Everything that is not a mystery is
guesswork.'' But as Cartwright admitted up front, their purpose was
a mite vague.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the official name itself was so fanciful that Milner
misspelled it (''Maddogs'') not only in his book but in the title
itself.

MAD DOGS: THE POETS, JOURNALISTS AND MUSICIANS WHO BRANDED TEXAS
CULTURE (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &HT;    _
 &HT;    ``They were an interesting bunch. It was kind of like watching
fireworks.'' _ Texas author-historian A.C. Greene on the literary
``Mad Dogs.''
 &HT;    _ By MIKE COCHRAN c. 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They worked hard, played harder. They drank too
much, slept too little, womanized incessantly, and frittered away
days and nights with mind-bending chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   They called themselves ``Mad Dogs,'' and they embraced the image
with the passion of mildly deranged journalists and musicians,
which they were.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this handful of writers and ``picker poets'' created a
significant body of work, influenced a generation of Texas artists,
and changed for all time the state's music and literary landscape.
</P>
<P>
   What's scary, and not remotely illogical, is that most of the
crew could have been wiped out 25 years ago on any number of
ill-conceived and drunken madcap excursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A van wreck would have changed the culture of Texas forever,''
says University of Texas at Arlington journalism Professor David
McHam, one of the state's top educators and a keen observer of
Texas' creative talents over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Stranger still, most of the renegade writers and
singer-songwriters are with us today, decidedly unrepentant but
reflective and productive, and less like mad dogs than miffed
puppies.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking Bud Shrake and Gary Cartwright, Jay Milner and
Billie Lee Brammer, Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker, and an
assortment of artists, writers, politicians, actors and oddballs
that gravitated to Austin in the Sixties and Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud, Gary and all these people kind of made Austin the center
of Texas literature after the death of Dobie,'' says author and
historian A.C. Greene, at 75, a patriarch of sorts of Texas
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kind of a dangerous group, (but) they made a great
contribution to Texas literature.''
</P>
<P>
   The literary Larrys of the era, King and McMurtry, weren't
card-carrying Mad Dogs, but they easily qualified as pseudo-Dogs
even while living halfway across the country in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of expatriate Dan Jenkins, who fled to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously enough, Shrake and Jenkins were from Fort Worth and
Cartwright from nearby Arlington, and all three were Texas
Christian University grads, which should not be held against that
fine institution.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all Mad Dogs were writers, and not all writers
were Mad Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It just seemed that way.
</P>
<P>
   King, from the tiny west central town of Putnam, worked and
played with the dogs and embodied their hedonistic philosophy. Even
today, he is a Mad Dog at heart. While many of his magazine
articles were masterpieces, King got himself rich with the Broadway
musical ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The prolific McMurtry, meanwhile, was drifting in and out of
Austin and socializing with a onetime roommate and longtime friend,
Billie Lee Brammer, perhaps the maddest of the Dogs, and, some say,
the most talented.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the semi-urbane Jenkins wasn't officially a Mad Dog,
but his chums were, and he escaped only by opting for Manhattan and
Elaine's over Austin and Scholz Garten.
</P>
<P>
   An honorary dog, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Observer,'' for half a century the chronicler and
critic of all things cultural and political, was generous in its
praise of the Mad Dogs and Jay Milner's new memoir, ``Confessions
of a Maddog.'' But Austin writer Mark Smith points out that Milner
prompted a question he never addressed: Do these guys together form
a literary school or movement?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have said so before, but Milner's memoiristic
confessions argue a case for The Maddog School,'' Smith writes.
``Call them The Mesquite Beats: For what is a literary movement,
other than a simultaneous rising of a group of writers and artists
in a given time and place, colleagues who write in a similar manner
about common subjects, and who share similar values?''
</P>
<P>
   By this definition, the Mad Dogs qualify handily.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Confessions,'' Milner tells the story of a 1987 reunion
that reveals a lot about the Mad Dogs then and now. The occasion
was the inclusion of Jenkins, Shrake, Cartwright and King in the
``Walk of Stars'' along Austin's Sixth Street.
</P>
<P>
   The honorees gathered that evening in the lobby of the Driskill
Hotel to await limos ferrying them to a reception. Among those
present were Gary and Phyllis Cartwright; Dan and June Jenkins;
Pete Gent's wife, Jodi; Larry King and his longtime friend Mike
Blackman of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram; and Jerry Jeff's wife,
Susan Walker, the queen mother of Mad Dog Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed to the teeth in blue blazers and basic black dresses,
they were languishing around a sofa when a barefooted, scraggly
Austin relic staggered in the door and toppled at their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``His thousand-yard stare landed on Susan,'' Milner recounts,
``and he rose to his knees and whispered something incoherent into
her ear before a hotel employee scurried up and hustled him back
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The group watched silently as the drama unfolded. Then Jenkins
spoke. ``Ten years ago,'' he said, ``that's the fellow we'd have
been waiting for.''

Billie Lee Brammer, Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker, and an
assortment of artists, writers, politicians, actors and oddballs
that gravitated to Austin in the Sixties and Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud, Gary and all these people kind of made Austin the center
of Texas literature after the death of Dobie,'' says author and
historian A.C. Greene, at 75, a patriarch of sorts of Texas
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kind of a dangerous group, (but) they made a great
contribution to Texas literature.''
</P>
<P>
   The literary Larrys of the era, King and McMurtry, weren't
card-carrying Mad Dogs, but they easily qualified as pseudo-Dogs
even while living halfway across the country in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of expatriate Dan Jenkins, who fled to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously enough, Shrake and Jenkins were from Fort Worth and
Cartwright from nearby Arlington, and all three were Texas
Christian University grads, which should not be held against that
fine institution.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all Mad Dogs were writers, and not all writers
were Mad Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It just seemed that way.
</P>
<P>
   King, from the tiny west central town of Putnam, worked and
played with the dogs and embodied their hedonistic philosophy. Even
today, he is a Mad Dog at heart. While many of his magazine
articles were masterpieces, King got himself rich with the Broadway
musical ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The prolific McMurtry, meanwhile, was drifting in and out of
Austin and socializing with a onetime roommate and longtime friend,
Billie Lee Brammer, perhaps the maddest of the Dogs, and, some say,
the most talented.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the semi-urbane Jenkins wasn't officially a Mad Dog,
but his chums were, and he escaped only by opting for Manhattan and
Elaine's over Austin and Scholz Garten.
</P>
<P>
   An honorary dog, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Observer,'' for half a century the chronicler and
critic of all things cultural and political, was generous in its
praise of the Mad Dogs and Jay Milner's new memoir, ``Confessions
of a Maddog.'' But Austin writer Mark Smith points out that Milner
prompted a question he never addressed: Do these guys together form
a literary school or movement?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have said so before, but Milner's memoiristic
confessions argue a case for The Maddog School,'' Smith writes.
``Call them The Mesquite Beats: For what is a literary movement,
other than a simultaneous rising of a group of writers and artists
in a given time and place, colleagues who write in a similar manner
about common subjects, and who share similar values?''
</P>
<P>
   By this definition, the Mad Dogs qualify handily.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Confessions,'' Milner tells the story of a 1987 reunion
that reveals a lot about the Mad Dogs then and now. The occasion
was the inclusion of Jenkins, Shrake, Cartwright and King in the
``Walk of Stars'' along Austin's Sixth Street.
</P>
<P>
   The honorees gathered that evening in the lobby of the Driskill
Hotel to await limos ferrying them to a reception. Among those
present were Gary and Phyllis Cartwright; Dan and June Jenkins;
Pete Gent's wife, Jodi; Larry King and his longtime friend Mike
Blackman of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram; and Jerry Jeff's wife,
Susan Walker, the queen mother of Mad Dog Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed to the teeth in blue blazers and basic black dresses,
they were languishing around a sofa when a barefooted, scraggly
Austin relic staggered in the door and toppled at their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``His thousand-yard stare landed on Susan,'' Milner recounts,
``and he rose to his knees and whispered something incoherent into
her ear before a hotel employee scurried up and hustled him back
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The group watched silently as the drama unfolded. Then Jenkins
spoke. ``Ten years ago,'' he said, ``that's the fellow we'd have
been waiting for.''

MAD DOGS: THE POETS, JOURNALISTS AND MUSICIANS WHO BRANDED TEXAS
CULTURE (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &HT;    _
 &HT;    ``They were an interesting bunch. It was kind of like watching
fireworks.'' _ Texas author-historian A.C. Greene on the literary
``Mad Dogs.''
 &HT;    _ By MIKE COCHRAN c. 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They worked hard, played harder. They drank too
much, slept too little, womanized incessantly, and frittered away
days and nights with mind-bending chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   They called themselves ``Mad Dogs,'' and they embraced the image
with the passion of mildly deranged journalists and musicians,
which they were.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this handful of writers and ``picker poets'' created a
significant body of work, influenced a generation of Texas artists,
and changed for all time the state's music and literary landscape.
</P>
<P>
   What's scary, and not remotely illogical, is that most of the
crew could have been wiped out 25 years ago on any number of
ill-conceived and drunken madcap excursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A van wreck would have changed the culture of Texas forever,''
says University of Texas at Arlington journalism Professor David
McHam, one of the state's top educators and a keen observer of
Texas' creative talents over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Stranger still, most of the renegade writers and
singer-songwriters are with us today, decidedly unrepentant but
reflective and productive, and less like mad dogs than miffed
puppies.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking Bud Shrake and Gary Cartwright, Jay Milner and

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last week many Americans indulged in an orgy of
grief. Ostensibly, they were mourning John F. Kennedy Jr. Yet
people seemed to be lamenting not only the inexplicable demise of a
Diana-like celebrity. They were also grieving for the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The initial shock at the news of the lost plane gave way to a
week-long televised ritual, far too familiar to everyone over the
age of 45.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters were compelled, whatever their political
inclinations, to replay the most heartbreaking disasters of the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   First came the question of whether the hero could survive the
calamity _ whether, as in this case, the impact of an airplane
crash or, in an earlier age, a bullet to the brain. That was
followed by a national wake, with eulogies by pundits and friends.
</P>
<P>
   If memories of the 1960s had in any way dimmed, the networks and
cable channels resurrected the visual symbolism of the decade's
death watches.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers could relive the funeral processions of President John
F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., or stare again at the
picture of Robert Kennedy sprawled in a pool of his own blood on
the kitchen floor of a Los Angeles hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the images of horror, this was a week in which
the various meanings attributed to the 1960s collided.
</P>
<P>
   The week began not with another Kennedy family tragedy, but with
a remembrance of the first landing of men on the moon in 1969, a
feat that was one of President Kennedy's most enduring legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week, the myth of Camelot was ubiquitous _ a time
presumably full of promise, presided over by a man whose wit,
urbanity and ironic sensibility made him seem less conventionally
American than a citizen of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the week, it was possible to recall a
different 1960s. Friday was not only the occasion of the memorial
service for John F. Kennedy Jr. It was also the 30th anniversary of
Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Television newscasts showed the clash of symbols that marked the
decade's confident beginning and its convulsive end.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief glimpse of Robert McNamara, the former U.S.
defense secretary, leaving the service, followed by clips from the
movie version of Woodstock. On television, at least, the last
surviving members of the best and the brightest were meeting the
remnants of the counterculture and the anti-war movement.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shared in the nostalgia for Camelot or Woodstock.
There was an undercurrent of resentment toward the extravagant TV
coverage of the Kennedys, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the anger was ideological, with conservatives objecting
to the idealization of a family and a decade whose values they had
been trying for 30 years to repel.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of the exasperation was generational. On talk radio,
people in their 20s or 30s voiced complaints that they had no
emotional connections to John F. Kennedy Jr., his father or the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   For people outside the United States, the attention paid to the
death of another Kennedy might have seemed narcissistic. The
upheavals of the 1960s were global, not exclusively American.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam was as much a home of the counterculture as was San
Francisco. The rebellions in Paris, Berlin, Mexico City and Prague
in 1968 were as significant as the anti-war demonstrations in
Berkeley or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   America may have been the epicenter of the political and
cultural earthquakes of the 1960s, but the aftershocks were felt
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that decade haunts many middle-aged Americans. They feel
stigmatized by the assassinations and by the carnage in Vietnam. In
mourning John F. Kennedy Jr., they were expressing their sadness
for a once innocent, now vanished era of youthful adventure and
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, then, the disparate images of President Kennedy playing
with his 3-year-old son, the moon landing and the festival at
Woodstock were not so jarring after all. &QL;

<P>
   INHERIT-FIGHTS (Undated) _ Familial fights over inheritance are
ripping apart many a middle-class clan. Six years ago, economists
predicted the largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in
history _ approximately $12 trillion _ would take place from then
until around 2020 as the security-minded Depression generation dies
off and leaves its money and its carved mahogany bedroom suites,
split-level ranch houses, family china, grandfather clocks and
moldering photographs to its baby boom children, a generation
weaned on irony, credit cards and broken marriages. By Neal Karlen.
</P>
<P>
   INHERIT-WORTH (Undated) _ If you've inherited a Matisse, you
probably know what to do with it. But what if you've been left two

tear under the arm? How do you get rid of this stuff _ and, you
hope, realize its full worth? By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   CONCIERGES (Undated) _ Its front-line employees having just
completed a three-month training program to improve service for
travelers, Amtrak announced in advertisements this month that
``10,000 employees went back to school. 10,000 concierges
graduated.'' In the same way that the breakfast roll became a
croissant, even with a fried egg and Canadian bacon on it, the
concierge has become a concept that knows few bounds. Though it
bases its popularity on the reputations of four-star hotel desk
clerks, for whom no service request is unrealizable, today's
concierge is untethered to performance. By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTLAND-MUSEUM (Edinburgh, Scotland) _ The notion that Scotland
is a more beguiling place than the dark and rugged land it occupies
has found fitting expression in the alluring new Museum of
Scotland. In a modern building set on a hillside in Edinburgh's
medieval old town, the museum has a smoothly turned drum tower, a
furrowed roof terrace, slender windows and a sandstone exterior
with the amber flush of a sunset spreading across a Highland moor.
Enter and you're in a luminous castle keep. Indoor bridges span the
lofty courtyard space and staircases and narrow passageways
disappear invitingly into walls. It is a building of chanced-upon
spaces that promise a series of adventures. By Warren Hoge.

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has embarked on another orgy of head-chopping,
decapitating a total of 55 people so far this year _ almost double
the executions carried out in 1998 _ including two women who were
beheaded in public for allegedly trafficking in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Hawa Faruk and Aisha Saada Kassem had their heads cut off with
swords _ after their scarves were torn from their heads by their
executioners _ in Riyadh and Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
   Both women were Nigerian; Ms. Faruk was decapitated on May 28
and Ms. Kassem was executed before a large crowd outside a Jeddah
mosque just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, there have been no words of condemnation in the
West, let alone in the United States, whose troops continue to be
based in the Kingdom and whose oil investments in Saudi Arabia
render even the slightest criticism impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The women _ like the other 53 male victims _ were tried in
semi-secret courts.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually large number of beheadings this year were carried
out on foreigners: they included 10 Pakistanis for drug offenses,
five Nigerians (four for alleged drug offenses, one for armed
robbery), three Indians (two for drug-related crimes, one for
rape), two Afghans, two Indonesians and a Syrian.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Saudis announced each decapitation with a short
paragraph in the government-controlled press. Aisha Kassem's
execution _ ``with a sabre,'' it was gruesomely announced _ took
place after she was convicted of ``smuggling cocaine hidden in her
intestines.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to five years ago, women were executed in Saudi prisons,
sometimes by firing squad, but since 1996, the Saudis have beheaded
women in public, often after Friday prayers and in front of
hundreds of men.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, they executed three women _ Zahra Issa Ali and Bana
Mohamed Adam, both Nigerians accused of drug trafficking, and
Soleha Anam Kadiran, an Indonesian convicted of murdering a Saudi
woman.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, a Saudi woman, Dhafira bin Said bin Mohamed
al-Salim, was beheaded for killing her husband and two Indonesian
women were decapitated for alleged drugs trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a Saudi mother and daughter were executed together _
their scarves again torn from their heads before they had their
heads chopped off, one after the other, by the Dhahran executioner
with a sword.
</P>
<P>
   The worst year for executions in Saudi Arabia was 1995 when 192
condemned, seven of them women, went beneath the sword. There were
96 beheadings in 1996, 122 the following year and 29 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International regularly condemns Saudi Arabia for its
executions and for the mockery of a trial which most of the victims
receive. The hearings, according to Amnesty, do not accord with the
basic norms of international law and are often heard in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Saudi Arabia have said that women convicted of drugs
offenses are sometimes rape victims who are judicially murdered to
prevent them identifying their assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Executioners usually clean their sword by wiping off the blood
on the white clothes of their newly-dead victim.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia regularly justifies these bloody scenes by quoting
from Koranic law, by reminding foreigners of Saudi tradition and by
insisting upon the integrity and humanity of its courts.
</P>
<P>
   In one case last year, a Saudi executioner had raised his sword
over a condemned man's head when the father of the boy he was
accused of murdering stepped forward to pardon the prisoner. The
executioner lowered his sword and his would-be victim swooned to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But death sentences are rarely commuted _ unless, of course, the
prisoner happens to be a British nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Death by the blade is something all Saudis know of but few wish
to discuss. But last week, I spoke to a man who had once flown over
the Saudi desert with the old King Abdul Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost dark and the king wanted to show me a village,''
he said. ``I didn't know why but when we got overhead, it was just
a deserted place with a few stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then the king said to me: `The people of this village used
to rob the caravans to Mecca and I warned them to stop. They didn't
listen to me, so I warned them again. Again, they didn't listen. So
I sent my guards to the village and they cut off the heads of every
man, woman and child. And they waited for villagers to return from
far away. And they cut off their heads too. And there was no more
robbery. If you are going to rule, you must use your power and be
firm.'''
</P>
<P>
   If other Muslim nations, however, think they can regard
themselves as squeaky-clean in the execution stakes, here are a few
statistics to suggest otherwise: Iraq has so far this year executed
208 people, Kuwait six, Yemen 17, Iran 69, United Arab Emirates
two.
</P>
<P>
   Just over four years ago, the Emirates executed an 18-year old
Sri Lankan girl on her birthday _ despite her denials that she had
killed the baby she was looking after in an Arab home.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the United States has executed 59 people by
lethal injection and electric chair. &QL;

   In 1997, they executed three women _ Zahra Issa Ali and Bana
Mohamed Adam, both Nigerians accused of drug trafficking, and
Soleha Anam Kadiran, an Indonesian convicted of murdering a Saudi
woman.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, a Saudi woman, Dhafira bin Said bin Mohamed
al-Salim, was beheaded for killing her husband and two Indonesian
women were decapitated for alleged drugs trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a Saudi mother and daughter were executed together _
their scarves again torn from their heads before they had their
heads chopped off, one after the other, by the Dhahran executioner
with a sword.
</P>
<P>
   The worst year for executions in Saudi Arabia was 1995 when 192
condemned, seven of them women, went beneath the sword. There were
96 beheadings in 1996, 122 the following year and 29 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International regularly condemns Saudi Arabia for its
executions and for the mockery of a trial which most of the victims
receive. The hearings, according to Amnesty, do not accord with the
basic norms of international law and are often heard in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Saudi Arabia have said that women convicted of drugs
offenses are sometimes rape victims who are judicially murdered to
prevent them identifying their assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Executioners usually clean their sword by wiping off the blood
on the white clothes of their newly-dead victim.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia regularly justifies these bloody scenes by quoting
from Koranic law, by reminding foreigners of Saudi tradition and by
insisting upon the integrity and humanity of its courts.
</P>
<P>
   In one case last year, a Saudi executioner had raised his sword
over a condemned man's head when the father of the boy he was
accused of murdering stepped forward to pardon the prisoner. The
executioner lowered his sword and his would-be victim swooned to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But death sentences are rarely commuted _ unless, of course, the
prisoner happens to be a British nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Death by the blade is something all Saudis know of but few wish
to discuss. But last week, I spoke to a man who had once flown over
the Saudi desert with the old King Abdul Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost dark and the king wanted to show me a village,''
he said. ``I didn't know why but when we got overhead, it was just
a deserted place with a few stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then the king said to me: `The people of this village used
to rob the caravans to Mecca and I warned them to stop. They didn't
listen to me, so I warned them again. Again, they didn't listen. So
I sent my guards to the village and they cut off the heads of every
man, woman and child. And they waited for villagers to return from
far away. And they cut off their heads too. And there was no more
robbery. If you are going to rule, you must use your power and be
firm.'''
</P>
<P>
   If other Muslim nations, however, think they can regard
themselves as squeaky-clean in the execution stakes, here are a few
statistics to suggest otherwise: Iraq has so far this year executed
208 people, Kuwait six, Yemen 17, Iran 69, United Arab Emirates
two.
</P>
<P>
   Just over four years ago, the Emirates executed an 18-year old
Sri Lankan girl on her birthday _ despite her denials that she had
killed the baby she was looking after in an Arab home.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the United States has executed 59 people by
lethal injection and electric chair. &QL;

MAD DOGS: THE POETS, JOURNALISTS AND MUSICIANS WHO BRANDED TEXAS
CULTURE (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &HT;    _
 &HT;    ``They were an interesting bunch. It was kind of like watching
fireworks.'' _ Texas author-historian A.C. Greene on the literary
``Mad Dogs.''
 &HT;    _ By MIKE COCHRAN c. 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They worked hard, played harder. They drank too
much, slept too little, womanized incessantly, and frittered away
days and nights with mind-bending chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   They called themselves ``Mad Dogs,'' and they embraced the image
with the passion of mildly deranged journalists and musicians,
which they were.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this handful of writers and ``picker poets'' created a
significant body of work, influenced a generation of Texas artists,
and changed for all time the state's music and literary landscape.
</P>
<P>
   What's scary, and not remotely illogical, is that most of the
crew could have been wiped out 25 years ago on any number of
ill-conceived and drunken madcap excursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A van wreck would have changed the culture of Texas forever,''
says University of Texas at Arlington journalism Professor David
McHam, one of the state's top educators and a keen observer of
Texas' creative talents over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Stranger still, most of the renegade writers and
singer-songwriters are with us today, decidedly unrepentant but
reflective and productive, and less like mad dogs than miffed
puppies.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking Bud Shrake and Gary Cartwright, Jay Milner and
Billie Lee Brammer, Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker, and an
assortment of artists, writers, politicians, actors and oddballs
that gravitated to Austin in the Sixties and Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud, Gary and all these people kind of made Austin the center
of Texas literature after the death of Dobie,'' says author and
historian A.C. Greene, at 75, a patriarch of sorts of Texas
letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kind of a dangerous group, (but) they made a great
contribution to Texas literature.''
</P>
<P>
   The literary Larrys of the era, King and McMurtry, weren't
card-carrying Mad Dogs, but they easily qualified as pseudo-Dogs
even while living halfway across the country in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of expatriate Dan Jenkins, who fled to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously enough, Shrake and Jenkins were from Fort Worth and
Cartwright from nearby Arlington, and all three were Texas
Christian University grads, which should not be held against that
fine institution.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all Mad Dogs were writers, and not all writers
were Mad Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It just seemed that way.
</P>
<P>
   King, from the tiny west central town of Putnam, worked and
played with the dogs and embodied their hedonistic philosophy. Even
today, he is a Mad Dog at heart. While many of his magazine
articles were masterpieces, King got himself rich with the Broadway
musical ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The prolific McMurtry, meanwhile, was drifting in and out of
Austin and socializing with a onetime roommate and longtime friend,
Billie Lee Brammer, perhaps the maddest of the Dogs, and, some say,
the most talented.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the semi-urbane Jenkins wasn't officially a Mad Dog,
but his chums were, and he escaped only by opting for Manhattan and
Elaine's over Austin and Scholz Garten.
</P>
<P>
   An honorary dog, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Observer,'' for half a century the chronicler and
critic of all things cultural and political, was generous in its
praise of the Mad Dogs and Jay Milner's new memoir, ``Confessions
of a Maddog.'' But Austin writer Mark Smith points out that Milner
prompted a question he never addressed: Do these guys together form
a literary school or movement?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have said so before, but Milner's memoiristic
confessions argue a case for The Maddog School,'' Smith writes.
``Call them The Mesquite Beats: For what is a literary movement,
other than a simultaneous rising of a group of writers and artists
in a given time and place, colleagues who write in a similar manner
about common subjects, and who share similar values?''
</P>
<P>
   By this definition, the Mad Dogs qualify handily.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Confessions,'' Milner tells the story of a 1987 reunion
that reveals a lot about the Mad Dogs then and now. The occasion
was the inclusion of Jenkins, Shrake, Cartwright and King in the
``Walk of Stars'' along Austin's Sixth Street.
</P>
<P>
   The honorees gathered that evening in the lobby of the Driskill
Hotel to await limos ferrying them to a reception. Among those
present were Gary and Phyllis Cartwright; Dan and June Jenkins;
Pete Gent's wife, Jodi; Larry King and his longtime friend Mike
Blackman of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram; and Jerry Jeff's wife,
Susan Walker, the queen mother of Mad Dog Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed to the teeth in blue blazers and basic black dresses,
they were languishing around a sofa when a barefooted, scraggly
Austin relic staggered in the door and toppled at their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``His thousand-yard stare landed on Susan,'' Milner recounts,
``and he rose to his knees and whispered something incoherent into
her ear before a hotel employee scurried up and hustled him back
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The group watched silently as the drama unfolded. Then Jenkins
spoke. ``Ten years ago,'' he said, ``that's the fellow we'd have
been waiting for.''

<P>
   Respect. Admiration. Tribute. A king dies in the Middle East and
history is rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan II, it now turns out, ``opened his country to democracy''
(BBC TV). ``He did not put his head on the pillow at night without
being assured of Morocco's safety...he wanted a Morocco where
justice prevailed'' (Moroccan TV). ``The man who modernized this
north African nation and was praised by world leaders for building
bridges between Arab nations and the rest of the world''
(Associated Press). ``The Middle East has lost one of its greatest
peacemakers'' (U.S. President Bill Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   So goodbye to the king who imprisoned his opponents for two
decades without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye to the man who ``disappeared'' his most ruthless rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye to the king whose principal opponent, Ben Barka, was
mysteriously kidnapped in Paris by the Moroccan secret service _
and possibly the French secret service as well _ and never seen
again.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye to the king who seized the Spanish Sahara and doomed
hundreds of his soldiers to rot in prison camps for more than 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye to the king who lost a border war with Algeria along
with thousands of kilometers of territory.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite television contained everything in paragraph one,
nothing in paragraph two. And so history was airbrushed away Sunday
to leave Hassan II, Commander of the Faithful, in the grave with
the world remembering only his help in the cold peace between Egypt
and Israel, his assistance in the deeply flawed Oslo
Palestinian-Israeli accord, his late-in-the-day democratization and
release of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Only a lone French television channel commented cruelly that
Morocco's largest source of income came from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs? The scourge of Western society so often condemned by
Clinton? Nine years ago, Gilles Perrault wrote a book that
redefined King Hassan's relationship with France. The French, he
said, had covered up Morocco's drug trafficking and human rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Perrault's book was called ``Our Friend the King'' and was, of
course, immediately banned in Morocco. The book talked about Barka,
whose ``disappearance'' has never been explained.
</P>
<P>
   So we were left with the whitewash and the pictures. The
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, wept. The crowds fainted in the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez al-Assad of Syria stayed away. He did not want
to meet the new Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, reporters
claimed. No one mentioned Assad's suspicions that King Hassan may
have supported, in 1983, a possible coup against him.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was not a bad man as Middle East leaders go. He did not
bend to threats. He protected his Jewish community and maintained
those secret links with Israel when the ``Zionist entity'' was an
unmentionable state after the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   He was rich (partly courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency,
so Arab diplomats have always believed). But he was also humble;
much eloquence, a true student of the Koran, far too many
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   No serious criticism of the monarchy was allowed in Morocco, of
course. And our television boys went along with that Sunday. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Diplomats can recognize a duck when they see one: if it looks,
acts and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. So why can't they
recognize the Taliban?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, the Taliban have been looking, acting
and quacking like the government of Afghanistan, yet only three
countries _ all Muslim _ recognize them as such.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan badly needs a recognizable government. Like many
another country, it is an artificial affair, a cartographical
concept matched on the ground not by a harmonious nation but by
peoples who have fought each other for generations, and been fought
over by outsiders for just as long.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes seen as a buffer state, it has proved better at
providing shocks than at absorbing them. It has certainly not
provided stability of government. Yet, under the Taliban, something
like a stable government seems to have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are still challenged by opposition groups, their
grip on the 90 percent of the country that they now control is
hardly in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   After the setback to peace talks in Uzbekistan this week, the
opposition is left with the choice of resuming, in due course, the
search for a power-sharing agreement or of seeking contentment in
an extended sulk. It has little prospect of gaining power through
victory on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   So why does the West not give diplomatic recognition to
Afghanistan's rulers?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that the Taliban are a bunch of Islamic zealots
who treat their own people, especially their women, with scant
regard for modern liberal norms, and would dearly love to see
others treated in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries in their neighborhood, notably Russia, India
and Iran, regard them with the utmost suspicion. The United States
regards them with horror.
</P>
<P>
   They give sanctuary to militants _ some would say terrorists _
including Osama bin Laden, who is accused by America of
masterminding the blowing up of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Taliban are ducks, they are undeniably ugly ducks.
Moreover, some would argue that, whatever the old rules of
diplomacy, times have moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, ex-dictators like Augusto Pinochet find themselves
arrested on medical trips to London, NATO goes to war to stop
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and the world is trying to set up an
international criminal court. Morality is now the name of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban may be no more wicked than the Soviet Union was;
they may be no more destabilizing than China; they may treat women
no worse than the Saudis do; but sooner or later new rules must be
brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time. Yet diplomatic recognition need not be the
enemy of morality. Countries recognize each other not because they
like or approve of their counterparts' politics, but because they
must deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Western countries have plenty to discuss with Afghanistan:
drugs, human rights and terrorism, for a start. By all means seek
to win concessions in return for diplomatic recognition, but do not
imagine that all the benefits of having the Taliban accepted in
world counsels lie with them.
</P>
<P>
   It is very much in the interests of all sorts of outsiders to
see the rulers of Afghanistan crack down on the export of both
drugs and terror. And those who preach morality should want to see
the better treatment of Afghan citizens too.
</P>
<P>
   The motto for the West should be recognize and pressurize.
Isolation, after all, does not necessarily breed moderation.
Conversation, by contrast, may. &QL;

opposition is left with the choice of resuming, in due course, the
search for a power-sharing agreement or of seeking contentment in
an extended sulk. It has little prospect of gaining power through
victory on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   So why does the West not give diplomatic recognition to
Afghanistan's rulers?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that the Taliban are a bunch of Islamic zealots
who treat their own people, especially their women, with scant
regard for modern liberal norms, and would dearly love to see
others treated in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries in their neighborhood, notably Russia, India
and Iran, regard them with the utmost suspicion. The United States
regards them with horror.
</P>
<P>
   They give sanctuary to militants _ some would say terrorists _
including Osama bin Laden, who is accused by America of
masterminding the blowing up of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Taliban are ducks, they are undeniably ugly ducks.
Moreover, some would argue that, whatever the old rules of
diplomacy, times have moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, ex-dictators like Augusto Pinochet find themselves
arrested on medical trips to London, NATO goes to war to stop
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and the world is trying to set up an
international criminal court. Morality is now the name of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban may be no more wicked than the Soviet Union was;
they may be no more destabilizing than China; they may treat women
no worse than the Saudis do; but sooner or later new rules must be
brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time. Yet diplomatic recognition need not be the
enemy of morality. Countries recognize each other not because they
like or approve of their counterparts' politics, but because they
must deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Western countries have plenty to discuss with Afghanistan:
drugs, human rights and terrorism, for a start. By all means seek
to win concessions in return for diplomatic recognition, but do not
imagine that all the benefits of having the Taliban accepted in
world counsels lie with them.
</P>
<P>
   It is very much in the interests of all sorts of outsiders to
see the rulers of Afghanistan crack down on the export of both
drugs and terror. And those who preach morality should want to see
the better treatment of Afghan citizens too.
</P>
<P>
   The motto for the West should be recognize and pressurize.
Isolation, after all, does not necessarily breed moderation.
Conversation, by contrast, may. &QL;

<P>
   Are Slavs and democracy destined not to mix?
</P>
<P>
   From the harsh plains of northern Europe down to the bloody
Balkans, from the Black Sea across ten time zones to Siberia's
Pacific coast, Slavs have had but feeble and fleeting experiences
of gentle or just government, let alone democracy.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of communism a decade ago, hopes of freedom rose,
then faded. Two chunks of Slavdom, in particular, have most
patently disappointed: the Slavic core of Russia, Ukraine and
Belarus; and the southern Slavs, centered on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is wrong to presume that Slavs can never be democrats.
Corrupt, incompetent and brutal as many of Europe's post-communist
governments have been, political and economic freedoms, albeit
often of the roughest kind, have burst forth in many places that
had seen none before.
</P>
<P>
   Russian elections at various levels have been a remarkable and
cheering novelty. The young, tough, clever and energetic have
unleashed their creative energies.
</P>
<P>
   And those Slavs who have had stronger and longer historic links
with the West _ Poles and Czechs, to name just some _ are indeed
creating juster, as well as richer, societies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Serbs have been making mayhem in the Balkans,
other southern Slavs (Macedonians, Bulgars and Slovenes, among
them) have been striving valiantly to nurture their new
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that many Belarussians and Ukrainians, as
well as Russians, should hanker after the undemocratic but
comforting order of the past. The change has been traumatic and,
for millions of the poor and weak, for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is still deeply confused. Belarus, a small country of
questionable identity, has fallen under the thrall of a demagogue,
Alexander Lukashenka. Ukraine, with a population of 51 million and
vast economic potential, is a mess.
</P>
<P>
   If the people of those three countries, resenting the West's
seeming arrogance, wish to bond together again and turn their faces
inwards, that is their right.
</P>
<P>
   Though he may be thinking anew, Lukashenka has long sought to
link Belarus to Russia again. With an election for Ukraine's
presidency due in October, several leading candidates want their
country to join up with Russia too. If that happens, the West
cannot object.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a wrong turn _ for the Slavs as much as for the
West. A bigger, yet still unreformed, Russia would be tempted to be
just that much more mischievous and menacing to its small neighbors
than it is already.
</P>
<P>
   Malign as Lukashenka is to his own people, Belarus on its own
would scarcely frighten Poles or Lithuanians in the way an expanded
Russia, with Belarus as its western flank, inevitably would.
</P>
<P>
   The West must keep its doors open to all those Slavs who may
aspire to join its economic and political clubs, especially the
European Union, so long as the prospective members meet the entry
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine, strategically, is the key. Despite the failure of its
economy and the sourness of its politics, it has done well to
persuade the Russians that they should, by treaty, accept its
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia, it should be said, has done well to recognize that
the disputed Crimean peninsula is sovereign Ukrainian territory,
Russian pride having been salved with special rights for its Black
Sea fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus, though less important geopolitically than Ukraine,
should have the same chance to reach out to the West, especially if
its leader's mooted change of heart is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The West should do what it can to help and encourage the muzzled
Belarussian opposition. It should lift as many obstacles as
possible to free trade for both Ukraine and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should Russia be cold-shouldered. Throwing money at it is
not the answer. But the idea that Russians, any more than other
Slavs, are allergic to democracy is as absurd as the myth of their
special soulfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Europe will never be truly free until settled democracy extends
all the way to the Urals. The West must prod, persuade and
persevere. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For those who consider America a healthily
meritocratic country, with a less healthy penchant for political
correctness, the past week has been something of a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   The airwaves and newsstands have been dominated by the tragic
death of a likeable, intelligent young man who was still best known
for his family name and his rugged good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the instruments of the multimedia age have been bent on
recreating the atmosphere of a medieval court, mourning the loss of
a dauphin.
</P>
<P>
   Since the aircraft flown by John F. Kennedy Jr., with his wife
and sister-in-law as passengers, disappeared somewhere off Martha's
Vineyard in Massachusetts, America has seen, heard and read little
else.
</P>
<P>
   There have been exceptions _ notably the New York Times, which
gave his disappearance front-page billing but did not make it the
main story. But the news magazines all increased their newsstand
print runs (four times in Time's case), and television in
particular has been unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   News anchors, the town criers of the age, have quoted tearfully
from the musical ``Camelot.'' Most normal schedules have
disappeared. Media camps have sprung up outside the Kennedy castle
of Hyannisport, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg's house in Long Island
and the Connecticut home of John Kennedy's in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   The saturation coverage is continued through the grisly recovery
of wreckage and bodies, and then on to funerals and memorial
services.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kennedys, a family for whom Luke 12:48 (``For unto
whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required'') has
become more than a motto, this will be another ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline, John Kennedy's sister, has now lost both parents,
three siblings (another brother in infancy, a sister stillborn),
two uncles _ both died young and violently _ and numerous cousins.
For the Bessettes, the experience may well be even more gruelling.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a hurricane of words and pictures? The question is
worth asking because it goes to the heart of many of the debates
about modern celebrity: most notably, the question of whether the
media are merely sating an unquenchable thirst, or are
force-feeding a reluctant public.
</P>
<P>
   Few would deny that the deaths deserved wide attention. Only the
hardest heart could fail to be moved by the drama of young lives
cut short, particularly given the Kennedys' place in modern
American history. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Loeb, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review,
thinks that, if anything, the New York Times underplayed the story
at first. He also points out that sales of magazines such as People
always rise when they feature recently departed celebrities on the
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy (who was on People's cover 15 times) has been a national
figure ever since his babyhood in the White House and a national
icon ever since, at three, he saluted his father's coffin at his
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Without the memory of that heartbreaking gesture, some were
saying this week, his death might have been less affecting.
</P>
<P>
   The main networks recorded a sharp increase in viewership for
their Saturday afternoon programs compared with a year ago (though
the evening figures were not substantially different).
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post, which was still running 11 pages on the
affair four days later, reports a marked increase in sales. There
was also a surge of interest in Internet chat-rooms devoted to the
subject. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, supply factors are also plainly at work.
Kennedy's death happened at the peak of what might be called a slow
news summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Kosovo ended, we have had practically no hard
news,'' admits a senior editor at one American news magazine,
pointing to the recent splurge of covers on topics such as health,
Latin pop music and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   This challenge has been even harder for the squadron of
news-and-pundits television channels such as CNN, MSNBC, Fox News
and CNBC. The long-drawn-out search for Kennedy's aircraft (finally
found on July 20) could have been made for their format.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs of a modest backlash. Local talk-radio
hosts, such as Tom Leykis in Los Angeles, have begun to complain
about spending so much time on someone who achieved so relatively
little _ and also about the fact that much more may have been spent
on finding Kennedy's aircraft than on many others.
</P>
<P>
   Another provocateur, Mark Steyn, writing in Britain's Daily
Telegraph, notes that local affiliates in places like Burlington,
Vt., have shown limited interest in a man who could be summed up as
the ``glossy editor of a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, he argues, a generational gap between the
Camelot-obsessed elderly editors at the main networks and their
younger, savvier contemporaries at local stations.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University
and the author of a forthcoming book on celebrity (``What Price
Fame?'' to be published next year by Harvard University Press),
also subscribes to the view that the coverage has been excessive,
and out of contact with the broad mass of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's death, he argues, will come to be seen as ``just
another installment in the Kennedy family novel'' rather than a
totemic event like his father's death or that of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the princess's death, the most often-cited comparison,
reinforces the suspicion that the media frenzy around Kennedy has
been at least partly supply-driven. To begin with, she was much
more famous than he was _ around ten times, by one crude measure.
</P>
<P>
   A quick Lexis-Nexis search of newspapers finds 3,414 mentions of
the princess in the 90 days before she died, against only 357 for
Kennedy (even if it is limited to American papers, the ratio is
around 5:1). And she was on People's cover 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, the most memorable aspects of Diana's death _
London covered in flowers, the thunderous acclamation for her
brother's speech _ were unscripted events, often it seemed in
defiance of a cynical media. The mass hysteria about her death had,
in marketing jargon, a bottom-up quality. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS ENDS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where Kennedy lived a remarkably normal life,
something similar has happened: ``The queues get longer every
day,'' says one of the increasing number of policemen shepherding
the mourners outside Kennedy's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston and Washington, two other Kennedy strongholds (and
coincidentally two media-industry centers) feelings have also run
high. But in general his death has been an affair that Americans
have so far watched, rather than got up and done something about. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is not, it should be said at once, a case of transatlantic
one-upmanship. By many standards, John Kennedy was a more admirable
figure than the princess.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of her dignity and grace; but these
compliments apply even better to a man who had to live his entire
life in a fish bowl. Unlike the princess, there were few tantrums,
no vengeful late-night whispers to the Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sexiest man alive'' (People again) dated movie stars (who
wouldn't?), but he broke a family tradition by doing so only when
he was unmarried.
</P>
<P>
   And by some standards he was a classier act than Diana. Madonna
may not be everybody's cup of tea, but she is rather more
challenging romantic material than, say, Major James Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the ironies of the current mediafest around John
Kennedy is that the inspiration for it all made fairly sparing use
of his celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   His last ``public'' appearance was at a Yankees game, as a
paying customer. He roller-bladed rather than stretch-limoed his
way around town. His main attempt to capitalize on his fame was
George, a political magazine he started that was facing an
uncertain future even before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, much of his life was spent trying to redress the
Kennedy family's penchant for being, as he put it, ``poster boys
for bad behavior.''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For those who consider America a healthily
meritocratic country, with a less healthy penchant for political
correctness, the past week has been something of a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   The airwaves and newsstands have been dominated by the tragic
death of a likeable, intelligent young man who was still best known
for his family name and his rugged good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the instruments of the multimedia age have been bent on
recreating the atmosphere of a medieval court, mourning the loss of
a dauphin.
</P>
<P>
   Since the aircraft flown by John F. Kennedy Jr., with his wife
and sister-in-law as passengers, disappeared somewhere off Martha's
Vineyard in Massachusetts, America has seen, heard and read little
else.
</P>
<P>
   There have been exceptions _ notably the New York Times, which
gave his disappearance front-page billing but did not make it the
main story. But the news magazines all increased their newsstand
print runs (four times in Time's case), and television in
particular has been unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   News anchors, the town criers of the age, have quoted tearfully
from the musical ``Camelot.'' Most normal schedules have
disappeared. Media camps have sprung up outside the Kennedy castle
of Hyannisport, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg's house in Long Island
and the Connecticut home of John Kennedy's in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   The saturation coverage is continued through the grisly recovery
of wreckage and bodies, and then on to funerals and memorial
services.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kennedys, a family for whom Luke 12:48 (``For unto
whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required'') has
become more than a motto, this will be another ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline, John Kennedy's sister, has now lost both parents,
three siblings (another brother in infancy, a sister stillborn),
two uncles _ both died young and violently _ and numerous cousins.
For the Bessettes, the experience may well be even more gruelling.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a hurricane of words and pictures? The question is
worth asking because it goes to the heart of many of the debates
about modern celebrity: most notably, the question of whether the
media are merely sating an unquenchable thirst, or are
force-feeding a reluctant public.
</P>
<P>
   Few would deny that the deaths deserved wide attention. Only the
hardest heart could fail to be moved by the drama of young lives
cut short, particularly given the Kennedys' place in modern
American history. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Marshall Loeb, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review,
thinks that, if anything, the New York Times underplayed the story
at first. He also points out that sales of magazines such as People
always rise when they feature recently departed celebrities on the
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy (who was on People's cover 15 times) has been a national
figure ever since his babyhood in the White House and a national
icon ever since, at three, he saluted his father's coffin at his
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Without the memory of that heartbreaking gesture, some were
saying this week, his death might have been less affecting.
</P>
<P>
   The main networks recorded a sharp increase in viewership for
their Saturday afternoon programs compared with a year ago (though
the evening figures were not substantially different).
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post, which was still running 11 pages on the
affair four days later, reports a marked increase in sales. There
was also a surge of interest in Internet chat-rooms devoted to the
subject. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, supply factors are also plainly at work.
Kennedy's death happened at the peak of what might be called a slow
news summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Kosovo ended, we have had practically no hard
news,'' admits a senior editor at one American news magazine,
pointing to the recent splurge of covers on topics such as health,
Latin pop music and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   This challenge has been even harder for the squadron of
news-and-pundits television channels such as CNN, MSNBC, Fox News
and CNBC. The long-drawn-out search for Kennedy's aircraft (finally
found on July 20) could have been made for their format.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs of a modest backlash. Local talk-radio
hosts, such as Tom Leykis in Los Angeles, have begun to complain
about spending so much time on someone who achieved so relatively
little _ and also about the fact that much more may have been spent
on finding Kennedy's aircraft than on many others.
</P>
<P>
   Another provocateur, Mark Steyn, writing in Britain's Daily
Telegraph, notes that local affiliates in places like Burlington,
Vt., have shown limited interest in a man who could be summed up as
the ``glossy editor of a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, he argues, a generational gap between the
Camelot-obsessed elderly editors at the main networks and their
younger, savvier contemporaries at local stations.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University
and the author of a forthcoming book on celebrity (``What Price
Fame?'' to be published next year by Harvard University Press),
also subscribes to the view that the coverage has been excessive,
and out of contact with the broad mass of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's death, he argues, will come to be seen as ``just
another installment in the Kennedy family novel'' rather than a
totemic event like his father's death or that of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the princess's death, the most often-cited comparison,
reinforces the suspicion that the media frenzy around Kennedy has
been at least partly supply-driven. To begin with, she was much
more famous than he was _ around ten times, by one crude measure.
</P>
<P>
   A quick Lexis-Nexis search of newspapers finds 3,414 mentions of
the princess in the 90 days before she died, against only 357 for
Kennedy (even if it is limited to American papers, the ratio is
around 5:1). And she was on People's cover 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, the most memorable aspects of Diana's death _
London covered in flowers, the thunderous acclamation for her
brother's speech _ were unscripted events, often it seemed in
defiance of a cynical media. The mass hysteria about her death had,
in marketing jargon, a bottom-up quality. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS ENDS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where Kennedy lived a remarkably normal life,
something similar has happened: ``The queues get longer every
day,'' says one of the increasing number of policemen shepherding
the mourners outside Kennedy's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston and Washington, two other Kennedy strongholds (and
coincidentally two media-industry centers) feelings have also run
high. But in general his death has been an affair that Americans
have so far watched, rather than got up and done something about. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is not, it should be said at once, a case of transatlantic
one-upmanship. By many standards, John Kennedy was a more admirable
figure than the princess.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of her dignity and grace; but these
compliments apply even better to a man who had to live his entire
life in a fish bowl. Unlike the princess, there were few tantrums,
no vengeful late-night whispers to the Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sexiest man alive'' (People again) dated movie stars (who
wouldn't?), but he broke a family tradition by doing so only when
he was unmarried.
</P>
<P>
   And by some standards he was a classier act than Diana. Madonna
may not be everybody's cup of tea, but she is rather more
challenging romantic material than, say, Major James Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the ironies of the current mediafest around John
Kennedy is that the inspiration for it all made fairly sparing use
of his celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   His last ``public'' appearance was at a Yankees game, as a
paying customer. He roller-bladed rather than stretch-limoed his
way around town. His main attempt to capitalize on his fame was
George, a political magazine he started that was facing an
uncertain future even before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, much of his life was spent trying to redress the
Kennedy family's penchant for being, as he put it, ``poster boys
for bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He loathed gossipy speculation about the ``curse of the
Kennedys,'' focusing instead on the family's (patchy) role as the
nation's liberal conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the future a political career beckoned; he was
approached about the New York Senate seat with which Hillary
Clinton is now dallying but said that ``the timing wasn't right,
that it was something to be approached in a matter of years.''
</P>
<P>
   This reticence seems to have been turned against him. Always
treated as a man with potential, Kennedy has in effect become a
blank piece of paper on which countless pundits can scribble their

</P>
<P>
   Until another news story breaks the current cycle, the
temptation for the networks to continue through the various ``what
ifs'' of his life, interspersed with grim footage from the ocean
floor, will be strong.
</P>
<P>
   Unlucky, it now seems, in so many things, a man who wanted to
keep his life private and recast his family's reputation could not

   They waddle slowly through the shopping malls; drive with
exaggerated care on the freeways; fumble with their change at the
checkout tills.
</P>
<P>
   In America's impatient culture, where competition is everything
and the richest man (counting his Microsoft billions just east of
Seattle) is only 43, it is easy to deride the elderly as
preordained losers, to be lectured at rather than listened to.
</P>
<P>
   As Oscar Wilde pointed out more than a century ago, ``In
America, the young are always ready to give to those who are older
than themselves the full benefit of their inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is it that the concerns of the old are the obsessions of
the political establishment?
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years the policy debate has been dominated not
by education, or race, or the environment, or gun control _ all of
them worthy enough topics for most Americans _ but by the future of
Medicare and Social Security, the two entitlement programs for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Is this because American politicians have charitable feelings
that other Americans lack? Or because, pace Wilde, they respect the
aged even as they themselves strive so hard to appear unchangingly
young?
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, the reason lies elsewhere: in the simple fact that
the old vote more readily than the young.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 federal elections, for example, just under half of
the electorate aged 25-44 voted, accounting for 39 percent of the
turnout. By contrast, 64 percent of voters aged 45-64 voted and 67
percent of those aged 65 or over; together they accounted for 53
percent of the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you win the votes of the old and those who
can see old age fast approaching, you win the election _ a formula
that becomes ever more convincing as Americans live longer and as
the baby-boomers move past the menopause.
</P>
<P>
   One youngish Democratic strategist bluntly explains: ``If
they're going to pander to me by coming out to vote, I'm going to
pander to them.'' Translate that into policy, and it means
emphasizing things like Social Security and downplaying tax cuts
(after all, the retired don't pay much tax).
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Democrats can present themselves as the party of
the New Deal, when Franklin Roosevelt introduced Social Security
specifically to abolish poverty among the old.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Republicans are ready to jeopardize the
retirement safety net with wild schemes of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   How well this Democratic plan will work in next year's elections
remains to be seen. After all, in last year's midterm elections
elderly whites _ though not blacks _ tended to vote Republican,
apparently in protest at President Bill Clinton's antics with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case it must surely be a mistake (typical of the
young) to characterize the old as being all alike. Democrats like
to describe as typical the 70-year-old widow, able to get by for
the moment but terrified by the prospect of unaffordable nursing
care and prescription drugs (which are the fastest growing area of
spending by the old).
</P>
<P>
   The Republican riposte usually features the retired shopkeeper,
made wealthy by the stock market boom and hoping not to be
clobbered by capital-gains tax, or the arthritic farmer, anxious
that his descendants will not be impoverished by inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic and Republican images are selective snapshots of
a reality in which the median net worth of households headed by
Americans aged 65 or over is around double the national average _
but in which a tenth of such households are also living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. It is surely pleasant for all the old, so often
ignored by their children (32 million Americans aged 65 and over
live alone), to feel wanted, even if only by politicians and
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle, however, is their reluctance to enjoy being old, to
admit to being ``grey warriors'' even as the politicians pay homage
to grey power.
</P>
<P>
   The old are not ``old,'' they are ``senior citizens''; their
persuasive lobby group, the AARP, calls itself an association of
``retired persons'' (which may be reasonable enough since its
membership begins at the age of 50); their retirement ghettos in
Florida and Arizona are ``gated communities,'' some of which offer
``assisted living'' for those who have become physically or
mentally ``challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense this reluctance is doubtless universal. It seems
unlikely, for example, that the Japanese, even as they preach that
age, wisdom and power all go together, actually appreciate seeing
the effects of gravity on their aging bodies. And no one,
regardless of race or culture, can be happy as muscles and memory
begin to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Americans are surely unique in their determination not
to grow old gracefully. Last year, for example, they paid for
almost 2.8 million cosmetic procedures, from ``tummy tucks'' to
hair transplants, which were designed either to adjust reality or
to stave off the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, almost a quarter were done to the bodies of baby
boomers and their siblings in their 50s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Is such suffering endured in a good cause? In the sense that the
more competition the better, maybe so. Let the old, if they feel so
inclined, strive against the young for everyone's economic benefit.
But let them not feel they have to be so inclined.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans are asked to define the age at which ``old''
begins, those who are aged 18-24 answer 58 _ but those aged 65 or
over answer 75.
</P>
<P>
   With luck that shift of definition is positive, evidence that
today's new ``seniors'' are enjoying the rejuvenating effects of
Viagra, HRT and the rest of the pharmacopoeia pressed on them at
every commercial break in the TV programming.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a less happy explanation. Even though the
advance of medicine is slowing the aging process and extending
life-expectancy, some 63 percent of American adults would,
according to an AARP survey, prefer not to live to 100.
</P>
<P>
   The leading reason for their reluctance is a fear of being in
poor health, but the second reason _ cited by 38 percent of the
poll _ is the fear of not having enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Add those feelings of insecurity to the demographic arithmetic
(the number of 65-and-overs will almost double in the next 30
years), and no wonder Democrats and Republicans alike have decided
to use the budget surplus to ``save Social Security first.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not, if in electoral terms age comes so clearly before
beauty? If the young object, they can always go and vote. &QL;

emphasizing things like Social Security and downplaying tax cuts
(after all, the retired don't pay much tax).
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Democrats can present themselves as the party of
the New Deal, when Franklin Roosevelt introduced Social Security
specifically to abolish poverty among the old.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Republicans are ready to jeopardize the
retirement safety net with wild schemes of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   How well this Democratic plan will work in next year's elections
remains to be seen. After all, in last year's midterm elections
elderly whites _ though not blacks _ tended to vote Republican,
apparently in protest at President Bill Clinton's antics with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case it must surely be a mistake (typical of the
young) to characterize the old as being all alike. Democrats like
to describe as typical the 70-year-old widow, able to get by for
the moment but terrified by the prospect of unaffordable nursing
care and prescription drugs (which are the fastest growing area of
spending by the old).
</P>
<P>
   The Republican riposte usually features the retired shopkeeper,
made wealthy by the stock market boom and hoping not to be
clobbered by capital-gains tax, or the arthritic farmer, anxious
that his descendants will not be impoverished by inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic and Republican images are selective snapshots of
a reality in which the median net worth of households headed by
Americans aged 65 or over is around double the national average _
but in which a tenth of such households are also living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. It is surely pleasant for all the old, so often
ignored by their children (32 million Americans aged 65 and over
live alone), to feel wanted, even if only by politicians and
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle, however, is their reluctance to enjoy being old, to
admit to being ``grey warriors'' even as the politicians pay homage
to grey power.
</P>
<P>
   The old are not ``old,'' they are ``senior citizens''; their
persuasive lobby group, the AARP, calls itself an association of
``retired persons'' (which may be reasonable enough since its
membership begins at the age of 50); their retirement ghettos in
Florida and Arizona are ``gated communities,'' some of which offer
``assisted living'' for those who have become physically or
mentally ``challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense this reluctance is doubtless universal. It seems
unlikely, for example, that the Japanese, even as they preach that
age, wisdom and power all go together, actually appreciate seeing
the effects of gravity on their aging bodies. And no one,
regardless of race or culture, can be happy as muscles and memory
begin to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Americans are surely unique in their determination not
to grow old gracefully. Last year, for example, they paid for
almost 2.8 million cosmetic procedures, from ``tummy tucks'' to
hair transplants, which were designed either to adjust reality or
to stave off the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, almost a quarter were done to the bodies of baby
boomers and their siblings in their 50s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Is such suffering endured in a good cause? In the sense that the
more competition the better, maybe so. Let the old, if they feel so
inclined, strive against the young for everyone's economic benefit.
But let them not feel they have to be so inclined.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans are asked to define the age at which ``old''
begins, those who are aged 18-24 answer 58 _ but those aged 65 or
over answer 75.
</P>
<P>
   With luck that shift of definition is positive, evidence that
today's new ``seniors'' are enjoying the rejuvenating effects of
Viagra, HRT and the rest of the pharmacopoeia pressed on them at
every commercial break in the TV programming.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a less happy explanation. Even though the
advance of medicine is slowing the aging process and extending
life-expectancy, some 63 percent of American adults would,
according to an AARP survey, prefer not to live to 100.
</P>
<P>
   The leading reason for their reluctance is a fear of being in
poor health, but the second reason _ cited by 38 percent of the
poll _ is the fear of not having enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Add those feelings of insecurity to the demographic arithmetic
(the number of 65-and-overs will almost double in the next 30
years), and no wonder Democrats and Republicans alike have decided
to use the budget surplus to ``save Social Security first.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not, if in electoral terms age comes so clearly before
beauty? If the young object, they can always go and vote. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday morning, cyclists gathered on an island in
the Mississippi River near St. Paul, Minnesota, to embark on the
fourth annual ``Tour de Sprawl,'' a bike tour sponsored by the
Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them held picket signs, but the stunning blue sky and a
soft breeze seemed to soften their protest. Not to say there's none
to be had.
</P>
<P>
   The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul ranked eighth on the
Sierra Club's 1998 blacklist of sprawling cities of 1 million or
more. According to the club's figures, growth there is covering 64
acres a day.
</P>
<P>
   People spend almost three times as long in traffic jams today as
they did in 1982, and the miles of congested freeway are predicted
to double by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all this is clear enough. Because cities at the
edge of metropolitan areas, in Minnesota as elsewhere, are bent on
building a solid tax base, many choose to plan only for big,
expensive houses on big sites.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, communities of huge houses and tiny saplings are
springing up around a golf course or a man-made lake.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has caused a boom in construction; in 1998, housing
permits in the Twin Cities shot up by 20 percent over the year
before. But most of this building was going on many miles from the
city centers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the older northern and western suburbs of
Minneapolis, schools have closed at an alarming rate as people flee
ever outward. From 1970 to 1990, 78 schools opened in the outer
suburbs, while 162 closed in the central city and the inner
suburban ring.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers there have to travel to the favored suburbs to
work, thus spending more time on the roads and more of their income
on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Some take ``reverse commutes'' on buses that shuttle workers
from the less-favored spots to the wealthier upstart communities.
These vehicles are sometimes known as ``Soweto buses,'' implying
that workers can work in the leafy suburbs, but aren't fit to live
there.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of groups are struggling to get sprawl under control. The
biggest is the Metropolitan Council, based in St. Paul, a regional
organization that supervises transport, sewerage, housing and
planning.
</P>
<P>
   The council wants houses closer together, with an average of
7,500 square feet of land _ no more _ for every new house built. It
would also like to see housing for the rich, not-so-rich and poor
mixed together and, not least, a centralized, efficient sewerage
system.
</P>
<P>
   These aims were mere dreams until two years ago, when some of
the older suburbs joined forces to wrest control of sewerage and
transport financing from the state government.
</P>
<P>
   That put more than $650 million of state money under the
Metropolitan Council's direct supervision, and made it one of the
largest regional-government bodies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The council's new power allows it to withhold money for sewerage
and transport from new developments in the seven-county
metropolitan area if these do not comply with its planning
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But growth is happening fastest in at least four far-flung
counties that are not under the council's direct domain. There, the
council can do no more than plead with city officials to put limits
on growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also carrying out a survey, jointly with Minnesota
Planning, into metropolitan land use, which hopes to knit together
city, county and state organizations to save farmland and open
space and to revitalize the urban core by creating clear boundaries
between city and country.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the council is Ted Mondale, the son of former
Vice-President Walter Mondale. The head of Minnesota Planning is
Dean Barkley of the Reform Party, best known until now for helping
to engineer Governor Jesse Ventura's rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   The survey will also consider how the state can plan housing
developments around the projected light-rail system. The first
line, a 12-mile stretch from the Mall of America in Bloomington to
downtown Minneapolis, will open in 2003. Later, spokes will extend
from Minneapolis outward into the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Planners hope that the system will carry workers cheaply to
their jobs, encourage growth along the railway lines and keep
people from staking claims in distant communities.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the $446 million cost is expected to come from federal
coffers by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, too, has some proposals up his sleeve, not least
because sprawl is affecting him personally.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura grew up in central Minneapolis, but has since settled
down on a 32-acre ranch in Maple Grove on the northwestern edge of
urban development.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy hovers over Maple Grove. In 1995, the Metropolitan
Council required over half of all new housing units there to be
``affordable'' (i.e., for those on low and middling incomes) but,
by 1997, only a fifth of new developments met the test.
</P>
<P>
   One developer brought a civil-rights suit against the city, and
a city manager was fired for trying to push for more housing for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The city then ended a reverse-commute program suggested by the
council. Only pressure from an affiliate of the Catholic
archdiocese persuaded the city to approve a paltry 19 units of
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, huge new (non-affordable) housing developments are
spreading over the cornfields near Ventura's ranch. Rankled by what
he sees from his own back yard, the governor has strongly supported
commuter and light rail transport systems and endorsed, in June,
ten principles for development put forward by Minnesota's Smart
Growth Network.
</P>
<P>
   These included encouraging development in places already
equipped with roads and sewers, rather than in empty country;
providing a mixture of land uses, which might bring with it a
variety of housing and jobs; and promoting ``the revitalization of
existing urban and rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ventura has his opponents. Republicans in the state
legislature are suspicious of all these maneuvers and the
left-leaning groups that back them.
</P>
<P>
   They have succeeded in shutting down a fairly new advisory
council on community-based planning, and hope to keep their
opponents from ``densifying'' the outer-ring suburbs which,
increasingly, make up their core constituency.
</P>
<P>
   They do not deny the need for some planning, but are fearful of
what they see as social engineering. Let people live where they
like, they say. Do not force them into planned communities inspired
by some New Urbanist hallucination.
</P>
<P>
   As for the governor, a few local politicians wonder aloud why he
is willing to deny others the right to build on multiple-acre plots
while he enjoys his own. &QL;

   CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA. _ America's vacation season is off to a
strong start. With gasoline prices blissfully low, airline
companies fighting over fares and a general sense of economic
well-being, everything looks rosy.
</P>
<P>
   So why do Americans still seem to have such difficulty enjoying
their vacations?
</P>
<P>
   According to Cindy Aron, a history professor at the University
of Virginia, the answer lies in the past. Despite a dramatic
increase in leisure time since the mid-19th century, Americans are
simply hooked on their jobs. After all, neither they, nor their
country, got ahead by being idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans engaged in a love-hate battle with their vacations _
both wanting to take them and fearing the consequences,'' writes
Aron in ``Working at Play: A History of Vacations in the United
States'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``Relaxing did not come easily to American men and women who
continued to use their leisure in the performance of various sorts
of work _ religious work, intellectual work, therapeutic work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leisure and labor remained complicated and troubling
categories, in some ways polar opposites, in other ways closely
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 21st century this friction continues,
regardless of station or income.
</P>
<P>
   Media moguls hunt for deals at Herbert Allen's invitation-only
investment conference in the Rocky Mountain resort of Sun Valley,
Idaho. Companies of firemen from the Washington suburbs crowd into
rented accommodation on the Atlantic beaches of Delaware, where the
talk is of the station house rather than the surf.

   CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA. _ America's vacation season is off to a
strong start. With gasoline prices blissfully low, airline
companies fighting over fares and a general sense of economic
well-being, everything looks rosy.
</P>
<P>
   So why do Americans still seem to have such difficulty enjoying
their vacations?
</P>
<P>
   According to Cindy Aron, a history professor at the University
of Virginia, the answer lies in the past. Despite a dramatic
increase in leisure time since the mid-19th century, Americans are
simply hooked on their jobs. After all, neither they, nor their
country, got ahead by being idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans engaged in a love-hate battle with their vacations _
both wanting to take them and fearing the consequences,'' writes
Aron in ``Working at Play: A History of Vacations in the United
States'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``Relaxing did not come easily to American men and women who
continued to use their leisure in the performance of various sorts
of work _ religious work, intellectual work, therapeutic work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leisure and labor remained complicated and troubling
categories, in some ways polar opposites, in other ways closely
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 21st century this friction continues,
regardless of station or income.
</P>
<P>
   Media moguls hunt for deals at Herbert Allen's invitation-only
investment conference in the Rocky Mountain resort of Sun Valley,
Idaho. Companies of firemen from the Washington suburbs crowd into
rented accommodation on the Atlantic beaches of Delaware, where the
talk is of the station house rather than the surf.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland _ The notion that Scotland is a more
beguiling place than the dark and rugged land it occupies has found
fitting expression in the alluring new Museum of Scotland. In a
modern building set on a hillside in Edinburgh's medieval old town,
the museum has a smoothly turned drum tower, a furrowed roof
terrace, slender windows and a sandstone exterior with the amber
flush of a sunset spreading across a Highland moor.
</P>
<P>
   Enter and you're in a luminous castle keep. Light from
discreetly placed skylights pours down sloping white walls into a
central atrium, indoor bridges span the lofty courtyard space and
staircases and narrow passageways disappear invitingly into walls.
It is a building of chanced-upon spaces that promise a series of
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're object-driven,'' George Dalgleish, a curator, said,
explaining the collection of 10,000 art pieces, personal
belongings, tools and household items gathered to give visitors a
grasp on the Scotland beyond rockbound coasts, windswept cliffs and
baronial, ancestral piles.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are no objects to support the narrative, the story
is left untold. ``We don't want to recreate the past,'' Dalgleish
said. ``We want to give evidence of it and let people make up their
minds how it fits in.''
</P>
<P>
   The building is a testament to the communicability of inanimate
objects, he said. ``We're not trying to tell the entire history of
Scotland,'' he added. ``We didn't want to do this in a
heavy-handed, didactic way.''
</P>
<P>
   Built by the Anglo-Scottish architectural partnership of Gordon
Benson and Alan Forsyth, the museum speaks across the centuries to
the historic buildings surrounding it, capturing them and
effectively bringing them inside as additional objects on display.
Windows frame Greyfriars Church, a central location in Scots
history, where the National Covenant was signed, and the half-moon
battlements of Edinburgh Castle, the building that most symbolizes
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 it was decided that Scotland needed a new building to
show off the largely unseen collections held by the National Museum
of Scottish Antiquities. But efforts to build it failed because of
inadequate financing and feuds over where the museum would go.
Today, it adjoins the Royal Scottish Museum, whose goal is to bring
the outside world to Scotland, while the new museum has taken on
the mission of presenting Scotland to the world.
</P>
<P>
   From the basement upward through five levels, the new museum
takes a loosely chronological trip from a time when most of what is
now Scotland lay under water, through the archaeology of early
settlers to the ``Kingdom of the Scots'' from 1100 to 1707, when
Scotland was an independent nation, and finally to modern times,
when the country played a role in international commerce and
industry, culture and science.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of objects serve as milestones. Among them are a rock
that is 2.9 billion years old from the Isle of South Uist, Viking
coins and jewelry, modern kitchen appliances, 17th-century pistols
from Dundee, communion cups from the Reformation, tattered battle
flags and 19th-century golf clubs from the land where the game
started. Bulking up through three of the levels is an 1861 Newcomen
engine that was used to pump water from coal mines in Ayrshire.
</P>
<P>
   Mundane objects deliberately outnumber the majestic. A majority
excite the imagination more than they please the eye, though some _
like the 12th-century chess pieces, the silver canteen of cutlery
given to Bonnie Prince Charlie on his 21st birthday in 1741 and a
shrine carried into the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, when the
Scots defeated the English _ are stunningly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   This is not prettified history. Sharing privilege of place are
police batons for beating Roman Catholic protesters, a 16th-century
guillotine, leather straps for disciplining students and a miner's
collar _ a grim reminder that feudalism persisted in the
countryside into the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years in the planning, the museum coincidentally opened in
November 1998, at a time when Scotland was gaining a degree of
freedom it had not experienced since union with England in 1707. A
principal reform instituted by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain
has brought regional government back to Scotland for the first time
in nearly 300 years, and the new Scottish Parliament was opened by
Queen Elizabeth II on July 1 in Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who favor outright independence for Scotland seized
on the museum's rich chronicling of Scottish achievement in the
centuries before union with England as proof that this land was
once a robust nation all by itself, and has the wherewithal to
become one again. Dalgleish said the curators were a little
surprised to find themselves in the midst of an ardent debate, but
they adjusted to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the very act of building this, we realized it's a way of
saying this place called Scotland existed,'' he said. ``It's a
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence-minded visitors were heartened to find inscribed on
a ground-floor wall the defiant words from the Declaration of
Arbroath of 1320: ``As long as 100 of us remain alive, we shall
never submit to the domination of the English.'' Linger by the
television screen that replays great moments in Scottish soccer,
and you'll note that the truly delirious moments are those when
Scots beat an English team.
</P>
<P>
   You will look in vain, however, for mention of William Wallace,
the Braveheart of Scottish lore and Hollywood embellishment. The
curators had no relics to anchor any of Wallace's deeds, so by
their own object-driven standards, they couldn't include him.
Nationalist politicians urged them to do so anyway, but they
resisted. ``You're in the hands of the collector and have to live
with the accidents of survival,'' Dalgleish said.
</P>
<P>
   To fill their 20th-century galleries, the curators asked Scots,
famous and unknown, to submit objects they thought best illustrated
their lives. In came, among other things, mobile phones, compact
disks, chewing gum and a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar
submitted by Blair, who was born in Scotland and once played in a
rock band.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   That many of these things would illustrate modern life in Boston
or Budapest or Bangkok was the point, a way of freeing Scotland
from its freighted myths and symbols and pointing out that it
shares characteristics with modern societies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish diaspora, thought to number 90 million people,
helped perpetuate an idealized and sentimental version of life on
this thorny thistle of a land. There were sentimental expectations,
with poets creating a world of noble Highland fighters and painters
turning Scotland's treeless wilderness into landscapes of brooding
romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Scotland sets out to restore reality. Tens of
thousands of Scots lived in squalid slums and tenements in the
industrial age. Displays in the museum recognize this with
unsparing views of life in the Saltmarket district of Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   A display case at the entrance to the 20th-century galleries
offers an entertaining summary of the totems most often associated
with the Scots: against a background wall of red tartan flocking
are mass-produced Scottish curios like Robert Burns mugs, porcelain
bagpipers, miniature busts of Sir Walter Scott, a ``Scotland
Forever'' pattern book and kilts, dirks and sporrans.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Connery was among the Scots who responded to the summons to
submit things that represented their homeland. A Scots nationalist,
he spoke at independence rallies during the recent elections to the
new Parliament. Because he started out as a milkman in Edinburgh,
he sent in a copy of the Treaty of Arbroath folded into a milk
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   G.J. Moonan of East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, made a contribution
that touched on less heroic Scottish behavior. He submitted a
bottle of Barr's Iron Bru, a popular soft drink that also enjoys
fame as an antidote to hangover. Moonan added a fond note. ``This
sweet nectar,'' he wrote, ``must have saved more lives on a Sunday
morning than the chicken pox vaccine.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Two editors of suspended San Jose Mercury
News columnist Chris Nolan were themselves disciplined Tuesday,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, who wrote the popular ``Talk Is Cheap'' Silicon Valley
gossip column for the paper, was suspended last week after a Wall
Street Journal story revealed she had privately invested in and
profited from the initial public offering of AutoWeb, a local
Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said she had informed her immediate editors about the
investment early on.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources at the newspaper, city editor Burt
Robinson, Nolan's immediate supervisor, received a two-day
suspension over the incident. Peter Hillan, the paper's executive
business editor, received a letter of reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury spokeswoman Pat Thompson declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement last Wednesday, Mercury News executive editor
David Yarnold said Nolan had ``at a minimum, created the appearance
of a conflict of interest for herself and the Mercury News, and she
failed to exercise a reasonable level of professional
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   That announcement came after the Wall Street Journal reported
Nolan earned $9,000 after privately buying Autoweb.com stock at a
discount and later selling her shares for a profit when the company
went public.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Autoweb.com is a close friend of Nolan's
and offered her the stock through a legal ``friends and family''
offer not available to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury News' ethics policy says staffers shouldn't make
news decisions about companies in which they have a financial
interest, and advises business news staffers not to invest in local
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said she had no comment on these recent developments,
except to say that ``the action of those concerned speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has caused considerable discussion in Silicon Valley
newsrooms over reporters' relationships to Internet companies, and
it has even sparked a Web site called ``Friends Supporting Chris
Nolan'' (www.fresher.com/ chris.htm).

MORE GADGETS FOR MACS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mac is back. Apple Computer Inc., which was nearly given up
for dead a year ago, has emerged as the most innovative and
aggressive personal computer maker in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has sold nearly 2 million colorful iMac computers in the
past 11 months, and it asserts that nearly half of those went to
first-time computer buyers or people who were returning to the Mac
after being seduced by cheaper but more complicated PCs based on
the dominant Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Apple filled the last gaping hole in its product line last week
at the Macworld trade show in New York, introducing a low-cost
portable iMac computer called the iBook. Particularly intriguing
was the iBook's optional Airport wireless networking system.
</P>
<P>
   But while the $1,599 iBook was clearly the Apple in everyone's
eye, a number of other Macintosh-related products on display added
to the festive and optimistic atmosphere of the show.
</P>
<P>
   XLR8 had two impressive new products. For owners of older
PowerPC-based Macs, including most Mac clones other than those made
by Motorola, XLR8's Mach Carrier G3 upgrades provide a relatively
easy way to tap into the power of the G3 chip without having to buy
a blue-and-white G3 Mac.
</P>
<P>
   It is an upgradeable upgrade, consisting of two pieces: a
plug-in Carrier card that has a zero-insertion force (zif) socket,
and a G3Z (zif-based) microprocessor card that plugs easily into
the socket. A Carrier card and 450-MHz G3Z processor costs $899.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best bargains at the show was another XLR8 product,
InterView, a $99 Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable and software
bundle that allows Mac users to create Quicktime digital video
clips from nearly any source, such as a camcorder or a video
cassette recorder (Www.xlr8.com).
</P>
<P>
   The bundle includes a full working version of Strata's VideoShop
4.5 professional video editing software, which normally sells for
more than $350.
</P>
<P>
   Another great bargain, if a 10-cent piece of plastic that sells
for $9.95 can be considered a bargain, is Macsense's iCatch, which
for lack of a better term is a mouse transmogrifier
(Www.macsensetech.com).
</P>
<P>
   The iCatch is a piece of molded translucent plastic (offered in
any of Apple's fruit colors) that clips on top of the horrible
round mouse that Apple now inflicts on all its desktop models. This
simple modification makes the mouse easier to use and reduces hand
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has an even better mouse for the Mac coming this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The company was demonstrating its Explorer optical sensing mouse
that connects to the USB port on Macs
(Www.microsoft.com/product/icatch.html). The $74.95 mouse will also
work with computers running Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   With its sleek silver design, exquisitely precise cursor
control, programmable control buttons and glowing red tail and
belly lights, this is the ``think different'' mouse Apple should
have invented, instead of the feeble little puck that has earned
the scorn of most serious Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also makes software, and it was offering peeks at its
Outlook Explorer 5.0 program for managing electronic mail.
Scheduled for release this fall, OE5 for the Mac has been
significantly improved, especially in using file attachments and
filtering junk mail. It is also free.
</P>
<P>
   I'm always leery of software that is marketed specifically for
the iMac, because the iMac uses the same operating system as any
other Macintosh. What are they going to do, issue the CD-ROM disks
in fruit-salad colors?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's new Word 98 special Edition for iMac iBook,
which Microsfot is offering only until Jan. 31, 2000, is actually a
good deal.
</P>
<P>
   For $99 (after a $30 mail-in rebate), the user gets the same Mac
Word 98 processing software that normally sells for $350, plus
5,000 clip-art images, templates and other goodiies. And, yes, it
works with all other Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Aladdin Systems, better known for the Stuffit utility program
used by nearly everyone who downloads Macintosh software from the
Internet, showed off a fun little $29.95 program called MacTicker
that places a customizable, scrolling stock ticker on the screen
(www.aladdinsys.com).
</P>
<P>
   The software requires an Internet connection, and the stock
quotes are delayed at least 15 minutes, but for those who want to
track their portfolios constantly, MacTicker is a clever hack.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive software at the show, however, was a
graphics arts program called Studio Artist, from Synthetik Software
Inc. Studio Artist ($249) uses technology derived from the study of
human brain functions to create what its developers call a graphics
synthesizer, in effect a smart assistant for painting, drawing and
manipulating all sorts of digital images, including video
(Www.synthetik.com).
</P>
<P>
   Canon and Epson showed off new multifunction peripherals for the
Mac. My favorite was the Epson Stylus Scan 2500, which will cost
$499 when it is shipped in October. The single USB device includes
a color ink-jet printer, a flatbed color scanner, and a color
digital copier, all in one relatively compact box that saves desk
space (Www.epson.com). Epson demonstrated a clever software
interface for the Stylus Scan that makes it easier to use than most
multifunction devices on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Many other intriguing products were on display at Macworld, but
in the end all were merely the supporting cast for the star of the
show, the iBook.
</P>
<P>
   Although the iBook prototypes on display weighed more than 7
pounds, Apple executives said they would get the weight down to
about 6.5 pounds by shedding extra metal needed in test models to
shield against electromagnetic radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook is an impressive portable for its $1,599 price, and it
is hard to overstate the significance of its operional $499
``Airport'' wireless networking system. Some Mac fans at Macworld,
however, were miffed that it does not have some features found on
other Mac machines, like video output, a high-speed Firewire port,
an infrared port, or a PC card slot.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, this is a computer designed and priced for consumers,
not for business users, who would be better served by the more
expensive Powerbook G3 models.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement over the new computer overshadowed the fact that
there was relatively little other news from Apple. The company did
not reveal its master plan for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There were no new announcements regarding the blue-and-white G3
desktop Macintosh, no new colors or configurations for the iMac. On
the software side, Apple yawned out an announcement of Mac OS 9, an
interim operating system update between the current Mac OS 8.6 and
the radically revamped OS X (10), due next year.
</P>
<P>
   And that is perhaps the best indicator of Apple's recent
success: People have come to expect exciting news and innovative
products from the company, just like in the old days. Other PC
companies are rather colorless in comparison.

PROGRAM HAS LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES FOCUSING ON LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CRAIG 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ To be human is to care for something.
</P>
<P>
   That simple concept is what Dr. William H. Thomas says will end
loneliness and helplessness among residents of long-term care
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a graduate of Harvard medical school, is on a
coast-to-coast crusade to spread his message about redefining care
for the elderly and the role of caregiving in society.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he visited Fort Worth to address long-term care
providers, nursing home residents and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said nursing home residents often leave behind their
community, friends and families. Everything they care for may be
gone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas preaches an approach to long-term care that infuses a
conventional facility with life _ from children to animals to
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to encourage residents to focus on life instead of
giving up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' philosophy is known as the Eden Alternative. It started
in one small nursing home and has spread to 150 long-term
facilities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Thompson, a representative of the long-term care ombudsman
program, applauded Thomas' concept. But he added that many
long-term care facilities and nursing homes already provide a
caring environment.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes, assisted living facilities and even a state
hospital are beginning to follow the Eden Alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Farris, administrator of Peachtree Place, a facility in
Weatherford, said she knows firsthand that the concept works.
Peachtree, which has 59 beds, was part of the pioneer Eden program
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wonderful environment to work at,'' Farris said. ``We
are surrounded by growing things. You feel like you are a part of
life here.''

BREAKFAST TREATS FOR A GLUTEN-FREE DIET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diane Armitage of Decatur, Texas, saw our request for a
gluten-free recipe to duplicate refrigerated crescent rolls and
sent the following note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 6-year-old who has been on a gluten-free diet for 4
years, and can speak for many other parents when I say that we are
always looking for recipes that are fast, easy and tasty.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   PUPS IN BLANKETS
</P>
<P>
   Yields 4 dozen
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound medium sharp Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup rice flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup potato starch flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon xanthan gum
</P>
<P>
   Grate the cheese (you should have about 2 cups). Set aside.
Place butter in bowl of mixer and beat until creamy. Add egg, salt
and pepper. Beat until blended. Beat in cheese a third at a time,
until combined. Stir in flours and xanthan gum until thoroughly
blended. Work the dough into a ball. If dough doesn't stick
together, add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time until a ball can be
formed. Don't worry about overworking.
</P>
<P>
   Divide dough, rolling half at a time between sheets of wax paper
or plastic wrap to form a 7-by-14-inch rectangle about 1/8-inch
thick. Cut with pastry wheel into 1-by-4-inch bars.
</P>
<P>
   On each, place cut sections of small gluten-free hot dogs,
chicken or ham. Roll the pastry around the meat. Bake in preheated
400-degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes. These can be prepared ahead of
time and popped into the oven just before serving.

   3 egg whites
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter a 13-by-9-inch
baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare cake by beating 3/4 cup of sugar and egg yolks until
light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Fold in the milk, vanilla, flour and baking powder. Beat the egg
whites to soft peaks, adding the cream of tartar after 20 seconds.
Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and continue beating
until the whites are glossy and firm, but not dry. Gently fold the
whites into the yolk mixture. Pour this batter into the buttered
baking dish. Bake the cake until it feels firm and an inserted
toothpick comes out clean, about 40 to 50 minutes. Let the cake
cool completely on a wire rack. Unmold the cake onto a large, deep
platter and pierce the cake all over with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the milk syrup by combining the evaporated milk,
sweetened condensed milk, cream, vanilla and rum in a mixing bowl.
Whisk until well mixed. Pour the syrup over the cake, spooning the
overflow back on top until all is absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the meringue by placing 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of
the sugar in a heavy saucepan with 1/4 cup water. Cover and cook
over high heat for 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Uncover the pan and cook the sugar to the soft ball stage, 239
degrees on a candy thermometer, 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, beat the
egg whites to soft peaks with the cream of tartar. Add the
remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and continue beating to stiff
peaks. Pour the boiling sugar syrup in a thin stream into the
whites and continue beating until the mixture is cool to the touch.
The hot syrup cooks the whites. Using a wet spatula, spread the top
and sides of the cake with a thick layer of the meringue.
Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours before serving.

ONLINE ARCHIVE TO PRESERVE CENTURIES-OLD ENGLISH BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Texas, Md.)   (bl)  
 By RITA BEAMISH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six decades ago, the threat of Nazi book burnings and German
bombs spurred a project to preserve some of the earliest writings
in the English language on microfilm. Eugene Power, a Michigan
microfilm entrepreneur who already had begun photographing the
first books printed in English, was selected by the Rockefeller
Foundation and a scholarly organization to make microfilm versions
of treasured British collections.
</P>
<P>
   Only temporarily impeded when a German torpedo sank the ship
carrying his cameras, Power, over five years, preserved
centuries-old manuscripts and books in photographic form. The
printed works from the project became part of Power's early English
microfilm collection, available today for sale worldwide. Now, a
modern extension of the late Power's work is under way: creating an
online version of that same microfilm, which covers nearly 80
percent of all books printed between 1475 and 1700 in England or in
English.
</P>
<P>
   At the climate-controlled vaults that Power built in Ann Arbor
to house his microfilm, crews are working around the clock to scan
the collection, according to Bell &AMP; Howell Co., which purchased
Power's company, UMI, and renamed it Bell &AMP; Howell Information and
Learning.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to complete scanning of the 96,000 works _ 22
million pages on more than 4,500 reels of microfilm, each 100 feet
long _ by the end of the summer. ``It's making this material much
more available to scholars around the world,'' said Jeff Moyer, the
company's vice president of product management.
</P>
<P>
   The target market for Early English Books Online, as the project
is known, is libraries, most on college campuses, which for a fee
will be able to tap into the materials. A half-dozen schools have
already signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Some see a chance to ease the strain on space _ and on floor
beams _ from large, heavy microfilm cabinets. Others cite relief
from the eye-spinning tedium of temperamental microfilm readers _
``a fact of library life,'' said Dr. Richard Oram, head librarian
at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of
Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most appealing to scholars is the comprehensiveness of
the early English collection, coupled with the ability to search
the title citations and sort by author, date and subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enables you to think up projects you couldn't have done
before,'' said Dr. Mary Fissell, associate professor of medical
history who viewed a demonstration at Johns Hopkins University.
``If you know you can do that kind of work, you're going to be more
broad-ranging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Billings, director of general libraries for the
University of Texas, which purchased the collection for its
15-campus, 150,000-student system, said, ``The importance of it is
having access to a larger body of knowledge available to most users
wherever and whenever they need it.'' That is not the case with
microfilm, where a given reel can be used by only one person at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   The online page images, saved in the TIFF format, lack the feel
of dog-eared parchment, but there are research benefits. Margin
notes, printers' markings, typography, illustrations and other
historical markers all can be studied in works as varied as
Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales,'' Nicholas Culpeper's ``English
Physician,'' King James' tirade against the evils of tobacco and
the Thomason compendium on the English Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to see how it really looked on the page,'' said Dr.
Tom Izbicki, collection development coordinator for the Milton S.
Eisenhower Library at Johns Hopkins. ``You can't get to the library
that has the one and only copy. I think it's going to have a lot of
utility for people.'' Johns Hopkins plans to have the online
collection up and running by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The service is not inexpensive. Permanent access to the online
collection begins at $93,000. For year-to-year access, fees range
from $12,000 to $19,000 depending on whether a library already has
Bell &AMP; Howell's microfilm. The company expects to enlist between
150 and 250 libraries and recoup its development costs in three or
four years, Moyer said. The early English collection is a fraction
of the company's 5.5 billion-page microfilm archive that includes
newspapers, dissertations and other scholarly materials _ all
scheduled for online access in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a niche market,'' said Marta Nichols, a financial equity
analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``But if you position
yourself to be the primary content provider of archived information
going back hundreds of years, that's a lasting business model.
There will always be a demand for that information. If Bell &AMP;
Howell hadn't done it, at some point someone would have come along
and been able to digitize that information.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other, less-ambitious scanning efforts, the English
collection is ideal for Web-adept students who increasingly want to
work online, said Maureen Sullivan, president of the Association of
College and Research Libraries. ``The students want to hit a few
key strokes and have it available,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that easy, however, for Catherine Belsey, an English
literature professor at Cardiff University in Wales, where Early
English Books Online is on trial. After three hours of
unsuccessfully trying to call up books from Shakespearean times,
she said she wanted to hurl her computer ``at the proprietors of
EEBO or any passing stranger.'' Her colleague, Professor David
Skilton, had better luck and speculated that Dr. Belsey's office
computer might have been part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Even with collections like the EEBO going online, humble
microfilm isn't expected to lose its place as a reliable
preservation tool, much as libraries themselves retain a role in
the electronic world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly we're understanding that the library's place will
continue,'' Ms. Sullivan said. ``But it will be transformed so that
the information and resources will be available in a variety of
formats.''

   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ The two-week encampment of rich and
powerful newsmakers at the Bohemian Grove is winding down with
tales of sightings of power brokers, presidential contenders and
entertainment stars.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials at the Bohemian Club routinely decline to
affirm attendance at the exclusive all-male gathering, reports
abound that grove visitors included former President George Bush,
along with his increasingly famous sons, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable reports also had former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Gen. Colin
Powell attending some portions of the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Also spotted, according to camp insiders, were John
Ratzenberger, the bar-dwelling postman on the television sitcom
``Cheers,'' and big-screen actor Danny Glover.
</P>
<P>
   The annual event at the secluded 2,700-acre grove near the
Russian River in Monte Rio is attracting a measure of attention
from local residents hoping to glimpse celebrities emerging from
their private jets at the Sonoma County airport or driving by in a
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations at the century-old men's club are rustic, with
wooden cabins under the redwood trees. Meals and entertainment,
however, are anything but modest. Gourmet meals are served and
entertainment is provided by the stars. Guests take turns appearing
in plays and musicals often written just before they are performed.
</P>
<P>
   Protests have been held outside the grove's gates in the past,
particularly during the Republican White House years, to draw
attention to issues ranging from nuclear weapons to abortion that
activists suspected were discussed by policy-makers in secret at
the grove.
</P>
<P>
   The official encampment program of events included speeches by
author and columnist David Broder; Richard Butler, the chief United
Nations arms inspector in Iraq; Charles Murray, controversial
author on race issues and fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute; and Frank Popoff, chairman of Dow Chemical. Also
scheduled to speak were JFK document expert Kenneth Rendell, NBC
sportscaster Roger Maltbie, and Mark Smith, chief executive of the
California HealthCare Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The event ends Saturday.

<P>
   A year after his father died in Florida, Richard Nelson, 51, can
finally talk about what he calls ``the war of the glockenspiel,''
when Nelson, an organizational consultant, and his younger brother,
Larry, battled for months over the instrument their father played
in the Shriner drum corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought like Cain and Abel over that glockenspiel, because
it represented the hours we both waited for him to come around the
corner in Shriner parades playing `When the Saints Go Marching In,'
'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   They had heated arguments over it whenever they saw each other.
``And we didn't see each other very much, because we were both so
mad that we'd always end up yelling about it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Nelson received the glockenspiel, after his mother
brokered a deal to stop the squabbling. ``Larry got visitation
rights,'' he said, ``as well as Dad's complete Spike Jones record
collection and the family's home movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Familial fights like the Nelsons' are ripping apart many a
middle-class clan. Six years ago, economists predicted that the
largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in history _
approximately $12 trillion _ would take place from then until
around 2020 as the security-minded Depression generation died off
and left its money and its carved mahogany bedroom suites,
split-level ranch houses, family china, grandfather clocks and
moldering photographs to its baby boom children, a generation
weaned on irony, credit cards and broken marriages. (The bull
market since 1994 may well have swelled the World War II
generation's stock portfolios and retirement fund accounts even
further.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's a lot or a little money,'' said Dr.
Henry F. Smith, a psychoanalyst affiliated with the Harvard Medical
School. ``Money is a way to quantify love. And both anticipating
and receiving the inheritance intensifies both the loving and
hating aspects of relationships between child and parent, and
sibling and sibling.'' That goes double when what is being
inherited is valuable and tangible: the ocean-front home in the
Hamptons, the collection of Art Deco furniture, even the drawer
full of Bakelite jewelry or Mother's old mink coat.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling will be intensified by other problems along the
way. The youngest boomer is now 35 and the oldest 53. Their parents
are living ever longer. Some children could be receiving Social
Security before they see a penny of inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the benchmark statistical study presented in 1994
by the economists Robert Avery and Michael Rendall, most of the
wealth turns out to be headed for the pockets of only the few.
According to the Avery-Rendall study, one-third of the money will
go to 1 percent of the baby boomers, who will receive about $1.6
million apiece. Another third, representing an average bequest of
$336,000, will go to the next 9 percent. The final slice, divided
by the remaining 90 percent of the generation, will run about
$40,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   For those in the top bracket, ``$1.6 million is worth fighting
about,'' said Kathryn A. Johnson, chairwoman of an American Bar
Association committee on trusts and estates and a lawyer in private
practice in San Francisco. She added, ``I think there is a big
future in trust and estate litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of the population receiving $40,000, she said,
would be ill-advised to go to court. She continued, ``If they came
in my office fighting over $40,000 I'd have to question them about
why they were doing this, if they realized legal fees could eat
everything up, and try and talk them into family mediation.''

   Besides, for most baby boomers, $40,000 is a drop in the bucket.
``There's a good chance baby boomers will blow it,'' said Robert H.
Frank, the Goldwin Smith professor of economics, ethics and public
policy at Cornell University and author of ``Luxury Fever: Why
Money Fails to Satisfy in an Era of Excess'' (Free Press, 1999;
$25). ``Children at the leading edge of the baby boom had their
habits forged in the 1970s, when if you saved you were considered a
chump. Now, a lot of baby boomer families are in deep debt, and a
lot of those inheritances will be fully accounted for before they
get it in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   While some baby boomers are willing to do battle over a
glockenspiel, a fairly large proportion lack sentimentality toward
their parents' things, said Helaine Fendelman of Scarsdale, N.Y.,
co-host of the PBS program ``Treasures in Your Attic'' and one of
the country's leading fine-arts appraisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are much less interested in Eames or traditional
18th- and 19th-century furniture or antiques,'' she said. ``They
want flashy things from their own youth like Barbie dolls or
baseball cards, but they want cash for their parents' most
cherished items.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of sentimentality is compounded when there is another
generational remove, Ms. Johnson said. That is, the children will
tussle over who got the Baccarat; the grandchildren just want the
money. The fighting continues, however, since inheritance is like a
quadratic equation being solved for the value of love.
</P>
<P>
   And woe to the families left with an estate but no will. Six
years ago, Pete Jakowski, 46, a San Francisco artist from a family
he describes as ``mediocre middle class, between the lower middle
and just plain middle class,'' learned that his younger brother had
been killed while riding in a friend's car. His brother had left no
will.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was literally shopping for caskets with my 76-year-old
mother,'' Jakowski said, ``my sister was cleaning out his house _
his furniture, car, stereo, keyboard and everything else of value.
I was still in shock, and she and her husband were doing double
time, completely emptying his place within 48 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakowski said his sister later gave him keys to a storage locker
and told him to keep anything he wanted. ``All that was in there
was his clothes, none of which fit me but which I held on to
because it's all I have left of him,'' he said. ``I come from a
churchgoing family where you'd think this would never happen, and
I'm here to tell you it does.''
</P>
<P>
   When telephoned about the contretemps, Jakowski's sister refused
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there is a will, a vague phrase like ``and the contents
of the house will be divided equitably among the surviving
children'' can lead to years of arguments over who got stuck with
the chipped majolica and who really wanted the Stickley breakfront.
Many of the bad vibes emanate from how American society has changed
since Ozzie and Harriet were considered the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started practicing law 39 years ago, divorce was
a rarity,'' Samuel Kaplan, a prominent Minneapolis business lawyer,
said. ``You only drew up antenuptial agreements when an 82-year-old
was getting married. There might have been unhappiness when the
head of the family died, but in almost every instance, those
differences were worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   No more. ``Now, divorce is common,'' Kaplan said, ``and once the
patriarch or matriarch who held the family together is gone, the
amount of fighting between second husbands or wives who want their
children treated appropriately can get quite brutal. The anger is
astounding, especially when one sibling devoted their own life to
caring for their parent at the end, while the others were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the executors _ sometimes an oldest or
most-trusted child (a position of honor that can lead to more
family friction), otherwise a banker, lawyer or family adviser.
Perhaps the shrillest battle over executors this decade concerned
the estate of Joe Robbie, a Miami businessman and owner of the
Miami Dolphins who named three of his children as trustees of his
estate without informing his six other children they wouldn't have
direct control of their inheritance. After his death in 1990, a
five-year battle was waged in court for control of the $72 million
estate, with the three trustees ultimately dismissing the oldest
son from the family businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the money, childhood notions of fairness seem to lurk
behind many siblings' anger.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid battles over who gets what, Morris Everett, 58, the
owner of one of the largest accumulation of movie posters in the
world, has chosen to get rid of his collection before he dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be more of a burden to my family than an asset to
pass it on,'' he said of his 200,000-piece collection, worth $8
million to $10 million and housed in Cleveland. ``It represents
dollar signs for my son and daughter, so it's my job to maximize
the dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the emotional investment he made in a hobby that
he started in 1961 with a lobby card for ``Gunga Din'' that he
bought for 50 cents? ``The joy of collecting is in the discovery,''
Everett said. ``The worst thing to do is get handed a great
collection. To just lay on my children this massive responsibility
would be unfair.''

 UNDATED: be unfair.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not every family ends up fighting over stuff. Some siblings even
meet while their parents are alive and divide things up for later.
``You can horse trade,'' said Steven Greenberg, owner of a computer
company called Designstein in Minneapolis, who used this system
with his two siblings. ``I'd say, `I'll trade you my next two picks
for mom's glass sugar bowl' _ and the system worked.''
</P>
<P>
   But baby boomers _ conspicuous consumers _ may not have any room
left in their houses for the odd parental keepsake. And the items
to be inherited have to be to their taste. The Nelson brothers who
warred over their father's glockenspiel were not at all interested
in his white polyester pants. ``My mother begged me to take a
number of sentimental things, which I did out of respect,'' Nelson
said. ``But they never got out of the car before they went to
Goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no squabbling over their father's 50 bowling trophies,
which their mother insisted they have. ``To us they symbolized all
the time he didn't spend with us,'' he said. ``After we were done
grieving, Larry and I took great pleasure in throwing them into the
dumpster one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, it's the baby boomer who wants to preserve
the past. Art Simon, 40, an assistant professor of film studies at
New Jersey's Montclair State University, refused to let his father
sell the five-foot-tall wood-block printing press from the 1940s
that once made window signs announcing sales in the family's
clothing store in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably only worth a couple hundred dollars, if I could
even find someone to buy it,'' Simon said. ``But it was part of my
family's history.''
</P>
<P>
   When his father died in 1996, Simon refused to put the printing
press in the family's estate sale. Instead, he drove cross-country
with the thing in the back of his car. ``Now it's in storage,'' he
said, ``just like my dad had it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment beyond dollars and cents that Ms. Fendelman,
the appraiser, would applaud. ``Whether you get an objet, or objet
d'art, consider yourself lucky,'' she said. She tells clients,
``The one thing no one can take from you is your memories.''

<P>
   TIPS FOR DIVIDING FAMILY HEIRLOOMS
</P>
<P>
   Settling which family members receive which family treasures is,
like anything important, best done yesterday, worst done tomorrow
and, if not done yet, should be done today.
</P>
<P>
   Some tips for the children:
</P>
<P>
   _ If parents are still alive, gather the siblings with them to
discuss what to do when they die and _ if not the specifics of
their assets, the mechanism by which those assets will be
distributed. ``Sex is pretty easy to talk about these days,'' Dr.
Henry F. Smith, a psychoanalyst in Cambridge, Mass., said. ``But
money is taboo.'' It will take effort to overcome everyone's
reticence, but a candid discussion will make things easier later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Failing that, if a parent dies without leaving a clear
indication of who gets what, hold a draft. Gather all the siblings
in one room with every item to be divided up. Any gift given by a
child to a parent automatically reverts to that sibling. Then
proceed down the line from oldest to youngest, with the children
taking turns putting Post-it notes on items they are claiming.
Prepare to horse trade.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even if there is little or no value to an estate, make sure
parents and siblings are aware of the one item that means the most
to you. ``Be generous of spirit,'' said Mike Veeck, one of nine
children of Bill Veeck, the Baseball Hall of Fame team owner and
promoter who died in 1986 leaving little money but a lifetime of
good karma. Mike Veeck wanted an oil portrait showing his father
sitting in a bar. So did some of the other children. ``But I'm from
Chicago,'' he said, ``so I called up mom and fixed it, like a
closed election.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tips for the parents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Helaine Fendelman, a fine-arts appraiser, advises parents to
learn the value of items, from abandoned G.I. Joe dolls to
fireplace andirons, and if they have any chance of being worth
something. ``A lot of parents leave messes for their children,''
she said. ``And that's not a very nice thing to do when they're
dealing with the loss of a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Take an extension course in estate planning that goes beyond
mere dollars. Ann Barrash, 75, a Dubuque, Iowa, mother of six,
attended a special class for women sponsored by the American
Association of Retired Persons at Iowa State. ``I was advised that
every child would be fighting over this and that after we were
gone,'' she said, so she and her husband, Meyer, 76, a retired
physician, made a list of every item they owned, circulated it
among the kids, and made the children prioritize their choices.
``It takes a long time but it really worked,'' she said, ``because
we didn't decide for them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have an estate large enough to be subject to the estate
tax _ any amount above $650,000 for one person or $1.3 million for
a married couple _ then before you die or become incapacitated you
should hire an estate lawyer to work out what to do. An estate
lawyer can show you ways to combine charitable gifts and insurance,
for example, to pass on more to heirs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Serious collections may be sold now and money passed on to the
children. If the collection remains intact, leave detailed
instructions on how it should be disposed of and through which
experts, so the children will not have to hold a fire sale.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give items to children now, up to the $10,000 tax-free limit a
year per parent. If a daughter needs a dining room table today, why
wait?
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a will. And include every single thing you own in it.
</P>
<P>

NO BETTER TIME TO GET SOME LOO-ZIANA COOKIN' UNDER YOUR BELT

<TEXT>
<P>
   As we passed over the Sabine River from Texas into Louisiana, my
tongue floated away in my mouth. We were in the mother country.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't born in Louisiana, don't have any relatives living
there that I know of, can't speak a lick of French. I don't even
eat french fries very often. I once tried to fix my daughter's hair
in a French braid, but she said it didn't look right. I thought it
was fine.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a spiritual connection between me and the food that
is consumed under the spreading oaks and pendant Spanish moss of
southern Louisiana. It is Cajun food _ country cooking with a
little extra spice and ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I set up camp in Lafayette. Actually, we set up camp
in a Best Western and took day trips in and around the heart of
Acadiana _ the southwest Louisiana area where the Acadians, or
Cajuns, settled after they were kicked out of Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cajuns spread across southern Louisiana, they blended
their culture with that of the Spanish, German, Creole and other
French influences already present.
</P>
<P>
   The result was really good crawfish etouffee.
</P>
<P>
   The Cajuns say the crawfish were once lobsters that followed
them to Louisiana and lost a bit of their size, but none of their
taste, along the way.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not surrendering my chicken-fried steak recipes or my
penchant for Texas barbecue, but I can say that eating your way
across Acadiana is not a bad way to spend a few vacation days.
</P>
<P>
   The people there love their food. They celebrate it, and each
and every small-town grocery store has its own homemade version of
boudin, andouille sausage, tasso and hogshead cheese.
</P>
<P>
   That last little item can cause an involuntary gag at the meat
counter, but it really is safe and tasty. Hogshead cheese has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, when families gathered for a ``boucherie'' _ or
hog killin' in less-delicate terms _ everything was used. The meat
was cut into chops and hams and roasts, the fat fried into
cracklins', the blood saved for boudin rouge, and the head and feet
used for hogshead cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, meat markets use lean pork _ cooked slowly for as much
as eight hours _ to make the head cheese. There are no nasty snouts
or jowls in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   We sampled the hogshead cheese in Breaux Bridge, had wonderful
po-boy sandwiches in Church Point, and loaded the cooler with
locally made boudin from the Best Stop Grocery and Meat Market just
north of Scott.
</P>
<P>
   At Prejean's Restaurant in Lafayette, I learned that a rich,
flavorful gumbo can be made without spices that burn your mouth,
then cruelly water your eyes. I sampled dirty rice that was moist
and meaty.
</P>
<P>
   I had brown jambalaya in Vermilionville, a re-created Acadian
village complete with tour guides and a restaurant. The brown
jambalaya is common in parts of southern Louisiana. It has no
tomatoes or tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   At Avery Island, just outside New Iberia, we toured the Tabasco
plant. In town, we saw how the Conrad Rice Co. processes rice into
its Konriko products.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana is proud of its food, its Cajun and Creole influences.
And best of all, the state is willing to share.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the state is celebrating 300 years of French culture
with Francofete '99. Southwest Louisiana is hosting ``Congres
Mondial Acadien _ Louisiane,'' a gathering of Cajuns from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good time to cross the Sabine. Louisiana has its food
and culture on display.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a recipe offered by Konriko brand rice; it uses Konriko
wild pecan rice, but other kinds of rice will do.

WHEN THE CHINA SWANS AND CELERY DISHES JUST HAVE TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INHERIT-FIGHTS) 
(js) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you've inherited a Matisse, you probably know what
to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you've been left two cardboard cartons full of cut
glass ashtrays and celery dishes? A vintage 1947 Lionel train set?
A Russian sable _ with only a small tear under the arm?
</P>
<P>
   How do you get rid of this stuff _ and, you hope, realize its
full worth?
</P>
<P>
   At first, it may strike you as easy: just call up that
antique-dealer friend, the one who's always telling you how much
money she'll give you if you ever decide to part with your
great-aunt's possessions.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly she isn't returning your calls. Or when she does,
she wants to give you $10 a boxload of crystal. You visit the
nearby consignment shops, but they take 50 percent, and you see the
dust motes gathering behind the Waterford decanters they already
have. (And yours isn't even Waterford.)
</P>
<P>
   The experts _ appraisers and estate lawyers _ say there are two
tried-and-true ways to get rid of a lot of stuff you don't want:
auctions and house sales.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your own house or estate sale unless you really know
what you're doing. It's a lot of work to price all the objects, and
do you really know what they're worth? Generally speaking, it's
better to let a qualified house-sale company hire the necessary
staff, unpack and price the stuff, sell it and, perhaps most
important, get rid of the leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   But which approach to select?
</P>
<P>
   House Sales
</P>
<P>
   _ First you need a house. (Co-op boards frown on apartment sales
because of the traffic; they really don't like strangers wandering
around the halls.) It's better if it's the house of the person who
died, rather than your own, because if you're going to be hauling
the stuff around, you may as well move it all directly to an
auction house. And the more charming and classy the home, the more
money you'll get for the items, said Joneen Connor, the proprietor
of Serendipity Estate Sales in Fairfield, Conn., a business that
arranges house sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many people, part of the allure is the magical mystery
tour they get of the house,'' she said. ``They love poking in the
closets, seeing everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At one house sale in Westbrook, Conn., at a gorgeous 1760
Georgian mansion, cheap newish white china swans that cost about
$10 each were selling for $125, strictly because they were owned by
the well-known antiques collector who had owned the house _ and who
had just passed away. At a sale at Castle Howard in England, ripped
draperies went for more than $1,000 _ because they came from a
castle.
</P>
<P>
   But those may be exceptions. At your run-of-the-mill estate
sale, you get a lot of cheap people who will pick up an oil
painting marked $3 and offer $2 (and then put it down, and go
peeking in the closets).
</P>
<P>
   And not every house is chosen. Most house-sale professionals set
a minimum: Ms. Connor usually likes to see between $8,000 and
$10,000 worth of objects. They can be almost anything; a recent
estate sale in Darien, Conn., advertised ``a former milliners'
cache of vintage hats,'' hat blocks, Depression glass, iron patio
chairs, an old violin and a lawn mower, among dozens of things.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of a house sale is that you can get rid of
items that few self-respecting auctioneers would accept: everything
from the whistling tea kettle to old tires in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the disadvantages is that the house becomes a circus,
with staff members coming and going, followed by hordes of
customers who leave ruts in the lawn and line up outside hours
before the doors open, clutching their admittance numbers and
getting into arguments about who shoved whom.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, estate-sales companies take a percentage of the gross
sales; the average seems to be 25 percent. This figure usually
includes paying all the staff, but some companies charge extra for
the advertising. So, be sure to check.
</P>
<P>
   House-sales specialists don't always advertise in the Yellow
Pages, but try scanning the listings under ``Tag Sale Services.''
Look in your local newspaper or those shopping gazettes in the
supermarket for upcoming house sales, and call the people who are
holding them.
</P>
<P>
   But Helaine Fendelman, who holds house sales in the suburbs
north of New York, said that she gets 99 percent of her customers
through word of mouth. So, check with your friends, too.

   Auctions
</P>
<P>
   _ Now, it's clear that neither Sotheby's nor Christie's is going
to be rushing to take those Lionel trains off your hands. Or the
mink. But there are plenty of auction houses that will, especially
if they come with a house full of other once-cherished possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Manhattan, the Tepper Gallery, an auction house on East
25th Street, said it would take those two cartons of cut glass _
but you'd have to bring them in yourself if that's all you have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd take them _ but it's not exactly what I'm looking for,''
Kenneth Hutter, an owner, said. What is he looking for? ``Big
estates with lots of Picassos.'' Fine, but he'd still take the cut
glass.
</P>
<P>
   He'd even send an appraiser to look at your newly inherited
objects. But only if you have an address he respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say you live at 960 Fifth Avenue, I'd probably go,''
Hutter said. ``Anything between 59th and 96th Street we might go to
see. But if you call from East Ozone Park, we might tell you to
send a picture! We're not going out to look at one slant-front desk
that's probably only 40 or 50 years old, even if you think it's an
antique.''
</P>
<P>
   In the country, there are dozens of auction houses that would be
happy to clean out your house _ but most of them wouldn't do so if
they thought that you'd already had a house sale. They'd think the
house had been ``picked.'' Check the telephone book, or look in
Antiques and the Arts Weekly, which lists upcoming local auctions
throughout the Northeast by date, on page 66. (House sales appear
in the pages before that.) Information: (203) 426-3141 or
www.thebee.com.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of an auction is that you get rid of the stuff,
and with a lot of people bidding against each other, you often get
pretty fair prices. There are no ``backsies''; it's difficult to
take anything back, so make sure the relatives have had their pick
_ or tell them to go and bid. (The only way you would get anything
back is if you were to leave a reserve on the best of the items.
But most small-time auctioneers won't accept reserves, so figure
this in when you pick your auctioneer. Big-name auctioneers pick
and choose; they won't take the train sets or the mink, for sure.)
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage is that you can't control the prices. (Oriental
rug dealers, for example, tend to bid as a team and then conduct
their own auction out in the parking lot later. Faced with such a
cabal, the average customer usually doesn't bid, or drops out
quickly _ which is the whole strategy behind the rings.) Even if
there's no ring of dealers trying to keep prices down, you may hit
a bad day: a snowstorm or a holiday or a night when there's a
bigger auction somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Auctioneers usually take between 15 percent and 20 percent of
the total income from a sale. For their percentage, they run ads
and hold exhibitions. In the country, they usually don't charge to
pick up possessions if there are enough of them. In the city, they
usually do, Hutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the experts say you probably want to choose a method
of liquidation that leaves you with nothing but the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can try selling the stuff off through Ebay or by driving
it around to a lot of dealers,'' said Robert M. Kneeland, a retired
Connecticut antiques dealer, who said he spends more and more time
advising friends on how to clear their attics of things they have
inherited. ``But getting rid of it piecemeal like that can take you
the rest of your life. We all have better things to do.''

<P>
   One recent Friday evening, an employee in a small New York
new-media company enjoyed his own private screening of ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' The film's sound fell somewhere
between hollow and muffled. The picture, washed out and slightly
murky, looked like a videotape copy of a public access television
show.
</P>
<P>
   But the one-man audience wasn't too disappointed, considering
that he didn't pay to see the film in a theater; he had downloaded
and played a pirate version on his desktop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to see this in the theater _ it's funny, but not
that funny,'' said the employee, who asked that his name not be
used because, by downloading an illegal copy of a the film, he is
breaking copyright laws. He added that he didn't enjoy the ``Austin
Powers'' sequel as much as other films he had obtained illegally.
</P>
<P>
   What made his private screenings possible was MPEG, a digital
file format for compressing and playing video and audio that could
be to the movie industry was the MP3 format was to the recording
industry. MPEG (named for the Motion Picture Experts Group, which
developed it) also makes it possible to swap video files, including
illegally copied versions of current films, over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MPEG's of pirated films are created from illegally obtained
copies; the digitized files can then be played on a computer with
MPEG-player software like Quicktime or Windows Media Player and
``burned'' on a recordable disk called a VCD, which can be played
on a DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   Movies like ``Summer of Sam,'' ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and ``American
Pie'' have been made available on line within days and sometimes
hours of their release. (Pirates also swap online copies of films
that have been released on video or DVD, although they are less
popular than first-run films.)
</P>
<P>
   Some films, like ``The Blair Witch Project,'' appeared illegally
on the Internet before being released in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   MPEG technology is obviously of great interest to Hollywood. The
Internet aside, movie pirating costs the seven major American movie
studios about $250 million domestically and $2 billion to $3
billion internationally. The Net could add a lot to the tally as
cable modems and other high-speed connections become more
plentiful, making the proliferation of illegal video copies easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that movies can be disseminated digitally on the
Internet, illegally, is a serious concern,'' said Gordon Radley,
president of Lucasfilm, producers of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace,'' perhaps the most widely pirated film to date.
``Our copyright laws have been there since the time of the
Constitution. Just because there's a new technological advancement
doesn't change things in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a lesson from the music industry's initial
caught-in-the-headlights approach to MP3, the Motion Picture
Association of America plans to move quickly to stop the illicit
trading. For the most part, MPEG pirates are not making money from
putting films on the Internet. They do it for one-upmanship and
bragging rights. Web sites like ISO News (www.isonews.com) and
Dupecheck (www.dupecheck.com) review the pirates' releases and
gossip about their exploits as if they were celebrities (the sites
do not offer pirated material for downloading).
</P>
<P>
   No hard figures exist on the number of pirated films or the
pirates who make them. According to the founder of Dupecheck (who
goes by the on-screen name Werner &AMP; Tardy), there are 2,000 to
2,500 ``elite'' traders _ pirates who regularly upload and trade
films. But the Dupecheck site itself is now receiving as many as
30,000 hits a day, which could be a sign that interest in online
film copies is set to explode.
</P>
<P>
   And as with MP3, video piracy could expand from a geek hobby to
a real business. Anyone with a VCR, a computer and an MPEG encoder
card or external adapter, which can cost as little as $250, can
become a mogul in the counter-Hollywood of pirating.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a Web site called VCD-Import, based in Britain, sells
VCD copies of current films like ``The General's Daughter'' and
``Wild, Wild West'' for $5 apiece. The founder of VCD-Import, who
would identify himself only as Paul, wrote via e-mail that he gets
750 to 1,000 orders a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am well aware it is illegal in the U.K. to sell such
items,'' Paul wrote. ``But it is simply business and keeping up
with the demand for VCDs.'' He said British authorities have
pressured his payment provider to turn over customer information.
</P>
<P>
   Digital pirate versions of films first appeared on covert IRC
(Internet Relay Chat) channels and private FTP networks in early
1997. Typically, they were produced from copies of the original
film, either made with camcorders smuggled into theaters or the
more prized ``screener'' tapes intended for movie executives and
reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   Many are simply filmed by someone with a digital videocamera
smuggled into the theater. Video pirates then convert these
duplicates into MPEG-1 files of 500 to 600 megabytes apiece, which
are compressed and chopped into 15- to 20-megabyte morsels with
archiving software to ease the download.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, downloading a movie can still take from two hours to
two days depending on the file size and bandwidth constraints on
either end. The employee who viewed the new ``Austin Powers'' movie
first had to retrieve it: even with a T-1 line, the film, which
weighed in at 876 megabytes when reassembled, took seven hours to
download.
</P>
<P>
   There are 15 to 20 groups, with names like Eviliso and
VCD-Europe, that are regularly found on pirate Web sites. (Eviliso
digitally brands its copies with a letter Z that appears in the
corner of the screen.) The groups tend to distribute their goods
through ``couriers'' who often have little direct contact with
them.
</P>
<P>
   From their large FTP sites, these middlemen pass the data along
to friends and carefully screened acquaintances who move them
further down the trough. Like the pirates, the couriers do this
largely for bragging rights, not money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires a tremendous amount of time on line and lots of
dedication,'' a courier said by e-mail. He estimates that he spends
6 to 10 hours a day at it, ``but at the moment, I don't have
anything better to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few days, the files make their way to IRC, the chaotic
collection of chat channels where VCD aficionados loiter to see who
has a movie, game or other software they are willing to trade.
Pirated ``warez'' of all sorts are the currency of this virtual
economy, and there is lots of business for the person who has the
latest and best copy of the ``South Park'' movie or any other
downloadable flavor of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually some of these files make their way to Web sites,
although that makes the distribution easier to trace, so the links
don't generally last too long.
</P>
<P>
   What brought online pirate films to wider attention was a
digital bootleg of George Lucas' ``Phantom Menace'' that began
circulating soon after the film's theatrical release. A lawyer from
Lucasfilm sent cease-and-desist e-mail letters to several suspected
pirates. ``Society as a whole must accept and agree that online
piracy is not going to be allowed, and it will be punished,''
Radley said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the co-founder of ISO News, who goes by the online
name Krazy8, the e-mail from Lucasfilm scared away some pirates and
couriers. Those who still operate are keeping a lower profile:
access to their IRC channels and FTP servers is by invitation only
and requires passwords.
</P>
<P>
   But the publicity surrounding Lucasfilm's action also brought in
a horde of new people interested in downloading the film. ``Since
Lucasfilm made such a stink about it, I would bet there is at least
a 50 percent increase in the amount of people who are trying to and
may have downloaded a pirated version of `The Phantom Menace,'''
Krazy8 wrote in an e-mail interview. ``He brought huge light into
something only a few knew about.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most movie pirates are not making money from their
activities means little where copyright is concerned. Paul
Goldstein, a professor at Stanford University Law School who
specializes in copyright law, said that anyone guilty of copyright
infringement could face criminal charges as well as civil action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about it being a felony,'' Goldstein said,
adding that first offenses are punishable with up to five years in
jail and financial restitution. ``You can imagine how something
like `The Phantom Menace' being distributed over the Internet can
pose huges losses to the distributor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association of America's Internet piracy
division has asked Internet service providers to shut down a
handful of pirates and is working with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation to take further action against others.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Taylor, vice president of public affairs for the
association, conceded that pirates would eventually overcome any
technological safeguards built into movies to prevent pirating. But
by pursuing the traders, he said, the organization intends to
``change forever the perception that piracy is a low-risk and
high-reward proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those who would choose the illegal route would
hopefully think twice before doing so,'' Taylor continued,
``because of our attempts to find you and take every action at our
disposal to discourage you from continuing that activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The viewer of ``Austin Powers'' mused that Hollywood would be
better off capitalizing on the success of pirated MPEG versions.
After watching that film, he loaded an MPEG of the new independent
horror film ``The Blair Witch Project'' from his hard drive. ``I
can't wait to go see it in the theater,'' he said after watching a
few scenes. ``It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The pirated version of ``The Blair Witch Project'' has generated
a tremendous buzz in trading circles. The viewer wondered whether
the filmmakers themselves put a copy on line. ``Do you really think
this has never happened?'' he said. ``Small-budget independent
filmmakers couldn't buy the hype that `Blair Witch' has been
enjoying from word of mouth on the Internet. Is it out of the
question for a studio to `misplace' a reviewer copy and it
magically appears as the copy floats all around the VCD pirate
scene? Makes you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Curcio, chief executive of Artisan Entertainment, which
distributed ``The Blair Witch Project,'' said that while the
company marketed the film extensively on the Internet, it did not
intentionally leak a copy. He said that he suspected that the
pirated version was made from a screener copy that made its way
around Hollywood and that Artisan has sent out warnings to
suspected copyright infringers.
</P>
<P>
   But Curcio added that he could see the day, once encryption and
other protection is in place, when studios would use MPEGs to
transmit their products legally, much as the music industry has
taken to online music in answer to the challenge of MP3. Last
April, Artisan used streaming video to show its film ``Pi'' in a
pay-per-view window through Sightsound.com, a site that offers
streaming music and authorized movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an interesting experiment,'' he said. ``We didn't get a
lot of people buying it, but I think we learned a lot. The fact
that the technology is there to do it and the marketplace _ albeit
from an economic standpoint, still very, very small _ that, in the
future, it can certainly be a viable business.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor of the MPAA said that before Hollywood can effectively
use the Internet to distribute films, it must first educate its
audience. ``We want people to realize that just because it's on the
Internet, it's not all right for people to steal.''

TRACKING DOWN CELL-PHONE USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the big challenges for the cell phone industry in the
next two years will be the task of following its customers. The
Federal Communications Commission says that by early 2001, all cell
phone companies will have to provide 911 operators with the
location of anyone calling on a cell phone so help can get to the
right place.
</P>
<P>
   Several scientists at Lucent Technology's Bell Labs recently
announced that they had come up with a way to reduce the cost of
making this change. They said it would also let companies offer a
wide variety of new features, like a switch that would allow users
to protect their privacy by turning off the tracking.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of whether the systems for tracking cell phones
that are adopted will be an invasion of privacy is still an open
question. And it is not yet clear how the ability to locate any
phone in use quickly will be used.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there were essentially two strategies for
locating cell phone users. One depends on every cell phone tower
being able to estimate the distance of each phone from the tower.
Information from several towers can be used to pinpoint a phone in
use. For the other method, every handset needs to be able to
determine its own location, using the Global Positioning System.
The solution from Bell Labs is a hybrid of both systems.
</P>
<P>
   The tower-based approach to locating callers works by timing the
flow of signals between the towers and the handsets. That approach
would require a heavy investment by the cell phone company and is
accurate to only a few thousand feet. It is made more difficult by
the fact that a cell phone tries to minimize interference and
maximize battery life by lowering its broadcast strength until the
signal is just strong enough to reach one tower. But the method has
adherents because it would require no change in the handsets and
would work with older phones. A limited tower-based system is
already in use.
</P>
<P>
   The other basic method would require that each new handset be
programmed to find its own location using the Global Positioning
System. In essence, the phone manufacturers would blend the GPS
receivers popular with backpackers and surveyors into handsets. The
position information from such handsets would be more accurate,
estimating a location to within 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, the caller could use the GPS information
even when there was not an emergency. Backpackers, for example,
could use a cell phone to find their location and would not need to
carry a separate GPS receiver. That approach, however, would be
more expensive, and it could be slower because GPS receivers often
take several minutes to determine a location. GPS receivers also
require a separate antenna to perform well, and that could add bulk
to a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology is a hybrid of both approaches. It would use
an enhanced base station and a more sophisticated handset to solve
many of the problems found with the tower-based or GPS-based
options. While the system would rely on GPS signals to locate a
handset, it would also use information transmitted from local cell
towers. That information would let the handset calculate its
location with greater precision and speed than it would be able to
do with a GPS receiver alone.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Richton, a member of the Bell Labs technical staff
working on the project, explained that GPS signals were usually
difficult to decode, which was why it could take a handset with a
GPS receiver a minute or more to find its position.
</P>
<P>
   A GPS satellite sends two signals mixed together, Richton said,
one a high-frequency signal and the other a slower stream of data.
``One of the problems for a stand-alone handset is separating out
the two parts,'' Richton said. ``In our scheme, the network handles
that for you.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, the towers would constantly send to the handset
information that would give the handset a basis for interpreting
the satellite signal. The cell phone network, taking advantage of
the fact that its towers never move, would be able to keep track of
all the satellites continuously. That information would be
distilled into a basic summary of what the signals from the
satellites should look like. The handset would use that information
to locate the signal and calculate the slight timing differences
caused by changes in its location. That help would let the handset
come up with its location in a matter of seconds instead of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni Vannucci, another member of the Bell Labs staff, said
that the researchers had been able to find the location of outdoor
handsets with an accuracy of within 15 feet. The system is also
sophisticated enough to work with handsets indoors, even though
signals often bounce off metal objects, resulting in multiple
reflections. Most basic GPS systems cannot handle such
interference.
</P>
<P>
   The system would also be able to use the fixed locations of the
towers to strip away some of the error introduced intentionally by
the Global Positioning System's owner, the U.S. Department of
Defense. The military introduces a slowly changing error into the
signal in the hopes of confusing potential enemies and giving
United States forces an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Eisenberg, a spokesman for Lucent, said the company had
recently licensed the technology to Qualcomm, a major manufacturer
of cell phone base stations and handsets.
</P>
<P>
   The team from Lucent also said that phone companies were
brainstorming about how the location information could be used.
Many engineers want to use it to track failed phone calls and
reduce the dead spots that confound cell phone users.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing divisions, however, may come up with the most
creative uses. Some companies are considering charging land-line
rates when you use a cell phone within several thousand feet of
your home. That would give people more incentive to save money by
canceling their wired service. Of course, calls would be billed at
the regular mobile rate once the cell phone left the home area.
</P>
<P>
   Others are dreaming of using information about phone positions
to route calls. Dialing (800) PIZZAME, for instance, might direct
you to the closest pizza delivery shop. Pizza companies would
probably be charged for that listing.
</P>
<P>
   David Banisar, an editor of ``The Electronic Privacy Papers''
(Wiley, 1997), said he worried that the phone companies would
become so entranced with selling the tracking data to marketers
that they would not give users control over the feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day as you go home, you drive the same route,'' he said.
``The marketers would love to be able to sell the fact that you
drive by the same store each day to that store. A cell phone
shouldn't be a tracking device.''

TURNING YOUR OLD SLIDES INTO DIGITAL IMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have hundreds of old 35-mm slides in carousels. Is there a
way to convert them on my computer myself so i can have electronic
copies or send them to friends in e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have plenty of time and want to invest in a scanner
for your computer, you can convert your slides to a digital format
like JPEG. Then they can easily be archived or sent as e-mail
attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Scanners, which translate photos into digital images, come in
many different models and vary greatly in quality. Prices range
from under $100 to several thousand dollars. If you're scanning
slides, you'll need to get a model that can handle transparencies.
Some scanners are made especially for slides. Most come with basic
image editing software and instructions to get you started.
</P>
<P>
   Once you begin to scan your pictures, you may run into a problem
of storage room. Image files generally take up more space than text
files, and you may find your hard drive filling up fast.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to get an external hard drive or a Zip drive to
store the files, or you could invest in a CD-ROM recorder, which
will let you copy the images. Once you have a CD recorder, you can
also make copies of some or all of your collection to give to
friends.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide that you don't want to convert the slides
yourself, it's usually possible to find a graphics service to do
the work for you.

game to use fully all 12 buttons and both thumb-size joysticks on
Sony's Playstation controller.
</P>
<P>
   The premise: Doddering professor invents two highly dangerous
devices _ a time machine and a bowl-shape metal helmet for
enhancing monkey intelligence (you can tell that this device is
incredibly advanced because it has a police light on top).
</P>
<P>
   Before either device is tested, a sly little simian escapes from
the local amusement park, steals the helmet, turns into a mad
monkey genius and fits hundreds of his monkey friends with these
brain-boosting colanders. They hijack the time machine, determined
to change history so monkeys will rule the world. (Sony has
dispensed with the zoological distinction between monkeys and apes
for the sake of a great title.)
</P>
<P>
   Your mission: go back in time and, with both thumbs and index
fingers, use a series of gadgets to recapture the monkeys and make
history safe for homo sapiens.
</P>
<P>
   The manual dexterity required is nontrivial. In general, you
control movement with your thumb on the left joystick, camera
angles with the left buttons, jumping and gadget selection with the
right buttons and gadget use with your other thumb on the right
joystick.
</P>
<P>
   To bag a monkey, you use the left joystick to chase it down
while swinging a stun club with the right joystick. Once the
creature is immobilized, you quickly switch from the stun club to a
handheld monkey net, using the right buttons, and maneuver the net,
using the right joystick, to nab the monkey before it snaps out of
its split-second torpor.
</P>
<P>
   But preteens with Playstations are not the only primate
population grappling with new joystick techniques. At the Sonny
Carter Life Science Laboratory at Georgia State University, monkeys
and apes are also getting a chance to play video games. For more
than a decade, researchers at Georgia State have been conducting
NASA-financed research on the ability of rhesus monkeys and
chimpanzees to use off-the-shelf joysticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the literature, and contrary to a number of
reasons why they shouldn't have learned, they did learn, and they
learned really quickly,'' said Dr. David Washburn, who has
published studies using a group of 10 rhesus monkeys who spend
their days selecting from a menu of simple computer games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done the concentration game, the memory game where you
turn over a bunch of cards, except in this case the cards are
computer generated,'' Washburn said. ``They've done two-dimensional
maze things that look a lot like Pac-Man.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, our primate cousins love video games. Left to
their own devices, they are happy to kill time chasing dots of
light across a screen, even when they're not rewarded with food.
``We have a chimpanzee who's been known to call up the task of
running mazes from the menu and worked on them 20, 30 minutes just
for the sheer joy of working on novel mazes,'' said Dr. Duane
Rumbaugh, a professor of psychology who supervises the joystick
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will they play, but they can be trained to get better.
``We have training programs that are very simple that teach them
what happens when they move the joystick, and they have to do more
demanding things all the time,'' Rumbaugh said. At each milestone,
they're rewarded, often with an interesting visual display or a
sound that lets them know they've done a good job. ``So in a
stepwise manner,'' Rumbaugh said, ``they finally get very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is interesting because video games for people work the
same way. The first level of Ape Escape, for instance, is very
easy. None of the monkeys challenge or attack you, or shoot or
throw things, as they do later in the game. All you have to do is
get used to roaming around and learn how to use the stun club and
the net. After a few minutes, you've bagged all the monkeys, and
there is a flash of light around your character, Spike, as he jumps
up and yells, ``Yes!'' (along with an interesting visual display
and a sound to let you know you've done a good job).
</P>
<P>
   From there, you move on to a training room where you can master
your next gadget before moving on to the next level. Thus, in a
stepwise manner, even minimally literate youngsters can get very
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised at how quickly the 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds
were picking up the game,'' said Ami Blair, 31, a brand manager at
Sony who conducted extensive focus tests with kids who played Ape
Escape in groups of 10 (10 seems to be the magic number for monkeys
and grade-schoolers alike). After they had played the game for
eight hours straight, she said, ``they were having a much easier
time than I was, and I knew exactly what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Georgia State primate lab, Washburn has also been
outpaced by his test group. ``CNN picked up on the monkey work
about five years ago,'' he said. ``We had published a paper showing
that if you give them a task where the monkeys have to shoot at a
moving target, and then you put both monkeys on the same screen so
that they're competing, they change their behavior, reflecting the
fact that they're competing. And so in a CNN interview, in front of
the world, I had the dubious pleasure of saying, `And when I
compete against the monkeys, I lose.'''
</P>
<P>
   But then, Washburn is also over 30. One wonders how the Georgia
State monkeys would fare against the Ape Escape focus group.
Monkeys against first graders: may the best primate win. ``We've
actually had to do that,'' Washburn said. ``With things that
require quick reaction, we've had to use kids to compete with the
monkeys. Six-year-olds, plus or minus two years. The monkeys still
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait until the monkeys get T-1 lines. On-line gamers, watch out.

TOWARD BETTER COMMUNICATION ACROSS THE LANGUAGE BARRIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of the jet set, take note: Scientists have created
speech-synthesizer technology that translates spoken words from one
language into another, even when the speaker and listener are on
opposite sides of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The technology was tested last week during an all-day video
conference that spanned six countries. In the United States, a
technologist at Carnegie Mellon University planned a hypothetical
trip to Japan by talking to technologists there without speaking a
word of Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese experienced the whole conversation in their native
tongue. Representatives from laboratories in Germany, Italy, France
and Korea also participated.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists did not simply hear themselves talk. They
also tested, in separate demonstrations, what they call ``face
translation,'' where the faces of the speakers were morphed by
applying computer animation to the speakers' eyes and lips on a
static photograph of their faces. People at Carnegie Mellon, for
example, saw the lips of their Japanese counterparts move as if
they were speaking English, not Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked beautifully,'' said Dr. Alex Waibel, acting chairman
of the Consortium for Speech Translation Advanced Research, or
C-STAR (www.c-star.org). ``Some of it still looks a little goofy,
but that is a detail we can smooth out.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations were the culmination of nearly a decade of
work by C-STAR, which showed in 1991 that computers could translate
already specified sets of words. Since then, the group has worked
toward designing a system that can process casual speech. It has
created an intermediary computer language called interlingua that
can recognize words spoken in one of six languages, filter out
interruptions and turn them into short commands.
</P>
<P>
   At the demonstration, for example, the statement, ``OK, I'd like
to book a tour in Kyoto, please,'' was invisibly translated into
terse computer code, which was then translated into a Japanese
sentence that was spoken by a computerized speech synthesizer and
heard in Japan after a lag of several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If the face-translation technology had also been included with
that test, scientists said, the synthesized voice would have been
synchronized with the animated movement of the English speakers'
lips.
</P>
<P>
   The speech-synthesis technology is already being used in a
wearable gadget for tourists that C-STAR hopes will become a
commercial product: a hand-held computer that provides geographical
directions and translates words from, say, a box-office operator in
Germany into something that can be read or heard by the person
wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that C-STAR's technology can substitute for actually
learning another language, Waibel said. But, he added, ``it's good
to have some training wheels.''

A PLACE FOR JOHN CARTERS AROUND THE WORLD TO FIND ONE ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago in Australia, back when the World Wide Web had
only a few strands, a computer consultant and grandfather in
Melbourne named John Carter received a message on Fidonet, a public
bulletin board, intended for a John Carter who lived in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet grew, the Australian John Carter searched for
the South African John Carter and found a lot of other John Carters
in the process, via search engines like whowhere.com and Internet
Address Finder.
</P>
<P>
   So the John Carter home page, NetSmart John Carters,
(members.tripod.com/jcarter/jcwww.html) was born. Carter sent
e-mail messages to all the other John Carters he could find and
posted links to their home pages, when available, on his site.
</P>
<P>
   He also presented some of the replies he received, which begin
with salutations like ``Hi John, What a great name you have!'' and
``By gorrah, annudder one!''
</P>
<P>
   There's a story from John Robert Carter, an Australian living in
England, who visited a cafe there with the name ``John R. Carter''
printed in large letters out front. After a little discussion with
the owner, he wrote, ``it turned out that we were BOTH called John
ROBERT Carter, and that his birthday was the same date as mine, and
he was exactly 30 years older than me! Strangely, we didn't really
get on. He overcharged me for my cup of tea. So what's in a name?''
</P>
<P>
   And John Carter of St. Petersburg, Fla., wrote: ``In fact, at my
job (semitechnical position at a mutual fund company), one of the
corporate lawyers' name is John Carter. His secretary's name is
Debbie Carter (no relation), and Debbie's husband's and son's names
are both John Carter!'' He tips his hat to Dr. John Carter, a
character on the television show ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   The site is also peppered with mentions of ``John Carter of
Mars,'' the title of one Edgar Rice Burroughs novel and a character
in several others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be veritable plagues of me,'' wrote John
Carter, the South African. ``I know of John Carter the bishop, and
a John M. Carter the physicist. (John Carter the physicist once
caused my mother much alarm and despondency. The physicist and I
both worked at the Nuclear Physics Research Unit at the University
of the Witwatersrand at one time many years ago. One dark and
stormy night I was working late when my mother phoned asking for
me. She was vehemently told that I had gone off to New Zealand and
wouldn't be back for quite awhile.)''
</P>
<P>
   Via e-mail, the original Carter said he was not aware of any
other home pages for people with common names. A brief search for
sites for the James Smiths, Mary Joneses, Bob Johnsons and Jose
Rodriguezes of the world did not yield any similar pages. Their
loss. But people with common names have formed clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very gratifying at the time to receive responses from
namesakes from all walks of life around the world,'' Carter the
Webmaster wrote in an e-mail message. ``It made me realize just how
much the internet has shrunk the world.''

LOBBY NEED POLISH? VOILA! A CONCIERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Its front-line employees having completed a
three-month training program to improve service for travelers,
Amtrak announced in advertisements this month: ``10,000 employees
went back to school. 10,000 concierges graduated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that the breakfast roll became a croissant, even
with a fried egg and Canadian bacon on it, the concierge has become
a concept that knows few bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked the word because `concierge' means someone you can
approach who will make it happen,'' said Barbara Richardson,
Amtrak's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Though it bases its popularity on the reputations of desk clerks
at four-star hotels, for whom no service request is unrealizable,
today's concierge industry is untethered to performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the attitude of a concierge, that's a large part
of it,'' said Holly Stiel, a former concierge who started Holly
Speaks, a consulting business in Mill Valley, Calif., whose clients
include Bank of America and Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   On Amtrak's No. 171 from New York to Washington on Saturday, the
newly trained ex-conductors and attendants had much in common with
the traditional concierge: the French war widow with the keys who
runs the hotel by her own rules. One conductor was helping two
extensively tattooed men not with tickets to ``Wit'' but with
return times to New York. In the cafe car, the attendant was
bullying a small boy into choosing a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next stop Newark!'' said Mike Sternfeld, the conductor on the
intercom, who introduced himself I'm-your-server style, listing the
stations like chef's specials. But the next stop was unannounced:
10 minutes in the bleached green marshes of New Jersey, as
unexplained as a delay between courses.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is hopping a business trend for personal services.
Hospitals and kennels now boast concierges. ``I even received a
call from a prison that was interested in having me come and speak
to them,'' said Michael Romei, chief concierge at the Waldorf
Towers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, concierges are finding themselves back where they
started: on residential building staffs. Though they are not castle
candle-keepers, or ``comtes des cierges,'' as they were in the
middle ages, the one-year-old National Concierge Association
estimates that one-quarter of its 150 members are now residential
concierges.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the phenomenon is not new, but it is newly popular,
with a prosperous real estate market and a demand for the latest
level of, and last word in, building services. A concierge has a je
ne sais quoi, like a fragrance brand, that a doorman doesn't _ more
personal assistant than package-toter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A terrific number of buildings have inaugurated concierge
services in the last five years,'' said Stuart Saft, chairman of
the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. ``Certainly
new buildings have built front desks and designated clerks as
concierges. Interestingly, older buildings are doing it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Henenson, director of on-site sales and marketing at Douglas
Elliman, the commercial and residential real estate firm, agreed.
``The word has a certain cachet,'' he said. ``It's marketing as
much as anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the ambiance of having a concierge is specific, the
services are not.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Byrne, a concierge at the Exchange, at 25 Broad St., a
two-year-old converted office building, won't pick up or return
videotapes, but he will recommend them.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Waking Ned Devine,' '' Byrne said. ``A very nice Irish
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a concierge is asked to coordinate pickups and
deliveries, call car services, log guests in and out and expedite
requests, like making arrangements for repairs. Infrequently,
George Almegor, a concierge at a 1-year-old apartment building at
150 E. 57th St., has reserved a restaurant table or tickets for a
show. He has also fed fish. He has paid bills. He has played Cupid
for single tenants.
</P>
<P>
   When two women asked for male strippers, he gave them the yellow
pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have been my grandmothers,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a previous job, he broke up a fight in the lobby. After
knocking on a door one night, he discovered a dead body. ``A guy
with a football helmet. Rubbed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Almegor admitted to stress on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to please everyone when you're pulled in 10 directions at
once,'' he said. ``People can be nasty, make a mountain out of a
molehill. Dry cleaning _ a missing suit at 8 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   If not the patience of a saint, Almegor has technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a step back, count to three, to recover my professional
poise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As people find themselves squeezed for time between work and
play, equally stressful schedule-flexing spheres in New York, the
perception of what a residential concierge can or can't do has
begun to shimmer like a mirage. For tenants thirsty for services,
the small desk in the lobby, palmy with pleasant, friendly faces,
is the nearest oasis in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   But few concierges end up working like camels. Most draw a line
in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   The city's newest luxury buildings are promising a caravan of
services through the concierge. At the Textile Building, at 66
Leonard St., which is now selling condominiums at $795,000 to $6.5
million, these include housekeepers, personal trainers, masseuses,
acupuncturists and caterers, said Annabelle Schachner, the sales
director. But even $6.5 million later, the concierge will talk the
talk, not walk the walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you where the line is,'' Ms. Schachner said of the
limits of the job. ``They can't leave the desk.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the desk is the front line in the new theater of war on
what the concierge is there to do. Because the concierge is not a
doorman or an elevator man, he or she is perceived as a free agent,
available to run errands, walk dogs, park cars and supervise
repairs, deliveries and other services upstairs in tenants'
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Szabo, at the Alfred, a condominium building on West 61st
Street, has been asked to do all of the above. Time permitting, he
complies, or ``you bow out gracefully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You say, `I'm not available,' '' he said. ``They ask for
someone else on the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Szabo, a young man with stiffly gelled blond hair and a goatee,
was a doorman in the building for four years before becoming a
concierge four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all job titles,'' he said, sitting in a square enclosure
in the lobby. ``Basically it's the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Szabo will walk dogs on his break. Tenants' increasing time
pressures also make them forget. ``They forget to make arrangements
for a delivery, or they forget to tell you there's someone on their
way. You have to contact them at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many concierges in the city, Szabo recites the golden rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do it once, it becomes your job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriella Szathmary, a concierge at the new Trump Place
condominium at 200 Riverside Blvd., recited her version.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do today as a favor, tomorrow they're going to
expect,'' she said, standing behind a marble desk that extends like
a ship's bow into the entrance lobby. Ms. Szathmary was previously
a private secretary for a woman living on Park Avenue. She will
walk dogs in an emergency. ``You would do it for your neighbor _
they know I'm not a dog-walker,'' she said. But doing errands is
not in the cards. ``Obviously, grocery shopping is not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Caudwell, a professor of English at Fordham University and
the author of ``A Short History of Rudeness'' (Picador USA, 1999),
explained that the rise in popularity of the concierge as a new
type of service staff member might be a convenient diffusion of a
difficult social situation: newly affluent tenants in an expanding
economy who are able to employ servants but uncertain about how to
engage them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rely on iconographic signs,'' he said. ``If someone's
behind a desk, or if the uniform looks more like a business suit,
it legitimizes more in the way of demands. You think: `A concierge
is a competent profession. I can stop at the desk and make any
demand I want to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fabian Smith, a concierge at River Tower on West 63rd Street,
says no as the Japanese do: by saying yes-but.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I would love to do it, but I can't do it _ it's against
management rules,' '' he said, repeating his response to requests
he can't grant. `` `It's in our union contract.' I go into details.
If you say no bluntly, they think you're being rude.'' Smith
directs his large lobby briskly, like a traffic policeman,
dispatching service people, recommending a cleaning woman,
answering his telephones. He makes wake-up calls. He helps tenants
who can't cook with advice about oven temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   A young man in a business suit approached the desk and asked
Smith if he would supervise a furniture delivery, waiting in the
apartment until the furniture was installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to,'' Smith explained, ``but I can't. It's
management policy.'' The tenant observed that the failure to gain
Smith's cooperation ``kind of defeats the purpose of a concierge
building.'' Smith smiled commiseratively, suggesting a call to
management.

<P>
   Two years ago, as Charles Finnie, an investment banker in San
Francisco, was driving home from work, he did what he did nearly
every time he got in the car: he picked up his cell phone and
started dialing. Eyes averted from the road, he slammed into the
car in front of him. No one was injured, but the impact jammed
Finnie's door shut. So he climbed out through the sun roof _ still
talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone is maligned far and wide as an instrument not
just of rudeness but also of physical harm. People hear about it
emitting cancer-causing microwaves, disrupting pacemakers and
causing navigational confusion in airplanes. Just last week, an
airline passenger in Britain was sentenced to a year in prison for
endangering a flight by refusing to switch off his mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate with the most momentum these days is the one
surrounding cell phones as potential driving hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Phoning while driving has been banned in several countries,
including Israel, Spain, Brazil and parts of Australia. After a
Japanese study found that the number of traffic accidents related
to car phones increased by 11 percent in Japan from 1997 to 1998,
driving with a cell phone in hand was banned there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Recent fatal car accidents around the nation have been
attributed to drivers who were distracted because they were using
their mobile phones. Last March, Brooklyn, Ohio, a Cleveland
suburb, made it illegal to use a cell phone handset while driving,
and the phones are now off-limits to New York cabdrivers.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is understandable. Anyone who has reached for a
ringing cell phone or dialed while at the steering wheel knows the
phones are distracting. The question is whether they pose such a
danger that they should be banished from drivers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, a trade group in Washington, there are nearly 77
million cell phones in use in the United States, and a new customer
signs up every 1.25 seconds. A 1997 survey by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration found that nearly 9 out of 10 cell
telephone owners used them at least occasionally while driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very rapidly moving field,'' said Mark Burris, a
research associate at the Center for Urban Transportation Research
at the University of South Florida in Tampa, which recently
released a report on cell phone use by drivers. ``The rapid
decrease in cost of a cell phone means a lot more people have
access to them, and a lot of people are driving. Put the two
together and this could be a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones in the car are, of course, a distraction like many
others. Reaching for a cell phone is no different, really, than
stretching for a cassette, unwrapping a cheeseburger or turning
around to scold a child. But the public image of many cell phone
users _ as pushy, self-important multitaskers _ highlights the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have examined the potential hazards of talking
on a cell phone while driving. The one most widely cited was
conducted by researchers at the University of Toronto and published
in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While pointing out that cellular telephones could be used in
emergencies to summon help (eventually they will all be able to
report their locations as well), enhancing drivers' safety, the
study concluded that talking on a cell phone while driving was as
dangerous as driving while at the threshold of legal intoxication.
That is, the risk of a collision when using a cell phone was found
to be four times as high as the risk when a cell phone was not
being used.
</P>
<P>
   An author of the study, Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a professor of
medicine at the University of Toronto, said it was the distraction
of the conversation itself, not the act of dialing or holding the
phone, that accounted for most of the increased risk. For that
reason, hands-free phones do not solve the problem and may even
worsen it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a hands-free phone, Redelmeier said, ``might lull drivers
into a false sense of security and encourage them to make calls
they might otherwise have avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Corroborating Redelmeier's conclusion, other studies point out
that most accidents occur while drivers are in the middle of
conversations, not while they are dialing or answering calls.
</P>
<P>
   The increased risk persisted ``even among those drivers who'd
owned a cell phone over many years,'' Redelmeier said. ``It's not
inexperience, but perhaps a more fundamental limitation of driving
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others who have taken a hard look at cell phones in cars,
Redelmeier was inspired by a personal experience. ``I was in my
office at the end of the day returning phone calls and caught up
with a patient on his cell phone,'' he recalled. ``We were talking
and then he said, `I've got to stop talking _ I've just been in an
accident.'''
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, Redelmeier said, but the incident started
him thinking about the role he may have played in the accident.
``It certainly made me think about whether having a conversation
with his personal physician distracted him and caused the
accident,'' he said. ``It brought new sting to the cliche of
`physician, do no harm.'''
</P>
<P>
   Findings like Redelmeier's have received widespread attention
but have had little effect on legislation so far.
</P>
<P>
   In several states, bills have been introduced, then have
fizzled. Mike Pugh, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol,
said the cellular communications industry was too strong in his
state for such legislation to win approval. And legislators are
also enamored of the technology, Pugh pointed out. ``They'll be in
the same room, on their phones, talking to each other from across
the room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York state has legislation pending to address the problem.
Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, a Democrat from Brooklyn, is the sponsor
of several bills related to cell phones being considered in Albany.
He said he had introduced his legislation after witnessing an
accident involving a cell phone. ``It is completely seriously
dangerous to drive and talk at the same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, the industry's main lobbying arm, see no reason to
single out cell phones as a safety hazard. ``Everything in the car
is a distraction,'' said the association's president, Tom Wheeler.
Wheeler said it was more important to educate drivers on using cell
phones safely, just as they learn other aspects of safe driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make a judgment that no, you're not going to push
down on that accelerator and make it through the yellow light, or
decide this is not the right time to have some sort of heated
conversation on a cell phone or dial the phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Association officials pointed out that the Toronto study had
been criticized because even though it used cell phone records to
correlate accident times with calls, it was unclear whether the
calls had been made immediately before or after the accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on the use of cell phones by drivers say studies will be
more reliable if accident reports are changed to include a specific
place for a police officer to indicate whether a mobile phone was a
factor in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our recommendation is that all the states change their
accident reporting forms to include whether a cell phone may have
been in use or even the cause of the accident,'' said Burris, of
the University of South Florida. ``That way we'd have nationwide
data to use in the coming years so that legislation can be based on
sound accident analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Because more detailed information is needed, a spokesman for the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said, the agency is
preparing to conduct its own research on cell phones and other
distractions for drivers. ``I'm not sure we could ever legislate
attentiveness to driving,'' said the agency's administrator, Dr.
Ricardo Martinez. ``But when you put things into vehicles, you
should focus on how you design it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he was concerned about what he called the emerging
e-car. ``Cars are becoming mobile computers, with GPS and weather
information and voice-activated e-mail,'' he said, making a
reference to the Global Positioning Satellite system. ``All these
things are more and more going to affect a driver's mental
distraction. We need to make sure that these devices actually
enhance the driving experience and don't drive us to distraction.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His graying hair reaches the ears, but it is
considerably shorter than the near shoulder-length style Keith
Stroup wore in the 1970s when he was known as Mr. Marijuana, the
prime minister of pot.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the nation's foremost marijuana legalization
lobby has also trimmed back the reckless behavior and
anti-establishment antics that turned him into a counterculture
hero on college campuses and persona non grata in some quarters of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be misled: The 55-year-old executive director of the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws has not
completely changed his ways. Stroup still gets stoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what the government would lead you to believe, a
lot of us did not give up our marijuana smoking,'' said Stroup.
``We may not be as open about it. We may have to work and support a
family. That doesn't mean when Friday night comes along that we
don't still smoke marijuana instead of drink alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years ago, Stroup and a few similarly rebellious
friends created NORML in a burst of indignation over the jailing of
thousands of young marijuana smokers. Now he is back at the helm of
the group after being forced out in 1979 for violating the drug
movement's code against informing on another's drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a sensation at the time, Stroup _ angry over the Carter
administration's policy in support of spraying the herbicide
paraquat on Mexican marijuana fields _ confirmed for a reporter
that the president's drug adviser snorted cocaine at a wild NORML
party in 1977. The revelation in the summer of 1978 contributed to
the aide's ouster but ignited a push for Stroup's removal as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing years, Stroup (rhymes with top) practiced law,
directed the trade association for criminal defense lawyers, joined
other public interest efforts and worked on behalf of family
farmers. But in the mid-1990s, he was invited back to the board of
NORML to restore some vigor to the group. He formally returned as
full-time director two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stroup concedes his side was battered in the drug war during his
exile; marijuana was closer to being legalized in NORML's 1970s
heyday than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 20 years all you heard was `just say no,'
mandatory penalties, zero tolerance and how many people can we lock
up in this country,'' said Stroup.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other key members of the legalization movement
believe the pendulum may be swinging their way. They point to the
approval of medical marijuana initiatives in a handful of states
and a decision last year by voters in Oregon _ the first state to
drop criminal penalties for marijuana possession in 1973 _ to
reject a legislative push to recriminalize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is beginning to turn,'' said Dr. Lester Grinspoon,
chairman of the NORML Foundation and a Harvard Medical School
professor whose 1971 work ``Marijuana Reconsidered'' was one of the
first scholarly papers to claim the drug was essentially harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Even Congress is giving the issue a look. A House subcommittee
is conducting hearings on the concept of legalization, not that
anyone anticipates the fervidly anti-drug, GOP-controlled chamber
to move forward on that front anytime soon. Conservative lawmakers
are more apt to advocate jailing people like Stroup for pressing
legalization.
</P>
<P>
   To anti-drug leaders, legalization proponents like Stroup are
dangerous and misguided elitists concerned more with their own
gratification than the larger consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are mostly affluent, well-educated and socially distant
from the potential victims of their experiment,'' said a disdainful
Thomas A. Constantine, former administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Agency, during one of the recent legalization hearings of the House
Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still fighting this old battle that marijuana is a
perfectly safe, harmless drug,'' said Dr. Herbert Kleber, medical
director at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at
Columbia University. ``To that extent, they are not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroup was one of the first combatants in that fight. Born in a
small rural community in southern Illinois, Stroup came to
Washington in 1968 for law school. The ambitious young man quickly
grew enamored of the high-powered atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   After a friend was busted, Stroup, then working as a government
lawyer to avoid the draft, became intrigued with the enforcement of
marijuana laws. He originated the concept of NORML, which he got
off the ground in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Stroup toured college campuses, showing the campy movie ``Reefer
Madness.'' NORML conferences became a fixture in Washington.
Prominent people like former Attorney General Ramsey Clark joined
the group's board. The fast-talking, fact-tossing Stroup was a
master at manipulating the sympathetic press and he became a
leading voice for the pot-smoking generation of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He also lived the life himself, was arrested for possession in
Canada and had numerous scrapes with the law, a colorful history
chronicled in a 1981 book, ``High in America'' by Patrick Anderson.
Stroup did drugs, rubbed shoulders with rock stars and other
counterculture celebrities and generally roared down the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   But he came to a screeching halt in 1978. In the midst of a
bitter fight over the herbicide spraying, Stroup contributed to the
downfall of Peter Bourne, President Carter's drug adviser. Angry
over Bourne's paraquat stance, Stroup helped make the cocaine
incident public, a disclosure that helped fuel a perception of the
Carter administration as soft on drug abuse and rife with drug
users.
</P>
<P>
   Stroup regrets his role but said he was driven by anger over the
potential herbicide poisoning of unsuspecting marijuana smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Stroup said a new government idea _ deploying
marijuana-destroying fungus against pot plants in Florida _ reminds
him of the paraquat program. But he predicts that fears about the
environmental consequences should the fungus attack other crops
will doom the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Stroup admitted he might seem ``out of sync slightly'' as a
middle-aged champion of marijuana use, someone known around his own
office as a ``cool old guy.'' But while his delivery is more
tempered than in the past, his message is the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a significant segment of the American public who are
regular smokers,'' said Stroup. ``Our challenge is to translate
what is clearly public support into public policy.''

<P>
   On the original model of the Sony Walkman, introduced in the
United States 20 years ago this month, there was an orange button.
The TPS-L2, a blue-black plastic model released in this country
under the name Soundabout, played cassette tapes, but it also had a
second earphone jack and an extra set of earphones. When you pushed
the orange button, the sound emerged from two sets of phones.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revealing feature: Sony was apparently worried about
the solitary nature of the device. The orange button was like a
panic button, an emergency ``share'' feature. The company was
hesitant to release a product that could be considered selfish,
Akio Morita, a Sony co-founder, wrote later.
</P>
<P>
   The orange button was soon removed and the name Soundabout was
replaced with Walkman, the name under which the device had been
released in Japan six months earlier. Sony's invention quickly
became an enormous success, largely because of its solitary nature.
Competitors introduced rival products into the new category of
``personal portable audio,'' but the trademark name Walkman became
synonymous in everyday speech with personal portable tape player.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the 20th anniversary, the Walkman is close to a staple;
more than 185 million have been sold. A Walkman very much like the
model that cost $200 20 years ago can be found for $20,
blister-wrapped on the shelves of discount stores or even drugstore
chains. The basic shape of the first model has evolved into many
models and styles of Walkmans (Sony's preferred plural): personal
sound demanded personal style.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Bayley, a design historian, calls the Walkman one of the
most significant products of its time. For many years, it
symbolized the success of Japan's economy, as well as the skill of
its engineers in miniaturization and of its marketers in sales and
packaging. It even evoked the Japanese tradition of design: the
blue-black case resembled a traditional Japanese lacquered box.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Walkman changed people's relationship to
technology; its solitary, enveloping quality became its defining
feature. The Walkman and its rivals quickly became a landmark in
the history of media and a symbol of an inwardly focused era.
``Personal sound'' was a forerunner of personal computers and
personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Michael Schiffer, author of ``The Portable Radio in
American Life'' (University of Arizona Press, 1991), notes that the
idea of private portable music was initiated in the mid-1950s by
the transistor radio with its single earpiece. The difference the
Walkman brought, Schiffer said in an interview, was to free the
listener from dependence on the fixed programs of radio. The tape
cassette (first introduced in 1965) allowed people to choose their
music. People made tapes of their favorite music, but they also
purchased recorded tapes. By 1983 the Walkman had helped push sales
of cassette tapes past those for vinyl records.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Nell, Sony's vice president in charge of audio products,
said that the Walkman ``provided listeners with a personal
soundtrack to their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Holt, of the design firm Frogdesign, which provided Sony
with alternative designs in the early days of the Walkman, said
that the Walkman ``brought a kind of spectacle to daily life and
made humdrum activities feel cinematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, the sociologist Edward Hall introduced the
concept of the space bubble, a culturally conditioned distance that
dictates how close people stand to others and how much space
someone needs to feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The Walkman might be said to have introduced another kind of
bubble: a technological bubble of concentration and obliviousness
to surroundings, a private space in public. Today, the streets are
full of cellular telephone users enveloped in similar bubbles of
communication and concentration. Palm organizers and other small
digital devices have similar effects.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological effects showed up first with the Walkman: note
how the mobile Walkman user boldly makes eye contact with other
pedestrians, as if somehow unconsciously reasoning that because
onlookers cannot hear what he is listening to, they also cannot see
what he is looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Having arrived at the beginning of the '80s, the Walkman seems
to have signaled the beginning of a time of introspection, even
narcissism. Holt recalls hearing and reading the sentiment in the
early 1980s that the Walkman fostered dangerous isolation and
immersion. That immersion led to traffic laws forbidding drivers to
wear the devices, lest they fail to hear a crucial horn or siren.
</P>
<P>
   There are many different accounts of the creation of the
Walkman. One widely disseminated tale had Akio Morita playing
tennis and wishing that he could have his music with him on the
court. That corporate myth is in keeping with the Japanese business
tradition of crediting a company's leader with all important
innovations. Another apocryphal tale had Morita visiting a factory
and talking to a worker who asked for tunes on the assembly line.
(Here the chief executive figures as benevolent boss.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the most convincing account, pieced together from Sony's own
documents and Morita's autobiography, ``Made in Japan,'' ascribes
the Walkman idea to Masaru Ibuka, with whom Morita had founded the
company. Ibuka was the more technical of the pair and often visited
the development laboratories. He expressed frustration at not being
able to carry his favorite music with him on airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   To please him, in November 1978 a Sony engineer named Shizuo
Takashino began with the Pressman, a Sony tape recorder popular
among reporters. He removed the recording apparatus and speaker and
added a stereo amplifier. The only real technical breakthrough was
the development of light headphones, with their little sponge
earpieces. These were found in a laboratory next door.
</P>
<P>
   The revealing part of Morita's tale regards the reaction when he
took the prototype Walkman home. ``I noticed my experiment was
annoying my wife, who felt shut out,'' he reported in his book, so
he ordered the addition of a second headset jack and the orange
button. Morita ``thought it would be considered rude for one person
to be listening to his music in isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's sales staff had another worry _ that no one would buy a
tape player that could only play, not record. Morita insisted that
it be a player only. Car stereo players didn't record and no one
minded, he pointed out. Without any market testing, the product was
ordered into production within four months.
</P>
<P>
   The virtuosity of the first Walkman was that it daringly exposed
precise technology to the perils of portability. In the years
since, personal music technology has improved a great deal. The
first Walkman could run for 8 hours on a single charge of its
batteries; today's models can run for 60. But for listening to
sound on the go, tape was succeeded by the portable CD. From the
Walkman sprang the Discman and the Watchman and their competitors.
Sony's Minidisc, a format that has still not caught on, continues
the tradition, as do portable MP3 devices like the Diamond Rio and
Creative's Nomad: different media, same message.
</P>
<P>
   Sony continues to tinker with the device it made famous. There
is a Walkman room in a Sony building in the Shinagawa section of
Tokyo that housed the advanced engineering team for the company. It
is the only place in the world where an example of each of the
200-some Walkman models is preserved. The best known are displayed
in a glass box of 30 cubicles; shelves contain dozens more. There
are hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of variants in color and
material. No one in the company seems to know quite how many.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gioscia, director of Sony's design center in Park Ridge,
N.J., said the phrase ``lifestyle enhancement'' was now used to
match the design of individual Walkman models to activities like
running or camping _ the Walkman had quickly become associated with
athletic activity. People ran or did aerobics with their machines
in hand. But when the designers really looked at runners using the
devices, Gioscia said, they found that instead of clipping them to
their waistbands or belts, they tended to carry them. So his
designers developed ``grip'' models.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in fashion have brought white, then black, then silver
Walkmans. The Sports line took its yellow from the bright color of
scuba divers' air tanks. A line called Outback came in sand-colored
plastic and had a ribbed body, signaling ruggedness like a Jeep
Sahara vehicle. In the United States, Sony has offered models
called Freq and Psyc. Aimed at teen-agers, the Psyc line clips to a
belt or backpack. Some Psyc models are molded of the same
translucent blues and greens as the iMac computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am as different as they are,'' the slogan for the Psyc line,
would serve as a worthy motto for the whole history of the Walkman.
A product that began as a basic box, a universal sound appliance,
has taken on as many different shapes and styles as the music
played on it.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly models have been developed for varying markets
around the world. In Europe, there is Yppy, a ribbed metallic line,
as rigid as the techno music popular there. In Japan there are
glow-in-the-dark Walkmans and models inspired by the Hello Kitty
line of characters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sony released a kidney-shape plastic model called
Beans. It was the first Walkman to be designed by a woman, Rie
Isono. Its shape suggested a device as vital to daily life as an
internal organ.

WICHITA FALLS, Texas: town movie houses. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   4. GET OUT OF TOWN: Lovers of history and small towns will want
to roam 20 miles south to Archer City, home of author Larry
McMurtry and his fascinating Booked Up store, the Spur Hotel and
the Texasville Chalk Hill Grill.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can head north across the Red River into the Comanche,
Choctaw and Chickasaw nations. Oklahoma attractions within about an
hour's drive of the Falls include Meers Stor in the community of
the same name, a century-old trading post with fabulous hamburgers
the size of deflated footballs, and the surprisingly gorgeous
Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge, where a drive to the
top of Mount Scott takes you past roaming buffalo to a view
rivaling anything in the Texas Hill Country.
</P>
<P>
   In Duncan, Oklahoma's largest bronze sculpture sits in front of
the Chisholm Trail Museum. In Medicine Park, you can cool off in a
pretty old swimming hole and eat at the Old Plantation, within a
formerly grand resort. In Lawton, find frontier Army post exhibits
at the Fort Sill Museum, and the graves of Geronimo and other great
leaders at Chief's Knoll.
</P>
<P>
   5. EAT BIG IN THE SMALL TOWN: Plenty of down-home personality is
served at Garcia's and El Gordo, along with homegrown Mexican
flavors. McBride's Land &AMP; Cattle is the local favorite for an
old-fashioned steakhouse experience, while generations of
hardscrabble oilfield workers have sworn by the barbecue and red
draws (that's cold beer with a shot of tomato juice in it) at the
Deuce P2, though their wives and daughters weren't welcome until a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the most famous eatery in town might be the Bar-L, a dark
and blessedly chilly barbecue joint established in 1952. George
Strait and the Dixie Chicks blast from the jukebox, while the wait
staff hustles platters of giant ribs and ice-clad beer mugs, and
trades gossip (''Don't tell me he's in jail again!'').
</P>
<P>
   If he's of a mind, Star-Telegram sports columnist and WBAP
sports talk-show personality Randy Galloway will host his 6 p.m.
show some nights at the Bar-L.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   When NOT to go: Note that due to out-of-town exhibition games,
the Cowboys will be away Aug. 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 21 and 22.
</P>
<P>
   Comfy lodging outside of town is found in Bowie, 50 miles south
of Wichita Falls on U.S. 287, at The Gazebo Bed and Breakfast (
(940) 872-4852) and Old Tucker Homeplace Bed and Breakfast ( (940)
872-2484). In Archer City, 20 miles south of Wichita Falls on Texas
79, good choices are McMurtry's Lonesome Dove Inn ( (940) 574-2700)
and the historic Spur Hotel ( (940) 574-2501).
</P>
<P>
   In Wichita Falls: A visitor-information kiosk is located on the
training-camp site at MSU, and the Wichita Falls Convention and
Visitors Bureau can be found on the Internet at
www.wichitafalls.org. Or, call (940) 716-5500.
</P>
<P>
   Dining includes Garcia's (2925 Southwest Parkway, (940)
691-3724); El Gordo's (513 Scott St., (940) 322-6251); McBride's
Land &AMP; Cattle (501 Scott St., (940) 322-2516); Deuce P2 (1409 Lamar
St., (940) 766-1232); and Bar-L (13th and Lamar streets, (940)
766-0003).
</P>
<P>
   For a B&AMP;B stay, call Harrison House (2014 11th St., (940)
322-2299, lovely 1919 prairie-style home.
</P>
<P>
   Chain lodging choices include the usuals, from Hampton,
Fairfield and La Quinta inns to Motel 6, Hawthorn Suites and the
Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Still need more?: Call the Cowboys Hot Line in Irving, (972)
556-9308, or Wichita Falls, (940) 397-7777.

<P>
   The facts on the Falls: The destination of choice for discerning
football fanatics
</P>
<P>
   Population: 103,000
</P>
<P>
   Established: 1882, much to the distress of Caddo, Comanche,
Kiowa, Wichita and other previous residents
</P>
<P>
   Named for: A set of 5-foot-high falls on the Wichita River that
washed away in an 1886 flood but were replaced with a 54-feet-high
man-made one a century later.
</P>
<P>
   Climate: ``Hotter'n a two-dollar pistol,'' as the saying goes.
The typical high temperature this time of year is 97; the highest
temperature ever recorded in Texas was 120 on Aug. 12, 1936, in
Seymour, about an hour west.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest pre-Cowboys moments: The town boomed with the nearby
Electra oil strike in 1911 and the big one in Burkburnett in 1918.
Between 1910 and 1920, the population exploded from 8,200 to more
than 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lowest moment: Swindling took on Texas-size proportions when the
World's Littlest Skyscraper, downtown on La Salle Street, was built
using money from a $200,000 stock fraud in 1919. Newly rich
families invested in a building whose specs were detailed in
inches, not feet.

FOLLOW OUR GAME PLAN FOR A HOT TIME AT THE DALLAS COWBOYS TRAINING
CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ So what if it was 105 degrees at 4 p.m.
on Saturday? The devoted will come anyway, thousands a day, every
day for the next four weeks, hoping to get a glimpse, or even _
dare they dream _ the autographs of their beloved Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year, the Midwestern State University campus
hosts America's Team's summer training camp. It is a sensational
event that has this otherwise flat, sedate West Texas oil town 112
miles northwest of Fort Worth rolling out red carpets and seeing
green.
</P>
<P>
   The Falls is more than ready for Camp II, which began Monday
when rookies reported and shifted into full blast Wednesday with
the veterans' arrivals. A profusion of street signs bedecked with
blue stars and arrows directing the madding crowd to the TRAINING
CAMP joins bright banners on local businesses, welcoming players
and spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's monthlong Camp Cowboys drew about 120,000 fans, says
Robin Thompson Scales, director of the Wichita Falls Convention and
Visitors Bureau, who likes to note that six of 10 visitors came
from more than 50 miles away and that plenty stayed overnight. Best
of all, she says, those visitors had an economic impact of $6.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad for four weeks' work,'' Scales says. ```We'll take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the legions of fans will take it, too, despite heat-index
highs of 110 to 115 and elbow-to-elbow seating on metal benches.
But it's best to begin with a game plan.
</P>
<P>
   This in mind, we offer five best ways to survive Wichita Falls'
seasonal moment in the sun. Watch the Cowboys, but also get out and
see the sites. And don't forget the Coppertone.
</P>
<P>
   1. TACKLING TWO-A-DAYS: Whoever came up with the nutty idea of
practicing football in the heinous Texas heat, not once but twice
daily, was surely related to the head case who thought it would be
fun to ride a bike 100 miles in West Texas _ which 8,000 or so
enthusiasts will do here in late August at the Hotter 'N Hell
Hundred, but that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will indeed practice twice on most days, first from
8:45 a.m. until 10:45 a.m. and then from 4 until 6 p.m., through
Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no admission fee for fans, who watch the
proceedings from behind the fences surrounding the practice fields,
bring your wallet anyway, because you'll want to hit the concession
stands and the makeshift Cowboys pro shop (get your red-hot
T-shirts!). The team also offers a kids' game area called The
Dallas Cowboys Experience, where a small fee is charged.
</P>
<P>
   The players who sign autographs usually do so after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rookies tend to sign for any and everyone,'' says Maura Allen
Gast, a PR executive with the Irving Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau,
which helps with the Cowboys' media efforts. And some of the more
famous players will sometimes oblige. Last year, Gast says, Troy
Aikman had a system in which his ``handlers'' would hand out cards
_ ``to kids only'' _ numbered 1 through 25; those 25 kids were
instructed to go to a designated area after practice to meet the
quarterback and his Sharpie.
</P>
<P>
   2. SEE THE TOWN BY DAY: OK, so you have five hours to fill until
afternoon practice. Take the kids and your stacks of quarters to
the Plex Family Entertainment Center. Located near the campus, the
center has miniature golf, laser games, a gigantic outdoor
batting-cage facility, a huge video arcade, Go Karts and bumper
boats.
</P>
<P>
   Or a couple of blocks west of campus, find glorious escape in an
afternoon of first-run movies at the Sikes Senter mall's 10-screen
cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Those with more of a mind for fine cultchah can try the cool
environs of the Wichita Falls Museum and Art Center, directly
across from the MSU campus. There's a planetarium and laser-light
show, as well as an exhibit called ``Imagination Texas,'' an
interactive city for kids.
</P>
<P>
   In the restored, historic downtown, you'll find a few dozen
antiques shops (some with tearooms) as well as the Wichita Falls
Railroad Museum, and the Fire and Police Museum. Kell House Museum
is a renovated and spectacular 1909 home also nearby _ but then,
nothing in town is more than 10 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, you'll realize that this is the friendliest
town anywhere. Whether in restaurants or on the streets, locals
greet strangers with, ``Hidy, how y'all doin'?'' They don't expect
a reply; they're just nice like that.
</P>
<P>
   3. SEE THE TOWN BY NIGHT: This town was built during an oil
boom, and done so a good piece west of the Bible Belt. Translation:
There is no shortage of bars in Wichita Falls, most with live
country music and pool tables.
</P>
<P>
   The newest night scene, which sources say attracts plenty of
Dallas Cowboys, is Graham Central Station. Found about eight blocks
from camp, the five clubs under one roof include Denim and
Diamonds, a country music joint; a karaoke spot called Starz; Bell
Bottoms, a '70s/'80s disco-dance place; Paradise Beach, with more
dance music; and the Zone, a game room.
</P>
<P>
   For family fun, there's community theater at Backdoor Theatre in
a turn-of-the-century icehouse, as well as Wichita Theatre and
Opera House, with a ``Branson-style'' country-music show presented
on weekends inside the landmark that served as a vaudeville stage
and then the town movie house.

 &HT;    CONGRESS URGED TO LET STATES REGULATE GAMBLING DAY CRUISES
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    ATTN Florida papers 
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth urged a
congressional panel Wednesday to give states the power to regulate
gambling day cruises, but he faced warnings that a pending bill
would decimate the cruise industry and hurt a popular Sunshine
State port.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the impact of a 1992 law designed to give American
ships the same right as foreign-flagged vessels to operate cruises
in international waters with casino-style gambling often known as
``cruises to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a federal appeals court recently ruled that the 1992
law did not pre-empt state regulation, the ruling does not apply
outside the Carolinas, Maryland and Virginia . Butterworth said
courts with jurisdiction over Florida and most other coastal states
have mistakenly ruled that the law prohibits states from regulating
casino cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth urged a clearly skeptical Subcommittee on Coast
Guard and Maritime Transportation to support a bill by Rep. Frank
Wolf, R-Va., that would make it clear that states could regulate
casino cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the 1992 amendment allows floating casinos in
the state of Florida when the people three times in 21 years
rejected casino gambling,'' Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., a leading proponent of the 1992
change and the panel's ranking Democrat, argued that states have
the right to ban or limit casino cruises so long as the ban applies
to all vessels. He asked why the Florida legislature had not taken
advantage of the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you asking 'Big Brother' to save you from the Florida
legislature?'' Taylor asked. ``Why doesn't Florida do it if that is
really the will of the state of Florida?''
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth said no action had been taken because of the
gambling industry's political strength and lawmakers' concerns that
such legislation could give the Seminole Indian tribe ammunition to
argue that it should be allowed to operate casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Bullock, president of the Day Cruise Association,
asserted that if Wolf's bill is adopted, only American-flagged
vessels would be affected. He noted that efforts in the Florida
legislature to ban casino cruises have never made it out of
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Palm Beach Chairman Robert L. Williams told the panel
that the proposed bill would be devastating to the Florida port
where 20 percent of the income comes from casino cruises. Revenue
from such cruises doubled from 1997 to 1998 and is running 50
percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enactment (of the bill) would liquidate thousands of
cruise-related jobs and would hamper and curtail the current pace
of economic activity at the port,'' Williams said. ``It would be
devastating to our businesses, operation, and future development.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf indicated that if the transportation panel does not approve
his bill, he might try to attach it to the transportation
appropriations bill. He is chairman of the transportation
appropriations subcommittee.

PARENTS MUST PROTECT CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Aug. 5, 1999.)  
(nk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At my son's eighth birthday party, two of his classmates were
sitting in the kitchen talking to my husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why aren't you out there playing?'' he asked the two
second-grade girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys are doing boy stuff,'' they told him, ``you know,
football and wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, ``I see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a boy,'' one of them said. ``So you probably like that
stuff too. Although, you could have a sex-change operation and
become a girl. I saw that on Jerry Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   They both giggled.
</P>
<P>
   A sex-change operation. Hardly a topic of choice for a
second-grader's birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here we are. Even if my son has never seen daytime talk
shows, even if he has no idea what a sex-change operation is, you
can be sure a few kids in his class or day care or play group have.
And they, of course, believe in sharing this advanced knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   A friend and I were talking about child raising in the late
1990s, and we agreed that it feels like you're constantly trying to
hold back a storm surge of inappropriate images and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   How can you possibly screen all their conversations? Monitor
videos from someone else's overnight party? Stop the person in line
ahead of you from cursing a blue streak at the automatic teller?
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's the Internet. I have to make sure Adam's
not even in the room when I log on to my service provider, for fear
he'll read one of the XXX spam messages that has slipped into my
e-mail, such as ``Live Hot Bodies Do Bad Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if he's going to be exposed to all the abnormal stuff
before he even knows what's normal,'' I told my husband, as we
discussed which parental filtering program to buy.
</P>
<P>
   I have friends who try diligently to shield their grade-school
children, and have succeeded in protecting most of their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   And then I have friends who have given up. Some let their
elementary-aged children watch ``South Park;'' others routinely let
their youngsters watch R-rated movies that have gory violence and
explicit sex scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why bother? They'll see it sometime. Better to have them used
to it and seeing it here with us,'' said one father.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of kids just aren't ready for what they're seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Are we in such a hurry for our children to grow up?
</P>
<P>
   As writer Bill McKibben states: ``If one had set out to create a
culture purposefully damaging to children, you couldn't do much
better than America at the end of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent USA Today story about ``Raising Kids in Toxic Times''
quoted parents as saying their children were becoming
``artificially sophisticated: They talk like adults. They know
things like adults, but they're not. They don't know what's behind
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to Nielsen television ratings, more than a million
kids watch Jerry Springer on TV, including the 8-year-old in my
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, entertainment critics say, live in a materialistic,
media-sated culture, so where do we expect our children to live?
</P>
<P>
   But here's the thing: We're the parents. We can draw the line.
In fact, we can draw lines all OVER the place.
</P>
<P>
   And we should.

 &HT;    Surgeon General Issues Call To Action To Combat Suicide
 &HT;    997.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Surgeon General David Satcher, accompanied by
Tipper Gore and leaders of an Atlanta-based suicide prevention
network, on Wednesday issued a ``call to action'' to combat suicide
in America.
</P>
<P>
   Although suicide is the country's eighth leading cause of death
_ accounting for nearly 31,000 deaths in 1996, compared with about
20,000 homicides _ victims of life-threatening despondency are
often ashamed to seek help, Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief White House meeting, Satcher unveiled a national
strategy to increase research on suicide prevention and educate the
public on the causes and signs of impending suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must reduce the stigma of mental illness that keeps so many
people from seeking the help that could save their lives,'' Satcher
said at meeting at which he announced the suicide prevention
effort. ``People should not be afraid or ashamed to seek help.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher called on people he described as ``natural community
helpers'' _ such as religious leaders, teachers, hairdressers and
even Little League coaches _ to learn how to recognize the signs of
potentially fatal depression and intervene.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to actual deaths, about 500,000 Americans are
treated in emergency rooms every year after attempting suicide,
Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, Satcher was
accompanied by Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.,
Doris Smith, who is the president of the Atlanta-based Suicide
Prevention Advocacy Network (SPAN), and Chris Marshall, a
37-year-old Norfolk, Va., man who attempted suicide after years of
struggle with a mysterious condition diagnosed as panic disorder,
depression and ``social phobia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I was six years old, I knew something was wrong
with me,'' Marshall said. ``I had a deep sense of fear. I would get
dizzy and sweat and fear that I was going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he continued to suffer ``vicious and
humiliating panic attacks, over and over,'' a family doctor said he
was merely suffering from a ``case of nerves,'' which he would get
over.
</P>
<P>
   He said his parents worried constantly about him and took him to
specialists, but the drugs they prescribed didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he said, a succession of failures in college and
at various jobs, caused him to ``turn on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to live on my parents' farm, and after several months
with no relief from my symptoms, I could no longer take it,'' he
said. ``I became numb. On a starry night, I took my father's
shotgun and walked out onto a field. I was crying as I walked.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been plagued with ``visions of killing myself''
because of ``my sick brain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loaded the gun and held the barrel to my forehead. I could
not do it. By some grace, in a completely numb state, I was able to
grasp hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Marshall said, he met a young woman who encouraged him to
try medication again and finally an antidepressant drug began to
relieve the irrational fears that had plagued him nearly all his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have a good job and I'm getting married (to the girl who
encouraged him to return to medication) next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group most at risk is senior citizens, who account for 20
percent of all suicides, Satcher said. Reid described the day in
1984 when, as lieutenant governor of Nevada, he got a telephone
call from his mother, who told him, ``Your pop shot himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Present in the audience were Jerry and Elsie Weyrauch, the
Marietta, Ga., couple who founded SPAN 11 years ago, following the
suicide of their oldest daughter, Terri.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Smith read a suicide letter left by her son, Mark Allen
Smith, who shot himself in the head in 1992 in their Atlanta home,
while studying for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   A student leader in high school and college and a gifted
musician, Mark, ``although we didn't know it, was suffering from
depression,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret this had to happen on your birthday,'' he wrote. He
also apologized that he did ``not have more to say to you, other
than to say I love you very, very much and please tell my father I
love him too.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she ``did not know that depression was a disease that
could be treated or that you can get help.''
</P>
<P>
   She said after his death the family was shunned and was told
that ``blacks did not commit suicide'' and that ``if you commit
suicide, you will go to Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said suicide is ``not something that happens to other
people. It happens to people we know. It happens to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, join me in breaking the silence,'' she said to a
gathering of about 100 persons, most of whom seemed to be
associated with SPAN. ``Together we will save lives, replace stigma
with acceptance, ignorance with understanding and fear with hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he hoped a resolution which he and Reid introduced in
Congress several years ago would send a message to people that
``it's OK. It's all right to talk about our feelings of despair, of
hopelessness, of suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, we have to tell people that it's good to seek
help,'' he said. ``We must face this problem head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said the national strategy would involve such agencies
as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health
Resources and Services Administration, the Indian Health Service
and the National Institute of Mental Health, the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration, as well as private
groups like SPAN, the Ad Council, Ronald McDonald House Charities
and the American School Counselors Association.

DALLAS: WHERE `WRETCHED EXCESS' REIGNS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In typical Texas understatement, tourism officials
boast that the area offers ``more thrills than Disneyland, more
music than Nashville and more shopping than New York.''
</P>
<P>
   But they don't mention ``wretched excess.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Beverly Hills, however, probably no other city in the
nation exemplifies showy living and ostentatious displays of wealth
more than Dallas. Need proof?
</P>
<P>
   Start at the Mansion on Turtle Creek, a luxury hotel that
regularly ranks near the top of the list of the world's best in
travel magazine rankings. Located in a renovated Italian
Renaissance-style residence in the Oaklawn area near downtown
Dallas, the hotel's main rule seems to be that if you have the
money to stay there, they'll grovel with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Even though our mission was secret, every hotel staff member
seemed to be our new best friend within minutes after we checked
in. It's amazing what the perceived aura of having money will do.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after settling into our room, which at a special weekend
rate of $235 was probably the hotel's cheapest, a tray containing a
pitcher of fruit-flavored iced tea and carrot cake was delivered,
along with a handwritten welcome note.
</P>
<P>
   Other nice ``wretched excess'' touches during the stay included
a bucket of ice delivered with a fresh rose in a vase (there are no
serve-yourself ice machines); a big bathroom with more marble than
the Vatican; plush terry-cloth bathrobes for lounging; and a $22
lobster taco, listed by one national magazine as one of the 100
best things to eat in America, served poolside.
</P>
<P>
   However, there were some disappointments. Bathrooms included no
towel racks, so we had to hang wet towels over the shower rod like
at home. The soap dish was bolted to the vanity, apparently to
deter souvenir hunters, and skin moisturizer, bath crystals and
shampoo were in refillable glass bottles designed not to be taken
home.
</P>
<P>
   And _ dare we say it? _ there was a dead shrub on the patio.
</P>
<P>
   When we told the receptionist, she seemed positive that the
gardener could bring the bush back to life. If so, he should be
working at Lourdes instead of the Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop on our self-guided tour was the Crescent, a gray
stone fortress on the edge of downtown Dallas modeled after a
French chateau. The hotel/office/shopping complex designed by famed
architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee includes two pricey shops
that give new meaning to ``wretched excess.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Korshak is a stark-looking clothing store where overly
friendly salespeople eagerly offer drinks while you shop for a
$2,000 suit. Men's Health magazine recently named the store one of
the five best places to shop in America. Its advice: ``Make sure
you bring a 10-gallon wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   The interior of Stanley Korshak seems downright spartan compared
with Lady Primrose's Shopping English Countryside antiques store.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000-square-foot shop, the brainchild of oil heiress
Caroline Rose Hunt, is jammed with over-the-top collectibles,
ranging from antler chandeliers to a $6,000 music box. Upstairs, a
floral-patterned tea room has become a favorite gathering spot for
the ladies who lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Serious shoppers wouldn't think of missing the original Neiman
Marcus store in downtown Dallas. The ``mother ship'' of the upscale
speciality chain is not quite as impressive as it once was since
lavish retail stores have fled to the suburbs, but it's still
special.
</P>
<P>
   The multistory building has such touches as a shoeshine man in
the men's clothing department and elegant dining in the Zodiak Room
restaurant, where socialites who otherwise wouldn't dream of
leaving north Dallas come to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   A small museum on the fifth floor celebrates Neiman's glorious
92-year history. If you want to see what ``wretched excess'' was
really like, look at photographs of the store's Christmas interiors
in the 1940s and 1950s, and gaze at the Wall of Style, which
features such honorees as Princess Grace and Coco Chanel.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving the store, however, be careful about hopping into
the first car the valet brings. Our valet brought a silver Lexus,
the car-of-choice in label-conscious Dallas, and opened the door as
the engine remained running for our departure. We considered taking
off in it, but common sense prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   A large chunk of ``wretched excess'' remains at the Wendy and
Emery Reves Collection at the Dallas Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 15 years ago, Marshall native Wendy Reves gave the museum
$35 million worth of impressionist paintings, rugs, porcelain and
ironwork with one big string attached: She insisted the items be
displayed in a replica of the French villa where she and her late
husband, Emery, entertained such notables as Winston Churchill and
Greta Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   So museum officials spent $6 million to reproduce six rooms atop
the museum roof and display the items exactly as Reves instructed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained that the best paintings can hardly be seen
among the clutter of furniture, vases, books, silver door knockers
and even Churchill's cigars. And they howled over such touches as a
pair of Reves' slippers casually cast off on the floor at the side
of the bed in her reconstructed bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The museum director who approved Reves' demands is long gone,
but the collection remains a permanent part of the facility with
every item in place as she envisioned. On the day we visited,
however, no one else was viewing the Reves Collection. Long lines
of people waited downstairs to get a glimpse of the Stanley Cup,
the National Hockey League championship trophy won by the Dallas
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   While the locals go mad over ice hockey and are known to be
crazy about professional football, the real sport of Dallas is
shopping. So much so that Dallas Morning News columnist Maryln
Schwartz refers to a windowless mausoleumlike building that faces
NorthPark shopping center in north Dallas as the ``Tomb of the
Unknown Shopper.''
</P>
<P>
   The building, actually the Biblical Arts Center, is next door to
what the locals call Hillcrest Cemetery. Schwartz notes that some
shopping-crazed Dallasites have added provisions in their wills to
make sure their grave sites face the Neiman Marcus store across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   A fitting end for any ``wretched excess'' tour is the Mary Kay
Museum, located at the world headquarters of the gigantic
direct-sales skin care company.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, located in the stunning eight-story rose-and-black
marble atrium of a far north Dallas skyscraper, is a little gaudy
but fun, just like its founder and guiding spirit, Mary Kay Ash.
</P>
<P>
   Even though age and declining health has kept the Queen of
Cosmetics away from the office (a worker in the company cafeteria
says Ash hasn't been seen on the premises for a year and a half),
the museum holds a life-size Mary Kay mannequin and several of her
favorite gowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Mary Kay memorabilia also includes a porcelain doll
fashioned in her image and a bevy of diamond-encrusted bumblebees,
because the positive-thinking Ash often pepped up her sales team by
reminding them that, aerodynamically, the bumblebee shouldn't fly,
``but it does.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's piece de resistance is a 1967 pink Cadillac with a
heart-shaped rear window. Early on, Ash gave her top sellers pink
cars, which became a symbol of the company. People magazine once
labeled Ash the ``Mascarared Moses'' for leading her chosen people
to a land of furs, diamonds and pink Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   A stylish company cafeteria in the lobby leads to an attractive
dining area with goldleaf columns, mauve carpet and teak tables.
The cafeteria is open to the public and includes a carving station,
salad bar and an area piled with lavish desserts.
</P>
<P>
   The prices are inexpensive, and the food is high-quality, so pig
out and end the tour with this valuable lesson: ``Wretched excess''
doesn't always have to cost a lot.

TWO IMAGES DEFINE DALLAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mention Dallas to almost any adult in the world and two
images come to mind: an assassinated president and a television
show.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that two of the Metroplex's most popular
tourist sites are a memorial to John F. Kennedy and a homage to
J.R. Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixth Floor Museum, located in the School Book Depository
building where it is believed Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shot that
killed Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963, details the JFK presidency and
events surrounding the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, operated by the Dallas County Historical Commission,
opened in 1989 after much public debate. Some Dallas residents
opposed the establishment because they feared it would extend the
notorious reputation the city received from Kennedy's death.
</P>
<P>
   But now it draws more than 450,000 visitors each year, including
many young people who were not yet born when Kennedy was
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, impressively laid out in a 9,000-square-foot
loftlike space, includes historical photographs, documentary films
and artifacts such as an Associated Press teletype machine with the
first news bulletin of the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also examines various conspiracy theories, including
video footage of U.S. House of Representatives hearings in 1978
that concluded Oswald did not act alone.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department later determined there was no
conclusive evidence of a conspiracy and closed the case in 1988.
But a lot of people believe otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Sixth Floor Museum) basically tell you Oswald did it
and that's it,'' says John Nagel of the Conspiracy Museum, a
privately run exhibit located a few blocks away. ``We present the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Every weekend, Nagel guides visitors around the area and points
out inconsistencies with the Warren Commission report, which
determined Oswald acted alone.
</P>
<P>
   Nagel, who became interested in the assassination when he was 14
and has been studying it for 28 years, believes other assassins
shot Kennedy from behind a picket fence at the grassy knoll near
Dealey Plaza when the presidential motorcade passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to be the most scrutinized six seconds in our
country's history,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Other self-appointed tour guides also hang out outside the Sixth
Floor Museum hoping to guide visitors around the area for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   The tours usually stop at Dealey Plaza, across the street from
the school book depository building, where two bronze plaques set
in a low granite wall trace the route of the 1963 motorcade and the
day's events.
</P>
<P>
   Then they continue for two blocks to a Kennedy memorial that was
erected by the city and county in 1970. It was designed by noted
architect Philip Johnson and approved by Kennedy's widow,
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are put off by the stark memorial, which has
30-foot-high concrete walls and an open roof. Nagel explains that
Johnson designed it as a cenotaph, or empty tomb. The unfinished
look symbolizes Kennedy's unfinished life.
</P>
<P>
   A JFK historical bus tour offered by Gray Line Tours also takes
participants by the Oak Cliff apartment where Oswald lived and by
the Texas theater, where Oswald killed a Dallas policeman a few
hours after the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 miles away, near the suburb of Plano, hordes of
tourists travel to a site that is equally well-known around the
world, thanks to television.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 flags fly outside Southfork Ranch, representing the
countries where ``Dallas'' continues to be shown around the world.
The series, which appeared on CBS from 1978 to 1991, also is
repeated regularly on cable's TNN (The Nashville Network).
</P>
<P>
   Sally Peavy, supervisor of the Southfork mansion, says she has
escorted groups ranging from Romanian dignitaries to a convention
of urologists. A recent tour group included visitors from Great
Britain, New Jersey and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love to come here,'' she says. ``It rekindles a family
memory or childhood memory of watching the show that crosses
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour begins at an exhibit hall that features Lucy's wedding
dress, a convoluted diagram of the Ewing family tree and video
monitors that show classic ``Dallas'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   A tram takes visitors along a quarter-mile route, past grazing
longhorns, miniature horses and a 63,000-square-foot event and
conference center that is rented out for weddings and corporate
functions. The barn also houses a clothing store called Lincolns &AMP;
Longhorns, which features Jock Ewing's 1978 Lincoln Continental
Mark V, and an eating place called Miss Ellie's Deli.
</P>
<P>
   Once at the two-story, columned house, Peavy escorts visitors on
a folksy half-hour tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're welcome to take pictures. Just don't take our pictures
off the wall,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Each room in the four-bedroom, seven-bathroom home is decorated
in honor of characters in the television series, even though no
inside filming took place during the series. Only shots of the
outdoor pool, patio and exterior of the home were filmed here. All
interior scenes were filmed on a sound stage in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Peavy drops little tidbits about the filming of
the series. She explains that camera operators used a wide-angle
lens and mirrors to make the swimming pool look larger and points
out that it would have been impossible for the character Kristen to
fall from the upstairs balcony into the pool because they were too
far apart.
</P>
<P>
   She also explains that the ranch is located on 40 acres, not
100,000 acres, as it was in the show.
</P>
<P>
   The home, built by Joe Duncan in 1970, was picked for the show
after producers helicoptered over the area in search of the
perfect-looking locale for the series.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan sold the ranch in 1984. A subsequent owner went bankrupt
and, in 1992, the ranch was purchased for $2.6 million by its
current owner, Arizona developer Rex Maughn, who refurbished the
property. His company, Forever Resorts, is considering plans to
build a fancy resort hotel on the property.
</P>
<P>
   Peavy says the two most-asked questions are: ``Does anyone live
here?'' (No) and ``Does anyone sleep here?''
</P>
<P>
   She explains that only the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders are
allowed to stay overnight once a year, when they practice their
etiquette. Visitors taking a tour on that day get a kick out of
seeing the bikini-clad guests around the pool, Peavy says.
</P>
<P>
   As visitors leave the house, she cheerily offers these parting
words: ``Continue to watch `Dallas' so I'll still have a job.''

 &HT;    Ranch is No.1, pardner
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ranch dressing rules. The salad plate, the snack
basket, the pizza box.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, as ranch celebrates its 25th national anniversary
this year, it has become the No. 1 dressing, in no short thanks to
Texans. Only Florida has more cities on the Top 20 list of ranch
dressing dippers/pourers than Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Texans don't care that ranch dressing came from California, they
embrace it as their own. Is there a soul in the state who has not
ladled the blend of herbs, buttermilk and mayo on something _ from
lettuce to burgers to baked potato?
</P>
<P>
   There are no official figures for ranch use in Austin, but we
know it's a big favorite. ``We offer eight different dressings on
our 50-item salad bar and by far ranch is the most popular used,''
says Stefan Zuntag, a general manager of Souper Salad in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Texans also do some pretty strange things with it.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the state there is a cook who stirs ranch dressing
in her chocolate sheet cakes. We know because she sent the recipe
to a ranch dressing contest a few years back. Heck no, it didn't
win. Something about the combo turned the parsley in the dressing a
wild fluorescent green. The Hidden Valley Ranch folks are still
talking about that _ ah, creative _ soul.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is that business about Texans dunking slices of pizza
in ranch dressing. Hard to say where that came from, but I first
encountered the habit at Southwest Texas University in San Marcos
nearly two decades ago. Pretty odd, I thought, but look at how that
has caught on, even beyond the state line. One survey ranks pizza
dunking as the third most popular use, behind salads and
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Other enthusiasts have stirred ranch dressing into soup, potato
and chicken dishes, sprinkled it dry on popcorn and put it out as a
dip for chicken wings, fries and fresh veggies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, parents say they can get kids to eat just about
anything _ from fish to veggies _ if they serve it with a bowl of
ranch dressing. Those are sweet words to manufacturers, who, being
no dummies, have teamed up with other foods. Hidden Valley Original
Ranch alone has partnerships with Fresh Express salad mixes, Hormel
Bacon Bits, Pillsbury Potato Buds, Nabisco Thin Crisps and Pizza
Hut _ all spreading the flavor of ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the real ranch, the place sits empty today,
despite its soaring fame.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't always so. Hidden Valley Guest Ranch, the
birthplace of ranch dressing, once was a hot spot, especially with
fun-loving college kids who partied there in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Described by a former hand as part nightclub, part dude ranch,
the 120-acre spread near Santa Barbara, Calif., was owned by Steve
and Gayle Henson. Having played around with his salad dressing
recipe since earlier days in Alaska, Steve had a huge herd of
high-spirited human guinea pigs to test his kitchen efforts. And
the guests loved his ranch dressing so much _ some even ate it on
ice cream _ that many took it home in glass jars . One guest from
Hawaii wanted 300 jars for a party on Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have anywhere near the 300 or so jars he needed to
take all that dressing with him, so I told him to give me a few
hours while I prepackaged a bunch of envelopes with my mixture,''
Henson recalls. ``I told him how to use the mix to make the
dressing when he got back to Hawaii. He called a few days later
wanting more. He said everyone had gone wild over the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Henson developed a more exact formula for the powdered mixture
and started marketing the dressing by mail order. No jars or
bottles, just envelopes of the dressing mix. Business began to
grow, but the vans needed to ship the product were having trouble
negotiating the narrow roads leading to Hidden Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Henson moved the operation to larger quarters in Sparks, Nev.,
in 1972 and sold the business to Hidden Valley Food Products Co.,
which went national in 1974. Henson retired, although his son Nolan
stayed for three or four years after the sale. Neither is
associated with the product now, but both are participating in the
dressing's 25th national anniversary celebrations this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch dressing has grown from envelopes of powdered mix, blended
at home with mayo and buttermilk, to bottles. It has gone from a
remote ranch to Wendy's salad bars everywhere. It has become so
common that its name is no longer capitalized. And now it has
surpassed Italian dressing to become the champ.
</P>
<P>
   Call it successful indoor ranching.

   Three ways Texans use ranch dressing outside the salad bowl and
pizza box:
</P>
<P>
   Tortilla Spirals
</P>
<P>
   1-ounce envelope ranch dressing mix
</P>
<P>
   2 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened
</P>
<P>
   2 green onions, minced
</P>
<P>
   4 (12-inch) flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   4-ounce jar diced pimentos
</P>
<P>
   4-ounce can diced green chiles
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4-ounce can sliced black olives
</P>
<P>
   Mix dressing, cream cheese and onions. Spread on tortillas.
Drain vegetables and blot dry on paper towels. Sprinkle equal
amounts of vegetables on top of cream cheese. Roll tortillas
tightly. Chill at least 2 hours. Cut rolls into 1-inch pieces.
Serve with spirals facing up. Makes 3 dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch Trash
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (8 to 10 ounces each) mixed nuts
</P>
<P>
   14-ounce box Honey Nut Cheerios
</P>
<P>
   16-ounce box Quaker Oats Squares
</P>
<P>
   12-ounce box Rice Chex
</P>
<P>
   16-ounce box Wheat Chex

</P>
<P>
   Mix dry ranch dressing with oil. In a very large container or
clean trash bag, combine and mix all ingredients. Stir in dressing
mixture well. This recipe does not call for heating. However, if
you prefer the toasted flavor or if the weather is very humid and
the trash does not retain its crunch, it can be toasted on a large,
sided cookie sheet (in batches) or in a roasting pan at 350 degrees
for 15 minutes or longer, stirring every 5 minutes.

ORIGINS OF THE SWEET FIRST SOUNDS OF CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By BRUCE HEADLAM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading
nightly.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the first appearance of the word cyberspace, in William
Gibson's 1984 novel ``Neuromancer.'' It's well known that Gibson
conceived of cyberspace, which he defined variously as ``a graphic
representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer
in the human system'' and a ``consensual hallucination,'' before he
even used a computer: he wrote ``Neuromancer'' on a manual
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   What is perhaps less well known is that a large part of the
inspiration for ``cyberspace'' resulted from his first experience
wearing a Sony Walkman in the summer of 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had gone into a small neighborhood electronics store, never
even having heard of the Walkman,'' he said in an interview from
Vancouver. ``They had one on display and the guy told me, `You're
not going to believe this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had that immediate a reaction to a piece of
technology before or since. I didn't analyze it at the time, but in
retrospect, I recognized the revolutionary intimacy of the
interface. For the first time I was able to move my nervous system
through a landscape with my choice of soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately thought, `I have to have this,' although I
didn't have any money. I was poor back then and the Walkman cost
something like 350 Canadian dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson bought it anyway. But since he didn't own any cassette
tapes, he had a friend record some music for him. ``I took the
Walkman to downtown Vancouver,'' he said, ``listening to Joy
Division, which I had never heard. It gave Vancouver a kind of
weird totalitarian grandeur it hadn't previously had for me. I
didn't take that thing off for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   His conception of cyberspace, he said, arose after he saw a
bus-stop poster for the Apple IIc that showed only the machine's
CPU and keyboard, not its monitor. He became captivated with the
idea of how people might process data in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, if there is an imaginary point of convergence where
the information this machine handles could be accessed with the
under-the-skin intimacy of the Walkman, what would that be like?''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson no longer wears a Walkman. With success and money, he
said, he now has enough CD players to satisfy his interest in
music. But he is still fascinated with the idea of portable sound.
``It's almost a metaphorical realization of what we do anyway _ a
souped-up version of being lost in one's own thoughts,'' he said.
``Given the conditions in which most of us increasingly live and
the hard work required to obtain personal space, I think that's not
entirely a bad thing.''

FORT WORTH: ONE PLACE WHERE IT'S HIP TO BE SQUARE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent marks needed over a in Marton and a and o in Varo) 
 
By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sundance Square doesn't rate real high on
the ``hip quotient.''
</P>
<P>
   You're not likely to see cutting-edge couples strolling the
streets of the 20-block historical district in the middle of
downtown. Most people on a recent summer night were casually
dressed in shorts and polo shirts _ even when dining at the area's
nicest restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby streets are likely to be lined with Plymouth Voyagers and
pickups, far outnumbering the occasional Mercedes, Lexus or BMW
that strays into the area.
</P>
<P>
   But even without the glitz, Sundance Square is a major reason
why Fort Worth has the liveliest downtown in the state.
</P>
<P>
   While many U.S. cities are just now beginning to experience a
turnaround in their downtowns, Fort Worth's renaissance has been
going on for close to a decade.
</P>
<P>
   On most nights, the red-brick-paved sidewalks are jammed with
people going to movies, stopping for coffee, enjoying dinner or
browsing in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's a throwback to the 1950s and '60s, before people
fled to the suburbs, when a downtown area was the focal point of
shopping and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike San Antonio, where those meandering along the River Walk
are likely to be tourists, most of the people in downtown Fort
Worth live in the surrounding Metroplex area. Instead of traipsing
to a cheerless suburban shopping mall for entertainment, they flock
to the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the comforts of suburbia are here. There is plenty of
free parking, and the area feels safe with the presence of
benign-looking security guards. Two multiscreen AMC Theaters,
totaling 20 screens, show the latest movies to large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   A Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore takes up much of a city block. Even
toward midnight, it is full of people browsing among the books and
reading magazines next to a two-story-high faux bronze replica of
Frederic Remington's ``The Bronco Buster'' or sipping coffee in the
adjoining Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the locals prefer the Coffee Haus, an independent coffee
shop located a few blocks away with sidewalk tables and a menu that
includes Snickers cheesecake and Eskimoca, a nondairy frozen
caffeinated drink.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the area features several neighborhood pubs (the
Flying Saucer Draught Emporium seemed the busiest with its mix of
beer, billiards, cigars and live music), many restaurants, shops
and galleries.
</P>
<P>
   There is even one of the few urban outlet malls in the nation:
the Fort Worth Outlet Square features Spiegel, Nine West, Split
Rail, Samsonite and Radio Shack outlets. The corporate offices of
the Tandy Corp., which owns Radio Shack, are next door.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for the area's revitalization goes to the
Bass brothers, a prominent family that spearheaded the development
of a two-block stretch of restored 19th-century buildings in the
early 1980s. The area was named for the Sundance Kid, a compatriot
of Butch Cassidy who, legend has it, once hung out in nearby
saloons, gambling parlors and dance halls.
</P>
<P>
   While the brothers initially concentrated on the construction of
two high-rise office towers and a luxury hotel, Ed Bass turned a
row of downtown storefronts into Caravan of Dreams, a combination
jazz club/restaurant/theater with a casual rooftop grotto bar.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky building topped with a geodesic dome and cactus
garden is the closest thing the area has to an alternative space.
On a sultry summer night, patrons order a beer from a cave bar on
the roof and then settle in a lounge chair along a number of brick
terraces where they can view the crowds below.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent addition to the district is the Nancy Lee and
Perry R. Bass Performance Hall, a $65 million European-style opera
house that has won rave reviews since it opened last year.
</P>
<P>
   The most dazzling element of the hall _ home to the Fort Worth
Symphony, Fort Worth Dallas Ballet, Fort Worth Opera and the Van
Cliburn International Piano Competition _ is a pair of 48-foot-tall
angels on the front of the structure.
</P>
<P>
   The limestone angels, designed and sculpted by Marton Varo,
extend over the street five stories below and herald onlookers with
golden trumpets to their lips.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to view the angels is from the outdoor dining
area of a restaurant appropriately named Angeluna across the street
from the performing arts center.
</P>
<P>
   The chic restaurant, founded by the owners of Mezzaluna
restaurant in Aspen, Colo., has a sophisticated menu that includes
duck foie gras, stuffed brie, wood-grilled salmon and five-spice
duck. Yet the dress code is so casual that shorts are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   One resident says when Angeluna opened, it turned people off
because it was a little bit ``too Aspen.'' The owners toned down
the restaurant's attitude a bit, and it is now a popular gathering
spot.
</P>
<P>
   But if Sundance Square sounds a little too yuppiefied, then head
out to the Stockyards National Historic District, a few miles
northwest of downtown. Here it's easy to walk the brick-lined
streets of the area, which still looks much like it did at the turn
of the last century, and pretend you're in the west of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockyards once was teeming with real cowboys, who drove
their cattle to auction. At one time, it was the second-largest
stockyard in the country and home of the nation's two largest
meat-packing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now most of the authentic cowboys are gone. Tourists predominate
_ particularly the urban cowboy kind.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the area hasn't been sanitized beyond recognition. It
maintains a certain kind of rough authenticity. Parts of the
Stockyards look like a faded movie set, and there's horse manure on
the sidewalk, so watch your step.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go downtown and find the perfect kind of young yuppie.
Here it's dirty, and there's a little bit of (the smell of) beer,''
says Gayle Hill, who owns the Maverick Fine Western Wear and
Saloon.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who owns a general store in the Stockyards that sells
everything from rain wear and kerosene lamps to beer and ice cream
_ ``You can get a beer float, if you want,'' she says _ has seen a
lot of changes over the years.
</P>
<P>
   When she opened the General Store and Trading Post in 1983, she
recalls there were still a few livestock in pens down the street.
Now the building that housed the old hog and sheep pens is called
Stockyards Station and features 30 shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Hill opened her clothing store in a building originally
constructed in 1905 that previously was a private social club and
saloon. She kept the long oak bar as part of the boutique. She now
serves beer and Texas wine to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can shop till you drop,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Ward, a buyer of upscale ladies western wear for the
store, says local people often meet at the bar before going out for
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tourists just think it's fun,'' she says. ``You can shop
in here all day. The men don't mind sticking around.''
</P>
<P>
   Another establishment with a unique attitude is the White
Elephant Saloon, the scene of a famous 1887 gunfight between owner
Luke Short and former Marshal T.I. ``Long Hair Jim'' Courtwright. A
re-enactment of the duel takes place every Feb. 8. On most nights,
live bands perform.
</P>
<P>
   The infamous duo of Bonnie and Clyde once stayed at the
Stockyards Hotel, an authentic-looking three-story hotel built in
1907. The lobby is a throwback to another era, with red velvet
walls, tufted sofas, oak floors and a large staircase leading to
the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   The 52 rooms are decorated in four motifs _ Indian, western,
mountain man and Victorian. One of the Western rooms has a cowhide
headboard, a bleached skull on the walls and a nightlight made of
spurs.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to feel what it's like on a horse without riding
one, head to the hotel bar, Booger Red's Saloon, where saddles are
used as bar stools.
</P>
<P>
   Or walk over to Billy Bob's Texas, which is billed as ``the
world's largest honky-tonk.'' The 100,000-square-foot entertainment
center is a country-western amusement park of sorts for adults.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to live music every night with a big dance floor for
Texas two-steppin', the complex has a clothing store, ``cosmic
cowboy'' video games, pool tables and 40 bars.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, live bull riding takes place in an adjoining arena,
and icons of country music perform.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night, five business types threw caution to the wind
in a corner of the complex and decided to have their picture made
on a stuffed bull.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer covered their suits with chaps, bandanas and
cowboy hats and artfully arranged them on various parts of the
bull. Then she instructed them to holler, ``Yee haw!'' and snapped
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   After disembarking from the bull, the group huddled around a
computer screen to see the photograph. They eagerly shelled out $10
for a copy of their cowboy experience.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that what Fort Worth is all about?

ARTS ABROAD: PRAISE DOESN'T EQUAL FAME, BUT PLAYWRIGHT PERSISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 BY JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Tom Murphy, a soft-spoken, sometimes depressed
64-year-old writer from County Galway in the west, is in the view
of many critics Ireland's other great playwright _ that is, other
than Brian Friel.
</P>
<P>
   For though Murphy has written 25 plays in 37 years, and many of
them have been well received in Europe and the United States, he
has never had a popular and critical hit of the magnitude of
Friel's ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' or ``Philadelphia, Here I Come!''
Hugh Leonard, the author of ``Da,'' and of many comedies, who is
also of the Friel-Murphy generation, is also better known. None of
Murphy's plays have become films.
</P>
<P>
   And two younger Irish writers are more popular. Martin McDonagh
(``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') and Conor McPherson (``The
Weir'') have been filling theaters here, in London and in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy persists. His most recent play, ``The Wake,'' now at
the Abbey Theater, was actually written two years ago, after eight
years in which he wrote an adaptation but no original plays. Like
most of Murphy's plays, it is pleasing but also daunting critics
and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a difficult playwright to interpret for audiences and for
actors,'' he said in an interview Wednesday afternoon at his home
in the prosperous Rathgar section of Dublin. ``That's because the
thing that comes first for me is the emotions, the feeling. Life to
me is feeling. I try to tell a story, but I think that my kind of
writing aspires to the condition of music. Mamet, for example,
writes musically, takes four-letter words and turns them into
poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   The critic Fergus Linehan, former arts editor of The Irish
Times, called Murphy ``a great playwright'' and said: ``But he is
very far from the romantic. His work has a bitterness, a bleakness
that makes it less attractive to wider audiences. Tom has never had
a popular hit like Friel. People who never go to the theater
flooded to `Lughnasa.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``What Tom is saying is equally valid and universal.
But it is more difficult to come at.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are great, big, long convoluted speeches, and great
rolling floating clouds, lit by flashes of lightning,'' said
Linehan, whose wife, Rosaleen Linehan, one of Ireland's favorite
actresses, has performed in several Murphy plays and played Kate in
Friel's ``Lughnasa'' here, in London and on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Mason, the artistic director of the Abbey, who directs
``The Wake,'' said in an interview that Murphy is ``one of the
great playwrights of the Irish theater.'' He continued: ``He's up
there with Friel and Leonard. His work is characterized by
extraordinary inner intensity. He plays the music of the soul. He
has an extraordinary ability to record the inner sound of the
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom is one of the most challenging and idiosyncratic of Irish
writers. His theater is a theater of the extraordinary, often
violent, very disturbed, verging on the operatic. It makes
emotional demands on performers and audiences alike. But whatever
the demands, the rewards are extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wake'' is about a 40-ish Irish woman returning home to a
small town after years as a high-priced prostitute in the United
States, and her conflict with her scandalized, money-grubbing,
bigoted relatives. The woman, Vera, played by Jane Brennan, was
described as ``an Irish Blanche DuBois'' by the English critic
Michael Billington in The Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   The play, based on Murphy's only novel, ``The Seduction of
Morality,'' has raucous, sometimes dark humor. The only Protestant
character, an alcoholic, jokes at his own failure to reform: ``I
have nothing to declare but my schizophrenia,'' an allusion to
Oscar Wilde's wisecrack as he arrived at Customs in New York: ``I
have nothing to declare but my genius.'' The play is to move this
summer to the Edinburgh Festival.
</P>
<P>
   One of Murphy's highly praised works, ``Conversations on a
Homecoming,'' is about a man returning to tell huge lies about his
success in America. One of his most harrowing plays, ``Famine,'' is
about how the Irish suffered in the potato blight of the 1840s. Not
only are the English colonial rulers shown to be guilty of
inaction, but also Clancy, a wealthy Catholic merchant, refuses to
help the starving, although the catastrophe reduced Ireland's
population to three million from nine million.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say that Murphy's best play is ``The Gigli
Concert,'' in which an untalented real estate developer seeks the
help of a phony singing teacher to help him sing like Beniamino
Gigli, the acclaimed Italian opera tenor who died in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the play, which is Murphy's favorite, the
teacher, who winds up learning to sing better himself, says to his
pupil: ``I longed to take myself captive and root myself, but you
came in the door with the audacity of despair, wild and with an
idea of wanting to soar, and I was the most pitiful of spiritless
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The audacity of despair, Murphy said, helps him create. ``I
undergo forms of depression,'' he explained. ``I know about
depression. How do you write about depression? I wake up in the
morning sometimes and I'm in a good humor. Or I'm in bad humor, or
I'm in between, at the whim of Life slash God. I resent being the
victim of Life, so I say: `OK I can do it too. I can decide what
sort of mood a character is in.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When he is not depressed, which is most of the time, Murphy
smiles now and then, makes coffee and says he is getting restless
because he has finished a new play and has not written much since
April. The new play, ``A Little Love, a Little Kiss,'' a story of
Irish emigrants returning home, is to be produced at the Abbey next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the writers who have influenced him, he said, are the
American philosopher William James and the playwrights John
Millington Synge, Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams and Arthur
Miller. He added about Miller, ``But I can't stand all that
moralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that his writing had been helped, years ago, by
watching his children playing doctors and nurses. ``Their
playacting _ it's as if they were already translating their
feelings into an art form.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Friel are ``old, old friends,'' he said, without a trace
of envy or jealousy of Friel's success. ``Brian does his thing,''
he said. ``I do my thing.''

 &HT;    History surrounds town that dried up due to a well
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE GROVE _ Hot and tired after a hard day in the saddle, the
four of us rode into town from the west, dismounted and went into
the general store.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 121 years earlier on another hot July day, the legendary
outlaw Sam Bass and his boys also rode into town from the west on
the same road. They also dismounted and walked into the the town's
general store.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Bass and his cohorts picked out various foodstuffs from the
store's shelves and bins and ate their meal in the store.
</P>
<P>
   The store owner, W.J. Graham, didn't know the men.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men got up and walked over to Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you do,'' the stranger asked, ``if Sam Bass walked
in here and told you to give him all your money?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell him to go to hell,'' replied the storekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you say if I told you that you're talking to Sam
Bass right now?'' asked the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'd say that's a different matter,'' said Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Bass and his men laughed at Graham's response.
</P>
<P>
   The outlaws finished their meal, mounted up and continued east
to Salado and Round Rock where banks waited to be robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Bass never made it back to Graham's store. Tipped off, Texas
Rangers fought a fierce gun battle with Bass, who is buried in the
Round Rock cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   W.J. Graham told this story to his grandson, J. D. ``Unc''
Graham whose Planters State Bank in one corner of the general store
was robbed in 1927 by bank robbers who pulled up in a Model T Ford,
walked past seven men sitting on a bench outside the current store
and walked out a few minutes later with $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to picture the men sitting on the bench outside the
store where our motorcycles are parked and where the same bank
remains in the same corner of the store.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in the middle of the same dusty street, is the water
well that Sam Bass and his men rode past. Some people say the well
killed the town.
</P>
<P>
   The Grove, named after a clump of live oak trees, was founded
alongside a buffalo trail by Wendish colonists in the mid-1800s.
They dug a 28-foot well that became an unending source of fresh
water and pride.
</P>
<P>
   The town grew and traffic grew along the road that connected
Gatesville and Temple. The well sat, and still sits, right in the
middle of the road.
</P>
<P>
   When the highway department decided to build a nice new road
through The Grove in the 1930s, the engineers said the well had to
go. The townspeople said no.
</P>
<P>
   State Highway 36 went around The Grove. Slowly but surely,
businesses began to close.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Austin antique collector Moody Anderson happened
into town, the town's bank, post office, doctor's office,
blacksmith's shop, cotton gin and Masonic Lodge were closed. J.D.
Graham and his general store were just hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson spotted a wealth of antiques in the store. ``Every time
I tried to buy something, the old man said, 'It's not for sale,'''
Anderson told us as we relaxed over cold soft drinks in the
Cocklebur Saloon next door to the old general store. Except for the
well out front, the town is dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally gave up and got in my car and started to leave when
I had an idea,'' Anderson said. ``I went back inside and offered to
buy the building and all its contents. He sold everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson bought other old buildings in town and moved in a
lifetime collection of antiques.
</P>
<P>
   The Grove is a trip back in time. It is open for tours on
Saturdays and Sundays for $2 a head. It also can be rented for
private parties or movie sets, which doesn't sit too well with some
of the descendents of people who dug the town's well.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop Thursday
across parts of the Middle Atlantic states as a pool of cold air at
19,000 feet moving over hot, humid air near the ground destabilizes
the atmosphere. A few thunderstorms will approach severe levels,
with strong winds posing a threat. Heavy rain and street flooding
are also possible.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will affect parts of the Great Lakes
and the Ohio Valley, as hot, humid air from the southwest is forced
to rise over pockets of rain-cooled air left over from Wednesday's
storms. Meanwhile, isolated, potent thunderstorms will erupt over
the Southeast in response to instability created by hot air near
the ground and cooler air filtering south at high altitudes.
Downpours are likely in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   A few thunderstorms will erupt over parts of the Tennessee and
middle Mississippi Valleys in response to uneven heating along
boundaries between rapidly heated air and pockets of cooler air
left in the wake of Wednesday's storms.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop
across much of the Rockies as moisture streaming north from the
tropics at 10,000 feet combines with the uneven heating of
mountains and valleys to generate currents of rising, moist air.
Isolated storms will develop in California's northern Sierra Nevada
and Oregon's Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated thunderstorms will patrol the Gulf Coast from northeast
Texas to Florida as the leading edge of the sea breeze presses
inland and lifts hot, humid air.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Summer in the City
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the mercury hit 95 degrees in Central Park in New
York City, marking the eleventh time this month with temperatures
of 95 degrees or more. This tally of 95-degree days sets the
all-time standard for any month in the Big Apple. Though there have
been pockets of extreme heat in July, this summer, nationally
speaking, is not yet in a league with some of the record hot
summers of the past. During the summer of 1936, when there was
widespread, protracted heat, Kansas City recorded 53 days with
temperatures over 100 degrees, a benchmark for hot summers.

ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT AND PRONE TO BICKERING, DALLAS AND FORT WORTH
ARE FLOURISHING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When checking into the Mansion on Turtle Creek, the
toniest hotel in Dallas and one of the ritziest in the world, a man
remarked that his flight from Houston was bumpy and the plane was
old. (That's what the Southwest Airlines flight attendant said to
explain the lack of overhead storage space.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a pilot?'' the hotel receptionist, dressed in a
dramatic black pants outfit and designer glasses, asked
nonchalantly, as if everyone owns a personalized Lear jet.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Dallas, where image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, over at the Maverick Fine Western Wear and
Saloon in the Fort Worth Stockyards, owner Gayle Hill lamented the
fact that her part of the world has cleaned up its act over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that two decades ago, the fancy hotel across the
street was a ``two-bit flophouse'' and the ladies of the evening
stole items from a drugstore she owned at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '70s, there were some old-time scum-bag bars and some
colorful characters around here,'' she said. ``When I think of it
that way, I kind of miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``It's still pretty authentic out here,'' she said.
``We still have some cowboys and down-and-out poets. It's not
Disneyland, knock on wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Fort Worth, where down-home style remains a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Like a mismatched couple trapped in a rocky marriage, Dallas and
Fort Worth are constantly at odds. Folks in Fort Worth often
consider their Dallas counterparts ``uppity'' (one joke goes like
this: What are the two cities in north Texas? Fort Worth and Fort
Worthless) while many Dallasites have been known to look down upon
their Fort Worth brethren as unsophisticated rubes.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the bickering comes from their backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Established on a high bluff overlooking the Trinity river in
1849, Fort Worth was once a rowdy frontier town that served as a
way station for cattlemen driving their herds north on the Chisholm
Trail. When the railroad arrived in 1876, the city served as a
major shipping point for cattle and became known as ``Cowtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Though few real cowboys remain, the city has latched onto its
western heritage with gusto. Officials recently inaugurated a daily
cattle drive as part of the celebration to mark the city's 150th
birthday and tout the Stockyards National Historic District as an
authentic Old West experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of it,'' said Gil Stotler, director of
communications for the Fort Worth Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
``This is where the West begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, founded as a trading post in 1839 by a Tennessee lawyer
named John Neely Bryan, has long touted its image as a
sophisticated business, banking and retail center.
</P>
<P>
   Glitzy yet conservative, the city also established itself as a
leader in the areas of fashion, convention business and
transportation, particularly after the gigantic Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport opened in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   While seeking to highlight a haute image _ its tourism
information is sprinkled with the phrase, ``Dallas! The Texas
Star'' _ two events have defined the city in the eyes of the world:
the assassination of John F. Kennedy, which left a black mark on
the city's name, and the hit television series ``Dallas,'' which
rehabilitated it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dallas and Fort Worth are different, the two cities
are joined at the hip by location and the desire to impress the
world.
</P>
<P>
   While they argue about everything from who has the better
symphony hall to whether plans to expand Love Field will sabotage
the future of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, they have
too much at stake to divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Located 30 miles apart, they are bookends of an area known as
the Metroplex. Once a wide-open prairie, the area is now an endless
mass of suburban sprawl wedged between the two vastly different
cities.
</P>
<P>
   To suspicious Houstonians, the Metroplex seems nothing more than
an artificial term honchos in Dallas and Fort Worth devised to
stake a claim as the state's largest metropolitan area since
neither could claim the title on its own.
</P>
<P>
   While Houston remains the nation's fourth-largest city, with
more than 1.7 million, trailed by Dallas (No. 9 at a little more
than 1 million) and Fort Worth (No. 29 at just over 491,000), the
combined greater Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area totals more
than 4.5 million, edging out Houston and its surroundings at about
4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber of commerce types began looking for a comprehensive name
for the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 1972 to tout it in a national
advertising campaign. Marketing studies indicated the term
``Dallas-Fort Worth'' lacked sizzle, according to an account in the
Dallas Morning News. And too many people thought ``North Texas''
meant Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   So advertising agent Harve Chapman coined the word from
``metropolitan'' and ``complex,'' and it took hold, even though
it's still not listed in Webster's New World Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays just about everybody knows the term refers to the area
of the state stretching from the eastern outskirts of Dallas to the
western environs of Fort Worth, including everything in-between.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the roadside that links Dallas and Fort Worth has that
new and vaguely familiar suburban feel surrounding any major U.S.
city. There are gleaming new high-rise buildings, endless new
housing developments and familiar business names: Pappasito's,
Joe's Crab Shack, CarMax, Target, Ninfa's. If you didn't know
better, you might think you're still in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   However, some things are unique to the Metroplex, such as
wretched excess; a touch of the wild, wild West; the liveliest
downtown in Texas (and maybe the whole United States); and a rail
system that works.
</P>
<P>
   The Metroplex is not exactly Hollywood, but it has a movie
studio.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly Napa Valley, but it has wineries.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly Utopia, but it has some eye-popping sights
worth seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Within the pages of this section, come along for an
unconventional ride.

 &HT;    Minister risks others' wrath just by offering to talk
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ This was news.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 20th century, this was news. Way past the fall
of the Berlin Wall, nearly a generation past desegregation, years
into the information age, when more people are connected in more
ways than once imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The news: A Baptist minister proposes a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   It made most newspapers. It made this newspaper. A former
president of the Southern Baptist Convention told a convention of
fellow Christians that it was time to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking past each other and it's time we talked to
each other,'' said the Rev. Jimmy Allen, who for most of the 1970s
led the world's largest Protestant denomination. He was speaking to
a convention of the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community
Churches, the world's largest homosexual church.
</P>
<P>
   Allen doesn't speak for us, assured the Southern Baptist home
office.
</P>
<P>
   What the reverend proposed is pretty dangerous. It's one thing
to talk to someone. It's another to talk with someone, which is how
dialogue is committed. Left uncontrolled, dialogue might spread.
Uncontrolled, understanding can run rampant.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wouldn't be understanding about what makes homosexuals
what they are, or for that matter, how heterosexuals are what they
are.
</P>
<P>
   No, this understanding would embrace what enemies often discover
during cease-fire on smoldering battlefields as the dead and dying
are hustled away: The enemies discover their common humanity, their
utter lack of reason to hate one another.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Southern Baptist war room, a spokesman asserts that
Allen sends dangerous signals, that he may be ``forwarding the
agenda'' of the people he was addressing.
</P>
<P>
   Can Allen be helped, reprogrammed? It appears not. He's stopped
looking at people as pegs on a map. He's started looking at them as
people, even those with a sexual orientation he can't fathom.
</P>
<P>
   This came in part, Allen said through tears, because of a son
who is gay and has HIV. It also came because he watched fellow
Christians shun his own flesh and blood, his grandsons and his
daughter-in-law. Through blood transfusion she had contracted AIDS
and transmitted it to three boys. All three died.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's other son was pastor of a church in Colorado. He got
fired when word got out that his wife and sons were infected.
Another church turned the boys away when they sought to attend
Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   As Jimmy Allen has made his journey from prejudice to at-peace
with facts of life he can't understand, I hope he hasn't beaten
himself up over his reasons. No doubt he's now realizing that there
was selfishness behind his breakthrough. His son, his son's friends
_ he was defending them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it takes, I say. Ronald Reagan liked to make strawmen
of those with the ``gay agenda,'' then realized he'd been
dialoguing with a gay man, had invited him to the White House, and
thought the world of him. When Rock Hudson died of AIDS, Reagan
turned down his volume of judgment.
</P>
<P>
   You see, that's why some people are repulsed by suggestions of a
dialogue, because they know where that leads _ to toning things
down.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly you won't hear the TV preachers, commanders of the
airwaves, toning it down. They will, rather, turn it up.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin Wall is down. The Red Menace has evaporated. How to
martial the troops, to raise the dollars to pay for godly
microwaves? The ``gay agenda,'' of course.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be news, that a pastor, a man of God, would be
talking about a dialogue with fellow believers. But since for some
people the whole dynamic of belief means forming distinct groups
that spend a lot of time focusing on distinctions, I guess what
Allen has done is unusual. Whether or not it is ungodly, you make
the call.

   With Armada M300, Compaq Returns to Ultralight Market
</P>
<P>
   Compaq was one of the first computer makers to develop a really
light laptop, the Aero, but it was a laptop before its time and it
did not sell. This week, the Houston company returned to the
ultralight category with the Armada M300.
</P>
<P>
   Although it weighs only three pounds, the M300 has an 11.3-inch
screen and an almost full-size keyboard. And although it is just an
inch thick, it retains all the connectors on the back, so no
external port replicator is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Many owners of ultralight laptops have complained that to reduce
the weight, the printer and especially the serial port were
removed. The M300 comes with either a Pentium II or Celeron chip
running at 333 megahertz, 64 megabytes of RAM, and up to a
6.4-gigabyte hard drive. The units are to be shipped in August and
start at $1,999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the first ultraportable to the market, but it is one
of the best to get to market,'' said Cheryl Currid, president of
Currid and Co., a Houston technology consulting firm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One external device that potential buyers might consider is the
M300's portable docking station. Compaq calls it the mobile
expansion unit. Its advantage is that it provides a disk drive and
a multibay slot for a CD-ROM, DVD, an LS-120 drive, another hard
drive or another battery.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still necessary to carry around the extra devices,
there are not any cables to lose.

<P>
   Can Web browsing be hazardous to your health? A recent
ergonomics study suggests that it can be, even more than other
computer tasks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study of 24 surfers by the ergonomics specialists
Anthony D. Andre and Jeff English, surfing can be particularly
dangerous because it tends to be more of a leisure activity and
people are less aware of their posture and the position of their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   For example, surfers tend to lean away from the mouse, which
puts extra strain on the wrists and elbows. Web page scrolling
forces users to keep constant pressure on the mouse-click button,
which can strain the fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that few participants took advantage of the
natural waiting periods of page downloads and instead kept their
hands on the mouse, a position the report called a ``mouse
freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which will be presented at the Human Factors and
Ergonomics Society's annual convention in September, recommends
that surfers move closer to the mouse, change position during
downloads, use a scrolling mouse and not lean on their nonsurfing
arm.
</P>
<P>
   And until there is an ergonomic study on the hazards of turning
pages, they could always read a book.

   You can now talk to your Palm III, sort of. Landware
(www.landware &QL; 
.com) introduced the GoVox digital voice recorder at the Macworld
Expo in New York last week. The GoVox recorder, which attaches to
the Palm in place of its lid, allows you to dictate short notes,
memos or reminders.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder is not linked so recordings cannot be translated
directly into text. Speech recognition is still a dream for Palm
owners. For now they must play back their words.

   Free Hard Drive Service Is Available on Internet
</P>
<P>
   A start-up company in Santa Monica, Calif., is offering a free
desktop hard drive service on the Internet. But, like many
Manhattan apartments, the virtual hard drive does not come with a
lot of storage space.
</P>
<P>
   Founded this year, X:drive (www.xdrive.com) will give users 25
megabytes of remote hard drive space that is accessible from any
computer with Internet access. The service is intended for users
with high-speed access to the Internet, so those using modem access
might find X:drive slow, especially with large files.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most previous Internet-based file storage services,
X:drive is not on Web browsers for PC users. Instead, a special
application for Windows 95/98 that creates a hard drive desktop
icon to represent the virtual X:drive can be installed.
</P>
<P>
   Users can save documents directly to the drive or drag and drop
files as they would to a C or A drive. Users of Macintosh and other
platforms must use the slower Web-based interface.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of multigigabyte hard drives, 25 MB can hold only a
few MP3s and a handful of Power Point documents. If you outgrow the
allocated free space, $4.99 a month will buy an additional 25 MB.

   Do Violent Games Sell? Well, Not Necessarily
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the high school shootings in Littleton, Colo.,
the video game industry has been the focus of complaints by
politicians and activists, who contend that its products cause
real-life violence. But recent sales figures indicate that violent
video games are not as pervasive as some believe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics compiled by PC Data, Inc., of Reston,
Va., the best-selling games are relatively free of violence. Doom
and Quake, often cited as examples of violence-laden games, have
combined sales of 4.7 million copies, while Myst and its sequel
Riven, which are relatively nonviolent, have sold 5.5 million
copies. The initial games of both series were released in 1994. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The less violent SimCity series _ SimCity, SimTower, SimEarth _
has sold more than 7 million copies since its release in 1989. The
current version, SimCity 3000 has sold nearly a million copies
worldwide since its release in January of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other perennial best sellers are card games, flight simulators
and chess. The ChessMaster series alone has sold more than 4
million copies since 1986.

   This from the why-didn't-somebody-think-of-this-sooner file:
Compaq recently filed a patent for an ingenious keyboard that uses
the typing motion itself to recharge laptop batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is finding an easy and efficient way to convert the
kinetic energy from typing into electrical energy to run a
computer. Adrian Crisan, a Compaq software engineer, came up with a
conversion mechanism that uses tiny magnets that are attached to
the shaft of each key. When keys are pressed, the magnets move
through wire coils that surround them.
</P>
<P>
   The motion of the magnets induces tiny currents which,
aggregated, charge a capacitor. In turn, the capacitor builds up
charge to recharge the laptop's battery.
</P>
<P>
   While the magnets, coils and charging mechanism will add to the
cost of a computer, the economics of the keyboard have not
completely been determined. Given the instant message habits of
some users, the technique could lead to a kind of perpetual typing
motion machine.

   Software to Translate Between Mac and PC
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when Brian Landwehr was trying to sell software
that enabled PCs to read Macintosh floppy disks, people probably
thought he was crazy. Here was a product based on two technologies
that surely would soon vanish: Apple computers and floppy
diskettes.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Apple has resurged, floppies are still around
and Landwehr has a new version of his product called MacDrive 98
Version 3. ``Trading files via removable media isn't going away any
time soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MacDrive is a software that can be installed on any Windows PC
to prevent incompatibility problems with removable disks that were
formatted on an Apple computer, including floppy and Zip disks.
</P>
<P>
   People who use the software can put a Mac disk in a Windows
machine and gain access to the files as if they were on a PC disk _
without getting annoying error messages or confusing requests for
reformatting.
</P>
<P>
   Landwehr said the software, which sells for $64.97, is already a
hit with parents who have children using Macs at school and PCs at
home. It can be ordered over the Web, at www.media4.com.

 &HT;    Mourning the death of a fine attorney
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ A good man died too young last week. John
Mitchell, the district judge in San Augustine, died while on
vacation in Mexico. He was 51. It's unclear if he drowned or
suffered a heart attack. Whatever happened, that little county will
feel his loss, as of course will his friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   My first dealings with John came about a week after I moved
there in 1982 to run the ``San Augustine Rambler,'' a tiny weekly
in a town that had two newspapers and 3,000 people. He was city
attorney then, and just a few days after my arrival I covered a
city council meeting where the council blatantly ignored the Open
Meetings Act and went into secret session, just like they'd been
used to doing. I challenged them for doing so, wrote a scathing
editorial about it, and in that editorial pointed out that Mitchell
hadn't said anything to the council about their disregard for the
laws of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It made a bit of a wave, this wet-behind-the-ears newcomer
raising sand not long after getting the U-Haul unpacked. Further, I
was renting a house from the mayor, who lived next door. Eviction
seemed a possibility, though my fears proved misplaced. I was
nervous, being all of 26 years old, as to how my diatribe would be
perceived, especially when John was the Rotary Club speaker the day
after the paper came out. He was giving a talk on estate planning,
as I recall. I was covering it for the paper, Rotary Club speeches
being newsworthy in a town where not much happens day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   I stood up to take his picture to go with the story, and John
stopped, grinned and drawled that he hoped his coverage in ``The
Rambler'' was going to be a bit more favorable next week than it
had been this week. I realized then that I was dealing with someone
a cut above the usual small-town lawyer. The city council, to my
knowledge, never broke the rules after that, and John and I soon
became friends.
</P>
<P>
   Not close friends, understand, but we ran in the same circles
and hung out at various small-town events _ barbecues, the
livestock show, the annual trip to Houston for the rodeo and
cookoff. John and his wife, Lucy, gave the best parties in the
county, held at the old San Augustine railroad depot, which they
had bought and moved onto their farm.
</P>
<P>
   I admired John from somewhat of a distance. He was a hometown
boy who went off, got a law degree from the University of Texas,
married a fine woman and came home to practice small-town law and
help run the family title company. His brother, Charles, now
district attorney, joined not long after. During those dark years
when the Aggies kicked our tails every season, John, Charles, the
Oglesbees and me were the few Teasips in a town dominated in its
college alumni ranks by Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   John seemed to instinctively know how to be a small-town lawyer,
when to hold them and when to fold them. He effected that slow,
Southern speech and deliberate way of speaking and found so much
about life in a small town to be humorous, without being mean or
malicious about it. There was no doubt he genuinely loved that town
and its people, foibles and all.
</P>
<P>
   He and Lucy and their kids lived in town in a fine old house,
and he raised cows on the family place a few miles out of town. I
can blame him and then-County Judge Jack Nichols for me getting a
wild hair and buying cows once in a misguided fit of romanticism,
though it didn't take me long to realize I had about as much
business raising cows as I would have doing brain surgery. They
grew up in the business, and I was a dumb rank amateur.
</P>
<P>
   I rarely saw John in the past 10 years, once or twice as best I
can recall. My life had changed _ a busy job and different family
obligations. I always had it in the back of my head to sneak across
the river sometime and watch him run a courtroom, a job he'd won
since I left 12 years ago. Unfortunately, I never got around to it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm confident he was a fine judge. He had the level-headedness
and intellect, combined with the earthy common-sense that it takes
to dispense justice. I'm sure he found humor in much of what he saw
pass before his bench and that he had compassion when it was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much else to say, other than I mourn for the pain
his death causes his family and friends. It's a cliche that only
the good die young, but damned if it doesn't seem to be true.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For some, crosswords are part obsession and part self-torture, a
kind of mental steeplechase. For others _ and I am one, even though
I am not particularly adept at them _ they are merely a pleasant
diversion, an afternoon jog, that stimulates the mind while
exercising it.
</P>
<P>
   For teachers and parents, crosswords can be a wonderful teaching
tool. Social studies teachers create puzzles based on historical
facts or geographical details. Language-arts teachers use crossword
puzzles to test vocabulary or reading comprehension. The crosswords
can also be used by parents and teachers to create puzzles with
holiday or other themes. Birthday parties can include puzzles with
facts about the guest of honor, like ``friend of Beavis (8).''
</P>
<P>
   Since it can be hard to make a puzzle work in the crossword's
characteristic grid of black and white squares, software can be a
great help. Many of the available programs will let users import
graphics or customize the layout to produce crossword-based cards
and invitations (guests must complete the puzzle to uncover the
details of the event). Many programs also let users put their
puzzles on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   With many programs to choose from, you should be clear what you
are looking for before you purchase. Some programs excel in layout
and personalization, while others include large dictionaries to
help you come up with word options. Some programs are geared more
toward helping you solve puzzles rather than toward creating them.
Most create puzzles that can be solved on a computer or printed out
and worked on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that no program can be brilliant or clever for you.
While the program can provide the basic design, the real genius of
crossword creation is ultimately up to the creator.
</P>
<P>
   CROSSWORD STUDIO 3.0
</P>
<P>
   Nordic Software, $49.95
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95, 98 or Macintosh OS 7.0 and later
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in reading a software program's manual _ until I
encounter a problem. Within a few minutes of starting Crossword
Studio, I sought expert help because the program appeared
impossibly limited.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as I found out, I was correct. This is a program
that is missing the bells and whistles we have come to expect from
well-designed software.
</P>
<P>
   Crossword Studio's screen hides the Windows desktop so toggling
between programs requires using the alt and tab keys
simultaneously, a shortcut that computer novices may not know. That
is a particular problem because the program relies on cutting and
pasting sounds, graphics and words from other software programs
into your puzzle to enhance it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to import a word list, the user must go into a word
processing document, copy the list and then open Crossword Studio
and paste the words and solutions into the puzzle, using keyboard
controls. The alt-tab function gets a seemingly unnecessary
workout. There are only two pull-down menus in the main screen, and
their functions are mostly related to saving, copying and printing.
The user must exit the program to get access to the user manual.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows automatic or custom creation modes. In the
automatic mode, you provide the program with a list of words and
clues, and the program will place them in a puzzle grid for you. In
the custom mode, you pass quickly through the word-entry step and
proceed to the grid, where you can type in words in the pattern of
your choice. The custom grid is a good option because the program
has such limited functions, but it is just as difficult as creating
a puzzle on graph paper.
</P>
<P>
   If its lack of sophistication does not bother you, the program
does offer some useful features. For teachers and parents, there
are 100 already-designed puzzles available on a variety of topics,
from Amelia Earhart to fitness. They are divided into three levels
of difficulty, based on grade levels.
</P>
<P>
   Another helpful item in this program is a password option. By
setting a password, the user can limit the ability of other
computer users to alter a puzzle. That function lets teachers or
parents set up puzzles on home or classroom computers without
worrying about computer-adept children getting access to the
solutions or layout or changing them.
</P>
<P>
   While the program is not easy to use, the ability to add
graphics and sound (importing them from other programs) to your
puzzle is a wonderful option that could result in some exciting and
attractive puzzles. And it is relatively simple to export the
puzzles from Crossword Studio into other programs, which is helpful
when creating print materials.
</P>
<P>
   This program offers a good selection of ready-made puzzles to
solve. If your mission is to use your own word list or a custom
layout, however, there are better options out there.

CBS LOOKS TO WIDEN ITS AUDIENCE WITH `NOW AND AGAIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ``Now and Again'' doesn't look like a CBS
show. It certainly doesn't feel like one.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it is a good show, real good one-hour drama (9 p.m.
Fridays, starting in the fall), the best one the network is rolling
out this September. But in an era of network ``branding,'' where
sibling shows are supposed to appear, act and sound the same _
think of the kids with the perfect eyes on the WB _ the unique
``Now and Again'' just doesn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worried about that. But I don't think `Moonlighting' was an
ABC show when it premiered,'' said executive producer Glenn Gordon
Caron, who also produced the singular Bruce Willis/Cybill Shepherd
comedy in the 1980s. ``I sort of follow my own muse and hope other
people are amused.''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of what CBS is doing now. The network got more viewers to
watch its shows last year than any other broadcaster _ and lost
money. That's because The Eye is continuing to try to appeal to
people beyond the lucrative targeted demographics, while other
networks are going for a specific audience in a strategy dubbed
``narrowcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, narrowcasting is a dirty word,'' CBS entertainment
president Nancy Tellem said. ``We've been a consistent broadcaster
and hold to that strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season CBS embarked on an effort to go after an audience
that had eluded the network: males and younger people. To a point
CBS succeeded, thanks in great part to the return of the NFL and
shows like ``JAG,'' ``Becker'' and ``Martial Law.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does CBS do for this coming season? It premieres three
female lawyer shows _ ``Family Law,'' ``Judging Amy'' and ``Work
with Me.'' These shows, two dramas and a sitcom, are not exactly
tailored toward young males.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are broadcasters. There are certain shows that appeal to
different people on our network,'' television president Leslie
Moonves said. ``Obviously, the people who will watch `Falcone' (a
Mafia show premiering in mid-season; see below) might not
necessarily be the `Touch By an Angel' fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Moonves continued. ``And I think it is going to
only be to our betterment that the other (networks) are all doing
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' is the story of John Goodman _ except he dies
in the first half. But the insurance salesman's brain and
consciousness are preserved and planted into the perfect
government-built body of Eric Close (``Magnificent Seven'').
</P>
<P>
   There are several side stories, including an extremely spooky
Asian walking around major cities with deadly sarin-filled eggs (in
the opening as the Beatles' ``I Am the Walrus'' plays in the
background). In a word, it's pretty trippy.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly ``Diagnosis Murder,'' is it? More like, what? A Fox
show?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are other networks where it might fit in,'' said
Caron. ``Would it fit in better? I don't know. They (CBS) sense
that it is different and might attract some different eyes for the
network.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes CBS ... a broadcaster. What a new concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone,'' based on the true story of undercover FBI agent Joe
Pistone as portrayed in the mob flick ``Donnie Brasco,'' is a
strong drama that came around at the right time _ and the wrong
time.
</P>
<P>
   With the success of HBO's ``The Sopranos,'' the time was right
for a taut network Mafia drama. Unfortunately, it came to Les
Moonves' desk a week after the Littleton school massacre. Moonves
was in no mood for death on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a visceral response to some of the violence
there,'' Moonves said. ``It was too early at that point to say,
yes, let's go ahead and put this on the fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we knew qualitatively that it was a terrific
show, one of our best pilots and something that had a lot of fans
throughout the company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' did not make the fall slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, I was initially disappointed ... but I
understood it,'' executive producer Mark Johnson said. But now the
drama has been slotted as a mid-season replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at some of the tepid fall CBS shows, and the success of
recent mid-season replacements from ``Becker'' (CBS) to
``Providence'' (NBC) and even ``Dilbert'' (UPN), it may have turned
out best for the show after all.

   CROSSWORD WEAVER
</P>
<P>
   Variety Games
</P>
<P>
   $49.95 with Diskette and Manual, $39.95 downloaded from company
website
</P>
<P>
   Windows 3.1, 95, 98 &AMP; NT
</P>
<P>
   Upon opening Crossword Weaver, any computer user will feel right
at home. The interface features familiar pull-down menu options and
button shortcuts to click on. The left side of the screen is filled
with a blank puzzle grid, and the right side has a tabbed notebook
for easy puzzle creation. There is little need to consult the
manual.
</P>
<P>
   This program is ideal for designing a puzzle quickly.
Construction is easy, but control and customization are not. If you
want a program that will rapidly create a puzzle for you, and using
your own vocabulary and design is not a priority, this is a good
software package to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The program will construct a puzzle using only words you have
entered, or it will mix in words from its own dictionary to create
a tighter puzzle. If you choose to use the hybrid, you can design
your own layout or choose from the program's 50 stock patterns. You
can also choose from several different symmetry tools, which add
balance to the pattern for a professional-looking design. While the
idea of a tight, polished puzzle has obvious appeal, you will have
to turn to the Crossword Weaver's dictionary to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   This program puts more emphasis on layout than word choice. When
I used the Mix Dictionary Words function, the resulting puzzle
included very few of my own words. For example, in one puzzle
attempt, the program was able to create its own loosely constructed
layout and include 29 of my 42 answer words, but when I added the
Mix Dictionary Words function to make a tighter or more interesting
design, only nine of my words were included in the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot choose to use a tightly laid out puzzle or a custom
design without adding dictionary words. I found that to be limiting
because an interesting shape can add to the impact of a puzzle,
particularly for children. Including dictionary words can have
negative consequences, making a puzzle appropriate for a different
age group or for a different educational purpose.
</P>
<P>
   These limitations can get in the way. I attempted to create a
puzzle for a friend's 30th birthday party but was forced to choose
either a computer-assigned pattern or a puzzle with dictionary
words that had no relationship to my birthday theme.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual feature of Crossword Weaver is a database of clues
available for the dictionary words. The program provides clues for
60,000 words. There is also a button to show alternate clues, which
allows the user to choose among several clue options. The program
turns to its clue database both when using the dictionary for word
selection and when entering custom words.
</P>
<P>
   While I was surprised that the program did not include a button
to import word lists from other software programs, like a
vocabulary list, I found it easy to do anyway. I created a list in
my word-processing program, saved it on my hard drive as a
text-only file and then clicked on the Add Words From File button.
</P>
<P>
   While this program has some obvious shortcomings, it can be a
quick and easy solution to crossword creation. I would not
recommend it, however, for creating crosswords that have special
shapes or that need to stick to a specific set of words.
</P>
<P>
   CROSSWORKS
</P>
<P>
   Homeware, $29.50
</P>
<P>
   Windows 3.1, 95, 98, NT
</P>
<P>
   There is a friendly, welcoming look to Crossworks. The program
seems to have been created with competent users in mind. If you
know what you want to accomplish and are comfortable in a Windows
environment, you can just jump in.
</P>
<P>
   What you will find is one of the most comprehensive crossword
programs, catering to the advanced creator's every need. You may
also find a fair measure of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other programs reviewed here, Crossworks does not
compose puzzles for you. You decide on the design, size and number
and placement of black-out squares. You place the words in the
design and fit them together as you would if you were doing this
with paper and pen, and the program provides a list of words that
will fit into a given across or down sequence.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as I was composing a puzzle I had a space that was
nine letters across to fill; the third letter was R and the word
ended with L. I clicked on Search For Words, and the program
provided 28 words from its puzzle dictionary that fit my space. The
words could be used for various topics and themes, providing many
potential solutions.

<P>
   To write your clues with Crossworks, you first go to Wordbase,
your personal database, and enter a word. You then have the option
of looking up the word in the dictionary. The dictionary's list of
synonyms can be used to help write your clue.
</P>
<P>
   After setting your grid layout in the main screen, you can
toggle between the across and down words by right-clicking your
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the program's assistance, I found it frustrating to
create puzzles. For example, when I needed words to fill specific
gaps in a puzzle pattern, I found that such words simply did not
exist in the program's 100,000-word dictionary. I would face the
same problem in building a puzzle independently, of course.
Creating a good crossword puzzle is an art; the software helps by
showing you sooner, rather than later, if the words you need do not
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Crossworks has a section that can be used to help you solve a
puzzle from another source. I found the process simple but only
mildly helpful on a newspaper puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   The steps are easy. First you copy the black-square pattern of
the puzzle onto the grid, then you begin solving the puzzle. The
program has a function that allows you to type in the letters you
know of a word and keywords from the clues. The program uses its
dictionary to provide a list of alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   While I loved the idea of getting a little help, the software
was unable to assist me with most of my attempts to figure out
clues. And solving puzzles on screen was neater but somehow less
satisfying than the pencil-and-eraser method.
</P>
<P>
   CROSSWORD MAGIC
</P>
<P>
   Mindscape
</P>
<P>
   Available only through www.learningcompanyschool.com, $59.95
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 and 98, and Macintosh OS 7.1 to 7.05
</P>
<P>
   I was somewhat surprised that upon opening Mindscape's Crossword
Magic, I was faced with a full blank screen containing only a
background color and a short menu bar along the top edge. There was
no puzzle grid, no eye-catching icon to draw you in. This was not
the impressive start I would have expected from one of the
better-known programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this abrupt start, the program is user friendly, listing
all options in the top pop-up menu and covering all the basics of a
helpful crossword program.
</P>
<P>
   To create a crossword, you can enter your words directly into a
grid, type them in a word menu box, or import them from a
word-processing program. The program will assemble the puzzle and
give you a list of words not yet used. If you wish to put the words
together yourself, simply click on the grid and start typing. The
whole program is intuitively and sensibly designed.
</P>
<P>
   While this program easily allows you to print out colorful
puzzles, playing on the screen provides several helpful options.
The user can show various pieces of information, like the solution
for any one word clue or even the whole puzzle. If the puzzle is
used as a testing tool, that may make cheating too easy, but a
frustrated puzzle solver finds it refreshing to be able to ask for
as much or as little help as needed.
</P>
<P>
   While I was let down by the Crossword Magic interface, its
functionality makes it one of my favorites. There are no fancy
layouts, but it is a fantastic tool for pulling your work together.

`BRAVE NEW WORLD': AWHIRL IN A SHORT-ORDER SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Yes, it is possible to have an intelligent conversation on
television that is enhanced with visual approaches to matters of
the moment. If you doubt it, tune into ``Brave New World,'' the
eight-part ``Nightline'' look at the way the world is changing
around us and how those changes may be affecting human personality.
</P>
<P>
   With assistance from Silicon Valley enthusiasts, musical groups,
dancers, animators and others, ABC's engaging Robert Krulwich
orchestrates discussions on the fascination with speed, the promise
of robots, the appeals of cloning, the threat of extinction, the
nature of quarks, the life of a microbe and other provocative
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's opening program takes up speed in various
manifestations. Why is it, asks Krulwich, that everything seems to
go much faster these days, yet people keep getting less and less
patient? Rooting for speed and more speed is Michael Malone, who
edits Forbes A.S.A.P., a magazine devoted to an ever faster life,
which he maintains is a natural human need.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate gratification is everybody's goal. The telephone user
who not so long ago was content to wait a few seconds for a call to
be answered now loses patience at about the second ring. Malone
observes that ``we are trying to save time so we can live.'' The
trouble is that ``time is the hardest thing in the world to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   In a droll aside on the way speed incorporates itself into daily
life, Krulwich reports on how a short-order cook on Long Island
adapts to preparing 10 different breakfasts simultaneously so
customers can get what they want as soon as they want it, which is
right now. That leads to a discussion of the brain's automatic
response to the call of duty.
</P>
<P>
   As technology works on our expectations of instant satisfaction,
so the argument goes, it also changes us physically, which allows
for even less patience. Krulwich suggests that humans are rushing
around ever faster in order to stave off fears of dying.
</P>
<P>
   How serious he is about that, I cannot say, but such speculation
gives these programs their edge. Now, if only everybody would slow
down a little, we might have even more reflective television.

`MY FATHER, DANCING': FLAWED FATHERS, DAUGHTERS WHO LOVE AND
LEARN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Mr. Sweetly Indecent,'' one of the most accomplished
stories in Bliss Broyard's wonderful first collection, ``My Father,
Dancing,'' the first-person narrator catches sight of her father
kissing a strange woman on the Manhattan street where he rents a
pied-a-terre. The narrator has just left an apartment nearby where
she has spent the night with a man she met through a friend at
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next few days I waited for the phone to ring,'' she
reports. ``Neither man called,'' she continues, subtly reducing her
father to the class of the inconstant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to do anything,'' her father tells her when they
eventually meet for dinner at a restaurant to discuss what she has
seen. ``It doesn't change the way I feel about your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ```But it makes everything such a lie,' I say, my voice now
catching with held-back tears. `What about our family, all the
dinners, Sunday mornings around the breakfast table, the walks we
love to take. ...' ''
</P>
<P>
   ```No. No. All of that is true. This doesn't change any of
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she is deeply troubled, and her parents, noting her
distress, treat her ``like I am sick or have just suffered some
great loss'' when she spends the weekend at their home in the
suburbs. After a tense Sunday dinner, she retreats to the kitchen
and is tempted to smash a platter in anger. Instead she peeks out
at them, still sitting at the table, and is reminded of a scene in
the past when she saw her father kneel before her mother and she
thought he was asking her to marry him again.
</P>
<P>
   But ``this time what I remember is the righteousness of my
mother's posture as she sat across from my father and tossed off
remarks and the guilty urgency of my father's movements as he sank
to his knees at her feet, and how there was something slightly
orchestrated about their behavior, as though their exchange had a
long history to it.''
</P>
<P>
   All the fathers are flawed in these stories, seductive and
overbearing. The daughters love and learn. In the collection's
comic masterpiece, ``The Trouble with Mr. Leopold,'' the resulting
tension breaks into open conflict. Celia attends the posh
Woodbridge Country Day School, where it is a tradition for
volunteering parents to prune the garden every fortnight, until the
topiary has become ``no longer recognizable.'' When Leopold assigns
Celia to write a film review, she turns for help to her father,
himself a reviewer (as was the author's father, Anatole Broyard, a
book critic for The New York Times), who in a burst of impatience
does the work for her.
</P>
<P>
   When the piece he writes gets a C-plus (Leopold having
recognized the author), Celia's father is outraged and over her
protests sets out to get Leopold fired. As her father harangues the
school's headmaster, Celia sits in the garden smoking an illegal
cigarette and reflects on the misshapen shrubbery. ``As I looked
around at the ungainly figures, any hint of their original outlines
lost long ago, I thought how of all the things that I could be sad
about today, this continuance of care made me the saddest, these
valiant, misguided efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the father will always haunt his daughter. In the title
piece, ``My Father, Dancing,'' the narrator, attending her father,
dying of cancer, in a hospital, recalls how he liked to dance with
her. ``As my body grew and pushed out in new places, I wriggled
these parts and tried on different movements, the way I would try
on new clothes,'' she writes. ``He was my first male audience, and
I used him as a mirror to understand what I looked like to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once my father told me he wanted to be the first man to break
my heart,'' she continues, ``because then he could insure that at
least it would be done gently.'' But as she sits by him in the
hospital and waits vainly for some sign from him, ``I realized that
he was breaking my heart and it wasn't gentle at all.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Broyard's writing has any flaw, it is her dialogue, which
tends to be a little stiff and monochromatic. You would think a
sophisticated woman like Victoria in ``At the Bottom of the Lake''
would escape the author's habit of using ``like'' instead of ``as
if'': `` `That's absolutely fascinating, Frank,' said Victoria.
`God, I'd forgotten how miserable that drive is. I feel like I've
been up for days.'''
</P>
<P>
   But it is between the lines that Ms. Broyard's writing is most
effective. Between the lines, her personae confront the sexuality
with which their fathers overwhelm them. In ``Snowed In,'' a group
of boys and girls are stranded together and self-consciously play
sex games. Lily, the protagonist, gets drunk and falls asleep.
Bobby Callahan undresses her, then lowers his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he leaned forward to crouch over her again, he saw that
Lily's eyes were open,'' the text reads. ``Look away, he thought.
Say something. Finally he rocked backward to his heels and yanked
his pants back up, hopped off the bed and walked out of the room.''
</P>
<P>
   The final paragraph of the story repeats the experience from
Lily's point of view. ``She kept waiting. ... Only now it was for
him to touch her again, and when at last she felt his fingertips on
her cheek, down her body, leaving warm traces on each place he
touched, she wasn't sure what she wanted. But when she opened her
eyes, the distance between them was much less than she imagined it
would be _ his face hovered over hers _ and she saw that what was
about to happen wasn't something that could be turned on or off at
whim. And once she saw that, she couldn't look away.''
</P>
<P>
   In these eight arresting stories, Ms. Broyard proves herself a
powerful writer who never looks away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Water entering your house from the municipal water supply comes
in cold. Before it gets to your faucets, some of the water is
diverted to a hot water heater, so that when you open the faucet,
hot water runs out.
</P>
<P>
   A hot water heater is essentially a large, glass-lined steel
tank with a heater under it. A layer of insulation surrounds the
tank, and the entire unit is enclosed in a sheet-metal jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The typical hot water heater is a self-contained appliance that
works automatically. Unless the unit malfunctions, most homeowners
rarely give it a second thought. Most hot water heaters last about
10 years, but this life span can often be extended if the unit is
properly cared for. An annual inspection followed by a little
routine maintenance can often keep your hot water heater
functioning properly.
</P>
<P>
   Start by looking at the control box and thermostat control near
the bottom of the tank. The thermostat control should be set to 140
degrees Fahrenheit. If the control is higher, at 160 degrees or
more, it could put more stress on the tank causing it to burn out
prematurely. Even a 140-degree setting may be too high if you have
small children or elderly members in your family; for safety
reasons, you may want to lower the setting to 130 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Also near the bottom of the tank is a faucet, called a hose bib,
that can be opened to flush the tank. Flushing the tank removes
sediment deposits that block the transmission of heat from the
burner to the tank water. This reduces the efficiency of the burner
so it takes longer produce hot water.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for this, homeowners often raise the thermostat
control. This results in higher energy bills and can shorten the
life of the tank by increasing thermal stresses. Sediment deposits
also contribute to tank corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   To flush the system, first shut off the water supply to the
heater. Then place a bucket under the faucet, or run a hose from
the faucet to a nearby drain. Open the valve and allow the water to
flow out. At first the water may be dark brown and heavy with rust
and muck. Keep the faucet open until the water runs clear.
</P>
<P>
   Older hot water heaters may need to be flushed more often, every
couple of months. Frequent flushings that carry a lot of sediment
are an indication that the lining in the tank has eroded and the
unit is nearing the end of its useful life. Another sign of buildup
is an audible gurgling or rumbling sound caused by air bubbles
rising through the sediment layer to the water above.
</P>
<P>
   Near the top of the hot water heater you should find a pressure
relief valve, possibly fitted with a long downspout. The pressure
relief valve is a safety feature that is found on most, but not
all, hot water heaters. (If your hot water heater doesn't have this
feature, consider having a plumber install one.) It senses when
water pressure inside the tank is rising to unsafe levels. It
automatically opens to relieve the pressure before it can burst the
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Part of your inspection should include a pressure relief-valve
test. Place a bucket under the downspout, then lift the lever on
top of the valve. Release it so it snaps back; the valve should
discharge a burst of water through the downspout. If it doesn't,
the valve is defective and should be replaced by a plumber.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a gas-fired hot water heater, you should inspect the
burner unit and vacuum the burner chamber. Remove the cover to the
burner chamber and look at the burner flame. The flame should burn
with a steady blue color. A yellow flame color is an indication
that the burner needs to be cleaned and readjusted. This is a job
for a heating specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Turn off the unit and allow it to cool before vacuuming around
the burner. Use a crevice wand attachment to vacuum up all rust and
dirt deposits around the burner.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a gas hot water heater you should make a backdraft
test at the hood (also called a vent hat) on the vent duct. The
vent duct delivers combustion gases from the burner to outside the
house. It is important that all the gases be pulled up through the
duct. This is called a positive flow. To check the flow, hold a
smoking incense stick near the vent hood. The smoke from the stick
should be drawn up under the hood into the vent pipe. If the smoke
blows away from the duct, there is a malfunction. This should be
corrected as soon as possible by a heating specialist.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am building in some cabinets and work tables in my home
office and plan to make these units of plywood. I plan to finish
with stain and varnish rather than paint so what can you suggest to
cover up or conceal the raw edges of the plywood?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simplest and most common way to hide plywood edges is to
cover the raw edges with strips of wood veneer that come in tape
form and in various tones or wood species. The ``tape'' is usually
glued on. Another method often used to cover exposed plywood edges
is to glue or nail on solid wood strips or moldings, as shown in
the accompanying drawing. Corner joints can be concealed and the
edges covered by using corner molding that wraps around and
overlaps the corner joint, while single edges can be covered by
gluing on half-round, quarter-round, or cove-type moldings similar
to the ones illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are having a problem with mildew forming on the outside
walls of some rooms in our house. We applied a coat of stain killer
before painting over this mildew, but the mildew stains came back
in less than one year. How can I permanently get rid of this mildew
problem without repainting every year or so?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before painting over a mildewed surface you should first
clean off and kill the mildew by wiping on a solution of one part
liquid laundry bleach mixed with three parts water. Allow this to
dry on the surface for 10 or 15 minutes, then rinse off with lots
of plain water. Repaint with one coat of a shellac-base stain
killer, then finish with one or two coats of a paint that contains
extra mildewcide (some paint stores sell small bottles of extra
mildewcide that you can add to the paint).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our downstairs bathroom frequently has an awful smell _
almost like an open sewer. The fixtures have suitable traps and
these are not clogged. At our plumber's suggestion we had the vent
pipe above the roof extended higher, but the problem still
persists. Do you have any idea what else we can do?
</P>
<P>
   A: One possible caused is a partially clogged vent line. Another
is a missing or improperly installed vent line that is supposed to
connect each fixture to the main vent stack. I would suggest
calling in an experienced plumbing contractor to check out the
entire drain-waste and vent system connected to that bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We moved into our present home a couple of years ago and have
been having a constant problem with dampness in the basement after
every period of heavy rain. We can see no actual leaks, but we can
see a number of damp spots on the walls, especially near the floor.
Can we get rid of this dampness by applying a waterproofing paint
of some kind to the bare concrete?
</P>
<P>
   A: If there are no actual cracks, holes or other defects in the
masonry _ merely a slight seepage that is coming through the
concrete walls from outside _ then it is possible that a waterproof
paint or sealer applied on the inside may help. However, you should
also check around the outside to make certain that the ground
slopes away from the foundation on all sides so that water coming
down from the downspouts is carried away from the basement walls
before it can seep into the ground.
</P>
<P>

   Front-running Republican presidential candidate  &UR; George W. &LR; 
 &UR; Bush &LR;  has hired a Houston Chronicle sports columnist to ghost-write
his autobiography, reports Washingtonian magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The client list of ghost  &UR; Mickey Herskowitz &LR;  includes  &UR; Dan &LR; 
 &UR; Rather &LR; ,  &UR; Mickey Mantle &LR; ,  &UR; John Connally &LR; ,  &UR; Howard Cosell &LR; ,  &UR; Gene &LR; 
 &UR; Tierney &LR; ,  &UR; Bette Davis &LR;  and  &UR; Tom Kite &LR; , says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Before the authorized bio hits bookstore shelves,  &UR; Molly &LR; 
 &UR; Ivins &LR;  has one on the calendar for January. The title: ``Shrub: The
Short But Happy Political Life of George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. When the Washington Post asked Bush recently whether his
youthful escapades had ever included cocaine, he said that he had
``learned from my mistakes'' and that he wouldn't say more. ``This
is a game where they float rumors, force a person to fight off a
rumor. And I'm not going to participate.''

   A collection of Impressionist paintings bought and owned by Dr.
Paul-Ferdinand Gachet is wowing visitors to the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, but  &UR; Vincent Van Gogh &LR; 's first version of his ``Portrait of
Dr. Gachet'' seems to be missing.
</P>
<P>
   The work was bought nine years ago by  &UR; Ryoei Saito &LR; , a Japanese
businessman, for $82 million. When he learned that his heirs would
have to pay an inheritance tax on the work, he threatened to burn
it. Although Saito died three years ago, the painting has not been
seen since. A Met official told the BBC that the portrait ``may no
longer exist.''

   &UR; _ Martin Scorsese &LR; , 56, has announced his marriage, in New York
on July 22, to book editor  &UR; Helen Morris &LR; , 52, whom he met while
they worked on a companion book to ``Kundun.'' Morris is wife No. 5
for Scorsese, and he is her second husband.

   _ Charged.com has proclaimed the Top 10 Hairdos of History, a
list headed by the  &UR; Julius Caesar &LR; , ``the emperor of all
haircuts.'' Meanwhile,  &UR; Leelee Sobieski &LR;  told Details magazine that
she collects locks of hair from celebrities, but  &UR; Kathie Lee &LR; 
 &UR; Gifford &LR;  refused to participate in anything that might result in
hair rearrangement. Instead, she gave her a cast-off hairbrush,
from which a sample could be collected.
</P>
<P>
   _ In an introduction to Psalms in a new Grove/Atlantic Press
paperback edition of the King James Bible,  &UR; Bono &LR;  of U2 calls King
 &UR; David &LR;  ``the  &UR; Elvis &LR;  of the Bible,'' reports New York magazine. The
comparison apparently is based on looks rather than songwriting
ability.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bitterwaitress.com, a Web site that includes testimonials _
and, possibly, wild allegations _ from workers in the food trade,
has tarred both  &UR; Madonna &LR;  and  &UR; Willie Brown &LR;  with the 10
percent-tipper brush. ``It's not true,'' said  &UR; Michel Bonnet &LR; ,
owner of Le Central, where the mayor often eats. ``He's a fair and

 &UR; Finton &LR;  saw a nicely dressed man stooped over a manhole cover,
across which he was dragging _ by means of a red string tied around
the heel _ a woman's shoe in which a weight had been placed. The
researcher told Finton he was doing a study on the ``coefficient of
friction on a manhole cover, in case people slip.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Newspaper editor  &UR; Horace Greeley &LR; 's handwriting was so bad,
says the latest issue of Smithsonian, that no one could read it.
One staff member Greeley had fired via a handwritten note ``was
able to pass the note off as a letter of recommendation and
promptly land himself another job.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Tony Schwartz &LR;  writes in New York magazine about the benefits
and pitfalls of e-mail, ``the quick pick-me-up that's scarily
addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of better and speedier communication,'' he notes,
``e-mail can be rude, clipped, superficial and depressingly
desiccated. A boon when it comes to making lunch dates and
answering yes-or-no questions, it is also an insistent source of
distraction from more demanding work. E-mail has proved fiercely
addictive _ cocaine for compulsive achievers.''

 &HT;    Summertime - and the cooking is easy
 &HT;    By Susan Puckett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frogmore Stew
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time:
20-40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This Lowcountry classic is casual summer eating at its best.
Halve or double the recipe depending on the number of diners;
spread out newspapers on the table and put a bowl in the middle for
tossing the shrimp shells as you peel and eat them. Have some
crusty bread for dunking in the spicy liquid.
</P>
<P>
   4 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons Old Bay seasoning
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   2 celery ribs, cut in 2-inch
</P>
<P>
   pieces (optional)
</P>
<P>
   4 medium or 8 small red-skinned potatoes
</P>
<P>
   4 ears corn, husks and silks removed and ears cut in half
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound chorizo or other spicy smoked sausage, cut in 2-inch
lengths
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds large shrimp, peeled or unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   In an extra-large stockpot over high heat, combine the water,
salt, Old Bay, red pepper flakes and celery. Bring to a boil; cook
for 5 minutes. Skim and discard any foam that rises to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Add potatoes and cook just until fork-tender, 10-20 minutes
depending on size of potatoes. Add corn and sausage; cook 3-5
minutes longer. Add shrimp and cook until pink and opaque. Serve in
shallow bowls with some of the spicy liquid, if desired, for
dunking bread.

</P>
<P>
   Panzanella (Tuscan Bread Salad)
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This easy-to-assemble, rustic salad depends on sturdy
country-style bread that's several days old for its success.
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces stale Italian or country-style bread, crust trimmed if
desired
</P>
<P>
   3 large tomatoes, diced
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 small red onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Greek-style olives, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup torn fresh basil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Cut bread into fist-size hunks and dip each piece _ one at a
time _ in cool water for about 2 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze as much of the water out of the bread as you can and
crumble it into a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The bread can be as fine as couscous or as large as small
croutons. To the crumbled bread add the tomatoes, garlic, red
onion, olives, basil, vinegar and oil. Season to taste with salt
and pepper.

<P>
   Per serving: 266 calories, 6 grams protein, 12 grams fat

   Poached Whole Chicken and
</P>
<P>
   Artichokes With
</P>
<P>
   Chipotle Mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get much easier than this. Everything can be prepared
the night before and kept in the refrigerator. The chicken and
artichokes need little attention once they begin cooking. The
pungent chipotle-spiked mayo is made in the blender in seconds. Any
leftover chicken can be used for chicken salad.
</P>
<P>
   1 2 1/2-to-3-pound whole chicken, giblets removed
</P>
<P>
   1 whole lemon, halved
</P>
<P>
   2 stalks celery, halved
</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium onion
</P>
<P>
   3 whole cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon whole peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   Artichokes:
</P>
<P>
   4 artichokes
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 whole lemon, halved
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Chipotle mayonnaise for dipping (1 cup good-quality mayonnaise
and 1 chipotle pepper canned in adobo sauce, pureed in a blender
until smooth)
</P>
<P>
   In a stockpot, combine the chicken, lemon, celery, onion,
garlic, bay leaves, thyme, salt and peppercorns. Let it come to a
gentle boil, turn the heat down so that the water barely moves and
poach for 1 hour or until chicken is done.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rinse artichokes, pierce the bottoms with a fork and
place them in a deep pan. Cover with water and add salt, lemon, and
olive oil. Gently boil the artichokes over medium-high heat for
about 40 minutes or until they're tender.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with poached chicken and use chipotle mayonnaise as a
dipping sauce for the artichokes.
</P>

   Black-Eyed Pea and Smoked Ham Salad With Roasted Red
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Dressing
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   With convenience items such as canned black-eyed peas and
bottled roasted red peppers, this recipe is a snap. Try it with
country ham for extra flavor.
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup bottled roasted red peppers, drained (about 6 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 15-ounce cans black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound smoked ham, sliced 1/4 inch thick and then diced
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch arugula or mixed field greens, stemmed, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   Place the oil, vinegar, peppers and garlic in the work bowl of a
food processor. Process until smooth. Scrape the dressing into a
small bowl and stir in the salt. Combine the peas, ham and arugula
in a large bowl. Toss with the dressing to coat. Serve immediately.

   Asparagus Frittata With Prosciutto
</P>
<P>
   and Mint

   The beauty of frittatas is that you can add almost anything to
them. This combination of asparagus, prosciutto and mint is light
and refreshing. For one serving, simply cut the recipe in half and
reduce cooking time to about 12 minutes stovetop and less than 1
minute under the broiler (or until desired amount of brownness.)
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   6 thick asparagus spears, trimmed of tough ends and sliced
diagonally in 1/4-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   Salt and ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce, or 2 to 4 thin slices, of prosciutto, minced
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons chopped fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   Pepper
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in an ovenproof 8-inch nonstick frying pan or
skillet over medium heat. Add the asparagus, season with salt and
pepper and saute until just tender, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat if
necessary to prevent browning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together the eggs, prosciutto, mint
and several grinds of pepper. When the asparagus pieces are just
tender, add the egg mixture to the frying pan and immediately
reduce heat to low. Stir gently to distribute the asparagus evenly,
then stop stirring and let the frittata set slowly over low heat,
about 15 minutes. It will still be runny on the top. Slip the
frying pan under the broiler and broil briefly to set the top.
Check after 1 minute. If not brown enough, broil another 30
seconds. Remove from broiler and invert a serving dish over the
frying pan. Carefully invert the plate and pan together and lift
off the pan. Let cool briefly; it's better served warm than hot.

   Chicken Breasts With

   Artichokes and Garlic
</P>
<P>

   Cooking in parchment is a wonderful way to seal in juices,
especially in the microwave. Plus, it makes cleanup a breeze. Here,
whole garlic cloves become soft and considerably milder as they
cook with the chicken. Squeeze the cloves out of their skins and
spread them on French bread.
</P>
<P>
   2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
</P>
<P>
   1 (6-ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts
</P>
<P>
   12 garlic cloves, unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon rosemary
</P>
<P>
   Optional seasonings: salt, pepper and paprika to taste
</P>
<P>
   Tear off two 10-by-14-inch pieces of parchment (see note). Fold
in half and trim edges to form a half-moon shape. Place chicken
breast half to one side of crease on each piece of parchment.
Arrange half the artichokes (reserve marinade) and garlic around
each piece of chicken. Sprinkle with rosemary and other seasonings;
drizzle with marinade from artichokes.
</P>
<P>
   Fold over parchment edges to close and crimp to seal. Place on a
plate. Microwave on high 5-6 minutes, just until the chicken is
white throughout but still juicy. Let stand 2 to 3 minutes. Serve
in the parchment on a dinner plate. _ Adapted from ``365 Quick and
Easy Microwave Recipes'' by Thelma Pressman (Harper and Row)
</P>
<P>
   Note: Parchment is available in cookware shops and some
supermarkets. If you prefer, the chicken can be baked in individual
airtight foil pouches in a 350-degree oven for 30 to 40 minutes.
For guests, double or triple the recipe and set them all on a
cookie sheet. (Parchment may be used in the oven, but foil should
not be used in the microwave.)

</P>
<P>
   1 medium head lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces (about 10
cups)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (4 ounces)
</P>

<P>
   1 avocado, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Prepare Tortilla shells (see below). Cook ground beef in 10-inch

chili powder, cumin, salt, garlic powder, red pepper and kidney
beans. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer uncovered 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally; cool 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mix lettuce, cheese, olives, tomatoes and onion in large bowl.
Toss with Thousand Island Dressing. Pour ground beef mixture over

<P>
   Tortilla shells: Remove label and both ends of reserved kidney
bean can. Wash and dry can. Heat oil (1 1/2 inches) in 3-quart
saucepan to 375 degrees. (Diameter of saucepan should be at least 9
inches.) Place one 10-inch flour tortilla on top of saucepan. Place

into oil by gently pushing can down. Fry tortilla about 5 seconds
or until set; remove can with tongs. Fry tortilla 1 to 2 minutes
longer, turning tortilla in oil, until tortilla is crisp and golden
brown. Carefully remove tortilla from oil and drain excess oil from
inside. Turn tortilla shell upside down; cool. Repeat with
remaining tortillas.

   Boiled potatoes provide the start to this delicious Greek salad.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Pappas' Famous Greek Salad
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 generous servings Preparation time: about 30 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes for potatoes
</P>
<P>
   This authentic Greek salad sent in last summer by Sally Darcey
of Stone Mountain sounds like a perfect summer meal, but its long
list of ingredients may seem like too much kitchen duty. Thankfully
it's easily simplified: Start with a prepared potato salad, or make
a simple one with canned or microwaved potatoes bound with
mayonnaise, wine vinegar and olive oil. Then pile on as many or as
few toppings as you like: shredded lettuce, tomato wedges, cucumber
cubes, bell pepper rings, avocado slices, feta cheese crumbles,
ripe olives, green onions and shrimp. Drizzle on equal parts of oil
and vinegar and shake on dried oregano.
</P>
<P>
   For the potato salad:
</P>
<P>
   6 boiling potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 medium-size onions or 4 green onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup thinly sliced green peppers
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   To assemble:
</P>
<P>
   1 large head lettuce
</P>
<P>
   3 cups potato salad
</P>
<P>
   12 roka leaves (Greek vegetable) or 12 sprigs watercress
</P>
<P>
   2 tomatoes, each cut in 6 wedges
</P>
<P>
   1 cucumber, peeled and cut lengthwise in 8 fingers
</P>
<P>
   1 avocado, peeled and cut in wedges
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces feta (Greek cheese)
</P>
<P>
   1 green bell pepper, cut in 8 rings
</P>
<P>
   4 slices canned cooked beets
</P>
<P>
   4 peeled and cooked shrimp
</P>
<P>
   4 anchovy filets
</P>
<P>
   12 kalamata olives
</P>
<P>
   12 medium-hot Salonika peppers (bought in bottles)
</P>
<P>
   4 fancy cut radishes
</P>
<P>
   4 whole green onions
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup each of olive and salad oil, blended
</P>
<P>
   Oregano
</P>
<P>
   For the potato salad: Boil potatoes in jackets for 30 minutes or
until tender but not soft. Drain, cool and peel potatoes, and when
cold, slice into bowl. Add onions, parsley and peppers. Fold in
mayonnaise and season to taste with salt.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Line large platter with outside lettuce leaves and
place 3 cups of potato salad in a mound in center of platter. Shred
remaining lettuce and place on top. Arrange roka leaves or
watercress on top of lettuce. Place tomato wedges around outer edge
of salad with a few on top, and place cucumber wedges between
tomatoes, making a solid base. Place avocado slices around the
outside. Arrange feta cheese on top, with green pepper slices over
all. On the very top, place sliced beets with a shrimp on each beet
slice and an anchovy filet on the shrimp. Arrange olives, peppers,
radishes and green onions as desired. Sprinkle with the vinegar
(more may be used), then with oil. Sprinkle oregano over all; serve
at once.

   This quick but sophisticated dish from Gourmet magazine cooks in
the microwave in less than 8 minutes. It also works well with
spinach in place of the peas: Just put 6 ounces fresh spinach
leaves in the bottom of the pie pan, sprinkle lightly with water,
top with salmon and proceed. For the sauce, substitute red wine
vinegar for the lemon juice, omit the mint and add a bit of freshly
minced garlic. Save any leftovers. This is outstanding chilled,
too.
</P>
<P>
   For the sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons coarse-grained mustard, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons shredded fresh mint leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried
mint, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   For the salmon:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup frozen peas
</P>
<P>
   2 salmon steaks (each about 8 ounces, 1 inch thick)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Make the sauce: In a bowl whisk together mayonnaise, lemon
juice, mustard, mint and 1 tablespoon water and let the sauce stand
at room temperature for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, spread peas evenly in a 9-to-10-inch glass pie plate
and top with salmon steaks. Season salmon steaks with salt and
pepper, cover the plate tightly with microwave-safe plastic wrap,
leaving a 1-inch opening along the edge, and microwave the mixture
at high power (100 percent), turning the plate 180 degrees after 3
minutes, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the salmon turns opaque and
milky and just flakes when tested with a fork. Remove the plate
from the oven and let the salmon mixture stand, covered loosely,
for 3 minutes. Divide the salmon steaks and the peas between 2
plates and serve the dish warm or at room temperature with the
sauce spooned over it.

   When we drag in from the steam bath outside, the last thing we
crave is a slow-simmered stew or hot-from-the-oven roast. We wither
at the thought of rich, cheesey casseroles or cream-laden sauces.
And at this stage of summer, we're no longer thrilled to spend
every muggy evening sweating over a hot grill. So what does whet
our appetite? Light, bright, unadulterated flavors. Casual,
uncomplicated preparations. Cool or room-temperature fare.
Fortunately, nature makes that easier for us, for at no other time
are the produce bins and seafood cases more plentiful with fresh
fixings that need no gilding and little, if any, cooking.
Supplement these seasonal riches with a few high-quality, everyday
pantry staples and a little creativity, and you can eat well every
day.

   &QR;  Frittata: Eggs can hit the spot breakfast, lunch or dinner,
especially in the form of a frittata _ an Italian version of an
omelet, but flat. No scrambling, no flipping. And you can mix
almost anything in. This time of year, try asparagus and mint.

   &QR;  Black-eye pea salad: Take a can of peas, doctor it up with
cooked ham, bottled roasted peppers and a few other pantry staples,

perhaps served over a few lettuce leaves and paired with a corn
muffin.
</P>

<P>
   &QR;  Greek salad supreme: You could toss some torn romaine lettuce
leaves with crumbled feta, tomato wedges, diced cucumbers, black
olives and oregano-spiked vinaigrette and end there. Or you could
turn it into a company-worthy masterpiece by fortifying it with
potato salad, shrimp, avocado slices and other embellishments.

   &QR;  Turkey pesto hoagies: Mix 1/3 cup of homemade or commercial
pesto with a 1/4 cup mayonnaise. Spread it on some hoagie or sub
rolls and then pile on the sliced turkey, mozzarella, bell pepper
rings and some alfalfa sprouts for a quick and tasty sandwich.

   &QR;  Turkish breakfast buffet. This light but fortifying meal works
any time of day. Start with a cut-up loaf of French bread with
butter and jam. Add some hard-boiled eggs, cut watermelon and other
fresh fruit, sliced cucumbers and tomatoes, oil-cured black olives
and slivers of feta cheese. It all tastes as good with a cappuccino
as a glass of very dry white wine.

<P>
   &QR;  Tortilla club wrap. Try the vibrantly colored, flavored

tomato slices, wrap and eat.

   &QR;  No-work smoked pork chop dinner. It takes but a minute or two
to heat them on a grill or griddle. Garnish with a spoonful of
salsa, chutney or hot pepper jelly. Side dishes of couscous (cooked

snaps require no more work or time.

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Garlicky green beans. If you're having sandwiches for dinner
but want something a little more substantial than chips and carrot
sticks on the side, try this: String snap or pole beans and break
them into bite-size lengths. Boil in salted water until
crisp-tender, drain and rinse them in cold water. In a bowl, toss
them with a drizzle of olive oil, a squeeze of fresh lemon and a
grated or pressed garlic clove. Season with salt, toss well, and
serve. Great at room temperature.

   &QR;  Tuscan bread salad. Don't pitch that slightly over-the-hill
baguette! It can be the basis for panzanella, that refreshing
Mediterranean summer salad that also uses on dead-ripe
tomatoes,oil, vinegar and a few other seasonings.

mayo is made in the blender in seconds.

   &QR;  Taco salads. A cool way to get your Tex-Mex fix is to cook up
some chili-seasoned ground beef or turkey, mix in some beans (you
can do this in the microwave) and serve it cool _ in a tortilla
shell with other taco fixings and topped with Thousand island
dressing.

   &QR;  Pasta with no-cook tomato sauce: A light and aromatic switch
from bottled sauce. In a shallow bowl, mix together 2 pounds of
diced Roma tomatoes, 1 cup chopped fresh basil leaves, 4 crushed
cloves of garlic, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, a splash of
balsamic vinegar, pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, salt and
pepper to taste. Let steep at room temperature at least 1 hour
before tossing sauce with a pound of hot spaghetti or angel hair
pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Aug. 17
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Peanut noodles: Toss spaghetti noodles or Japanese soba
(buckwheat) noodles with bottled or homemade peanut sauce, grated
carrots and half-moon shaped cucumber slices. Garnish with sliced
scallions and chopped peanuts. Serve as a main dish or alongside
cold barbecued chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Aug. 18
</P>
<P>
   Thai larb: Sounds exotic, but this standby at many Thai
restaurants is really easy to make: Cooked ground chichen or pork
is seasoned with ginger, line juice, fish sauce and a few other
seasoning. Diners then scoop up the mixture with ice-cold cabbage
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Aug. 19
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Frogmore stew:
</P>
<P>
   This Lowcountry combo of sausage, shrimp, corn and new potatoes
is little more than tossing ingredients in a pot and cooks in a
flash _ great for a family meal or casual company get-together.
Make extra shrimp so you can eat them cold the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Aug. 20
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tuna and white bean salad. Dump cans of drained tuna and white
kidney beans (or cannellini) in a bowl. Add a few spoonfuls of
minced red onion, a drizzle of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice
and salt and pepper to taste. Serve over lettuce or as is.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Aug. 21
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cold Lithuanian beet soup. This invigorating soup can convert
the most steadfast beet-hater: Shred or dice 3 medium-size cooked
beets (or substitute canned). Combine in a large bowl with 2 cups
buttermilk, 1/2 cup water, 5 thinly sliced green onions, 1 peeled,
seeded and diced cucumber, 1/3 cup chopped fresh dill and salt and
pepper to taste. Chill. Serve with pumpernickel bread. Makes about
a quart.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Aug. 22
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hummus-stuffed pitas. You can buy the ready-made
chickpea-tahini spread in most any supermarket deli section
(usually with the imported cheeses) these days. Tuck it into pita
halves with a few tomato slices, cucumber rounds or a handful of
sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Aug. 23
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Asian-flavored rice salad: Use leftover rice as you would
pasta for any number of cool combos like this one: Mix cooked rice
with sliced scallions, shredded carrots, fresh bean sprouts, sliced
water chestnuts or julienned jicama, chopped celery and chopped
cilantro, if desired. For a heartier salad, add bits of cooked
chicken, shrimp or crabmeat. Toss with and a bottled lemon-grass
vinaigrette or a cilantro-lime dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Aug. 24
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Steamed mussels. Here's the simplest method: Place a pound of
scrubbed, debearded mussels in a large pot with a tight-fitting
lid. Put about an inch or two of water or white wine in a pot,
cover and cook over high heat until mussels open, about 3 to 5
minutes. Serve with crusty bread and Caesar salad from a bag.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Aug. 25
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Steak salad. Grill or pan-fry a filet mignon. Meanwhile, place
some salad greens in a large bowl. Add chopped tomatoes and a
handful of crumbled blue cheese. Slice the steak and add it to the
salad, drizzle with a mustardy vinaigrette and toss. Add a few
grindings of black pepper. (Leftover sliced potatoes are an
excellent addition.)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Aug. 26
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cottage cheese sandwich. Spread raisin, seven-grain, oatmeal
or other hearty bread with lowfat cottage cheese. Add grated
carrots, slivered bell pepper, chopped green onions and a sprinkle
of ground cumin.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Aug. 27
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Summer squash skillet: A quick saute of these garden staples _
along with chopped tomatoes, sliced onions, garlic and herbs _ can
move from side dish to centerpiece if you toss on a generous
handful of grated Parmesan before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Aug. 28
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Grilled grouper sandwich: A lighter alternative to burgers:
Brush grouper steaks with a little oil, season with salt and pepper
and grill (or broil) about 4-5 minutes per side, or until fish
flakes easily when pierced with a fork. Serve on sesame seed buns
with lettuce and tomato slices and tartar sauce. Accompany with
pickled okra spears.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Aug. 29
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pork and butter bean stirfry. Use fresh butter beans from the
garden or frozen ones. In a large skillet, saute in a tablespoon of
vegetable oil 1 small sliced onion and 1 minced garlic clove until
soft. Stir in 3 or 4 cups of cooked butter beans and a cup of diced
cooked pork or ham. Heat through, remove from the stove and
sprinkled with copped mint or basil.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Aug.30
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Black bean and corn salad in tortillas. In a bowl, combine
equal parts canned black beans (drained and minced) and corn
kernels (fresh shucked or frozen, thawed) along with a generous
dollop of good-quality salsa, a sprinkle of olive oil and vinegar
and a few dashes of cumin. Place generous mounds on lettuce-lined
corn or flour tortillas, top with a spoonful of yogurt and roll up.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Aug. 31
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Salmon and peas (or spinach)
</P>
<P>
   Microwave them together in a pie plate, drizzle with a
vinaigrette or flavored mayo and accompany with corn on the cob _
either microwaved or boiled. Presto! You've got a sophisticated
dinner for two _ plus a cool and clean kitchen.

 &HT;    Holding out for cake with seven flavors
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lynn Sullivan is counting on us _ so, no, five flavors
just won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Six, either. It had to be seven for Sullivan, who said if we
came up with the recipe for Seven-Flavor Poundcake, there was
someone in her office willing to bake it and bring it in for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of readers sent in the Five-Flavor Cake as published
here many years ago. Margaret Holland offered a hand-written copy
of Six-Flavor Poundcake, hoping ``maybe that will suffice.''
</P>
<P>
   But we held out for seven _ this one sent in by Shelia Skinner
of Decatur (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Now we hope Sullivan can count on that co-worker's offer.

 &HT;    Kronenbourg a gift from France
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The cheeses from France are fat and creamy, and
everyone knows their natural complement is wine. Cut a wedge of
Camembert or brie and you want to see beside it a bottle of
bordeaux, the first glass already poured and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   What always surprises people is that the French are brewers as
well as winemakers.
</P>
<P>
   A French beer?
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like an oxymoron. Yet the world's most devoted
gastronomes, as Michael Jackson tells us, call a favorite dining
place a ``brasserie,'' a word that means brewery, and the first
brasseries were brewpubs. At such places as Brasserie Lipp in
Paris, for example, beer is served as the house drink, and tables
are hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the French brewing industry is in Alsace, where
German was once the predominant language. The two countries have
fought over the region for centuries, and the cuisine reflects the
two-sided _ part French, part German _ history. Geography and soil
conditions played their part, but it's hardly an accident that
German winemaking has flourished not many kilometers distant.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are familiar with rieslings and other German wines,
entirely different from white French wines. But few know much about
French beer, even though Kronenbourg has been available in
well-stocked package stores for years. Brewed loosely in the style
of south German lagers, Kronenbourg is light but with a slight
sweetness you seldom find in German beers. The sweetness, similar
to what you'll find in an American lager such as Rolling Rock,
usually comes from the addition of corn to the grist _ an addition
the Germans would never allow.
</P>
<P>
   Because they're more or less conventional, they don't have the
versatility with food that some French beers do. These are beers to
enjoy with milder sausages, but not pate and goose dishes.
</P>
<P>
   But Kronenbourg, in addition to its house brand, also makes a
more distinctive beer called 1664, a pilsner with a touch of
dryness and a fresh, floral aroma from Saaz hops. Alongside a
platter of Port Salut and salad of greens with white beans
recently, it had just the right balance of body and hop for a meal
that was neither light nor heavy. Port Salut is a creamy cheese,
even if it is not a Camembert, and a beer without enough malt
backbone would have come off thin and watery. At the same time, a
hoppier beer _ not that I would have objected _ might well have
complemented the cheese but might also have overwhelmed the rest of
the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Kronenbourg 1664 is available in many metro package stores for
about $7 a six-pack, higher than many imports but also better than
most.
</P>
<P>
   The best French beers, unfortunately, stay home. These are
farmhouse beers brewed in Flanders, in the northwest. Because
Belgium is next door, they are greatly influenced by the
individualistic, top-fermented Belgian style. Yet they are French,
and many are served in corked champagne bottles, meant to be
cellared for a year or more before being drunk.
</P>
<P>
   One such beer, sporadically available locally, is Trois Mont, or
3 Mont, named for three hills near the brewery of St. Sylvestre in
a low-lying hop-growing region. Pale gold in color with a complex
malt character and an assertive but not aggressive hop presence, 3
Mont resembles some of the Belgian ales. But the resemblance is
only superficial. You couldn't say it's peculiarly French, but only
that it's a beer you'll find in France and nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The French call them bieres de garde _ beers to be laid down _
and they drink them with mutton, with mussels, with strong local
cheeses, much as the Belgians do.
</P>
<P>
   ``These beers,'' Jackson writes, ``represent a distinct regional
style. It may be a minor one, but it is worthy of attention, and it
embraces some delicious beers.''
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   (RED SEAL ALE)
</P>
<P>
   Ask Mark Ruedrich how he came up with Red Seal Ale and he'll
tell you of a brewing festival he went to in Portland, Ore., in the
1980s. ``There was a guy from Hop Union (a growers' cooperative)
giving a presentation there,'' Ruedrich says. ``I walked into the
room and smelled this incredible hop aroma. I had to find out what
that hop was. I wanted to brew a beer using that hop.''
</P>
<P>
   What he found was a blend that botanists call only CFJ90, and
Ruedrich won't go beyond the botanical shorthand. ``It's our
secret,'' he says. ``I can tell you it's a blend of a couple of
hops, and it has an American profile.''
</P>
<P>
   That would mean it's more pronounced than classic European hops
such as Hallertau, Tettnang and Saaz, mainstays in the best German
and Czech lagers, or the East Kent Golding and Fuggles hops used in
British ales. Red Seal has a slight spiciness that makes you think
of Mount Hood hops and a subtle citrus character, but not like an
ale showcasing Cascade or Columbus hops.
</P>
<P>
   The real secret is how well the hops and the malts balance one
another. ``It has a soft character for such a hoppy beer (47
International Bitterness Units),'' Ruedrich says. ``Red Seal is
really a wonderful example _ if I may say so _ of how well malt and
hops can come together in a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for that soft character is the house yeast,
which lets the hops and malts play their parts without getting too
much in the way. And yet, drinking it, you know this is very much
an ale _ and one of the most interesting ales to enter the metro
area this year.

 &HT;    Mini video reviews
 &HT;    By Steve Murray, Phil Kloer and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Payback'' (R) _ It plays like it looks: cheap, tired,
bleached out. This is a remake of John Boorman's much better 1967
movie ``Point Blank''; the new version never justifies the revisit.
Going the anti-hero route, Mel Gibson plays Porter, a career thief
who heists $140,000 and then gets double-crossed by his cohorts and
is left for dead. Ah, but he isn't. And he returns with a
vengeance. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland, whose uneven record
includes both ``L.A. Confidential'' and ``The Postman,'' doesn't
seem to know what his movie is. It starts off grim but has flashes
of humor and turns almost farcical in climactic shootouts and
explosions. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Noah's Ark'' (unrated) _ Just say Noah. As in ``Noah's
Ark,'' NBC's spectacularly hyped, spectacularly awful miniseries. A
disclaimer at the beginning states: ``For dramatic effect, we have
taken poetic license with some of the events of the mighty epic of
Noah and the flood.'' This would explain the pirates attacking the
Ark. God is not in the details here. In fact, God's a stand-up
comic. Trying to decide whether to spare Noah and his family from
the flood, the voice of God muses, ``I would like a second opinion,
but who could I ask?'' Grade: D-
</P>
<P>
   _Phil Kloer
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Baby Geniuses'' (PG) _ Two-year-olds are cute, their
laughter often glorious to hear, their inquisitive looks precious.
``Baby Geniuses'' has all that _ and, sadly, a whole lot more. Like
a complicated plot with no payoff. And a potty-mouthed script.
Kathleen Turner and Peter MacNichol play rival researchers rushing
to crack the baby-talk code emanating from brilliant babes. First
it's just dumb, then it gets dumber. Grade: D+

   The irresistible ``October Sky'' is a movie that takes its idea
of uplift literally.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Homer H. Hickman Jr.'s autobiography, ``Rocket Boys,''
the drama centers on four teenagers in tiny 1957 Coalwood, W.Va.,
obsessed with building and launching model missiles ... preferably
without killing any bystanders or setting the mountains on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has plenty of explosions. But its core excitement
comes from watching these self-proclaimed ``hillbillies'' discover
their own worth _ and build futures they never dreamed of _ by
using their brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' makes old-fashioned learning seem sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Better known for action films, director Joe Johnston (``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids,'' ``Jumanji'') delivers a movie rich in texture
and place (Tennessee subs here for West Virginia). It can remind
you, favorably, of Michael Apted's ``Coal Miner's Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   As Homer, Jake Gyllenhaal makes a soulful young hero, and he's
well-matched by the smoldering Chris Cooper, who plays his dad,
John.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is as corny as they come. It's also deeply satisfying.
And just try not to cheer when, after many goof-ups, the boys shoot
off a rocket that pierces the clouds. Grade: A-

 &HT;    Classic Van Zandt tunes a haunting, riveting tribute
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Servicex
<TEXT>
<P>
   During his edgy life, Townes Van Zandt was anything but
predictable, so it's no surprise that his most provocative work
would show up two years after his death. From its irony-laced title
to lyrics about ``squashed'' armadillos, this CD is like a last
laugh _ or perhaps a toast _ from the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Hardcore fans will debate how much of the sound here is actually
Van Zandt. Certainly the vocals are authentic; they were hummed
into a home studio microphone in the early '90s. Van Zandt gave
them to his wife, Jeanene, saying, ``You'll need these someday.''
After her husband's death by excess, Jeanene took the digital
audiotapes to producer Eric Paul, who used session players to flesh
out the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   What we are left with is classic Van Zandt (11 tunes have
appeared earlier), interpreted by some of the most creative
musicians to ever back him in the studio. In their hands, Van
Zandt's rambling is infused with energy that has often been missing
in his work. Perhaps the best track is a creepy cut called
``Sanitarium Blues,'' a breathy soliloquy about tuberculosis and
Thorazine that is absolutely riveting. It's one of two tunes here
that have never been heard before. From the ``Ghost Riders in the
Sky'' twanging guitar to the scorching, Slash-style solo lifted
from Guns N' Roses, the sound fits Van Zandt like shrink-wrap.
</P>

<P>
   Too Short. Jive/Short Records.
</P>
<P>
   17 tracks. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Longtime rapper Too Short comes out of retirement towing his
signature use of the ``b'' word and other offenses closely behind
him. Musically this crisp, thinly layered effort sets an example in
this sample-heavy genre of how a live wah-wah guitar (``You Might
Get G'eed'') or bass (``Here We Go'') can be just as effective as
part of a Roger or Isley Brothers record. But when it comes to
writing, the Atlantan's flatly delivered words of wisdom (``Good
Life'') are outweighed by line after line of flagrancy. So for a
guy taking a ride to escape the reality of his boring sex life,
this redundant 11th album should serve as a fine soundtrack. If
it's variety he's looking for, this one won't travel well.

</P>
<P>
   ``No Time Like the Future'' will really have fans wishing for
Incognito past. Which is strange, because at first it seems like
that's what this accomplished acid jazz band is offering. Standout
vocalist Maysa Leake is back after a failed solo attempt. And for
added firepower, house music's top singer Jocelyn Brown joins in.
All of which is wasted talent when paired with hooks such as
``Wherever your river will flow/You know love will follow'' (``Wild
and Peaceful'') and supposedly serious attempts at political
awareness called, comically, ``Get Into My Groove.'' Given the
choice between its earlier instrumental-heavy albums, and this
beautifully produced lyrical disappointment, the choice is as
simple as many of these songs.

   Given the status of Willie Nelson's voice as a national

what Willie's really doing on this woolly-yet-charm-
</P>
<P>
   ing disc is giving everyone a glimpse of his back pages. Backed
by members of the Family, his longtime touring ensemble, he pays
homage to one of his great inspirations _ gypsy guitarist Django
Reinhardt _ with a batch of standards he's probably been humming
for ages. Though ``Night and Day'' lacks the polish of its classic
predecessor, ``Stardust,'' its home-grown versions of ``All the
Things You Are'' and ``Nuages,'' among others, reconcile le jazz
hot and Texas twang with soulful affection.

 &HT;    A more commercial Panic
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the jam-rock bands jamming away out there, Athens/
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta sextet Widespread Panic just may be the jammiest. That's
a blessing and a curse: The band's purist devotion to free-form
improvisation and elongated solos _ often at the expense of
conventional pop structure _ may please the hippie faithful but
hasn't won many admirers outside its cult fan base.
</P>
<P>
   So it's meant as a compliment when I say that, on its seventh
album, Widespread Panic sullies its sound with pop sensibilities.
``Til the Medicine Takes'' is by far the group's most palatable
album for the non-fan. Adorned with such spangly accessories as
gospel choruses and brass ensembles, Panic's usually lumbering
groove sounds surprisingly fleet-footed this time out. Especially
nimble are John ``Jojo'' Hermann's organ parts, which course
through many tunes, including ``Surprise Valley'' and ``Blue
Indian,'' with quicksilver effortlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is no Top 40 sellout. We're hardly three minutes
into the album when we're ``treated'' to a series of guitar, bass
and drum solos that stretch ``Surprise Valley'' to the limits of
endurance. And the lyrics are the usual melange of fuzzy non
sequiturs. What message are the lost souls preached to in ``Climb
to Safety'' supposed to discern from the lines ``You're runnng like
a rabbit/Stick your finger in the dike''?
</P>
<P>
   But on such tightly structured numbers as ``Bear's Gone
Fishin''' and ``You'll Be Fine,'' this heretofore shunned-by-radio
outfit sounds more than ready to conquer the airwaves. Dave
Matthews, watch out.

BLUEBERRIES AND RASPBERRIES MAKE A NICE COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Blueberries and raspberries seem to be like the
best married couples. They have a few things in common and just
enough differences to keep things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   They come from different backgrounds, have distinctly different
flavors and grow on different types of plants. Yet, they ripen
about the same time of year, they both have ``berry'' in the name
and they are both highly nutritious.
</P>
<P>
   Blueberries and raspberries seem to work together like a couple,
too, playing off each other's strengths, filling in each other's
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   While blueberries are sweetly tame and mild flavored,
raspberries are sweetly tart and intensely flavored.
</P>
<P>
   While raspberries have an abundance of small, hard seeds (one in
each druplet, as those little pockets around the core are called),
blueberry seeds are so small they appear nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   And while raspberries are delicate and extremely fragile,
bursting the moment they come under pressure, blueberries have
tough protective skins that can withstand a couple days of
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   These are good facts to know if you're deciding which berry to
buy since they are sometimes interchangeable in recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other things you should know from the Epicurious
Food Dictionary, Dole 5-A-Day for Better Health program, The Oregon
Raspberry and Blackberry Commission and the North American
Blueberry Council.
</P>
<P>
   Raspberries:
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the raspberries produced in American are
grown in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid berries that are moldy, shriveled or soft. Also, look for
berries with the hulls (leafy tops) detached. If the hulls are
still on the berry, it was probably picked too early and will not
be ripe.
</P>
<P>
   Since raspberries are fragile, look for them packaged in a
single layer in plastic containers. If the berries are piled on top
of each other, the weight of the berries on top can be enough to
smash the berries on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Purchase raspberries no more than two days before using, as they
will not keep much longer. Store in the refrigerator. Do not wash
fresh raspberries until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   Raspberries contain a fair amount of iron, potassium and vitamin
A but they are also one of the best sources of fiber. A cup of
fresh raspberries contains 32 percent of the daily value of fiber a
person on a 2,000-calorie diet needs daily. That same cup also
contains 40 percent of the vitamin C needed daily.
</P>
<P>
   Blueberries:
</P>
<P>
   Blueberries, which grow on shrubs native to the Northeast,
aren't bothered by harsh winters. This year's crop is available now
at area farm stands but it is starting to wane.
</P>
<P>
   Choose berries that are firm and indigo blue with a silvery
frost.
</P>
<P>
   Do not wash until ready to use and store in a moisture-proof
container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve blueberries, stem them, rinse in a colander and
freeze in airtight containers or bags. Since many recipes call for
2 cups of berries, we find measuring and freezing 2-cup portions is
convenient.
</P>
<P>
   One cup of fresh blueberries contains 82 calories, a trace of
fat, no cholesterol and 16 percent of the fiber required daily.
</P>
<P>
   Raspberries and blueberries can be used individually or together
in recipes and even substituted for each other. Keep frozen berries
on hand to top ice cream, waffles, add to yogurt, toss on cereal,
blend with yogurt and milk for fruit smoothies and to add to
salads.
</P>
<P>
   Thawed frozen berries can also be pureed, strained and blended
with honey or lemon juice to make a fruit sauce for desserts.

 &HT;    CLINTON LAWYER CALLS LAWSUIT 'PARTISAN RANT'
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, through his lawyer, has assailed
as ``partisan rant'' a filing in Federal District Court here that
asserts several women may have been intimidated in an attempt to
cover up various Clinton scandals.
</P>
<P>
   The president's private attorney, David E. Kendall, responding
to a request by a private ethics watchdog group to question nine
women about an alleged pattern of threats by Clinton and his
associates, told the court that the ``real purpose'' of the motion
``was to make scandalous allegations against the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The reply, filed earlier this month, is part of a lawsuit that
Judicial Watch brought on behalf of Dolly Kyle Browning, a former
friend of Clinton. Now a real estate attorney in Dallas, she
charges the president and three of his associates conspired to
threaten and intimidate her to keep her from revealing the facts
about a relationship she alleged she had with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the case, Judicial Watch is attempting to prove a
pattern of intimidation aimed at eight other women, including
Gennifer Flowers and Kathleen Willey, to discourage them from
testifying truthfully in previous cases.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list of potential witnesses is Juanita Broaddrick,
an Arkansas nursing home executive who said in a televised
interview earlier this year that Clinton had raped her 21 years
earlier. Clinton's attorney has issued a statement denying that
charge.
</P>
<P>
   However, Judicial Watch is asking the court for permission to
question Broaddrick about whether she felt intimidated shortly
before investigators in the House of Representatives' impeachment
probe interviewed her last year. Broaddrick has told reporters that
she noticed a man following her and that she found her home had
been broken into, with only her answering machine tape stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Broaddrick, who has said little publicly since last February
when she aired her rape allegation, told Cox Newspapers Wednesday,
``It was a strange feeling, knowing that there was no evidence of a
break-in, yet, my cat was out and tape was missing from (my)
answering machine.'' She added that ``I knew right then that I
would never feel safe again. It was something that I was going to
have to get used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch is also seeking to ask Flowers, a former Clinton
girlfriend, about remarks she made to CNN's Larry King about
threatening phone calls and a break-in at her home. Willey, a
former White House volunteer who has alleged Clinton groped her,
has publicly related several incidents, including allegations that
the tires were flattened on her car and threats from a stranger who
approached her outside her home.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the prospective witnesses was brushed aside in
the Kendall response. ``There is no place for such scandalous
'non-evidence' in this proceeding,'' the lawyer said. Further, he
asked the court to take the unusual step of erasing from the record
the references to these nine prospective witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Judicial Watch chairman Larry Klayman said
``the president is dismissing the seriousness of the charges
against him.'' He added that Clinton ``thinks he can get away with
his political spin machine rather than answering legitimate
questions.''

MORNING PROGRAMS SHOWING THEIR MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Ever imperturbable, Peter Jennings managed to
maintain a poker face Wednesday when he was told of a remark made
by the executive producer of ``Good Morning America,'' who
suggested that her program is or soon will be ``the flagship
broadcast of ABC News.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to assume that Jennings believes that title belongs to
the nightly newscast he anchors. But the claim by ``GMA'' honcho
Shelley Ross is not entirely farfetched.
</P>
<P>
   Once dismissed as the home of idle breakfast chatter, morning
programs like ``GMA'' and NBC's ``Today'' enjoy growing clout
within network news divisions for the most inescapable of reasons:
Their audiences are growing at a time when TV viewership is
dropping in every other time period throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``More viewers are coming to morning television than ever
before,'' remarked Charles Gibson, who coanchored ``GMA'' from 1987
to 1998 and returned to the program with Diane Sawyer in January.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the networks are pouring millions of dollars into
the morning programs, building new sets and hiring marquee talent.
The hotly competitive arena now boasts some of the biggest names at
each network: Katie Couric and Matt Lauer at top-rated ``Today,''
Sawyer and Gibson at No. 2 ``GMA,'' and Bryant Gumbel at CBS's
upcoming ``The Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an acknowledgment by all three of the major commercial
networks that morning television is important,'' said Gibson. ``The
devotion of resources now, by all three of the networks, is very
heartening.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are still too many silly stunts and fawning
over movie stars on the morning shows. But there is also some solid
journalism, and when it comes to big interview ``gets'' of major
newsmakers, the early broadcast hour and large audience often give
morning shows an edge over other network news programs. For
instance, when Hillary Clinton wanted to offer her spin on the
scandal engulfing her husband last year, she appeared on ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer, who had been out of morning television for 20 years
before returning with Gibson in January when their bosses implored
them to help turn around the faltering ``GMA,'' said she has been
struck by the change in the once-drowsy format.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's faster-paced,'' said Sawyer. ``It seems to me that it is
defining and sharpening the questions of the day in a way that it
didn't back then. And that's partly the pace at which we're all
moving and the fact that we all have so much more information right
away. We have the news right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity now, in a new way, to move beyond just
the headlines and try to tackle some question at the center that
hasn't been answered before.''
</P>
<P>
   One question Sawyer herself did not want to answer Tuesday was
why she was not on the air for two days following the fatal crash
of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane. Her absence had prompted
speculation that Sawyer, a friend of Kennedy's, was too
grief-stricken at his death to cover the story. But she denied
that, saying that unspecified ``personal obligations'' kept her off
the air on the Monday and Tuesday after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in this country felt the weight of the
tragedy,'' she said during an interview session at the semiannual
meeting of the Television Critics Association. ``And I'm not saying
that I didn't too, but that was not the reason. I did have other
personal considerations, and they are personal, and we (at ABC) all
discussed them, and I think I did the right thing, and I'm glad to
say my colleagues do too. ... I think some things should be
personal. I just do.''
</P>
<P>
   David Westin, the president of ABC News, said he supported
Sawyer's decision. He ticked off the names of other anchors
available to ABC _ Jennings, Ted Koppel, Barbara Walters, and
Connie Chung _ and said: ``If we didn't have that deep a bench and
we needed Diane and we couldn't cover the story, it might well have
come out a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the return of Gumbel to morning television will affect
the competitive landscape, Gibson called it a ``healthy'' instance
of ``shaking it up'' for all three networks. Gibson said he and
Sawyer, who were originally seen as temporary fill-ins on ``GMA''
but have improved the show's ratings, have committed to remain on
``GMA'' through next May.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings appeared before critics Wednesday by satellite to tout
``ABC 2000,'' the network's planned marathon coverage of events in
the US and around the world on New Year's Eve. The network has
forged a partnership with broadcasters in 60 countries in order to
cover what Jennings called a ``great historical event'' that will
be ``a celebration of mankind's accomplishments in the last 100
years and its anticipation for the next 100 years.''

JURY STILL OUT ON 49ERS' JIM DRUCKENMILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Given the way Jim Druckenmiller's career has
played out with the 49ers, the swell of camera crews and reporters
clamoring for his insights has seemed odd.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't Steve Young on the other end of those questions. It
was a third-year quarterback most observers had written off months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Druckenmiller still has a story or two to tell. His latest
involved a young woman lady in Virginia who accused him of raping
her earlier this year, an allegation that a jury in Montgomery
County,. Va., recently needed less than an hour to rule as false.
</P>
<P>
   So here Druck is again. Exonerated by one court and facing
judgment on the field, for when we last left him, his fate with the
49ers remained about as sketchy as the details in the claims of his
accuser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is behind me now,'' said Druckenmiller, who
declined discussing the specifics of the case. ``Now I can do what
I love again. I can concentrate on playing football and throwing
passes to receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the mass of media, Druckenmiller gave off that
same image that has dogged him throughout his pro career, that
oafish quality that leaves those with a pretentious bent
snickering.
</P>
<P>
   He always has come off as the guy you find at a 10-keg bash, the
gregarious drinker with a lampshade wedged over his head, and that
is one reason why the 49ers have never been high on him.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller has been expected to grow up over the last two
seasons and the indications are that he has yet to meet the team's
demands for maturity.
</P>
<P>
   So now he finds himself on the precipice of banishment, where
he's been since general manager Bill Walsh returned to run the team
in January. Walsh seems to view Druckenmiller as the antithesis of
a 49ers quarterback, and it will be was probably only a matter of
time before Druckenmiller finds found a pink slip in his locker.
</P>
<P>
   That's where his situation gets interesting. Though Walsh has
taken every opportunity to criticize Druckenmiller, there is little
reason to think the quarterback won't make this team come
September. Druckenmiller might even maintain his second-string
status.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Garcia, Walsh's candidate as the team's quarterback of the
future, hasn't been as impressive as Walsh claims he is. Steve
Stenstrom, the former Stanford star and Chicago Bear, is hoping to
just make the team. At this point, Druckenmiller looks as good as
anyone else in the lot and he'll fight with Garcia for the No. 2
spot. Said Walsh: ``The coaches feel like the position is wide-open
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Druck's knowledge of the offense is fine,'' said head coach
Steve Mariucci when asked for a progress report on Druckenmiller's
development. ``Now it's all about executing it. The most important
things for quarterbacks are decision-making, accuracy and timing
with decision-making being the key thing. That's where Druck needs
the preseason snaps and the practice time.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else Druck needed that he didn't have a few months ago
is relief. His accuser, a 21-year-old Virginia Tech graduate
student, filed rape charges in March, and Druckenmiller claims he
never feared a guilty verdict. He even has considered filing a
civil suit for defamation of character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize now that you're always in the public eye and under
scrutiny,'' Druckenmiller said. ``You're responsible for yourself
and those around you. That might not be fair, but that's the way it
is. The important thing is to keep myself out of certain situations
and surround myself with good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the end result was favorable for Druckenmiller, it only
added ammunition to those who believe that playing quarterback for
the 49ers requires both an articulate nature and a media-friendly
wit.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller already had problems with learning the offense and
harnessing his howitzer arm. Now, even in innocence, he can be
accused of bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Druckenmiller is used to playing against the odds and his
philosophy for this camp is no different from the one he has
adopted over the last two seasons. Even if people doubt him, he
will compete until somebody tells him his time here is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have something to prove every year,''
Druckenmiller said. ``No job is ever guaranteed. I'll come out here
with my gun loaded and firing and hopefully, I'll prove how good I
am.''

FOOD OF INDIAN SUBCONTINENT MARRIES FLAVORS FROM FAR CORNERS OF THE
WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Muslims don't eat pork. Many Hindus and Buddhists eat no meat.
Jains are so adherent to the rules of vegetarianism that they often
won't eat root vegetables because insects might be killed in the
harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   What does this add up to? A nation of parts that serves up a
gloriously vivid cuisine painted with spices and fruit and
vegetables and nuts and mounds and mounds of the most splendid rice
on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   India's food, like that of the world's, is a result of wars,
trading and conquering civilizations. But those fractious events,
and the resulting fractious population of Hindus, Muslims,
Christians, Buddhists and Sikhs, as well as some Jews, have melded
in a cuisine like no other.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a trade route between the spice islands of the East
Indies and the traders of the Middle East, Indian food gathered
ingredients from both. From Persia came the tradition of rice. From
the East came cardamom and cinnamon and coconut and ginger and
peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Generally _ and this a very loose generally _ the food of north
India has more emphasis on meat and that of the south features more
vegetables. There's more bread in the north, and rice is the
prevalent starch in the south.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the heat issue.
</P>
<P>
   The food does get spicier the farther south one travels in
Europe and Asia. This, again, is one of the influences of trade.
Portuguese traders landed on the coasts of India, bringing their
love of chile peppers. (There's also the long-held belief that hot
food in hotter climes induces perspiration, cooling the body.)
</P>
<P>
   One absolute truism is that curry powder is not, and we repeat,
not, an Indian product. This turmeric-laden, one-note concoction
was most likely an invention of British Raj veterans looking for
spices that would give them a quick curry fix.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing Indians have to curry powder is garam masala,
a combination of spices unique to nearly every home. (For the
spice-challenged, packaged garam masala is available at Indian
markets and at Penderey's Mexican Chile Supply in Fort Worth.) If
you don't intend to cook Indian food often, it's a good idea to go
ahead and purchase a mixture. Most from-scratch recipes require
roasting and toasting of spices and make quite a large amount that
will no doubt lose its potency before want to use it again.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a supply of fresh spices, Indian food is simple.
Techniques are basic _ grilling, braising and roasting predominate
_ and results are soul-satisfying. And best of all, no food is
better as a leftover. The flavors meld almost magically in the
refrigerator, letting you microwave tomorrow's dinner of ancient
flavors.

   2 1/2 pounds chicken pieces, skinned (leg quarters, breasts or a
combination of the two)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 juicy lemon
</P>
<P>
   16-ounce container yogurt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium onion, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   3/4-inch cube fresh ginger, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1/2 jalapeno or serrano pepper, roughly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons garam masala (available at Indian markets and at
Penderey's Mexican Chile Supply in Fort Worth)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons yellow liquid food coloring mixed with 1/2 to 1
1/2 tablespoons red liquid food coloring
</P>
<P>
   Lime wedges, optional
</P>
<P>
   Cut chicken leg quarters into 2 pieces and each breast into 4
pieces. Cut 2 long slits on each side of each part of the legs.
Slits should never start at an edge, and they should be deep enough
to reach the bone. Cut similar slits on the meaty side of each
breast piece.
</P>
<P>
   Spread chicken out on 1 or 2 large platters. Sprinkle half the
salt and squeeze the juice from three-quarters of the lemon over
them. Lightly rub the salt and lemon juice into the slits. Turn
chicken over and do the same on other side with remaining salt and
lemon juice. Set aside for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Combine yogurt, onion, garlic, ginger, jalapeno and garam masala
in an electric blender or food processor. Blend until you have a
smooth paste. Empty paste into a strainer set over a large ceramic
or stainless-steel bowl. Push paste through.
</P>
<P>
   Brush chicken pieces on both sides with the food coloring and
then put them, with any accumulated juices and any remaining food
coloring, into the bowl with the marinade. Mix well, making sure
marinade goes into slits in the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for
6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to its maximum temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Taking chicken out of the bowl, shake off as much of the
marinade as possible. Arrange chicken in large, shallow baking tray
in single layer. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until just done. Serve
hot, with lemon wedges.

   Grocery glossary
</P>
<P>
   Basmati rice: The incomparable aromatic rice grown in the
foothills of the Himalaya Mountains. This long-grain rice is an
Indian staple.
</P>
<P>
   Dals: Lentils are a mainstay in this often vegetarian culture.
They're packed with protein, and colors range all over the wheel
from red to white to black to green to yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Chutneys and pickles: An Indian meal isn't complete without a
selection of condiments that diners can use to customize their
meals. Some (such as lime pickle) are hotter than blazes; others
(such as sweet mango) are used to cut the heat of dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Garam masala: A spice combination made from as many recipes are
there are cooks. But the combo (usually including cumin, cinnamon,
cardamom, cloves and pepper) is also ground commercially and sold
ready-to-go. But like our ``seasoned salt'' concoctions, brands
vary in flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Ghee: This jarred, clarified butter is called for in many Indian
recipes. (Vegetable oil often substitutes in these days of
lower-fat cooking and works just as well.)
</P>
<P>
   Pappadam: Lentil-flour cracker breads usually served gratis at
the beginning of restaurant meals. These crackers come in
tortilla-size rounds or small, bite-size shapes. To prepare, simply
microwave, heat over a Jenn-Air sort of grill or fry in a small
amount of oil until they puff up.
</P>
<P>
   Patak-brand mixes: This popular brand of jarred pastes (they
also make pickles and chutneys) make whipping up a curry or a
tandoori dish a snap. For the tandoori mix, for instance, simply
combine the paste with yogurt, marinate chicken and slap on the
grill. A very exotic timesaver that's handy to have in the pantry.

<P>
   Books to read
</P>
<P>
   Madhur Jaffrey has long been the queen of Indian cookbook
authors. And it's her second career. This gentle-souled actress has
written books on other Asian cuisines, but her Indian ones remain
the jewels in the crown. My copy of ``Indian Cooking'' is
splattered with red and yellow spots from spices and marinades and
is falling apart at the spine. Yet, it's still the Indian book I
end up cooking from the most.
</P>
<P>
   Another must-check-out author is Ismail Merchant, one half of
the Merchant and Ivory film team. His books tend to have more
fusion elements _ blending Indian and European ingredients. His
celebrity-spiked headnotes are fun and his recipes are reliable.
His ``Passionate Meals'' is a delightful mix of stories and
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Sahni has written several encylopedic books about her
native fare. ``Classic India Cooking'' was a seminal book when
first published. Her more recent ``Introduction to Indian Cooking''
is more appropriate for the novice.

HATE ENDURES; ONLY THE TARGETS CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The caller sounds like a best friend, at least in the way that
she addresses me.
</P>
<P>
   But I doubt that she could ever be my friend.
</P>
<P>
   She sounds as if she is in her mid-30s to late 40s, probably
white. I could be wrong about that as well. That's the problem with
stereotypes. They're based on observed behavior and may even have a
grain of truth in them, but they ignore human complexity and
individuality.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, I'm simply shocked by what I observe. That's
how I feel about the amount of hatred simmering inside some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gracie, girl, I got news for you,'' the caller blared into my
voice mail last Sunday afternoon. ``That women's soccer team,
they're nothing but a bunch of sweaty, stinky ... dykies. That's
right, girl. Just like those dyke golf players, big old tough
linebacker golf-player women and those tennis-player girls. You
don't need to be glorifying them in a family newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to be sarcastic in reply is powerful. But you
remember that hate is a powerful emotion, and that stereotypes are
hard to change.
</P>
<P>
   I received that call in response to a column I wrote about the
U.S. women's soccer team. While decrying the lingering inequities
between men and women in the workplace and in sports, I cheered the
women's win over China.
</P>
<P>
   I thought their victory was a wonderful thing. I still do. It
never occurred to me to consider whether some members of the team
might be lesbians. Even assuming that the caller is right and there
are several lesbians on the team, I would feel the same way,
because their sexual preference isn't relevant to their
accomplishment. Not in my eyes. And, I hope, not in yours.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 20 years in this business, I thought I'd heard
it all. But listening to the woman's diatribe, I also learned a new
term with sexual connotations. I won't repeat it here.
</P>
<P>
   I am especially sensitive to this issue because of how
African-Americans have been stereotyped over the years.
</P>
<P>
   And although racism is still a big problem in this country, we
have made some progress. Fewer racists are wearing their hatred
like a badge these days.
</P>
<P>
   Homophobia, on the other hand, remains one of the last
acceptable bigotries in society, and people seem to be spewing
their venom at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought blacks made some Americans uncomfortable, that
doesn't compare with the way many people feel about homosexuals.
Lawyer Marvyn Kornberg would know what I'm talking about.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense of New York cop Justin Volpe, Kornberg argued
that Haitian immigrant Abner Louima's injuries were not the result
of Volpe sodomizing him with a broomstick. Instead, he contended,
Louima had had sex with a man.
</P>
<P>
   His defense failed, but not only because it was a lie. It failed
because other officers testified against Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Shepard, the University of Wyoming student, should be so
lucky. He had a jury of two homophobes who pistol-whipped him to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Scott Amedure? He revealed during an un-aired episode
of ``The Jenny Jones Show'' that he had a romantic interest in
Jonathan Schmitz. Three days later, Schmitz killed Amedure. Schmitz
was convicted of the slaying, but the conviction was overturned on
a technicality.
</P>
<P>
   The point of my column last week was simply that while cheering
the success of the U.S. women's soccer team, we need to remember
that gender inequities still exist. The caller seems to think that
by acknowledging the victory, I was out to glorify homosexuality.
Frankly, sexual orientation never entered my mind.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me, however, that hate still exists. Only the
targets change.

<P>
   A:.MDNM/ You may be thinking of the John Newcombe Tennis Ranch
in New Braunfels, which offers programs for younger players from
ages 8 to 18 and for adult players.
</P>
<P>
   Weeklong summer camps for younger players begin each Sunday
through Aug. 15 this year. The cost is $525 for one week and $425

First, there was the highly-criticized decision to drop the
season-opening football game at Florida State and that was followed
by a decision to release six players from their scholarship. All of
this followed a frustrating 1998 season which saw coach Terry
Bowden resign and interim coach Bill Oliver sue the university

she came out of nowhere to make it to the semi-finals. An even
bigger bombshell was the revelation that her father _ thanks to an
extra-marital dalliance _ was none other than basketball great
Julius ``Dr. J.'' Erving. Alexandra will compete at the Pan
American Games, beginning today. There is a news conference
featuring her Wednesday, at which time _ for the first time _ among
other things, she will talk about her father and her life since a
Fort Lauderdale newspaper discovered the name of her father.

COLUMN: ONE BIG, HAPPY GARLIC-BREAD FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday, July 30)  
(yn) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do your family dinners have all the peace and tranquillity of an
English soccer riot? Chances are, you're not serving enough
Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread.
</P>
<P>
   According to a story in the May issue of Harper's, scientific
research has shown that the mood of a family dinner can be
dramatically improved by serving Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread. (I
suspect that the mood of a family dinner can also be dramatically
improved if each family member eats in a separate room, but let us
leave that for another time.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan R. Hirsch, director of the Smell &AMP; Taste Treatment and
Research Foundation in Chicago, recently published a paper titled,
appropriately enough, ``The Effect of the Smell and Taste of
Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread on Family Interactions.'' Two
identical spaghetti dinners were served to 50 (presumably
unidentical) families, but only half were given garlic bread. The
researchers found that eating Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread reduced
the number of negative family interactions by 22.7 percent and
increased the number of pleasant interactions by 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From this, Hirsch calculated that, for a family of four, a
serving of Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread results in 31 fewer
negative interactions and 45 more positive interactions per dinner.
</P>
<P>
   This study raises several questions in my mind. Number one, I
wonder how many more times I have to write the words ``Pepperidge
Farm'' before Campbell Soup, the parent company of Pepperidge Farm,
lays a big wad of cash on me like it did on Hirsch so that he could
finance this ground-breaking (crust breaking?) piece of scientific
research on Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I am questioning the validity of Hirsch's research. I
think Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread is a fine product, undoubtedly
superior to other garlic breads not made by Pepperidge Farm. My
family and I have enjoyed many pleasant meals, alone in our
separate rooms, in which a Pepperidge Farm product _ quite possibly
Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread _ was a key component.
</P>
<P>
   Another question I have is whether the 25 families that were not
served Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread sat in the same room with the
25 families that were served Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread. Watching
other families enjoy Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread when you have
none is bound to increase negative family interactions, including a
lot of bickering over whose fault it is that they got Pepperidge
Farm Garlic Bread and you did not.
</P>
<P>
   I also wonder if the Pepperidge-Farm-Garlic-Bread group's lower
rate of negative family interactions was due more to the fact that
they had extra food to chew on, and therefore less time to speak,
than the families that were not served Pepperidge Farm Garlic
Bread. Most, if not all, dinner-table arguments could be avoided if
family members used their mouths for chewing only. By this
reasoning, the families that were given Pepperidge Farm Garlic
Bread would have been just as pleasant and convivial if they had
been served a side dish of leftover haggis, tofu or some other
foodlike substance not found in Pepperidge Farm's fine line of
products.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one has to wonder how Hirsch differentiated negative
family interactions from positive family interactions. A simple
request like ``pass the salt'' can be interpreted as either a
positive or a negative depending on the tone and context. ``Pass
the salt, you smelly little creep!'' is almost universally
recognized as a negative family interaction. (``Maybe you'd like to
wear that spaghetti, you ferret-faced jerk!'' is another.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, these questions are in no way intended to cast
aspersions, worms, artificial lures or anything else one might
think to cast upon Hirsch's research paper, titled, as you may or
may not recall, ``The Effect of the Smell and Taste of Pepperidge
Farm Garlic Bread on Family Interactions'', nor will they dissuade
me from serving Pepperidge Farm Garlic Bread at our next family
dinner, and every dinner thereafter, as long as we continue to eat
in separate rooms.

SOUTH AFRICAN LEGAL GROUP APOLOGIZES FOR ACTIONS AGAINST GANDHI 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ One hundred and five years after it
tried to keep Mohandas K. Gandhi from practicing law because he was
``not of European descent,'' the Natal Law Society has
unconditionally apologized for its actions.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi, who had moved to South Africa to represent an
Indian-based trading company, was the first nonwhite to apply for
credentials from the society, which promptly turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   The society, the equivalent of the bar association, listed
several technical reasons for objecting to Gandhi in addition to
his race. But when Gandhi appealed his case, the country's chief
justice admitted him to the bar.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the society said, ``The society apologizes
unconditionally, albeit posthumously, to the late Mahatma Gandhi
for having attempted to restrict his rights to practice as an
advocate in Natal.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that the apology also extended to ``all other aspirant
lawyers whose access to the profession was restricted in any way on
the basis of racial grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   David Randles, the president of the society, said that over the
years the society had noted numerous calls for it to apologize
unreservedly for its racist treatment of Gandhi, who arrived as a
young lawyer in South Africa in 1893.
</P>
<P>
   During his nearly 20 years here, Gandhi _ inspired by being
forced out of a first-class car on a train even though he had paid
for a first-class ticket _ developed his philosophy of passive
resistance and led numerous human rights protest marches and
strikes, resulting in his imprisonment on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching an agreement with the South African government on
Indian rights, Gandhi returned to India in 1914, eventually leading
his country to full independence from Britain in 1947. He was shot
dead by a Hindu fanatic in New Delhi, India, on Jan. 30, 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the society has made several attempts to
apologize, but the attempts have all been found wanting, Randles
said. Calls for a further apology kept cropping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be unambiguous in our apology and put the matter
to rest,'' Randles said. ``This is really a very well-intentioned
apology.''

   Counting the Hours
</P>
<P>
   Q: My cosmos sensation mix has lovely ferny foliage, but not a
single bloom, no hint of a bud for that matter. They have been
fertilized and get plenty of sun. What is the problem? I have never
had trouble with these easy care plants before.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: The cosmos timetable is nearly as strict as a Swiss train
schedule. Cosmos bipinnatus, whose tall, lithe stalks hold magenta,
pink or white flowers, are short-day plants. Dr. Allan Armitage,
professor of horticulture at the University of Georgia in Athens,
said that short-day plants initiate flower production only when the
photoperiod, or day length, is shorter than a certain length. In
the New York area, from May 1st until August 11th the days are
longer than 14 hours.
</P>
<P>
   If the plants did not start the process of making flower buds in
the spring, perhaps because they were stressed by the heat or were
too young, they will patiently wait until long enough after the
summer solstice that the daylight is once again less than 14 hours.
In the meantime, they will continue to keep an eye on the clock and
just grow taller. When they do flower, you'll be practically eye to
eye with them.
</P>
<P>
   But if a few of them never flower, blame genetics, not the
calendar. C. bipinnatus sensation mix is not a highly controlled
hybrid, where the performance of every plant is uniform. Their
genetic diversity means that among the variations in a population
there may be a few blind plants, those that never flower. Enjoy the
foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Too Hot to Work
</P>
<P>
   Q: My tomato plants look terrific, seem to be healthy and have
produced many flowers, but there have been only a few tomatoes. I
water and fertilize but most of the flowers just drop off. Am I
going to get any more tomatoes this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are just taking a heat break and will start working
again once it cools off a bit. Pollen is very sensitive to heat and
changes chemically if the temperature reaches 95 degrees Fahrenheit
or over.
</P>
<P>
   For tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, pumpkins, cucumbers and
squash, the change is deadly. The pollen no longer fertilizes the
flowers, and they drop off, victims of unrequited love.
</P>
<P>
   Since you can't prevent the heat, apply Wall Street's advice to
your vegetable portfolio _ diversify and spread your risk. Choose
varieties with different maturation times and stagger the planting,
so that your garden is producing early, midsummer and late crops.
</P>
<P>
   Raspberry Know-How
</P>
<P>
   Q: My raspberries have become a true bramble patch. I've never
been sure about how or when to prune them, so I have avoided the
whole problem. Can you tell how and when to prune so I can take
back my yard?
</P>
<P>
   A: Assuming you have picked this summer's berries without
receiving too many cuts and scratches from your overgrown
raspberries, gather your pruners, heavy gloves and courage, and
head outside.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding how raspberries live is the key to getting the
most from them. While their roots are perennial, their canes are
biennial, dying after the second growing year. Summer-bearing
raspberries act like true biennials: the first year is for
producing leaves, and the second is for flower and fruit
production. After that, the dead canes just stand around
interfering with berry picking. Every year, raspberries send up new
canes, so the penalty for not pruning _ rampant sprawl and painful
harvests _ mounts up.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant way to prune summer-bearing raspberries is to cut
canes at soil level in the summer after they are finished fruiting,
and then prune out all but the strongest four or five new canes in
the spring once they are 8- or 10-inches high.
</P>
<P>
   Some raspberries, however, put their own twist on the rules.
Called fall bearing or everbearing, they produce fruit at the tops
of the canes in late summer or early fall of the first year and
again lower down on the canes during midsummer of the second year.
</P>
<P>
   If you only want to prune summer-bearing raspberries once each
year, do it in the spring. Completely remove both the canes that
produced fruit the previous summer (look for old, cracking bark on
the two-year old canes) and as many of the brand new canes as
necessary to control the size of the plant. Everbearing raspberries
can simply be cut to the ground each spring. You'll get only the
late crop of berries, but you don't have to decide which canes are
two years old and which are only one, you simply whack them all
back.

   GWBUSH-FAITH _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush argues that
``faith-based'' programs can transform lives in ways that
government can't, and he has pushed hard for more ties between
Texas and ``faith-based'' and community groups since 1996. But as
he seeks to take the idea national in his presidential bid, Texas
officials don't have solid empirical evidence on performance and
critics worry about violating the separation of church and state.
While there are many questions, the programs have lots of
supporters because they can provide what government can't:
confidence and faith in oneself. (Greenberger, Austin

FRANCE ORDERED TO PAY $100,000 FOR TORTURING DRUG DEALER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France, a country that has proudly enshrined human
rights since 1789, was ordered by the European Court of Human
Rights on Wednesday to pay the equivalent of $100,000 to a
convicted Dutch-Moroccan drug dealer for violating his rights with
police ``torture'' to make him confess.
</P>
<P>
   France thus joined Turkey as the only two of the 41 member
countries of the Council of Europe to be found guilty of torture by
a court sitting on French territory in Strasbourg, an embarrassment
that Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou suffered in silence when
asked for reaction by journalists Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The court, established in 1959, found that Ahmed Selmouni, 57,
had suffered heavy blows over almost all of his body in ``repeated
and sustained assaults'' over at least four days of questioning by
the police in the Paris suburb of Bobigny in November 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under these circumstances, the court was satisfied that the
physical and mental violence, considered as a whole, committed
against the applicant's person had caused `severe' pain and
suffering and had been particularly serious and cruel,'' the
decision said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such conduct had to be regarded as acts of torture for the
purposes of Article 3 of the Convention,'' the court said,
referring to the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Selmouni, serving a 13-year sentence in Montmedy prison, sued
French authorities in 1992, saying he had been kicked, beaten with
a baseball bat to the point of losing sight in his left eye, and
sexually abused with a police billy club.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous European Court ruling said the charges of rape and
eye damage were not substantiated by the medical reports available
to it, but it said, ``The court also observed that the applicant
had been subjected to a certain number of acts which would have
been heinous and humiliating for anyone, irrespective of their
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17 judges, including one from France, also found that French
justice had taken an unreasonably long time, more than six and a
half years, to act on accusations by Selmouni and one of his
accomplices after they formally complained of police brutality a
year after their arrests.
</P>
<P>
   French prosecutors took years to investigate Selmouni's
complaints of torture and sexual abuse, finally charging five
police officers in 1997. They were tried in 1998 for assault and
``indecent assault committed collectively and with violence and
coercion.'' A criminal court in Versailles last March convicted and
sentenced four of them to three-year jail terms, and ordered the
immediate arrest of their commanding officer, Bernard Herve, and
giving him a four-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict brought nationwide protests by angry police
officers, but the sentences were reduced and suspended by a
Versailles appeals court on July 1, except for the three months
that Herve had spent behind bars, and the charge of sexual abuse
was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   More appeals in that case are under way, and Selmouni could also
try to reopen his conviction on drug smuggling charges. With the
backing of the Netherlands, he asked the European Court to transfer
him to a Dutch prison to serve out the rest of his term there, but
the court said it had no jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   It awarded him $18,383 in costs and expenses and $81,080 in
damages, a fifth of the amount he had claimed.

SENATE OVERCOMES BID TO PREVENT PASSAGE OF GUN-CONTROL LEGISLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate overcame an attempt Wednesday by Sen.
Bob Smith, I-N.H., to prevent the passage of gun-control
legislation, voting to begin conference negotiations with the House
aimed at producing a final juvenile justice bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the bill contains several new gun-control
measures to keeping certain weapons out of the hands of minors and
criminals by initiating tougher gun show background checks and
prohibiting the import of high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill does not include any gun-control measures, but it
does contain a number of so-called ``cultural'' measures, such as
allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed in schools, which
many senators find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders are hoping to fashion a compromise with the House
that will allow some gun-control measures to remain in the final
bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, a conservative who recently left the Republican Party
to pursue the presidency as an independent candidate, has sought to
undermine that effort by holding up administration nominees to
government positions and by employing other parliamentary tactics
to keep new gun-control legislation from becoming a reality.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant Smith took to the floor after the vote Tuesday to
denounce both Republicans and Democrats who support gun-control
legislation and to urge voters to defeat them at the polls,
regardless of party affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   He also called on the House negotiators to remain firm in
opposing gun-control legislation, calling the House juvenile
justice bill a far superior piece of legislation to the Senate
proposal. It would restore ``religion and values'' to America's
classrooms, he said. He described the Senate as an instrument of a
``tyrannical government'' determined to take away the right of
Americans to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend more time trying to deny religion and values in our
schools than we do with our kids,'' said Smith, adding that no
amount of gun control will help stop the kind of youth violence
that resulted in the deaths of 14 students and one teacher earlier
this year at Columbine High School in Littleton, Col.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moral decadence is the problem, not gun control,'' he said,
accusing gun-control advocates of taking ``advantage of terrible
tragedy'' in Colorado ``to mount an assault on the Second
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill approved last month would crack down on juvenile
crime in a variety of ways, including tougher court penalties. But
it also includes a requirement for background checks, taking up to
three business days, on all sales at gun shows, as well as a
requirement that safety locks be sold with all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal to the American people for help in fighting
gun-control legislation, Smith denounced the nation's judicial
system for allowing ``murderers'' and other criminals freedom after
serving minimal sentences. He said criminals were being treated
more fairly than victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some like Mr. Simpson,'' Smith said, referring to the O.J.
Simpson trial in which he was found not guilty of killing his
former wife Nicole, ``never go to prison when they should.''
</P>
<P>
   House GOP leaders have said they are ready to begin negotiations
with the Senate. But House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has
indicated that he would like to see some of the Senate gun-control
measures incorporated into the House bill, despite that many of
them were rejected last month in House votes.

THE WORLD OF THE SIDESHOW MAKES A MODEST RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For generations of Americans, it was the high point of the year:
the arrival of the circus, with its smells and noises, odd
personalities, exotic animals _ and its sideshow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the spiel of the barker, from the middle 19th century
to the mid-20th century, Americans paid their hard-earned nickels
to ``step right up'' for the privilege of viewing human and animal
deformities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sideshow is back _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 version of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey's ``The
Greatest Show On Earth,'' features attractions reminiscent of acts
from the heyday of the circus earlier this century.
</P>
<P>
   There are no three-legged humans or animals, no bearded ladies,
``Siamese'' twins or monumentally obese people such as those who
filled the ``freak shows'' of yore. There are, as part of the main
circus performance, a few tasteful, politically correct acts
recalling the past _ such as the world's tallest man, the smallest
man on Earth, the contortionist ``lady in the cube'' and a
fire-breathing ``human volcano.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it a trend or just a blip?
</P>
<P>
   If cultural indicators are to be believed, the sideshow is now
nearly mainstream. In the mid-1990s, ``Side Show,'' a Broadway
musical about conjoined twins who were part of the old sideshow
circuit, was judged an artistic if not a financial success. A few
seasons earlier, ``Freak Show,'' an off-Broadway production in the
tradition of the ``The Fantasticks,'' explored the psychology of
the freak-show attraction. The Jim Rose Circus _ a sado-masochistic
reinterpretation of sideshows involving ground glass,
regurgitation, razor blades and self-inflicted torture of external
organs _ is a current favorite attraction on the rock-concert
circuit. And an upcoming film about conjoined twins, ``Twin Falls
Idaho,'' was inspired by the story of 19th-century circus twins
Chang and Eng Bunker.
</P>
<P>
   LaVahn Hoh, a professor of drama at the University of Virginia _
and an official spokesman for the circus on its history _ sees a
real comeback in process, although in a changed form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional sideshow died out as our culture changed,'' he
says. ``We don't like to look at human suffering now.'' He points
out, however, that attendance at circuses is up, and that the
revived sideshow offers something completely different for a new
generation. ``We have a generation that is growing up that hasn't
seen a contortionist,'' he says. ``The circus is bringing that
back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Bogdan, professor of sociology and education at
Syracuse University in New York and author of ``Freak Show,'' a
history of the sideshow, doubts that the sideshow is making a
genuine comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a long-term thing,'' Bogdan says. ``The circus is a
fringe entertainment nowadays. For some time, it was the main
entertainment for rural Americans. But it's not a central
institution anymore. This sideshow is just a gasp for breath by a
drowning institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogdan says that the niche for freak shows nowadays is taken by
TV talk shows, which he refers to as ``emotional and lifestyle
freak shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts may argue over the historical significance _ or
insignificance _ of the current fad for sideshows and related acts,
but a few people do live the lives of sideshow attractions.
</P>
<P>
   As in generations past, a job with the circus can be a godsend
for the physically unique person. Pakistani-born Aurangzeb Khan,
37, is billed as the ``World's Tallest Man.'' At 8 feet tall and
380 pounds, Khan had difficulty earning enough money to buy clothes
and food in his native Pakistan. Life is easier now: ``I enjoy
it,'' he says. ``I have a big mobile home, made especially for me.
Everything is the right size.'' He earns his salary signing
autographs, greeting the crowd and providing a massive frame on
which smaller people perform acrobatic acts.
</P>
<P>
   Although some acts don't require besides physical uniqueness,
others demand extraordinary skill and mental focus.
</P>
<P>
   Human cannonball Mark Myers, 28, went to clown college after
high school and was working as a circus clown when he became
interested in his current occupation. He finds the work
exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like being teleported,'' he says, recalling the first
time he was shot from a cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Myers estimates that he is shot from a cannon about 450 times a
year in his travels with the circus. He remains constantly aware of
the physical risk; his mentor is paralyzed from the waist down from
overshooting the net because the shooting mechanism was adjusted
incorrectly. Myers realizes that it's a short career _ five to
seven years at most _ and plans to develop his acting skills when
he retires from the circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who is physically fit and who is in shape could do
it,'' says Myers, who is a trim 145 pounds on a 5-foot-7 frame.
``The most difficult part is the mental part. I try and keep myself
psyched up, and keep my energy up. On the days when I do it well,
it's beautiful. Time stands still. It's like flying in your
dreams.''

   If driving at night has recently become more difficult, don't
necessarily blame your headlights. Once you move out of your 20s,
there's a good chance that the problem has nothing to do with your
car's equipment and everything to do with your age.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers are getting old, and one sign of that is a loss of
visual acuity. ``When you're 45, you need 50 percent more light to
see as well as you did when you were 25,'' said Jeff Erion,
lighting manager for Visteon Automotive Systems in Dearborn, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the largest group of geezers in history, the automobile
industry has an economic incentive to make things brighter. The
relaxation of federal regulations and the advent of powerful
computer software have made it possible for the industry to create
new headlight designs in record time.
</P>
<P>
   In any headlight, the light needs to be properly dispersed. A
headlight bulb generates light back toward an aluminum-coated
reflector, which then reflects it toward the front of the
headlight, which may have a plastic or glass lens. In a traditional
parabolic headlight, up to 200 separate facets on the lens direct
the light onto the road, which insures that the beam is wide
enough, evenly spread and aimed in the correct direction to
illuminate road signs, while not shining in oncoming drivers'
faces.
</P>
<P>
   There are other designs as well: jeweled headlights do not use
lenses, while projection-beam headlights do.
</P>
<P>
   The newest trend is the jeweled, completely clear, headlight.
Stare into a jeweled headlight (unlighted, if you're smart) and you
can see through it to the back of the reflector. Showing up on
models from nearly all makers, these lights ``give the front of the
car a more three-dimensional look,''Erion said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1980s, there was little designers could do to improve
either a car headlight's output or looks because headlights,
according to lighting engineers, were the most regulated part of a
vehicle. Cars manufactured for sale in this country had to meet
stringent guidelines for headlight size, shape, placement and
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   All lights had to be sealed beams, in which the lens, light and
reflector are in one unit, and had to be mounted in either one or
two pairs. A good result of such standardization was that it kept
prices down for replacing headlight units.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, federal guidelines had been eased. Headlights
can now be any shape _ as long as the rules governing the lights'
brightness, throw (how far the beam extends) and direction are
followed. Ford's 1986 Taurus was one of the first models to use
aerodynamic headlights that were flush with the sheet metal. And
headlights no longer have to be replaced as a unit; lights can now
use replaceable, brighter halogen bulbs, the kind that have been
used by most manufacturers outside the United States
</P>
<P>
   The first aerodynamic headlights using replaceable bulbs had a
different shape but performed no better than their sealed-beam
predecessors. Engineers still needed to find an elegant compromise
that would allow them to put enough light in the right places along
the road without blinding oncoming drivers. Every time a new
headlight shape is created, that process begins anew.
</P>
<P>
   The lighting industry has toyed with a number of solutions to
increase nighttime illumination. Manufacturers have experimented
with headlights that can reflect ultraviolet light up to twice the
distance of conventional lamps, but for such lights to be
effective, all road signs (and pedestrians' clothing) would have to
be coated with UV-reflective paint.
</P>
<P>
   BMW, Lexus and other manufacturers have tried projection-beam
headlights, which use fish-eye lenses to concentrate the light and
make it appear brighter. While projection lamps are good at
reducing stray light and glare from raindrops, ``there's a great
flood of foreground light with projection lenses, but not so much
in the distance,'' Erion said.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the art today is high-intensity-discharge lighting.
Rather than using a glowing filament to create light, HID lamps use
high voltage to generate a bluish spark between two electrodes,
exciting the xenon gas and leading to the emission of a bluish
light.
</P>
<P>
   These headlights create brighter illumination within government
standards. Because the light is blue, it appears brighter still.
HID lights are still expensive; most are found on luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   Car models that appeal to older buyers tend to have headlights
that throw more light directly in front of the car, said Jeff
Mikel, senior vice president of the Guide Corp., a lighting
supplier, while those that appeal to younger people will often have
headlights that project light a greater distance.
</P>
<P>
   Without computers, it would take weeks of trial and error to
create a jeweled headlight. Unlike a regular headlamp, these may
have only 20 discernible reflecting facets, so each must be angled
precisely to throw the light,Mickel said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next decade, expect to see HID lighting on less expensive
cars and the introduction of a light engine,a single lighting
source that will transmit illumination via fiber-optic cable to
light up headlights, taillights and turn signals.

 &HT;    Surgeon General Issues Call To Action To Combat Suicide
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS CDC website to read www.cdc.gov/ncipc.)
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Surgeon General David Satcher, accompanied by
Tipper Gore and leaders of an Atlanta-based suicide prevention
network, on Wednesday issued a ``call to action'' to combat suicide
in America.
</P>
<P>
   Although suicide is the country's eighth leading cause of death
_ accounting for nearly 31,000 deaths in 1996, compared with about
20,000 homicides _ victims of life-threatening despondency are
often ashamed to seek help, Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief White House meeting, Satcher unveiled a national
strategy to increase research on suicide prevention and educate the
public on the causes and signs of impending suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must reduce the stigma of mental illness that keeps so many
people from seeking the help that could save their lives,'' Satcher
said at meeting at which he announced the suicide prevention
effort. ``People should not be afraid or ashamed to seek help.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher called on people he described as ``natural community
helpers'' _ such as religious leaders, teachers, hairdressers and
even Little League coaches _ to learn how to recognize the signs of
potentially fatal depression and intervene.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to actual deaths, about 500,000 Americans are
treated in emergency rooms every year after attempting suicide,
Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, Satcher was
accompanied by Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.,
Doris Smith, who is the president of the Atlanta-based Suicide
Prevention Advocacy Network (SPAN), and Chris Marshall, a
37-year-old Norfolk, Va., man who attempted suicide after years of
struggle with a mysterious condition diagnosed as panic disorder,
depression and ``social phobia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I was six years old, I knew something was wrong
with me,'' Marshall said. ``I had a deep sense of fear. I would get
dizzy and sweat and fear that I was going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he continued to suffer ``vicious and
humiliating panic attacks, over and over,'' a family doctor said he
was merely suffering from a ``case of nerves,'' which he would get
over.
</P>
<P>
   He said his parents worried constantly about him and took him to
specialists, but the drugs they prescribed didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he said, a succession of failures in college and
at various jobs, caused him to ``turn on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to live on my parents' farm, and after several months
with no relief from my symptoms, I could no longer take it,'' he
said. ``I became numb. On a starry night, I took my father's
shotgun and walked out onto a field. I was crying as I walked.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been plagued with ``visions of killing myself''
because of ``my sick brain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loaded the gun and held the barrel to my forehead. I could
not do it. By some grace, in a completely numb state, I was able to
grasp hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Marshall said, he met a young woman who encouraged him to
try medication again and finally an antidepressant drug began to
relieve the irrational fears that had plagued him nearly all his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have a good job and I'm getting married (to the girl who
encouraged him to return to medication) next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group most at risk is senior citizens, who account for 20
percent of all suicides, Satcher said. Reid described the day in
1984 when, as lieutenant governor of Nevada, he got a telephone
call from his mother, who told him, ``Your pop shot himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Present in the audience were Jerry and Elsie Weyrauch, the
Marietta, Ga., couple who founded SPAN 11 years ago, following the
suicide of their oldest daughter, Terri.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Smith read a suicide letter left by her son, Mark Allen
Smith, who shot himself in the head in 1992 in their Atlanta home,
while studying for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   A student leader in high school and college and a gifted
musician, Mark, ``although we didn't know it, was suffering from
depression,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret this had to happen on your birthday,'' he wrote. He
also apologized that he did ``not have more to say to you, other
than to say I love you very, very much and please tell my father I
love him too.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she ``did not know that depression was a disease that
could be treated or that you can get help.''
</P>
<P>
   She said after his death the family was shunned and was told
that ``blacks did not commit suicide'' and that ``if you commit
suicide, you will go to Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said suicide is ``not something that happens to other
people. It happens to people we know. It happens to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, join me in breaking the silence,'' she said to a
gathering of about 100 persons, most of whom seemed to be
associated with SPAN. ``Together we will save lives, replace stigma
with acceptance, ignorance with understanding and fear with hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he hoped a resolution which he and Reid introduced in
Congress several years ago would send a message to people that
``it's OK. It's all right to talk about our feelings of despair, of
hopelessness, of suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, we have to tell people that it's good to seek
help,'' he said. ``We must face this problem head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said the national strategy would involve such agencies
as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health
Resources and Services Administration, the Indian Health Service
and the National Institute of Mental Health, the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration, as well as private
groups like SPAN, the Ad Council, Ronald McDonald House Charities
and the American School Counselors Association.

(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Picnics _ designed for enjoying a beautiful day or
evening outdoors _ are all a matter of style. They can range from
humble spur-of-the-moment outings to more elegant affairs geared to
enjoy an evening at a concert under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the virtues of a picnic is its flexibility,'' writes
Barbara Scott-Goodman in her new book, ``Picnics'' (Chronicle
Books; $12.95). ``A picnic can be held almost anywhere: at the
beach in the late afternoon, in the woods during a hike, on a boat
at the lake, on the roadside while traveling with the family, in
the park before a concert. Closer to home, a picnic can be casual,
under a tree in the back yard, or on the deck or patio, or it can
be formal, such as an alfresco dinner on the terrace with
candlelight.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning an impromptu picnic can take a few quick minutes to
hastily grab a blanket or towel, load the cooler with a few
sandwiches prepared from on-hand pantry or refrigerator
ingredients, potato chips, paper plates and cans of your favorite
beverages and head for the park or beach. Or when there's more
time, organizers can plan in advance and coordinate the seasonal
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Composing a picnic involves creating a harmonious mixture of
foods with complementary flavors and textures. Numerous
configurations are feasible, depending on your schedule and the
preparation time available to coordinate your efforts. Peruse the
recipes that follow _ and mix and match to personalize your picnic
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to suit food selections to the venue and the people who
will be going on the picnic. Children find the simplest foods
appealing _ and you don't have to impress them. Peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches will do.
</P>
<P>
   When you're looking for something quick, consider filling a
baguette with slices of brie or buffalo mozzarella cheese, fresh
basil and garden-fresh tomato slices. Top with a drizzle of
pesto-flavored olive oil, wrap in foil and tote with a sharp knife.
</P>
<P>
   Leftover chicken can be turned into a wonderful chicken salad or
just layered in pita bread with roasted red peppers, basil, cheese
slices and olive tapenade (either prepared or homemade). You can
also roll up thinly sliced roast beef or cooked turkey with a sour
cream and horseradish mixture, chopped green onions and tomatoes in
sheets of lavosh (available in the bread section of supermarkets)
for a fast portable feast.
</P>
<P>
   An antipasto platter is another fast idea that you can rustle up
in a jiffy with jars of olives, roasted red peppers, marinated
artichoke hearts and mushrooms, slices of buffalo or other
mozzarella cheese or provolone, salami and mortadella slices along
with fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil and vinegar, if
desired. Accompany with slices of rustic Italian or olive bread _
and the feast is on.
</P>
<P>
   Some tips for picnickers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan ahead and make a list to avoid forgetting anything
crucial like plates, utensils, napkins, can opener, etc. Check off
the list before departing.
</P>
<P>
   _ While beautiful picnic baskets are nice, they're not
mandatory. Coolers, and canvas and straw bags of all sizes work
well, too. Check out the colorful and sturdy acrylic and plastic
plates and utensils _ from places like Target, Kmart,
Bloomingdale's and Crate &AMP; Barrel _ which can jazz up the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select food items that travel well. Avoid saucy or drippy
items or desserts like custards or creme brulees. Instead opt for
cookies or a pan-baked cake. Assorted individual fresh fruits _ be
sure they are rinsed in advance _ are good choices.
</P>
<P>
   _ To keep the picnic interesting and fun, opt for a couple of
creative or novel dishes _ or classic favorites with new twists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't feel obligated to spend hours in the kitchen preparing a
feast. Supermarket delis and neighborhood takeout places with a
variety of ethnic choices are happy to supply you with innovative
and tasty fare. See the accompany list for some possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Or when the picnic mood strikes and there's no time to cook,
you can create a spur-of-the-moment feast by picking up a selection
of cheese wedges, pates, cooked meats, bread, fruit, wine, even a
bar of chocolate and cookies to pack in your basket.
</P>
<P>
   _ For ease and convenience and to avoid a messy hassle at the
site, do as much in advance as possible before toting the food. For
instance, butter bread and rolls before leaving home. If possible,
toss vegetable salads with dressing just before heading out the
door. If planning to serve items like chicken or other salads on
greens, take advantage of the many cleaned bagged salad mixes on
the market and open them just before serving on location.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select the picnic site before leaving home to save time and
assist in planning. If you're going to the beach, towels, folding
chairs, toys for playing in the sand, etc. make sense. The park may
dictate blankets, folding chairs (unless picnic tables and chairs
are available there), a plastic table cloth, balls, Frisbees, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once you arrive at the site, survey the area and look for a
level spot free of tree roots or holes to lay out your blanket and
picnic. Consider locating near trees so you'll have some shade.
Pick a spot where you can view a large area, particularly if you
are taking children.
</P>
<P>
   _ To prevent moisture from seeping through your blanket on the
ground, bring a large piece of plastic or a tarp to put underneath.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pack cold foods with other cold foods to keep them cool en
route to the picnic. The same goes for hot foods _ do not pack cold
and hot foods in the same cooler or picnic basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be too careful when handling and packing food for
cooking and eating outdoors,'' notes Scott-Goodman. Summer heat
increases the chance of bacterial growth in foods, especially those
that are high in protein and moisture _ including meats, poultry,
seafood, dairy products and eggs _ she points out.
</P>
<P>
   So heed food-safety basics, including washing your hands before
and after food handling and cleaning cutting surfaces and utensils
with hot soapy water after each use.
</P>
<P>
   Keep all foods prepared ahead of time refrigerated. Just before
leaving for your picnic destination, pack cold foods in a cooler

RECIPE FOR CREATING HUMAN CANCER CELLS IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., France)  (th) 
 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using a precise molecular recipe, scientists have succeeded in
turning normal human cells into cancer cells in the laboratory, a
taskthat sounded simple but which eluded molecular biologists for
more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what was required was just three genes. One pushed
cells to grow unrelentingly, one inactivated signals for cells to
stop growing and the third released a brake on the cells' life
span.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the work, by Dr. Robert A. Weinberg and his
colleagues at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in
Cambridge, Mass., appears Thursday in the journal Nature. It is
accompanied by a commentary by Dr. Jonathan B. Weitzman and Dr.
Moshe Yaniv of the Institut Pasteur in Paris, which calls it a
``landmark paper.''
</P>
<P>
   While the researchers said the discovery will not lead
immediately to a new treatment or cure for human cancer, they said
they believe it may one day allow them to determine the blueprints
for turning healthy cells into tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the biology of a human cancer cell is a black box,''
Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally occurring tumor cells are so deranged and vary so much
from patient to patient that it is hard for scientists to
understand which genetic changes are important.
</P>
<P>
   When looking at the end product, a cancer cell, it is all but
impossible to untangle the genetic steps that made it that way,
Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But by working with cancer cells whose genetic changes are well
defined, scientists can begin to ask questions about genes they
find in tumors that they remove from patients, allowing them to add
genes and take them away to learn what the genes do. ``We can ask,
`What are the rules?''' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The current discovery has its origins in another seminal paper,
also published by Weinberg. In 1983, he reported that the addition
of just two mutated genes which had been isolated from cancer cells
can turn normal rat cells into cancer cells in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William C. Hahn, a postdoctoral student in Weinberg's lab,
remembers the excitement. ``It said that cancer was a molecular
event,'' Hahn recalled. Everyone assumed that human cells would be
next. But to scientists' surprise, when they did the same
experiment with human cells it never worked.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald DePinho, a professor at Harvard Medical School and
the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, said that many molecular
biologists took up the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years many investigators have labored very
intensively to get those cells to jump through the appropriate
genetic hoops to form a tumor,'' he said. ``They've thrown the book
at these cells and have been horribly unsuccessful.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists were troubled. They use rodents routinely to study
cancer. They test hypotheses and treatments in rodents and apply
them to human cancer. Why, then, were they able to make normal
rodent cells become cancerous but unable to do the same with human
cells?
</P>
<P>
   The next advance came from a different direction _ the discovery
of a gene for an enzyme, telomerase, that cells use to put caps on
the ends of chromosomes. ``They are like the caps on the end of
shoelaces,'' Hahn explained. ``They protect the ends of the
chromosomes from damage.''
</P>
<P>
   In humans, telomerase is abundant during embryonic and fetal
development, but there is significantly less of the enzyme when
cells mature _ except in most human cancer cells, where it is once
again plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists discovered that if they added telomerase to adult
human cells growing in the laboratory, the cells would divide for
extended periods of time, living much longer than their normal life
span, although they would not turn into cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   They also learned of a crucial difference between mice and
humans: In mice, telomerase is present at high levels in adult
cells as well as in fetal cells. Perhaps, Weinberg and his
colleagues reasoned, if they added telomerase to normal human cells
they could then add cancer genes and create human cancer cells in
the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment worked. They gave the cells two cancer genes:
ras, which pushes cells to grow unrelentingly, and a gene that
codes for the ``large-T oncoprotein,'' which prevents cells from
responding to cellular signals to stop growing. Then they added
telomerase.
</P>
<P>
   All three elements were needed. When they were present, the
cells grew and looked like cancer cells. More important, they
formed tumors when they were transplanted onto mice _ a standard
test to see if cells are cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John D. Minna, the director of the Hamon Center for
Therapeutic Oncology Research at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said he was struck by the
fact that the cancer genes apparently could not act alone but
needed telomerase to change a normal cell into a cancerous one.
</P>
<P>
   That means, he said, that by looking for telomerase, it might be
possible to decide when a benign mass of cells is about to turn
cancerous, aiding in the early detection of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Minna said, he had considered using telomerase as
an early marker for cancer, but had put the idea on hold. ``This
brings it to the front burner,'' he said.

FORBES CAMP DENIES TEMP ALLEGATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican presidential campaign of Steve
Forbes, the multimillionaire magazine publisher, denied Wednesday
it was seeking to pay temporary workers to attend a GOP straw poll
next month in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col was responding to the
allegation made by the Iowa chairman of the Christian Coalition,
who also runs a temp agency in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Gobel told the De Moines Register she was approached by a
Forbes representative in February about hiring workers for a day to
vote for Forbes at the party straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely untrue,'' Dal Col said. ``It's ridiculous on
its face. She shouldn't be spreading these untruths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely will not, have not paid anyone to attend the
straw vote or any other vote,'' Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   The quadrennial straw poll, scheduled Aug. 14 at Iowa State
University in Ames, has sometimes been a relatively accurate
predictor of what's ahead in the early Iowa presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll is a test of candidates' organizational ability
as well as their campaign treasuries. Only Iowa residents with a
$25 ticket will be allowed to vote in the poll, a fund-raising
operation of the Iowa Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Several campaigns, including Forbes' and that of Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, have bought blocks of tickets and are offering them
to Iowans if they will participate in the poll. That raises
questions about whether the straw poll is up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel's accusation came to light as another Republican
presidential candidate, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,
began running television commercials in Iowa suggesting that Bush,
with his record $37 million warchest, is attempting to overwhelm
less well-financed campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just in _ the Iowa caucuses have been canceled,'' a mock
television reporter says in Alexander's advertisement. ``An auction
is under way on the White House lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander appears in the ad to say: ``The presidency ought to be
about raising children, farm prices and standards ... not just
raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's political director, Brian Kennedy, criticized Bush
for relying on a big campaign treasury, but he was muted in his
assessment of Forbes, who has not been reluctant to dip into his
personal fortune to influence the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes has been coming to Iowa, campaigns in Iowa and he
talks about the issues, and that can't be said of all the
candidates,'' said Kennedy, former chairman of the Iowa GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent an estimated $36 million of his own money in his
losing 1996 campaign for the Republican nomination. Even with Dal
Col's denial, the allegation may seem credible to Iowans who have
seen Forbes' lavish political spending.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col questioned the timing of Gobel's accusation, both her
claim that the approach was made in February and her making it
public less than three weeks before the voting.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Dal Col said, ``Who knew if we were even going to
do the straw poll?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the accusation ``muddies the water so nicely.... I
would say there's just some mischief out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least one campaign appearance last week in Iowa, another
candidate, conservative activist Gary Bauer, said one of the
wealthy candidates was hiring temp workers to attend the straw
poll, according to Chris Clayton, an Omaha World-Herald reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Smith, a Bauer spokesman who said he was at the event in
Onawa, Iowa, said Bauer was responding to a question from the
audience. Smith said Bauer did not specify to whom he referred, and
Smith refused Wednesday to clarify the point.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said the allegation had ``been around.'' He refused to
say which campaign was spreading it.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly after hearing of Bauer's allegation, an Iowa Republican
source said, Gobel ``started working the phones'' to get out her
version.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel did not return a telephone call Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She told the Register that she was approached in February by
Jerry Keen, a Forbes organizer who is former chairman of the
Christian Coalition in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely told them no,'' Gobel told the Register. ``It's
deceptive, and I'm not here to deceive the people of Iowa. I'm here
to do God's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' campaign secured a statement from the national Christian
Coalition headquarters in which Gobel appeared to back off from her
accusation, the Register said.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel told the Register she did not write the statement and
said: ``I was told to go along with it, and I don't want to go
along with it. I'd rather burn a bridge than burn my country.''

 &HT;    CARE staffer recalls group's efforts
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mike Godfrey has seen many of the world's most
troubled spots in the 17 years since he joined the staff of CARE.
</P>
<P>
   But after his first visit to Kosovo, he was convinced that the
job ahead for CARE and other humanitarian organizations there is
going to be a tough one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't prepared for the level of destruction,'' said
Godfrey, 46, Wednesday as he described the trip he had just taken
in his new role as Balkans coordinator and deputy director of the
emergency group for Atlanta-based CARE USA.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that destruction is physical _ damaged homes, land-mined
fields, and neighborhoods and homes still going up in smoke in
retaliatory attacks _ but Godfrey said the destruction of the
social fabric struck him as even more bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled visiting Homestead, Fla., after Hurricane Andrew.
The houses were in splinters ``but the sense of community was
there,'' he said. Particularly in the Kosovo city of Mitrovica,
where tensions remain intense, he found little evidence of ``that
sense of community I thought would help with reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   CARE, nonetheless, has begun relief efforts, including
distributing blankets, bedding and hygienic supplies, to all
sectors of Mitrovica's society, including Serbs, ethnic Albanians
and Roma, or Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Kosovo, CARE staffers are also hard at work on
programs ranging from providing shelter to clearing landmines to
finding sources of fuel for the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very depressing to see what was wrought and what
continues to be,'' said Godfrey, who served as CARE's director in
Guatemala before moving to the Atlanta headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge need,'' he said, adding that he hopes the world
has the will to help. Godfrey, meanwhile, is already planning a
return trip to the region later this month.

 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long before she started working on an unfamiliar new
computer that gave her migraine headaches and long before she
learned she had cancer, Jini Fiennes conceived of her sixth and
most ambitious novel, ``Blood Ties,'' a cyclical tale of wounded
generations and the redeeming power of love.
</P>
<P>
   Writing again after years of struggle alongside her husband to
raise seven children on little money in England and Ireland, she
finished the book in 1989 and then absorbed rejection after
rejection from publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost six years after her death, ``Blood Ties,'' written
under her maiden name, Jennifer Lash, has been published to growing
notice, thanks to the efforts of some of her children and their
considerable star power. They include the actors Ralph and Joseph
Fiennes, who with their sister Sophie, a documentary filmmaker and
producer, flew to New York this week from London for interviews and
public readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had an urgency to realize this book,'' said Ralph
(pronounced Rafe, the English way) Fiennes, 36, as the three sat in
the lobby of their Soho hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they said, she never shortchanged them for her own work.
``She never did, my God!'' said Sophie Fiennes. ``I mean, no way!
She was totally 100 percent there. It was us feeling kind of _ ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty,'' Ralph Fiennes finished her sentence. ``For taking
time away from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Jini Fiennes died of breast cancer at 55 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   It was during Fiennes' filming of the 1996 movie ``The English
Patient'' that he spoke of his mother and the book to Michael
Ondaatje, author of the novel on which that movie was based. He in
turn referred ``Blood Ties'' to an editor at Bloomsbury Publishing,
Liz Calder, who was moved by the book _ she said that at the end
``I literally burst into tears'' _ and secured its publication in
1997 in England and last year in the United States. Last year
Bloomsbury also republished an out-of-print book Mrs. Fiennes had
completed in 1990, ``On Pilgrimage,'' a lighthearted account of a
trip among cure seekers to shrines in France and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts redeemed a debt of love, suggested Joseph Fiennes,
29. ``She had a high-octane kind of need to realize her work so of
course she had a lot of frustration,'' he said. Although she had
published five earlier novels, they were not commercially
successful.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Blood Ties'' seems to have been published and reviewed
on its merits, Sophie Fiennes, 32, said they knew their celebrity
was a factor in boosting interest in it. ``We're no fools, we
understand why there's a visibility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, they and their four siblings, who also live in
England _ Martha, a film director; Magnus, a composer; Jacob, a
gamekeeper (and Joseph's twin brother) and Michael Emery, an
archaeologist whom the family took in as an 11-year-old foster
child _ joined their father, Mark, a photographer, in collaborating
on a BBC documentary on their mother and her writing and painting;
it was broadcast in the United States on the Bravo cable network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood Ties'' tells the story of a gentrifed Irish couple,
Violet and Cecil Farr, living desiccated lives and so deeply
indifferent to each other that they barely know how they managed to
conceive a son. The boy, Lumsden, unloved and ridiculed, grows into
a crass and self-centered scoundrel who seduces a barmaid and
abandons her and their son, Spencer. A caring friend then dumps the
neglected child on Violet and Cecil's doorstep for his grandparents
to raise. No better able to love him than their own son, they cast
him out into a hostile world where, against all odds, he conquers
his demons and, with the fathering of yet another generation and
the sacrifice of his life, restores the family's humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers called ``Blood Ties'' harrowing, demanding, stark and
poetic, while at times dense and overwritten. ``A vivid,
frightening story of cyclical neglect,'' The Wall Street Journal
said. Publishers Weekly called ``On Pilgrimage'' a ``luminous
record of the solitary journey she undertook.''
</P>
<P>
   While not autobiography or veiled memoir, ``Blood Ties''
indisputably grew out of Mrs. Fiennes' own unhappy childhood. A
daughter of the Raj culture _ her father, Hal Lash, was a British
officer in India through World War II and her mother, Joan, was a
glamorous, distant presence _ she was consigned to the care of
nannies. After the war the family returned to a grim existence in
England, where she attended a convent school and, in ways the
family later shied away from detailing, was molested by her father.
``We say he abused his authority as a parent,'' Sophie Fiennes
said. ``We really don't want to make a big deal of it because it
runs the danger of hijacking the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She attended art school but, as she later wrote in a brief
autobiographical sketch: ``For fairly chaotic family reasons I was
unable to continue and subsequently lived alone in London, where I
did a variety of singularly menial jobs and had a variety of
so-called nervous breakdowns.'' After undergoing psychoanalysis,
she produced her first novel, ``The Burial,'' in 1961. She
published a second novel, ``The Climate of Belief,'' the following
year and then married.
</P>
<P>
   Her writing all but ceased as she and Mark had six children in
rapid succession, starting with Ralph in 1962 and ending with
Joseph and his twin, Jacob, in 1970. When Ralph was 2, they took in
Michael after seeing a newspaper notice appealing for a foster home
for ``a very disturbed child'' in desperate need of ``somewhere
where he can read a book.''
</P>
<P>
   They moved to Ireland and back, relocating 15 times in as many
years as the family struggled financially. Mrs. Fiennes went back
to writing and painting as the children grew. She published three
more novels, ``Get Down There and Die'' in 1977, ``The Dust
Collector'' in 1979 and ``From May to October'' in 1980. But,
Sophie Fiennes said, as time passed, ``she found it difficult to
navigate her way back into the publishing world.''
</P>
<P>
   A serial reading by Sophie, Ralph and Joseph from ``Blood Ties''
and ``On Pilgrimage'' on Tuesday night at New School University in
Greenwich Village quickly filled all 540 seats, shutting out more
than a hundred other fans clamoring for a live encounter with the
Ralph Fiennes of Broadway's ``Hamlet'' and such popular films as
``The English Patient,'' ``Oscar and Lucinda,'' ``Schindler's
List'' and ``Quiz Show,'' and the Joseph Fiennes of ``Shakespeare
in Love, ``Elizabeth'' and ``Stealing Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   After the readings, which were delivered with dramatic intensity
and drew eruptions of applause, the Fienneses signed copies of the
books, which were sold at the reading, and answered questions.
</P>
<P>
   Someone wanted to know if Sophie, as a director, had considered
turning ``On Pilgrimage'' into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but it has to cook a little,'' she said. ``I'm not sure
how to translate her particular voice to the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Fiennes turned away a question about his forthcoming
movie, ``Eugene Onegin,'' being directed by his sister Martha.
``We're here just to talk about books,'' he said with a pained
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Someone else asked whether having a creative mother made it
easier or harder to develop their own creative paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her passion for her children's development was very strong,''
Ralph Fiennes said. ``It was hard for her to know how to divide her
time between her children and her own writing. But she was
unstinting in her commitment to us to find a way for us to create
whatever we had to create.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it feel to be publicly reading their mother's work?
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard her voice, reading it aloud,'' said Joseph Fiennes.

BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET SURPLUS LOOMS AS MAJOR ISSUE FOR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 1)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a presidential election, the party that defines
the agenda for debate is the one that usually wins.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Democrats and Republicans are battling so hard over
how to divvy up the first federal budget surplus in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats would like the public to focus on their plan to
use the lion's share of the surplus to shore up Social Security,
Medicare, education and the environment and pay down the national
debt _ and then grant a modest cut in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans want the emphasis on their $792 billion tax
reduction over 10 years. They claim the surplus will be large
enough to accommodate such a tax cut as well as provide money for
vital programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have reverted to a political strategy that
proved successful in the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, and the
Democrats have resurrected a policy that has served them well since
the days of the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made it clear he will veto the GOP tax
cut, and Republicans are prepared to attack the veto, assuming that
voters will not understand why, with such a big surplus, they
cannot have a reprieve from high taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats contend that the huge GOP cut would not permit the
government to fund essential programs and pay down the national
debt. Clinton has termed it ``irresponsible,'' warning that it
could prove dangerous to the economic stability of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting future gyrations of the national economy is a
dangerous game. There is no guarantee that the budget will be
balanced and surpluses will accrue far into the future. If the
economy were to fall into recession, the government would have to
exchange black ink for red ink or reduce the size of the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer of Texas
said last week, ``All American taxpayers created this surplus, and
it's only fair to return it to those who sent it here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious, therefore, that the tax cut battle of this summer
will spill over into 2000 unless the two parties can reach a
compromise that Clinton will sign.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, look for the Republicans to label Clinton and the
Democratic presidential nominee, whether he is Al Gore or Bill
Bradley, as big-spending liberals.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats, as they're doing now, will point out that the
biggest beneficiaries of the GOP tax plan would be special
interests and wealthy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The one certainty is that a vast amount of hyperbole will
pollute the political atmosphere between now and Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in 1992. Clinton defeated President George Bush
largely because he and his fellow Democrats repeatedly blamed Bush
and the Republicans for the recession then plaguing the economy.
The winning campaign theme was: ``It's the economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years earlier, Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis asserted that the campaign would be about competence not
ideology. But Bush and his handlers rejected that contention,
claiming that Dukakis was a fuzzy, big-spending liberal who was
soft on crime.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to a convict named Willie Horton, who had attacked
a Maryland couple while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison
during Dukakis' governorship. Dukakis helplessly watched his
substantial lead in the public opinion polls dwindle to a deficit.
On Election Day Bush garnered nearly 9 million more votes that
Dukakis and carried 40 of the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   But if Republicans believe they can duplicate Reagan's 1980
triumph in 2000, they may be wrong. Circumstances have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's opponent, Jimmy Carter, was unpopular. Interest rates
and inflation were in the double-digits. Gasoline was expensive and
hard to get. American hostages had been held in Iran for a year.
</P>
<P>
   When Reagan, in a televised debate with Carter, asked Americans
whether they were better off than they had been four years earlier,
their answer was clear and decisive: They were not.
</P>
<P>
   On that Election Day, Reagan won 44 states to six for Carter.
What often is forgotten, however, is that the Reagan
across-the-board tax cut, which injected life into a stagnant
economy, also sent the national debt rocketing to unprecedented
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the economy is strong. Interest rates are down. Inflation
and joblessness are almost nonexistent and gasoline is plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   The debate next year could parallel that of 19 years ago, but a
whole new generation with different priorities will be voting.

   KINSHASA, Congo _ One of the strangest subplots in the war in
Congo, a conflict of innumerable betrayals and head-spinning
surprises, has been the very public disintegration of one of the
country's richest families, the Bembas.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Saolona Bemba, is a minister in the Kinshasa
government. The son, Jean-Pierre, is leading a rebel force in the
jungles of northern Congo whose aim is to march upon the capital
here and overthrow its government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a message from Papa: He should really think hard about
what he is doing,'' the father, 60, said in a recent television
interview. ``All I'm asking for is that nothing happens to him and
that he can resume his old life and take care of his family, his
little family, his wife and children. Let him come home and follow
what his Papa and President Kabila are busy doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The son, 39, reached on his satellite phone on the northern
battlefront, sounded a little testy upon hearing of his father's
plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a kid anymore. I can fly on my own wings,'' the son
said, juggling two satellite phones, barking military orders into
the other one, judging from the French words sprinkled in with the
local Lingala: ``fuel,'' ``recruits,'' ``ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   Betrayal, if there is one leitmotif to this war, runs through
it. But few would have predicted the spectacle of so famous a
father and son accusing each other of betrayal, two men who had
defied this country's political gravity for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The father was a businessman who became one of the nation's
richest men through his close ties with former President Mobutu
Sese Seko. The elder Bemba, a legendary survivor who married off a
daughter to one of Mobutu's sons even as he himself married a niece
of Mobutu's main political rival, was beaten and jailed after the
late dictator's fall two years ago. Curtains for Bemba, people here
thought.
</P>
<P>
   His son emerged from the father's shadow a few months after war
erupted across Congo last August. Sketchy reports began filtering
out of the impassable jungles in northern Congo. A second, shadowy
rebel movement was stirring up there, and towns were falling in its
path.
</P>
<P>
   Once this movement's satellite phone numbers began circulating,
the name of its leader became known: Bemba. That is to say,
Jean-Pierre Bemba, oldest son of Saolona, a lifelong civilian, who,
it became clear, was bent on toppling President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   But the old man, written off prematurely, it turned out, chose
an equally unexpected path. He ingratiated himself with Kabila _ no
small feat since Kabila had spent half of his life hidden in a
jungle dreaming of the day he would depose Mobutu and his class _
to the point that Kabila made him his minister of economy and
industry early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Theories flew across Kinshasa. Increasingly desperate, Kabila
had made the father a minister to put pressure on his son to
abandon arms. Or, the Bembas were in on it together: whoever won
this war, the family would win.
</P>
<P>
   The father, naturally, played up the former recently in a
Kinshasa television show called ``With Open Heart.'' Asked whether
he felt betrayed by his son, the father _ who had publicly disowned
Jean-Pierre late last year _ said: ``Of course. He may have his
ideals. But he's wrong, like many young people, incidentally.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Punctuating the father's plea, a recent issue of the
pro-government daily, Le Palmares, published the son's picture on
the front page with the caption: ``J.P. Bemba: le reve d'Icare?''
or ``The dream of Icarus?''
</P>
<P>
   So is Jean-Pierre a reckless son, doomed because of his stubborn
refusal to listen to wise Daedalus? Or, to take a contemporary
myth, is he Luke Skywalker trying to redeem a father who chose the
dark side?
</P>
<P>
   The son said he had given up a millionaire's life in exile in
Europe, where his wife and children were now, to risk his neck in
the bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has chosen to serve the devil and I have chosen to serve
the people,'' the son said, adding: ``Besides, I was disowned in
October, so I don't know what son he's talking about. He had me
when he was 20 years old and he disowned me a year ago. Am I hurt?
What I am doing here is bigger than all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jean-Pierre Bemba, if the decision to head a rebellion was a
surprising one, it was not incomprehensible. As the son of a Mobutu
crony, he belonged to the small circle of children of the Congolese
elite, an entitled class that could do practically anything with
impunity. Almost overnight, its members saw their fathers jailed by
Kabila, their fortunes seized and, more important, their once
limitless future here at a dead-end.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Olivier Kamitatu, 35, recently abandoned his highly
respected public opinion research company, whose reports were
scrutinized by Western diplomats, to become Jean-Pierre Bemba's
secretary-general. Kamitatu was schooled in Europe, like most
members in this circle, said his father, Massamba Kamitatu, 68, a
former minister and ambassador to Japan under Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my son,'' said Kamitatu, who was now living in his
daughter's small apartment, his house confiscated after Mobutu's
fall. ``He's an adult. He's made the political decision of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   No such words of understanding from Bemba pere, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to me to go to him,'' the father said, and
alluding to African societies where the paternal authority is
almost never questioned, added: ``I am an African. He must come to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let my son come back home,'' he added. ``The family needs him.
Every father needs to see his children. I need him. I raised him to
replace me.''
</P>
<P>
   The son, at first distracted by his other phone call, grew
hungry for details about his father's television interview. He
laughed. ``It's a little pathetic. It's funny. He must have made
people laugh in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never particularly close to my former father anyway,''
added the younger Bemba, whose mother died when he was 12. ``I was
very close to Maman. I miss her a lot. You know, I'm a boy and boys
are always closer to their mothers.''

 &HT;    SEC Notebook: Spurrier spices up SEC meetings
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM _ As usual, Steve Spurrier added a little spice to an
otherwise business-as-usual day at the annual Southeastern
Conference football kickoff meetings Tuesday. ``We played lousy,
and we were still 10-2 last year,'' the Florida coach said. ``I
think you ought to check out all those teams we beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans were getting a little restless,'' Spurrier said. ``We
had Auburn down 24-3 and were trying to run out the clock, and they
booed us. Can you imagine being up on Auburn 24-3 and that wasn't
enough?''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Gator was asked about the SEC's Eastern Division
this year. ``All you've got to do is look at the history over the
past nine years. I don't see much changing.'' Florida has put up a
93-18-1 overall record during Spurrier's nine-years in Gainesville
and posted a 66-9 SEC mark while winning five SEC titles.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier was told that Tennessee coach Philip Fulmer had
commented that it was harder to win the SEC East than it was to win
a national championship. ``He doesn't have to play Florida State
the last game of the season every year,'' Spurrier quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer also had said a day earlier that his relationship with
Spurrier was better than most people thought. ``It probably is,''
Spurrier said. ``It's about like I have with all the other
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier is a longtime and outspoken advocate of a playoff
system and again said he felt the best scenario was to have a
16-team playoff, with the teams being chosen by a committee, much
as college basketball does it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they don't ask my opinion about it,'' he said. ``They hear
it a lot, but they don't ask for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Get moving fast
</P>
<P>
   Gator wide receiver Travis Taylor, Florida's most experienced
returning pass-catcher, said he is anxious for the season to begin.
``I think on our team there's a sense of urgency,'' Taylor said.
``We feel we need to get back to what we had in 1996,'' when
Florida won a national title. Taylor, a junior, was asked what team
he pulled for in last year's national championship game between
in-state rival FSU and SEC rival Tennessee. ``If they both could
have lost, that's what I would have liked to have seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Low profile
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Tuberville, who jumped from Mississippi to Auburn, says
he's taken a different approach. ``When I first got to Ole Miss, I
was trying to get my name in the paper,'' he said. ``Now at Auburn,
I've just been trying to keep my name out of the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss offensive lineman Todd Wade says the '98 Rebel team was
unique. ``I was surprised how well we played in our bowl game,'' he
said, referring to Mississippi's win over Texas Tech in the
Independence Bowl. ``I think our fans were too. They didn't expect
us to win after the coaching change and we lost our last three
games of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't take it
</P>
<P>
   Former Tennessee offensive coordinator and new Ole Miss head
coach David Cutcliffe says he watched his former Vols beat Florida
State in the national championship game on television in Oxford,
Miss. ``I watched the first half by myself, and then I called up
former player Jerry Colquitt at halftime. I told him, 'Jerry, come
over here and watch this game with me before I hurt myself or break
something.' I felt like I was levitating over the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar name
</P>
<P>
   Cutcliffe recruited Eli Manning, the younger brother of former
UT All-American Peyton Manning, to play quarterback at Ole Miss.
``In a perfect world, you'd try to redshirt him, but I'm not sure
we can,'' Cutcliffe said. ``Physically, he's a lot like Peyton.
They throw with the same type motion. He may be a little further
along physically by all the time he's spent in the weight room.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, ALLIES TO SEEK STABILITY, INCLUSIVENESS FOR WAR-TORN
BALKANS AT SUMMIT
 &HT;    700&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    EDs: President Clinton is scheduled to land at Aviano Air Base
in Italy Thursday night. He will leave there on a military aircraft
for Sarajevo Friday morning.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton leaves Thursday to lead an
international conference on Balkans renewal in Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital that gave most of the world its first glimpse of
the ethnic-based horror at the heart of Europe's worst fighting
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The day-long conference Friday comes on the heels of an
international donors' conference Wednesday in Brussels, where more
than 60 nations pledged a total of $2.1 billion in immediate
reconstruction aid for war-shattered Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States pledged $500 million, U.S. diplomat James
Dobbins told reporters in Brussels. Japan put up $200 million,
Germany pledged $190 billion and Britain promised $145 million, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after NATO bombing ended the latest chapter in nearly
a decade of Balkans bloodshed, Clinton will lead his counterparts
from three dozen other nations -- including most of Europe and
Russia -- in a summit he hopes will help advance his vision of
rebuilding Kosovo and helping to knit the rest of the war-tattered
region back into the fabric of central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the conference is slated to launch a blueprint for
that plan, the Balkan Stability Pact, agreed upon earlier this year
by U.S. and European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has three main objectives: advancing political and economic
reforms in Southeast Europe; promoting cooperation, tolerance and
security there; and working ultimately to integrate the region into
the European mainstream,'' Clinton's national security adviser,
Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger, told reporters at the White House on
Wednesday. `` We have a really historic opportunity, after Kosovo,
to bring these nations into Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Notably absent will be Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president
of Yugoslavia, who has been indicted for war crimes against ethnic
Albanians in the Serb province of Kosovo. Friday's summit will
underscore the impact of the decision by Clinton and his allies not
to provide reconstruction aid to Serbia -- the main republic in
Yugoslavia -- so long as Milosevic remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   The message to the Serb people, ``will be simple,'' said Berger.
`` With Milosevic, you are excluded from the Stability Pact and
isolated from the rest of Europe. With a government
</P>
<P>
   committed to democratic reform and international cooperation, we
are prepared to help bring Serbia into the European mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders will gather in the Olympic arena where figure skater
Katerina Witt, competing for what was then East Germany, captured
her gold medal in 1984. Shelled to ruin by Serb gunners just a
decade later, the largely reconstructed venue will provide a
powerful backdrop for international efforts to help salvage a
region ravaged by war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a symbol of Sarajevo and its multi-ethnic and
international character,'' said Craig Buck, the Sarajevo mission
director for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).
``It's a symbol of Bosnia's regeneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarajevo, however, is also replete with symptoms of failure in a
country where some 6,200 U.S. troops are deployed as part of a
larger NATO force of 29,000, and Americans have spent well over $6
billion during the past four years in peacekeeping and
reconstruction efforts that are nowhere near complete.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton and other alliance leaders meet to map out the road
ahead for neighboring Kosovo and the region at large, many Balkans
analysts are hoping the leaders will learn some lessons from the
Bosnia experience, and not simply repeat past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symbolism of Sarajevo can cut both ways,'' said Kurt
Bassuener, associate director of the Balkan Action Council, a
Washington, D.C. research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no war in Bosnia now,'' he said. ``But the fact that
there's no end in sight for the U.S. troops deployed there, because
we haven't dealt with the fundamental issues of Bosnia, that is not
a model of what we want the region to look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other critics, Bassuener said the United States and its
allies have largely squandered the opportunity to remake Bosnia
during nearly four years of NATO peacekeeping operations, and he
hopes Clinton and his counterparts will take notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in a holding pattern for four years, with very
little real progress,'' Bassuener said. ``Every delegate who
actually gets out of his chauffeured car on the way to the
convention will hopefully see that.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself is well aware of the failings in Bosnia. In a
report to Congress this week, he named several of them, including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  its de facto partition along ethnic lines;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the slow progress in building the foundations for a civil
society governed by a functioning democracy;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the continuing impediments to replacing a state-centered
economy with market-driven, private companies;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  NATO's failure to turn over indicted war criminals like
Radovan Karadic and Ratko Mladic, respectively, the political and
military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs, to the U.N. tribunal on war
crimes in the former Yugoslavia;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and, most fundamentally, the inability of some 1.2 million
Bosnians displaced by fighting and ethnic terror to return to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge before Clinton, who has invested more heavily of
his time and foreign policy resources in the Balkans than anyone
might possibly have imagined when he first took office six and a
half years ago, is how to maintain the focus on Bosnia while trying
to rebuild neighboring Kosovo and reaching out to the rest of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, which priced Bosnia's short-term rebuilding
needs at $5.1 billion over four years, has estimated Kosovo's
immediate needs at roughly one-fourth that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Longer-term needs, though, could well top $10 billion for the
Balkans, Europe's poorest region, with 47 million people producing
$82 billion worth of goods and services per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having won the war, we must win the peace,'' said Gene
Sperling, director of Clinton's National Economic Council. ``And
winning the peace means, not only the immediate humanitarian side
for Kosovo, and even the longer-term reconstruction of Kosovo, but
also working on an economically viable vision for Southeastern
Europe as a whole.''

NASA INSPECTORS FIND SOURCE OF HYDROGEN FUEL LEAK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ With the shuttle Columbia safely back on
Earth, NASA quickly found the holes Wednesday that allowed hydrogen
fuel to leak from a rocket engine nozzle, threatening the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Initial inspections of the nozzle found holes in at least two
and perhaps four stainless steel tubes that circulate hydrogen
through the nozzle on its way to the engine's combustion chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The leak, as well as an electrical short circuit, threatened the
shuttle's July 22 climb into orbit with five astronauts and the
Chandra X-ray observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing both problems as significant, agency officials
said they would work aggressively to find the causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we have a problem,'' said NASA administrator Dan
Goldin, who greeted Columbia commander Eileen Collins, pilot Jeff
Ashby, flight engineer Steve Hawley, mission specialist Catherine
``Cady'' Coleman and French astronaut Michel Tognini as they landed
at NASA's Kennedy Space Center late Tuesday. ``We will diagnose it,
find out what went wrong and fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Had either problem worsened, Columbia's three main rocket
engines would have shutdown prematurely, forcing the shuttle
astronauts to attempt an unprecedented emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let down. We've got to make sure we understand these
failures, get them resolved before we fly again,'' said Bill
Gerstenmair, NASA's shuttle planning manager. ``We will do that
with both of these failures.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA's next shuttle mission is tentatively planned for
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Columbia returned from its five-day flight, engineers
zeroed in on the damage to the narrow cooling tubes within the
nozzle of the shuttle's right main rocket engine.
</P>
<P>
   The perforations explained an unusual bright streak coming from
the nozzle that shuttle engineers spotted when they studied
photographs taken as it launched. Space agency experts made the
photographs public last Sunday, saying the irregularity suggested a
small leak of explosive hydrogen.

   Collins joined her crewmates and shuttle program managers in a
runway inspection of Columbia after their return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what appeared to be three small holes, not straight down
the tubes, but in a little bit of a diagonal pattern,'' Collins
told reporters. The nozzles for the three main engines each have
1,080 tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstenmair said the cooling tubes will be inspected this week
with for signs of a perforation from a debris strike, corrosion or
structural failure. Then the damaged portions of the tubes will be
removed, cut into sections and analyzed for further indications of
how and when the damage occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Though small in quantity, the fuel loss triggered the shuttle's
engines to consume liquid oxygen at a higher than normal rate to
maintain thrust during Columbia's 8 1/2-minute ride to orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers will attempt to trace the electrical short to either
the shuttle's wiring or the computerlike controller on the
Columbia's center rocket engine. During the launch, the short
disrupted the primary controllers on the right as well as the
center engine. Had backup controllers not taken over, the engines
would have shut down prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mission's rocky start, Columbia's crew successfully
deployed the shuttle's primary payload, the Chandra X-ray
Observatory, a new space telescope developed to help astronomers
determine the size and age of the universe as well as how the stars
and galaxies evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, NASA's first female shuttle commander, drew praise for
guiding her colleagues through the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eileen Collins represents the best of this country,'' said
Goldin. ``She was cool and calm and handled the problems. She did a
terrific job just like all of our other commanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said her crew handled the potential emergencies just as
they had trained to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that we definitely need to take a very close, hard look
at what happened,'' she said. ``We don't want that to happen again
on a future mission.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials greeted Collins on the runway following touchdown
along with her husband and 31/2-year-old daughter, Bridget.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 500 to 600 people met her on her return to Houston,
including many little girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has not only equaled but surpassed Amelia Earhart in the
history of flight,'' said Vice President Al Gore, who attended the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Houston, Collins described how she felt when
the warning lights flashed moments after liftoff. ``This isn't
right. This isn't what I'm expecting,'' she thought to herself. But
she and the crew had trained for multiple failures during launch
and knew what responses would be required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just amazed that I don't think my stress level was any
different, other than I heard the call and I went, `Wow, I'm
surprised that happened,''' she said.

THE CHARITY BEAT GOES ON WITH NEW BENEFIT DISCS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing no one ever really expected a rock star to do: give
money to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1971, George Harrison became one of the first immensely
popular rockers to do so. Embracing the pleas of his friend/musical
inspiration Ravi Shankar, the famed Indian sitar player, Harrison
organized the Concert for Bangladesh to aid victims of war and
famine in that country. The concert, which featured Harrison, Eric
Clapton, Bob Dylan and others, was recorded and later released as a
three-disc set, again with proceeds going to a Bangladesh fund.
</P>
<P>
   After that, rock 'n' roll became a lot better about opening its
heart and wallet. Harrison undoubtedly paved the way for the
monster Live Aid famine relief concert in 1985, the yearly Farm Aid
festivals and the countless benefit discs that flood the market
every year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, three more benefit discs have been organized,
with at least four more to follow this year, including one for
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Although some recent benefit discs have been plagued with old
material, or just plain bad songs, the three new ones contain new
tracks, interesting duets or once-rare B-sides. Filler, this
stuff's not.
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees''
(Epic Records)
</P>
<P>
   The cause: Humanitarian relief for Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The music: Mostly alt-rock.
</P>
<P>
   Contributors: Pearl Jam, Oasis, Rage Against the Machine, Neil
Young, Alanis Morissette, Korn, Black Sabbath, Bush, Ben Folds
Five, Sarah McLachlan, Indigo Girls, the Wallflowers, Jamiroquai,
Tori Amos and Peter Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   Unreleased material?: Some, but most of what's here is live, a
remix or a B-side. Amos, The Wallflowers and Ben Folds Five offer
new tracks. And this is the only way to get Pearl Jam's new song, a
cover of Texan J. Frank Wilson's 1964 hit, ``Last Kiss,'' about a
couple's final moments together after a fatal car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights: ``Last Kiss,'' definitely; a live version of Neil
Young's ``War of Man:'' Rage's metallic reworking of Bruce
Springsteen's ``The Ghost of Tom Joad:'' and an interesting remix
of Korn's ``Freak on a Leash,'' retweaked by Garbage drummer Butch
Vig.
</P>
<P>
   Available: Now.
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``Music for Our Mother Ocean 3'' (Surfdog/Hollywood
Records)
</P>
<P>
   The cause: The Surfrider Foundation, a California-based
organization devoted to preserving the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   The music: Good mix of pop, adult contemporary and hard rock
artists doing surf-rock-tinged music. Most tracks have some sort of
summer/sun/let's-go-surfing theme.
</P>
<P>
   Contributors: Brian Setzer with Brian Wilson, Snoop Dogg and
Rage Against the Machine, Smash Mouth, Sprung Monkey, B---hole
Surfers, Beck, Lisa Loeb, Jane's Addiction, Pearl Jam, Allison
Moorer, Paul McCartney and Wings, Gary Hoey, Jimmy Buffett, Red Hot
Chili Peppers, Everclear, Ben Harper, James Taylor, Beastie Boys,
Lit, Chris Isaak.
</P>
<P>
   Unreleased material?: Plenty, including a ton of covers, such as
Setzer and Wilson's duet on the Beach Boys classic, ``Little Deuce
Coup,'' the Surfers' thrashing of The Lovin' Spoonful's ``Summer in
the City'' and Everclear's run-through of an old Ventures
instrumental, ``Walk, Don't Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights: All the covers are great, as is a new song by the
Chili Peppers, ``How Strong,'' Snoop Dogg and Rage's duet, ``Snoop
Bounce'' and Jane's Addiction's ``Ocean Size.''
</P>
<P>
   Available: Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The disc: ``More Oar _ A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album''
(Birdman Records)
</P>
<P>
   The cause: To help pay medical bills and other expenses for Moby
Grape singer Alexander ``Skip'' Spence, a schizophrenic who died in
April. In 1969, Spence released a solo record called Oar, hence the
benefit disc's name.
</P>
<P>
   The music: Experimental rock ranging from well-known acts such
as Beck, Tom Waits and Robert Plant to obscure, underground groups
such as Flying Saucer Attack and Engine 54; each artist covers a
Spence or Moby Grape tune.
</P>
<P>
   Contributors: Robert Plant, Mark Lanegan of Screaming Trees,
Alejandro Escovedo, The Durocs, Jay Farrar of Son Volt, Mudhoney,
Robyn Hitchcock, Diesel Park West, Tom Waits, Greg Dulli of Afghan
Whigs, The Ophelias, Flying Saucer Attack, Alistair Galbraith,
Engine 54, Outrageous Cherry, Beck and the Minus 5.
</P>
<P>
   Unreleased material: Nothing here has been previously released;
all the tracks were recorded exclusively for this disc.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights: Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan does haunting
justice to ``Cripple Creek,'' turning it into a sad, acoustic
ballad. English ambient troupe Flying Saucer Attack offers a
spacey, mesmerizing ``Grey-Afro.'' And Texan Alejandro Escovedo
adds a melancholy blues-rock vibe to ``Diana.'' Actually, the
atmosphere of the entire record is dismal, and seems even more so
now that Spence has died.

 &HT;    COKE: Suspect business practices or 'piling on'?
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola's overseas problems expanded Wednesday when
Australian regulators said they were investigating the company's
largest bottler in the Asia Pacific region for possible abuses of
its market power.
</P>
<P>
   The move came just a week after European Union officials said
they were launching an inquiry into whether Coca-Cola bottlers
there were giving illegal incentives to retailers to sell their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Goldman, a global beverage analyst for Merrill Lynch, said
the inquiries, on top of the overseas regulatory problems the
company has faced in trying to buy Cadbury Schweppes' brands, may
be the result of piling on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person is perceived to be down, you kick him, and we
may be seeing some of this now,'' Goldman said. ``Why is all this
happening now in Europe and Australia,'' Goldman asked
rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs agreed, saying ``there's no
doubt'' that some piling on is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Cohen said issues like this begin to
arise when a company becomes so dominant in individual markets.
</P>
<P>
   And Goldman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke and Pepsi are of comparable strengths in U.S.
supermarkets,'' Goldman said. ``But in Australia and Europe, Coke
is in a class by itself from a market share standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pepsico acknowledged last week that its complaints were
partly responsible for the EU probe of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Australian regulators said they began investigating the bottler
Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. after receiving recent complaints about its
sales practices. Those complaints were lodged while the regulators
from the Australian Competition Commission were evaluating whether
Coca-Cola should be allowed to purchase Cadbury Schweppes' brands
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has twice rejected Coca-Cola's effort to buy
those brands, including Sunkist and Schweppes, on anti-competitive
grounds. It is now looking into Coca-Cola Amatil's sales agreements
with Australian retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at a very early stage,'' said Lin Enright, a spokeswowan
for the competition commission. ``We haven't even established if
there is a breach'' of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Amatil said it believes its marketing practices comply
with the law. The Sydney-based bottler is 43 percent owned by
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola. But that stake is expected to fall to 37
percent after Coca-Cola completes a deal to acquire a majority
stake in F&AMP;N Cola of Singapore, a major bottler in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, EU authorities last week seized documents from
Coca-Cola and bottlers in the United Kingdom, Austria, Denmark and
Germany. They are investigating whether the Coca-Cola system
offered rebates and other financial incentives to retailers that
offer a wide range of Coke products while removing rivals' drinks
from store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Cohen described the EU investigation as an ``annoying
complication'' for Coca-Cola at a time when it is in the process of
rebuilding its image after a recall of its products in Belgium,
France and several other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The EU probe comes only two months after Coca-Cola decided to
eliminate 20 European nations from its Cadbury purchase because of
antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which excludes the United States, is expected to close
in about 160 nations soon. Some analysts predict later this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement would not be consummated in three key markets
_ Australia, Mexico and Canada _ because the companies still need
regulatory approval. Mexican regulators have rejected the deal
once, although the companies are still trying to work it out with
them. Canadian regulators have not yet ruled on the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, in South Africa, Coca-Cola is negotiating to
purchase Cadbury's brands. Regulators there already have said they
would approve such a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's shares fell $1.12 1/2 Wednesday, closing at $61.37
1/2.

SEEMS ROSS IS NOT THE BOSS THESE DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you like that? Ross Perot creates a political party to
feed his insatiable appetite for notoriety and power _ and now the
party won't so much as toss him a crumb.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party wouldn't even go along with Perot's choice for
chairman during its weekend convention in Michigan. Seems Ross the
Boss isn't the boss anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Which should surprise exactly no one. When you've heard Perot's
shtick once, you've heard it a thousand times. Who needs to hear it
again?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the bottom line, as Ross would say: The wheels came off
the Perot bandwagon long ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that simple.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens to the Reform Party now?
</P>
<P>
   Early converts to Perot's ``grassroots'' organization deluded
themselves into believing that they had some relevance separate
from Perot's monumental ego. But they were puppets, dancing to the
founder's tune even as he proclaimed himself to be the humble
servant of his ``volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that the volunteers have finally figured out
that Perot is a self-serving phony whose short-lived emergence as a
player on the stage of national politics was nothing but a mirage
conjured up by Perot at the expense of a frustrated electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Perot, it must be noted that he evidently retains
a loyal if shrinking army of Perotistas who would still march into
fire if he gave the order. ``USA Today'' reported that more than 22
percent of delegates participating in a convention straw poll named
Perot as their first choice to be the party's presidential nominee
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But then, winning a poll in which the runner-up was Donald Trump
_ 17.5 percent _ may have been a hollow victory for the original
Scheming Weasel. It certainly won't do much in the way of igniting
another .MDBR/''.MDNM/Perot for President.MDBR/''.MDNM/ movement.
</P>
<P>
   The only person capable of firing up the Reform Party nowadays,
it would seem, is the party's only big-deal officeholder, Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura. Notwithstanding Ventura's eighth-place finish
in the presidential straw poll _ he insists that he won't run for
president _ the former pro wrestler may well be the party's new
puppeteer.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventura-backed candidate won the party
chairmanship.MDBR/,.MDNM/ and Ventura has clearly elbowed Perot out
of the spotlight to position himself as the most vocal and visible
Reformer on the planet. It surely won't be long before Ventura is
babbling about being a humble servant of the volunteers or some
such.
</P>
<P>
   Take this to the bank: If Ventura wants to run for president, he
will set it up to appear that the Reform Party has insisted on it.
He really has no interest in running, he'll say, but he can't turn
his back on the organization that welcomed him with open arms way
back when he was a no-chance candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you suppose these characters always want to create the
illusion that somebody is begging them to run? Why can't they just
tell the truth: ``I'm running for the highest office in the land
because I'm a power-hungry egomaniac and I want to be president so
much I can taste it.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd almost have to vote for a candidate who said that, just
out of gratitude for his honesty.
</P>
<P>
   It's all academic, of course, because the Reform Party was dead
on arrival. The third-party movement peaked early in Perot's first
run for president in 1992, before the third party even existed.
</P>
<P>
   Perot was a one-man show who invented the Reform Party for the
purpose of institutionalizing his presidential ambitions _ and
fostering the deception that his pursuit of high office was about
something other than Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura and others are bravely attempting to salvage the
wreckage .MDBR/that .MDNM/Perot left behind, but they are wasting
their time.
</P>
<P>
   With all its flaws, the two-party system has served this country
well.MDBR/,.MDNM/ and it will continue to do so. American voters
love to complain about it, insult it, threaten it. When all is said
and done, though, we always come back to the system that we know
and understand.
</P>
<P>
   And when all is said and done, the system usually works just
fine.

 &HT;    BellSouth to offer day's headlines, e-mail through phone
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coming soon _ catch the news on your phone.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the opening salvos for what is sure to be a loud and
bitter battle for customers, BellSouth announced Wednesday that it
will offer CNN Mobile reports, as well as e-mail, over its digital
wireless phones later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a portfolio of various information services
that we can offer the customer,'' said Carlton Hill, director of
product development for BellSouth's cellular unit.
</P>
<P>
   Although no pricing has yet been set, plans call for the first
version of the service to be a ``push'' technology in which stories
of up to 160 characters are broadcast to the user and stored on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the service is primarily aimed at two groups: early
adopters who are quick to try new technology and mobile
professionals who expect to stay connected as they travel.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting those expectations, the news-to-the-phone service
will be packaged together with the company's offerings to
``high-end'' customers, who use a lot of wireless minutes and spend
a fair amount of money each month.
</P>
<P>
   Data is almost certainly the next big thing in wireless, a
potentially lucrative game in which competitors will certainly
scramble for a headstart.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers are expected to leap with both feet on the data
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Some have already announced commitments. For example, Sprint in
June announced plans to deliver a range of features from Yahoo, the
Internet powerhouse. By the end of the year, Sprint plans to offer
e-mail, address books and daily feeds of news headlines from Yahoo
News. That includes sports, finance and weather, according to
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   But Nextel and Southern _ which have Motorola technology that
combines two-way radio with cellular phones _ will be one step
ahead _ at least at the start. By late summer, both Nextel and
Southern plan to launch a data service that lets users surf the
Internet _ albeit without the graphics and multimedia options.
</P>
<P>
   That option is superior to just passive reception, said Southern
spokeswoman Stacey Liederman. ``It is one thing to get the
information to your phone, but if you can't do anything with it,
it's just information; it's not interactive.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth plans to add interactive functions in the next
generation of the technology, and other carriers will no doubt do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   That notion fits with the CNN mission, said Mitch Lazar, vice
president of new media for Turner International, a unit of Turner
Broadcasting which produces CNN. ``Our goal has been to provide
news and information to people all over the world on whatever
device they want to use.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN licenses the service, receiving a fee for the reports as
well as the use of its world-known name. CNN's arrangement gives
BellSouth a window of several months during which CNN promises not
to license its service to another carrier. But CNN is virtually
sure to announce other similar arrangements once that window
closes. ``BellSouth is the first, but there are others as well that
we continue to talk to,'' Lazar said.
</P>
<P>
   The company believes the idea of pumping news to phones has
tremendous potential, but needs time _ and as many outlets as
possible, said Lazar. ``We need to seed the market and educate the
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The services are new to U.S. phones, although some paging
customers have been getting news for years. No one knows for sure
how fast the U.S. demand for such services will take off and how
much customers will pay for them. But similar services are offered
in Europe and have grown in popularity, especially among young,
mobile professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are customers that are data-savvy and device-savvy,''
Hill said.

DESPITE NAVAL EXERCISES, CHINA SEEMS TO HAVE A WAIT-AND-SEE
ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A Chinese news service reported Wednesday that the
navy was conducting mobilization exercises along the southern
coast, across from Taiwan. But it appears to be a relatively
moderate operation that hints at little real military preparation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a newspaper ran a front-page photograph of military
helicopters intended to look as though they were preparing for
battle. But the picture was so badly doctored, so obviously fake,
that it had the opposite effect of signaling Beijing's distinctly
halfhearted attitude toward potential conflict with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three weeks after President Lee Teng-hui caused an uproar
by asserting that Taiwan would deal with China only on a ``special
state-to-state'' basis, heightening tension about a possible
military conflict, Chinese officials and Western diplomats say
Beijing is shying away from any action.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beijing's insistence that it would use military force to
block a declaration of independence by Taiwan, which it has
considered a renegade province since the Chinese civil war ended in
1949, the danger of military conflict, it seems clear, is receding.
Editorials in the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily continue
to denounce Lee, but behind the often vociferous warnings, the
overall reaction in Beijing has been restrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has to express its position strongly,'' a senior Chinese
official involved in talks with Taiwan said. ``But there doesn't
seem to be any need for military action this time.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason behind China's relatively reserved response, the
official said, is that Lee is scheduled to be replaced in elections
in March. Because Beijing sees the Taiwan-born Lee as predisposed
against China, it makes sense to wait until his successor takes
office. That is especially the case, because the candidate who is
leading in Taiwan opinion polls, James Soong, favors more cordial
ties with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven months is not such a long time,'' the official said.
``We can wait.''
</P>
<P>
   A second reason is that Beijing recognizes that in the last
Taiwan crisis, in 1996, China's decision to launch missiles near
Taiwan only created sympathy for Lee, achieving the opposite of
what Beijing intended. China's military may have also been
humiliated when the United States sent two carrier battle groups to
the region to show support for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They learned a lesson in '96,'' a Western diplomat in Beijing
said as he referred to China's leaders. ``This time, if they sit
back and do nothing, it's Lee who's getting all the flak.''
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed Lee who has drawn international criticism for
roiling diplomatic waters. When President Clinton spoke out last
week in support for Beijing's position that the Chinese mainland
and Taiwan should continue to be considered a single country, that
effectively drew Washington closer to Beijing and further from
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee Teng-hui is actually bringing China and the U.S. closer
together,'' said the Chinese official, who favors close ties with
the United States. ``We should thank him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan on Wednesday, Lee rejected the sobriquet
``troublemaker'' that Beijing has tried to pin on him, saying that
Taiwan should wait until China is more democratic and economically
developed before it seriously considers reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between China and Taiwan, conducted in off-again-on-again
since they began in 1993, appear to be off again. Wang Daohan, a
senior Chinese official scheduled to visit Taiwan in October, is
virtually certain to cancel that trip.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Wang is waiting for his Taiwan counterpart, Koo
Chen-fu, to take a public stance on Taiwan-China relations before a
decision is made about continuing talks. But Beijing said over the
weekend that with the vanishing premise of the talks _ that both
sides agree on a ``one China'' formula _ it is highly unlikely that
they will go forward.
</P>
<P>
   From Beijing's view, the danger of taking no real action in
response to Lee's move is that politicians in Taiwan may conclude
that they can take steps to distance themselves further from China
without any negative response from Beijing.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an effort to deliver a tough-sounding, but ultimately
ambiguous, message, Beijing appears to have authorized news reports
in China-backed news media in Hong Kong that report on military
preparations off the Taiwan coast.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Wen Wei Po, a Communist Party-owned newspaper in Hong
Kong that rarely reports sensitive political news without
instruction from Beijing, reported in unusual detail about military
preparations by the Nanjing Military Region, which oversees Chinese
military forces in Fujian province, across the coast from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The paper reported that the deputy chief of staff of the Nanjing
Military Region, Su Jing, had watched military drills in which
sailors sang, ``We will liberate Taiwan.'' Yet two days later,
officials in the region denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The report Wednesday by China News Service appeared to follow
the same pattern, reporting military preparations that send a
guarded signal to Taiwan, but allowing Beijing room for
deniability.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Taiwan military intelligence has told local news
media that it had detected no serious military activity on the
mainland side of the 100-mile wide strait that separates Taiwan
from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   As Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan of China reminded reporters in
Singapore this week, China has never renounced the threat of using
force against Taiwan, should peaceful means fail to achieve
Beijing's cherished goal of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   In more tough-sounding language, the New China News Agency
reported Wednesday that the chief of the People's Liberation Army
general staff had warned Lee to stop ``separatist'' activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PLA has the determination and strength to defend the
state's sovereignty and territorial integrity,'' the official, Fu
Quanyou, told a visiting Malaysian military official.
</P>
<P>
   Yet behind such language, there seems to be relatively little
punch.
</P>
<P>
   One factor often overlooked by outsiders is that military
experts say any large-scale amphibious assault on Taiwan by China
would face enormous military difficulties. Taiwan, operating
American-supplied F-16 fighter planes, has distinct air
superiority.
</P>
<P>
   Even a more militarily feasible attack on one of the small
islands controlled by Taiwan that are next to China's southern
coast, Kinmen and Matsu, could prompt retaliation by Taiwanese
guided missiles that would cause serious damage to mainland cities.
</P>
<P>
   A less direct military confrontation could involve the launching
of Chinese missiles into the sea near Taiwan, as in 1995 and 1996,
or an attempt to blockade sea traffic around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   There is little sign that Beijing has the political will for
military action in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders left Beijing this week for the seaside resort of
Beidaihe, where they are holding an annual political gathering
intended to sort out pressing issues of the day. Although Taiwan
may be on the agenda, leaders appear to be more concerned now with
Falun Gong, the spiritual movement that Beijing has outlawed and
has made the target of a major political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other top issue at the gathering is said to be money-losing
state-run industries, which the authorities have been trying to
reorganize, without success.

GROUP SAYS LEBANESE BEING EXPELLED FROM HOMES BY ISRAELI-BACKED
MILITIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Hundreds of Lebanese have been expelled from their
homes in Israeli-held southern Lebanon since 1985 by a local
militia armed and financed by Israel, according to a report issued
here Wednesday by Human Rights Watch, an American group.
</P>
<P>
   Based on testimony from expelled families, the report paints a
picture of harsh punishment of people whose relatives had attacked
Israeli forces, joined guerrilla groups, deserted the militia or
refused to work as informers.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-page report shed light on practices that have gone
virtually unreported because of severe restrictions on entry to the
zone by journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials acknowledged that expulsions have taken place,
but denied that they were conducted under Israeli policy. An
Israeli army spokesman declined to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   The evictions were from a nine-mile-wide swath of Lebanese
territory carved out by Israel in 1985 as a buffer against
guerrilla attacks on its northern communities. The zone is
controlled by the Israeli army and the militia, called the South
Lebanon Army, and has been the scene of a protracted guerrilla war
waged by the Iranian-backed Party of God, or Hezbollah, to oust the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Expelled families were typically bundled into cars without
notice, taken to a militia office and then left at the northern
edge of the zone without a chance to collect personal possessions.
Leaving behind homes, farmland and livestock, many exiles have been
reduced to poverty, living in cramped apartments on the outskirts
of Beirut and in other cities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the expulsions a war crime under the Geneva Convention,
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said that
the latest eviction, of a mother and two children, took place last
Friday. He said the expulsions had increased over the last two
years, as concern about a possible Israeli withdrawal brought
mounting defections from the militia.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a new government in Israel, there is an opportunity to
call this a practice of the past,'' Roth said in an interview. ``If
the peace process is now being revived, it is important that Israel
treat its neighbors in a way that will promote the process. Tearing
civilians from their homes is not the kind of thing that will
engender trust on the part of Israel's negotiating partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Uri Lubrani, the coordinator of activities in Lebanon for this
Israeli Defense Ministry, strongly denied assertions that his
office was responsible for an expulsion policy and had approved
evictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a totally false allegation, and I wish most
emphatically to deny it,'' Lubrani wrote in a response last month
to queries relayed from Human Rights Watch. ``This premeditated,
malicious and slanderous piece of information is most probably
being disseminated by factors in Lebanon which are traditionally
hostile to Israel, and which want to exploit the naivete of those
who are not in a position to follow daily developments and are
ignorant of the true facts on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Lubrani's deputy, Reuven Erlich, said in an interview: ``Our
office has nothing to do with such decisions. We don't deal at all
with this matter. We deal with political and diplomatic issues. Our
office is not of an intelligence nature.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli army spokesman refused to comment on the report.
Other Israeli officials asserted that some expulsions were
motivated by family feuds, land disputes and score-settling between
Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth said that his group had found ``a clear pattern of
cases that don't involve feuds.''
</P>
<P>
   The report cites accounts of Israeli intelligence officers
interrogating people before their expulsion, of Israelis taking
part in evictions, and of members of the militia telling deportees
that they were acting on orders of the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of expulsions is unknown because no systematic
records have been kept, but the report estimates that hundreds of
Lebanese men, women and children have been expelled since 1985. In
1998, 46 Lebanese who were expelled reported their cases to local
offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the report
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last January, 25 members of an extended family, including a
60-year-old woman and 16 children, were expelled from the village
of Sheba after two brothers from the family were arrested in the
killing of the local militia security chief, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   A trader from the village of Markaba, Kamal Abdel Karim Yunes,
was expelled with his family in 1989 after he resisted persistent
pressure to become an informer, the report said. According to
Yunes' account, he had been put under house arrest, his son was
jailed for 2 1/2 months, and he was forced to drive on roads
exposed to attack to supply Israeli military outposts before he was
finally expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Other people were expelled after their children had fled forced
conscription or had deserted the militia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah and Khadija Abdullah were expelled from the village of
Houla in 1996, a week after a son who had been pressed into service
deserted. Mrs. Abdullah recalled that they were taken to a militia
position and informed that they were being expelled. She said they
were refused permission to bring belongings from their house and
told: ``You cannot set foot in Houla again.''

INDEPENDENT FILMMAKERS IN SEATTLE FLOAT BIG DREAMS ON TINY
BUDGETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   July 26, 1999
</P>
<P>
   Dear Quentin Tarantino: Please consider the following treatment
for the big screen. It's Seattle. It's strange. It's sexy, in a
damp, twisted Jet City kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   Yrs,
</P>
<P>
   M.L. Lyke
</P>
<P>
   cc: G. Lucas, S. Spielberg, F. Coppola et al.
</P>
<P>
   Synopsis: Dreams and heartache are the themes of this story. The
dream is to make a film, a bustaway independent feature film that
knocks mainstream Hollywood on its liposuctioned tush. The
heartache is what can happen in the process. It is set in Seattle,
city of anti-heroes, low clouds, high suicide rates, rain and
Microsoft millionaires. It stars bright, eager young filmmakers _
most white, most male _ who will hock everything to get a script on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Sample Scenes:
</P>
<P>
   Scene One: Time is money
</P>
<P>
   Focus on dark, post-apocalyptic movie set built in Underground
Seattle, beneath busy Pioneer Square sidewalk. Scan past set of
devastated convenience store _ the melted videos, a Home magazine
charred and curled at edges, the ceilings dripping fried wires. Pan
in on a 24-inch-tall model of hunchbacked, insectoid alien. Follow
hyperkinetic director onto set of cryogenic lab, with two mummified
corpses and two very alive, bare-bellied combat babes in Mad Max
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Catch hectic gestures of director Tim Hines, head-to-toe in
black, as he rehearses his subterranean cast of two in escape
scene. ``You come out shooting. Like this: Blew! Blew! Blew!''
</P>
<P>
   Hines, 38, with several well-received indie features under his
belt, is a breathless whirlwind, talking 100 miles per hour. His
hands flit like butterflies, the wings curling, shaking, then
taking flight as his body bends and face twists, giving direction.
</P>
<P>
   His producer Lora Oliver, with rolls of gaffer tape hanging on
her belt, looks worried. She checks her watch.
</P>
<P>
   Close-up of watch: ``It's 10:33!'' she calls out.
</P>
<P>
   Time is money. Money is short. Producer Oliver and
director/writer Hines have budgeted three weeks to shoot `Bug
Wars,'' a sci-fi film about spiderlike aliens who invade Earth
after a doomsday war.
</P>
<P>
   It's a three-week, 12-hour-a-day race, requiring breakneck
decisions and turbo-charged stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``11:06!'' Tick, tick. Ka-ching, ka-ching.
</P>
<P>
   The film is low budget. Ultra low: $65,000, a sneeze in
Tinseltown terms, and a big comedown from $35 million. That was the
``Bug'' budget when Hines was still in negotiations with a
Hollywood distributor.
</P>
<P>
   The distributor offered Hines $17.5 million. All Hines had to do
was come up with the other half. He spent a year and a half trying.
</P>
<P>
   Close-up of Hines' eager, Boy Wonder face. ``Raising that money
was impossible! Six or seven times I built up the tower, then one
piece would fall out and the whole thing crumbled.''
</P>
<P>
   Focus on hands curling, uncurling. ``Hollywood _ how it works is
they offer you a bunch of money, but it's like a greased balloon.
Every time you reach for it, it slips farther away.''
</P>
<P>
   Scene Two: Dumpster diving
</P>
<P>
   Cut back to combat babes _ two cryogenic engineers unfrozen
decades after the obliteration of their species. They are awaiting
their cue in the devastated lab. They're trapped by invisible
aliens. Their weapons are toy guns, spray-painted black and brown.
Their sweet, unlined faces are streaked with burnt cork.
</P>
<P>
   Pan across set to director, behind camera. ``One ... two ...
three ... and ... action,'' says Hines. The camera is rolling. The
babes inch across the set in high-topped black leather boots,
bodies alert, faces taut. Their timing's perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Close up on director's animated face: ``Wonderful! Beautiful!''
beams Hines. He nails the scene in one take. That's footage saved,
time saved, money saved. Hines has become a regular Zorro at
cutting costs. ``A voice in the back of my head said, `You can do
this on a tiny, tiny budget.'''
</P>
<P>
   Flashback to Hines poring over ``Bug'' budget. He explains the
bulk of ``Bug Wars'' will be shot on green screens, and
computer-created special effects will be superimposed in
post-production. The 24-inch insectoid alien will become an
18-foot-tall nightmare, the walls of this dank basement will become
a collapsing subway, the two barely clad Earth girls will battle
aliens against a ``virtual'' city modeled on Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on Hines' zippy hands as he explains how he and his
multitasking crew of four maxed a meager budget. They scavenged
Value Village and Goodwill thrift stores, garage sales and back
alleys in Pioneer Square to create sets and costumes. They became
die-hard Dumpster-divers. ``If a Dumpster was unlocked and open,''
says the director, ``we were in it.''
</P>
<P>
   They dragged styrofoam, display racks, a tossed-off camouflage
net to the set, spray-painted them, and transformed them into
desolate reminders of a toasted human civilization.
</P>
<P>
   They borrowed extension cords from everyone they knew to wire
lights and sound. They scored 10 truckloads of computer parts
headed for a landfill. ``The deal was, don't return them,'' says
Hines.
</P>
<P>
   They created a camera dolly with a wheelchair found at a
hospital thrift shop and improvised special effects, splattering
the actresses with ``bug guts'' made of strawberry applesauce and
Rice Krispies.
</P>
<P>
   They filled a crock pot with beans to feed the crew, bought
bread and pop and an 80-ounce jar of Adam's 100 percent natural
peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   And then they made a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Scene Three: The Death Scene
</P>
<P>
   Pan the set. Catch crop-topped combat babes huddling between
takes, the pale flesh on their arms covered in goose bumps from the
chill of the dank basement. Corree Dibble, ivory-skinned and
copper-curled, demonstrates the death scene she has rehearsed for
days in a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Close up of Dibble's delicate features twisting grotesquely:
``So the bug bites off my ear and my hand and I'm looking at my
hand, and it's gone, and I'm, like, `Ehhhhh!'
</P>
<P>
   Dibble is half the cast of ``Bug Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   The other half is Darlene Sellers, a dark-eyed beauty who is
using vacation time from her job at the King County Parks and
Recreation Department for the three-week shoot. Sellers, 28, has
some previous indie experience. Dibble, a 23-year-old waitress from
Portland, is a neophyte.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've got lots of energy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Back up for lingering full-body shot of Dibble, whose pierced
belly button peeks over black stretch shorts. Along with 50 other
hopefuls, she answered the audition call for ``Bug Wars'' in the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The director found her a natural. Dibble agrees. She's got the
bug. And it's not just superhero fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I'm going to conquer Hollywood!'' she exults, then
laughs, looking around her at the blackened, devastated set.
``Although I don't think this is how I'm going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scene Four: Knock on wood
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to portrait of an exhausted, but happy Hines. He
has finished the ``Bug Wars'' shoot ahead of schedule, doing 900
setups in 15 days. He and Oliver will spend the next five months in
post-production. They won't bother with a theatrical print. This
film's not headed for the minimal multiplex. It's going straight to
video, cable, pay-per-view and syndicated TV markets.
</P>
<P>
   Will it make money?
</P>
<P>
   Hines laughs. ``It's conceivable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any wood nearby to knock on?''
</P>
<P>
   He's already at work on the sequel.

STAKES ARE HUGE IN INDEPENDENT FILMMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deep background
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaking is addictive, seductive, as alluring as the vamp with
bedroom eyes clinking cubes in her whiskey and soda at the end of
the smoky bar. Money and fame lurk in those eyes. And _ for
lustful, young independent moviemakers in Seattle _ danger.
</P>
<P>
   Odds of an upstart indie filmmaker crashing into the big time
are on par with winning the lottery. But even the lottery has
winners. Low-budget breakaways such as Kevin Smith's quirky
``Clerks'' (cost: $30,000) and Robert Rodriguez's ``Il Mariachi''
(original budget $7,000) have established mainstream Hollywood
careers for their creators. They also have fueled an unprecedented
boom of independent filmmaking across America.
</P>
<P>
   A boom _ and a glut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an explosion now of what I call independent junk,''
says Kathleen McInnis, a programmer for the Seattle International
Film Festival. ``Too many filmmakers haven't paid their dues. They
haven't learned the storytelling part. They have no vision. They
just want to make a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 indie feature films from around the world were
submitted to this year's festival. About 150 ended up on screen,
and only four of those were from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet five or six indie films may be in production at any given
time in the Rainy City. ``The more people hear about it, the more
do it. It has a snowball effect,'' says 31-year-old Seattle
filmmaker Erik Hammen, creator of ``Love My Guts,'' a $45,000
romantic comedy about two young Seattle artists that ``deglamorizes
the starving artist thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammen, by day a contractor at Microsoft, moved here three years
ago from rural New York after hearing tales of an emerging film
scene. ``It's only increased since I moved here.''
</P>
<P>
   He compares the local film scene to the scrappy, underdog music
scene that burst into the national consciousness in the early '90s
as the chicly un-chic Grunge movement. ``Eventually, a film from
Seattle will break through and become famous. Then we can say we
knew Seattle in the good old days, before it got sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   These could, indeed, be the good old days for Seattle
independents.
</P>
<P>
   The city's hopping alternative scene offers would-be auteurs
classes, advice and access to low-cost/no-cost equipment.
Restaurants such as Mama's Mexican Kitchen, the Coastal Kitchen and
the Alibi Room, a hangout for filmies, donate food and space for
fund-raisers. Some local breweries and wineries exchange goods for
``product placement'' in films.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this city are willing to support the arts,'' says
Hammen. ``They like Seattle to be a city that is vibrant and
artistic.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a city of young money, young ideas and disposable income.
New millionaires from Amazon.com and Microsoft have dug into their
pockets to help bank indie films. As the Dow soars, so does
investor potential.
</P>
<P>
   The risks are huge: artistic risks, emotional risks, financial
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many stumbling blocks in filmmaking, and they
are very, very large,'' says Jamie Hook, director of Wiggly World,
a non-profit studio on Capitol Hill dedicated to providing
independents with the equipment and facilities to create ``great
art.''
</P>
<P>
   Some projects may implode two scenes into a shoot. Some long
before that. The stories are legion.
</P>
<P>
   Indie filmmakers Lorn Richey, 37, and Rebecca Tartarsky, 28,
scraped together savings from their 9-to-6 jobs, then sold shares
in a limited partnership to finance their $120,000 film. Called
``Pickers,'' it told the story of hip young shoppers who buy
castaway retro clothes at thrift shops and garage sales and resell
them for big bucks to vintage stores.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May, the young married couple gathered the ``Pickers''
cast and crew at a benefit party at Wiggly World. Filming was to
begin in June. The buzz was on. But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors pulled out. The schedule fell into chaos. The
film was indefinitely postponed. ``It's pretty depressing,'' said
Richey. ``I've been progressing to larger and larger projects. This
was going to be the biggest.''
</P>
<P>
   Snohomish filmmaker Sam Severn's ``Cosmic Ray,'' a $300,000 rock
'n' roll sci-fi film that began filming in Seattle this spring,
deconstructed for different reasons.
</P>

   A set's a volatile place, one filmmakers alternately describe as
a pressure cooker and a time bomb. This one went off. ``The
artistic differences led to a lot of bad feelings about the
direction the film was going,'' says Severn. ``I feel like I've
gone through the gates of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Severn and his wife years to raise money for ``Cosmic
Ray.'' Now the family, including three children, are cinching
belts. ``We pretty much burned off all of our own money,'' says
Severn.
</P>
<P>
   Money's the hated despot of independent filmmakers. Some have
mortgaged homes to bank films. Some have maxed out credit cards,
sold blood at blood banks, depleted college trusts, sold bodies to
medicine and, allegedly, sold bodies to other humans.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Schmidt, author of ``Feature Filmmaking at Used-Car
Prices,'' advises hawking family antiques, or going a year without
paying the rent if necessary. He confesses to robbing his
daughter's piggy bank at a particularly low point.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, of course, sold his own used car to bank a film.
</P>
<P>
   That's the indie gamble. Stakes are huge. But the pull is
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who walk through our door are excited for the
wrong reason. They think they're going to make it big,'' says
Wiggly World's Hook. ``They think they're going to be famous. They
have stars in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the dame.
</P>
<P>
   When that sultry temptress at the end of the bar finally crooks
a long, red-tipped finger, winks, and pats the well-worn seat next
to her, what yearning young filmmaker wouldn't dream of a happy
Hollywood ending?

COST-CUTTING TIPS FOR MAKING INDEPENDENT FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Costs of making an independent feature film continue to drop
dramatically as technology evolves. ``If you can afford to drive a
car, you should be able to make a film,'' writes Rick Schmidt in
``Feature Filmmaking at Used-Car Prices'' (Penguin Books, 354
pages, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's book is a veritable hints-from-Heloise for
corner-cutting indies. He advises:
</P>
<P>
   _ Shoot in 16 mm, instead of 35 mm, and shoot in black and
white. These can halve the cost.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shoot scenes in a minimum number of takes to conserve valuable
film footage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use cheap locations _ an overgrown backyard can become the
wilds of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use cheap labor. Many actors and crew members will work on
low-budget productions for deferred salaries or profit shares.
Non-actors and beginning crew may work simply for the experience _
i.e. free.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the faith. ``If you don't quit, you can finish your
no-budget feature before you die.''
</P>

CONGRESS URGED TO AMEND DEPORTATION LAWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying immigrants deserve their day in court, civil
rights leaders Wednesday urged Congress to amend three 1996 laws
that give the federal government largely unrestricted deportation
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders' call for change touched off a dispute between the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, who chairs the House immigration subcommittee. The INS
agreed that the laws improperly removed the discretion of federal
judges in deportation cases. Smith countered that the problem with
immigration is not bad laws but inadequate INS enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In passing the three laws, Congress attempted to stem illegal
immigration by giving the INS the ability to quickly deport
immigrants, including those with resident status, who have criminal
records.
</P>
<P>
   The laws assisted the government's effort by requiring judges to
consider an immigrant's criminal past in deciding whether to uphold
a deportation decision.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of three civil rights groups said Congress went
too far, and they assailed the 1996 laws for depriving immigrants
of their due-process rights. In particular, the statutes
inappropriately removed judges' long-standing authority to
disregard a resident immigrant's criminal record in deportation
proceedings, said leaders of the American Immigration Lawyers'
Association, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
</P>
<P>
   The three laws are the 1996 Illegal Immigration Control and
Immigrant Responsibility Act, the Anti-Terrorist and Effective
Death Penalty Act and the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Butterfield, executive director of the lawyers'
association, denounced Congress for stripping immigrants of their
due-process rights in a ``frenzy of anti-immigrant backlash.'' She
added that ``Congress needs to act now'' to restore those rights.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Henderson, executive director of the leadership conference,
decried the laws for stripping judges of discretion. ``It is
important that civil rights be measured by a single yardstick,'' he
said, adding that immigrants should be afforded the same rights in
court as U.S. citizens enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Jess Hordes, government affairs director of the anti-defamation
league, said the United States should have strong immigration laws
to protect its citizens but that the 1996 statutes are excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the U.S. has the right and the obligation to ensure
that unworthy applicants do not take advantage of the asylum
system,'' Hordes said. ``But this should never be done in haste,
without adequate protections. The current system belies our
nation's moral character and humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   INS spokesman Russ Bergeron echoed the call for a restoration of
judicial discretion. Judges should be permitted to expunge the
record of upstanding resident immigrants who committed minor
offenses years ago and have already paid their debts to society,
Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot more sense to have the immigration judges
decide an individual's case ... and make (the immigrant) whole
again,'' Bergeron said. ``That's simply in the best interests of
all the parties, including the alien.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said the laws are not the problem. Smith, an outspoken
INS critic, said the agency should take a more active role in
expediting the admission of qualified immigrants while ensuring
that undesirables be denied entry to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS hid for years behind the shoddy claim it had no
discretion to intervene in the deportations of true hardship
cases,'' Smith said. ``But like every other prosecutor in the
nation, it does have discretion. It just hasn't been willing to
exercise it to benefit immigrants.''

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; NASA CUTS WOULD DRAW BLOOD AT LOCAL LEVEL  &UR; By Jonathan
Lipman &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   Special to space.com &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Severe cuts in NASA programs mean severe impacts on
the local economies which host NASA research centers, business
leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives is considering over $1 billion in
NASA budget cuts and is proposing the wholesale elimination of some
developing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard Space Flight Center, which as the managing site for the
Triana satellite and the Pathfinder-class probes would be one of
the most severely hit centers, is one of the biggest employers in
Maryland's Prince George's county.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a severe impact to us,'' said Bonnie Beck,
Executive Vice President for the Prince George's Chamber of
Commerce. ``We have a number of contractors to Goddard.'' The
county has at least 900 high-tech firms, she said, the
second-largest concentration in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber was part of a grass-roots effort led by Rep. Steny
Hoyer (D-Md.) to oppose cuts at Goddard several years ago, Beck
said, and would do it again if more cuts loomed. ``We'd send
information to our members and ask them to contact their
congressmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer blasted the cuts and vowed to do ``everything possible to
see that funding is restored for Goddard'' in a prepared statement.
He said the GOP plan would cut $428 million from the center.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Research Center in Ohio, which specializes in aerospace
technology, may also lose programs or staff if NASA's budget is
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to predict what will happen, but one thing that is
certain is that NASA is a powerful element of the Ohio economy,''
said Council member Christopher Coburn, Vice President of the
non-profit research and development group, the Battelle Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``These large public research institutions have been shown
repeatedly to be keys to regional economic growth,'' Coburn said.
``At Glenn, we're talking 3,000 direct technological jobs'' and
twice that in indirectly provided jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, it creates a pool of technical staff in the
region that you wouldn't have otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders in Mountainview, Calif., home of the Ames
Research Center, did not have a formal comment on the issue
available, a chamber of commerce spokeswoman said, but acknowledged
that they were concerned and were moving quickly to decide upon a
response.

 Editors note: The San Francisco Chronicle rounds up the best
of  the unusual for home and garden in this regular feature, Off
the 
 Wall.   Start Your Own Papier-Mache Menagerie 
 &HT;       
   
 By Karyn Houston  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Invite a little bit of Mexico into your home with
handmade papier-mache products that are sure to spark some lively
conversations.
<P>
   Alfred Preciado got into the papier-mache importing business in
a roundabout way. In 1965, his uncle, who produces the distinctive
art  &LR; pieces in Mexico, offered him a job selling the products in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Preciado wasn't interested. He had a good-paying job in the
automotive industry and wasn't about to give up those benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A stress-induced heart attack in 1990 made him change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the job and went back to Mexico,'' Preciado said. He
asked his uncle: ``Do you still have that job open?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been open for 35 years,'' his uncle replied.
</P>
<P>
   A business was born.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; st  &LR; All of  &UR; Casa de Preciado's &LR;  sculptures are made in Mexico
using a centuries-old 12-step process. Time is taken after each
step to be sure the product properly dries before the next step.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, a reusable plastic mold is made of the product.
Artists fill the mold with cardboard and paste. After the piece is
released from the mold, it is sanded, covered with newspaper and
ultimately hand painted with its final design, then lacquered to
preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   The best seller is the colorful macaw on a perch. Other hot
sellers are 7-foot-tall giraffes, carousel horses and a sun with a
face painted on it. A miniaturized set of seven angels also sells
well, as does a group of mariachis that can be hung on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The products are recommended for indoor use only, though they
can be put outside for short periods. One San Francisco shop owner
places a giraffe in front of the store each morning to attract
customers. It has been a great conversation piece.
</P>
<P>
   Preciado sells the colorful creatures at gift shows and by
appointment. Some are available immediately; others must be
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The giraffe retails for $1,211; the macaw for $462; and the
carousel horses from $353 to $738. Custom orders are available.

 Editors note: Psst! Read the latest? If not, you haven't
read  HotStuff, the San Francisco Chronicle's weekly roundup of
great 
 new home-and-garden items and places to visit.   HOT STUFF: Book Honors Revival of Arts and Crafts Style  
 
    Chase Reynolds Ewald, a writer in Tiburon, Calif., truly loves
furnishings made in the Arts and Crafts tradition.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That love affair intensified when she moved into a Frank Lloyd
Wright-inspired home designed by a fellow of Taliesin West. She
wanted to fill the home with furniture of the same genre, and so
she became intimately familiar with artists involved in the
revivalist Arts and Crafts movement. Many of them are in the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a stunning book of artistic profiles entitled
 &UR; ``Arts and Crafts Style and Spirit, Craftspeople of the &LR; 
 &UR; Revival.'' &LR;  It is a testament to Ewald's painstaking research about
artists who are currently making Arts and Crafts-style furniture in
the tradition of Morris, Stickley and Greene &AMP; Greene.
</P>
<P>
   The Arts and Crafts movement was in full swing between 1900 and
1920, when people were looking for a simple response to
overwhelming technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   Ewald thinks the same type of response is occurring now, as
artists re-create the straightforward functionality of a Morris
chair or Stickley chest of drawers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in the whole artistic process _ I'm interested
in people who are driven to do what they do,'' she says. ``No one
does this for the money, or fame or glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artisans profiled here are from Northern California.
The book is filled with photographs of simple, elegant pieces from
artists like Debey Zito of San Francisco (furniture), Michael Adams
(metalwork) and Dianne Ayres (textiles).
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Arts and Crafts Style and Spirit,`` by Chase Reynolds Ewald &LR; 
 &LR; (Gibbs Smith; $34.95), is available in bookstores or via &LR; 
 &LR; amazon.com. &LR;

Carrol Caldwell used to enjoy hand lettering quotations on the
walls of her home. But painting a long quotation by Yeats in her
bathroom while tottering on a stepladder was agonizingly slow, so
she decided to speed up the process.
</P>
<P>
   After she had the words printed on vinyl, she completed the
project in just 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The graphic artist decided to share her speedy new technique
with others by starting a company called  &UR; Wall Words &LR; , based in
Orange County. She says anyone can easily master the technique of
transferring the letters to flat surfaces, using a wooden burnisher
that comes with the letters.
</P>
<P>
   She offers 63 sayings in four categories: loving quotations,
positive quotations, higher power quotations and kitchen slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell says many people enjoy putting funny sayings in their
kitchens. Two popular ones are: ``No husband has ever been shot
while doing the dishes'' and ``A balanced diet is a cookie in each
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   For other rooms in the house, people prefer more thoughtful
sentiments. Caldwell wrapped one of her favorites, by Peter
Ustinov, around a seven-foot-tall mural of her daughter that she
painted in her home. It says, ``Love is an endless act of
forgiveness, a tender look which becomes a habit.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters come in 11 colors in two standard typefaces and 22
custom styles. The standard faces cost $19.95 for 10 words, or
$29.95 for 11 to 20 words. Custom faces sell by the letter,
starting at $1 for a one-inch letter.

`BLAIR WITCH' CAPTURES YOUNG VIEWERS' IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By D. PARVAZ  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not real. Was it real?'' asked Tony Brave, 19.
Relieved to hear that indie horror flick ``The Blair Witch
Project'' is only a movie, Brave reflected on why it scared him
more than mega-bucks Hollywood slasher fests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it was (shot) with home videos, and it looked more
realistic than the glamour that you see on other movies.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Sarah Campbell, 17, took a more sociological look at
the movie's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people buy tickets because they want to feel fear.
This movie only does well because of fear, and I think fear is not
a good human emotion, man,'' said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can relate with those emotions. Everybody's felt
fear,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   They were just two of the thousands of moviegoers, most of them
teenagers or 20-somethings, who have made incredibly low-budget
``The Blair Witch Project'' the surprise hit of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Its appeal might be a bit of a mystery to those who believe
``Big Budget Blockbuster Equals Boffo Box Office Bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie about three young filmmakers who disappear while
making a documentary about a legendary witch had an initial
production cost of around $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   So far it's taken in about $5 million, including $2 million last
weekend, while playing on just 31 screens across the country. The
take is expected to increase dramatically after it expands to about
1,000 screens on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, ``Blair Witch'' brought in just over $130,000 in its
first week at the Neptune Theatre in the University District. The
total is up to about $231,000 now at the Neptune, which has
exclusive local rights to the film for its first two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's first-week take broke _ indeed, doubled _ the
Neptune's previous record of $64,000 for ``Star Wars: Episode One _
The Phantom Menace.'' Seven Gables/Landmark Theaters, which
operates the Neptune, cut short its scheduled run of the ``Star
Wars'' prequel in order to show ``Blair Witch.''
</P>
<P>
   All this aside, it's interesting to see why young people are
lining up for tickets at the Neptune.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about lining up at 5 p.m. for tickets to a
midnight showing.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking a movie made by unknown directors, starring
unknown actors, with nada special effects.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking giving up cherished and rare sunny Seattle days
for a 1 p.m. showing.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's draw has something to do with the fact that not many
of us can relate to being Neve Campbell, chased through a gorgeous
campus by a knife-wielding, mask-wearing psycho (see ``Scream,''
``Scream 2'' and _ sooner than later _ ``Scream 3'').
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what it's like to be Jennifer Love Hewitt, bosom
heaving, hair wild, running from a fisherman with a fetish for
disembowelment (``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' and (sigh) ``I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, those movies were cheesy scary, not legitimately
frightening,'' said Amy Lifson-Leu, 20, who along with friends
Dashal Moore, 19, and Magdalena Wolfe, 21, was waiting in line for
the 3 p.m. show at the Neptune on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one's supposed to be more realistic,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   It's been said the appeal of the movie lies in what you can't
see. That's not so much the appeal, but the reason why audiences
find it so effective as a horror story. It's everyone's horror
movie because being afraid of things that go bump in the night is
something we can all relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard it's really frightening, that it's really scary,''
said Moore, in response to the question of why she's in line to see
a movie on such a gorgeous day.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, Lifson-Leu and Wolfe all agreed what they'd heard of the
film's unusual format was a big draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I want to see it because it's based on a true story,''
Moore added.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not,'' piped in Lifson-Leu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's what I heard ... '' Moore responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just popular mythology to make people want to go,''
explained Lifson-Leu, knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is not alone in thinking the movie is somewhat fact-based.
In fact, ``Blair Witch'' seems to be effective in spooking
audiences because some actually believe that it's a true story (or
at least based on one).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this speaks of a certain willingness to believe that
all those freaky stories we heard at summer camp had some grain of
truth to them, that there really is a Boogeyman (or in this case,
woman) out in the woods, that we weren't just being had.
</P>
<P>
   The misconception that the movie is reality-based (a calculated
move by ``Blair Witch'' directors and marketers) is also a
testament to how genuine the film's ``mockumentary'' style really
is. It looks like someone's home movie, complete with shaky camera
work and images so fuzzy you have to use your imagination more than
you'd like.
</P>
<P>
   Off the record, more than one viewer mentioned liking that
they're getting to see it before anyone else _ a kind of a hipster
nose-thumbing thing that is such a guilty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the additional staff brought in to deal with the big
crowds have yet to see the movie. For one thing, ``A lot of people
are getting motion sickness because the camera's being all shaky,''
said David Pickett, 17.
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear he wasn't going to see the film. ``At least
three to five people throw up during each show.'' At the concession
stand, Jenet Yasuda-Verline, 19, had also made some observations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big football player-type of guys come in and they're like `Oh,
I'm not going to be scared of this movie,' and they come out,
really scared,'' she said, adding with a giggle, ``especially the
ones who see it at night, and they have to walk out into the
dark.''

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; NASA CUTS WOULD HIT HOME IN THE HOUSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Jonathan Lipman &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   States News Service &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Special to space.com &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 28 -- Opposition to proposed cuts in NASA's
budget is building in the House, fueled mostly by the few
congressmen who actively support the space program and by the more
numerous lawmakers whose districts get NASA money directly.
</P>
<P>
   A House Appropriations subcommittee voted to slash NASA funding
by $1.4 million on Monday. The measure will go the full committee
for a vote on Friday, and then the entire House must approve the
bill. The Senate version of the bill has not been written yet.
</P>
<P>
   On the full Appropriations Committee, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,
vowed to fight the cuts. Hoyer is the only Maryland representative
on the spending committee, and his district includes Goddard Space
Flight Center, which would take the brunt of the proposed cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cuts threaten the entire space program,'' Hoyer said.
``They are outrageous, irresponsible, and short-sighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., chairs the House subcommittee
on space and opposes the cuts made by his own party in the spending
bill. His committee authorized a three-year budget for NASA earlier
this year that gives the space agency about $13 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rohrabacher will fight for changes to that bill, said his chief
of staff Rick Dykema, but has not yet decided on a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult because you can't just offer amendments to
increase spending on appropriations bills, you've got to take it
from somewhere else,'' Dykema said.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman of the congressional Aviation and Space Caucus, Rep.
Dennis J. Kucinich, D-Ohio, said only that he is ``actively
working'' with Congressman Steven LaTourette, R-Ohio, to restore
the funds.
</P>
<P>
   The funding is not a hot issue in the Senate yet, sources said,
because the appropriations committee has not even written the
funding bill. A spokeswoman for Democratic Senator John Breaux,
ranking member of the Senate's Space subcommittee, said that Breaux
has no plans to lead a coalition for NASA funding, and she had not
heard of any other senator making such an effort. Other senatorial
aides said they were not even aware of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But individual senators facing cuts in their districts are
likely to fight. Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, actually held up the
NASA authorization bill in the Senate in order to insure that Glenn
Research Center got it's full share of funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, absolutely, he will always and continues to defend
the jabs at NASA Glenn,'' said DeWine spokesman Charlie Boesel.
``That's just part of who and what he is... However, we are still
very early in the process and we are still working on our version
in the Senate.''

 CHRON   Water, Water Everywhere  
 The fastest-growing garden idea glitters everywhere  
   
   
 By Janet Fletcher  
 Chronicle Staff Writer  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Plants give gardens their color and texture, but
water brings gardens to life. No wonder garden designers are almost
unanimous in suggesting that a water feature _ in the form of a
pond, a gurgling fountain or simply a beautiful water-filled urn _
belongs in every landscape. And apparently clients are listening.
Bay Area designers, pond installers and nursery staffers report a
soaring interest in water gardening.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Water is really a phenomenal focal point,'' says Louis
Devereux, a San Francisco landscape designer who says he installs
water features in about half of his projects. ``Of all the things
you can put in a garden, it is among the most dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazel White, the San Francisco author of a book on water
gardening, says water appeals to our most basic instincts,
invariably drawing and holding our attention. ``It's like a
fireplace indoors,'' she says. ``People are attracted to water in
the same way they're attracted to fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Properly located, a water feature shimmers in direct sun.
Overhead branches trace patterns on the water, and mystery lurks in
its murky depths. A breeze sends a floating water lettuce scurrying
across the surface; a hovering mosquito lures a goldfish up for a
snack.
</P>
<P>
   Features with moving water, such as fountains and streams, also
captivate viewers and soothe them with sounds that block out urban
noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the softness of plants, the softness of water, and
then the hardness and strength of stone,'' Mill Valley
water-feature expert Ron Stotts says. ``There's a balance there
that resonates with people whether they're aware of it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Plain or Fancy
</P>
<P>
   A water feature can be as rustic as a salvaged old sink nestled
among garden plants or as grandly dynamic as the 65-foot stream
flowing into a pond that Stotts designed for filmmaker George
Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   White suggests that novices start with a single simple bowl to
explore reflections and see if they like the look of plants on
water. Antiques stores and salvage yards can yield attractive old
birdbaths, basins, flowerpots and urns; many nurseries have
handsome ceramic or granite containers suitable for water
gardening.
</P>
<P>
   White prefers containers that are dark inside. ``If it's light,
you see right to the bottom and you see everything collected on the
bottom,'' she says. ``There's no mystery.'' Surface reflections are
also brighter against a dark background.
</P>
<P>
   You can raise a beautiful container on a pedestal or sink an
unattractive one in the ground and disguise its edges with plants.
You can plug any drainage holes with corks and silicone caulking
and make porous containers watertight with sealant. Used wine
barrels should be fitted with readily available plastic liners to
prevent leached wine from harming plants or fish.
</P>
<P>
   More-ambitious water gardeners may want to advance to a pond,
which is really just a big container. Although many people turn to
a professional, building a pond is within the reach of a handy
homeowner. Garden centers and hardware stores sell rubber pond
liners, filters and pumps; numerous books detail the process of
digging, lining, filling, planting and maintaining your pond.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Dietter of San Francisco has built 200 to 300 ponds in the
Bay Area in the last six years, most of them one- to two-day
projects. After digging the hole, Dietter puts down an underliner
to protect the liner from puncture. Made from EPDM _ ethylene
propylene diene monomer _ a new material that has revolutionized
pond building, the liner is flexible and guaranteed to last for 20
years, Dietter says.
</P>
<P>
   Stotts' ponds are more elaborate and consequently more
expensive. To give the bottom a natural appearance, he covers the
EPDM liner with earth-color concrete, then sets rocks in the
concrete. Not surprisingly, this pond artist scorns the preformed,
rigid liners that some garden centers sell. ``You can never hide it
in a way that looks natural,'' Stotts says. ``It always looks like
you've got a preformed pond.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall fountains require a water-collection basin and both a
submersible pump and tubing that must be hidden. ``As soon as you
get into moving water, you're getting into disguise,'' White says.
Perennial vines, such as ivy, can help mask the mechanics that
would otherwise ruin the romance. Submersible pumps can also add
pleasing movement and sound to ponds and to the simplest container
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, most experts recommend putting a water
feature in full sun to get the benefit of reflections on the water.
``The most beautiful aspect of a water feature is the
reflections,'' White says. ``Put it in sunshine so you get the
glitter and the diamonds on the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts offer other tips as well:
</P>
<P>
   If possible, position the feature away from messy trees and
shrubs, or you will be constantly skimming unwanted leaves and
berries.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the view from the house and the deck. You may want the
water visible from an upstairs bedroom or from the kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   Put the feature within reach of garden visitors so people can
trail their fingers through it.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid putting a pond at the bottom of a slope, or rain and
irrigation water may wash mud into it.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to planting a water feature, experts part company.
White is a purist, preferring to plant sparingly and leave space
for reflections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people overplant,'' she says. ``I ask people to consider
the beauty of the reflections _ the clouds passing overhead,
overhanging branches, upside-down pictures of roses, reflections of
an arbor or the architecture of the house. If you put too many
plants on a water feature, you lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, planting thickly helps reduce algae growth by
blocking sunlight and providing competition for nutrients. Some
designers recommend covering at least half a pond's surface with
floating plants to discourage the slimy green growth.
</P>
<P>
   And some water features need no plants at all. When Devereux
found a two-foot boulder in a client's backyard, he drilled a hole
through it, ran copper tubing through the hole, set the boulder
over a disguised water basin with a pump and created a riveting
water feature.
</P>
<P>
   Before you plant anything in a water feature, learn to recognize
the different kinds of aquatic plants. Some, like water lilies,
like to be planted in deep water so most of the plant is submerged;
their leaves may float on the surface, but their roots are in soil.
Others, such as water hyacinth, are true surface floaters with
roots floating freely in the water. Some aquatic plants, known as
oxygenators, live totally underwater. Finally, shallow-water
plants, such as water iris, like their roots in the soil but most
of their foliage in the air.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planting a small container that you can drain and
clean easily, you can get by with just one or two plants chosen
purely for aesthetics. But a pond or large container garden needs a
more balanced ecosystem to minimize algae growth. Experts recommend
planting both surface floaters to shade the pond (algae dislike
shade) and oxygenators to compete with algae for nutrients.
Properly planted and maintained, says Stotts, most ponds won't need
a mechanical filter.
</P>
<P>
   Because water plants grow quickly if unrestrained, most people
suggest planting them in plastic pots filled with aquatic potting
soil, garden soil or sandy loam. Never use soil with organic
amendments or fertilizers, which will leach into the water and
nourish the algae. Top the planting with pea gravel to keep the
soil in place, then lower into the pond or container. Bricks or
other platforms can keep the pots at the desired height.
</P>
<P>
   Water gardens need minimal maintenance. Small containers need
topping up frequently, especially in hot weather. Most aquatic
plants will need dividing and repotting once a year. Walt
McAllister of McAllister Water Gardens in Yountville says he drains
all his ponds in spring, root-prunes or divides the plants, then
repots them. For water lilies, which are heavy feeders, he buries
some slow-release fertilizer in the soil. Most other plants get all
the nourishment they need from the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fish to a pond or tub garden will help control mosquitoes
and algae. County water abatement districts will also deliver free
mosquito fish to any pond owner at no charge, and these tiny fish
provide effective control. Unfortunately, there's no surefire way
to banish marauding raccoons. Electric fences deter them but shock
children and pets, too.
</P>
<P>
   For most water gardeners, a bigger concern is algae growth.
``It's the No. 1 thing that disturbs people,'' McAllister says,
``and there's no easy answer.'' Water-gardening pros like
McAllister and White encourage people to relax about algae, to
recognize it as a natural occurrence in every pond and not a sign
that something is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you call it a problem, then everyone has a
problem,'' McAllister says. Plants and fish can control it but will
never vanquish it; the best attitude is acceptance, maybe even
modest appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't actually dislike algae,'' White says. ``It doesn't
mean the water is dirty. It's a natural thing, and it can be
extremely beautiful. An algae stain will age a water feature so it
doesn't look brand new. Besides, you don't want it superclean, or
you can see the mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   For the serenity they add to gardens and the hospitable home
they offer to many desirable plants, water features earn high marks
from almost every designer. ``There's a level of intimacy that
happens around water,'' Stotts says; people naturally gather there
and want to stay. When clients agree to add a water feature, he
says, ``they don't understand the gift they're giving themselves.''

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Successful ponds include a variety of plants. Some plants, such as

   WASHINGTON _ Politicians looking to their days of takeover now
submit to imageers to find ways of makeover. They steer not by
their internal compass but by some wind-sensitive telltale, and
mistakenly assume that what worked for Bill Clinton will work for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Take Al Gore. He is a man we all know _ solid, dependable, a
little kooky on the environment but experienced in foreign affairs
and a proven killer in TV debates. Because he is the scapegoat for
Clinton's sins, the vice president is running behind the untested
son of Clinton's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he is being told to remake his persona. Spooked by
macabre bumper stickers like ``Nixon in 2000 _ he's not as stiff as
Gore,'' his handlers are hectoring him to squeeze more hands, bite
more lip and feel more pain. Focus groups want him to morph himself
into Clinton with rectitude.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Gore is well positioned now as the overdog for the
nomination and underdog for election. Time enough in the
Gore-Bradley debates to reassert his grasp of message; after that,
he can assert that the natural narrowing of poll gaps with George
W. shows a surge of interest in the underappreciated old shoe. But
if he panics and pretends to be a ``new Gore,'' he's finished.
</P>
<P>
   Same with Hillary. Told by pollsters that her liberalism is
passe in New York, she embraces the upstate dairy cartel that will
increase milk prices to her formerly cherished inner-city mothers
by 12 cents a gallon. She hastily abandons her pro-Palestinian tilt
to make ``aliyah'' to Jerusalem. Image remakers think that's smart
politics, but she is more danger to the GOP as an authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Now take the Russian PM-of-the-month, Sergei Stepashin. Boris
Yeltsin's current favorite is here to wheedle a few more billions
out of the IMF. He is a cop _ the interior minister who messed up
in Chechnya _ but in this tour, he is determined to fake a sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   He told a joke at the press club. Fifty years ago, it went this
way: An American, being shown the new Moscow subway, says,
``Beautiful station, but where are the trains?'' The Russian
replies, ``And what about your lynchings?''
</P>
<P>
   But in Stepashin's labored version, the punch line was
translated as ``And aren't Negroes being killed in America?'' It
bombed. So did all his other bungling attempts at lightness and
charm. (Didn't work for New York City Rudy Giuliani either on his
madcap visit to Arkansas.) If you're a cop, try to be a nice cop,
but not a comedian.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Stepashin about the idea of removing Lenin from his tomb
in Red Square and burying him in a regular cemetery. Moscow sources
say that Yeltsin wants to do this because he could then use the
ensuing demonstrations by Communists, infuriated at any desecration
of their shrine, as an excuse to ban the party before next summer's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin straddled: he thought Yeltsin would not do that, but
he personally felt an argument could be made for burial one day.
``I would like the Communist Party to disappear and become the
Zyuganov party,'' the prime minister said, referring to the current
head of the Reds. ``Orthodox communism is unconnected to human
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the phrase ``human values,'' adopted to win friends in
the West, seemed incongruous coming from this hard-eyed enforcer of
Kremlin decrees. When asked by NBC's Andrea Mitchell if the
surprise move of Russian troops into Kosovo's main airport showed a
lack of Kremlin control over its military, Stepashin the Cop
reverted to type: ``That subject is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the real Stepashin, more refreshing than the fake. Here's
my advice to ``the semya,'' as fearful Russian apparatchiks refer
to the family propping up Boris Yeltsin, who flexes his muscle by
hiring and firing prime ministers. It applies to Stepashin as well
as to New York's Hillary and Arkansas' Rudy: Cut the restyling,
unfocus the groups and what we'll see is what we'll get. Let Gore
be Gore, Hillary be Hillary, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This is not as goody-goody as it sounds. Rarely has there been
such a longing for trustworthiness and a contempt for pandering.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of popular cynicism, campaign-trail conversions are
easily mocked, but authenticity can be dressed up to sell.
Positions and personality traits that irritate a minority are
marketable to the majority as characteristic of character.
</P>
<P>
   You have August to work it out. I'll be back after Labor Day.

GENERAL'S APPOINTMENT REFLECTS NATO'S CHANGING MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG and STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's decision to name Air Force Gen.
Joseph Ralston as NATO commander was a historic victory for the Air
Force and reflects the theory that future NATO military engagements
will rely on air power, military experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The post has been held by a four-star U.S. Army general during
NATO's 50 years except for the appointment of Air Force Gen. Lauris
Norstad by President Eisenhower in 1956. The NATO commander's
mission during the Cold War was to make plans to defend Europe
against a potential massive Soviet ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   Former Air Force leaders said the appointment of Ralston,
currently the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was an
acknowledgement that NATO's future wars likely will resemble the
11-week conflict in Kosovo earlier this year when the 19 members of
NATO relied on air power, .
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how Ralston's nomination to the NATO post will
fare in the U.S. Senate, which must confirm him for the job.
Ralston's acknowledgment in 1997 of a past adulterous affair
sparked political opposition to his planned appointment as chairman
of the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Ralston ended up
withdrawing his name rather than undergo Senate hearings and a
floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   His selection for the NATO post sparked enthusiasm among his
supporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest deal for the Air Force from a personnel
standpoint in the last 30 years,'' said retired Air Force Lt. Gen.
Buster Glosson, the architect of air operations during the 1991
Persian Gulf War. ``I can't think of a bigger deal. That is the No.
1 commander job in all of the world, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment reflects that air-dominated wars ``are
significantly more likely to occur'' than land wars as NATO maps
out the future, said Glosson.
</P>
<P>
   Led mainly by U.S. air crews, the NATO attack in the Balkans was
designed to force Yugoslavia to end a repressive campaign against
ethnic Albanians who lived in its southern province of Kosovo. The
alliance didn't send ground forces into Kosovo until after Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic announced he would withdraw his forces
from the province.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Merrill McPeak, who as Air Force Chief of Staff in
the early 1990s unsuccessfully fought to have an Air Force officer
as NATO commander, called Ralston's appointment ``a major
breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is all the more unusual because Ralston, a
native of Hopkinsville, Ky., didn't attend the Air Force Academy,
in Colorado Springs, Colo., a training ground for senior officers.
He graduated from Miami (Ohio) University in 1965 and entered the
Air Force through the Reserve Officer Training program.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the easy way to get to the top,'' said McPeak.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot who has logged over 2,500 flying hours in F-4s, F-16s
and F-15s, Ralston flew 147 combat missions over Laos and North
Vietnam. Other assignments have included a stint as the Air Force's
top official in charge of training and equipping all active-duty
combat squadrons.
</P>
<P>
   His medals include the distinguished flying cross and the legion
of merit.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston's appointment will become effective next May after the
departure of Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who commanded NATO's conflict
against Yugoslavia and whose term Cohen cut short by two months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clark and administration officials often sparred over
the course of the Balkans' conflict, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart insisted Wednesday that the Army general was not being
punished.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Lockhart said, Clark was being let go early to make room
for Ralston, who must leave his current Pentagon post by early next
year. By law, Ralston must get a new four-star position within 60
days or retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is being pushed out, no one is being forced out,'' said
Lockhart. ``The president has the highest regard for Gen. Clark. He
did incredible and invaluable work in the Kosovo conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen praised Clark Wednesday and
attributed his early replacement to a matter of timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked for the same qualities that Gen. Clark had in serving
in his capacity as commander as the European forces,'' said Cohen.
``I see the same qualities in Gen. Ralston, namely diplomatic
skills, his ... war record as such and the capability of serving in
that capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also praised Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's done a great job at a time when NATO was asked to
do something that it had not done for 48 years, which is to carry
on an active military operation,'' said Albright.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Clark pushed a reluctant White House to prepare
for a possible ground war. At the same time, he was criticized by
some Air Force officers for barring low-level bombing runs and for
not allowing pilots to aggressively attack the full breadth of
Yugoslav targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost nobody rallied behind Wes Clark. He was a lonely
commander out there and took hell from all sides,'' said McPeak.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Ralston had been the leading candidate for the
chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation's top
military position. But he was passed over after acknowledging his
involvement in an adulterous affair in the mid-1980s that surfaced
as the Air Force was embroiled in the fate of the service's first
female B-52 bomber pilot, 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn, who was prosecuted
for an adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen tried to draw a distinction between Flinn's and Ralston's
cases and argued that Ralston's affair did not disqualify him for
the post.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston supporters argued that Flinn faced a court-martial,
while Ralston did not, and that she had disobeyed an order to end
her affair and had lied about it. Ralston did not.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen reasoned that Ralston had an affair with a civilian when
he and his wife were separated, and that Ralston had no troops
under his command at the time. Cohen said Ralston did not hurt
``good order and discipline,'' unlike Flinn who was having an
affair with an enlisted Air Force woman's civilian husband.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism from women's groups and some members of Congress
led Ralston to ask that his nomination not go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Wednesday that Ralston's earlier problems would
not bar his appointment to NATO. And Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday that he
backs Ralston in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have my support,'' said Warner.

SENATE DROPS FEINSTEIN'S BAN ON IMPORT OF HIGH-CAPACITY AMMUNITION
CLIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Wednesday accused
``anti-gun control forces'' of using ``dastardly'' parliamentary
maneuvers to block her legislation banning the import of
high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   The California Democrat had succeeded in folding into the Senate
Juvenile Justice bill her legislation that would prohibit the
importation of foreign-made, high-capacity magazines that hold more
than 10 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said these high-capacity clips are used with firearms
developed by the military for killing large numbers of people in
close combat. She said they have no use in hunting or self defense
but have become fatal instruments in the hands of high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   She cited the example of the April massacre at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., in which one of two student shooters
used a high-capacity magazine, resulting in the gun-shot deaths of
13 children.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein expressed outrage Wednesday on the Senate floor after
discovering her ban on the magazines had been stripped away last
week from Senate crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something rather dastardly has happened to it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation, which was approved in May, is designed
to crack down on juvenile crime, with a handful of gun control
provisions attached. These include a requirement for instant
background checks on all sales at gun shows and a requirement that
safety devices be sold with all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   A similar House bill contains none of those provisions, although
efforts at negotiating a compromise are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein blamed ``anti-gun control forces,'' for a
parliamentary maneuver known as a ``blue-slip challenge,'' that
knocked her provision out of the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the House argued that because the importation
of high-capacity clips generates revenue for the treasury _ in the
form of a 4.2 percent tariff on some of them _ banning these
imports would cost Americans money and therefore means the Senate
Juvenile Justice bill is actually a tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   However, under the Constitution, ``all bills for raising revenue
shall originate in the House.'' And because the provision
originated in the Senate _ and since the House Juvenile Justice
bill contains no matching ban on the import of high-capacity clips
_ the Senate bill became illegal as long as it contained
Feinstein's provision. So, Senate Republican leaders were compelled
to take it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plainly, we were sideswiped and given no time to recover,''
Feinstein said of the last-minute maneuvering. She said the
parliamentary challenge was a ``cynical maneuver'' and ``an attempt
to further delay the will of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to name the House members who challenged her
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein pleaded with House and Senate negotiators who will
hash out a compromise Juvenile Justice bill between the two
chambers to reinsert the ban on the import of high-capacity
ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Will those who claim to support reasonable,
limited, targeted regulations on firearms finally put their money
where their mouths are, or will they continue to use unprecedented
parliamentary maneuvering to avoid the issue and give the National
Rifle Association its very own Christmas in July,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the House voted unanimously to approve a measure
similar to Feinstein's legislation, but it was upended when the
larger gun control bill it was attached to failed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Powers, an NRA spokesman, said Feinstein is wrong in
thinking that banning the importation of ``a piece of metal and a
spring,'' will curb crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she had her way, she would ban (all firearms,)'' Powers
said. ``She would go around to Mr. and Mrs. America and pick them
all up.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers said semi-automatic firearms have been around for more
than 200 years and are used in competitive shooting events,
including in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Powers also denied the NRA was involved in stripping Feinstein's
provision from the bill. ``We don't make the rules, Congress
does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Feinstein spearheaded the passage of legislation that
banned American companies from manufacturing semi-automatic assault
weapons and high-capacity clips that hold more than 10 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   But a loophole in that law allowed the high-capacity clips to be
imported. Last year, more than 11.4 million of these clips were
approved for importation into the United States from 17 different
countries, according to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

STUDY OUTLINES PRACTICE OF GIVING VOTERS GIFTS PRIOR TO ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ One in every three Mexicans who cast ballots
earlier this month in a crucial election won by President Ernesto
Zedillo's governing party now say they received groceries,
scholarships, crop payments or other government handouts before the
vote, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of those who received the gifts voted for the
party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, carried out in the state of Mexico, where the party
won the governor's race on July 4, is one of the first measurements
of the influence that government aid programs are having in
elections in a period when reforms have made outright ballot theft,
a common tactic in the past, almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders say the PRI has used government resources to
buy votes not only in the elections in the state of Mexico, but
also in elections in Guerrero, Tamaulipas and other states. The
votes are seen as dry runs for presidential balloting next year.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was carried out during the third week of July by Mori
International, a private, independent firm. The state of Mexico, a
sprawling region of industrial suburbs and hardscrabble farms
surrounding Mexico City, is the country's most populous, with 13
million residents, and like the federal presidency, its statehouse
has been controlled by PRI governors for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Montiel, the PRI candidate, was elected governor with 41
percent of the vote. But the two losing candidates, from the
center-right National Action Party and the center-left Party of the
Democratic Revolution, insist that the PRI's overwhelming use of
government resources on behalf of its candidate made the election
unfair. They have joined forces to carry out continuing protests.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Lund, who directed the Mori survey, said he decided to
study the state of Mexico elections after noting before balloting
for governor last year in Guerrero that the government was
systematically using state-financed aid programs to persuade
farmers, students, housewives and other poor people to cast ballots
for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we call pork in the United States,'' Lund said.
But the PRI's power to deliver government aid to constituents is
extensive because the party has held presidential power since the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over the world, there's an advantage to incumbency,'' Lund
said. ``But the powers of an incumbent are far greater for a party
that's been in power for seven decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Reta Martinez, a PRI spokesman, acknowledged that during
the state of Mexico elections there were numerous complaints about
local governments handing out food, building supplies and other
gifts to buy votes. But he said all three parties had engaged in
the same vote-buying practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the cleanest elections that we've had,'' Reta
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Duran, the National Action candidate, who finished
second, with 34 percent of the vote, denied that any cities
controlled by National Action had used municipal programs to buy
votes, although he conceded that the party had distributed baseball
hats and T-shirts bearing the party insignia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its not accidental that 80 percent of the people who said in
this poll that they received government aid said they voted for the
PRI,'' Duran said.
</P>
<P>
   Persons interviewed for the poll identified nearly a dozen
distinct forms of government aid that the pollsters concluded were
used to persuade voters to back the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Both in Guerrero and in the state of Mexico, Lund said,
scholarship payments were delayed for two months, with checks
finally delivered to parents of poor students just before the
balloting, often as PRI members made copies of parents' voting
credentials. The government also delayed delivery of farm payments
until just before the balloting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more effective in garnering votes was the delivery of
groceries to poor families, selected from detailed lists of
low-income households compiled by a government anti-poverty agency,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This practice was widely documented by journalists. In the
working class Mexico City suburb of Ecatepec a week before the
elections, a neighbor working for the PRI knocked at the door of
Maria Garcia Romero, a young mother, inviting her to visit a nearby
home serving as the party's neighborhood headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving away groceries,'' the party worker told Mrs.
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Garcia waited in line behind other neighbors, PRI
workers gave her a bag of sugar, oil, eggs and other foodstuffs,
wrote down her name and address from her voting credentials and
took her photo, Mrs. Garcia told a reporter.

SAN FRANCISCO _  DELTA  _ One of the hottest spots for summertime

Delta, 1,000 miles of tributaries. With a big social scene full of

 What's For Dinner? Hire a Personal Chef   By Tara Duggan 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  First, the gods of food technology bestowed upon
us the TV dinner. Then there was Lean Cuisine, its foil packets
glistening like astronaut food. Today, you can get organic
Sichuan-style string beans in the freezer case. All this
convenience makes you wonder if the homemade dinner will make it
very far into the next millennium.
<P>
   It may _ but cooked by others. As Americans opt for quicker
solutions to eating, the answer for many is personal chefs. They
arrive, knives and groceries in hand. Surprisingly, many of these
personal chefs can cook a homemade dinner for less than the cost of
a meal at Denny's.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike private chefs, who are usually associated with the
wealthy, personal chefs do not live in your home. Instead, they
visit your kitchen as frequently as you want, cook for a few hours,
and stock the refrigerator and freezer with homemade meals _
complete with reheating instructions. They'll even wash the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm with a partner, I enjoy cooking a meal as a way of
spending the evening together,'' says Martin Marks, who pays
personal chef Rachel Stewart $20 per meal to come to his home and
cook for him once a month. ``But as a single person, there's no way
I'm going to shop, cook, serve it, and clean it up just for myself.
I don't have that kind of time. No, I don't make that kind of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meals prepared by personal chefs range from $7 to $20 per
person. Price depends on location _ the Bay Area tends to be on the
high end _ and the number of meals you order. Chefs are flexible
with meal preparation, but usually have a minimum service of 15 to
20 meals per month.
</P>
<P>
   Some personal chefs prefer to work in professional catering
kitchens and deliver the just-made food, others work in clients'
kitchens but seldom spend more than five hours there. ``Chefs work
in their clients' home in order to provide a more personalized
service,'' says David MacKay, executive director of the United
States Personal Chef Association. ``Like I always tell the chefs,
`if you get a customer who wants chitlins, you best get the pig
boiling.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since personal cheffing is such a new concept, many potential
clients are reluctant to have strangers come into their home and
cook for them. To help assure potential clients, to provide
references and to try to instill an accepted set of standards for
the chefs, David MacKay and his wife, Susan Titcomb, started USPCA
in Albuquerque in 1991. The organization also gives independent
chefs a professional affiliation. In 1992, the organization
registered 15 members. Today, there are more than 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   USPCA also offers certification training for its members. Rachel
Stewart, who trained American Express employees for 13 years before
becoming a personal chef, recently led one such seminar for eight
aspiring personal chefs in her San Anselmo home.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the seminar ranged from a San Francisco pastry chef
who had had enough of the grueling pace of restaurant work to a
Turlock rancher who was looking for something to do after raising
her kids. During the two-day seminar, Stewart lectured her students
on issues such as food safety, business planning and marketing. She
also supervised the students' preparation of a few recipes
developed by the USPCA to work well when made ahead of time and
then refrigerated or frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Robfogel, who started a personal chef company called A Zest
for Life in Oakland last October, says it's difficult getting new
clients not to think of their service as an unaffordable luxury.
``The other day I delivered this meal to a customer who said at
first that the service was too expensive for them,'' Robfogel
explains. ``But after she and her husband ate it, they loved it so
much they decided to order three meals a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cost, customers tend to worry about the fact that
some of the meals are frozen. But Robfogel's partner, Heidi
Hornikel, a Culinary Institute of America-trained catering chef,
develops recipes that work well in the freezer. For example, they
offer an apricot-stuffed pork chop with braised mustard greens and
potato gratin. Or there's Armenian stuffed cabbage with homemade
marinara sauce and steamed green beans and baby carrots.
</P>
<P>
   A Zest for Life meals usually cost between $15 and $18 per
person. This price tag results from an insistence on using organic
vegetables and top-quality, free-range meats whenever possible,
Robfogel says. ``The quality of the ingredients is very important
to us, which I guess is why we're on the pricier side. But everyone
has a different way of measuring the value of their time. For the
most part, the convenience is really worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The USPCA estimates that more than 30,000 people nationwide now
use personal chefs. Despite this rise in popularity, there are
relatively few personal chefs in the Bay Area. The USPCA has 35
members registered in the Bay Area _ as opposed to 80 in Los
Angeles _ although many personal chefs work independently. But with
its glut of chefs and its food-loving population, the Bay Area may
become a prime market for personal chefs of the next millennium.

 Pudding the Berries in Bizou's Summer Dessert   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Loretta Keller first tasted Summer Berry Pudding
when she was the chef at Stars Cafe in the 1980s. She fell in love
with the way it showcased the abundance of berries at the height of
the summer season. So when she left to open Bizou, she adapted the
recipe for her own use.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pudding has a dense, berry-saturated texture that you don't
find in most versions of this dessert. She first cooks the berries
until they begin to break up. Then she soaks the bread in the
juices and layers it with the berries in a glass or ceramic mixing
bowl. The top is then gently pressed for up to 24 hours with a
three-pound weight, so the mixture becomes dense and heavy with the
syrup.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to serve, the pudding can be unmolded for an
impressive presentation _ a wonderful ending to a summer meal.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bizou, 598 Fourth St. (at Brannan Street), San Francisco; &LR;

SECRETS OF SUCCESS: &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; _ Pressing the pudding. &LR;  By weighting the pudding in its bowl, the
bread becomes saturated with berry juices and the flavors deepen
and meld.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Adding cassis. &LR;  This black currant liqueur adds a vibrant
note to the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; BIZOU'S SUMMER BERRY PUDDING
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 pints strawberries, rinsed, hulled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   5 pints raspberries
</P>
<P>
   5 pints blackberries
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cassis liqueur
</P>
<P>
   1 loaf  &LR; pain de mie  &LR; or Pepperidge Farm sliced white bread
</P>
<P>
   Whipped cream for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the strawberries, lemon juice and sugar in a large
saucepan. Place over medium heat and cook for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the raspberries and blackberries and cook until they begin
to break up. Stir in the liqueur. Remove from heat and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   Taste for a balance of sweet and sour. If necessary, add more
sugar or lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To form the pudding:  &LR; Cut off the crust from the  &LR; pain de mie, &LR; 
then cut the loaf in half lengthwise. Slice each half into
1/8-inch-thick slices. If using Pepperidge Farm bread, simply cut
off the crusts and cut each slice in half.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the cooked berries to a shallow pan. Dip enough
half-slices of bread into the berry juices to line a glass or
ceramic mixing bowl. Using a slotted spoon, add some berries to the
bowl. Continue layering dipped bread and berries into the bowl
until the pudding comes 2 inches from the rim of the bowl. Place a
piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding. Set a flat
plate on top and place a 3-pound weight on the plate (use a large,
heavy can of food such as tomatoes, or use a plastic container
filled with water). Place the bowl in a baking pan to catch any
drippings.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate the pudding for 18 to 24 hours, until set.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, remove the weight and plastic wrap, and either unmold
the pudding onto a serving plate, or spoon the pudding into
individual bowls. Garnish with dollops of softly whipped cream, or
pass the cream at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.

 Decadent Chocolate Sauce Rates Lip-Smacking Raves  &HT;        By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Where there's ice cream, chocolate sauce isn't far
behind.
<P>
   Today's panel tasted a total of 11 sauces, but limited the
tasting to those labeled hot fudge or chocolate sauce. Chocolate
syrups were not included.
</P>
<P>
   All of the sauces were heated in the microwave and stirred
before serving. They were served individually in cups as well as
with vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors went to  &UR; Susan Elaine's Incredibly Decadent Fudge &LR; 
 &UR; Sauce &LR;  (9.75 ounces, $5.99 at Andronico's). Two panelists described
it as ``classic American'' chocolate sauce. One thought the vanilla
flavor was too strong, but others liked the balance. Three would
buy it, one might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Second best was &UR; Chocoholics Semi-Sweet &LR;  (10 ounces, $4.99 at
Andronico's). Some described the flavor as burnt. But three
panelists liked the chocolate flavor. Four would buy it, one would
not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mrs. Richardson's Hot Fudge  &LR; (16 ounces, $1.99-$2.79 at many
supermarkets) came in third. One panelist thought it was too thick
and sticky, but others liked the fudgy texture. Two panelists also
thought it was too sweet, but two others liked the balance. Three
would buy it, one might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hershey's Chocolate Shoppe Fudge Topping &LR;  (16 ounces for
$1.99-$2.59 at many supermarkets) scored only two points lower than
Mrs. Richardson's. Two panelists described the texture as more like
caramel than chocolate, though most liked the flavor. One dissenter
disliked the overly sweet taste, however. Three would buy it, one
might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Whole Foods Dark Chocolate Sauce  &LR; (10
ounces, $4.99 at Whole Foods). Two panelists described the flavor
as cheap tasting, but another thought it had good balance of sweet
to bitter. One would buy it, two might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Smucker's  &LR; (11.75 ounces, $1.99-$2.49 at many supermarkets)
came in sixth. Two panelists described the texture as pasty. One
panelist didn't like the sauce on its own, but thought it was good
on ice cream. One would buy it, two might buy it, and two would
not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Fran's, The Silver Palate, Smucker's Dove,
Narsai's and Wagner's, but they scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna
Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland
Passot chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park, and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati,
San Francisco. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

 CHRON  
 Those Little O's Awarded FDA Label of Approval   By Kim Severson 
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  If you were surprised by recent ads linking
Cheerios and cancer prevention, you weren't alone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what industry observers call a victory over strict
restrictions placed on food advertising by the Food and Drug
Administration, the maker of cereals like Cheerios, Total and
Wheaties earlier this month won the right to claim the products
might help fight heart disease and some cancers. Print and
television ads pushing the message hit within days.
</P>
<P>
   The fight began when General Mills asked the government for
permission to state on some product packages that eating a low-fat
diet high in whole-grain foods may reduce the risk of heart disease
and certain cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Foods rich in dietary fiber can already make certain health
claims on packaging. But General Mills cited a 1989 conclusion by
the National Academy of Sciences that whole grains mix other
important nutrients with fiber and thus are disease-fighting, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration accepted that conclusion, and
paved the way for makers of foods containing 51 percent or more
whole grain ingredients by weight to start advertising the health
link.
</P>
<P>
   Not all foods sold as whole-grain products necessarily provide
the benefit, so check the label. The first ingredient listed should
be a whole grain, such as ``whole grain oats,'' ``whole grain
wheat'' or ``whole wheat.''

Grape Expectations
</P>
<P>
   Think the world needs more seedless grapes? Government
scientists in Fresno do.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers with the 76-year-old United States Department of
Agriculture grape breeding program announced earlier this month
that they have cuttings from three new varieties available for
growers and breeders. They expect the new grapes to hit the market
in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa, a new white seedless grape, yields large, sweet fruit.
Program geneticist David Ramming says these grapes ripen in about
the same time as Thompson seedless but the vines produce good-size
fruit without being sprayed with a growth regulator _ a common
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The new Summer Royal black seedless grapes are sweet, large and
firm, making them ideal for snacks and salads. And they fill a
production gap at the end of August, when there are usually no
American-grown black seedless grapes on the market, Ramming says.
</P>
<P>
   The third variety, called a summer Muscat seedless grape, is
designed especially for raisin producers. It's easy to candy-coat
because it's seedless. Most raisin grapes have seeds that have to
be removed mechanically, making the raisins sticky and hard to
process.
</P>
<P>
   The Fresno breeding program, best known for developing Red Flame
seedless grapes, has been testing some of new varieties for as long
as 18 years in the San Joaquin Valley.
</P>
<P>

Shape Up, America
</P>
<P>
   We're getting fatter. According to a report released last week
at the American Medical Association's annual meeting in Chicago, a
third to half of adult American women are overweight, and nearly
one-fourth are clinically obese.
</P>
<P>
   National studies suggest that 14 percent of children and 12
percent of adolescents are overweight. The American Academy of
Pediatrics' committee on nutrition has established obesity as the
top problem in child health.

 CHRON  
 Sturdy Varietals Distinguish the Delta   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Wine grapes like moderation. If it's too hot,
grape sugars soar and acids drop. If the temperatures are too cool,
sharp acids dominate and grape sugars are shy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   California's Central Valley is not the best place for
cool-climate white varieties like Chardonnay. But the sturdier
Chenin Blanc, and a handful of other wine grapes, mature nicely
with balanced acids and sugars in cooler parts of the hot Central
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The best site for wine grapes in this vast region is the Delta,
a wetlands that lies roughly between the Sacramento Valley _ the
upper part of the Central Valley _ and the larger southern Central
Valley, also known as the San Joaquin Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly triangular in shape, bordered by the San Joaquin and
Sacramento rivers, the Delta consists of a network of small
islands, many of which are home to the region's small wine-grape
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chenin Blanc and Petite Sirah do well here because, while
daytime temperatures are warm, the nights and early mornings are
tempered by maritime influences from the San Francisco Bay.
Clarksburg and Merritt Island are the two AVAs (American
Viticulture Area) known mainly for Chenin Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle and R &AMP; J Cook, both located in Yolo County, are the only
two wineries in the Clarksburg AVA. Bogle is a major grape supplier
to other wineries throughout the state and also makes its own wines
although, ironically, not Chenin Blanc, as the grapes were pulled
out to plant more Chardonnay. Smaller than Bogle, R &AMP; J (Roger and
Joanne) Cook still makes a Clarksburg Chenin Blanc, among other
wines, including a white and red Delta blend.
</P>
<P>
   Although other grape varieties are grown in the Clarksburg part
of the Delta, winemakers throughout the state favor the clean,
honeyed melon flavors and bright citrusy acidity of Clarksburg
Chenin Blanc. Dry Creek Vineyards, Baron Herzog and Weinstock
purchase Clarksburg Chenin Blanc grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Further east is the Lodi AVA, with main vineyards between
Sacramento and Stockton. Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc and some
other grapes are grown in the area, but Zinfandel is the star. Lodi
Zinfandels are known for ripe berry flavors and an earthiness that
adds depth and complexity. Noteworthy brands include Lucas Winery,
Pierano and Las Vinas. Mondavi-Woodbridge winery, known for quality
value wines like Zinfandel, is one of the largest wineries in the
region. Sonoma's Kenwood bottles a Lodi Zinfandel and Sebastiani
produces its Vendange wines in a winery near Woodbridge.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The Kosovo Liberation Army has taken
sweeping political control in Kosovo, establishing a network of
self-appointed ministries and local councils, seizing businesses
and apartments, and collecting taxes and customs payments in the
absence of a strong international police presence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a peace agreement that calls for an administration
appointed by the United Nations and the fact that the ethnic
Albanian militants have no legal standing, they have created a fait
accompli. These days they talk not of ceding power to the United
Nations but of cooperating as if they were equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work with the United Nations,'' said Muje Gjonbalaj,
who acts as the deputy minister for reconstruction and development,
``but this is our country and our government. We are in charge
until the elections, when a permanent government will be
installed.''
</P>
<P>
   The KLA's swift move to take power has been aided by the
squabbling and ineffectiveness of the moderate opposition, along
with a disorganized U.N. administration that is short on personnel
and awaiting the police member countries promised to send to help
maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator in Kosovo, said
he was aware of the abuses being committed by the KLA, and insisted
that the organization was working to curb them.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is planning to deploy a 3,100-strong police
force, although it has only 156 officers in Kosovo at the moment.
Kouchner, who has been criticized by U.S. officials for moving too
slowly, said he is working to set up legal mechanisms that will
sort through issues such as property ownership and taxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always like this after wars of liberation,'' he said.
``Things take time. What we want to avoid is an internal war. Some
of these activities are carried out by the KLA, others are carried
out in the name of the KLA. But we must work with them to establish
law and order. It will take more than 10 days. It was exactly the
same in my country when the British, the Americans and the
Canadians liberated France.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening in Kosovo is not just liberation from Serbian
rule, but a revolution. The ramifications for Kosovo and the
international powers that have set up a NATO protectorate, are
immense. The raw, often unschooled fighters have as their political
patrons the government of Albania and seem to care little for the
civilities of western-style democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has been rising steadily, especially against the
remaining pockets of Serbian civilians. The looting and burning of
Serb homes, as well as dozens of assassinations and kidnappings of
Serbs and a few Albanians, including the massacre of 14 Serbian
farmers on Friday, speak of a province spinning into the kind of
gunslinging and anarchy that has characterized Albania in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only political group that has any structure is the KLA,''
said Baton Haxhiu, the editor of Koha Ditore, an Albanian-language
daily. ``It is using it to take power, backed eventually by a
police and a National Guard force it alone will control. It will be
very hard to turn Albania into Kosovo, but I expect very easy to
turn Kosovo into Albania. Each day it is becoming more dangerous to
think and speak independently.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel fighters, who are supposed to turn in their weapons
before the end of September to the NATO-led peacekeepers, have been
slow to comply with the demilitarization agreement and are hiding
large stocks of weapons, NATO officers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Prizren on Friday, German soldiers uncovered a cache of 10
tons of ammunition squirreled away by the KLA. There is an average
of one murder a day, most often of a Serb, and three or four
lootings and house burnings in Prizren, which is in many ways a
typical city in postwar Kosovo. In Prizren, as in most towns in
Kosovo, the city hall and municipal buildings have been
commandeered by the KLA. Former fighters sit in the offices and run
the city.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina several large buildings have been taken over by the
group and turned into ministries. Small cafes, shops, apartments
and the huge shopping center in Pristina are in the hands of KLA
members.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these new entrepreneurs come from rural areas and have
nothing but disdain for the Albanian urban elite, who, they say,
failed to drive away the Serbs under Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, the nonviolent political leader of a faction of Kosovar
Albanians, remains in exile in Italy after a brief visit to Kosovo,
saying he has delayed his return because of concerns about his
security in KLA territory.
</P>
<P>
   Hetem Hetemi, who said he led a unit of 20 KLA fighters in the
war, most from his immediate family, was seated outside his new
business, the Mozart Bar, seized from its Serbian owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sons and I showed up in Pristina with our weapons and
decided to take this bar,'' he said. It was a point of pride to
Hetemi that one of the enemy, a paramilitary leader known as Arkan
who has been indicted on war crimes charges, used to drink at the
bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we had in our village was destroyed,'' Hetemi said.
``I took a Serb car but the KFOR soldiers stopped me and made me
give it to them. What am I supposed to drive? These peacekeepers
are worse than the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The provisional government is headed by Hashim Thaci, a KLA
commander who has appointed himself prime minister and his friends
and relatives to head various departments, including his uncle,
Azem Syla, to the post of defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci's orders are usually delivered by small bands of sunburned
young men, many of them carrying concealed pistols. They are handed
over with warnings that a failure to comply will lead to beatings
or death.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci says he will govern Kosovo until parliamentary elections,
which are expected to be scheduled sometime during the next nine
months. But he does not speak of disbanding the structures that
have been set up to allow the United Nations to assume
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   There is no deadline for elections _ local elections may precede
parliamentary or regional votes _ meaning that Thaci could be in
power for more than a year before any vote is organized by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under Thaci, the large ministries here hum with activity. In the
lobby of the old social security building in Pristina, now the
rebel movement's Defense Ministry, groups of wiry young men sat
huddled at their desks over coffee cups and dented tin ashtrays
filled with cigarette butts.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel commanders, many with pistols tucked in shoulder holsters,
moved in conversation up and down the central spiral staircase.
Newly minted bureaucrats with fancy titles _ and late model sedans
and jeeps, all parked outside and curiously lacking license plates
_ barked orders and passed out documents with ``The Defense
Ministry of Kosovo'' stamped across the top.
</P>
<P>
   The reach of these newly formed institutions is increasingly
felt in the streets and neighborhoods, where most people say they
are afraid to run afoul of the self-appointed authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Tahir Canolli, 49, a heavy-set man with a deep baritone voice
and the soothing, obsequious mannerisms of a salesman, ran a
furniture store in Pristina for nearly three decades. He bought his
couches, chairs, dressers and tables from a furniture factory near
Nis, and doggedly fended off Serbian tax inspectors, who visited
frequently with demands for money. He, like many businessmen, hoped
that when he returned to Pristina from the refugee camps in
Macedonia, such harassment would end.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a group of KLA fighters arrived at his shop two weeks
ago with a paper issued from ``The Ministry of Public Order''
demanding the keys to his 1990 Audi 80 and his store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were arrogant, brutal and rude,'' he said, unfolding the
stamped order that he now carries in his pocket. ``They told me
that if I did not comply immediately they knew a cellar I might
like to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worse than Enver Hoxha,'' he added, referring to the
former Stalinist dictator of Albania who died in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, $50,000 worth of furniture was loaded onto trucks
brought by the officials who had demanded his keys. The looters not
only stripped the store of its contents but also ripped out the
heaters, lamps and mirrors. They carted away 24 large flower boxes
that had been outside the building. The next day several flower
boxes of the same design and with the same plants were placed
outside the building where Thaci works.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci's appointees said that such confiscations, especially of
state-owned buildings, were part of their effort to determine
property ownership. They also defended the decision to begin
collecting money from local businesses, a practice many shop owners
have labeled ``extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If mistakes are being made they will be corrected,'' said
Gjonbalaj. ``There were many irregular contracts. We need to
regulate things in Kosovo and this means collecting taxes, or
contributions, rather, to rebuild. We are the legitimate government
and we must assume all governmental responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Canolli has spent hours outside Thaci's ministries in recent
days in the hope that he can reclaim some of his property or be
compensated for it. But each attempt has been rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the KLA police inspector who gave me the confiscation
order driving my car, although it had no license plates,'' he said.
``I went to his office but was told at the door that I should never
come back or attempt to speak with him. I am afraid. I survived
Serb occupation to be destroyed by my own people.''

 Old Time Dressing Goes Tropical   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  As part of a meal, salads are rarely memorable.
But they can be. If you make salads as carefully as you would an
entree or dessert they can add verve and freshness to a simple
dinner.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the idea that salad can be made by tossing a hodgepodge
of ingredients in a bowl then calling it a day. I've included some
basic rules for making salads that should ensure good results.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, before the advent of commercial salad dressings,
everyone cooked their own creamy-style dressing. The Hawaiian
Dressing recipe I've included today, from Helen Brown's ``West
Coast Cookbook,'' is in that vein. It is very good on tropical and
some summer fruits.
</P>
<P>
   The range of salad possibilities is almost endless. Remember,
your best tool when cooking is to taste everything as you are
making a recipe. Trust your palate.

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Here are step-by-step rules for salad-making.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discard any blemished, yellowed, limp or wilted leaves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rinse all fresh, raw ingredients under cold running water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dry all rinsed greens. Salad dressings won't adhere to wet
leaves. Dry the greens with paper towels or cloth towels, or use a
salad spinner. It works just like the spin cycle on your washing
machine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store greens in a plastic bag, adding a damp towel (wet the
towel and then wring it out) to the bag. Leave a little head space
before closing the bag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vary your salads by trying different greens, either by
themselves or in combination. Try small spinach leaves, watercress,
red oakleaf and small amounts of fresh herbs like basil or fennel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't put the dressing on a tossed green salad until you are
ready to serve it.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are making a salad of cooked ingredients, you may add
the dressing earlier so it penetrates the ingredients and fully
flavors the salad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; HAWAIIAN DRESSING
</P>
<P>
   This is very good over slices or cubes of mango, pineapple or
pear. Preparing it is a good learning lesson because you have to be
careful not to overcook it. It only takes a couple of minutes, so
don't turn away from the stove for any reason while you are making
this.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup pineapple juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup salad oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup white wine vinegar or cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sugar, salt, mustard and cornstarch in a 11/2- to
2-quart saucepan. Stir to mix well. Add the pineapple juice, salad
oil and vinegar; stir to blend thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the heat to medium and, using a whisk or a spoon, stir
constantly. In a couple of minutes the mixture will become slightly
thickened. Watch carefully. As soon as the mixture thickens and
changes from a cloudy light color to a translucent clear light
color, remove from the heat. If you overcook the dressing, it will
separate and become lumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into a jar and let cool completely before using.
</P>

 CHRON  
 The Baltic Transcends Time   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  When the Baltic, a historic bar-restaurant in
Point Richmond, has a boisterous night with jazz, drinks and food,
it might seem a quiet time compared to some of the goings-on here
earlier in this waning century. And when the restaurant experiences
a rare lull _ say, at 6:30 on a Monday night _ the scene might seem
lively compared to another brief period in its past. Because at one
time fairly early in its 95-year existence, the place was a
well-patronized bordello, and for a few years in the '30s, it was a
funeral parlor. Before, after and in between, the sturdy Victorian
brick building was an adjunct to the adjoining old firehouse, which
has since moved across the street, served as city hall and, during
Prohibition, housed a speakeasy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may have had a few other personae as well, but exact dates
are hard to come by. It is documented that the Baltic was initially
a tavern built four years after the Santa Fe Railroad established
its western terminus in 1900 in what was to become Richmond,
ferrying passengers to and from San Francisco across the bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltic's checkered past has one constant: the bar, says
current co-owner (with chef/partner Charles Wise) Paula Helene. The
bar _ a great period piece in dark wood with an enormous back
mirror, brought over from an even older San Francisco establishment
in 1904 _ has its firm place in local lore and documented history:
Jack London mentions it in one of his books, and a brass plaque in
the comfortable bar room attests to its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Helene, a New York-born singer/entrepreneur, acquired the
establishment in 1993. She added an eclectic mix of musical
entertainment (rhythm and blues, jazz, rock and flamenco) three
nights a week; she initiated a new period, capitalizing on a
well-planned combination of old and new that's reflected in
everything from the decor to the menu and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The room is decorated with dark wood-paneling, a high dark green
ceiling and green-cloth covered tables topped with white butcher
paper. The main dining room has a comfortable, if slightly worn,
old-time feeling. The well-protected, heated patio holds planters
with country-garden flowers and thriving herbs, which are put to
good use in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Wise, a graduate of Johnson &AMP; Wales' culinary program, also
hews the line between tradition and 1990s sensibilities: He
presents such late-century favorites as tempura shrimp, fresh
mozzarella with prosciutto and basil, confit of duck ravioli,
vegetarian capellini and grilled salmon with mango salsa.
</P>
<P>
   But he also dishes up food that wouldn't have startled Baltic
tavern patrons 90 years ago: oysters on the half shell, creamy
mushroom soup, a mixed grill (pork loin, duck breast, halibut) and
a seared flat-iron steak draped over a mound of fluffy mashed
potatoes and anointed with a rich gravy. Maybe the shiitakes in the
gravy wouldn't have been there, but it's still a plate full of
nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect harking back to earlier times are the large
portions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to leave hungry,'' says owner/entertainer
and sometimes waitress Helene as she puts a mountainous,
whipped-cream-topped slice of praline ice cream pie (house-made, of
course) in front of a diner.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE COOL STORY BEHIND THE HEAT WAVE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, August 1.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON When the top story nowadays, often as not, turns out
to be the mid-summer heat wave that has scorched much of the
nation, you know that we're also enduring a slow news cycle.
Reports of persistent temperature records are coupled with the
opinions of presumed experts on the meaning of changing weather
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Dehydration that stems from extreme heat can prove fatal. But
doctors have long recognized that sweltering temperatures should be
properly seen as one of several contributing causes to death
whenever other serious medical problems are also present.
</P>
<P>
   The real story of the Big Boil of 1999 is not how many people
have been subjected to the heat but rather how many millions have
all but escaped its full impact in temperature-controlled houses,
offices, cars and malls.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three in four American homes are air conditioned.
Houston, the nation's fourth largest city, plans to spend over $750
million this year just to keep cool. It's a good investment: In
1900, only some 45,000 people lived there, sweltering each summer
by the Texas Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   Like television, air conditioning has been around for much of
the 20th century. A year after earning a master's degree in
electrical engineering from Cornell in 1901, Willis Carrier
patented a unit that soon came to comfort the very comfortable,
much as private jets do today.
</P>
<P>
   But the broad middle class had to wait several more decades for
its turn. And, by and large, poor people, among whom a good deal of
heat-related suffering occurs, are still unable to obtain relief.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Hollywood made a movie, ``The Seven Year Itch,'' based
on the premise of a ``bachelor'' who sends his wife and kids to the
beach for the entire summer to escape their sultry apartment,
thereby setting up his sultry escapade with Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager living in a hot and humid New York City in the
1940s, I'd escort my future wife to a ``healthfully chilled'' movie
house on summer weekend afternoons. There we'd cool off, sitting
through two feature films, cartoons, newsreels and coming
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   As grown-ups in 1970, we bought a house from a partner in a
regional movie chain. When building the house in 1949, he mounted a
nine-ton water-circulation tower by the driveway, utilizing the
same crew and much the same gear that served his movie emporiums.
</P>
<P>
   At first all went well _ once we had found a technician who
could decipher the various dials, valves and switches needed to run
the massive commercial-grade apparatus. But then came the oil shock
of the mid-1970s and the sticker shock of soaring electricity
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw came when the power company's chieftain wrote to
inform us that we'd been chosen for a ``special study'' by dint of
being among the utility's top 100 residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   Our over-engineered ``movie'' air conditioning system _ more
powerful than even the pioneering one Carrier installed in 1922 at
Graumann's Metropolitan Theater in Los Angeles _ had to go.
</P>
<P>
   In its place came a heat pump, a bunch of fans and utility bills
appropriate to a journalist's salary. They aren't newsworthy, but
they'll help us get by until the fall.

THERE'S NO FERRY GODMOTHER TO SOLVE SAN FRANCISCO CAR CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUSSELL LONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For many years, Americans _ particularly
American environmentalists _ have had a love affair with the ferry
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do ferries relieve roadside congestion (as well as
nerves frayed from sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic), but
conventional wisdom says ferries also reduce air pollution by
getting us out of our gas-guzzling cars.
</P>
<P>
   While this may have been true 25 years ago, when automobile
engines produced far more pollution than today, ferries have
escaped tough scrutiny and Clean Air Act requirements for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, boosters perpetuated the myth of their
cleanliness. The result? Most people still think ferries are as
environmentally friendly as Tall Ships on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Abetting this illusion is our romantic view of seafaring craft.
</P>
<P>
   Often graceful and sleek, many ferry boats seem part of the
wondrous ocean itself.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's first vehicle, they continue to capture our
imaginations. We name them, just as we do our children, and we are
willing to spend small fortunes to maintain them.
</P>
<P>
   Similar romantic notions are almost certainly diverting the
high-powered mayors and other members of the Bay Area Water Transit
Task Force, currently pushing their proposal for the world's
largest ferry service through the California Legislature with
wake-jumping alacrity.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $2 billion system would bring 120 huge,
5,000-horsepower catamarans operating at speeds of up to 50 mph
into a spider web of routes around the San Francisco area, starting
as early as 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, despite good intentions to reduce traffic
congestion, the task force has so far neglected to study air
pollution and safety impacts. Had members done so, they would have
discovered that even the most modern ferries are 10 times more
polluting per passenger than recently built cars, and 34 times more
polluting than the natural-gas bus designs proposed for Golden Gate
Transit.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: California automobiles have become far cleaner in
the past quarter-century, emitting only 6 percent of the
smog-forming pollutants they used to. Buses have also become much
cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Ferries use a dirtier type of diesel fuel than do buses. The
boat engines spew massive amounts of cancer-causing particulates
and sulfur emissions into densely populated urban shorelines often
inhabited by low-income and racially diverse constituencies. The
task force has not yet addressed these problems of environmental
justice.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Harbor Safety Committee, a government group
replete with marine industry experts, has expressed concerns,
citing the increased risk and danger of collisions with other
vessels, possibly leading to an oil spill in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Windsurfers, kayakers and fishers should also be worried about
collisions. It's difficult for a high-speed ferry skipper to spot
small craft when spray is hitting the windshield at 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed ferry service goes forward, it will be a lot
harder to enjoy peace on the bay, especially on foggy days, knowing
you could instantly become sushi when a ferry confuses you with a
whitecap. Freighters and cruise ships have a 15-mph speed limit for
a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to air pollution and safety problems, high-speed
ferries would also create large wakes that erode shorelines,
causing damage to sensitive wetlands and wildlife habitat and
endangering threatened mammals such as sea lions.
</P>
<P>
   Their engines will dump cancer-causing dioxin into the ocean.
The craft will create significant noise pollution and diesel fumes
that will annoy marine enthusiasts and shoreline residents,
destroying one of the last truly peaceful natural areas in the
region. To paraphrase Lewis Mumford, adding a high-speed ferry
system to relieve road congestion is like loosening your belt to
lose weight. While it might make you feel better, it makes no
sense, especially if it means destroying our environment, too.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A quarter-century ago, when Richard A. Rosenblatt was
first developing his skills as a trader on the floor of the New
York Stock Exchange, it was widely predicted that the Big Board's
days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed commissions were banned in May 1975, plunging Wall Street
into a frenzy of competition for customer trades. As trading fees
shrank, dozens of less efficient brokerage firms closed their
doors. With member firms dropping away, the price of an exchange
seat even dropped as low as $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenblatt's eyes shine when he remembers those fearsome
days. ``For a young entrepreneur, the opportunities just
exploded,'' he said. With prices suddenly within his reach, he was
able to borrow money and buy a seat on the exchange in 1979; it
became the cornerstone of the institutional trading firm that bears
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Today, skeptics are once again predicting the demise of the Big
Board. Its trading floor in lower Manhattan is no match, they say,
for the new computer-driven systems that are attracting a growing
share of the trading that traditionally has been done on the
exchange and its archrival, the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, Rosenblatt is optimistic. ``This game is for the
New York Stock Exchange to lose,'' he said confidently last week,
on the eve of the exchange's confirmation that it hopes to
transform itself into a for-profit corporation with public
shareholders before the end of the year. ``They've got it _ they've
got a better product for the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the New York exchange and its chief executive,
Richard A. Grasso, search for a survival strategy, Wall Street's
central symbol faces a daunting array of challenges. The exchange
must protect its franchise and find a way to blend the best aspects
of its floor-based auction system with the speed and the capacity
that only computers can provide. It must become more cost-efficient
without becoming less careful about policing its business _ a
challenge of such public importance that Arthur Levitt, chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, warned Grasso earlier this
week that regulatory competence will be the make-or-break issue
when the commission reviews his plans.
</P>
<P>
   And, as a public company, the Big Board must figure out how to
make money doing all this _ enough money to placate potentially
impatient shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt has a personal stake in how well the exchange fends
off its new competitors. ``I need an environment where I can make a
difference to my customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Big Board has lost only about 5 percent of its
trading volume to the electronic communications networks, or ECNs,
that have gobbled up nearly 30 percent of the Nasdaq market's
volume.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping a grip on its primary business is likely to be more
of a challenge for the Big Board in the future than it has been in
the past. In recent weeks, the New York exchange has liberalized
its Rule 500, which prevented companies from withdrawing from the
exchange without their shareholders' approval. Now, companies can
withdraw merely by obtaining the approval of their independent
directors.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind this change was that more companies would be
willing to list on the Big Board in the first place if it was
easier for them to leave. But the practical effects may simply be
that it is easier to move elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Another bellwether is the fate of Rule 390, which requires
members of the exchange to trade all Big Board stocks that were
listed before April 1979 only on a registered stock exchange, most
likely to be the Big Board itself during the hours the exchange is
open.
</P>
<P>
   The rule now affects only about a third of the Big Board stocks,
its supporters point out. But if this rule falls _ and the Nasdaq
market has been muttering for years about challenging it _ the New
York exchange could soon find that more of its trading volume has
moved to other markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board's fabled liquidity _ a volume of trading so deep
that large blocks of stock can be traded quickly without a dramatic
impact on prices _ is a key element of its premier ``brand.'' A
migration of trading volume to competing trading systems would not
only reduce its revenues, it would also undermine the value of that
brand.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical issue _ the real dollars-and-cents issue
for the Big Board,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law
professor at Columbia University and a member of the legal advisory
committees for both the Nasdaq market and the Big Board. ``It's a
key part of their franchise, and I cannot see them liberalizing it,
especially as they move to become public.''
</P>
<P>
   But Benn Steil, a senior fellow for foreign economic policy on
the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, argues that the
elimination of Rule 390 would simply increase the healthy pressure
on the exchange to create a trading structure that people want,
rather than one they are required to use.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Big Board may have no choice but to live
without the protections of Rule 390. ``I can't imagine that it can
remain in place,'' he said. ``It is such an anomaly, with so many
competitive pressures arguing against it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable speculation that the New York exchange
will be able to increase revenues by making strategic acquisitions
_ perhaps buying one of the upstart ECNs, or purchasing one of the
for-profit stock exchanges that are proliferating abroad, or buying
a company that develops innovative software for trading services.
</P>
<P>
   But for the near-term, the Big Board will most likely make its
money the old-fashioned way: by charging fees for companies to list
on the exchange and for investors to trade there. And in today's
competitive environment, both listing fees and trading fees ``are
going to be under competitive pressures,'' Steil said.
</P>
<P>
   To cope, he said, ``they need to bring their costs down.''
</P>
<P>
   Steil believes that cost pressures in competition will force the
exchange to abandon the expensive trading floor _ a trading
environment that Rosenblatt insists is the symbol of the exchange
and ``the envy of the world'' _ and replace it with an electronic
trading system.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt disagrees. ``You don't want to automate the
auction,'' he insisted, arguing that the relationships and
reputations of individual floor traders allow them to get better
prices for their customers. ``But you sure want to automate
everything around it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Either option requires money, of course. And the need to pay for
swift and dramatic improvements in technology will increase the
pressure on the Big Board to curtail its other costs.
</P>
<P>
   And that raises questions about whether the exchange will be
able to produce profits for its new shareholders and still
adequately pay for its self-policing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that already faces the for-profit ECNs that elect
to compete with the Big Board and the Nasdaq market by becoming
full-fledged stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allow the ECNs to become exchanges, regulating
themselves, you are inevitably going to have scandals,'' Coffee
said. Under pressure to produce profits, the for-profit exchanges
may well ``start to shop for the cheapest and the least, shall we
say, `intrusive' regulator,'' he continued. ``If that trend
accelerates, you've got a race to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt, the SEC chairman, wants to prevent that race from
starting.
</P>
<P>
   He offered one suggestion in his first response on Monday to the
idea of allowing for-profit stock trading entities: ``More formally
separating the self-regulatory role from the role of exchanges as
trading venues.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what the National Association of Securities
Dealers is planning if it proceeds with a proposal to spin off the
Nasdaq market as a for-profit corporation early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the scheme that Grasso outlined for the exchange
last week. Instead, he envisions retaining the exchange's
regulatory operation within the new for-profit company.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee worries that in-house regulators would be vulnerable to
cost-cutting pressures. His concern is shared by James J. Needham,
a former SEC commissioner who was the first paid chairman of the
New York Stock Exchange, from August 1972 to May 1976.
</P>
<P>
   With for-profit exchanges, ``there is the potential for serious
conflicts of interest,'' Needham said. ``We cannot rely on
self-regulation anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Don, a securities lawyer in Chicago with wide experience
in advising newly public companies, was less concerned about an
erosion of regulatory efforts. ``You just have to have sanctions
sufficiently strong that noncompliance becomes uncompetitive
behavior,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, the veteran floor trader, has heard the various
arguments, and said that he did not think members of the exchange
care where the regulators hung their hats. ``We just care that
regulation is not so cumbersome that you can't function, and that
regulators understand the difference between jaywalking and
premeditated murder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Needham, the former New York exchange chairman, said that the
changes in ownership structure now being contemplated by the Big
Board and the Nasdaq market are so dramatic that the SEC ought to
hold public hearings before approving either proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing would be for the public to lose confidence
because they don't understand what's happening,'' Needham said.
``Before we take the next step, let's find out what we're really
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, staring down at the unstylish side-laced shoes that
cushion his feet during long days on the trading floor, wondered
aloud whether anyone could truly assess where the changes of today
will leave the markets of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone to think that, five years from now, any of us will
be doing business the way we do today would be dangerously naive,''
he said. ``You show me a better way to trade, and I won't trade one
more share on the NYSE. But nobody's shown me that yet.''

GREATEST FOOD POISONING DANGER ZONE: THE HOME KITCHEN
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: Has sider, EGG-SAFETY (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Food poisoning made headlines this summer when 58 North Texas
young people returned from a drill team camp with stomach-churning,
serious E. coli infections.
</P>
<P>
   The incident rekindled consumer fear that arose five years ago
,when tainted hamburgers traced to a fast-food restaurant chain
killed four children in the Seattle area. Some mothers still forbid
their children to eat hamburgers because of that tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, another E. coli scare caused the recall of 25
million pounds of hamburger patties, and in November, 1.5 million
pounds of hot dogs and cold cuts were pulled from the market.
</P>
<P>
   Although large outbreaks of food-borne illness generally grab
national attention, the more menacing food-poisoning threat lies
closer to home, experts say _ in your kitchen. Most food-borne
disease originates in the home and is caused not by food but by
what we do with food, says Joan Horbiak, a food safety expert with
the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is getting worse, says Horbiak, even though a few
preventive measures would go a long way toward curbing the rise of
in-home cases of food-borne illness. Those incidents _ caused by
insufficient cooking; inadequate refrigeration; cross-contamination
from germs on raw foods, hands, cutting boards, platters and
cooking utensils; and food sitting out at room temperature for too
long _ rose by 25 percent over the past five years, Horbiak says.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate
that 9,000 people die of food poisoning each year; up to 33 million
contract food-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say 6.5 to 33 million cases each year, because so many
people have it without knowing what it is,'' Horbiak says. ``We are
slow to equate the `summer bug' with mishandling of food, but often
flulike symptoms including fever, chills and nausea, especially
during warm weather, are actually symptoms of food poisoning. When
you have an outbreak at a restaurant, it's headline news. When
people get sick at home, nobody stops to figure out why.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the rise in home-related food-poisoning incidents, the
dietetic association recently launched a three-year campaign to
teach consumers how to prevent food poisoning in their homes and at
family picnics, especially during the hot summer months when
reported incidents increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteria grows like crazy at higher temperatures. If it's 80
degrees outside, you've got to get your picnic fare back into a
cooler within one hour,'' says Horbiak, national spokeswoman for
the new campaign, ``Home Food Safety ... It's in Your Hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside an air-conditioned house, you have a two-hour window,''
Horbiak says. ``Every 30 minutes, bacteria doubles. Refrigerating
promptly is one of the biggest things you can do to protect
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers tend to think food safety is complicated, that it's
out of their hands, but it's not. We are emphasizing four simple
steps. There are a million tips out there, but these four can have
a great impact, and they are quick and easy,'' Horbiak says.
</P>
<P>
   The tips:
</P>
<P>
   Wash hands often.
</P>
<P>
   Keep raw meats and ready-to-eat food separate.
</P>
<P>
   Cook to proper temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate leftovers promptly below 40 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds simplistic, but 50 percent of food-borne illness
could be prevented if we washed our hands more,'' Horbiak says.
``People rinse, they don't wash. They don't use soap and they don't
take enough time. You should wash for 20 seconds. Time counts.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI BOX
</P>
<P>
   The American Dietetic Association's new home food-safety
campaign aims to help people realize that food-borne illness is a
serious problem, with simple solutions that take only seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is funded by a grant from ConAgra, one of the
largest food companies in the world, representing brands including
Healthy Choice, Butterball, Act II, Orville Redenbacher's, Peter
Pan, Swiss Miss, Hunts, Wesson, Armour and Swift Premium.

PASTEURIZATION TOUTED AS ANTIDOTE TO SALMONELLA DANGER
</HEADLINE>
 EDS: This is a sider to FOOD-POISONING 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunny side up, over-easy or scrambled, hard-boiled or soft and
runny, even raw in milkshakes, eggnog and Caesar salad dressing, we
eat more than 70 billion eggs in this country each year.
</P>
<P>
   If even one in 20,000 has a little salmonella bacteria on the
shell or inside the egg (from a virulent strain that infests the
chicken's ovaries and is passed on in the egg before it is ever
laid), a lot of people can get sick.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the home front and food safety, though, news on
the egg is encouraging, thanks to measures by the federal
government to improve food safety practices and private efforts to
pasteurize the egg.
</P>
<P>
   First, new labels warning that eggs ``may contain harmful
bacteria known to cause serious illness, especially in children,
the elderly and persons with weakened immune systems'' are proposed
for all egg cartons, effective Aug. 27. The warnings, proposed by
the Food and Drug Administration, state:
</P>
<P>
   ``For your protection, keep eggs refrigerated; cook eggs until
yolks are firm; and cook foods containing eggs thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Services also announced this month a new federal
requirement that all eggs and egg products packed for consumers be
refrigerated at 45 degrees or below. Distribution warehouses and
transport vehicles as well as supermarkets, restaurants, delis,
caterers, vending operations, hospitals, nursing homes and schools
fall under the regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Cooling and cooking eggs properly ``may prevent up to 66,000
illnesses and 40 deaths per year,'' according to the directive
issued by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   The warning labels and refrigeration requirements are among
measures promised by President Clinton to improve food safety in
this country. The President's Council on Food Safety is developing
a strategic plan, due Nov. 1, to improve the safety of eggs in the
shell and processed egg products.
</P>
<P>
   But a more promising development in egg safety may be a new
pasteurization process that has been developed that eliminates the
threat of salmonella from whole eggs in their shells without
changing their texture, appearance or taste.
</P>
<P>
   John Davidson, president of Pasteurized Eggs L.P., the company
that developed the new process, says whole pasteurized eggs will be
available along the East Coast from Boston to Washington, D.C., in
October and nationwide early in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look, cook and taste exactly like nonpasteurized, but
they are completely safe,'' Davidson said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pasteurization makes eggs as bacteria-free as fresh pasteurized
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Ultrapasteurized and homogenized liquid eggs have been available
for years in containers that look like milk cartons, and are widely
used in restaurants for omelets, custards, quiche, dressings and
sauces. These liquid eggs, sold under the brand name Easy Eggs,
work well scrambled, but cannot be prepared ``sunny side up'' or
even ``over easy'' because yolk and white are mixed in the
processing.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's eggs look like any other whole eggs and are sold in
the shell, by the carton. The whites can be separated easily for
meringue, and some of the yolks separated and omitted to lower
cholesterol in a particular recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hard-boil it, beat it, scramble it, fry it, nothing
changes,'' Davidson says. ``If you look very closely, the yolk of a
pasteurized egg is slightly larger than its counterpart, the
formation of the white doesn't run all over the pan when you fry
it, and before cooking, the white is slightly more opaque, but you
really have to look for the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar efforts involving microwaves and radiation have been
attempted in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The secret, Davidson says, is in heating the eggs enough to kill
bacteria without soft-boiling them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You apply heat to kill the targeted bacteria, in this case
salmonella,'' he explains. ``Government standards say to heat every
particle to the equivalency of 140 degrees for 3.5 minutes to
achieve destruction of any salmonella that may be present, but it
comes out soft-boiled if you do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we determined the equivalency at a lesser temperature for
a longer time. My process varies the amount of heat and the time
required in three separate steps.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he can pasteurize 1,000 cold eggs a minute, within
one-10th of 1 degree.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson says the processing is expected to add about 35 cents a
dozen to the price of eggs.

 CHRON  
 DELTA DINING: A Round-Up of Waterfront Restaurants That Offer  Good
Eats and Generous Drinks   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISO _  If you can dream it, you can do it. So says the
mantra about outdoor activities in California, where you can ski in
the morning and be at the beach before the sun sets.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the hottest spots for summertime fun is the
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, 1,000 miles of tributaries
cutting through the Central Valley from Sacramento down to Antioch
and Pittsburg. On weekends, boats of all sizes full of water
skiers, scurfers (a combination of surfing and waterskiing),
fishers and sun worshipers pack the waters from dawn to dusk.
</P>
<P>
   With that big of a social scene, it's no wonder that restaurants
have popped up at just about every marina. In fact, many
restaurants actually have docks specifically for those just coming
in for a bite to eat.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the best restaurants in the Delta? Well, hot day
dining isn't the same as four-star food, but we found 10 places
right on the water with menus ranging from well-prepared standards
like burgers and fries to more upscale options with a little style.
</P>
<P>
   While these places are all accessible by boat, they're also easy
enough to get to by car (most even have parking lots) so even those
who don't have boats can take part in the fun.

 &LR; ANTIOCH
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Humphrey's &LR; . This popular dining spot in Antioch has been open a
long time, but new owners took over four years ago. The decor
remains the same: huge windows overlooking the marina, lots of
mirrors, plastic swordfish and flowers for color. But the feeling
is comfortable and somewhat formal for the area, with servers in
tuxedo shirts and cummerbunds as well as food at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Appetizers are likely to disappoint, but since the entrees come
with soup or salad, potato or rice, and vegetables, they're
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The menu features mostly Italian-style food like thinly pounded
chicken piccata in a tangy lemon butter sauce and scampi with lots
of garlic. The spinach pasta primavera would have been better with
about a quarter of its smothering pesto-cream sauce, but the
addition of cauliflower, zucchini and carrots gave the dish a fresh
taste.

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Sugar Barge &LR; . Sugar Barge is an expansive restaurant with
outdoor seating and a casual menu on the rooftop, an
air-conditioned bar area and comfortable dining room. It's
decorated in Miami Vice tones of greens, pinks and blues, but it
complements the area.
</P>
<P>
   Many people consider the food in the dining room to be some of
the best on the Delta, but sometimes the kitchen cuts corners. The
rice pilaf served with entrees, for example, tasted suspiciously
like it came from a mix, and the cheese topping the Caesar salad
was waxy and cheap.
</P>
<P>
   But if you stick to the more casual menu of fried calamari and
burgers served on the rooftop patio, you won't be disappointed. And
be sure to order one of the frozen cocktails which come in colored
sugar-rimmed hurricane glasses with colorful straws.

<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Garlic Brothers &LR; . Garlic Brothers offers some of the best casual
food on the Delta. Diners have the option of dining under colorful
canvas umbrellas on the wood deck or in the industrial-looking
dining room with a concrete floor and colorful paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Fried calamari was some of the best we tasted, with a crispy but
not heavy coating and decent cocktail and tartar dipping sauces.
The quesadilla is big enough for two for lunch with cheddar,
Monterey jack cheese and grilled chicken between two tortillas
topped with wonderful roasted tomato salsa, guacamole and sour
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbo, something of a specialty here, sports a good balance of
heat to sweet flavors, and is packed with big chunks of chicken,
sausage and rock shrimp. Burgers, too, are a step above what you'll
find at other places. Here, they're served on focaccia bread that
holds up to the burger's juices. And the fries are terrific, too.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant also has a number of specialty cocktails,
including the Absolut Razz Monster, a pint-size glass filled with
vodka, raspberry liqueur, citrus juices and 7-Up _ cool and
refreshing on the hottest of days.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Garlic Brothers, 6629 Embarcadero Drive (near Benjamin &LR;   &LR; Holt),

<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Peta's Yacht Harbor Restaurant &LR; . It's hard to imagine wanting
hefty German food after a day of sweltering on the Delta, but the
food at Peta's is so good it can't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Thick split pea soup, for example, might be better suited to a
cold winter night, but there's no denying its exceptional flavor.
Sweetly-spiced sauerbraten and crispy wiener schnitzel are great,
too. Entrees are served with soup or salad, plus side dishes of
sauerkraut, vinegary warm German potato salad and slices of dark
pumpernickel bread. Nothing on the menu is over $15 and is even
less at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of this 19-year-old restaurant is dingy, filled
with dusty beer paraphernalia, but the outdoor patio is more
pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Peta's Yacht Harbor Restaurant, 445 W. Weber Ave. (near &LR; 
 &LR; Center Street), Stockton; (209) 941-8605. Lunch and dinner &LR;

 &LR; _ &UR; Wimpy's &LR; . Wimpy's is the king of nothing-fancy restaurants;
everything is nicely prepared and served in sparkling clean
surroundings. The front area looks like a diner with a long counter
with seating and vinyl booths. The main dining room is
wood-panelled and well-decorated with American flags, in case you
thought you were in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Try the crawdads when they're on the menu. They arrive piping
hot with a little plastic cup of cocktail sauce, lots of lemon
wedges and instructions on how to twist, crack and peel the
critters.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of DELTA 7- (96706 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  We suspect that some of the rest of the food begins with
ingredients from the freezer, but the final product can still be
good _ crispy fish and chips, and hamburgers in several forms
including a patty melt and a chili burger. Dinners include a lot of
beef _ chopped sirloin, chopped sirloin Mexicana, chopped sirloin
western, for example _ with a few chicken and fish options.
</P>

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Rio City &LR; . This restaurant on the river in Sacramento's Old Town
gets an A+ for creativity, even though the kitchen sometimes falls
short on execution.
</P>
<P>
   Appetizers include dishes we're used to seeing in the city (ok,
the  &LR; other &LR;  city), such as raw tuna, but here it's served as
``nachos'' tossed with wonton chips and a sesame-ginger dressing.
Grilled polenta studded with mushrooms has exceptional flavor, but
the dish is marred by too much of a balsamic vinegar reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Other dishes have flaws as well _ Caesar salad had lettuce with
brown spots, a wild rice pilaf was dreadfully undercooked _ but the
open, warehouse-size space is pretty and the wine list outshines
most others we saw.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Rio City Cafe, 1110 Front St. (near Neesham), Sacramento; &LR; 
 &LR; (916) 442-8226. Open lunch through dinner daily and brunch on &LR; 
 &LR; Sunday. Full bar. Reservations and credit cards accepted. &LR;   &LR; Street
and garage parking nearby. Entrees: $11.95- &LR;   &LR; $19.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1 &LR;   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Riverboat Delta King &LR; . Riverboat Delta King resides on an old
river paddleboat that also serves as a hotel. The decor is
well-kept, with upholstered chairs and booths and tons of gleaming
wood.
</P>
<P>
   The food is somewhat old-fashioned, but for the most part nicely
prepared. Caesar salad could be punched up with a bit more garlic
and anchovy, for example, but at dinner time, it's made tableside
which is a pleasant reminder of days gone by.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch includes dishes like decent portobello mushroom sandwiches
and crispy fries. Cioppino can be ordered at lunch or dinner and is
surprisingly good. The mild tomato broth tastes of sweet fennel and
the briny flavors of the seafood including salmon, calamari,
shrimp, mussels and clams.
</P>
<P>
   Skip dessert; you'll be happier stopping in one of the ice cream
or candy stores in Old Town.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Riverboat Delta King, 1000 Front St. (near K Street), &LR; 
 &LR; Sacramento; (916) 441-4440. Lunch and dinner Monday-Saturday; &LR; 
 &LR; Sunday brunch. Full bar. Reservations and credit cards &LR;   &LR; accepted.
Street and garage parking nearby. Entrees: $13.95- &LR;   &LR; $27.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Crawdad's Cantina &LR; . Crawdad's shares marina space with Chevy's
and Wood'ys  &LR; (sic) &LR;  Riverfront Grill, and the place is packed,
especially on weekends with diners and partyers. The space is
decorated in bright island colors, a little reminiscent of Islands,
a burger chain in Southern California. But most people head to the
enclosed patio which is simple and functional.
</P>
<P>
   The food here is better than much of what you'll find along the
Delta, except for the calamari which was tough and flavorless.
Appetizers include creative and well-made dishes like
coconut-coated shrimp in a spicy-sweet glaze. Sandwiches, like the
grilled portobello mushroom and the grilled chicken with
caramelized onions, come on big slices of focaccia bread instead of
boring buns.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of DELTA 7- (96706 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But don't miss the gumbo or the jambalaya, which are great and
fit the warm weather. You'll break a sweat with both, though the
jambalaya is the more mild of the two. Both are packed with
chicken, crawfish and shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Crawdad's also does a decent job with desserts, especially the
banana-coconut layer cake which sandwiches banana cream between
yellow cake and covers the whole thing in coconut.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Crawdad's Cantina, 1375 Garden Highway (near Interstate 5), &LR; 
 &LR; Sacramento; (916) 929-2268. Open lunch through dinner daily. &LR; 
 &LR; Full bar. Reservations for parties of 10 or more. Parking lot &LR; 
 &LR; and street parking. Entrees: $11.95-$14.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Wood'ys  &LR; (sic) &UR; Riverfront Grill &LR; . Wood'ys is located at the same
marina as Crawdad's, but up the embankment of the river, surrounded
by trees. The outdoor patio is naturally shaded from the blazing
sun but doesn't afford the same view of the Sacramento River.
</P>
<P>
   Food here isn't as good as Crawdad's, either. But the restaurant
does offer some mean cocktails including a Pain Killer _ dark rum
with lots of fruit juices in a super-sized glass usually reserved
for water.
</P>
<P>
   If Crawdad's is packed and you can't get into Chevy's, the menu
at Wood'ys has a lot of options. And after a Pain Killer, you might
not care that the fish tacos are dry and the barbecued ribs have no
flavor save the sauce itself. Plus, the prices are right. You can
put together a big meal for two for about $30.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Wood'ys, 1379 Garden Highway (off of Interstate 5), &LR; 
 &LR; Sacramento; (916) 924-3434. Open lunch through dinner daily. &LR; 
 &LR; Full bar. Reservations for parties of 8 or more. Credit cards &LR; 
 &LR; accepted. Entrees: $7.89-$14.99. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Jammin' Salmon &LR; . Jammin' Salmon may be the best kept secret in
Delta dining. The restaurant is located far enough down the
Sacramento River to be out of earshot of the bustling marina where
Crawdad's and Wood'ys are located. And that gives the place a
peaceful, almost romantic feel.
</P>
<P>
   The inside dining room is simply decorated in shades of yellow
and red, but as with most restaurants along the river, many diners
opt for the standard patio.
</P>
<P>
   The menu features an eclectic mix of food we've come to regard
as California-style, with influence from France, Italy and Asia.
Start with the jumbo steamed artichoke which arrives bathed in a
buttery broth studded with sweet fresh rock shrimp and tomatoes.
Grilled asparagus were good, too, but marred by clunky pieces of
thick-cut prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   For entrees, try the blackened ahi with a drizzle of wasabi
cream atop nutty brown rice or the grilled skirt steak with Asian
spices. Mushroom risotto is good, although soupier than more
traditional executions.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Jammin' Salmon, 1801 Garden Highway (near Interstate 5), &LR; 
 &LR; Sacramento; (916) 929-6232. Open for lunch weekdays, dinner &LR; 
 &LR; daily, brunch weekends. Reservations and credit cards accepted. &LR; 
 &LR; Parking garage. Entrees: $9.95-$14.95. &LR;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE COOL STORY BEHIND THE HEAT WAVE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, August 1.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON When the top story nowadays, often as not, turns out
to be the mid-summer heat wave that has scorched much of the
nation, you know that we're also enduring a slow news cycle.
Reports of persistent temperature records are coupled with the
opinions of presumed experts on the meaning of changing weather
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Dehydration that stems from extreme heat can prove fatal. But
doctors have long recognized that sweltering temperatures should be
properly seen as one of several contributing causes to death
whenever other serious medical problems are also present.
</P>
<P>
   The real story of the Big Boil of 1999 is not how many people
have been subjected to the heat but rather how many millions have
all but escaped its full impact in temperature-controlled houses,
offices, cars and malls.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three in four American homes are air conditioned.
Houston, the nation's fourth largest city, plans to spend over $750
million this year just to keep cool. It's a good investment: In
1900, only some 45,000 people lived there, sweltering each summer
by the Texas Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   Like television, air conditioning has been around for much of
the 20th century. A year after earning a master's degree in
electrical engineering from Cornell in 1901, Willis Carrier
patented a unit that soon came to comfort the very comfortable,
much as private jets do today.
</P>
<P>
   But the broad middle class had to wait several more decades for
its turn. And, by and large, poor people, among whom a good deal of
heat-related suffering occurs, are still unable to obtain relief.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Hollywood made a movie, ``The Seven Year Itch,'' based
on the premise of a ``bachelor'' who sends his wife and kids to the
beach for the entire summer to escape their sultry apartment,
thereby setting up his sultry escapade with Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager living in a hot and humid New York City in the
1940s, I'd escort my future wife to a ``healthfully chilled'' movie
house on summer weekend afternoons. There we'd cool off, sitting
through two feature films, cartoons, newsreels and coming
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   As grown-ups in 1970, we bought a house from a partner in a
regional movie chain. When building the house in 1949, he mounted a
nine-ton water-circulation tower by the driveway, utilizing the
same crew and much the same gear that served his movie emporiums.
</P>
<P>
   At first all went well _ once we had found a technician who
could decipher the various dials, valves and switches needed to run
the massive commercial-grade apparatus. But then came the oil shock
of the mid-1970s and the sticker shock of soaring electricity
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw came when the power company's chieftain wrote to
inform us that we'd been chosen for a ``special study'' by dint of
being among the utility's top 100 residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   Our over-engineered ``movie'' air conditioning system _ more
powerful than even the pioneering one Carrier installed in 1922 at
Graumann's Metropolitan Theater in Los Angeles _ had to go.
</P>
<P>
   In its place came a heat pump, a bunch of fans and utility bills
appropriate to a journalist's salary. They aren't newsworthy, but
they'll help us get by until the fall.

ALEXANDER LAUNCHES IOWA AD CAMPAIGN SNIPING AT BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Texas, Tenn.)  (bl) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander
began a last-ditch television advertisement campaign in Iowa on
Wednesday that attacks George W. Bush's fund-raising success
without mentioning the Texas governor's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``An auction is underway on the White House lawn,'' an announcer
says as the ad begins, just before the camera captures a group of
men, wearing Texas-style string ties, shouting out their bids.
``The nomination is going to the bidder with the most cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a former Tennessee governor, is staking the future of
his struggling presidential bid on a strong showing in the Iowa
straw poll to be held in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 14. The poll is not
binding, but it is an important early indicator of popular support
in the state where the nation's first presidential caucus will be
held in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the ad right now because voters are paying
attention,'' said Brian Kennedy, the political director of
Alexander's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, whose campaign has been beset by money woes all year,
is buying the commercials with $90,000 that he has in the bank and
the proceeds of fund-raising events held in recent weeks. Alexander
managed to raise $2.5 million in the first six months of 1999, and
has had trouble paying some bills. In May he was forced to make
deep cuts in his staff in Washington and in Tennessee. At the end
of June, Alexander reported that he had debts totaling $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Bush's Republican rivals have criticized the fact that
his campaign raised $37.3 million in just four months, a
record-setting sum that is more than the combined total amount
raised by the rest of the Republican field. But Alexander is the
first candidate to buy advertisements that suggest Bush is
attempting to buy the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After the scene on the White House lawn, Alexander appears on
the commercial to deliver the anti-Bush message that he has
repeated often in recent weeks on the campaign trail. ``The
presidency ought to be about raising children, farm prices and
standards, not just raising money,'' he says. ``I've been all over
Iowa because the presidency is too important to be bought or
inherited. It ought to be earned.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokesperson for Bush, declined Wednesday to say
whether the Bush campaign would broadcast advertisements in the
weeks leading up to the straw poll. But she suggested that voters
in Iowa will not be amused by Alexander's advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the grassroots supporters of Governor Bush
in Iowa will appreciate this kind of politics,'' Ms. Tucker said.
``We would hope that Lamar Alexander, and all the other candidates,
would join Governor Bush in running a positive, issue-oriented
campaign, rather than criticizing their opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander campaign officials refused to tell the cost of the
advertisements, which were shown for the first time Wednesday on
television stations in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Sioux City and the
Quad Cities area.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention in the advertisement of Bush or his
fund-raising prowess. But the point is clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Alexander's strategy is to focus on Iowa and talk
about the issues,'' Kennedy said. ``Governor Bush's strategy is to
break fund-raising records and not talk about the issues. He hasn't
even come to Iowa much.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, and strategists for several other Republican
candidates, said today that they hope to play upon a growing
resentment among Iowans that Bush and Steve Forbes, a wealthy
publisher, are spending big money to win the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is spending $10 million on radio and television
advertisements in Iowa and New Hampshire. The advertisements are
intended to introduce Forbes to the public. One ad shows Forbes
with his family. ``The real success in life is not the things we
often see in the news or read about in the history books, but the
seemingly mundane tasks of day-to-day _ getting kids up, getting
the homework done,'' Forbes says.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa radio spots, Forbes said that he hopes the August straw
poll ``can serve as a catalyst to get the candidates talking about
the issues.''

HEARST-ARGYLE REPORTS RESULTS FOR QUARTER AND FIRST HALF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc., announced Wednesday
that revenues for the second quarter grew 69 percent to $186.1
million over last year's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast cash flow grew 56 percent to $89.7 million, the
company said. After-tax cash flow rose 44 percent to $43.4 million,
or $0.49 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Income applicable to common stockholders before extraordinary
item declined 37.3 percent to $13.1 million, or $0.15 per share,
the company, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, revenues rose 52 percent to $299.5 million
and broadcast cash flow climbed 48 percent to $134.7 million.
After-tax cash flow grew 40 percent to $62.5 million or $0.85 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Income applicable to common stockholders before extraordinary
item declined 41 percent to $15.6 million or $0.21 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The results include the operations of the Kelly Broadcasting
Sacramento properties since Jan. 5 and the operations of the
Pulitzer broadcast group since March 18, the respective dates on
which Hearst-Argyle's acquisitions of those properties were
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced pro forma results as if it owned the
Pulitzer and Kelly/Sacramento properties at the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On a pro forma basis, the company's revenues for the quarter
declined 7 percent to $186.1 million. Broadcast cash flow for the
quarter declined 13 to $89.7 million. After-tax cash flow declined
16 percent to $43.5 million, or $0.47 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Income applicable to common stockholders declined 35 percent to
$13.3 million, or $0.14 per share.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, revenues declined 3 percent to $347.6
million. Broadcast cash flow declined 7 percent to $153.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   After-tax cash flow declined 9 to $74 million, or $0.80 per
share. Income applicable to common stockholders decreased 31
percent to $13.2 million, or $0.14 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors contributed the company's revenue performance in
the quarter, according to David J. Barrett, president and co-chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall demand was below expectations, depressing pricing and
rate yield, and we were not as successful as we expected to be in
replacing the $13 million of political advertising we received in
the second quarter of 1998,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Category spending for movies, General Motors and
telecommunications providers was also well below last year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our NBC stations were impacted by the unfavorable comparison
to the Seinfeld finale in May 1998, while ABC's sluggish ratings
performance impacted inventory pricing in the second quarter,'' he
said.

SANDERS TRAVELS TO LONDON _ AND OUT OF THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Sanders landed in London Wednesday. Paris and Amsterdam
are also part of his itinerary. Chances are he's not auditioning
for a job in NFL Europe, though he's now eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Lions' nonpareil, on the verge of becoming the most
prolific rusher in National Football League history, announced his
retirement Wednesday via a statement released through the web site
of his hometown newspaper, the Wichita (Kan.) Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My desire to exit the game is greater than my desire to stay
in it,'' said Sanders, the former Heisman Trophy winner from
Oklahoma State who has gained at least 1,000 yards in each of his
10 seasons with the Lions and needs 1,458 to break Walter Payton's
career record of 16,726. ``I have searched my heart through and
through and through and feel comfortable with this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but he seemed to treat it a bit awkwardly. ``I don't
know the right way to retire,'' the 31-year-old Sanders said upon
arriving at London's Gatwick Airport. ``This is just my way of
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, it's irrevocable _ for now, anyway. ``I'm going
into retirement,'' Sanders told English reporters before retreating
into seclusion, ``and I don't see my plans changing.''
</P>
<P>
   If they do, his address won't. Patriots fans _ including those
who already have called the club inquiring about how Sanders might
be lured to Foxboro Stadium _ can stop salivating. Though the
Patriots could dearly use a running back of his pedigree _ then
again, who couldn't? _ Sanders has no realistic alternatives to the
Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit placed him on the reserve: did not report list, not the
reserve: retired list. That means he can be activated any time
before Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barry comes back,'' said general manager Chuck Schmidt at a
news conference, ``we would like him to come back to the Detroit
Lions.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, assuming anything else would be sheer fantasy.
Declaring his retirement does not make Sanders a free agent; the
Lions retain his playing rights. And because of the six-year, $36
million contract he signed two years ago, the cost of moving
Sanders would be prohibitive. If the Lions traded or released him,
he still would count as $5 million against their salary cap, which
would mean they'd have to deal as many as a half-dozen veterans
just to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Sanders seems dead set against a return,
anyway. His statement began, ``Shortly after the end of last
season, I felt that I probably would not return for the 1999-2000
season.'' Toward that end, he had been incommunicado during the
offseason, skipping both mandatory and voluntary minicamps. When he
made up his mind Monday, his agents, David Ware and Lamont Smith _
with whom Schmidt had been in contact during their client's
self-imposed exile _ were unable to dissuade Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years is a lot of football,'' he told the London media.
``I'm just really not feeling like playing. It's just getting to
that point. It's not the same game. Really, I've been battling for
the last few years. As I've gotten older, the game has changed in
my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed is the Lions' lack of success _
they won one playoff game during Sanders's tenure, went 5-11 two of
the past three seasons, and do not loom as a viable contender in
the foreseeable future. That, along with disenchantment with coach
Bobby Ross, reportedly were factors in his decision, though he said
in his farewell statement, ``I truly will miss playing for the
Lions. . . . I have enjoyed playing for two great head coaches,
Wayne Fontes and Bobby Ross, who are good coaches and leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   However, as Sanders remained mum while the rumors swirled during
the offseason, his father, William, said, ``He's sick of (the
Lions). He's sick of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders told no one in the Detroit front office of his decision,
and at Wednesday's press conference, Ross refused to speculate
about the reasons for it. Its impact was another matter. ``I felt
there was the potential for a big play every time I lined up with
him,'' said the coach, ``and no matter who replaces him, that won't
be part of the feeling you will have on the sideline. Obviously,
we're very, very disappointed because we lose a great football
player.''
</P>
<P>
   To be precise, they've lost their offensive fulcrum, which was
why wide receiver Johnnie Morton said, ``It's a huge hole missing
right now. I think we're in a shock state of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Added quarterback Charlie Batch, ``I wish he would have given a
hint. He's got a lot of good years left in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who stood to be displaced by Sanders in the record book,
agreed with Batch's assessment and said he'd like to see Sanders
return someday.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Sanders was insisting otherwise. The only issue that
seemed to concern the accidental tourist was: Which side of the
road do you drive on?

 &HT;    Hispanic conference participants ask, ``Where's Bush?''
 &HT;    Moving in (w)Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore was the headliner at the
National Council of La Raza convention Wednesday, but conference
participants made it clear they had another presidential candidate
on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore addressed the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights
organization, many gathered at the Houston convention site wore
lapel stickers emblazoned with the day's looming question:
``Where's George?''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration among Hispanic leaders is growing over Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's failure to appear at the La Raza event and at
three other recent conferences held by Hispanic groups. Bush is on
vacation with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's call for a ``compassionate conservatism,'' his ability to
speak Spanish and his departure from the Republican party platform
on issues such as bilingual education have made him popular with
Hispanic voters in Texas. According to one widely-reported
estimate, he won 49 percent of that vote in his re-election bid
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But some Hispanic leaders warned this week that Bush, considered
the leading contender for the GOP presidential nomination, is
making a mistake if he thinks he's got their community's support
sewed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the governor's popularity with
Hispanic voters is real, but it is also fragile,'' said Lisa
Navarrete, spokesperson for La Raza. ``The question now is
substance. What is he going to talk about? What are his positions
on issues of concern to the community? We need to hear from him
about that and that's what we expected to hear from him at our
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gore and Bush, La Raza also invited Democratic
candidate Bill Bradley and Republicans Elizabeth Dole and Sen. John
McCain (R-Arizona) to the conference. McCain attended.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bush declined to speak at Unity, the
nation's largest-ever meeting of minority journalists. The meeting
was held in Seattle, Wash., where Bush was campaigning. He reversed
course, appearing at the last minute, but refused to participate in
a question-and- answer session, drawing vehement criticism from
journalists in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unity to Bush: You blew it,'' read the headline in the next
day's conference newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also declined recent invitations to address the League of
United Latin American Citizens and the National Association of
Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gonzalez, Washington, D.C. director for the Association of
Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, said he is still giving
Bush the benefit of the doubt. But he also voiced concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to believe that they're taking us for granted
already,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to hear about issues. How are we going to reduce the
dropout rate? What are we going to do about affirmative action,
bilingual education, restructuring INS?''
</P>
<P>
   The non-partisan group also invited Gore to speak at its June
meeting, an invitation he accepted.
</P>
<P>
   None of the presidential candidates accepted invitations to the
recent meeting of the League of United Latin American Citizens
(LULAC) in Corpus Christi, Texas. All but Pat Buchanan were
invited.
</P>
<P>
   Salena Walsh, the group's spokesperson, said Bush attended last
year's conference and met with LULAC officials in Austin in
February.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, she said Bush and LULAC leaders ``agreed to
disagree'' on school vouchers. Bush supports them, while LULAC
opposes vouchers. In addition, she said the group pressed Bush on
his qualified support for bilingual education. He says he supports
it if statewide tests show it works. They urged him to bone up on
the long-debated issue of granting amnesty to illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said LULAC leaders had hoped Bush would speak about his
stand on such issues at their conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still would like to hear more assertive responses to our
questions, questions that are of the utmost concern to the Hispanic
community,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, campaign officials say Bush is trying to accommodate
the host of groups inviting him to speak and that he is trying to
reach out to all voters. They point out that he recently met with
Hispanic leaders in Iowa and that he discussed issues such as
bilingual education and immigration on a Spanish-language public
affairs television program in California.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he is scheduled to deliver welcoming remarks at the
Urban League's annual convention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Henry Bonilla, (R-Texas), said he believes that
Hispanic voters at the grass-roots level are getting Bush's
message. And he urged voters to look at, ``the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's going after solid Republican areas to win
primary states,'' Bonilla said. ``Al Gore is hitting unions hard.
He's having fund raisers with trial lawyers and Hollywood types
because he has to work his base very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Bush officials acknowledge that the campaign has been
focused on ensuring primary support from its core _the vast
majority of which is conservative and non-Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a mistake, said William Boone, associate professor
of political science at Clark Atlanta University. He said Bush
should not underestimate the importance of symbolism when it comes
to winning votes across racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably something that bears rethinking by the Bush
campaign,'' Boone said. ``It can appear to be insensitive to the
needs of these people. And symbolic needs are just as important as
substantive needs in some instances.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush advisors are aware
of the criticism. She wouldn't say if it will make a difference
should Bush receive future invitations from Hispanic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's noted,'' she said of the criticism. ``The
governor's always looking for additional ways to reach out to the
Hispanic community. We're always going to give a serious look to
every invitation.''

 &HT;    Gore targets GOP tax cut and Bush at La Raza convention
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) political categories.
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Vice President Al Gore, capitalizing on the
controversial absence of Texas Gov. George W. Bush from the annual
convention of the nation's largest Hispanic organization, charged
Wednesday that Republican tax cuts in Congress would drain the
federal budget surplus and jeopardize programs that are popular
among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   And while he refrained from mentioning Bush by name, he made the
most pointed political jab yet at the Texas governor in suggesting
that the GOP presidential frontrunner is standing with fellow
Republicans in Congress in support of a ``risky scheme'' of tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, alternating comfortably between English and Spanish
throughout his keynote address to the National Council of La Raza
(NCLR), also highlighted some unflattering statistics on the plight
of Hispanics in Texas to underscore his criticism of the GOP tax
cut plan in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He said several times, for instance, that 24 percent of the
children in Texas have no health insurance, the second highest
percentage in the nation, and that more than half of the state's
uninsured children are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we care about all these children ... how could we even
consider taking this hard won surplus and just blowing it all on
schemes for special interest tax breaks,'' Gore said. ``And here in
Texas, the state with the second-highest percentage of uninsured
children in America, we need to question how any leader would
support such a risky scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Bush's campaign. The
governor is on vacation in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the budget surplus should be used to shore up Social
Security and Medicare and to meet ``urgent needs'' in education,
such as combating Hispanic school dropout rates _ ``not to blow it
on another round of Republican roulette'' that produced record
budget deficits under the Reagan and Bush presidencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential
nomination, also issued a veiled challenge to Bush to oppose his
party's attempts in Congress to prevent the use of statistical
sampling in the 2000 census in order to avoid the kind of
undercount of minorities that occurred in the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we possibly allow a census that last time undercounted
the Hispanic community by more than 5 percent and at a time when
the needs are greater, political aspirations are high and the need
for champions ... who can fight for you are even greater,'' he
said. ``Where is the leadership (in the Republican Party)?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made no overt pleas for support of his presidential bid to
the NCLR, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization established in 1968
to reduce poverty and discrimination against Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   But Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, in his introduction of the
vice president, underscored the political nature of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Spanish, Richardson noted that ``the governor (Bush)
did not make it here, ``in contrast to the vice president _ a man
who is on our side with a record and a passionate commitment to our
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson reminded the thousands of Hispanics attending the
conference that 90 percent of the Latino community is concentrated
in states that account for 80 percent of the 270 electoral votes
needed for election to the presidency: California, Texas, Florida,
New York and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year is going to set the political tone for the new
century,'' Richardson said. And with Hispanics expected to become
the largest ethnic minority in the country in the next century, the
next election could be ``the most important in the millennium and
in the history of Latino political development (in the United
States).''
</P>
<P>
   The NCLR's rank-and-file members generally agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is going to make things happen for Hispanics,''
said Oscar Noriega Jr., 28, a former migrant worker who now heads
the Idaho Migrant Council, a public interest group that helps
migrant workers with health care, child care and education.

 &HT;    Hispanic conference participants ask, ``Where's Bush?''
 &HT;    Moving in (w)Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore was the headliner at the
National Council of La Raza convention Wednesday, but conference
participants made it clear they had another presidential candidate
on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore addressed the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights
organization, many gathered at the Houston convention site wore
lapel stickers emblazoned with the day's looming question:
``Where's George?''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration among Hispanic leaders is growing over Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's failure to appear at the La Raza event and at
three other recent conferences held by Hispanic groups. Bush is on
vacation with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's call for a ``compassionate conservatism,'' his ability to
speak Spanish and his departure from the Republican party platform
on issues such as bilingual education have made him popular with
Hispanic voters in Texas. According to one widely-reported
estimate, he won 49 percent of that vote in his re-election bid
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But some Hispanic leaders warned this week that Bush, considered
the leading contender for the GOP presidential nomination, is
making a mistake if he thinks he's got their community's support
sewed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the governor's popularity with
Hispanic voters is real, but it is also fragile,'' said Lisa
Navarrete, spokesperson for La Raza. ``The question now is
substance. What is he going to talk about? What are his positions
on issues of concern to the community? We need to hear from him
about that and that's what we expected to hear from him at our
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gore and Bush, La Raza also invited Democratic
candidate Bill Bradley and Republicans Elizabeth Dole and Sen. John
McCain (R-Arizona) to the conference. McCain attended.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bush declined to speak at Unity, the
nation's largest-ever meeting of minority journalists. The meeting
was held in Seattle, Wash., where Bush was campaigning. He reversed
course, appearing at the last minute, but refused to participate in
a question-and- answer session, drawing vehement criticism from
journalists in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unity to Bush: You blew it,'' read the headline in the next
day's conference newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also declined recent invitations to address the League of
United Latin American Citizens and the National Association of
Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gonzalez, Washington, D.C. director for the Association of
Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, said he is still giving
Bush the benefit of the doubt. But he also voiced concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to believe that they're taking us for granted
already,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to hear about issues. How are we going to reduce the
dropout rate? What are we going to do about affirmative action,
bilingual education, restructuring INS?''
</P>
<P>
   The non-partisan group also invited Gore to speak at its June
meeting, an invitation he accepted.
</P>
<P>
   None of the presidential candidates accepted invitations to the
recent meeting of the League of United Latin American Citizens
(LULAC) in Corpus Christi, Texas. All but Pat Buchanan were
invited.
</P>
<P>
   Salena Walsh, the group's spokesperson, said Bush attended last
year's conference and met with LULAC officials in Austin in
February.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, she said Bush and LULAC leaders ``agreed to
disagree'' on school vouchers. Bush supports them, while LULAC
opposes vouchers. In addition, she said the group pressed Bush on
his qualified support for bilingual education. He says he supports
it if statewide tests show it works. They urged him to bone up on
the long-debated issue of granting amnesty to illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said LULAC leaders had hoped Bush would speak about his
stand on such issues at their conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still would like to hear more assertive responses to our
questions, questions that are of the utmost concern to the Hispanic
community,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, campaign officials say Bush is trying to accommodate
the host of groups inviting him to speak and that he is trying to
reach out to all voters. They point out that he recently met with
Hispanic leaders in Iowa and that he discussed issues such as
bilingual education and immigration on a Spanish-language public
affairs television program in California.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he is scheduled to deliver welcoming remarks at the
Urban League's annual convention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Henry Bonilla, (R-Texas), said he believes that
Hispanic voters at the grass-roots level are getting Bush's
message. And he urged voters to look at, ``the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's going after solid Republican areas to win
primary states,'' Bonilla said. ``Al Gore is hitting unions hard.
He's having fund raisers with trial lawyers and Hollywood types
because he has to work his base very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Bush officials acknowledge that the campaign has been
focused on ensuring primary support from its core _the vast
majority of which is conservative and non-Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a mistake, said William Boone, associate professor
of political science at Clark Atlanta University. He said Bush
should not underestimate the importance of symbolism when it comes

OBSCENE INTERNET ADDRESSES GRAB CONGRESS' ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Congressional hearing called to examine
intellectual-property and trademark issues on the Internet became
sidetracked Wednesday by questions about who was responsible for a
new flurry of obscene Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing by the House Commerce Committee's intellectual
property subcommittee brought together officials from the Commerce
Department and Network Solutions, a private government contractor
in Herndon, Va., that for years has held a monopoly on registering
Internet addresses, known as domain names, ending in .com, .net and
.org.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions has a long-standing policy against
objectionable or vulgar names. But this spring, the Commerce
Department authorized five other companies to begin competing in
the registration process. And Network Solutions, which continues to
administer the system, decided not to impose its rules on the new
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That decision has resulted in a rush of new domain name
registrations using obscene words.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, said the episode raised concerns
about the Commerce Department's ability ``to oversee how this
process should go forward and how well it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions said its decision was made after conversations
with the Commerce Department, which it said was aware of the
implications.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said it had discussed the matter with
the company only after Network Solutions asked if it would object
to the company's position of not censoring the new registrars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had, that would have raised serious First Amendment
questions,'' said Becky Burr, a senior Commerce Department official
who is overseeing transition of administration of the Internet from
government contractors to a new, international group, the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, known as Icann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer that there not be dirty words on the
Internet,'' Burr said after the hearing. ``But for the U.S.
government to be involved in that decision would raise serious
constitutional questions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Burr was clearly frustrated by the repeated focus on the issue
during the hearing, which was called to explore questions like
``cybersquatting,'' in which company names or other valuable words
are registered as Internet addresses and then resold for vast sums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we have bigger fish to fry,'' she said in reference
to a protracted stalemate with Network Solutions on the terms for
opening its business to full-scale competition.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock, on key issues like the rights to the vast database
the company has compiled on the ownership of more than 5 million
Internet addresses, has delayed plans for introducing competition.

 &HT;    Wall Street frowns on MindSpring
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Within a half hour after MindSpring Enterprise's
conference call to explain its earnings and future plans to
analysts Wednesday morning, its stock began a tumble that lasted
all day.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring closed at $35.50, down $4.75, a loss of almost 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the analysts downgraded the stock after Chairman and
Chief Executive Charles Brewer and President and Chief Operating
Officer Michael McQuary told them that future profits might be
sacrificed in the company's quest to reach 2 million subscribers
from its current 1.2 million by the second quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Departing from its aggressive acquisition model, MindSpring said
it would increase spending by $45 million to $50 million on a
marketing and advertising campaign, more than the 20 percent of
revenue it originally planned to spend. Brewer restated his desire
for MindSpring to ``break out of the pack and become a clear No.
2'' behind industry leader America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brewer told the analysts that if a good acquisition
opportunity came along he would take it, he indicated that
``organic growth'' was the plan for the immediate future, and that
MindSpring's profitable status _ rare in the Internet world _ would
be forfeited in the near term for that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport &AMP; Co. almost immediately downgraded MindSpring from
``hold'' to ``underperform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``MindSpring had been traded at a premium because they had a
profit and good control'' of their costs, Youssef Squali, an
analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co., told Bloomberg News. He still
rates the stock a ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is down because there's no takeover play,'' says
Jeff Sadler of FAC Equity in New York. Sadler still rates
MindSpring a ``buy'' but doesn't think MindSpring can cross the 2
million mark by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   He's also wondered why MindSpring didn't detail the marketing
plan for analysts during the call. Rival company EarthLink
undertook a similar plan earlier this year, but invited analysts to
its Pasadena, Calif., headquarters to explain how it would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the time to do this,'' Sadler says, ``and
they are probably six months late at that. EarthLink realized this
nine months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler also says MindSpring's failure to address how it will
keep its new subscribers is making investors nervous. The company
made no mention of building out its start page to keep users around
beyond the free trial period. ``It's like herding cattle,'' Sadler
says, ``Once you get them in you have to have a sturdy fence.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's aggressive spending plans to grow subscribers is
at odds with the June 24 announcement that the company was
considering ``various business combinations.'' Neither Brewer nor
McQuary would comment on possible acquisitions or partnerships. But
Brewer did not rule out the possibility entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still interested in acquisition,'' Brewer said, ``but
we plan to pursue an aggressive organic growth plan. It will have a
negative impact on income, but it will help us become a stronger,
more valuable company.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company would continue to exercise the same
financial discipline in its marketing and advertising ventures that
led the company to a string of five profitable quarters. The string
ended in the first quarter of this year, when the company began to
absorb the costs of acquiring the venerable California Internet
provider Netcom.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree MindSpring may have to spend money on
advertising and marketing to grow its customer base. However, there
are concerns the company won't be able to meet its goal within the
one-year time frame.
</P>

 &HT;    Hello 2000: Jennings to anchor 22 hours
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If a millennium happens and TV doesn't cover
it, is it still a millennium?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not if you're at ABC, which plans 22 continuous hours
of millennial coverage around the globe. Peter Jennings will anchor
all 22 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it as a personal challenge,'' Jennings said of the
marathon assignment, noting the longest he can remember being
on-air for a stretch was 11 1/2 hours, during coverage of the
Challenger disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC coverage begins at 6 a.m. Eastern time, Dec. 31, with
Barbara Walters on a ship cruising the waters of the international
date line, where the millennium will be be rung in first. It ends
(barring an end of the world before that, which presumably ABC
would be positioned to cover extensively) 22 hours later, at 4
a.m., Jan. 1, on the U.S. West Coast (ABC won't finish out the 24
hours by ringing in the New Year in Hawaii, which is two hours
earlier).
</P>
<P>
   In between, ABC will be on hand as the new century is rung in in
each succeeding time zone. The network is part of a 60-country
consortium that will allow it to bring events from every continent.
</P>
<P>
   Among locations to be visited: New Zealand, where David Bowie
performs at midnight; Egypt, where the pyramids will be draped in
gold; an oil rig in Norway, where a concert is being held for the
workers there; and the South African island where Nelson Mandela
will visit the site of his imprisonment. Assignments to
correspondents are still being worked out, though Cokie Roberts,
for instance, could wind up in Rome, where her mother is ambassador
to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   And Dick Clark _ who seemingly hasn't aged in a millennium _
will be his usual rockin' master of ceremonies for the ball drop in
New York's Times Square. He'll also narrate New Year's in the other
U.S. time zones, including at a $70-million-enhanced fountain at
the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to ABC 34 years ago, and Dick was already there for
some time, so he's got to be an integral part,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC coverage will combine entertainment, news and live and
taped reports, with time allotted for local affiliates to air their
own coverage. ABC will cover national celebrations and the common
happenings of the day. It'll look back and ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News President David Westin said he's been assured the
network has ``double and triple backup'' for any Y2K problems. The
network is also prepared to turn to any non-millennial-related news
that might occur that day.
</P>
<P>
   But he added of ABC's daylong coverage, ``We will not look like
a 24-hour cable news channel.''
</P>
<P>
   As for addressing the fact many believe the millennium doesn't
actually begin until 2001, Jennings said that school of thought
will be noted. But he added that the rush toward 2000 is ``a public
train ... and that train is not one I'd like to stand in front
of.''
</P>
<P>
   And the day after?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll all have a technological hangover,'' Jennings
said, ``and football will never look so good.''
</P>
<P>
   De Mornay, Alda on `ER'
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca De Mornay will appear in a five-episode story line of
NBC's ``ER,'' staring with the season opener, but she could remain
with the show after that. Best known for her film roles in 1992's
``The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'' and 1983's ``Risky Business''
opposite Tom Cruise, De Mornay will play a socialite who becomes
romantically involved with Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle). Alan Alda
will also appear on ``ER'' for a five-episode arc, and Maura
Tierney (``NewsRadio'') is expected to join the regular cast.

 &HT;    'Warped Tour' in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Punk Rock Summer Camp, also known as the Vans Warped
Tour '99, is coming to Atlanta as the quietly successful roving
festival makes its fifth jaunt through the summer's concert
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the hot punk and rap acts, skateboarders, Moto-X
riders and other extreme sports pros are an important part of the
tour, lending the scene a less sedentary air than some other
festivals. The hormonal surges and wanton destruction that raged
out of control at Woodstock '99 have more productive outlets on the
Warped Tour. The average Warped-goer is at least nominally more
political and the communal atmosphere created by the bands spills
over to the crowds. It may be among the last bastions of the punk
ethos, a credo that seeks to break down the barriers between the
bands and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   In that egalitarian punk spirit, there is no headliner on the
tour. The set times and performing order are decided on the day of
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Despite corporate sponsorship and bands with a higher profile,
the tour has tried to maintain its underground credentials with a
commitment to local and unsigned talent, a concerted effort at
cultivating female fans and a relatively inexpensive price tag of
$26.25 per ticket. A portion of the tour's proceeds benefits the
AIDS charity Camp Pacific Heartland, raising half the charity's
yearly operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to credibility with kids, though. So, is it
punk rock? As rapper Ice-T puts it on the tour's online radio show:
``On the Warped Tour, you're gonna be able to express yourself to
the fullest, have a good time. It's truly punk rock. The more
corporate the money, the better. Just take 'em and use their
money.''
</P>
<P>
   HOT ACTS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Blink-182 _Making a repeat appearance on the Warped tour, the
new-school punk trio has been toiling away since 1993. The band
just scored a big radio hit with ``What's My Age Again?'' from its
fourth album, ``Enema of the State.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Eminem _ The 1999 tour also boasts the first Atlanta
appearance of the Detoit rap phenomenon . After a couple of
canceled dates, it looks like he might make it this time.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sevendust _ Atlanta's own masters of metal mayhem. The quintet
is fresh from an appearance at the troubled Woodstock '99.
</P>
<P>
   1 p.m. today. $26.25 plus service charge at Ticketmaster, $29.25
at the gate. Lakewood Amphitheatre, 2002 Lakewood Way S.W.
404-249-6400.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Main Stage lineup (times, order determined day of show):
Pennywise, Blink-182, Sevendust, Eminem, Black Eyed Peas, Less Than
Jake, The Living End. Suicidal Tendencies, Molotov, Ice-T, 7
Seconds, The Vandals, Dropkick Murphys, Royal Crown Revue, Atomic
Fireballs.

DOCTORS, NURSES SAY PATIENTS DENIED SERVICES IN MANAGED CARE,
SURVEY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.) (rk) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new survey shows widespread discontent among
doctors and nurses about the quality of health care under managed
care plans. A majority of doctors said some of their patients had
been denied coverage for a health service they needed, whether a
prescription drug, a diagnostic test or a treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was released in the midst of a struggle over
patients' rights legislation on Capitol Hill, and was immediately
criticized by spokesmen for health maintenance organizations and
the insurance industry as flawed and exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
nonprofit health research group, was just as quickly praised by the
American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Altman, the president of Kaiser, acknowledged that doctors
are not always right when they prescribe a test, a drug or a
treatment, and that therefore not every denial of coverage by a
health plan is a bad thing. But he argued, ``I don't know that
anyone would strongly defend this level of conflict as an efficient
way to run a health system.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignani, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, which represents health maintenance organizations and other
managed care organizations, said the Kaiser study was
``inconsistent with existing research which has provided a very
different assessment of these issues.'' Previous studies have shown
that health plans approve coverage for the vast majority of
services recommended by doctors, she said, adding that the Kaiser
study failed to focus on how often doctors recommend inappropriate
care.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser study was conducted with the Harvard School of Public
Health and was administered by mail to a sample of 1,053 physicians
and 768 nurses, between Feb. 11 and June 5. The findings for the
doctors have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3
percentage points; for nurses, of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent of doctors said insurance plans denied
coverage for a prescription drug for one of their patients on a
weekly or monthly basis. Thirty-one percent said they experienced
denials of a hospital stay on a weekly or monthly basis, and 42
percent said they had experienced denials of diagnostic tests or
procedures that often. (Another 27 percent said they had
experienced denials for diagnostic tests every six months to a
year.)
</P>
<P>
   Between a third and two-thirds of the doctors said their most
recent denial had resulted in a serious decline in the patient's
health status, depending on the type of service denied.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of the nurses surveyed said they saw patients'
health suffer because of decisions made by health plans. Thirty
percent of the nurses _ and 26 percent of the doctors _ said they
sometimes exaggerated the severity of a patient's condition to get
care they thought was necessary. And a majority of doctors said
that they or someone in their office would periodically try to
intervene with a health plan on their patients' behalf, and were
often successful.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and nurses did have some good things to say about
managed care, the HMOs and other health networks that now deliver
care to most Americans. Forty-five percent of the doctors and 42
percent of the nurses said managed care increased the likelihood
that patients will get preventive services.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of primary care physicians felt that way. And 68
percent of the doctors and 51 percent of the nurses said that
managed care had increased the use of guidelines and disease
management protocols, more modern and standardized ways of treating
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, a strikingly negative view emerges of managed
care. Ninety-five percent of the doctors said it had increased the
amount of administrative paperwork for providers and patients.
Seventy-two percent said it had decreased the quality of health
care for people who are sick, and 77 percent said it had decreased
the ability of patients to get the tests and treatments they
needed. Eighty-six percent said it had decreased the ability of
patients to see medical specialists, and 83 percent said it had
decreased the amount of time doctors spend with their patients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, these concerns affect the quality of the care
patients receive,'' said Dr. J. Edward Hill, a trustee of the
American Medical Association, who was on a panel convened by Kaiser
Wednesday to discuss the survey. ``Doctors know it, nurses know it,
and most importantly, patients know it. Not surprisingly, the only
sector of the health care industry that refuses to acknowledge this
fact is the one that has the most to gain from the status quo _ the
insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In another survey released Wednesday, the National Committee on
Quality Assurance, a nonprofit organization focused on measuring
the quality of managed care organizations, evaluated data
voluntarily submitted from 410 health plans that cover 70 million
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 57 percent of people rated their health
plans an 8, 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale, and that there was a
strong connection between accountability, clinical performance and
customer satisfaction. Three-fourths of consumers in the survey
said that getting needed care was not a problem, while 17.9 percent
said it was a small problem and 8.6 percent said it was a big
problem. New England health plans were out in front on a variety of
measures, like smoking cessation efforts and cervical cancer
screening.

 &HT;    Summertime leisure turns thoughts to how to retire early, with
money
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retire early, retire rich. Those are themes in a number of
midsummer issues of business and personal finance magazines, which
offer advice on how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune (Aug. 16) warns that a dream retirement ``will cost more
than you ever imagined, but you can get there. All you need is a
simple plan.''
</P>
<P>
   A retiree can generally expect to maintain a pre-retirement
standard of living on 65 percent to 85 percent of current salary,
the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money (August), calling retirement ``America's newest
obsession,'' attributes the big trend to creation of the 401(k)
plan, which has often replaced traditional company-operated pension
systems. Thanks to the bull market on Wall Street, two-thirds of
all 401(k) contributors told pollsters they expect to retire early,
the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   According to Money (August), trying to guess the stock market's
every twitch and turn is a waste of time. Adopt a sound plan and
stick to it. Some suggestions: Take profits on investments that
have already soared, don't be shy about letting cash build up in
your portfolio, add bonds to balance your total holdings and look
for undervalued stocks.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth the loner
</P>
<P>
   Business Week (Aug. 2) says BellSouth must make acquisitions to
survive intact in the new, deregulated world of telecommunications.
That's what rivals of the Atlanta-based Baby Bell are already
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysts say that BellSouth has a window of maybe two years to
bulk up before competitors digest their current acquisitions and
come hunting,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Officer F. Duane Ackerman is mum on all the
options but won't rule out anything, Business Week adds.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve may be creating an unintended problem with
its policy of low interest and inflation rates, says Individual
Investor (August). By keeping borrowing costs so low, businesses
are expanding too fast _ investment as a percentage of gross
domestic product is near a 70-year high. The risk is
overproduction, which usually leads to the very inflation the Fed
wants to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (August) rates and ranks
more than 2,000 mutual funds in a special midyear funds edition
that tries to make sense of a stock market that is ``behaving in
new and strange ways.''
</P>
<P>
   All you need to start a successful new business is $1,000,
according to Inc. (August), which offers the advice you'll need to
make it happen. Among its suggestions: look for freebies
everywhere, and draft your family and friends for help.

MAVERICKS SAY THEIR FIRST-ROUND PICK IS HEADED TO EUROPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Dallas Mavericks are headed back to Plan A, which
means first-round draft pick Leon Smith is headed to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Coach and general manager Don Nelson said Wednesday the team has
informed Smith and his agent that the 18-year-old rookie is not
ready for the NBA. In fact, with Smith expected to miss the
Mavericks' remaining summer league games while in Chicago trying to
terminate his status as a ward of Illinois, the next time he wears
a Mavericks uniform will likely be next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not disappointed in him because this is exactly what we
expected,'' Nelson said. ``He's loaded with talent, but he doesn't
know what to do with it. He needs a lot of work on the
fundamentals, and the best way to get that is by lots of playing
time. We think the best place for him now is Europe for a year.
That was Plan A all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 6-foot-11 center trying to make the jump from high
school to the NBA, made a shaky debut in Dallas, storming off the
court and refusing to run sprints after his first practice. His
play was considerably more promising, averaging 7.5 points and 5.4
rebounds while playing 14 minutes per game in seven summer
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   He had by far his best game on Saturday against the Ukrainian
National Team in Long Beach, Calif., scoring 16 points and grabbing
16 rebounds. He also, however, fouled out in only 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the first time we just turned him loose and let
him play,'' Nelson said. ``He had a double-double, but he didn't
know what he was doing. He wanted a chance to prove he was ready
and we gave it to him. But there's no doubt, he's not ready. Not
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who indicated Smith agreed with the decision to delay
his NBA debut, said ideally he'd like to have Smith's season
overseas monitored by Tony Runzone, the team's director of
international scouting. Briefly Despite free-agent forward Gary
Trent deciding not to re-sign with the Mavericks immediately,
Nelson remains confident of retaining his No. 1 off-season
priority. ``His agent owes it to him to see if a big offer comes
out of nowhere,'' Nelson said. ``But we're still in the same, good
position.'' Trent, high on the wish lists of Seattle and the
Clippers, can begin formal negotiations with teams and sign a
contract Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent forward Samaki Walker, considered a priority only if
Trent leaves, is receiving interest from a number of teams, headed
by the Celtics. Walker, who would be Trent's backup in Dallas, has
an offer on the table to stay a Maverick. ``We either want to sign
him or sign and trade him,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks finish their summer league play Monday against the
Jazz in Salt Lake City. Nelson said his best three players have
been guards Greg Buckner and Anthony Carter, and second-year
forward Dirk Nowitzki. ``His confidence level is just so much
higher,'' Nelson said of Nowitzki. ``Plus, we think he's grown
maybe another half-inch up to over 7 feet.'' nn

LEADERS TO DISCUSS FUTURE OF BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO _ It is billed as a group talk on peace and stability,
but Friday's meeting here with President Clinton and European
leaders on the future of the Balkans looks more like a
dysfunctional family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   At the birthplace of World War I _ still scarred from the more
recent 1992-95 Bosnian War _ participants at the two-day summit
will seek ways to heal the area's ailing economies and rebuild
war-ravaged lands.
</P>
<P>
   But will they stop feuding long enough to talk?
</P>
<P>
   The host nation, Bosnia and Herzegovina, suffers from tension
among Muslims, Croats and Serbs so severe that many analysts
believe war would break out if NATO pulled out its patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Bosnia, signals are emerging that Balkans will keep
splintering, even after warfare's end in Kosovo. Slobodan
Milosevic, the starring actor in a decade of Balkan bloodshed, has
been pointedly excluded from the talks, but the nation he rules
will dominate discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Making noises about separating from Belgrade is Yugoslavia's
junior republic, Montenegro, whose Western-friendly President Milo
Djukanovic will attend the summit. He is considering escaping
Belgrade's economic deterioration by developing Montenegro's own
currency.
</P>
<P>
   But Yugoslav President Milosevic is also not likely to loosen
ties without a fight _ any more than he did with former Yugoslav
republics Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia. A war in Montenegro could
be especially bloody, analysts and Montenegrin officials warn,
since the republic is home to both Serb loyalists and Montenegrin
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, so badly bloodied in the war with the Serbs, may also
move towards independence, despite worries that the majority ethnic
Albanians _ who have little experience with democratic self-rule _
are not yet prepared to run their own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect parts of Yugoslavia will become independent
countries, and much faster than people think,'' said Paul Goble, an
expert on Eastern and Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While the West has been reluctant to back independence movements
in the region, it would be better off accepting that it simply
can't force people to stay together when they don't want to, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to hold countries together for the sake of holding
countries together will just get you violence or repression or
both,'' Goble said.
</P>
<P>
   International governments and aid organizations are hoping to
force some stability on the region by propping up their flailing
economies, and helping those still suffering from the wars.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels Wednesday, more than 100 countries and organizations
pledged $2.1 billion in aid for Kosovo, where hundreds of thousands
of refugees have returned to destroyed or severely damaged homes.
The United States offered the lion's share of aid, $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 120,000 homes _ more than half the houses in Kosovo
_ are damaged and 40,000 are completely ruined, according to a
study commissioned by the European Union. Home rebuilding alone
will cost $1 billion, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   For Kosovo, Balkan watchers say the West should learn from the
mistakes it made in Bosnia. While Bosnia has suffered little
violence since the war ended, its economy is still poor, despite
the billions of dollars the international community has put here,
said James Lyon, a political analyst with the Sarajevo-based
International Crisis Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are seriously discussing throwing huge quantities of
money at a part of the world that is completely unstable, and has
the possibility of exploding in a few years, or even a few
months,'' Lyon said. ``There has to be security'' first.
</P>
<P>
   Western nations are also using cash to punish, as well to help.
Most are concluding that upper Serbia should not be assisted in
repairing the damage done by 78 days of NATO strikes as long as
Milosevic is still in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a consensus that we should do what we can to
help the Serbia people. But there is no intention to provide
assistance for the Milosevic regime,'' Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said after meeting in Rome with Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a place in the stability pact for a democratic
Serbia,'' added Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also voted Wednesday to
tighten sanctions on Serbia, and to provide $100 million to aid the
Serbian opposition. Serbian opposition figures were asked to attend
the Sarajevo meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The region's difficulties meanwhile extend well beyond
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia is feeling the heat from the International War Crimes
Tribunal, which Wednesday recommended life imprisonment for one
accused Croatian war criminal. The prosecution of Croatian military
leaders has led to speculation that Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman may himself be indicted, as Milosevic was in May.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal's chief investigator, Louise Arbour, also made a
formal complaint about Croatia Wednesday, charging that the nation
had been ``delinquent'' in cooperating with her probe into a 1995
Croatian attack on Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Albania's economy is a basket case, and the nation _ Europe's
poorest _ is marred by murders stemming from ethnic blood feuds and
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary and Romania are in a snit because Romania doesn't want
to allow the creation of a Hungarian-language university for the
ethnic minority there.
</P>
<P>
   And the Serbs are annoyed with Hungary's government for pushing
for autonomy for the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina, where
there is a 15-17 percent ethnic Hungarian population.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the simmering ethnic tension _ not to mention the
economic troubles and infrastructural damage _ Balkan stability may
take a long time, observers say. The unpredictability of the events
in the region, experts say, make calming the Balkans even more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not mathematics, It's algebra,'' Goble said. ``There are
just so many uncertainties.''

`GOOD MORNING AMERICA'S' TEMPORARY CREW LOOKS NOT SO TEMPORARY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Charles Gibson said his brain was fried after
he'd risen early in New York, done ``Good Morning America'' and
then flown to Los Angeles with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   So go ahead, Gibson said, make up quotations for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supposed to say something about how much the program has
improved, which I do feel,'' he said. ``But whatever quote you'd
like to write down from my mouth about how much the program has
improved, I will endorse it and accept that totally.''
</P>
<P>
   All right:
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has made an infinitesimal improvement since I came
back to it,'' Gibson said. ``But frankly, I felt more comfortable
sitting at home in curlers and my fluffy pink housecoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to avail myself of this opportunity, in front of the
national television press, to say that every moment of working with
Diane Sawyer is as painful to me as a hot poker.
</P>
<P>
   ``And finally, I'd like to announce today that my next career
move will be to host a reality series on the UPN network. It will
be a revised version of the popular UPN series `RedHanded,' but due
to major content changes, it will now be called `WetHanded.'''
</P>
<P>
   So there you go. Or at least that's how I heard it, and I have
Charlie's unqualified endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of him. Just to his left, Sawyer was looking tired
and milky, and trying not to explain her work absences.
</P>
<P>
   Those would be Monday and Tuesday last week, when ``Good Morning
America'' and the rest of the news world were up to their nostrils
in covering the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his
sister-in-law. For those two days, Sawyer was absent with leave,
though neither she nor her indulgent bosses have been willing to
explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the guesswork has centered on Sawyer's status as a
wealthy New York socialite-celebrity with personal attachments to
Kennedy relatives. Consequently, she was supposedly sharing the
Kennedy grief while her colleagues sucked it in and went to work.
</P>
<P>
   It's an explanation that might evoke mixed feelings about
Sawyer. As in loyal friend but fickle news star. Never mind, said
Sawyer. The ``grief-stricken'' account isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stories, I have no idea where they came from,''
she said. ``That was not the situation. ... I do want to make it
clear that I think a lot of people in this country felt the weight
of the tragedy. I'm not saying that I didn't too, but that was not
the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated prods, Sawyer wouldn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just say that it was a personal decision ... some
personal obligations that I should make sure that I served,'' she
said. ``I'm so lucky that my co-anchor and my executive producer
and (ABC News president) David Westin agreed with me that that was
the right decision ... Everybody understood and seemed to agree
with me that I had, as I say, these obligations that I should tend
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer provided the same nonexplanation, in almost the same
words, three or four times.
</P>
<P>
   She has as much right as anyone to ``personal obligations,'' to
arrange work absences with her bosses and to duck questions.
</P>
<P>
   But bear in mind, as another critic was whispering in my ear
during the Sawyer-Gibson press session, that these people have no
compunction about poking a camera in the face of a teenager who's
just seen his best friends shot to pieces. Yet no one at ABC wants
to answer questions about why Sawyer missed two days of work. Hint
of a double standard, no?
</P>
<P>
   On to public business. The broadcast cranny of morning
television is in complete flux, with CBS readying Bryant Gumbel and
a glitzy new studio for ``The Early Show,'' while ABC is building
an open-face Times Square studio for ``GMA,'' and NBC's ``Today''
rules the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``GMA'' was circling the drain with Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman
until Sawyer and Gibson replaced them early this year. The ratings
stabilized and then began climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, Sawyer and Gibson have been designated from the
get-go as temporary co-anchors. Gibson said he and Sawyer are
``transitional figures,'' committed to ``GMA'' through next May.
But, he said, news president Westin has ``extraordinary persuasive
powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson added, ``My wife keeps asking me how much longer we're
going to do this, and I don't have an answer for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Should be easy. Until the UPN premiere of ``WetHanded.''

COURT REPORTERS SEE DANGER IN MEGA-DEALS WITH AGENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Hundreds of court reporters are in Boston for the
centennial anniversary of their role as silent observers who,
methodically and unobtrusively, capture every word uttered in
courtroom proceedings and pretrial depositions.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the celebration of the event _ which includes an annual
contest to determine the nation's fastest court reporter _ is
increasing concern over what many court reporters view as a
dangerous trend in their profession and a growing threat to the
integrity of the legal system: large reporting agencies that cut
deals with major corporations, including law firms and insurance
companies, for preferential services and pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as another way that insurers and corporate
defendants are trying to rig the justice system in their favor,''
said Pamela Pressley, an attorney for the Foundation for Taxpayer
and Consumer Rights, a national nonprofit consumer advocacy
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The practice puts lawyers representing clients who sue these
companies at a disadvantage, opponents say. But proponents of the
special arrangements disagree, saying they are mere cost-saving
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The deals often include discounted rates and special services,
such as free advance drafts of deposition transcripts, databases of
transcripts from all cases in which a client company has a stake,
and witness information sheets that compile otherwise confidential
data, such as Social Security numbers, for quick reference in later
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are services that court reporters shouldn't be involved
in,'' Pressley said. ``Court reporters are the one party in
depositions who are supposed to be completely impartial and have no
ties, financial or otherwise, to either side.''
</P>
<P>
   In a typical scenario, a court reporting firm signs a long-term
contract with an insurance company or other corporate litigant,
promising to provide exclusive reporting services for all the
company's legal proceedings. The reporting firm then acts as a
temporary agency, contracting freelance court reporters to supply
those services.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the practice say it jeopardizes the impartiality of
the judicial system by allowing one side in a legal proceeding to
receive special services from an ostensibly neutral court reporter.
Detractors also charge that the practice puts litigants who are
unable or unwilling to afford such services at a legal
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the practice, including many large corporate
defendants, say such contracts are simply cost-saving devices that
hold down litigation expenses. Contracting, they say, is the way of
the future in the legal profession, just as mergers and
acquisitions have become necessary survival tactics for countless
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients need services they would like us to provide, and
they're entitled to a discount as a result,'' said Michael Sandler,
president and chief executive officer of New Jersey-based Amerinet
Litigation Services, a court reporting agency with offices across
the country. ``That's the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   He likens his company to a Wal-Mart or Barnes and Noble, massive
corporate entities that buy merchandise in bulk, enabling them to
sell products at a discount. ``You need to have a national presence
in order to compete to get this work,'' Sandler said, ``and the
local guys don't have the ability to get that work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' he added, ``they fabricated all the arguments
on the other side because they're at a competitive disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandler insists that clients of reporting agencies receive no
unfair preferential treatment, and that such agencies ``don't go
beyond any ethical barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We give our clients no preferential services and our reporters
are under no pressure to treat our clients other than they do other
clients,'' he said. ``These issues are not real.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the matter only affects civil cases, and only involves
court reporters who transcribe pretrial witness depositions, not
official courtroom proceedings. But, added Pressley, ``official
court reporters are also concerned about the problem because they
see themselves as being next.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 14 states have enacted laws or adopted regulations that
outlaw or strictly curtail contractual arrangements between
litigants and court reporters. In Massachusetts, Representative
Harold P. Naughton (D-Clinton), has proposed legislation that would
prevent the practice, and several other states have similar
restrictions pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing in the judicial process that is never questioned is
the record, and that's what makes contracting all the more
dangerous here,'' said Laura Hebb, president of Massachusetts Court
Reporters Association. ``We feel it's nothing more than
extortion.''

 &HT;    Message to market: Higher interest rates
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan delivered his
third inflation warning in two months on Wednesday. It didn't
produce the immediate seismic waves of earlier speeches, but it
left analysts braced for at least one more interest rate hike this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the second stage of his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony, Greenspan fueled fears of higher rates by telling the
Senate Banking Committee that the Fed is ready to move ``promptly
and forcefully'' against any sign of renewed inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same message he delivered to the House Banking
Committee last week and to the Joint Economic Committee in June.
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders, however, apparently paid as much attention to a
Financial Accounting Standards Board decision on research and
development costs as to Greenspan's testimony, boosting technology
stocks and giving the Nasdaq composite index its second straight
gain _ 0.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average posted the only loss _ 0.06
percent _ among major stock indexes, and nervous bond traders
failed to sustain enough buying to hold the 30-year Treasury yield
below 6 percent, where it traded briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the second-quarter earnings season is ending, analysts
say investors' attention will turn increasingly to inflation and
interest rates as engines of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the economy is still strong and inflation is zero,
I don't see a lot of problems coming for the market,'' said Fred C.
Allvine, director of Georgia Tech's Stock Market Project. ``But if
we were to see inflation numbers coming in higher, the market could
get a chill.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Greenspan again defended the strategy of
``pre-emptive'' strikes in the form of higher interest rates at the
earliest signs of inflation. He warned especially of wage
inflation, because tight labor markets threaten to push wages
higher despite productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee raised the
short-term federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to
5 percent on June 29, the first rate hike since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed indicated at the time that it had adopted a
``neutral'' stance toward additional increases, some analysts
believe another increase is in the offing, maybe as early as the
Fed's next meeting Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is the Fed is still leaning toward raising rates and
probably will do so at their August meeting,'' said First Union
economist Jay H. Bryson. He said inflation will be a threat as long
as the economy grows more than 3 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts think Greenspan is trying to use persuasion to
get consumers and businesses to spend less, and investors to slow
the pace of the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our take on this is that he didn't say anything new, that he
is jawboning,'' said Scott E. Marcouiller of A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.

GORE TOUTS BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN HOUSTON SPEECH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By R.A. DYER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a speech laced liberally with Spanish, Vice
President Al Gore told about 1,000 Hispanic leaders Wednesday that
he supports bilingual education, opposes school vouchers and backs
universal pre-school education.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the annual conference of the National Council
of La Raza, the Democrats' leading presidential contender also
called for government action to save Social Security and Medicare _
and said Republican tax cut plans could doom both programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not directly mention Democratic presidential rival Bill
Bradley or Texas Gov. George W. Bush _ the GOP front-runner _
although the vice president did belittle one of Bush's favorite
campaign themes: compassionate conservatism. Likewise, Gore said a
voucher system to help students attend private schools _ also
supported by Bush _ would hurt public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need now is not an abandonment of public education by
draining money away from public schools with ill-considered,
ill-devised voucher schemes,'' Gore said. ``We should make a
national commitment and go all-out to give access to high-quality
pre-school to every child, in every family, all over the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore opened his discourse in Spanish, telling the crowd: ``I'm
here with you, because as you all know, I love and respect the
Latino community.'' It was the first of numerous Spanish-language
comments by Gore, including a reference to himself as an
``abuelito'' or ``little grandfather'' _ which drew laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd generally responded favorably to his comments in
Spanish, although applause seemed greatest when Gore took up
educational themes. The vice president said the drop-out rate among
Hispanic teens is unacceptably high, called for smaller classes,
and said every classroom should have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need revolutionary improvements in our schools, and we need
them now,'' said Gore. ``We have to build new schools, modernize
schools and treat our teachers like professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   He tied improvements in schools and the strengthening of the
Medicare system and Social Security to responsible tax cuts. He
said Republican tax cut plans, which President Clinton has promised
to veto, would hurt those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must keep the prosperity going _ but I want to do it the
right way _ not by letting people fend for themselves, and hoping
for crumbs of compassion,'' said Gore. We must ``resist the
temptation to blow the entire surplus on some risky tax-cut scheme
that puts back in the deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also called for a more accurate census count, contending
that the last 1990 Census undercounted Hispanics by more than 5
percent. Democrats have waged a partisan battle with Republicans
over the issue, with Democrats saying the use of some statistical
sampling would provide a more accurate population count _
especially of minority populations.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore believes he has a potent
weapon in the presidential race _ his knowledge of public policy
issues. He has staked out positions on scores of topics and
suggests that his opponents, both Democratic and Republican, have
been vague and therefore undeserving.
</P>
<P>
   On everything from education to crime to cancer research, Gore
has weighed in: preschool for all children, a ban on gang-style
clothing, photo licenses for anyone who buys a handgun and a
doubling of financing for cancer research over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to ``keep the prosperity going'' and to create more
time for families to spend together. He wants to end trade barriers
and outlaw any tax on sales made over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He warns about the ``digital divide,'' in which blacks and
Hispanics have less access to computers than whites, a disparity
that he says undermines job training and threatens America's
ability to remain the world's economic superpower. Chiefly, he
says, he wants to give the country a moral transfusion, making it
``not only better off, but better.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore is planning to offer more specifics, this time
on tax cuts. He is to propose his own version of tax cuts for the
middle class, aides say. Wednesday, he bashed Republicans for
proposing to spend most of the budget surplus on a ``risky'' tax
cut without first shoring up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The blizzard of positions is the essence of the
Gore-for-president campaign, designed to show voters that the vice
president has ideas and experience and, by contrast, to suggest
that his opponents do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm campaigning this way because I believe that campaigns
ought to be based on ideas, and I think voters have a right to know
exactly what a candidate for president is proposing to do as
president,'' Gore said in an interview. ``Our democracy is
ill-served by an over-reliance on generalities and fuzzy rhetoric
and is much better served by specific, detailed discussions of the
tough choices we have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers say they have been disappointed about media
attention on his political problems despite his focus on issues,
although a recent poll by the Dallas Morning News suggests that
voters at this point seem to put little stock in issues.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that even though most Americans admit they know
little about Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front
runner, they strongly favor him over Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But since mid-May, Gore has delivered four speeches that his
aides call major policy addresses, covering education, crime,
faith-based organizations and cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gore's positions follow routes laid out by President
Clinton, such as insisting on a balanced budget. Some bump up
against Democratic orthodoxy, such as his advocacy of teacher
testing. But perhaps the most striking thing about his positions is
the sheer volume of them, especially so early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore becomes almost indignant when asked if his avalanche of
positions might be overwhelming voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say, `You're giving too many details, you're
offering too many specifics,' my response is, `Too many compared to
what?''' he said. ``Compared to nothing? And how did we get in a
situation where it's considered odd to offer a detailed set of
policy proposals for the challenges we face?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who last year floated and then abandoned the slogan of
``practical idealism,'' has yet to adopt another that melds his
various proposals into an overarching theme.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he stands for, he offered the following: ``Keep the
prosperity going, make certain no one's left behind, bring
revolutionary improvement to our public schools, build stronger
families and more liveable communities.''
</P>
<P>
   He generally stays away from emotional and ideological causes,
although he supports abortion rights and the death penalty and has
endorsed affirmative action programs. In a visit to Washington
state this month, he denounced a ballot initiative, passed by the
state's voters in 1998, that struck down affirmative action
programs in hiring by public agencies and admissions to state
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   By de-emphasizing such matters, and by supporting Republican
ideas like federal money for churches to help fight social ills,
Gore is placing himself squarely in the school of ``New Democrats''
that Clinton pioneered so effectively.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has already carved out that territory, leaving his
vice president to cast about for self-definition that does not seem
derivative. Even Gore's pending proposal for a middle-class tax cut
has a Clinton provenance. As a candidate in 1992, Clinton promised
a middle-class tax cut, which he soon abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a Democratic consultant who is not involved with the
Gore campaign, said Gore had yet to break through to voters with a
clear sense of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for Al Gore is that Clinton put his imprint
every place on the issues, so for Al Gore to be able to find `his'
issues is a lot more difficult,'' Hart said. ``In the end, all of
these issues have to tell us something about Gore and what the
election is about. The problem is, the campaign needs a theme.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore began his strategic roll-out of issue speeches with
education to signal his belief that a strong education system is
the underpinning of a strong economy. ``In order to stay first in
the world economically, we must become first in the world
educationally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called for a substantial but unspecified federal investment
in public education. Apart from universal preschool and teacher
testing, he proposed a teacher corps, where young people teach in
needy schools in exchange for $10,000 for college. He proposed
``second-chance'' schools, in which students who ``are headed for
trouble'' are put into more disciplined environments.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would urge teachers and parents to meet at the
beginning of the school year and sign a strict discipline code, and
he would require that employers allow workers to take time off for
such meetings. He would extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to
allow time off for all parent-teacher conferences. And he would
require schools to teach ``character education'' courses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to reduce the size of classes to 18 students in early
grades and to no more than 20 for all grades. Opposing the use of
school vouchers, he said, ``We must reject the false promise of
siphoning public school funding away to private schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would use the technological revolution to replace
standardized textbook learning with individualized learning at each
child's own pace. He wants every child to be computer-literate by
the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Gore tax, a surcharge on every American's
telephone bill, has already collected $2 billion to hook up every
school in the country to the Internet. He would create a nationwide
volunteer army of ``e-tutors,'' or online instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposed a national tuition-savings program, and he
said he wants to create new tax-free 401-J accounts that let
workers save for job training and other educational experiences.

CLERKS PAY FOR MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LINDA TRISCHITTA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ If you're worried when placing a bet on
the horses, just think of the clerk who takes the money at the
betting window.
</P>
<P>
   If the clerk makes a mistake, he or she must pay for it. The
largest error last year cost one unlucky bet taker $1,500, close to
the $2,000 clerks may earn in a season.
</P>
<P>
   The pari-mutuel clerks just learned that at a recently completed
four-hour class conducted by the New York Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're nervous,'' said Vince Hogan, director of
mutuels for NYRA, who will have 400 of his 575 clerks taking up to
450 bets each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day I'm gonna lose 50 of them,'' he said of the
anticipated resignations. ``I can bet on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic Saratoga track opens today for its 131st season, a
36-day meet that runs through Labor Day and features 35 stakes
races with purses totaling more than $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   NYRA hopes to match last year's opening day crowd of 25,570.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks may process more than $3 million in bets, as they did for
the 1998 opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be happy if we reach $2.5 million,'' Hogan said. ``Last
year we had an exceptional year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the sixth and final training session Monday afternoon, 40
candidates studied their 81-key terminals that compute bets but do
not calculate change.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding a microphone and with a Long Island accent, Jack Dunn,
a clerk and trainer, called out practice bets for the trainees to
process into the machines that spewed white dummy tickets toward
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that 20 percent of bets are straight: win, place,
show or across the board. The rest are the ``exotics,'' forward and
reverse wheels, trifectas, quinellas (which Dunn said is ``an
exacta that auto reverses itself'') and boxing of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little robot in the basement that sorts it all
out,'' Dunn said. Clerks also process wagers for simulcast events
and races from the Meadowlands or the West Coast. ``If you're gonna
screw up, let it be today,'' he counseled.
</P>
<P>
   Screwing up was on the mind of substitute elementary school
teacher Nancy Cross, 47, of Malta, N.Y., who took the class twice
to become more comfortable with racing lingo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt overwhelmed, but I'm starting to get it better,'' Cross
said. ``I'm doing this because I have four teenagers, one in
college. The money is needed ... And it's better than day care
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Homemaker Patricia Downey, 44, from Speigletown, N.Y., felt more
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really hard,'' she said. ``I've got a 13-year-old who
wants all these high-priced things for school, so this will help
out.'' Pari-mutuel clerks are fired for gambling. They must compute
transactions in their heads, protect themselves from quick-change
scams and endure stress from superstitious bettors.They also have
to work without a lunch hour and have only seven-minute breaks
between races. Clubhouse regulars have been known to travel with
bodyguards carrying suitcases filled with cash, veteran clerks
said. But big players are not always big tippers.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Guthrie, 39, of Saratoga Springs will begin her 12th
racing season today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get customers who come to my window every year,'' said
Guthrie, who described one couple that tips her $200 when their
two-week vacation in the city ends. ``I had another bettor five or
six years ago who won $52,000 on a Pick 6. My window was closed 45
minutes, we had to get a Pinkerton escort for him, and he tipped me
nothing. So that's the range.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's parting advice to the new recruits included how to endure
distractions like ``a few buttons open here and there'' or
celebrities like Tom Cruise and Sandra Bullock, both of whom have
made bets at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   For Guthrie, it's all part of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep coming back because it's exciting,'' she said. ``It's
the human condition, different from any other job.''

QUIT BEING SO CONTRARY, BARRY, AND JUST COME BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guess the Detroit Lions got what they had coming to them, huh,
Barry Sanders? They couldn't win, so you just up and quit playing
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   And I thought Ken Griffey Jr. had it all wrong with his ranting
and raving that no amount of money could keep him with the
perennial losing Seattle Mariners. But at least Griffey didn't just
take his ball and go home. Yet you, Barry, are in London, laughing
as the rest of us, like mourners at a funeral, wonder ``Why?'' and
``Is he really done?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure glad other signature athletes in sports history didn't take
the low road out like you did, Barry. What if Ernie Banks had
retired early because he was tired of losing with the Chicago Cubs,
or if O.J. Simpson quit because he was tired of losing with the
Buffalo Bills?
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture?
</P>
<P>
   But it goes deeper than that. What kind of example could you be
setting for kids who look up to you as a hero? (''Uh, hey junior,
if the little league softball team loses again next week, it's OK
for you to quit on your teammates and take up harp lessons.'')
</P>
<P>
   Barry, I hope you really know what you are doing. It would be a
shame if you look back one day and say, ``Man, I wish I would've
played another year or two. I was just 1,458 yards away from
breaking Walter Payton's NFL career rushing record.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, everyone has the right to go when they think it's
time to go. And who are we to question what's in your heart, Barry?
In that statement you issued Wednesday morning, you told us that
you no longer had a desire to play the game. You said you had no
problems with the Lions or Lions management.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, then why last spring did you let your father
tell the Detroit newspapers that you were sick of the Lions and
sick of losing? Why not pick up a phone and call the Lions to
inform them of your decision? And why wait until the beginning of
training camp to announce a decision you had obviously made after
the end of the 1998 season?
</P>
<P>
   In your mind, Barry, maybe the Lions deserve their fate. But
what about your fans? Like Michael Jordan and John Elway, you,
Barry, will go down as one of the greatest athletic performers in
sports history. But you couldn't even get, ``Goodbye,'' right. When
somebody finally caught up to you Wednesday, you were in London
with trips to Paris and Amsterdam lined up. ``I don't know the
right way to retire,'' you deadpanned as your agents stayed in the
country to release your retirement statement. ``This,'' you said,
``is just my way of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess part of the reason for such a passionately venomous tone
is out of jealousy. OK. There you have it, Barry. But man, we're
going to miss you. We'll miss the way you zigged when the
linebacker thought you were going to zag, the way you could make a
2-yard gain look like the most beautiful run ever.
</P>
<P>
   I was in Detroit that December day in 1997 when you became the
third player in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season.
There was an eerie feeling in the Lions' locker room afterward, for
you had reached the magic milestone on the same day that your
teammate, linebacker Reggie Brown, was temporarily paralyzed and
nearly died from a head-on collision during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of us, much of your attention was on Brown's health.
Soon, though, we came to you for your thoughts on the game you
played and how you helped the Lions earn a playoff berth. I
remember looking at you, with your 5-foot-7 frame, and wondering,
``Is this the same little guy that did all of that out there?''
</P>
<P>
   In your answers to questions that day, you were so humble, so
unassuming. And that's what made the way you retired so puzzling.
Against the way you've always done things, you showed up the Lions,
the coaching staff and the Detroit fans.
</P>
<P>
   So what now? If you don't reverse field and come back to the
NFL, what are we left with? Terrell Davis? Jamal Anderson? Emmitt
Smith? Ricky Williams? Great backs, all, but none with quite the
ability you have to turn a 5-yard loss into an 80-yard gain, and
none at the doorstep of history.
</P>
<P>
   Call me selfish. But I'm not the only one who feels like we've
been unnecessarily cheated.
</P>
<P>
   Come back, Barry. nn

ALEXANDER S. FARKAS, 69; RAN FAMILY DEPARTMENT STORES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)  (yn) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander S. Farkas, who helped build Alexander's department
stores into the place where New Yorkers went to get stylish
fashions for a bargain and then watched as the chain went bankrupt,
died Wednesday in his home in Highland Park, Fla. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his brother, Robin Farkas, said.
</P>
<P>
   The chain was founded in 1928 by Farkas' father, George, who
named both his business and his son after his father. His strategy
was to offer fashions and housewares that were then the exclusive
province of full-service department stores at cut-rate prices by
getting rid of frills like fancy decor and free alterations. ``Dad
went right in between'' the high-end stores and cut-rate clothiers,
``not with decor and ambiance but with style, fashion and price,''
Robin Farkas said at the time of his father's death in 1980. ``It
had not been done that way before.''
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday in the 1930s, the Alexander's flagship store at
Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx served a grateful
cash-strapped immigrant population and boasted more sales per
square foot than any other retailer in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Farkas, who was known as Sandy, was born in New York
City. He was educated at Choate School and the Bronx High School of
Science, attended the University of Chicago and studied business at
Cornell University. Right after school, he got a job loading
freight and then went to work in advertising, but his strong-willed
father soon lured him into the family business, though it was not
necessarily his first love.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1985 interview in The New York Times, Bruce Farkas, another
brother, said, ``We were all coerced into the business. George not
only planned for it but expected our compliance.'' He remembered in
that interview that Alexander wanted to be a ``college history
professor.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Farkas was married five times. Besides his three
brothers, he is survived by his fifth wife, Linda Saltzman Farkas.
He is also survived by three children from his third marriage to
Francine Moss Glansrach: a son, Alexander Farkas of California, and
two daughters, Georgette Farkas and Cindy Glansrach, both of New
York City.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alexander Farkas started as head of stock in the women's coat
department in 1951. His main responsibility, he later joked, was to
carry merchandise from rack to rack. While his father insisted on a
rigorous training program that included stints in all the
departments except the cafeteria, Farkas rose quickly and was named
president and general merchandising manager eight years later. His
father remained chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Farkas began remodeling the image of the
store to be more fashionable. While he continued his father's
policies of ``no credit, no charge accounts, no deliveries and no
alterations,'' he opened new stores _ including the new flagship at
58th Street and Lexington _ and decorated them with touches like
crystal chandeliers. During his first year on the job, he doubled
the chain's advertising budget and developed exclusive arrangements
with European houses to get their excess inventories.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of bumps. After one warm winter season
resulted in disappointing sales and Farkas' father questioned the
new approach, Farkas quit and joined a men's clothing manufacturer.
A week later, his father wooed him back, but with a caveat: a
contract that promised Farkas control over the merchandise. ``I'm
probably the only son working in a family business who has a
written contract,'' Alexander Farkas once noted, ``but it has made
for harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decades, Alexander Farkas helped build Alexander's
into a 16-store business with more than $500 million in annual
revenue. In 1968, the family took the company public. Soon
afterward the semi-retired George Farkas and his wife, Ruth, sold
their shares, and Farkas' brother Jonathan did the same. But
Alexander Farkas and his other two brothers, Bruce and Robin, held
onto shares worth significant stakes in the company, which opened
the way for a family schism years later.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, retailing was getting more competitive in New
York. Whereas Alexander's was one of the few alternatives to the
pricer department stores like Bloomingdale's and Macy's,
competitors like Kmart, Conway and outlet centers began chipping
into the store's clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the real estate Alexander's stores occupied was
appreciating at dizzying speed. The company stock soon attracted
investors like Interstate Properties Inc., a real-estate developer
in New Jersey, and Robert Bass, the financier from Texas, who were
mostly interested in developing such sites beyond retail, which was
not Alexander Farkas' main interest.
</P>
<P>
   After a bad acquisition led to some losses in 1980, Bruce and
Robin joined with Interstate to petition the Securities and
Exchange Commission to gain more influence over the company. Farkas
soon acceded to the dissidents' demands, agreeing to allow the
group to name five new members to the board; both Robin and Bruce
Farkas moved up in the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Alexander Farkas resigned as chief executive. He said
it was just time ``to take life a little easier,'' but pressure
from Interstate, which owned 13 percent of the company by then,
clearly had some effect. He was succeeded by Robin and then by
outside management.
</P>
<P>
   The company went into swift decline and did not make a profit
after 1987 except when it sold stores. In 1992, Alexander's Inc.
declared bankruptcy and closed its last 11 stores. Mayor David N.
Dinkins called the closing ``a sad day for New York City.'' As it
turns out, however, Alexander's was worth more dead than alive. Its
stock, which had been trading at $8.50 in the days before
bankruptcy was declared shot up as high as $57 in the following
year as investors realized the value of its real estate.  &QL;

   RALSTON-APPOINTMENT (Washington) _ President Clinton's decision

SENATE VOTE ON HOLBROOKE LIKELY NEXT WEEK, DEMOCRATIC LEADER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate will probably vote next week on the
long-delayed nomination of Richard Holbrooke to the position of
chief American delegate to the United Nations, the Senate
Democratic leader said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, told
reporters that Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader,
had assured him that the Senate would hold a final vote on the
nomination before lawmakers left for their summer recess next
weekend. Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, indicated some
conditions still needed to be worked out, but Democrats said they
would be easy to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has indicated that it will probably take some debate time
and a vote,'' Daschle said. ``I certainly appreciate the need to do
that, given the opposition on his side, in some cases, to Mr.
Holbrooke. But we'll do that, we'll schedule the time and make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Republican senators, including Lott, have held final
confirmation hostage until the administration addresses a series of
demands that largely have nothing to do with Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky have placed a ``hold''
on Holbrooke's nomination until President Clinton appoints a
conservative Ohio law professor to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa says he will not lift his
objection until an accommodation is made to protect someone he
thinks was a whistle-blower at the U.S. mission to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio is holding things up until he
reviews Holbrooke's role in the administration's Balkan
policy-making.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the holds seemed to be slipping on Wednesday in the wake
of criticism from Republicans like Sens. John Warner of Virginia
and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska that their leaders were hijacking an
important American foreign policy job over extraneous issues.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich appears ready to give up his hold this week,
Republican aides say; Lott and McConnell seem amenable to pursuing
their complaint with the White House, but no longer linking it to
Holbrooke, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday afternoon, Czwartacki had placed three new
conditions on a final vote that seemed intended to provide Senate
Republicans with political cover for their delays.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote will happen, Czwartacki told reporters, if Senate
Democrats cooperate with Republicans to move bills through the
Senate; if Lott finds no new problems in a ``second look'' at
Holbrooke's record; and if Grassley sees progress on his concern.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats are promising to be good, at least until after
the recess; Lott's aides privately say they do not expect him to
find any new questions about Holbrooke's files, and Grassley is
planning to meet with White House officials on Thursday to hash out
their views.

`CANYONING' ADVENTURE TURNS DEADLY FOR 19 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS W. HAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ In heavy rain in the Austrian Alps last spring,
Hendrick Maat stood above a river canyon and watched an
adventurer's nightmare sweep past.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted with wetsuits, helmets, harnesses and ropes, Maat and
a team of ``Canyoners'' eyed the gorge as clear water turned murky
and muddy. The rush of the river grew louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just hear it and you know it's coming. You just have one
minute,'' he said. ``We had a flood wave coming through, and of
course we didn't go in.''
</P>
<P>
   The canyoners exploring a river in the Swiss Alps on Tuesday
were not so lucky. Police are still trying to figure out what went
wrong. But they are certain a group of 45 tourists and eight guides
were caught when a flash flood hit the Saxeten River, a popular
canyoning spot near the Swiss tourist town of Interlacken.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen people were killed and two are missing.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, such a tragedy is not a surprise. Canyoning is
a risky game, with the players rappelling down foaming waterfalls,
sliding over rocks, jumping into deep pools. Thousands of
Americans, Europeans and others are making canyoning one of the
fastest-growing extreme sports, from Australia and the Amazon to
the Alps and the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is that with so many people getting an
adrenaline rush by risking the rivers, the Saxeten accident is the
deadliest for the young sport.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when adventure aficionados drop $65,000 for Everest
expeditions and $50 for Bungee jumps, there is no shortage of
critics when things go wrong. But dedicated canyoners characterize
their sport as one in which mistakes are measured in scrapes,
bruises and broken bones _ not corpses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first accident I've heard of in canyoning where
there are dead people,'' said Maat, a five-year canyoning veteran
who opened his own adventure company in the Austrian Alps this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea of canyoning is to rush down a river the way
water does. Canyoners wear wetsuits and helmets to slide over some
rocks; they hurtle over others. When the rocks are too steep, or
waterfalls too high, canyoners clip on ropes and rappel to a pool
below.
</P>
<P>
   Tour guides say their clients include thrill-seekers and nature
lovers. One guide led 40 Boy Scouts from England, ages 8-14, on a
two-week journey. But older customers sometimes rappel 150-foot
waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customers, they want action, they want adventure, because
most of the customers work in an office,'' said Armin Liedl, who
runs Canyoning Adventure Team in central Austria. ``But they don't
want to spend a lot of time to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Adventure outfitters have flourished in mountain resorts,
particularly in the past three or four years, promoting canyoning
as a step beyond whitewater rafting. Many advertised day trips for
beginners for as little as $50.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure World, the company that led the ill-fated journey
Tuesday, is a leader in the field, billing itself among the biggest
adventure companies in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The company has taken more than 100,000 people rafting, bungee
jumping, mountain biking, rock climbing, paragliding and skydiving.
But canyoning, developed just 15 years ago in France, has become
the company's number one sport. More than 35,000 people have gone
canyoning with Adventure World.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's group was exploring a well-known area around Saxeten,
a river that drains into Lake Brienz, when the flood hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, it's absolutely no problem at all. Hundreds of
thousands have made it already,'' said Urs Zuagg, Interlaken's
director of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Zuagg said that flash floods are extremely uncommon this time of
year. But heavy rains at high elevations can come as a surprise
downstream, where the weather may be fine.
</P>
<P>
   A local jogger first spotted seven bodies clad in life jackets
floating into Lake Brienz. It is not clear wheter the victims
drowned or were killed by rocks, fallen trees, or other debris.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were from Australia, with casualities also
from Britain, South Africa, New Zealand and Switzerland.
Investigators said Wednesday that US and Canadian canyoners in the
group had survived.
</P>
<P>
   The father of one survivor said his 21-year-old daughter barely
made it. ``She said the water was crystal clear one minute and just
murk, mud and logs the next,'' Len Brajkovich told the Australian
Broadcasting Co. ``She went under and somebody grabbed her and she
grabbed somebody else and they just clambered straight up the sides
and back out of reach of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Adventure World has halted its trips until an investigation is
completed. But hundreds more vacationers have arrived in Interlaken
for trips with other operators, Zuagg said.
</P>
<P>
   And in neighboring Austria, more tourists have been signing up
than ever before. Alexandra Fluer, tourism director in the town of
Imst, hasn't been canyoning yet. But she's keeping a date for this
weekend, when she and her staff have plans for a group trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it's dangerous,'' she said, ``but it is
adventure.''

RIDING WHITEWATER, OR CANYONING, POPULAR IN U.S. AND EUROPE FOR
YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Utah, Ariz., Vt.)  (With SWISS-ACCIDENT) 
 (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canyoning has emerged as a trendy ``extreme'' sport, ranking
somewhere between bungee jumping and whitewater rafting in its
heart-thumping thrills and spills.
</P>
<P>
   Canyoning usually involves roping down into a river gorge, then
riding the fast whitewater by swimming, sliding or jumping from
rock to rock to the eventual safety of dry land. In Europe, the
protective uniform includes a helmet, neoprene wet suit and
slippers, life jacket and climbing harness.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where it is called canyoneering, the sport
is more laid back. For years hikers in southern Utah have been
roping down into narrow sandstone canyons and then walking, wading
and swimming out.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme aspects of the sport caught on a decade and a half
ago in Europe. It remains particularly popular in Switzerland,
Austria and France as an income-producing counterpart to
traditional winter sports.
</P>
<P>
   Canyoning has since taken root in Australia, Brazil, South
Africa and the Caribbean, where the growing popularity of adventure
lures tourists in search of something more exciting than the beach
or handicrafts market.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, a canyoning outfitter, Get Wet,
promises the excitement of ``really letting go, leaping, diving''
near the Jimenoa Falls, finishing up with a 50-foot waterfall
rappel and a 16-foot jump into the local lake to bask in ``a
certain standing applause from the many excursion holidaymakers who
visit here as part of their tourist schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil another outfitter, Grade VI, offers a canyoning course
that includes rappels off powerful waterfalls at Pinheirinho (116
feet) and Saltao (230 feet).
</P>
<P>
   The risks of such a sport are not limited to falls. The worst
danger is posed by flash floods that surge without warning through
narrow canyons with the force of water blasted from a fire hose.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, a flash flood killed 11 hikers in Lower Antelope
Canyon in northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1993, two adults with a Mormon youth group drowned after
they roped down into a 700-foot canyon in Zion National Park in
southern Utah and began working their way downstream; another adult
and five teen-agers were stranded on a ledge for four perilous
days. The party was unaware that floodgates had opened at the head
of the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Cheto Olais, the chief ranger at Zion, said that perhaps 10
percent of the park's 2.8 million visitors a year engage in
canyoneering. ``It's basically climbing, hiking, rappelling and
swimming in cold, cold water, because some of these slot canyons
never see the sun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most canyoneers at Zion, he said, were experienced enough not to
go out when there are thunderstorms to trigger flash floods. ``They
have to determine whether they want to pursue it or back off,''
Ranger Olais said. ``We try to provide a wilderness experience and
there's some inherent danger from Mother Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lee, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service, said it
only permitted canyoneering at Zion and Canyonlands National Parks
in southern Utah. Outward Bound, the National Outdoor Wilderness
Leadership School and other prominent outdoor-skills programs do
not teach canyoneering. Serious climbers and hikers tend to view
the sport, as practiced in Europe at least, as little more than a
stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Williamson, a former chief climbing instructor and program
director for Outward Bound, said extreme canyoneering comes with a
high ``C.T. factor,'' shorthand for cheap thrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a good idea and produces a lot of adrenaline
rush, but there are some consequences,'' said Williamson, who is
now the president of outdoor-oriented Sterling College in
Craftsbury, Vt.

 &HT;    Falun Gong followers alarmed
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Yuan Li spent years studying to be a scientist. He
earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Princeton, studying
under Professor Daniel Tsui, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in
1998. He moved to Duluth, Ga. and got a job as an engineer at
Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I can become the top expert in the field, and still
the knowledge we have is very limited,'' Li said. ``People talk
about how they live life, what they live for. We don't know those
things in physics.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, a friend gave him a book called ``Zhuan
Falun,'' written by Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
   The book was hard to read at first, and it seemed illogical. But
Li read it again, carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, I thought, `Oh, this book has a lot of answers to
this, and it's very convincing,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He began performing the prescribed exercises _ once a week, at
first, then every morning. His energy improved. He needed less
sleep. His allergies disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   He had become a practitioner of a discipline called Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a few million other people.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong has only existed publicly (adherents say the
knowledge is ancient) since 1992. Yet the discipline has spread
around the world. In China, where Yuan Li grew up, the group
estimates it has 70 to 100 million members, though the Chinese
government estimate is 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, the government obviously feels threatened.
</P>
<P>
   After April 25, when more than 10,000 practitioners of Falun
Gong surrounded the Communist Party's leadership compound in
Beijing to protest the arrests of practitioners, the government
ignored the group, pretending that the largest protest since those
at Tiananmen Square a decade ago had simply not happened.
</P>
<P>
   Then the government cracked down. Last week, it banned Falun
Gong, arrested practitioners, incarcerated them in sports stadiums
and launched a televised attempt to discredit Li Hongzhi, the
philosophy's founder.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Xinhua News Agency said earlier this week that
large amounts of the founder's materials had been confiscated
across the country, including more than 73,000 books in Tianjin, a
port near Beijing; 130,000 books and 27,000 audio tapes in Wuhan,
in central China; and 3,200 books and thousands of tapes in Urumqi,
the capital of Xinjiang in the country's far west. Wednesday, the
crackdown intensified, as police in at least 12 provinces raided
book dealers and destroyed hundreds of thousands of the group's
manuals.
</P>
<P>
   All this has U.S. adherents of Falun Gong worried. Practitioners
from around the country have gathered in Washington to exercise and
protest in front of the Chinese Embassy, hoping to avert a more
brutal crackdown, which they fear could include executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got together here to try to let the whole world know about
the critical situation there,'' said Xiaohua Du, a student at
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners say they are not angry about the crackdown _ Falun
Gong calls for an end to anger _ but they are sad and concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Participants from 30 states, including Yuan Li, will hold a news
conference in Washington today in front of the U.S. Capitol _
preceded and followed by rounds of Falun Gong exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe in Falun Gong maintain that the group is
neither religious nor political.
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer numbers of adherents are enough to prompt the
Chinese government to worry, said Yawei Liu, associate director of
the China Village Elections Project at the Atlanta-based Carter
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, reached by telephone in China, said he thinks Falun Gong's
estimate of its numbers is wildly inflated. But he also thinks the
government's estimate is far too low.
</P>
<P>
   The group has grown so fast, Liu said, because it appeals to
those who feel weak and dispossessed, those ``who feel disgusted
with government policy or sort of feel insecure in society.''
</P>
<P>
   China, Liu said, has many such people. ``And once they get
organized, they could become a very viable political force.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that, despite denials of political aims by those
who practice Falun Gong, some people find the date of their large
protest _ April 25 _ to be significant. On that date in 1989, the
People's Daily ran an editorial describing students protests as a
riot, and the reaction helped fuel the massive protests that took
place that year in Tienanmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Han Park, director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues
at the University of Georgia, said the government is concerned,
too, because historically in China, changes in regime have been
fueled by religious movements. But he said Falun Gong is not an
organized movement, and he thinks the government erred in
attempting to suppress it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of crackdown will in fact facilitate the
cohesiveness of the sect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is Falun Gong? Also called Falun Dafa, it is a new
school of qiqong, a traditional practice that uses exercise and
meditation in an effort to channel unseen forces to improve health,
mixed in with some tenets of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   It was founded by Li Honhzhi, 47, a former grain bureau clerk
who now lives in America, and its growth around the world has been
fueled in part by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Li has said in an interview that he supports the protests by his
``students,'' and that the government, by outlawing Falun Gong,
threatens to lose the confidence of more than 100 million people.
</P>

CLINTON HOSTS BOYS, GIRLS NATION GUESTS

   WASHINGTON _ Draped in red, white, and blue and with a Boys
Nation badge pinned to his chest, Anthony Orlando sat awestruck in
the East Room of the White House Wednesday as he listened to
President Clinton speak about the nobility of public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``His presence just amazed me,'' said the 17-year-old from
Leominster, Mass. ``When he talked, he was so passionate. He just
grasped my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando was in Washington this week, along with 200 other
students from all over the United States, as part of the American
Legion's Boys and Girls Nation. Two boys and two girls from each
state acted as senators, creating and voting on mock legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years ago, Clinton sat in the same room as part of
Boys Nation, listening to a similar speech by President John F.
Kennedy. Clinton then shook hands with Kennedy in the Rose Garden,
and the experience is said to have fueled Clinton's dreams of
becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Kennedy's sentiments, Clinton told the teenagers,
``America is a place that comes with great opportunity, but also
great responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Orlando said he does not think he'll ever run for
president, he said Clinton's speech made him feel less cynical
about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that the president was in a sense just like
everyone else. He probably has the same problems we do and
sometimes worries about the same things,'' Orlando said. ``For some
reason, that makes me respect him and his office so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the student senators debated topics such as gun
control, internet regulation, and US relations with China and
India. When Clinton was part of Boys Nation in 1963, he acted as a
senator from Arkansas and helped pass a mock civil rights bill, one
year before the actual Civil Rights Act passed in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The president told the students that Kennedy had congratulated
him and the other student senators who passed the mock legislation
for ``doing what real senators weren't able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting how the Civil Rights Act has created opportunities for
many women and minorities in America, Clinton told the students
they should hold similar foresights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gift of life doesn't always fall according to a rational
plan,'' Clinton told them. ``The great test is to make the most of
every day, but still sow the seeds for tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Students from the New England area said their experience in
Washington has shed a positive light on the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have a cynical view of politics,'' said Jesse Lore,
17, of Londonderry, N.H. ``But when I was out there debating over
legislation, I realize that real senators must also argue with the
same kind of passion. That made me respect them more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has convinced me that public service is a
wonderfully noble thing,'' Orlando said. ``I definitely want to
serve my community is some way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Gupta, 16, of Westborough, Mass., said she learned ``how
utterly difficult achieving bipartisanship is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gupta described herself as a liberal Democrat. ``There are some
issues I just can't be moderate on _ gun control, euthanasia,
abortion. Some things, it's hard to find a middle ground. Now I see
why Congress has so much trouble agreeing on anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Carr, 17, of Westminster, Mass., said she used to
``shy away from politics because I didn't know how much of an
impact I would make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in Washington, listening to the president, meeting so
many other passionate people, makes me realize I have a voice and
this is something I can see myself doing,'' she said.

 &HT;    U.S. Kashmir policy may sway upcoming elections in India
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The two-month war in Kashmir has ensured the return of
India's last government in upcoming elections, a ranking Indian
Cabinet member said Wednesday. But if the polls were open today, he
joked, Bill Clinton just might be India's next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Minister of Law Ram Jethmalani said Clinton has won millions of
new friends in India by acknowledging ``trespassing'' by Pakistan
and urging the withdrawal of fighters from the Indian side of the
cease-fire line in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has finally won the war is one single statement from your
president for which India will remain eternally grateful,''
Jethmalani said during a one-day stop in Atlanta. ``This kind of
forthright denunciation has never taken place. . . . (It) wipes out
years of a roller coaster ride. Clinton has struck a warm chord.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of three wars between India and Pakistan have been fought
over disputed land in Kashmir. Early this year, hundreds of Islamic
fighters seized Himalayan peaks on India's side of the cease-fire
line. In May, India launched a campaign to evict the guerrillas,
most of whom left after India and Pakistan agreed to halt fighting
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the United States has come to the aid of its Cold
War ally, Pakistan, Jethmalani said. But now that the Soviet threat
is gone, Pakistan's strategic value has diminished while India's
importance as the world's largest democracy has grown, he said.
Clinton's anti-Pakistan position on the conflict was a big feather
in India's cap, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the United States is totally free of the compulsions of
the Cold War,'' Jethmalani said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, also, there is a greater appreciation of the fact that
democracies must swim or sink together. Pakistan today is in a
shambles. It is a millstone around any friend's neck,'' he said,
referring to the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic, Jethmalani said, that Pakistan should be
responsible for bringing back to power India's Bharatiya Janata
Party, whose unwieldy coalition government collapsed in April from
lack of public support, forcing general elections this fall. The
BJP is known to have Hindu nationalist tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Previously-important domestic issues now are taking a backseat
to the victory in Kashmir, providing a big boost for the BJP. A
poll in Saturday's Times of India said most Indians _ 72 percent _
were satisfied with the government's handling of the conflict,
compared with only 21 percent who were unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradoxically, the Pakistanis are the best friends of the
government they hate,'' Jethmalani said.

BRITISH SOCCER CLUB TRIES TO ADD PROFITS TO CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ They were one goal down with less than three minutes to
play and Manchester United seemed doomed. Then, magically, the
fabled British soccer team scored twice to wrest victory from
Germany's Bayern Munich for the European club championship.
</P>
<P>
   That moment in Barcelona in May came after triumphs in the two
most prestigious competitions in England. But it also defined the
central question confronting United, both as a soccer club and as
the most successful player in the increasingly competitive world of
soccer as big business: what do you do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   It is a question that preoccupies not just the team's investors
and marketers, but the television company executives whose battles
to broadcast Europe's elite soccer contests will likely rival the
ferocity of players on the field, as digital technology intensifies
competition for sports broadcasting rights.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday, Britain's Restrictive Practices court rejected a
regulatory challenge to the current $1.03 billion arrangement under
which Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB holds exclusive live-broadcast rights
to the 20-team Premier League, including United _ much to BSkyB's
relief. ``It's a victory for common sense,'' said Vic Wakeling,
head of Sky Sports.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that earns 99 percent of its income in Britain, new
sources of fame and fortune are just about anywhere in the world
where United's fans gather _ from Asia and the Middle East, around
television sets and even on the World Wide Web _ to inject value
into a fairy-tale brand of remarkable reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manchester United,'' said Vange Kourentis, head of the club's
international marketing division, ``is a brand of firsts. We are at
the leading edge of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte and Touche, the accounting firm, has ranked Manchester
United PLC as the world's richest soccer club, generating sales
last year of $143 million, almost $50 million ahead of its nearest
rival, Barcelona in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   BSkyB, the British pay-TV satellite broadcaster 40 percent owned
by Murdoch's News Corp., covets Manchester United so much it tried
to buy the club earlier this year. Its $965.6 million takeover bid
would have given the club access to a huge war chest for the
acquisition of increasingly costly new players. It would also have
given BSkyB a unique platform from which to negotiate rights to
broadcast Manchester United games.
</P>
<P>
   In April, though, regulators blocked the deal, arguing that
ownership would have given BSkyB an unfair advantage in negotiating
broadcast rights. The decision sent United's stock down 15 percent.
And, even after the sporting triumphs one month later, the instant
wisdom said that, as a business, United had nowhere left to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't get any better,'' said a report in The Guardian
newspaper in May that advised stock-holding readers to ``sell the
fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   The judgment reflected some basic uncertainties surrounding the
business of soccer. In a game where success is notoriously fickle,
how can the company behind the players wrest lasting value and
market performance? Indeed, with the sky-rocketing cost of buying
players _ United spent $43.3 million on just three players last
year and its total wages bill increased by a further $6.2 million
to $37.7 million _ where will clubs find the money to remain
competitive on the field and profitable on the balance-sheet?
</P>
<P>
   Since then, though, a new strategy has become increasingly
apparent. Without a big-brother backer like BSkyB, United is
seeking to exploit its well-known brand, pushing to transpose what
it calls ``The Theater of Dreams'' _ as its Old Trafford stadium in
Manchester is known _ into completely new arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the past few months, United managers have struck
franchise deals with outlets in Singapore and Dubai to establish
flagship stores where fans can buy team-branded merchandise, access
United's web site and watch its television station MUTV.
</P>
<P>
   In such distant lands, said Kourentis, the international
marketing chief, ``those flagship stores will be their theater of
dreams and we will take as much as possible to the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when the squad embarked on a tour of Australia and China
this month, virtually the entire senior management went along to
evaluate market openings. The Thai language version of its United
Magazine sells 20,000 copies a month. United reckons it already has
20 million television followers in China, and sees a potential 200
million satellite audience there.
</P>
<P>
   At United's Megastore in Manchester the other day, the brand's
reach was evident enough: Oh Aur Song, a 21-year-old student
visiting from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bought a United T-shirt. The
reason: he watches Premier League games on satellite back home and
United is his favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking behind United's far-flung marketing is clear: the
club's huge following outside Britain offers a mother lode of
merchandising that has yet to be tapped commercially.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still scope for considerably more. It's such a
wonderful brand in many countries in western and eastern Europe,
the Far East and areas such as that,'' said Nigel Hawkins, an
analyst with Williams de Broe brokerage in London.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (Oddly, the United States does not figure in any of United's
plans for expansion. The reason, said Kourentis, is that, while
soccer has an increasingly keen following among American
teen-agers, baseball and American football are simply too popular
to permit soccer to reach a wider audience.)
</P>
<P>
   Neither is the globe itself the limit. On July 15, United
announced the launch of a free Internet service called ManUFree.net
to take the brand into cyberspace and, presumably, e-commerce. The
launch pushed up its stock by 1.5 percent to 225 pence, defying the
doomsayers who said it had peaked a few months earlier at 218.
</P>
<P>
   The club is not neglecting the fans at home either. United has
announced a $46.5 million plan to expand the seating capacity of
the Theater of Dreams from 55,000 to 67,400. The expansion is not
surprising. Last year, United's gate receipts earned the biggest
proportion of its sales at 34 percent, followed by merchandising at
33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, United's existing merchandising is already the envy
of other clubs. At the Megastore in Manchester, shoppers can buy
everything from United-brand wallpaper at $10.80 a roll to hi-fis
at $139 each. And shoppers don't just end their spending in the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, for instance, David and Lesley Gray from
Dumfries, Scotland, took a two-and-a-half hour train ride south to
the Theater of Dreams, with their sons Paul, 7, and Ross, 4. For an
hour, the 44-year-old Scottish police officer and his family
shopped at United's Megastore, dropping around $400 on branded
towels, boxer shorts, posters, T-shirts and replica red and white
uniform for their sons, who craved United jerseys emblazoned with
the name of their hero, midfield superstar David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went back to their room at the United-themed 111-room
Quality Hotel (two-night family special: $320) and planned their
meals at the Red Cafi, as United's branded eatery here is known
(budgeted outlay: $130). And, two days later, they went home, their
hearts full and their wallets $1,000 lighter. ``It was a treat for
the kids,'' Gray said, slightly defensively.

VOTE-BUYING ALLEGATIONS SWIRL AROUND IOWA STRAW POLL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The credibility of next month's Iowa straw poll of
Republican presidential candidates was thrown into turmoil
Wednesday when the head of the state's Christian Coalition traded
charges with the Steve Forbes campaign about allegations of
vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
   In a charge that stunned the presidential field, Iowa Christian
Coalition chairman Bobbie Lee Gobel alleged that a Forbes aide
tried to hire 500 people from her temporary-worker company in an
effort to win next month's straw poll. The Forbes campaign strongly
denied the allegation, saying it was ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegation could not be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   But with little more than two weeks before the Aug. 14 vote in
Ames, Iowa, the accusation highlighted the way campaigns sometimes
cover the costs for supporters who go to the straw poll. Most
campaigns openly admit they pay the $25 entrance fee and
transportation expenses, but they deny they are ``paying'' for
votes. The poll is variously viewed as politically meaningless or
as an important test of organizational strength in the state that
holds the first caucus of the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel, the owner of Metro Temp in Des Moines, is one of the most
sought-after political figures in Iowa. Although the Christian
Coalition doesn't endorse candidates, individual leaders of the
organization often do. As a result, many presidential candidates
have courted Gobel, hoping she could persuade the state's
influential anti-abortion community to follow her to the polls.
Gobel said she has not endorsed any candidate, but she has met
several of them. For example, on Gobel's birthday, Elizabeth Dole
took Gobel and her family to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Gobel said a senior Forbes aide called
her in February and sought to hire 500 people from her firm who
would vote for Forbes in the straw poll. She said the call came
from Jerry Keen, the former chairman of the Georgia Christian
Coalition who now is a top Forbes aide.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel said Keen inquired about hiring 500 ``temps'' who would be
paid for four hours of work, during which they would vote for
Forbes at the straw poll. Gobel said she took down the order but
never processed it. She said she discussed it with the Iowa board
of the Iowa Christian Coalition and concluded such an act would be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to hire temps to go and vote for Steve Forbes,''
Gobel said.
</P>
<P>
   But Keen adamantly denied the allegation, saying he did talk to
Gobel in February and on several occasions, but he never said
anything about hiring temporary workers to vote for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely, unequivocally false,'' Keen said. He said
Gobel was upset with the Forbes campaign because it had hired the
executive director of the Iowa Christian Coalition, who still has
not been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel indicated that she is not a fan of Forbes by noting that,
despite his own vehement opposition to abortion, he served as
co-chairman for the campaign of New Jersey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman, who supports abortion rights. ``He co-chaired Christie
Todd Whitman, the mother of all the baby-killers,'' Gobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel said she is looking for ``a Godly candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' political director, Bill Dal Col, said the campaign
never approached Gobel or anyone else about hiring temporary
workers to vote for the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never happened,'' Dal Col said. ``She is embarrassing
herself and her organization. We are building a grass-roots
organization for a candidate who favors tax cuts and is pro-life.
We are not paying anyone to go to a straw vote.'' Dal Col said the
campaign is only paying for the $25 tickets and transportation
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ione Dilley, the former chairman of the Iowa Christian Coalition
who appointed Gobel to the post last November, said Gobel mentioned
the allegations to her several months ago. But Dilley said she did
not have any first-hand knowledge about whether they were true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down to one person's word against the other,'' Dilley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa Republican Party,
said Gobel is a ``credible person who is relatively new to Iowa,''
although he stressed he could not verify Gobel's allegations. He
said the Christian Coalition is ``a very powerful force in Iowa
politics and . . . growing. Bobbie is a good organizer within the
conservative Christian community, and that is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he still thinks the straw poll is ``very credible''
since only Iowans can vote, unlike in 1995 when people from across
the country were able to participate.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 Iowans are expected to vote in the straw poll.
While the vote is meaningless in the actual race for delegates to
the national Republican convention next year, it has turned into a
powerful political draw as numerous candidates have said their
performance in Ames is a crucial test.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, who has raised $37 million in
campaign funds this year, and Forbes, who is using his own fortune
to match Bush, are spending heavily in the Iowa contest. Forbes,
for example, just launched a $10 million advertising campaign,
concentrating heavily on Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Lamar Alexander has only $90,000 cash on hand and
could be forced to drop out of the race if he does poorly in the
straw poll. Wednesday, Alexander spent some of his money on an Iowa
television ad that targets Bush, with a mock newscast suggesting
that the presidency is being auctioned to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bush tried to get around campaign spending
limits by having friends pay $50,000 directly to the Iowa
Republican Party for tickets to the straw poll, plus $43,000 to
rent a prominent patch of lawn outside the convention hall where
the straw vote is taking place. After much criticism, Bush agreed
to pay for both expenditures from his campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later announced he would not take matching federal campaign
funds, which means he doesn't have to abide by the $1.3 million
spending limit in Iowa. Forbes also is rejecting federal matching
funds and spending freely.

COMMENTARY: LESSONS FROM YOSEMITE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif, N.J.)  (rk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crime-fighting is not always about justice. Too often when a
crime is committed, the so-called criminal justice professionals
feel compelled not to find out what really happened, but simply to
arrest and prosecute somebody. Anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently the wrong person is arrested. But once a suspect is
in custody, investigators give far more credence to information
that might be incriminating than anything that might indicate the
wrong person has been apprehended. Nobody likes to admit fouling
up.
</P>
<P>
   The beheading of a 26-year-old naturalist in Yosemite National
Park is as clear an illustration as you are likely to get of the
horrific problems associated with this tendency of criminal justice
officials to rush to judgment, and their reluctance to admit error.
</P>
<P>
   Those who profess to be tough on crime and are unmoved by the
plight of people wrongfully imprisoned might at least consider that
when you lock up the wrong person the real criminal remains at
large.
</P>
<P>
   The mutilated body of Joie Ruth Armstrong was found last
Thursday in a drainage ditch not far from her home in a remote
section of Yosemite. This week the FBI announced that a motel
handyman named Cary Stayner had been arrested and charged with her
murder, and that he was also responsible for the murders in
February of a woman and two teen-age girls who were visiting the
park.
</P>
<P>
   This was a curious and unsettling development because the FBI
had been insisting for many weeks that the people responsible for
the three February murders were already in custody. There were
reports that one of the men being held had confessed and that
incriminating fiber evidence had been found.
</P>
<P>
   As late as last Friday, FBI officials were saying they did not
think the murder of Ms. Armstrong was linked to the February
murders. Cary Stayner had been routinely questioned about the
earlier case but FBI officials sent him on his way. Their sights
were set elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   What is dangerous is not the fact that mistakes are being made,
but the frequency with which they are made, and the fact that the
simplistic, get-tough approach to law enforcement that is so
prevalent in the U.S. ensures that they will continue to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Americans seldom hear that eyewitness identifications are
notoriously unreliable, that confessions are frequently bogus, that
much of the ``scientific'' hair and fiber analysis that is so
heavily relied upon in criminal cases is a joke, or that
prosecutors in jurisdictions from coast to coast are building cases
on the lying testimony of jailhouse snitches who would send their
own mothers to prison if they could get something in return.
</P>
<P>
   Catastrophic errors and outright corruption are tainting some of
the nation's most serious criminal cases, including many that carry
sentences of life in prison or death. But most of what we hear
about the criminal justice system are demands that it get even
tougher, that more people should be sent to prison, and more
prisoners should be sent to the death chambers, and fewer prisoners
should be freed for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday a prominent New Jersey prosecutor, Patricia Hurt, was
stripped of her powers by the governor, Christie Whitman. Ms. Hurt
was caught up in a scandal that involved, among other things, the
refusal for six days to check the alibi of an innocent man who was
arrested and accused of murdering a police officer in Orange.
Another innocent man picked up in the same case died in police
custody.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hurt would never have been brought down solely for that
flagrant miscarriage of justice. Trust me. She was also accused of
mishandling her department's budget, of misusing drug forfeiture
money and using office employees for personal chores.
</P>
<P>
   It was the alleged misuse of funds, the lavish spending, that
caused her downfall. The fact that she was willing to look the
other way while a patently innocent man, Terrance Everett, was kept
in custody for nearly a week _ a week in which the real cop killer
remained on the loose _ would never have forced her from power.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous array of abuses within the criminal justice system
is a horribly festering sore, and nobody wants to peel off the
scab. I can understand that. The reality is awful, much worse than
a handful of murders in Yosemite.

CANCER SOCIETY WITHDRAWS SPONSORSHIP FOR GROUP SUPPORTING STEM CELL
RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lobbying over the issue of human embryonic stem cell research
has generated so much controversy that the American Cancer Society
has withdrawn its sponsorship of Patients' Cure, a group founded to
publicize the medical benefits of stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal occurred after Cardinal William Keeler of
Baltimore wrote the cancer society to urge it to reconsider its
position. Whether the letter influenced the society's decision is
in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, in at least one instance, pledges to the cancer
society to support breast cancer research were returned by a Roman
Catholic group, which told the society of its moral opposition to
stem cell research, a Catholic church official said.
</P>
<P>
   Human embryonic stem cells are derived from the surplus embryos
generated at in vitro fertilization clinics. The cells, which can
give rise to all kinds of human tissue, arouse strong emotions
among those opposed to abortion because human embryos must be
destroyed to obtain them.
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops has lobbied Congress
not to allow federal money to be used for research on the cells,
fearing that the government would otherwise appear to approve of
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists hope that embryonic stem cells will serve as an
all-purpose repair kit for a variety of serious diseases, and
Patients' Cure, which began operating in May, is a coalition of
medical research groups that hopes to persuade Congress to let
embryonic stem cell research proceed under guidelines being devised
by the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer society, which receives more than $500 million a year
in public donations, was a part of the coalition until this month.
Daniel Perry, the chairman of Patients' Cure, said he was told that
the society ``wanted to take a lower profile,'' although it still
agreed that stem cell research should be financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, they had had a protest at a fund-raiser,'' said
Perry, who has since dropped the cancer society's name from the
Patients' Cure list of sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal request did not come directly from the cancer
society but from Myrl Weinberg, president of the National Health
Council, a lobbying group in Washington. Ms. Weinberg did not cite
fund-raising problems, but rather pressure from the Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer society, she said, had received ``tremendous response
from people within the Catholic community expressing concern''
about stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John R. Seffrin, chief executive of the Cancer Society,
``agreed to meet with a person high in the Catholic community,''
Ms. Weinberg said. After that meeting, she added, the society said
it wanted to take a lower public profile while it re-examined its
position on the research.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he did not doubt Ms. Weinberg's authority to relay
the society's views because Seffrin also is the chairman of Ms.
Weinberg's organization.
</P>
<P>
   Seffrin was not available for comment. Greg Donaldson, the
Cancer Society's national vice president of public relations, said
the society had withdrawn from Patients' Cure because of a policy
disagreement and not because of pressure from the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lent our name to Patients' Cure in May,'' Donaldson said,
adding that the intention was only to oppose general restrictions
on research and not for any specific position on stem cells, an
issue on which the society is still developing its views. ``It was
an error to allow them to represent our position on stem cell
research,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perry said the position of Patients' Cure on stem cells had not
changed since it was founded.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said the Cancer Society and the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops had exchanged letters, but he denied that there
had been any suggestion that donations might be at risk. ``There
have been no threats made and no disruption of funds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Doerflinger, associate director for policy development
at the bishops conference, said he knew of an instance where
pledges for a breast cancer fund-raiser were returned after
families learned of the Cancer Society's support for stem cell
research. The families also met with members of the society's
Washington office, but the dispute over the pledges ``was not
something that we promoted,'' Doerflinger said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, letters were exchanged between Seffrin and Keeler,
chairman of the Committee for Pro-Life Activities at the bishops
conference, Doerflinger said. The letter from the cardinal asked
the Cancer Society to reconsider its position as a supporter of
federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the letter had suggested that donations to the Cancer
Society might be at risk, Doerflinger said: ``No, I don't work that
way. We just argue the issue on its merits. Obviously, our goal is
not to reduce funds for cancer research.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said other organizations in the Patients' Cure coalition
had come under pressure, but only the Cancer Society had withdrawn
its support. Publicly supported groups have difficulty taking sides
on controversial issues, Perry said, ``but I applaud those small
groups which are vulnerable to pressure for sticking by their
guns.''

 &HT;    Dan Reeves: `We'll get the job done'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The absence of All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson annoyed
Falcons coach Dan Reeves, although Reeves was smiling Wednesday
afternoon on the eve of his third training camp with the team.
Reeves answered several questions about defending the NFC
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does this team stand compared with last season's team?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are some questions we didn't have this time last year _
replacing (wide receiver) Tony Martin (who was released), and if
Jamal doesn't come in, that becomes a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can this team replicate the chemistry it had last year? Does
Anderson's situation threaten that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's something you don't have any control over. As far as our
chemistry here, we'll get the job done somehow. It certainly is a
distraction, though. People are focusing on why Jamal is not here,
what is happening with the contract _ all that rather than
preparing for (the season-opener with) Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can your staff do to help preserve that chemistry?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just bring in the right kind of people, the kind of people
who work hard and do the right things on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Anderson's absence, who becomes the top running back?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're going to have to be careful with Byron Hanspard (who
missed last season with a serious knee injury), but he's close to
being 100 percent. (Second-year man) Ken Oxendine is the other guy
you have to look at, because he was there last year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can this team repeat as NFC West champion without Anderson?
Would there be sufficient confidence in the locker room to face a
much tougher schedule?
</P>
<P>
   A: If anything, you wonder if you've got enough talent to do it.
I think we have the kind of guys who know what it takes. It's all
about controlling your division. You still play very similar
schedules within the division. The bye (in the first week of the
playoffs) is very important to us because our last regular-season
game is on a Monday (at home against the 49ers). It would be a
short week (if the Falcons didn't get it).
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's sounds as though you're planning to make the playoffs,
even with the question at wide receiver, and the fact that Keith
Brooking will take over for leading tackler Cornelius Bennett at
weak-side linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   A: We feel much more comfortable that we've got somebody who can
step in for Cornelius (who was waived to save money.). There just
aren't many Tony Martin types out there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The closing of the Falcon Inn hotel necessitated the move of
training camp from team headquarters in Suwanee. Most NFL teams go
away for camp. Is this good or bad?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd say being at home is the best scenario of all, but if you
have to be away, this is the best distance. Families can come up on
the players' day off. It's just a two-hour drive. And this is a
marvelous facility.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any lasting effects from your open-heart surgery in December?
</P>
<P>
   A: I feel great, but I wish it was a lot cooler.

 &HT;    Falcons finding the good and bad of new camp
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ It's nice here where the Piedmont meets the
foothills of the Smoky Mountains, and the apartments Falcons
players are staying in during training camp are new. They even get
golf carts to get around.
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks to moving camp from team headquarters in
Suwanee to here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every evening after meetings (in Suwanee) I would go home and
visit with my wife and daughter, which was just five minutes away
(in Duluth),'' said wide receiver Terance Mathis, who brought a TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a beautiful campus, and I think it's great some
people who normally wouldn't get to see us practice can.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to Furman, where the Falcons held training camp from
1971-78 before the Suwanee facility opened, was a must. The Falcon
Inn hotel _ where players lived during camp from 1979-98 _ closed
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no relief from the heat. It was 95 degrees
Wednesday, and more of the same is in store for the first practice
at 3 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule not fixed
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's midnight curfew was a loose one, as players
technically do not have to report until 9 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   There will be practices at 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. Friday. There
is tentatively an afternoon practice Saturday, but that could be
moved to morning, or there could be two practices.
</P>
<P>
   All practices, and the controlled practice with the Jacksonville
Jaguars on Aug. 7, will be open to the public. Sunday is a day off.
</P>
<P>
   Lend an arm
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons/Red Cross blood drive will be noon until 6 p.m. Aug.
6-7 at Akers Mill Square, Gwinnett Mall Corners and Southlake
Festival malls.
</P>
<P>
   Participants will receive a pair of tickets to the preseason
opener Aug. 13 against Detroit in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Field of fools
</P>
<P>
   The media played like media with bumbling errors, miserable
pop-ups and dubious baserunning in Wednesday's 5-0 loss to the
Falcons staff, perhaps the only shutout in slow-pitch softball
history.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Dana Stuart is fat. She's not overweight, plump, or
chubby, or any other euphemism meant to politely describe her large
frame. She's just fat. And she likes it that way.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a time when she couldn't bring herself to say the
f-word, like the time her parents enrolled her in Weight Watchers
at age 9 and she stood dwarfed by women who were fighting lifelong
battles with their weight. Or the time when her father forced her
to jog alongside the family car for exercise, frustrated with his
daughter's escalating size.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says the word without shame or reservation. Fat.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a black mesh bodysuit with fuchsia feathers at the
wrists and her long red hair flowing down her back, she proudly
displayed the roundness of her form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm fat. So what? That doesn't mean that I have to be
miserable, that I have to wear a big polyester moo-moo and hate
myself,'' the 31-year-old Californian said Wednesday. ``If my fairy
godmother were to come and wisk away the pounds, sure I would
choose to be thin. But that's not going to happen, so I choose to
be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart is one of nearly 500 people who have flocked to
Framingham, Mass. this week for the 30th anniversary convention of
the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance. Some were
fearlessly fat, sporting thong bikinis at a private pool party.
Others were slowly coming out of their shell, attempting to shed
years of self-consciousness and shame. NAAFA president Bettye
Travis said they had gathered for one purpose: to tell the world
that being fat is fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all taught to be ashamed of being fat. We were all
taught that fat people are stupid or worthless, but we aren't
buying that anymore,'' said Travis. ``No matter what your size, you
deserve respect. That is what we are hoping to get people to
realize, that being fat is not a crime. It's what we are and we are
proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance is a
Sacramento-based nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the
quality of life for fat people through education, advocacy, and
member support. The group's 4,000 members participate in regional
and national activities that work to affirm their self-worth and
dispel the negative connotations of being overweight. The last 30
years have brought about some progress, Travis said, but the
struggle against stereotyping and discrimination continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still fighting the fight of size discrimination. Things
have changed a bit but we still have people losing their jobs
because they are fat or kids who are taunted in class because of
their weight, so the battle rages on,'' she explained. ``I have two
young daughters who I fear will one day struggle with dieting and
it is for them that I do this the most, so that they can be
accepted for who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis said the hard part for most people who join the group is
coming to terms with the fact that they are overweight. This was
true for Jeanete DePattie, a 30-year-old marketing executive from
St. Louis who said she tried just about every weight-loss pill,
shake, and cream _ to no avail. When she finally decided to accept
her weight, she said she found an inner peace that had always
escaped her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always attached my self-worth to weight. Then I found
out that about 2 to 10 percent of those who diet keep the weight
off, which meant that I had a 2 to 10 percent chance of being
happy, and I wasn't willing to accept that,'' DePattie said.
``There was a sense of hopelessness that came with every diet and I
became fatter and more unhealthy each time. So I decided to just
eat what I want and exercise and try to be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Ahlers, an exercise physiologist in Newton, said
people should not accept obesity and resign themselves to a
lifetime of medical complications as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excess weight brings about numerous increased health risks
such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and joint and orthopedic
complications, all of which can be reduced by losing weight,'' she
said. ``I don't believe that overweight people can't change their
metabolism through behavior modification and lose weight. I'm not
saying they are going to be thin, but they shouldn't just sort of
say, `I'm overweight and that's just how it has to be,' because
it's not true. It doesn't have to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues being discussed at the convention: the drive
for national legislation to make size discrimination a civil rights
violation. Michigan is the only state that has such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Wann, publisher of FAT!SO? magazine, was host Wednesday
of a women-only Fat Body Art workshop that invited participants to
explore the joy of round forms by painting each other's nude
bodies. The idea, she said, is to help fat women see the beauty in
other fat women in hopes that they will realize the beauty in
themselves. Standing with her hot pink and turquoise hair and black
sandals, without a stitch of clothing covering her 5-foot-4,
270-pound frame, she said being fat gets more fun with each layer
of shame she sheds.
</P>
<P>
   She referred to the convention as a family reunion, saying that
fat people are rarely in a situation where they are in the
majority. She said the week is about fat liberation, fat pride, and
fat power, more than just acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people to come out as a fat person _ use the f-word. I
know it's scary but do it anyway,'' she said. ``People tell us to
lose weight but I say `What if we don't want to be thin? What if we
just want to be who were are?' I tell them that instead of going to
Jenny Craig and giving her $1,000, go buy a killer wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Wann added, ``I don't envy thin people. I don't see one walking
down the street and wonder why not me. I think they look great . .
. I think I look great too.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in the Senate turned aside a Democratic
plan Wednesday to limit the size of their proposed tax cut, even as
centrists from both parties laid out a middle ground on which a
compromise could eventually be forged.
</P>
<P>
   But as Republicans moved closer to Senate passage of the largest
tax cut since 1981, they suffered a quirky procedural defeat that
in theory would force them to rescind their tax reductions in 10
years, just after they fully take effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of debate in the Senate on how big a tax cut
the nation can afford in an era of anticipated federal budget
surpluses, Republicans made a case for sending as much excess
revenue as possible back to taxpayers while Democrats warned that
too big a reduction would wreak havoc with the economy, favor the
wealthy and starve vital government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans and a few Democrats were pushing for
legislation that would cut taxes by $792 billion over 10 years,
using the bulk of the nearly $1 trillion in projected surpluses
over the next decade that the two parties agree are up for grabs.
The House passed a tax cut last week along party lines that is the
same size but which is made up of different provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``After paying for the government programs for which Congress
has planned and budgeted, the change must now be returned to the
taxpayer,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the chairman of the
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has threatened to veto either version, saying
both would risk a return to budget deficits and limit Washington's
ability to shore up the ailing Social Security and Medicare
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has opened the door to negotiations, and has
countered the Republican plan with an offer of a tax cut of up to
$300 billion, a figure supported by most Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not mislead the American people by promising them
massive tax cuts which may well be based only on phantom surpluses
which never materialize,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. ``Even if
the surpluses do happen, this Republican tax cut plan could
emasculate national security, public investments and the operations
of government.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of 10 centrist Democrats and Republicans sought to kick
start the process of finding a middle ground Wednesday by proposing
a $500 billion compromise plan that includes elements sought by
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Based on preliminary votes Wednesday, Republicans appeared to
have the votes they need to pass their $792 billion plan in the
Senate by the end of this week. They defeated an attempt by
Democrats to limit the tax cut to $290 billion over 10 years on a
60-39 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans suffered at least a symbolic setback when they
were unable to sidestep a rule _ written at a time when Congress
was intent on limiting the growth of budget deficits _ that makes
it difficult to pass tax cuts that remain in effect for more than
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The rule essentially bars any provisions in a tax or budget bill
that results in the government losing revenue after the first 10
years, which a net tax cut of the sort under consideration by both
parties does by definition.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans asked for a waiver of the rule, a step that
requires 60 votes. But they could muster only 51 votes, while all
45 Democrats and three moderate Republicans voted to keep the rule
in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Senate bill become law _ an unlikely prospect given
Clinton's veto threat _ it would phase in most of its tax cuts
gradually over the next decade as the projected budget surplus
increases. The cuts would then remain in effect permanently. But
under the budget rule, the entire tax cut would be rescinded after
2009.
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect would not necessarily be so dire for
Republicans, who could pass new budget rules in future sessions of
Congress or could pass legislation extending the tax cuts past
2009.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, any compromise tax proposals will
require bipartisan support to become law, and any deal between the
Republican leadership and Clinton would likely bring along enough
Democrats in the Senate to get over the 60-vote hurdle needed to
waive the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harshly partisan tone of Wednesday's debate in the
Senate, the $500 billion compromise plan advanced by five
Republicans and five Democrats suggested some willingness to reach
a deal, though probably not until after Congress finishes passing
some version of the current Republican proposals and Clinton vetoes
it.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors of the compromise measure, which is likely to be
considered by the Senate on Thursday, said their plan has almost no
chance of being adopted at this point. But they said it could be
the basis for negotiations between the White House and Congress,
probably starting in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're serious about passing a tax cut this year, I believe
this alternative is the right way to go,'' said Sen. John Chafee,
R-R.I., one of the sponsors of the $500 billion compromise. ``If we
are successful, I believe the final package will look a lot like
our bipartisan alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Republicans backing the compromise plan were Sens.
James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and Susan
Collins and Olympia Snow, both of Maine. The Democrats were Sens.
John Breaux and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
John Edwards of North Carolina and Evan Bayh of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 billion plan would substantially increase the standard
deduction, providing a $283 billion cut in personal income taxes
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the current $7,200 deduction for married couples
filing jointly would be increased to $11,550 and the current $4,300
standard deduction for single filers would increase to $5,600.
Since upper-income households usually itemize their deductions, the
change would primarily benefit lower- and middle-income households.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise package would also reduce the so-called marriage
penalty, which leaves many two-income couples paying more in taxes
than they would if they were single and living together. It would
include a modest reduction in capital gains taxes and in
inheritance taxes on large estates, and would provide tax breaks
for education and the purchase of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the $792 billion Senate Republican plan is a
reduction in the current 15 percent personal income tax bracket to
14 percent and an expansion of the 14 percent bracket to higher
income levels.
</P>
<P>
   The $290 billion Democratic alternative that was rejected by the
Senate on Wednesday was built around an increase in the standard
deduction for personal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans remained on the defensive Wednesday over comments
made by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Repeating a
message he first sent to Congress last week, Greenspan told the
Senate Banking Committee that Congress would be ``better off
holding off on a tax cut immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said there is no certainty that the projected
surpluses will materialize, and that the economy would benefit more
from reducing the national debt than from tax cuts. But he said he
would prefer tax cuts to using the surplus for additional
government spending.

CALDWELL WILL GO TO ARKANSAS FOR ACADEMIC POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Sarah Caldwell, founder and artistic director of the
Opera Company of Boston, has accepted an appointment as
distinguished professor at the University of Arkansas in
Fayetteville. She will head the opera department there.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, now 75, founded the opera company in 1958 and during
the subsequent three decades made Boston an international operatic
capital, a center of both innovation and scholarly attention to
tradition. Because of the tangle of financial, legal, and
public-safety issues surrounding her theater, the Opera House on
Washington Street, Caldwell's company has been inactive since the
world premiere of Robert di Domenica's ``The Balcony'' in June
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Caldwell has repeatedly tried to revive her company,
whose strongest hope remains a project announced by the Theatre
Management Group Inc. in Houston, which has applied for permits to
restore and reopen the Opera House. (The local representative of
Theatre Management Group was not available for a progress report
Wednesday.) Caldwell recently sold her home in Lincoln and has
moved to an apartment near the Opera House. She is also house
hunting in Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Fayetteville, Caldwell said, ``This new situation
will allow me to do some very interesting things; we will have
students of conducting and stage direction working alongside the
voice students, and we will be able to do productions. The fall
term opens August 23, and I will start hearing the singers then in
order to determine what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell is pleased to renew her association with a university
where her stepfather, Dr. Henry Alexander, served as professor of
government and political science, and where she briefly studied as
a psychology student. ``Another nice thing is that the chairman of
the music department, Stephen Gates, is a cellist who used to play
in the Opera Company Orchestra and toured with the American
National Opera Company when I ran that. There is also a wonderful
new chancellor of the university who seemed to want to do some of
the same things I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of her career, Caldwell chaired the opera
department at Boston University, and for years she hoped to make
the Opera Company of Boston a major center of operatic training,
and in fact many of the movers and shakers of today's operatic
world passed through its doors. She is writing a book about her
vision for opera, and she says, looks forward to the Arkansas
opportunity to put some of her educational ideas into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell says she will continue her activity as principal guest
conductor of the Ural Philharmonic in Ekaterinburg, in Russia. In
the last few years she has also been involved in a project to
transcribe and publish 72 ancient Chinese and Japanese musical
scrolls that were discovered in the 1970s. In September, she will
be in Cambridge, England, to record and film some of this music.
The pipa virtuoso Wu Man, who appeared at Tanglewood this week, is
also involved in the project and will participate in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell was unaware of any change in the status of plans to
reopen the Opera House. ``There was one legal problem still to
resolve, but I think everything there was proceeding nicely. I
would not be sitting here in Fayetteville if I thought the job
would interfere with the work I am planning for Boston. My new job
is a very interesting and important thing to be doing, and it
allows my work in Russia, in England, and in Boston to continue.''

MARKET PLACE: CHALLENGES TO NASDAQ LOOM LARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During the past year, Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, has struck deals to buy
the American Stock Exchange, forged alliances with three overseas
bourses and promised investors 24-hour access to the Nasdaq stock
market. And at an NASD board meeting Thursday, Zarb will present
his plan for making the Nasdaq market a for-profit, publicly held
company separate from its regulatory unit.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Zarb has been busy. But has he been effective?
</P>
<P>
   This question is being raised by people both inside and outside
the NASD following the flurry of activity. As the Nasdaq stock
market faces increased competition from well-capitalized private
companies running electronic communications networks, or ECNs, the
effectiveness of the NASD chairman is more crucial than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what Zarb is trying to do,'' said Patrick J. Healy,
president of the Issuer Network, a company in Chevy Chase, Md.,
that advises public companies on where they should list their
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think their ability to get these things running smoothly
is less than stellar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges to the NASD certainly loom large. The business of
who facilitates investors' securities trading and ensures that the
participants abide by the rules is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   As for Zarb, he argues that the NASD is setting the pace. ``I
think we're leading the parade,'' he said. ``Not everybody always
agrees with me. I think we've responded to events and maybe even
gotten a little ahead of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But he will have to run faster and faster just to keep up. New
competitors are entering the business almost weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Any moves the NASD may want to make are hindered by its
considerable infrastructure. By definition, an entity that is both
a market and a regulator to thousands of brokerage firms across the
nation cannot be as nimble as startups with no regulatory
obligations. ``It's like dealing with the old AT&AMP;T,'' said Alan
Davidson, president of the Independent Broker-Dealer Association.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons an offering of stock in Nasdaq is compelling
is that some of the proceeds would be used to fund the regulatory
unit, which would be spun off.
</P>
<P>
   Frank E. Baxter, chairman of Jefferies &AMP; Co., a brokerage firm
based in Los Angeles and a NASD board member, concedes there are
challenges. ``I think that events externally and internally are
moving extremely rapidly,'' Baxter said. ``We have a large
battleship, and it's going to take a tremendous amount of will to
get where we should be. I feel confident that the board and the
membership has that will.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the captain of this battleship, the pace of
change in the industry poses a greater threat to Nasdaq than to its
archrival, the New York Stock Exchange, which announced its own
plans to go public last week. Trading on ECNs now accounts for 30
percent of Nasdaq stock market volume; every trade that takes place
on an electronic network is one less trade handled by a Nasdaq
market maker firm. Electronic networks trade less than 5 percent of
New York Stock Exchange volume.
</P>
<P>
   While electronic networks do not represent a total loss for the
NASD _ trades executed on a network can still produce revenues for
Nasdaq in the form of fees for using its Selectnet system or small
order execution system. But the 30 percent of volume traded on ECNs
definitely hurts the large brokerage firms that make markets in
Nasdaq stocks. These firms are one of Zarb's biggest and most
powerful constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   And if electronic networks become exchanges where companies can
list their shares, this will cut into the fees Nasdaq receives from
companies whose stocks it trades. These charges accounted for 19
percent of the NASD's $739.5 million in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   Those who worry about whether the NASD is slipping behind say
that Zarb has great vision, but that his ability to follow through
quickly on plans is not up to the same standard.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, Zarb is coming under fire from members of the
American Stock Exchange, which merged with the NASD last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis D. Lowenfels, a former member of the Amex board, advised
the exchange's floor brokers on the NASD merger. On Wednesday, he
said: ``There is widespread dissatisfaction amongst Amex floor
members with the failure of Nasdaq to fulfill some of the promises
they made to induce the merger. I think it's important that Nasdaq
management begin to address these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the promises was an aggressive sales team that would
deliver at least 100 new companies to list their shares on the Amex
in the first quarter of this year. In reality, only 40 new
companies had listed as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Zarb acknowledged that the initial goal was too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time ever where we're combining the
specialist system with the multimarket-maker system _ giving
issuers the choice,'' he said. ``We're redefining that process as
we go along. Given six months, our report card is pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   A new team has been formed at the Amex to attract listings.
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore F. Sodano, chief operating officer at the NASD is
overseeing the Amex merger. He called the complaints ``a lot of
big-time baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're not hearing about are all the other things we've
done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited several examples, including a huge investment in
technology that has brought down the number of system failures on
the floor, a sales effort to bring more corporate bonds and foreign
issues to list on the exchange, and the development of 27 new types
of derivatives to be traded on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another area of concern is the inability of the NASD to bring to
fruition its proposal for a centralized customer order system that
would allow investors to meet without the interference of a dealer,
as they increasingly do now on ECNs. The proposal has languished
ever since going to the SEC for approval 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   That stalemate is a testament to one of Zarb's biggest
challenges _ the warring factions that make up the NASD Large
market maker firms, afraid that a central limit order book would
cut into the profits they made executing customers' trades in
Nasdaq stocks, objected to the plan with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   With Zarb unable to overcome the opposition, the NASD is now in
the position of scrambling to keep up with electronic networks. And
to add insult to injury, some of the same firms that objected to
the central order book concept are now investors in the networks.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the matters that will come before the board at Thursday's
meeting is an improved version of the limit order book.
</P>
<P>
   In response, owners of small firms are becoming increasingly
vocal in their criticism of the NASD, arguing that it is too
ossified and bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't appear to know how to run a business,'' said
Davidson of Zeus Securities. ``They have lost 23 percent of their
membership in 10 years and 30 percent of Nasdaq business to ECNs.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zarb is hoping that turning Nasdaq into a for-profit
company will help him align the fractious constituencies that make
up the NASD by giving them a common interest in the form of a
profit motive. The deal will bring together people who today mostly
look at things separately as ``investors, vendors, issuers and
market makers big and small,'' he said. ``That in itself will give
a common interest.''

COMPAQ TO CUT UP TO 8,000 JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. said it will cut between 6,000 and 8,000
jobs, close more facilities and take a third-quarter charge of up
to $900 million as part of its latest restructuring campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its plans Wednesday, the Houston-based personal
computer maker declined to say how many of its 11,000 employees in
New England will lose their jobs or say which units will be
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts come on top of a layoff of 17,000 employees tied to
Compaq's $9.1 billion purchase of Digital Equipment Corp. of
Maynard, Mass. last year.
</P>
<P>
   But since then Compaq has been struggling with falling personal
computer prices and a shift to direct sales over the Internet. The
additional cuts are needed as part of an effort to reduce costs by
$2 billion a year, said Compaq's new chief executive, Michael
Capellas.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to announce more specifics by Aug. 15,
Capellas said, and to complete the bulk of the layoffs by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq had previously warned of more cuts but hadn't cited
specific numbers before Wednesday, when it reported its
second-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months ended June 30, Compaq said it lost $184
million, or 10 cents per diluted share, on revenue of $9.4 billion.
Revenue grew by 17 percent on a pro forma basis over the combined
revenues of Compaq and Digital for the same period a year ago,
Compaq said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq blamed the loss on rising expenses, and on tight profit
margins stemming from fierce competitors like Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in some of the company's service-related business lines
also grew at a ``disappointing'' rate, Capellas said.
</P>
<P>
   But overall the results met Wall Street's expectations, and
analysts seemed to approve of the plans for more cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they might have done differently,'' said
J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Daniel R. Kunstler. ``We have to
trust them for better execution than they have had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Compaq moved quickly to announce its decision, said
Wasserstein Parella analyst Stephen Dube. ``Probably the best thing
I can say about Mr. Capellas so far is that he does seem much more
a man of action than the prior characters at Compaq,'' Dube said,
referring to former Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer.
Pfeiffer was removed in April after a series of financial
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Dube said, ``I think things are going to happen
fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq employs about 70,000 people worldwide. Of the 17,000
layoffs previously announced, it has completed 15,250, Capellas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's New England work force includes about 7,000 in
Massachusetts, including many members of its services division, and
about 4,000 people in New Hampshire. In May Compaq said it would
shut a Salem, N.H., factory that once employed 900.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq announced its results after the close of trading. Prior
to that, shares rose 9/16 to close at 25 15/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

ACTIVITY DOWN AS INVESTORS AWAIT KEY ECONOMIC REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Computer-related stocks lifted the Nasdaq market to
its second straight gain Wednesday, even as a majority of other
issues sagged. Activity slackened as investors braced for key
economic reports from Washington Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is waiting for some heavy-duty data,'' said
Christine A. Callies, chief investment strategist at CS First
Boston, mainly to examine the date for any signs of inflation that
might persuade Fed policymakers to raise short-term interest rates
again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, made his
second congressional appearance in two weeks Wednesday, he provided
no fresh clues about the central bank's intentions on interest
rates, and members of Congress concentrated their questions on the
wisdom of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, market operators are now awaiting Thursday's Labor
Department's survey of employment costs and the Commerce
Department's first estimate of gross domestic product, both
covering the quarter ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is sort of slip-sliding around here'' except for a
``relief'' rally in high technology, said Robert H. Stovall,
president of Stovall/21st Advisers. After skidding four of six
sessions for a loss of 245 points, the tech-dominated Nasdaq
composite index has now posted back-to-back gains for the first
time since mid-month.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's bounce of of 26.51 points, or just under 1 percent,
was aided by a decision by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
to postpone tougher rules for writing off research-and-development
costs in acquisitions, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow Jones industrial average could not sustain its
Monday advance and finished with a loss of 6.97 points, closing at
10.972.07, after having been ahead by as many as 45.
</P>
<P>
   And the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index, while eking out a
gain of about two-tenths of 1 percent, showed little strength apart
from technology. Falling components outnumbered rising ones by 277
to 203, with 20 stocks unchanged. The index closed up 2.56 points
at 1,365.40.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates were little changed Thursday as the Treasury's
$15 billion auction of two-year notes went smoothly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stocks highly sensitive to interest rates have been prominent
among those making new 52-week lows, Stovall noted, reflecting
fears of narrowed margins and dampened business. New lows overall
swamped new highs 134-54 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange,
where 1,602 issues fell and 1,374 rose.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover eased to 690.96 million shares from 714.6 million
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the general lackluster mood did not keep speculative-minded
investors from chasing the latest Internet IPO. Drugstore.com's 5
million shares were offered at 18, began trading at 65 and changed
hands at 70 before closing at 50\ on volume of 8.86 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Intel was once again a market star, rising 2} to 70 5/16 after a
4 11/16-point surge on Tuesday as chip prices were reported to have
firmed and S G Cowen raised its rating from ``neutral'' to ``buy.''
Volume climbed to 41.7 million shares from 39 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Other big high-tech winners included Texas Instruments, up 5
7/16 to 148 9/16; Broadcom, up 11] to 128; Micron Technology, up 3~
to 61}; Microsoft, up 1 3/16 to 90; Priceline.com up 11 11/32 to
85, and Ebay and Amazon.com up 5] and 4}, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer edged up 9/16 to 25 15/16; after the close the
company, the biggest maker of personal computers reported a
second-quarter loss that was in line with analysts' forecasts and a
restructuring to cut costs that will result in the loss of 8,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Dow blue chips, Dupont gained 11/16 to 72 13/16 after
reporting earnings at the top end of expectations and IBM gained 2[
to 128]. Exxon and Mobil each rose more than a point.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, stocks were moderately higher in Tokyo, Hong Kong and
Britain, slightly higher in Germany and France and down by
four-tenths of 1 percent in Brazil. Mexico and Toronto jumped 1.43
percent and 1.26 percent, respectively.

 &HT;    Arsenal tires of prima donna striker
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ceremonial start of the English season might be tempered a
bit Saturday as Manchester United and Arsenal meet at Wembley
Stadium in the Charity Shield friendly match. The clubs who
finished just a point apart at the top of the Premier League will
put most of their best players forward a week before the official
schedule gets under way _ with two notable exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Brooding 20-year-old French striker Nicolas Anelka's summer-long
melodrama took a new twist Tuesday when Arsenal took him off the
transfer list and ordered him to report to training camp. He is
bunkered somewhere in Paris, blaming his absence on ``depression.''
While scoring 17 goals for the Gunners, Anelka complained
repeatedly about life in London, the British press and teammates
not passing the ball enough to him. His growing legion of handlers
decided to milk his unhappiness for all they could.
</P>
<P>
   United captain Roy Keane is balking at the club's $13 million
offer to extend a contract that expires after the coming season.
The Irish midfielder wants $16 million to remain with United, which
is the league, FA Cup and European champion, and is expected to
work things out in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Anelka saga, however, is setting new lows for ugliness and
greed, worse than Ronaldo's protracted move from Barcelona to Inter
Milan in 1997. After Arsenal offered Anelka to Italian Serie A
runner-up Lazio for $35 million, matching the second-largest
transfer on record, his two brother ``advisers'' demanded a weekly
wage of $96,000 for the player. That's an amount that even the
high-spending Roman club, which has forked out $160 million in the
transfer market over the last two years, had a hard time
swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   It's an astonishing demand for a player who has had just one
good professional season. Lazio, which needs scoring help after
packing Christian Vieri off to Inter for a world record $50
million, isn't giving up hope, despite Arsenal's action. ``It was
not a surprise for us,'' said Anelka's attorney, Marc Roget, who
won the Bosman case in 1995 that opened up European free-agency.
``We have no reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anelka's future ex-teammates did. ``None of us could care
less,'' midfielder Ray Parlour told The Daily Telegraph on
Wednesday. ``I've forgotten about the bloke. Whether he plays in
the first team again will be very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico slips up against Egypt
</P>
<P>
   Egypt scored twice in the final 12 minutes, including the
equalizer from Samir Ibrahim in the 85th minute, to draw 2-2 with
host Mexico on Tuesday in the Confederations Cup. Mexico is all but
assured of a spot in the second round, but the other qualifier from
Group A is up for grabs. Bolivia and Saudi Arabia tied 0-0 in the
other half of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Tabloid loses libel suit
</P>
<P>
   Britain's largest daily newspaper, Rupert Murdoch's tabloid The
Sun, was ordered on Wednesday to pay $134,900 in damages and
$793,800 in attorneys' fees to former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce
Grobbelaar. The British High Court ruled in the goalkeeper's favor
in his libel suit against the newspaper, which alleged in 1994 that
Grobbelaar was paid $75,000 to help Liverpool lose a match against
Newcastle. Grobbelaar and three other men were acquitted in London
on charges two years ago that they assisted an Asian gambling
syndicate. He was suspended for wagering on soccer matches but
denied betting against his own team. The Sun is appealing the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers seek bigger stage
</P>
<P>
   The Glasgow Rangers' dominance of the domestic scene in Scotland
figures to be secure once again this year, but they have more
continental ambitions. Rangers, who won the league, Scottish Cup
and League Cup crowns, have added depth in their bid to prosper in
Europe, where they have only one trophy _ the 1972 Cup Winners'
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been building a squad simply to play in the
Scottish Premier League,'' chairman David Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   League season begins Friday, but Rangers got their European
Champions League campaign off to a strong start Wednesday in
routing FC Haka of Finland 4-1. American midfielder Claudio Reyna,
signed late last season, started and had an assist. The draw has
been unkind to Rangers, however, with a second-round series against
UEFA Cup champions Parma on tap if they advance.
</P>
<P>
   MLS: Revs get Graziani
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadorian striker Ariel Graziani, a prime MLS target all year,
has been allocated to the New England Revolution, which certainly
isn't opposed to having him. It's just that the Revs could use a
central defender more. Player-coach Walter Zenga had been pursuing
Ghanaian defender Joseph Addo, but Graziani took up the remaining
foreign-player slot in MLS. . . . Commissioner Doug Logan will meet
with German sweeper Lothar Matthaus during the Confederations Cup
this week to consider his desire to play in the league. Matthaus,
38, has expressed an interest in leaving Bayern Munich to play for
the woeful MetroStars next season. The U.S. team is looking for its
second win of the year over Germany in Guadalajara on Friday. . . .
The MetroStars might be bad _ 5-13, second-worst record in the
league _ but they're never boring. Newly signed Serbian forward
Sasha Curcic arrived at Giants Stadium for his first game Saturday
with his head shaved and declared, ``I am your Dennis Rodman.'' No
signs of tattoos or a wedding dress, however. . . . Raul Diaz Arce,
second in career goals and points in Major League Soccer, suited up
for his fourth team in the league last weekend after being traded
from San Jose to Tampa Bay.

ABC NEWS WANTS TO BE THE PLACE TO BE FOR NEW YEAR'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If Peter Jennings had any dreams of ringing
in the year 2000 at some exotic hideaway, far from all the
carousing and the Y2K frenzy, he's not saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent some time convincing my wife that Times Square is
the place to be for New Year's Eve 2000,'' Jennings said Wednesday
by satellite hookup from New York. It's not because he doesn't like
to travel. It's because he has to work Dec. 31, and he'll be
working from ABC's new studio now under construction at 1500
Broadway near Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings will anchor ``ABC 2000,'' a 22-hour overview of New
Year's celebrations and millennium-related events around the world.
Starting at 3 a.m. Pacific time on Friday, Dec. 31, and continuing
until 1 a.m. New Year's Day, the live broadcast shapes up as the
most ambitious cooperative venture of its kind. With the assistance
of broadcast partners in 60 countries, ABC says it plans to be the
place to be for news of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   To those who would argue that the new millennium doesn't begin
until Jan. 1, 2001, Jennings says: ``As this has been the century
of the common man, I think we have all just increasingly begun to
defer to the common man's instinct that the turnover date is
2000.'' Though he intellectually accepts the argument that the
current millennium has a year to go, he said the momentum in favor
of celebrating the new millennium prematurely is unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess,'' Jennings said, ``that that train is not one which
I would like to stand in front of.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer, who have been ``subbing'' as
co-anchors of ``Good Morning America'' while ABC tries to figure
out if there's a potential morning team out there that has similar
star power and can keep ``GMA'' out of the ratings Dumpster, are
signed to their indefinite assignment at least through next May.
</P>
<P>
   But Gibson adds: ``There's this funny situation where David
Westin calls us in, and he has extraordinary persuasive powers, and
he says, `Well, would you mind just extending for ...?' And we say,
`OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Westin, the president of ABC News, is completely vague
about how long Gibson and Sawyer will stay at ``GMA.'' ``The
long-term plan is to have the right people on the program in all
the positions,'' he said Wednesday, ``and Diane and Charles have
been gracious enough to give us as much time as we need to identify
the right people and groom them and introduce them to the audience.
... We'll know when we have it right, (but) we're not prepared to
make that transition now and I don't have a certain date in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   _ We all know Oscar winner Kathy Bates can act. But can she
sing? Producer Craig Zadan was wondering the same thing when
Broadway veteran Victor Garber suggested Bates for the role of the
heartless Miss Hannigan in a new ``Wonderful World of Disney''
production of ``Annie,'' due on ABC next season.
</P>
<P>
   Garber, who plays Daddy Warbucks in the film, appeared with
Bates in the film ``Titanic'' and knew she was ``dying to do a
musical,'' as Zadan tells it. ``The next thing we knew we had a
meeting,'' Zadan said, ``and wait unil you hear her sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who until now has confined her vocal performances to
shower stalls and automobiles, taught herself to play the guitar
and sing when she moved to New York in 1970. She actually sold a
song to Milos Forman for his film, ``Taking Off,'' but because she
couldn't read music and lacked formal voice training, she felt she
didn't belong in the musical milieu.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I put all my eggs in one basket and went into the acting
aspect of it,'' she said. ``But I was a bit frustrated all these
years and I kept thinking, `Oh, you know, one of these days I'd
really do it.'''

SENATE KILLS DEMOCRAT EFFORT TO LIMIT TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A major tax cut could threaten the nation's
economic boom, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
Wednesday as the Senate opened a high-stakes showdown over the
largest proposed tax break in US history.
</P>
<P>
   With Republican leaders pushing $792 billion in tax cuts and
President Clinton supporting as much as $300 billion in breaks,
Greenspan cautioned against rushing to give away a projected budget
surplus the government has yet to reap.
</P>
<P>
   Unswayed, the Republican-controlled Senate Thursday night killed
a Democratic plan to cut taxes by $290 billion over 10 years,
keeping alive the GOP's $792 billion package for a final vote by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are framing the tax struggle as a defining event in
their campaigns for control of the White House and Congress in next
year's election. President Clinton has vowed to veto any tax cut
larger that $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut
immediately, largely because of the fact that it is apparent that
the surpluses are doing a great deal of positive good to the
economy,'' Greenspan testified before the Senate Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan warned that projections of a $3 trillion federal
surplus over the next decade could swiftly diminish. ``They could
just as rapidly go in the other direction,'' Greenspan said, adding
that he saw ``no problem'' in delaying a major tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's political leaders showed little appetite for
delay, as they sharpened the rhetoric in their competing quests to
scale back federal taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In signs of the increasing rancor, the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, called Clinton ``totally irresponsible'' in his
criticism of the $792 billion package, and the president's allies
continued to hammer the GOP measure as a recipe for economic
disaster. ``It's radical, it's risky, it's reckless,'' said Senator
Kent Conrad, a South Dakota Democrat. ``And it ought to be
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the House passed a separate version of the $792
billion tax-cut plan, the Senate voted, 60-39, to kill the $290
Democratic alternative. Six Democrats, most of whom support a
bipartisan plan for $500 billion in tax breaks, broke ranks and
joined the unified Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   The only New England Democrat to vote against the measure was
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who called for
postponing any tax cut because of the precariousness of the surplus
projections. ``We are well positioned for economic security,''
Lieberman said. ``And before the ink is barely dry on the
projections, I am afraid, we are about to jeopardize it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Democrats posted a rare victory, as the Senate voted,
51-48, to limit the proposed $792 billion tax cut to 10 years.
Democrats argued that the GOP plan would create a huge national
deficit in the second decade of the tax break.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders wanted to make the tax breaks permanent. They
needed 60 votes to prevail on the procedural issue but mustered
only 51 votes. They were blocked by all 45 Democrats and three GOP
defectors, including the two Maine senators, Olympia J. Snowe and
Susan M. Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The vote means that current tax laws would become effective
again in 2009 if the $792 billion package becomes law this year.
</P>
<P>
   The victory for Senate Democrats provided minor consolation
after their alternative tax-cut plan was soundly rejected. The
Senate Democratic leader, Thomas A. Daschle, said the plan called
for ``the kind of targeted, controlled and prudent'' changes that
would benefit taxpayers and not threaten the country's vibrant
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democratic alternative, tax burdens would have been
eased by increasing the standard deduction for individuals to
$5,600 from $4,300, and for married couples to $11,550 from $7,200.
The measure also would have reduced the ``marriage tax'' penalty
and expanded credits for education, health care and child care.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans scoffed at the size of the proposed
package. ``It's too puny to do the economic good that ought to be
done,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a senior
Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Still pending are several major Demcoratic amendments, including
a plan by Senator John F. Kerry to provide $20 billion in Medicare
funds to ease the crunch caused by federal cutbacks at teaching
hospitals, home health care agencies and nursing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would allow Congress to freeze reductions in federal
payments to teaching hospitals for graduate medical education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With just a limited adjustment in the tax cut, Congress can
ensure that the doors of our nation's hospitals, teaching
hospitals, home health care agencies, skilled nursing facilities
and rural health care providers remain open,'' Kerry said in a
letter to his Senate colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate move, Semator Edward M. Kennedy will try to reduce
an unspecified amount of the proposed tax cuts to help fund a
prescription-drug benefit for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry and Kennedy are trying to amend the Republican measure,
even though they are expected to join nearly all 45 Democrats in
opposing the $792 billion plan. If the amendments are approved,
they could become part of a final package that is negotiated
between House and Senate leaders and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vowed to veto any tax cut greater than $300 billion,
and Daschle insisted Wednesday that Democrats control enough votes
to sustain a veto. Republicans outnumber Democrats, 55-45, in the
Senate, but 67 votes are need to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said backers of the bipartisan plan, the final
package could look more like their $500 billion initiative than the
Republican or Democratic versions. The bipartisan plan's sponsors
include Snowe, Collins and the other GOP moderates from New
England: Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, and James M.
Jeffords of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe said the compromise plan would guard against a downturn in
the economy. ``We are erring on the side of caution,'' she said.
``We are striking the middle ground between what is fiscally
responsible and politically viable.''

   WASHINGTON _ A new survey shows widespread discontent among
doctors and nurses about the quality of health care under managed
care plans. Many doctors said some of their patients had been
denied coverage for a health service they needed, from a
prescription drugto a hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was released in the midst of a struggle over
patients' rights legislation on Capitol Hill, and was immediately
criticized by spokesmen for health maintenance organizations and
the insurance industry as flawed and exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
nonprofit health research group, was just as quickly praised by the
American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Altman, the president of Kaiser, acknowledged that doctors
are not always right when they prescribe a test, a drug or a
treatment, and that therefore not every denial of coverage by a
health plan is a bad thing. But he argued, ``I don't know that
anyone would strongly defend this level of conflict as an efficient
way to run a health system.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignani, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, which represents health maintenance organizations and other
managed care organizations, said the Kaiser study was
``inconsistent with existing research which has provided a very
different assessment of these issues.'' Previous studies have shown
that health plans approve coverage for the vast majority of
services recommended by doctors, she said, adding that the Kaiser
study failed to focus on how often doctors recommend inappropriate
care.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser study was conducted with the Harvard School of Public
Health and was administered by mail among a random sample of 1,053
physicians and 768 nurses, between Feb. 11 and June 5. The findings
for the doctors have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3
percentage points; for nurses, of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Because relative- ly few Medicare beneficiaries are in managed
care plans, the survey asked doctors and nurses only about their
experiences with patients un- der 65.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent of doctors said insurance plans denied
coverage for a prescription drug for one of their patients on a
weekly or monthly basis. Thirty-one percent said they experienced
denials of a hospital stay on a weekly or monthly basis, and 42
percent said they had experienced denials of diagnostic tests or
procedures that often. (Another 27 percent said they had
experienced denials for diagnostic tests every six months to a
year.)
</P>
<P>
   Between a third and two-thirds of the doctors said their most
recent denial had resulted in a serious decline in the patient's
health status, depending on the type of service denied.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of the nurses surveyed said they saw patients'
health suffer because of decisions made by health plans. Thirty
percent of the nurses _ and 26 percent of the doctors _ said they
sometimes exaggerated the severity of a patient's condition to get
care they thought was necessary. And a majority of doctors said
that they or someone in their office would periodically try to
intervene with a health plan on their patients' behalf, and were
often successful.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and nurses did have some good things to say about
managed care, the HMOs and other health networks that now deliver
care to most Americans. Forty-five percent of the doctors and 42
percent of the nurses said managed care increased the likelihood
that patients will get preventive services.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of primary care physicians felt that way. And 68
percent of the doctors and 51 percent of the nurses said that
managed care had increased the use of guidelines and disease
management protocols, more modern and standardized ways of treating
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, a strikingly negative view emerges of managed
care. Ninety-five percent of the doctors said it had increased the
amount of administrative paperwork for providers and patients.
Seventy-two percent said it had decreased the quality of health
care for people who are sick, and 77 percent said it had decreased
the ability of patients to get the tests and treatments they
needed. Eighty-six percent said it had decreased the ability of
patients to see medical specialists, and 83 percent said it had
decreased the amount of time doctors spend with their patients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, these concerns affect the quality of the care
patients receive,'' said Dr. J. Edward Hill, a trustee of the
American Medical Association, who was on a panel convened by Kaiser
Wednesday to discuss the survey. ``Doctors know it, nurses know it,
and most importantly, patients know it. Not surprisingly, the only
sector of the health care industry that refuses to acknowledge this
fact is the one that has the most to gain from the status quo _ the
insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In another survey released Wednesday, the National Committee on
Quality Assurance, a nonprofit organization focused on measuring
the quality of managed care organizations, evaluated data
voluntarily submitted from 410 health plans that cover 70 million
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 57 percent of people rated their health
plans an 8, 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale, and that there was a
strong connection between accountability, clinical performance and
customer satisfaction. Three-fourths of consumers in the survey
said that getting needed care was not a problem, while 17.9 percent
said it was a small problem and 8.6 percent said it was a big
problem. New England health plans were out in front on a variety of
measures, like smoking cessation efforts and cervical cancer
screening.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
WICHITA FALLS _ Emmitt Smith showed up at Cowboys camp Wednesday as
the NFL's active career rushing leader thanks to Barry Sanders'
surprise retirement earlier that morning.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smith, who arrived here one day before the mandatory reporting
date for veterans, was stunned upon hearing the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're joking,'' Smith said. ``That's got to be a joke. I
don't buy it just yet, because the man has many, many, many years
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sympathize with the man's situation over there. He's
been everything Detroit wants, but has Detroit been everything he's
needed? Probably not. So frustration and a lot of disappointment
are on his side.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders amassed 15,269 career rushing yards in 10 seasons with
the Lions, just 1,457 shy of Walter Payton's 13-year record of
16,726. Considering his average per season topped 1,500 yards,
Sanders might well have reached the mark this year, making the
retirement that much more shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, dealing with coming back into training camp, dealing
with the organization maybe not putting in place what they need to
put in place in order for them to have a successful team, he's
probably had enough,'' Smith said. ``It's been 10 years for him.
They had 10 years to do what they committed to doing _ and that's
putting together a team that allowed them to win _ and they've
failed to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot put myself in his position. I've been fortunate
enough and blessed by God to be put in an organization that's been
committed to winning and has won and has brought in some players to
keep it going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Dickerson (13,259) and Tony Dorsett (12,739) stand between
Sanders and Smith, who is in fifth place on the all-time list with
12,566 yards over nine seasons. And it will now be Smith who has
the most immediate chance to dethrone Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has topped the 1,000-yard mark in every year but his
rookie season and, despite turning 30 this year, says retirement is
nowhere in the picture right now. He needs 4,161 yards to become
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm far from retirement,'' Smith said. ``I think last year was
the first year I've completed a complete season feeling healthy. I
look forward to what we have this year.''
</P>
<P>
   With Sanders out of the picture, all eyes will be on Smith, but
that's not the way the Cowboys star wants to etch his name in the
record books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a selfish person would look at it that way,'' says Smith,
whose words reflect his disbelief at Sanders' retirement. ``I want
to see it happen (Sanders breaking the record). He's got an
excellent opportunity. He could do it this year. It would be
exciting to watch and be part of history, knowing that I was in the
same time frame, being able to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And hopefully, someday, my time would come. That's all I want,
my chance to come, whether it be Walter, or whether it be Barry. I
just want my chance to come someday.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at 31, Sanders likely could have played for several
more seasons and put the record out of Smith's reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barry would have been the first back to actually break
the 20,000 barrier,'' Smith said. ``I actually believe that. He had
many, many years in front of him. This is a very unfortunate
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is only temporary. Maybe he'll reconsider and come
back. Maybe they might trade him away. Who knows? It's sad for the
NFL, because they're losing one of the best backs they've ever had
in the game _ and at a young age. He's walking away like Jim Brown
(No. 6 on the all-time list) walked away (after nine seasons).''
</P>
<P>
   Considering Sanders had four years left on a six-year, $36
million contract, Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin said his
retirement proves not all players are greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should tell a lot of people that it's not just about
money,'' Irvin said. ``You underestimate the power of just winning.
Barry has great things in front of him. Probably, if he just plays
and is 75 percent of the man he was in the past, there are so many
things he can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's saying that even if he's playing at 100 percent, and
Lord knows that's been great, it's not going to help that team win.
The most important thing is winning. That tells you the kind of
person he is. He's got money on the table, and he says it's not
about it. It's about winning. That's why you play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmitt has three Super Bowl rings. That's the key. I can
guarantee you this: Barry would switch with Emmitt any day of the
week. That's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Sanders return if he could play elsewhere? Smith said he
would love to see the league office step in and force Detroit to
make a trade if it would bring Sanders back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league should step in, because you're losing
basically the cornerstone of the National Football League,'' Smith
said. ``There have been only four guys to rush for over 2,000
yards. He's one of those guys. He's been a stand-up individual for
the National Football League for 10 years. He's been committed and
helped the National Football League for 10 years, been a bright
spot in that organization for 10 years. The man deserves to be on a
winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not management. I can't force that decision. I can't
make that move. If he decides to leave the game, it's his choice.
The only thing I can say is I wish he wouldn't at the present
moment, because I would love to see him break the record. I would
love to see that happen. And I wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with Smith, especially if a trade might mean
seeing Sanders with a division rival such as Washington, which made
offseason inquiries about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but if the NFL steps in to try to help Barry
no,'' Irvin said. ``Don't send him to the East. I love Barry, but
he either plays in Detroit, or don't play. Don't let him come to
Washington. Washington has all those draft picks that might get
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to run over to Jerry's (Jones) office today to throw
a red flag on this. Don't bring him to the East. There are a lot of
great guys who haven't had a chance to win a championship. I wish
he had, and I hope he does, but it has to be in Detroit. Don't let
him come to the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, all his friends can do is support Sanders _ or maybe
beg a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on back,'' Smith pleaded. ``Come on back. Don't let me
end up being the Lone Ranger.''

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Aug. 1,
1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VENICE-BIENNALE (Venice, Italy) _ To look at new art is to
expect to feel something or be told something or be tweaked or
entertained in ways that have nothing necessarily to do with
tangible objects. Art less and less is judged by the old priorities
of painting, sculpture and drawing. It is context that increasingly
determines the shape of the art we see. Exhibit No. 1: the 48th
Venice Biennale. It's commonly being said about the show that video
art dominates, which is true, but only up to a point. By Michael
Kimmelman. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHEREAU-FILMS (Undated) _ Part enfant terrible and part national
treasure, Patrice Chereau has built a formidable reputation in
France, with three decades of groundbreaking work in theater, opera
and, increasingly, film. His latest movie, ``Those Who Love Me Can
Take the Train,'' had its premiere at the Cannes International Film
Festival last year. By Leslie Camhi. (Moved). Photo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ILLUMINATA-FILM (New York) _ It's twilight _ the haunting hour
that mingles longing and regret, promise and speculation _ and the
world's youngest method actor is brooding in his Brooklyn bedroom.
``Usually, I (italics)like(end italics) challenging roles,'' says
Amedeo Turturro with the magnificent assurance of an 8-year-old.
``But that role was so challenging, they practically had to force
me to do it.'' The ``they'' he's referring to are his parents, the
actors John Turturro and Katherine Borowitz. The ``it'' is
``Illuminata,'' an engagingly heartfelt new film in which all three
appear. ``Illuminata,'' which opens on Friday, is about a stock
company of 19th- century actors, and the Turturro family has pretty
much become a stock company, too. Husband and wife have performed
together in three plays and three movies, two of which Amedeo
cameoed in. By Franz Lidz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STARR-TAPE-THEATER (Undated) _ ``Starr's Last Tape,'' a one-man
play in which a character named Starr, dressed in a prison jump
suit and surrounded by tapes abnd tape recorders, sings hymns,
tunes in to phone taps and dictates his memoirs. The play will have
its world premiere in Stockbridge, Mass., at the Berkshire Theater
Festival's second stage, the Unicorn, from Aug. 24 through 28.
Brian Reddy, who played Stephen Douglas in the 1993 Lincoln Center
Theater revival of ``Abe Lincoln in Illinois,'' will star as
Kenneth N. Starr, directed by Eric Hill. By Sylviane Gold.
(Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CARNIVAL-CENTURY-FEST (New York) _ To many New Yorkers, Lincoln
Center Out &UR; - &LR; of &UR; - &LR; Doors has always been there _ a three-week
extravaganza every August that offers a diverse fare of free dance,
music and theater. The forthcoming series, the ``Carnival of the
Century,'' starting Friday, is solidly within that tradition. It
includes the jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, a Greek blues singer, Les
Ballets Trokadero de Monte Carlo, music of the Jewish Diaspora, a
Peruvian dance company and the Colorado String Quartet, plus
entertainment designed just for children. By Valerie Gladstone.
(Moved). Photo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PEONY-PAVILION-MUSIC (New York) _ It's no use either admiring or
picking apart the Lincoln Center Festival '99. Management had
co-designers imposed on it, Shanghai bureaucracy and Lady Luck
among them. The last-minute cancellation of ``The Peony Pavilion''
in 1998 left a hole in the center of the event a year ago. The
resuscitation of this 19-hour Ming Dynasty classic in 1999 was
welcomed by nearly everyone, but it certainly altered any theme
Lincoln Center might originally have had in mind. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRITTEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ As a composer, Benjamin Britten is not
without detractors among critics and concertgoers. But by any
reasonable measure he is a major figure, a 20th-century master
whose arresting operas, brilliant symphonic works, inventive
chamber music and literate songs hold deserved places in the
repertory. BBC Music has issued five remastered CDs, with more to
come, in a series called ``Britten the Performer.'' Most document
live performances, though a few are taken from studio recordings.
The series includes fascinating performances of Mozart, Tchaikovsky
and Mahler. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PROPAGANDA-PHOTOGS (Washington) _ The word propaganda originally
meant spreading the religious faith; it acquired a generally
pejorative sense only in World War I, when governments took strict
control of war information that could be used in the mass media.
Long before, every medium that could spread ideologies or enhance
renown and power had been called upon to do so. Popes and kings and
dictators commissioned architecture, sculpture and painting,
enlisted playwrights and speakers, and hired designers to shape the
ruler's image and fashion the servants' livery as well as the
military's uniforms. When photography came along, it, too, was soon
pressed into service. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MODERN-BOOKS-COLLECTING (Undated) _ Since the early '90s, prices
for first editions of modern literary works have hit the
stratosphere: $35,000 for a signed copy of Jack Kerouac's ``On the
Road''; $250,000 for a copy of ``Ulysses'' signed by James Joyce to
Ezra Pound, and $15,000 for Harper Lee's ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
The gold rush in such literary ``high points'' _ the industry term
for well known titles by name authors _ has also fostered
speculation in recently published books _ first editions printed
within the last five years that are still in pristine condition and
preferably signed by the author. By Christa Worthington. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-ONCE-AGAIN (Undated) _ A look at ABC's forthcoming drama
series ``Once and Again,'' which will be introduced for seven
weeks, starting Tuesday, Sept. 21, at 10 p.m. By Bernard Weinraub.

 &HT;    Giuliani courts Alabama cash
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM _ It was nice while it lasted.
</P>
<P>
   That's clearly what New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was
thinking Wednesday afternoon soon after beginning a press
conference smack in the middle of a busy day of fund-raising all
over Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the international press corps and the joviality that
had greeted him Tuesday in Little Rock, onetime home of first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Gone, too, was Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee
to toss around funny gifts and most of the more humorous barbs at
the expense of Clinton, Giuliani's likely Democratic foe in the
2000 Senate race in New York.
</P>
<P>
   One day later, nobody was having quite as much fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't (ITAL) imagine (END ITAL) we're spending so much time
on this,'' Giuliani said exasperatedly at the end of an
increasingly cantankerous exchange with several New York reporters
about his seemingly spur-of-the-moment decision Tuesday morning to
order the Arkansas state flag flown above City Hall in Manhattan.
The Democratic speaker of New York's City Council didn't like that
decision, and the much smaller press contingent that trailed
Giuliani in Alabama made sure he knew about it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they made sure he knew the one-word description a White
House official used to characterize Giuliani's two-day southern
fund-raising swing: ``Goofy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine why the White House would be interested in
that,'' Giuliani said, displaying only a flicker of the smile that
had flashed so broadly for much of the day in Arkansas. ``I don't
think I'll comment on that except to raise the question of what's
the White House doing commenting on this unless they're running
somebody's campaign from the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what else needed to be said?
</P>
<P>
   The New York race, should Giuliani and Clinton both officially
enter it, is serious business. Doubtless that is why the mayor of
New York sped from Little Rock to New Orleans on Tuesday night for
a fund-raiser. After dinner and a stroll in the French Quarter,
Giuliani decamped to Huntsville, where a morning visit to the
Marshall Space Flight Center was about the only break in a day
packed with meetings and three separate $1,000-per-person
fund-raisers in Huntsville, Tuscaloosa and Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum predicted the two-day trip
would raise between $150,000 and $175,000, all of which will come
in handy if, as is widely predicted, New York Rep. Rick Lazio
decides to challenge Giuliani in a Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a Clinton-Giuliani race everyone seems to want in
Alabama. The Alabama fund-raisers all were arranged by Tuscaloosa
real estate developer Stan Pate, who says it is Giuliani's ideas,
not his opponent, that most interest him.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to defeat Team Clinton apparently would just be a bonus.
``I do not admire the first lady or the first family,'' Pate said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Big Sky Bread Co. in nearby Mountain Brook, meanwhile,
everybody seemed to have something to say about New York's 2000
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is making this into a national election,'' said
Birmingham schoolteacher Helen Milteer, 30. ``This could only
happen in New York, or California.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone in the place seemed to prefer Giuliani _ ``If
that's what he's coming for, money, more power to him,'' said Joyce
Wohn.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did have at least one supporter. ``I want Hillary to
come down here, too, because she's kind of a celebrity,'' said Big
Sky's owner, Jeff Pierce. ``I mean, this is fun, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Just as long as he didn't say goofy.

   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ The caramel lollipops at registration; the
black thong bikini that Marilyn Wann, a proud 270 pounds, wore at
the pool party; the very pool party itself, for people who are
usually pool pariahs: All these were political statements of
defiance here at the convention of the National Association to
Advance Fat Acceptance, as political as the T-shirts reading,
``Fat! So?''

   Most of the year the association lobbies on behalf of fat people
(fat is the preferred adjective, members said, a simple description
they want to reclaim; ``overweight,'' and especially ``morbidly
obese,'' are despised.) With about 4,000 members, the association
helps fat people cope in a society that hates their girth; it
fights the diet industry, pointing out its overwhelming long-term
failure rate, and combats discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But once a year, it takes the added step of bringing together
hundreds of members _ nearly 500 this year _ to create a place
where ``people of size'' are just people, where everyone has a
story of an airplane-seat nightmare or gibes in a job interview,
and where no one suggests a new diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular one week a year when, in one particular hotel,
everyone who's larger than average looks normal, is like a
Brigadoon,'' Ms. Wann, a writer from San Francisco, said, referring
to the mythical village in the Lerner and Loewe musical, remote
from reality. ``It's odd to be in a place where you look like
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd, and for many, deeply affecting and energizing. In an
orientation session for first-time convention-goers, several spoke
about ``coming out of the closet'' as fat people, strange as that
may seem when their size has always been visible to everybody. What
they meant, they said, was the arrival at a moment when they simply
accepted their size and the likelihood that it would never change,
and wanted others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, after being tormented about being fat from the time I
was a baby, I've decided I'm going to embrace it,'' said Barbara
Lehmann, a social worker from Orono, Maine, who estimated that she
had gained and lost thousands of pounds in her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around the circle of more than 20 members, mainly women,
she commented, in a sort of wonderment, ``This is the first time
I've been in a room where I'm not the fattest person or close to
it, and it's _ it's _ what am I trying to say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberating?'' suggested Frances White, the group leader.
</P>
<P>
   The association has been pursuing such fat liberation _
officially, it is known as the ``size acceptance movement'' _ for
30 years now, with mixed success. Ask Bettye Travis, the group's
president, about the current climate, and there is good
fat-acceptance news and bad: the popularity of Camryn Manheim, the
television actress, is good; the portrayal of a gluttonous,
disgusting character in the latest Austen Powers film is bad.
</P>
<P>
   (Others say it still rankles that Oprah Winfrey, with all her
accomplishments, has described losing weight as her greatest
achievement.)
</P>
<P>
   More people are getting skeptical about diets, Ms. Travis said,
but new diet drugs with dangerous side effects keep sweeping the
country, and the medical establishment sometimes seems to be
sending the message that ``it's better to die than be fat.''
</P>
<P>
   The association's policy is to take the emphasis off dieting,
which often does more harm than good, and put it on health,
encouraging people to eat well, exercise and take care of
themselves, and let their bodies settle into their natural weight _
and then to work on getting comfortable as a person who takes up
substantial space.
</P>
<P>
   A strong current of pain ran through the convention _ the
accumulated wounds of rejection and ostracism, mean jokes, cruel
remarks that accrue to members of what Ms. Travis called ``one of
the last marginal groups that are still targeted, that it's still
`OK' to make fun of.'' There were stories about chairs that broke,
about rude doctors, about ugly plus-sized clothes and the
difficulties of buying a car with enough room or fitting into a
hospital wheelchair, about people who assumed that fat meant ugly
and lazy and dumb.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a strong current of humor and defiance, a
celebration of snappy comebacks. Recently, in San Francisco, Ms.
Travis said, a health club ran a billboard advertisement showing an
alien from space and saying, ``When they come, they will eat the
fat ones first.'' So some of the association's members did aerobics
in front of the fitness club in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The association is planning a similar rally outside the Fanueil
Hall Marketplace in Boston this Saturday, titled ``Every Body-Good
Body.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the association staged a ``million pound march'' in
Santa Monica, Calif. In the San Francisco area, a fat women's
swimming group calls itself ``Making Waves.''
</P>
<P>
   The fat-acceptance cause has made some political progress.
Although Michigan is the only state that includes a ban on size
discrimination in its civil rights law, passed in the 1970s, Santa
Monica has passed a similar city law, and one is pending in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, such a law has been proposed twice before but
has never made it to the floor of the Legislature. Another effort
is under way now, and convention organizers said Wednesday that the
state's governor, Paul Cellucci, had sent over a proclamation
declaring that this would be ``Size Acceptance Week'' in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, said state Rep. Byron Rushing, who has sponsored
the size-discrimination bills, legislators have always sent them on
for further study. ``What they are studying,'' Rushing said, ``is
whether their constituents will elect them again if they vote for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jody Abrams, an association member who testified in favor of
Rushing's bill, said that legislators, like others who still
believe in dieting, ``haven't accepted that there are just going to
be fat people in the world. That's a hard thing to come up
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Association members said they pin many of their hopes on
affecting the attitudes toward fat among young people, and are
setting up a special fat speakers' bureau to send members around to
talk at schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said Ms. Wann, who has done such school speaking and
written a book called ``Fat! So?'' (Ten Speed Press, 1998), ``the
thing we have to do is, like drag queens, make it funky to be a
rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' she said, ``but Madonna has nothing on me as a
rebel. Madonna in a thong, me in a thong _ which one is more
challenging to the status quo?''

 &HT;    Walking 1,000 miles in mental health advocate's shoes
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost every day for the past three months, someone has stopped
Stuart Perry on the road, wanting to talk about depression.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, when he left his hometown of Americus, Ga., Perry has
walked on back roads all the way to Chicago _ 1,000 miles _ talking
about depression to anyone who would listen.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, 40, who has recovered from a major depression, began his
trek to educate people about the devastating illness and to give
hope about treatment. Step by step, his ``Journey for Life'' has
pounded away at the stigma that surrounds mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   And today, Perry will deliver thousands of petitions collected
along the journey to the American Medical Association headquarters
in Chicago, urging the nation's doctors to screen their patients
routinely for depression, which strikes an estimated 18 million
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum has grown along the route. Perry has spoken in
</P>
<P>
   his down-to-earth manner to churches, rallies and rotary clubs.
He has done interviews with more than 75 newspapers, TV and radio
stations. He has appeared on call-in shows, was honored at
Louisville, Ky.'s Churchill Downs racetrack and met the inventor of
Prozac, the anti-depressant that Perry credits with saving his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Did he have doubts about covering 1,000 miles ? ``I knew I'd
make it,'' Perry said. ``If you've been clinically depressed, this
is a breeze.''
</P>
<P>
   It has meant covering 15 to 25 miles a day, seven days a week,
with only two days off, when he rested in bed. ``I didn't miss a
mile,'' Perry said. He adds, laughing: ``I have a heck of a tan.''
</P>
<P>
   He's working on his fifth pair of sneakers. He has survived a
close call with a Tennessee rattlesnake (``It scared me to
death''), an infected toe and a car of kids throwing bottles at
him, trying to run him down (``I jumped into a ditch''). Over the
last few days, as he was winding up the journey, the Midwestern
heat index hit triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   Friends accompanying Perry have kept his spirits high. Donations
have ranged from two Fleetwood motor coaches, grants from drug
manufacturers, to home-cooked meals along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly changed lives here,'' said Jill Kartisek of the
Mental Health Association of Northern Kentucky. Through his
interviews, she says, Perry reached an unusually high number of
males, who showed up at depression screenings, or sought
information about depression.
</P>
<P>
   One couple heard him on a talk show, then followed him on the
road, helping him plant a tree in Kokomo, Ind. ``They lost their
son to suicide,'' says Perry, whose father killed himself 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perry also visited a state hospital for the mentally ill in
Kentucky. ``He gave hope to those people _ that you can come out on
the other side with a life that has meaning and productivity,''
said Margaret Pennington, commissioner of Kentucky's department of
mental health and mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with the AMA, Perry will return to his family and
Americus, where he plans to help run a counseling center. He's
thinking about another walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it,'' he said. ``I don't know where I'm going,
but I'm going somewhere.''

FRESHMAN MUST WAIT TO ATTEND USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sagan Atuatasi, an incoming freshman defensive
tackle, will not attend USC this season because he did not meet the
university's admission requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Atuatasi, who played at Los Alamitos High, met the minimum
academic standards of the NCAA Clearinghouse and scored a 980 on
the Scholastic Assessment Test but did not meet the university's
requirements based on his grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to attend Cypress College on a part-time basis this
year, and enroll at USC in the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Atuatasi is no longer required to attend USC, because his
national letter-of-intent has been voided. But his father, Matthew,
said his son still intends to play for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll enroll at USC next year,'' Matthew Atuatasi said.
``There were never any other schools he considered besides USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to go to USC right away, but now that they made
this decision, it's best in the long run. He'll get a chance to
bring up his study habits and be a student.''
</P>
<P>
   Atuatasi (6-foot-3, 295 pounds) was considered one of the top
defensive linemen in the West. He had 55 solo tackles and eight
sacks at Los Alamitos last season.
</P>
<P>
   Atuatasi, 17, intended to redshirt his freshman season,
according to his father. Matthew Atuatasi said his son will still
redshirt during the 2000 season.

ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DEFEND DECISION TO SPEED UP CLARK'S
RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president's top security adviser on Wednesday
defended the decision to speed up the retirement of the NATO
supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, by a few months to make way
for his intended replacement, insisting it did not signal any
displeasure with the general's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Clark is a superb commander,'' said Sandy Berger, the
national security adviser to the president. ``The president has the
highest degree of confidence in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Secretary of Defense William Cohen chose Gen.
Joseph Ralston, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as
his candidate to succeed Clark as the next head of U.S. forces in
Europe and NATO commander.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said on Wednesday that moving Ralston
to the prestigious NATO post was the Pentagon's primary motive.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston is required by law to leave his current post next
February, because he will have served the maximum four years. That
timetable in turn led to the decision to ask Clark to vacate his
post a few months early. He had been scheduled to retire next
summer when his extended term expired.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Clark was taken aback by the suddenness of
the decision to have him retire in April or May, a message relayed
to him by telephone on Tuesday while he was traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``His assumption was that he would remain as long as he was
doing a good job,'' said a NATO official who asked not to be
identified. ``This came sooner than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Several officials felt compelled to dismiss any notion that
Clark's many disagreements with the Pentagon and other NATO member
nations during the Kosovo air war may have contributed to this
decision. Clark urged a more aggressive bombing campaign and asked
the Pentagon for speedier deployment of equipment and troops.
</P>
<P>
   His insistence that NATO prepare for the possibility of a ground
war was at odds with the administration, which did not want to
pursue a ground invasion that would be publicly unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Officials went to great lengths on Wednesday to downplay that
friction, and turn the spotlight on the promotion of Ralston.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright joined on
Wednesday in praising Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done an outstanding job in serving this capacity as
commander of the European forces and supreme allied commander,``
Cohen said at a news conference in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, met with senior military commanders, including Clark, in
Tampa, Fla., but nothing was said to Clark about his impending
early retirement, several officials at the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, when Shelton telephoned Clark who was on an official
visit to Lithuania, to tell him the news, Clark was upset that he
had not been told in Florida, according to a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Shelton said the chairman had telephoned Clark
as soon as the final decision was made over the weekend and Ralston
had agreed to become a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said on Wednesday that he considered the action part of a
routine change of command. ``When a soldier's journey is over, it's
over,'' he said in Vilnius, Lithuania, according to the Baltic News
Service.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill, reaction to Clark's early
retirement was muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is much ado about very little here,'' said Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who opposed the air war, but is
close to Clark. ``I don't think this is in any way a slap at
General Clark. It's not unusual to make a two- or three-month
adjustment in someone's tour to accommodate another officer.''  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawmakers and officers praised Ralston, 55. ``Joe Ralston will
be very good,'' said Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., who is on the
House Armed Services Committee.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A highly decorated former combat pilot in Vietnam and an
administrator known for his skills at consensus building, Ralston
withdrew from consideration for chairman of the Joint Chiefs two
years ago after it was disclosed that he had had an affair in the
1980s while separated from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to retire to Anchorage next year. But during his
last two years as the vice chairman, his job performance helped
erase military and administration concerns that he could not
surmount the adultery scandal.

NEW CANCER CELL RESEARCH COULD LEAD TO SPECIFIC TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For the first time, scientists say they have created
human cancer cells in a laboratory dish by disabling the few
essential ``gatekeepers'' that keep normal cells from turning into
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know what a bare-bones cancer cell could look like''
and may be able to use that knowledge to design a more effective
therapy, said Robert Weinberg, the cancer research pioneer whose
laboratory group at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge carried
out the work being reported in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, making human cells cancerous in the lab has been
puzzlingly difficult except by bombarding them with toxic chemicals
and radiation. The new experiment shows that the feat can be
accomplished with precision _ it just takes knowing which few
switches to pull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer cells have been black boxes,'' said Weinberg, but the
new findings give scientists a way to identify and ``catalogue''
the different broken genes inside cells that transform them into
dangerous tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists called the report a ``landmark'' paper that
could aid the search for highly specific cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg suggested that in the future, ``we will be able to take
a cancer cell out of a patient, determine the set of (mutant) genes
that are present, and tailor-make the therapy'' to fit that gene
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer is considered a genetic disease, not because it's
inherited (though a predisposition to it can be) but because broken
or altered genes inside cells are what triggers the cells'
malignant behavior, like growing out of control and invading
healthy tissues. The genes may be altered by chemicals inside the
body or outside it, including substances in food; radiation, or
mistakes occurring during cell division.
</P>
<P>
   As individuals accumulate more DNA changes with age, those
mutations are more likely to send some cells over the brink into
malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Whitehead scientists led by Dr. William C. Hahn
and including Weinberg and others say they have identified just
four basic chemical hurdles that must be overcome to prod a cell
into endless growth _ the hallmark of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes the whole way we look at cancer,'' said Hahn, who
is also an oncologist at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we've taken cancer cells and tried to figure out
what makes them cancerous. Now, we've taken a normal cell and
figured out what the minimum number of changes is...in the future,
we may be able to treat those changes'' to prevent or suppress
cancer, he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years, scientists have been able to transform
rodent cells by inserting mutant genes called ``oncogenes'' into
the cells. These inserted mutant genes disrupt the normal
growth-control mechanisms in the cell, causing the cell to escape
its built-in restraints on chaotic, cancerous growth.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers have found it difficult to duplicate this feat
with human cells, which seem to have more inherent barriers to
becoming malignant.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to find the minimum number of gene changes it would
take to make a human cell malignant, the Whitehead researchers
inserted some logical suspects, one at a time and in combinations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oncogenes they tried was a piece of a monkey virus,
called the SV40 large T antigen. Another was an oncogene called
ras, which is found in many human tumors.
</P>
<P>
   And the third gene was one that causes the cell to make an
enzyme called telomerase. This enzyme keeps the DNA in cells from
deteriorating, as it normally does, when the cell divides. In fact,
the deterioration of DNA in the cell's chromosomes is believed to
be the ``clock'' that consigns human cells to death after a certain
number of divisions. Telomerase, by keeping the DNA intact, in
effect can make cells immortal _ a key feature of cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   However, telomerase by itself, while making the cells immortal,
did not make them malignant _ that is, they did not show all the
features of a truly malignant cell.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitehead group demonstrated that these three genes, when
inserted into skin and embryonic kidney cells in the laboratory,
made the cells immortal and able to cause tumors when injected into
laboratory animals.
</P>
<P>
   The three genes actually caused four crucial changes in the
cells, since the SV40 large T antigen disrupted two separate
growth-control safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying article in Nature, two French scientists
noted that the group had succeeded in answering a question at least
15 years old _ what is the ``minimum number of defined `genetic
hits' (gene mutations) required for tumor formation?'' This
``landmark paper,'' wrote Jonathan B. Weitzman and Moseh Yaniv of
the Institut Pasteur, should spur other scientists to implicate
other genetic ``players'' in causing cancers of different types.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Cancer Institute, researcher Curtis Harris
called the paper ``important'' and said it ``provides another tool
to investigate not only these pathways but drugs that might utilize
these defective pathways to treat cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris heads the laboratory of human carcinogenesis at the NCI.

DOCTORS, NURSES DECRY HMOS' EFFECT ON CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as the US House is poised to take up the contentious matter
of patients' rights, a new national survey of doctors and nurses
concludes that HMOs often refuse to cover care, with serious
consequences for patients much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial percentages of doctors said managed-care plans
overrule their decisions on a monthly or weekly basis, according to
the study, released Wednesday. Among physicians who reported HMO
denials, from 37 to 65 percent said patients had somewhat serious
or very serious deterioration in their health as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurers scrambled to discredit the findings, conducted
by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and the
Kaiser Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This research is subject to real misinterpretation,'' said
Karen Ignani, president of the American Association of Health
Plans. She said its findings are contradicted by prior research _
including a 1995 study from the same researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, added that the survey ``showcases attitudes of doctors and
nurses'' that ``don't mesh with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's defensiveness may reflect its worries about the
politics of patients' rights in Congress, where some Republican
physician-congressmen (and a dentist) have split with party
conservatives who want to limit new federal HMO regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed its version of a patients' rights bill on July
15 on a 53-47 party-line vote. But many Democrats _ and the
renegade Republicans in the House _ say the Senate version isn't
stringent enough and leaves most HMO subscribers' rights to the
uncertainties of state regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors in the House have parted company with their
traditional allies on this issue because they're doctors,'' said
Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Altman said the California-based foundation, which often funds
polls on health issues, is not trying to influence the outcome of
the HMO patients' rights debate. But he maintained the new results
show that problems with managed care ``are not just a bunch of
anecdotes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just about politics,'' Altman said. ``It's about
real problems out there in the health care system. I think this
study shows that whether you're for the Republican or Democratic
approaches, there's a need to reduce the disputes beween health
professionals and health plans and a need for a mechanism to
resolve these disputes when they occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Another national snapshot of HMOs, also released Wednesday,
found that care is improving steadily _ at least among the health
plans that monitor their performance and report on it publicly. But
``there is still substantial room for improvement in managed
care,'' said the National Committee on Quality Assurance, which
compiles the yearly report card for 247 HMOs that voluntarily
report their performance on a dozen quality measures.
</P>
<P>
   The quality gap between high- and low-performing HMOs ``remains
enormous,'' the National Committee said. For instance, the
percentage of diabetic patients who receive annual eye exams to
spot potentially blinding disease ranged from 10 percent in the
worst-performing plans to 80 percent among the best.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of heart disease patients who received beta
blocker drugs to prevent a heart attack ranged from 40 to almost
100 percent. Nationally, an increase in the appropriate use of beta
blockers rose from 63 percent in 1996 to 80 percent last year, an
improvement that has saved an estimated 2,179 lives, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report card found for the second year in a row that New
England HMOs achieved the highest scores nationally, ranking first
on nine of 12 quality measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser-Harvard report, a mail survey involving 1,053 doctors
and 768 nurses selected randomly, is one of the first to document
the frequency and seriousness of health plan denials, at least from
the health professionals' perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are a step closer to real stories and more detailed
quantification of impact of these decisions on patients,'' said
Karen Donelan, the Harvard project leader.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that nearly 9 in 10 physicians reported a care
denial in the previous two years, and a third to two-thirds of
these coverage denials seriously harmed patients, depending on
whether the refusal involved a prescription drug, hospital stay,
diagnostic test, specialist referral, or mental health care. About
half of nurses said HMO decisions had resulted in a decline in
patients' health.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significant, the survey discovered that managed
care denials occur on a regular basis among substantial percentages
of health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Three out of five doctors said HMOs overruled their prescription
drug decisions on a weekly or monthly basis, resulting in a ``very
serious'' decline in patients' health in five percent of cases and
a ``somewhat serious'' deterioration in another 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Physician reports of monthly or weekly denials were less
frequent for diagnostic tests (42 percent), hospital stays (31
percent), specialist referrals (29 percent), and mental health care
(18 percent).
</P>
<P>
   However, adverse consequences were significant, ranging from 39
percent for hospital stays to 46-50 percent for diagnostic tests
and specialist referrals and 65 percent for mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and nurses said they often intervened for patients after
denials _ and sometimes exaggerated patients' conditions to get
coverage. In each doctor's most recent such intervention, the HMO
ruled in the patient's favor 42 percent of the time and compromised
in another 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers compiled a random sample of care providers'
comments on the consequences of care denials. One involved a
60-year-old woman with a stroke. ``Patient denied rehab by HMO
because it had contracts to place patient in a nursing home,'' her
doctor wrote. ``After a 20-day stay, patient was sent to
intermediate care with no therapy and no hope of improving mobility
and ADL (activities of dailing living) status, ending effectively
any hope of independent or assisted living.''

<P>
   Going to a new school? Worried about making the transition to
middle or high school? Want summer to last forever? Keep dreaming.
If you really want to know the truth, there's absolutely nothing to
fret over. In a week or two, you'll have a new best friend and your
whole schedule memorized.
</P>
<P>
   Until then? You could start off like high school sophomore
Krista Farquhar and drive yourself crazy wondering about what all
your friends from last year will think of your new wardrobe
selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent endless hours trying on every piece of clothing in my
closet to make sure I had the perfect outfit picked out,'' she
says.'' Then I'd spend two hours in front of a mirror before school
making sure my makeup and hair looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a good idea to decide the night before what clothes
you want to wear. If you're brave enough to copy a hairstyle from a
magazine, practice taming your locks so you'll know exactly what to
do when you wake up.
</P>
<P>
   A small warning: Upperclassmen are intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way around it,'' says high school student Mary
Stanwood. ``Sixth and ninth grade were definitely the hardest for
me because I thought all the older kids would want to beat me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that eighth-graders and seniors have all been in
your shoes. They may be bigger, but they probably won't try to beat
you up. They'll be so wrapped up in their own lives that they won't
even take time to notice you.
</P>
<P>
   Don't care about what others think. Take advice from Jason
Parks, 16, who says he ``doesn't get nervous 'cause it's just
another year.''
</P>
<P>
   If you keep that in mind, all those imaginary put-downs and
butterflies will disappear. Also, don't be afraid to ask someone
for directions, especially if it's that cutie you've had your eye
on since first period.

   Nobody enjoys getting shots at the doctor's office, but health
officials emphasize that immunizations are extremely important for
school-age children.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not up to date with your shots, many states can
prevent you from starting school on time.
</P>
<P>
   If needles make you twitchy, here are some tips to get through
the injection:
</P>
<P>
   _Breathe slowly and deeply to keep yourself relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   _Hold your mom's or dad's hand for support.
</P>
<P>
   _Be honest with the doctor and nurse about your worries.
</P>
<P>
   _Think about something else, like giving yourself a treat
afterward or being at your favorite place.
</P>
<P>
   _Race the nurse to see if you can count to 10 before she
finishes the injection.

   Those alarm clocks are tuned. Pencils are sharpened. The first
set of grades has been distributed.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't quite up to par, now is the time for students to
rethink their study strategies. Being organized is one of the
secrets to making school more enjoyable and helping students
succeed, according to Dale Jarrett, editor of the Orlando-based
newsletter ``The Get Organized News.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tricks suggested in the newsletter:
</P>
<P>
   _De-clutter closets and dresser drawers so students can find
their clothes easily in the morning and not waste time looking for
socks.
</P>
<P>
   _Clean out the study area. Clutter offers too many distractions
when it is time to do homework.
</P>
<P>
   _Set up a work area with supplies, reference materials, good
lighting, comfy chair, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _Evaluate whether it is more effective to study alone or with a
buddy.
</P>
<P>
   _When doing homework, avoid distractions such as TV. Soft music
is OK _ for some students.
</P>
<P>
   _Create organizers with baskets, shoe boxes, mugs, jars and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   _For kids who prefer to do their homework in bed, acquire a lap
desk and side table with shelves for storage.
</P>
<P>
   _Set up a launch pad near the pantry, den or kitchen where all
school-related items are kept. Include a basket for lunch money,
teacher notes, permission slips, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _Make a checklist of things to be done in the morning and
evening.
</P>
<P>
   _Use a planner or assignment book. Encourage kids to get in the
habit of writing down their assignments and checking them off when
completed.
</P>
<P>
   _Have a planning session to discuss ``what if'' strategies. What
happens if Tommy loses his lunch money? What if John is locked out
of the house when he gets home? What if the car-pool driver forgets
to pick up Suzy?
</P>
<P>
   _Parents can communicate with teachers through sticky notes and
even e-mail, if necessary.

   OK, so your family hasn't won the lottery. Bills for education
can be paid through financial aid, scholarships and grants (you
don't have to pay these back), loans and work/study programs on
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Besides getting top grades or being a super athlete, there are
other opportunities to win scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many students and parents think that scholarships go only to
the most brilliant students, the neediest of the needy or the most
spectacular athletes.'' writes scholarship expert Chris Vuturo in a
news release. But that's ``Not so,'' he says. After doing ``a ton
of research'' as a high school senior, Chris got more than $885,000
in financial aid award offers. Now 27, he's the author of ``The
Scholarship Advisor 1999 Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholarships are available based on such factors as: what you
plan to study, career interest, hobbies/leisure activities, work
experience, athletic ability, minority affiliation, religious
affiliation, disability, gender, military service (yours, your
parents' or your grandparents'), residence and where your parents
work.
</P>
<P>
   The University of North Texas' free booklet for prospective
college students, ``How to Choose the Right College for You,''
lists these tips on financial aid:
</P>
<P>
   _Save your money;
</P>
<P>
   _send forms early;
</P>
<P>
   _proofread your applications because errors will delay the award
process;
</P>
<P>
   _ make a copy in case your information is misplaced.

MARTENS FACES CLASSIC CONTEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTAIC, Calif. _ He was scouting cypress trees on a bayou in
the Deep South for the most important bass tournament of his young
life when something of phenomenal proportions in the black swamp
water took the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm yanking on it and pulling on it and bubbles are coming up
and I thought, `What the hell is this thing?''' said Aaron Martens,
26, of Castaic, a first-time qualifier for the internationally
acclaimed BASS Masters Classic. ``I thought, `I'm here in Louisiana
by myself and I don't know what this thing is.'''
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden ``this thing'' crawled five feet across the
bottom and stopped. ``I back off a little bit because I got a
little scared,'' Martens said. Then the creature broke the surface
and what the angler assumed was a giant catfish turned out to be a
14-foot alligator.
</P>
<P>
   After a few ``oh my Gods,'' he calmed down enough to snap a
couple of shots of the breathtaking catch.
</P>
<P>
   The incident late last month serves as a metaphor for Martens as
he begins the three-day world championship of bass angling today on
the expansive Louisiana Delta and Mississippi River Basin: He
really isn't sure what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I did very well prefishing; I didn't catch
enough fish,'' Martens said during a recent break from packing
artificial lures into two boxes provided by tourney officials, as
required by the unforgiving rules. ``My fishing skills are there;
it will take me a little while to adapt to the fishing conditions
out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' he added. ``I just wish it was somewhere else,
anywhere but the delta. It's so unfair; there is too much water.''
</P>
<P>
   The 45 anglers vying for a share of the $350,000 purse and a
shot at the $100,000 champion's payout _ which comes with beaucoup
sponsorships and household fame in the bass-angling community _ can
basically target the southern half of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   But like the water moccasin that crawled into Martens' boat
motor after the gator disappeared, don't be surprised if this
rookie shows some serious bite; he hasn't won three Angler of the
Year awards in Western professional bass circuits on luck alone.
</P>
<P>
   Martens chatted about his chances in this candid interview with
the Daily News. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DN: What is the biggest challenge?
</P>
<P>
   AM: ``The biggest challenge there is getting better quality
fish. It's hard to get big ones. It's endless water. There are some
areas that have more big ones than other areas. A lot of people
will have a hard time just getting fish. There will be some guys
traveling 2{ to 3 hours to get to a spot. I have a spot that is an
hour and a half away.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: What will it take to win?
</P>
<P>
   AM: ``It will take a (five-bass) limit and one big fish _ 3 to 4
pounds or more _ each day to win. There might be some guys getting
14 to 20 pounds (of bass a day), but, if it's like it was last
month, it'll be more like 10 to 11 pounds. The average fish caught
is a pound and a quarter. I'd be really happy if I got 10 pounds a
day; that would maybe get you in the top five.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: What makes your fishing style suited for this contest?
</P>
<P>
   AM: ``It's flipping and pitching and topwater-fishing mainly,
and that's what I do best.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: What shortcomings could hurt you?
</P>
<P>
   AM: ``The only weakness that will hurt me in this one is not
being on the right fish and not being where the big fish are. It
was too big an area to practice (well).''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Can you win?
</P>
<P>
   AM: ``There's a possibility; I have stuff going on. I want to be
in the top five; that would make me really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Is qualifying for the BASS Masters Classic (by finishing in
the top five in the four-event BASSMASTER Western Invitational
series) your biggest accomplishment?
</P>
<P>
   AM: ``I think my biggest accomplishment was probably quitting my
job (as a gas-station attendant) after I won my first tournament in
October 1993 (in only the second pro tourney he'd fished). This is
probably right up there, and, of course, if I win this it would
take the cake for everything.''

   TRES ESQUINAS, Colombia _ This tangle of jungle and rivers is a
front line in Colombia's war against the twin plagues of drugs and
guerrillas, the place where the United States is betting that it
can help the Colombian military finally gain the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cocaine exported from Colombia is grown in clearings
in the guerrilla-controlled territory surrounding this isolated
Colombian Air Force base. It is the money from the coca grown here
that supports the increasingly successful insurgents, who briefly
this month advanced within 30 miles of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   But now Colombian officials and the Americans who have long been
urging them to be more aggressive against the rebels think they
have found a weapon to turn the tide: a new Anti-Narcotics
Battalion that is being trained and supplied by the United States
for deployment here later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the army of the future in Colombia,'' Defense Minister
Luis Fernando Ramirez said Tuesday at the 1,000-man unit's main
training center in Tolemaida, north of here. ``This is only the
beginning. This is the army we want, and we are going to continue
training battalions like this all over Colombia until we have what
we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Ramirez, accompanied by Gen. Fernando Tapias, the
commander in chief of the Colombian armed forces, flew to
Washington to seek a substantial increase in American aid by asking
for $500 million over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton responded by saying that the United States
increasingly sees the anti-drug effort in Colombia as ``in our
national security interests to do what we can'' to help the country
win the battle.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Colombia is getting $289 million in such assistance,
making it the third-largest recipient of American aid in the world.
But some American officials argue that as much as $1 billion more
may be needed just in the next year to strengthen government forces
in their counternarcotics efforts, which are more and more
difficult to distinguish from the combat with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Narcotics Battalion's mission will be to deny the
country's main leftist guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, its main source of income: the taxes
collected on the coca leaves grown and processed in this area that
have underwritten its recent military surge. Guerrilla groups now
control or operate freely in nearly 40 percent of Colombian
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emergency situation,'' Gen. Barry McCaffrey,
director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control
Policy, said during a visit here Tuesday, part of a three-day trip
to Colombia to assess the deteriorating situation in this country.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of urgency is driven, he said, by awareness that even
``if we seize a drug plane out over the Caribbean, the guerrillas
have already been paid,'' and have used the money to buy arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to brake the dynamic of these groups and the
violence that is produced in Colombia by narcotics trafficking is
to attack their sources of financing,'' said Tapias. ``So long as
we have not reduced the departure of cocaine by half, we will not
be able to begin to weaken these groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, all American military aid to Colombia is intended
exclusively for use in anti-drug efforts, not in counterinsurgency
campaigns. But recent events have eroded the line between those two
concepts, as declarations by Colombian and American officials
Tuesday made clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 25,000 people out there with machine guns, mortars,
rockets and land mines,'' said McCaffrey, a former chief of U.S.
military forces in Latin America. ``We keep arguing over what is it
you call them. I don't know what we ought to call them, but I know
what they're doing: They are operating, they are massing, in forces
of up to a couple of thousand people, and they are carrying out
simultaneous attacks on 11 provinces on the same night.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's poorly equipped and inadequately trained Armed Forces
have in recent years adhered to a largely defensive strategy,
letting the guerrillas come at them and leaving to the police the
burden of trying to root out what are known here as
``narco-guerrilla operations.'' The Anti-Narcotics Battalion is an
effort to reverse the momentum and seize the initiative by putting
soldiers and policemen together in a joint unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task of this battalion is to confront the armed groups on
land and water so that police will be able to move ahead in their
work of fumigation and eradication'' of coca fields protected by
the guerrillas, Tapias said. ``At the moment, our airplanes and
helicopters cannot do that, because they are shot down whenever
they enter this region.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials estimate that on average, between 100 and 150
American military personnel are in Colombia. Tapias said that
``less than a dozen'' were involved in training the battalion at
any one time and that their role ``will definitely end'' when the
program is completed in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans involved in training the new battalion are from
the 7th Special Forces group, based in Fort Bragg, N.C., according
to Colombian and American officials. The areas of instruction they
offer include intelligence, communications, reconnaissance,
riverine operations and mortar use, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Once operations begin in December, though, ``We will not have a
single American soldier here fighting at the side of Colombians,''
Tapias said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the experience, the trained army and a population
willing to help,'' he continued. ``What we do not have, because of
the economic crisis the country is experiencing right now, is the
capacity to acquire the means of mobility and technical
intelligence that we need.''
</P>
<P>
   But human rights and advocacy groups say they are not yet
persuaded by such assurances. They see the new American-supported
force as a first step toward the sort of much deeper and direct
U.S. involvement that occurred in Central America and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that this battalion almost inevitably will
become involved in counterinsurgency operations because of where it
will be deployed and who is involved,'' said Winifred Tate, a
Colombia analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America.
``United States involvement is limited now to special forces
training missions, but it is a very slippery slope from
counternarcotics training to taking on an adviser's role.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The base, which consists of a landing strip, barracks and
communications center near the confluence of the Caqueta and
Orteguaza rivers, has also been the subject of much speculation
among Colombians, thanks largely to the decision of the U.S.
Embassy in Bogota to declare it off-limits to Colombian and
American reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, fanciful tales of Green Berets in fierce
combat with guerrillas have proliferated, raising suspicions about
the stated purpose of the base and the battalion.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns have also been expressed in Colombia and abroad about
human rights issues. Human rights groups have long complained about
links between the Colombian armed forces and right-wing
paramilitary groups that have massacred civilians, and it was
partly in order to alleviate those preoccupations that a special
vetting procedure was used in recruiting members of the battalion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the unit's curriculum includes a heavy dose of
human-rights training, including case studies in which soldiers are
presented with battlefield situations and told how they should
behave.
</P>
<P>
   After viewing several such presentations during his visit to the
training center Tuesday, McCaffrey described himself as encouraged
by the battalion's fighting capacity and its willingness to abide
by international law.
</P>
<P>
   While ``there is always a question in the minds of people
looking at this,'' if properly trained, ``that's what these kids
will tend to do in the field of operations,'' he said. ``You get
these 18-year-old soldiers, you give them these lessons, and I
think it makes a difference.''

DEUTSCHE TELECOM IN TALKS WITH ONE2ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This has been added to the Business Day front page)  
(lh) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom AG, Germany's largest telecommunications
company, is in talks to buy One2One, the British mobile telephone
concern jointly owned by London-based Cable and Wireless and
Mediaone Group, the Colorado-based Internet service provider that
recently agreed to be acquired by AT&AMP;T Corp., said people close to
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is struck _ and it is always possible another bidder
will emerge _ Deutsche Telekom could pay $12 billion for One2One,
far lower than what One2One hoped to get when it put itself up for
auction several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, several companies were said to be interested in the
wireless concern, including France Telecom, Germany's Mannesmann
and Telecom Italia Mobile SpA. But on July 14, Mannesmann said it
had pulled out of the bidding because One2One's asking price _
believed to be about $17 billion _ was too high.
</P>
<P>
   One2One had also discussed the prospect of an initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom has also talked with France Telecom and Sprint
Corp., the long-distance and local communications provider, about
potentially dissolving Global One, the troubled international joint
venture backed by the three companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those discussions have included negotiations about splitting up
Global One's assets, said an executive close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's role in the Global One joint venture has been
troubled for some time. Deutsche Telekom angered executives at
France Telecom in April when it announced its intent to merge with
Telecom Italia, the telecommunications giant that was the subject
of a $63 billion hostile takeover by Italian rival Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's reputation was battered when investors
scoffed at its offer, and it ultimately lost Telecom Italia to
Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom said then it was not consulted regarding the
merger with Telecom Italia. And in May, it began legal proceedings
against Deutsche Telekom, contending a fundamental breach by
Deutsche Telekom of a strategic partnership agreements signed late
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Both Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom own 10 percent of
Sprint, but any discussions about an outright merger between Sprint
and Deutsche Telekom are ``far off,'' said a person close to the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   However the company proceeds, it is clear that Deutsche is
exploring any and all options to gain stronger footing in the
changing European telecommunications market, particularly the
quickly growing Internet arena. Deutsche Telekom, said an executive
who spoke on condition of anonymity, is still trying to decide
whether to start a single splashy deal, like a bid for Sprint, or
to embark on a series of smaller acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   News of a possible acquisition of Sprint and the possible sale
of One2One to Deutsche Telekom were reported in the German daily
newspaper Handelsblatt. It said too, citing an unnamed Telekom
source, that the company was in preliminary talks with America
Online Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Qwest Communications
International. Qwest last week announced a $35 billion merger with
regional Bell company US West. And a person close to those
companies said a deal with Qwest was ``purely speculative'' and no
discussions have taken place in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Cable and Wireless, MediaOne Group and Sprint
declined to comment on the reports. A Qwest spokesman would not
comment.

SWORDBOAT TALE A FULL-COURSE MEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Here's one book that has no problem hooking
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Greenlaw's ``The Hungry Ocean: A Swordboat Captain's
Journey'' (Hyperion; $22.95) has portrayed the details of life on a
swordfish boat down to the last leader.
</P>
<P>
   While most books would drown in the quantity of information she
has packed in, Greenlaw keeps a lively pace. Her description in the
266 pages is so vivid and her writing so crisp the narrative
doesn't slow down anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Consider her description of her quarry: ``A streamlined and
muscular missile with a bayonet, the swordfish is strong, swift and
agile.'' And of dusk on the ocean: ``When the sun sets at sea, the
drop in temperature is immediate, like turning a corner in the
grocery store to enter the aisle of frozen pizza _ it's that
sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maine resident chronicles the events of one 30-day swordfish
trip, including not only the workaday details necessary to catch
the game but crew personalities and conflicts, her demanding boss
and communication with other boats. She has interspersed this with
profane anecdotes from earlier trips, such as trying to keep a dead
man frozen before reaching shore.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran anglers will fully realize one crucial matter for
oceangoing fishermen _ finding and protecting a spot, called
berthing. She was so anxious to continue her success at one berth
that she even fibbed to other nearby captains who asked how well
she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw has a love-hate relationship with the sea. Fishing is a
job without a salary, with no weekends, no holidays, no personal or
sick days. Captains and crew members are rarely able to have more
than three or four hours of sleep a night. Storms, equipment
hazards, rogue waves and the very real risk of falling overboard
make fishing one of the most dangerous professions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Greenlaw is in love with the sea. She fishes to make
money, she writes, but urges anyone who dislikes the work to get
out. Too many factors are outside the control of captains and crew
_ not only the ocean itself but the quality of the fishing and,
most importantly, the price per pound of swordfish.
</P>
<P>
   She started her affair with the sea at an early age and never
allowed her gender to get in the way. She hates being called a
``fisherwoman'' and is as good at taking and dishing out
self-effacing humor as any of the men on board.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw has more than her share of salty tales. She noticed one
fishing boat adrift, going first one way and then another, and
received no response when she called the captain. The crew had
fallen asleep. The captain had awakened only because he needed to
relieve himself after drinking a six-pack of beer. Greenlaw's crew
dubbed the captain Rip Van Tinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other fishermen who wax poetic about the one that got
away, Greenlaw has only bitter feelings. A huge swordfish, larger
than she had ever caught (so she says) even did a ``victory lap''
after escaping from the deck of a vessel in an earlier trip.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the hard work and unsavory aspects of shipboard
life, she has a mysterious bond with the sea. Our rating: HHH{ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're in Las Vegas. Why not peruse the configurations of a
topographic map as carefully as you're studying those playing cards
at the blackjack table?
</P>
<P>
   Matt Purdue's ``Adventure Guide to Nevada'' (Hunter Publishing;
$15.95) can provide an ideal point of departure for those visiting
the Silver State. The best part of the 208-page title is its
acknowledgment of reality: Most people will be driving through the
state, not backpacking, and will spend at least some time in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue includes a generous selection of hikes from every part of
the state, but he does more. He provides information for car tours
to such locales as the Extraterrestrial Highway, ghost towns like
Rhyolite and some lesser-known places, including Mesquite, which is
trying to establish its own running of the bulls a la Pamplona,
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevada'' passes the ultimate guidebook test: It makes you want
to visit there. The photos, though only black and white, are more
than adequate, and the author _ a Santa Monica magazine editor and
occasional contributor to the Daily News _ has included a generous
sampling of restaurants and motels in addition to places for
hiking, touring and camping that are surprisingly scenic. He also
had the foresight to provide a large chapter on the Las Vegas area.
He has the area pegged. Our rating: HH{ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another book with a desert backdrop takes a distinctly different
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Awakenings: A Unique Journey Through America's Splendid
Southwest'' (NorthWord Press; $29.95) is a 160-page coffee-table
offering with fine photos of the Painted, Sonoran, Colorado,
Chihuahuan, Great Basin deserts and other arid regions.
</P>
<P>
   The images by Jeff Gnass are awesome; that's required of a book
with such broad proportions. Included are shots of well-known
areas, such as the Grand Canyon, Anza-Borrego and Death Valley, and
of underappreciated sites such as the Mojave Desert, the Great
Basin Desert of California and Nevada and Texas' Big Bend National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   They are married with text penned by John A. Murray that is both
naturalistic and mystical. While the journey he takes us on is
enjoyable, there are a few lapses into overly romantic nature
worship: ``Only the wind knows, and it is not telling.'' No, it's
not, so don't mention the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Most readers won't mind this since they are attracted to the
visual content, and the writing is decent as long as Murray strives
for prose, not poetry. Our rating: HH{ &UR;  &QL;

NEW ENGLAND'S LARGEST HMO PLANS 15 PERCENT PREMIUM INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Members of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, New England's
largest health maintenance organization, can expect to pay an
average of 12 percent to 15 percent more next year in health
insurance premiums, according to the HMO's new chief executive,
Charles D. Baker Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The rate hike, the steepest for Harvard Pilgrim members in more
than six years, is a cornerstone in the HMO's plans unveiled
Wednesday to rebuild its finances. Harvard Pilgrim last year lost
an unprecedented $54 million and appears to be losing money at an
even faster rate so far this year. Baker estimated Harvard Pilgrim
has already lost more than $45 million in the first six months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   To stem the losses, Harvard Pilgrim's aggressive turnaround plan
also involves laying off hundreds of workers, completely revamping
its notoriously arcane computer systems, selling off chunks of
assets, and exiting unprofitable markets.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Wednesday declined to specify how many of the HMO's 4,400
employees would be laid off in the coming months, but estimated
that efforts to ``reduce administrative costs'' would save up to
$75 million over the next six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the HMO is expecting a one-time windfall of up to
$50 million from selling various assets, including a
240,000-square-foot office building adjacent to Boston in Quincy
and its money-draining Rhode Island operations, which cares for
155,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Harvard Pilgrim's turnaround plan involves
overhauling its computer systems, which Baker characterized as a
``mess'' as he produced a two-page diagram of the HMO's computer
system that resembled a rat's nest of interconnected rectangles and
circles.
</P>
<P>
   For Harvard Pilgrim's patients and doctors, the convoluted
computer matrix has resulted in thousands of unpaid bills,
improperly denied claims, and general confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walt Kagan, an oncologist with Commonwealth Hemotology
Oncology in Quincy, said his practice has unpaid claims he sent to
Harvard Pilgrim in 1997. Harvard Pilgrim, which once owed the
practice more than $500,000, was so far behind on its payments that
Kagan's practice had to once borrow ``a couple hundred thousand
dollars'' to pay its employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have a problem collecting their premiums, they just
cut people off,'' Kagan said of Harvard Pilgrim. ``We can't do that
to our patients. It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan said the HMO has been making an effort to catch up on its
payments, but that progress has been frustratingly uneven.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Stott, operations manager of Women's Health Care, an
obstetrical practice in West Newbury, said Harvard Pilgrim owes his
practice $60,000 in claims, 50 percent of which are more than 90
days overdue. By contrast, only 4 percent of claims to Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Massachusetts are similarly past due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Harvard Pilgrim is our worst payer,'' Stott said.
</P>
<P>
   Furious, physicians and hospitals have filed legislation on
Beacon Hill to force insurance companies to pay on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a case of simple fairness that HMOs pay their
bills on time,'' said Judy Glasser, spokeswoman for the
Massachusetts Hospital Association, who noted that Harvard Pilgrim
is not the only insurer with problems paying its bills.
``Twenty-four other states have filed timely payment legislation,
so it's not unique to Harvard Pilgrim.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker promised an eventual end to the technical snarls that have
plagued the health plan for years. His plan involves outsourcing
Harvard Pilgrim's claims processing tasks to Perot Systems Corp.,
based in Dallas. The $300-million, five-year contract with Perot
Systems calls for Perot Systems to take over Harvard Pilgrim's
computer systems, process all claims, maintain and upgrade the
computers, and manage the large databases containing the company's
medical and financial information.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether the 1,100 Harvard Pilgrim employees
currently working on the company's information systems will become
Perot Systems employees, remain on Harvard Pilgrim's payroll, or be
laid off.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2001, Baker wants a much simpler computer system
where patients and health care providers can use personal computers
to communicate with the HMO, file claims, enroll, or check
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the errors and the gunk that creates the clogs, bumps, and
denials go away because we will be dealing with a much simpler
system on a real-time basis,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's turnaround plan mirrors steps recently taken
by Blue Cross, which in response to steep losses also raised
premiums, sold assets, shed unprofitable businesses, laid off
workers, outsourced computer-related functions, and simplified
contracts with customers and vendors. Blue Cross' efforts appear to
have paid off; the company was the only health insurer in
Massachusetts to have made money in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care observers say Harvard Pilgrim is on the right track
in trying to clean up its Frankensteinian computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to generate the information that allows them to
understand where they spend their money,'' said Phil Caper, chief
executive of Codman Research, a managed-care information systems
company in Lyme, N.H. ``It really points out the growing urgency
among plans to get control of their expenses.''

SWISS RIVER DEATHS FUEL QUESTIONS ABOUT `CANYONING'

<P>
   INTERLAKEN, Switzerland _ With the death toll up to 19, and
Swiss rescue workers still searching the rapids for two missing
tourists, the river disaster in this pristine Swiss resort town on
Tuesday is already raising questions about the inherent dangers of
the adventure sport known as ``canyoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five clients from as far away as Australia and South
Africa, most of them young and thrill-seeking, signed up on Tuesday
with the Swiss company Adventure World to experience the adrenaline
rush of using their bodies to slide down a rope through Alpine
waterfalls, swimming through rapids, or hopping from rock to rock.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden, pronounced downpour swelled their mountain stream into
a torrent. It swept at least 19 people, including three of the
eight guides, to their death; six people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Local police have not completed their investigation of what is
the worst tragedy in the sport's history, and Swiss authorities
Wednesday suspended all canyoning expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy has focused attention on how affluent members of
society often straddle a thin line between calculated risk and
recklessness. Interlaken, a charming village of wood chalets and
neatly trimmed flower beds 40 miles south of the capital of Bern,
has in the '90s become the kind of youth mecca that Amsterdam was
in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of seeking drugs and rock music, twentysomething
backpackers, many of them American, gather to mingle and experience
the summertime high of extreme sports: paragliding, rafting, ice
climbing, bungee jumping, and canyoning.
</P>
<P>
   Interlaken's quaint streets are lined with shops selling and
renting mountain bicycles, hiking boots, rafts, ropes and wet
suits. Young people hang out at scruffy youth hostels like one
called Funny Farm sipping beer by the pool, enveloped in pop music
and strewn extreme-sports gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the thing to do, you go to Interlaken, and you go
canyoning,'' said Heather, a 23-year-old Californian who had
canyoned for the first time the morning of the accident; she was in
a beginner's level excursion of nine clients and two guides
provided by Adventure World. She had no training, and received none
from the company. She refused to give her last name.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had no previous climbing or rafting experience, and
was scared at first, but found the sport ``really exciting.'' She
added, ``I never felt unsafe. I wanted to carry on, I wished it
would get harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if, after the accident, she would try it again, she
hesitated. ``I don't know, now.''
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities and representatives of Adventure World
canceled an afternoon meeting Wednesday with reporters, without
explanation. At a news conference earlier in the day, local
officials said they had not yet identified the dead. Police
officers said identification could take several days and asked
relatives of the missing to bring dental records, X-rays and other
data that could help identify the victims.
</P>
<P>
   They said the victims, four women and 15 men, came from
Australia, New Zealand, Britain, South Africa, and Switzerland. No
Americans were believed to have died in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's consul general in Geneva, Malcolm Skelly, told
Australian radio that most of the victims were Australian and New
Zealanders. He said he spoke to one injured Australian who
survived, and was told, ``Everything happened in a flash,'' and
that the group was in the river bed ``when suddenly the water swept
everything away.''
</P>
<P>
   Georg Hoedle, the founder of Adventure World Company, was
visibly shaken when he told Swiss television Wednesday, ``I am
terribly sorry for the victims and those left behind.'' But neither
he nor other company representatives have given much information
about the fateful excursion. It is not yet known, for example,
whether the 45 clients were on a beginner's course, or a more
advanced one.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has yet to explain why the afternoon excursion
was carried out when weather services predicted thunderstorms.
Local people said the sky began turning cloudy and dark by early
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site Wednesday posted a condolence note (``The
accident is the most tragic occurrence, that has come upon us. It
has shaken us to the core, and we would like to express our deepest
sympathies to all those involved.'') and went on to give a company
profile, boasting that it had served 28,400 clients since its
founding in 1993 and that its team of guides ``consists of
experienced Adventure-professionals from all parts of the world.
Safety is our highest priority in all activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at the main offices of Adventure World, a modern
chalet-style brown-shingle building in Wilderswil, a hamlet outside
Interlaken, red-eyed company employees turned reporters away,
saying they could not yet discuss the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Marooned in Interlaken, banned from the extreme sports that drew
them, many would-be canyoners huddled in morose groups, reviewing a
sport that is popular around the world; in the United States the
sport, known as canyoneering, is typically practiced in a less
extreme form than in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been us,'' Gina Onorato, 19, of Baltimore, said.
She and her friend Melena Pappas, 20, had heard about canyoning
from other tourists they met traveling in Europe, and had signed up
for an excursion Wednesday morning, which was canceled after the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said it's the best thing, you've got to do it,'' she
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Though traveling through Europe, even by backpack, is an
expensive pastime, canyoning is relatively cheap. Five different
adventure sports companies operate in the Bern region, with average
prices ranging from the equivalent of about $55 for a half day to
about $135 for a full day.
</P>
<P>
   Affordability has popularized the sport. Its popularity may have
blurred its inherent risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept asking, `Is it dangerous?''' Ms. Onorato said.
``Everyone said, `Oh no, people do it all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two girls said they were cutting short their stay in
Interlaken. ``We're leaving for Paris tomorrow,'' Ms. Onorato said.
``It's dead here now.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The accident was first discovered around 6 p.m. Tuesday by a
jogger who saw bodies floating in Lake Brienz. The bodies had swept
into the lake from the Lutchine River, which is fed by the Saxeten
Brook, where the excursion began about 90 minutes earlier.
Canyoners routinely wear wet suits and crash helmets. Most of the
victims were said to have worn lifejackets.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains began around 5 p.m. and did not let up for two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding, caused by rain and also melting snow from surrounding
Alpine peaks, are a frequent hazard in the area. In 1987, heavy
rains caused the Saxeten to double in volume, flooding parts of the
nearest village, Wilderswil. The most recent canyoning fatality in
the Bern region occurred in 1997, when a 24-year-old man's rapel
cord caught on a rock, and he drowned in the rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Some canyoning experts dismissed the accident as an
unforeseeable act of God. ``I heard that the water came down like
an avalanche. There is nothing you can do in that situation,'' said
Felix Schmidhalter, an independent canyoning and mountain guide who
works for another sports adventure company, ``No Limits Center'' in
Verbier, Switzerland. ``You know skiing is usually safe, but the
day you have an avalanche, what can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think for a while there will be fewer people
canyoning, but in France and Switzerland lots of people canyon or
climb. They will start again.''
</P>
<P>
   People living in the area, however, took a dimmer view of the
sporting fad that has made Interlaken a lure for restless youth.
``I think these young foreigners, they find life too dull, they
want thrills,'' Eva Seiler, a 66-year-old retired cosmetics store
owner said as she waited for police to lift a blockade to the
stream where the deaths occurred, which runs past her house. ``But
all these schools and companies, they are profiting from the
boredom.''

L.A. RAIDERS? WHY NOT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They staged another one of those silly NFL owners meetings
Wednesday to let everyone know across the country that Los Angeles
is no closer to getting an expansion team than it was the last time
the NFL owners staged such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They have another one of these well-choreographed frolics
scheduled for September, and I'm sure the outcome for L.A. will be
just as murky as ever unless L.A.'s divine trinity of Eli Broad, Ed
Roski and Michael Ovitz substitute all their grandiose rhetoric
with millions and millions of their own dollars, which they're
obviously not inclined to do.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why L.A. is so obsessed with securing an expansion
franchise that would be a fiscal strain and artistic failure when
it might be able to bring back an established team, the Raiders,
that badly wants to get out of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   While many patrons in Southern California blanch at the idea of
Al Davis's reappearance and harbor a bitter dislike for the
Raiders' owner, the fact is his team wouldn't present the financial
strain peculiar to an NFL expansion enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL eventually decides to bestow its 32nd team to
Houston, a distinct possibility in light of L.A.'s tenuous position
at the moment, then Davis' Raiders would be a viable alternative
providing, of course, they can break away from the lease they have
with Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Please, cease with the curses, lower the volume, stop with the
anti-Al Davis venting.
</P>
<P>
   We can forgive Al Davis for his past sins, for his committing
perhaps the most feckless miscalculation in L.A. sporting history
in 1994 when he decided to return the Raiders to Oakland after
(italicize after) Georgia Frontiere shifted the Rams to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we are a country with a treasured history of
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, we've forgiven a president who's been telling one
whopper after another for almost eight years, climaxing with his
celebrated TV disclaimer about having sex with a White House intern
half his age.
</P>
<P>
   We've forgiven Marv Albert, exiled from his broadcasting booth a
couple of years for bizarre conduct with a female companion,
including assault.
</P>
<P>
   I flunked math and unfortunately can't count how many times
we've forgiven Mike Tyson for his endless indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Steve Howe, who was busted for cocaine usage
even more than Darryl Strawberry, another guy who benefits from our
let-bygones-be-bygones nature.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, baseball's hierarchy refuses to forgive Pete Rose, even
though I'd venture to say that 90 percent of the game's fans think
it's shameful that Rose isn't in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   We certainly have in it our hearts to bury the hatchet with Al
Davis, an eccentric fellow who on an implausible whim decided to
pull up roots here at a time when his Raiders had the entire L.A.
basin to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure L.A. fans, notoriously fickle and card-carrying
front-runners, would warmly embrace an expansion franchise, the
thought of which doesn't exactly inspire my passions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the politicians in this area are determined to bring a
brand new team to the Coliseum, an outdated piece of junk that
should have been torn down years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They have used their influence to keep privately-owned stadiums
from being erected at Dodger Stadium and Hollywood Park, and have
forced the NFL to reluctantly accept the Coliseum as the most
practical venue to stick a new team.
</P>
<P>
   The sterling governor of California, Mr. Gray Davis, even has
got involved in this L.A. football issue, throwing an emissary, a
gentleman named Bill Chadwick, into the cauldron.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick supposedly has done terrific behind-the-scenes work and
accelerated the process for L.A.'s football interests.
</P>
<P>
   I say supposedly because the NFL owners still are playing it
quite coyly with L.A. for the most logical reason imaginable _
money.
</P>
<P>
   Those representing L.A. want the NFL to pitch in $150 million to
help defray costs on Coliseum renovations and parking structures.
</P>
<P>
   The league owners understandably aren't enthusiastic about
parting with such a sum it would cost each about $5 million for a
municipally owned stadium that would be used for a mere 10 NFL
games a year.
</P>
<P>
   The owners also are seeking at least $500 million in expansion
fees from L.A. While there are plenty of individuals in these parts
easily able to come up with such a vast amount Broad and Roski, to
name just two none has been willing (italicize willing) to do so.
</P>
<P>
   So what's going to happen?
</P>
<P>
   It won't surprise me if Houston, which is building a new stadium
and has all the financial resources in place, eventually winds up
with a team, a development that would leave me coldly indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has discovered it can survive quite nicely without L.A.
the value of the league's franchises has increased dramatically in
recent years but we here have discovered we also can survive quite
nicely without the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It's a standoff, and I hate seeing our representatives toadying
up to the NFL, hands out, hoping the league blesses them with an
expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the spectacle has become so nauseating that I find
myself actually pulling for an Al Davis sequel.

YOUTHFUL DRINKING, DRIVING ON RISE, REPORT FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROB NELSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The rate of drunken driving among teenagers and young
adults in Massachusetts is rising at an alarming rate, leading to
increased deaths and dangerous conditions on Bay State roads,
according to a comprehensive state study of underage drinking
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the number of juveniles charged with
drunken driving nearly doubled between 1993 and 1997, while the
percentage of juveniles on probation for alcohol abuse-related
offenses jumped from 25 percent in 1987 to 42 percent two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings that more teenagers _ who are not legally
able to buy liquor _ are driving drunk is especially disturbing
because it comes at a time when adult drunken driving court cases
are declining, says the report issued by the Massachusetts Trial
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing an emerging pattern of greater alcohol abuse by
teenagers, coupled with a rising incidence of drunken driving and
even motor vehicle homicide crimes by adolescents, points to a need
for greater understanding of this small but significant population
of drunk drivers,'' stated the report, prepared by the trial
court's probation commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the study, researchers focused on 117 people between
17 and 20 years old who had been arrested for drunken driving in
the 1980s. They found that 17 percent had a prior drunken driving
arrest and 22 percent had been charged with other motor vehicle
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which its authors say is the state's first long-term
research project on juveniles and drunken driving, also found that
underage drunk drivers had a high likelihood of continuing to drink
and drive.
</P>
<P>
   State officials tracked the 117 young drunken driving offenders
for 10 years and found that four out of 10 had at least one
subsequent arrest for driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad commentary on what our society is like,'' said
Raymond Crowley, the chief probation officer for Hampden Juvenile
Court. ``It's a signficant indicator that something is going
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, the statewide total of juveniles charged
with driving under the influence of alcohol jumped from 38 in 1993
to 68 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1994, the state dropped the blood-aclohol level needed to
charge drivers under 21 with drunken driving from .10 to .02 _
equal to one drink _ which may account for the sudden spike.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers, noting that juveniles cannot legally drink,
said the trend toward greater underage drunken driving is still
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the number of juveniles charged with
motor vehicle homicides rose from three in 1994 to 10 two years
ago. ``The small but rising number of motor vehicle homicide cases
where the driver was a juvenile raises another alarm,'' the report
noted.
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings do not surprise Barbara Harrington,
executive director of the state's chapter of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely confirms the importance of the work MADD has
done to understand the problem of underage drinking in this
country,'' she said, adding that the organization had recently
changed its misssion statement to include targeting underage
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said one possible way to curb the number of repeat
drunken driving offenders is to require mandatory supervised care
for anyone convicted of driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that data from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism have shown that teens who start drinking at age 13
have a 47 percent chance of developing a lifelong dependency on
alcohol. But, Harrington added, that percentage drops to 10 percent
if young adults do not start drinking until they reach the legal
drinking age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most of us have thought for years has turned out to be
true and has been substantiated by this study,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Crowley added, he has started to recognize the
names and faces of youthful offenders who are repeatedly brought
into court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message that we've got to meet this problem head
on,'' Crowley said, adding that underage drinking is a problem that
should not fall solely on the shoulders of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes back to the breakdown of the family,'' he said.
``There are more youngsters today who have less supervision. This
is everybody's problem _ the family, the schools, the Department of
Social Services.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Cicchetti, director of research for the state's Office of
Probation, said the report's findings point to one way to combat
underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It emphasized the need for early intervention with this part
of the population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cicchetti said his office would expand its research on underage
drinking by taking a more in-depth look at the backgrounds of
juveniles with more than one drunken driving arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to develop a good sense of who these kids are and why
they got involved in these problems,'' Cicchetti said.

SENIOR MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE TO LEAVE MANAGEMENT JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The (plus plus) words in story should by replaced by the

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Maritz, a senior executive at Microsoft Corp., is returning
to his roots as a programmer as part of the company's campaign to
persuade software developers to continue to rely on its technology
despite the rise of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal e-mail to colleagues on Monday, Maritz, a group
vice president, said he was handing off most of his day-to-day
management duties to work more closely with Bill Gates, the
chairman, to help ``set technical direction in the company'' and
``to educate myself on the details of technologies that I have not
had the chance to be as `hands on' as I would have liked over the
last several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Maritz said he intended to begin his technical-immersion project
by ``writing some'' code using various Microsoft software tool kits
including Visual Basic, Visual C(plus plus) and Visual J(plus
plus), and move on to Microsoft's new programming projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``So be warned,'' Maritz wrote to the other members of
Microsoft's developers group.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail, Maritz said he also planned to focus on promoting
Microsoft's development tools within the software community.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz's hands-on push into the technology of development tools,
colleagues say, comes as Microsoft is engaged in an effort to both
simplify the process of software development and marry its Windows
technology with the technology of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Internet-based computing poses a continuing
challenge, which has been called the post PC era, to Microsoft. The
challenge is not that personal computers might go away, or even
decline in number, but that computing may no longer revolve so much
around PC technology _ which Microsoft dominates with its
industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Microsoft is trying to persuade outside developers
to use its software tools instead of the tools of rivals like Sun
Microsystems Inc. The goal is to position Microsoft's tools as the
glue between PC and Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has the experience and respect, both inside and outside
Microsoft, to push that initiative hard,'' one Microsoft engineer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Maritz was
passing off most of his daily management duties to David
Vaskevitch, a vice president in the developers group.
</P>
<P>
   Like many senior Microsoft executives, Maritz, 44, who joined
the company in 1986 from Intel Corp., is immensely wealthy from his
Microsoft shares. In recent months, a number of other top company
executives have taken leaves of absence or left the company.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz's move to relinquish most daily management duties raised
the question of whether he, too, was about to step out. But in his
e-mail, he suggested that was not the case. His shift of
assignments, he wrote, did not portend ``some major change, or that
I am about to leave the company.'' &QL;

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ ``You look pretty normal,'' Penny the hooker says
upon meeting her latest, immaculately dressed trick in his crummy
skid row room. ``This hotel is full of freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she meets his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin Falls Idaho'' starts off with such a bizarre, eerie
ambience, you think someone made a mistake with the title and
really meant ``Twin Peaks.'' But this first feature by the
identical twin Polish brothers _ Mark writes, Michael directs and
co-writes, both act _ turns into a sweet, quirky little love story
with what can only be described as an intriguing twist.
</P>
<P>
   Blake (Mark Polish) and Francis (Michael) Falls are conjoined
twins, ex-sideshow performers with two arms, three working legs and
two hearts between them. Blake has the stronger constitution;
indeed, Francis would not survive a separation from his brother's
life-pumping circulatory system. But the deeper question is, can
either Blake or Francis survive emotionally free of the one person
who's always _ and we do mean always _ been there for them?
</P>
<P>
   This subject comes up not only because of Francis' failing
health, but because Penny, well-played by waif-vamp model Michelle
Hicks, takes an interest in the boys after overcoming her initial
revulsion. The deal is, despite her profession, Penny is
fundamentally a loner. While the polite, generally good-humored
brothers inevitably evoke a sympathetic response and bring out her
protective instincts, Penny mostly is inspired by their concern for
one another, the way they communicate in whispered semaphores, even
how they can play the guitar as one entity.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to be a part of this unique togetherness, and she does
so by romantic overtures to both twins, although her preference
seems to be for Blake. Naturally, this leads to jealousy and
confusion, but is Francis jealous of Blake or of Penny?
</P>
<P>
   All three principals' emotional agendas are just ambiguous
enough to keep the story intriguing _ and honest, since there's no
easy solution to this triangle's basic predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Polish the director does a good job of putting the audience in
Penny's shoes, shooting everything at first under sickly colored
lights, then in warmer tones as she gets to know the Falls brothers
as people. And whatever her personality flaws may be, that open,
accepting nature becomes her saving grace. As everyone else who
encounters the boys instantly assigns them to one kind of
conceptual box or another, she remains committed to discovering
more about who they really are.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as we naturally gravitate toward her point of view,
we're also made privy to the twins' hermetic existence. It turns
out that they're not all that different, just longing for love and
acceptance and fearful of rejection like the rest of us, only in an
understandably extreme context.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the movie's great strengths, but also the
wellspring of its most nagging weakness. While ``Twin Falls' ''
journey from freak show to touching human drama is certainly
admirable, some unfortunately maudlin notes are struck along the
way. They cheapen what, for the most part, is a rigorous, absorbing
little picture that avoids sensationalism while insistently
exploring lives we don't see in movies every day. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A kind of low-budget appetizer for Martin
Scorsese's upcoming ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' ``Broken Vessels''
follows a pair of paramedics on a 911 call to their own doom.
</P>
<P>
   A stylish, gritty little number that should alarm anyone who's
even considering having a medical emergency, the movie ultimately
blows a lot of good acting and persuasive ambience on, well, too
many drugs. In director Scott Ziehl and co-writers David Baer and
John McMahon's minimum-wage L.A., everybody's flying high on one
kind of controlled substance or another. This includes the people
you call when someone ODs.
</P>
<P>
   Our unreliable narrator is Tom (Jason London), a med school grad
from Pennsylvania with a quizzical wish to ply the low-paying
ambulance trade. He's assigned to veteran driver Jimmy (Todd Field,
seen briefly in ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and even more briefly in ``The
Haunting''), who's burned through an inordinately high number of
rookie partners.
</P>
<P>
   Tom soon discovers why. Although personable and dedicated to
back-watching teamwork, Jimmy drinks, smokes all kinds of dope and
turns the back of the unit into a rolling love machine, all while
on duty. He shakes down dealers at drug emergency calls and buys
illegal pharmaceuticals from the driver's seat. Jimmy's only real
relationships are with his nursing home-bound grandfather (who is
also a junkie) and his speed-freak sculptress neighbor (Susan
Traylor), who eventually establishes a meth lab in her garage.
</P>
<P>
   The apparently impressionable Tom is sucked deeper and deeper
into the deceptively ``together'' Jimmy's living pipe dream. Tom's
only potential escape route, a relationship with a sweet young
nurse (Roxana Zal, who produced the film with Ziehl), is inevitably
fumbled. You feel for the lost kid, yet there are indications,
well-planted, that he's not the corrupted innocent he appears to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broken Vessels'' is strongest when it illustrates the workaday
horrors paramedics must deal with, and with how these particular
rescuing angels abuse the trust the public unthinkingly places in
them. The style ranges from the vulgar verite of TV's ``Cops'' to
more expressionistic stretches, with some well-deployed humor
worked in to relieve the overall grimness.
</P>
<P>
   The acting remains very good as Tom and Jimmy's narcotic spiral
takes over the narrative, but it's something we've seen in a
hundred other movies that didn't start out as distinctively as this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointing and tedious as it may become, ``Broken Vessels''
remains a well-observed and smartly executed slice-of-life drama.
And while it surely doesn't represent the general quality of
ambulance attendants in our fair megalopolis, it sure gives you a
lot to ponder that you probably never otherwise would have _ or
would have wanted to. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Broken Vessels'' (R; drug use, violence, sex,
language, nudity). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Todd Field, Jason London, Roxana Zal, Susan Traylor. &UR;  &QL;

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Be careful how quickly you analyze trades. You never know how
they're going to look one year later.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday marks the one-year anniversary of the Astros'
improbable coup that lured Randy Johnson from Seattle in exchange
for a trio of minor-leaguers whose names might as well have been
Mo, Curly and Larry as far as most were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle's haul in the trade _ righthanded pitcher Freddy
Garcia, lefthanded pitcher John Halama and infielder Carlos Guillen
_ hardly looks like the Three Stooges these days. Despite suffering
a season-ending knee injury after playing in just five games,
Guillen is still regarded as the Mariners' second baseman of the
future. And Garcia and Halama are 10-5 and 7-2, respectively, as
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The criticism) was understandable,'' Mariners manager Lou
Piniella said of the heat his team took for the so-called no-names
they received in the trade. ``You would think when you trade a
Randy Johnson, you would get immediate help. But I'll tell you
what: It looks like a good deal now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Johnson, he bolted for Arizona as a free agent during the
offseason and is 10-8 with a 2.65 ERA and a major-league-leading
240 strikeouts for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   So was the joke on the Astros? Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson didn't pitch them to the World Series _ the
ultimate goal of the trade _ he didn't do anything to hurt their
chances, posting a 10-1 record in 11 starts and a 1.28 ERA with a
.191 opponents' batting average.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Unit also attracted big crowds, luring an average of
45,655 (more than 15,000 above the season average) to his five
starts at the Astrodome. And while that all seems a distant memory
in life after Johnson, no one associated with the Astros regrets
the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do it again 100 times out of 100,'' said Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker, baseball's reigning Executive of
the Year. ``Last year was a special year, and I really felt like we
not only had the talent, but they were all playing up to or
exceeding their abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was set for this team to take it all the way. I
said last year, and I'll say it again: We may never have a better
opportunity than we had last year of going to a World Series. That
doesn't mean I don't think we're going to get to the World Series.
My point is, on paper, we may never have a better team assembled
than we did coming down the stretch last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won a franchise-record 102 games in 1998 and claimed
the National League Central title for the second year in a row.
They were bounced from the first round of the playoffs by San
Diego, against which Johnson was 0-2 with a 1.93 ERA and 17
strikeouts in two starts.
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson was tabbed as the man to lead the Astros to the
promised land, his job description didn't include anything about
performing miracles on their bats. The Astros produced only eight
runs in four games against the Padres _ just two in Johnson's two
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly was a disappointment that we didn't get to the
World Series, because in hindsight I still feel the team we had on
the field last year should have gotten to the World Series,''
Hunsicker said. ``But that's not the way sports works. This is a
great example of why you have to be careful when making trades in
the middle of the season, because in reality there's only one team
in the National League that gets to the World Series, and the odds
aren't great regardless of what moves you make.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly have to take that into consideration, because if
you continually live by the philosophy of `live for today and don't
worry about tomorrow,' you'll end up paying a heavy price.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be fortunate enough to get to the playoffs or maybe
win the World Series one year and then spend the next three or four
years trying to get out of last place, and that's not what I want
for this franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   It's highly unlikely the Astros will make a blockbuster deal
before Saturday's trading deadline, mainly because no one of
Johnson's caliber is available but partly because the farm system
has been thinned by recent deals.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Johnson trade seemed unlikely, too. Hunsicker
contacted Mariners GM Woody Woodward regarding Johnson several
months prior to the deadline but was told the Big Unit was not
available at that time.
</P>
<P>
   But as the deadline neared, the Mariners were aggressively
trying to deal Johnson, whom they no longer felt they would be able
to re-sign as a free agent. In the final days before the deadline,
Woodward's focus was on the Astros, Indians and Yankees, with the
Astros winning the sweepstakes because they were willing to include
two pitchers in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we gave up more than we wanted to, even for Randy
Johnson,'' Hunsicker said. ``You have to look at the complexity of
a transaction like this. Part of that is, What are the odds of
reaching the goal even if you make the deal, and what impact is
that going to have on the future _ on your ability to compete for
the next two or three years?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were willing to pay more for his services than anyone else,
and that's what it came down to. In reality, the Yankees or the
Indians could have acquired him if they wanted to. As it turned
out, he was of more value to us than he was to the Indians or the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until an hour before the deadline, I did not want to put
all three of those kids in the same deal, and I especially didn't
want to put two pitchers in there just because of how difficult it
is to acquire pitchers. We saw last year as a very special
situation, and that's very important to understand, because I don't
think that most years are like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although 1998 didn't end the way the Astros hoped, the Johnson
trade is one of the most significant transactions in franchise
history. Never before had they acquired such an impact player at
such a crucial time of the year, and not since Nolan Ryan had the
team employed a player with such celebrity appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to make a symbolic move, and I think the Randy
Johnson trade really sent a strong message to everyone, especially
our veteran players,'' Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said. ``It
showed that we are committed to winning. At the time, that was the
right move to make. Randy gave us a confidence that we never had
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We paid a big price in terms of the players we traded, and we
added $2 million in salary with Randy. I think the fans understand
that cost is a consideration, and we can't continue to do that year
after year. But trading for Randy was a remarkable situation, and
no trade in my seven years in baseball has ever come close to it. I
would absolutely do it again.''

<P>
   Canyoning has emerged as a trendy ``extreme'' sport, ranking
somewhere between bungee jumping and whitewater rafting in its
heart-thumping thrills and spills.
</P>
<P>
   Canyoning usually involves roping down into a river gorge, then
riding the fast whitewater by swimming, sliding or jumping from
rock to rock to the eventual safety of dry land. In Europe, the
protective uniform includes a helmet, neoprene wet suit and
slippers, life jacket and climbing harness.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where it is called canyoneering, the sport
is more laid back. For years hikers in southern Utah have been
roping down into narrow sandstone canyons and then walking, wading
and swimming out.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme aspects of the sport caught on a decade and a half
ago in Europe. It remains particularly popular in Switzerland,
Austria and France as an income-producing counterpart to
traditional winter sports.
</P>
<P>
   Canyoning has since taken root in Australia, Brazil, South
Africa and the Caribbean, where the growing popularity of adventure
lures tourists in search of something more exciting than the beach
or handicrafts market.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, a canyoning outfitter, Get Wet,
promises the excitement of ``really letting go, leaping, diving''
near the Jimenoa Falls, finishing up with a 50-foot waterfall
rappel and a 16-foot jump into the local lake to bask in ``a
certain standing applause from the many excursion holidaymakers who
visit here as part of their tourist schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil another outfitter, Grade VI, offers a canyoning course
that includes rappels off powerful waterfalls at Pinheirinho (116
feet) and Saltao (230 feet).
</P>
<P>
   The risks of such a sport are not limited to falls. The worst
danger is posed by flash floods that surge without warning through
narrow canyons with the force of water blasted from a fire hose.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, a flash flood killed 11 hikers in Lower Antelope
Canyon in northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1993, two adults with a Mormon youth group drowned after
they roped down into a 700-foot canyon in Zion National Park in
southern Utah and began working their way downstream; another adult
and five teen-agers were stranded on a ledge for four perilous
days. The party was unaware that floodgates had opened at the head
of the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Cheto Olais, the chief ranger at Zion, said that perhaps 10
percent of the park's 2.8 million visitors a year engage in
canyoneering. ``It's basically climbing, hiking, rappelling and
swimming in cold, cold water, because some of these slot canyons
never see the sun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most canyoneers at Zion, he said, were experienced enough not to
go out when there are thunderstorms to trigger flash floods. ``They
have to determine whether they want to pursue it or back off,''
Ranger Olais said. ``We try to provide a wilderness experience and
there's some inherent danger from Mother Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lee, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service, said it
only permitted canyoneering at Zion and Canyonlands National Parks
in southern Utah. Outward Bound, the National Outdoor Wilderness
Leadership School and other prominent outdoor-skills programs do
not teach canyoneering. Serious climbers and hikers tend to view
the sport, as practiced in Europe at least, as little more than a
stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Williamson, a former chief climbing instructor and program
director for Outward Bound, said extreme canyoneering comes with a
high ``C.T. factor,'' shorthand for cheap thrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a good idea and produces a lot of adrenaline
rush, but there are some consequences,'' said Williamson, who is
now the president of outdoor-oriented Sterling College in
Craftsbury, Vt.

REVOLUTION DEFENSE IS OPEN, REVOLVING DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Revolution have tried almost everything to restore
their central defense since dropping Alexi Lalas and Francis Okaroh
two years ago. Last year, the Revolution went through a dozen
pairings before being eliminated from playoff contention in August.
</P>
<P>
   This year, player-coach Walter Zenga seemed to have brought
stability to the team. But just when the Dan Calichman-Brian
Dunseth central combination should have been shifting into a gear
of competence and comprehension, Calichman was injured and Dunseth
benched.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Calichman (hip pointer) is questionable for the
Revolution's visit to Tampa Bay Saturday, leaving the team
vulnerable to a potentially explosive attack guided by Carlos
Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga will attempt to find a satisfactory combination among
Dunseth, Chaka Daley, and Mario Gori, who shared the central
defensive positions in Wednesday's training session. All three are
lacking either the experience or skill to command the position,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Dunseth could regain his starting role _ he had a 13-game
starting streak ended as the Revolution lost to D.C. United, 2-0,
Sunday. Daley, acquired from the Boston Bulldogs to replace Manny
Motajo, has performed as a reserve in one game. Gori, the most
accomplished and experienced of the three, is a left back.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga had hoped to have Joseph Addo, a Ghanaian whose
athleticism, experience, size, and skill would have solved the
problem. But either the league or the Revolution did not move
quickly enough to sign Addo, and instead the Revolution received
striker Ariel Graziani as an allocated player this week.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani was scheduled to receive a visa, then clear customs in
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, Wednesday. He will arrive in Tampa late
Thursday and be available for Saturday's match.
</P>
<P>
   But Graziani is a forward and will do little to bolster the
defense, which has surrendered at least two goals in six of the
last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do a better job defensively as a team,'' Dunseth
said. ``We need to communicate better, and we've addressed that on
the field. We need to work on doing the little things better, step
to the man quicker, work harder for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunseth has been impressed with Graziani after watching him play
for Veracruz and Morelia in Mexico and for Ecuador's national team.
``He can only help the team,'' Dunseth said. ``I've seen him in
Copa America and in the Mexican League, and he is a great player
with a nose for the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley had been playing the left side of defense in the Bulldogs'
3-5-2 sweeper alignment. But he grew up playing in the middle in
Toronto, Florida, and in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been as sharp as I want to be in practice,'' Daley
said. ``But your game gets tidier and sharper if you are involved
in real games. I just have to be patient and work hard and
practice, wait for my opportunity. Hopefully, I'll do well.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Addo met with Tampa Bay coaches and players Wednesday and will
attend Thursday's game against the Miami Fusion in Fort Lauderdale
and probably Saturday's match in Tampa. Addo could join the Mutiny
as early as next week.

DRUG COMPANY ADS ATTACK MEDICARE COVERAGE OF DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Flo,'' an arthritic Medicare beneficiary, made
her debut Wednesday in television commercials and newspaper
advertisements, cautioning Congress about potential pitfalls in its
effort to establish Medicare coverage for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, financed mainly by drug companies, do not
explicitly endorse or oppose President Clinton's proposal to offer
drug coverage to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. On the one
hand, Flo says Congress should ``help more seniors get prescription
drug coverage.'' On the other, she declares, ``I don't want big
government in my medicine cabinet!''
</P>
<P>
   Flo's message is thus less clear-cut than that of ``Harry and
Louise,'' the couple whose television commercials, financed by the
insurance industry, helped kill Clinton's plan to guarantee health
care for all Americans in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies sponsoring the current advertising campaign
want to be sure the government does not regulate drug prices or
decide which medicines will be available to the elderly or the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the advertisements says they were ``paid for by
Citizens for Better Medicare,'' a coalition that includes drug
manufacturers, large and small businesses and some patients'
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a
trade association for more than 100 drug companies, said it was
putting up most of the money, but refused to say how much. At a
board meeting two weeks ago, directors of the association discussed
plans for a $30 million advertising campaign, but the actual amount
will depend on the course of the debate over Medicare coverage of
prescription drugs in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements and commercials, which are appearing
nationally on cable television, show Flo in a bowling alley,
wearing a bright orange bowling jacket. While Medicare generally
does not cover outpatient drugs, Flo says she has drug benefits
through her ``retirement plan,'' and she notes that ``two-thirds of
America's seniors have prescription drug coverage'' already.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she asks, ``what about seniors who don't have
prescription drug coverage? Something ought to be done.'' In the
print advertisements, she urges readers, ``Let Congress know you
support the right Medicare reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Flo apparently shares the companies' concern that price controls
could choke off the revenue needed for pharmaceutical research.
``The right Medicare reforms,'' she says, will ``guarantee research
for tomorrow's cures.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, Citizens for Better Medicare, includes the
National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, the United Seniors Association and the National Kidney
Cancer Association.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the coalition, Timothy C. Ryan, said:
``We want more seniors to have drug coverage, but we want to do it
the right way. The choices seniors have today should not be
displaced by a one-size-fits-all, government-managed program.''
</P>
<P>
   From January 1998 until last Friday, Ryan said, he was
advertising director of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Martin A. Corry, director of federal affairs at the American
Association of Retired Persons, criticized the advertisements.
``This phony coalition, created and financed by the pharmaceutical
industry, is what we've come to expect from drug companies over the
last decade,'' Corry said. ``Fundamentally, they're in favor of the
status quo, which leaves millions of older Americans without drug
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are just the first phase of advertising by the
drug industry and its allies. After establishing her identity and
her personality, Flo will have more to say about specific
legislative proposals for Medicare drug benefits, an issue likely
to preoccupy Congress and political candidates next year.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements were produced for the coalition by Alex
Castellanos, a Republican media consultant, and his company,
National Media Inc. of Alexandria, Va. But Ryan said, ``We want the
coalition to be a bipartisan effort.''

PATRIOTS CUT WILLIE CLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With the Patriots trying to sign Ty Law to a contract
extension and all of their draft picks prior to the start of
training camp Friday, veteran free safety Willie Clay took the
salary cap hit and was released from the final year of his contract
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clay, a three-year starter at free safety who averaged 95
tackles and five interceptions per season, was due to earn $1.5
million this year. Patriots coach Pete Carroll said he had hoped
Clay would be the final cut he'd have to make among the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rookie signings will depend on whether the Patriots
could redo Law's contract. If not, another veteran may go, and
Shawn Jefferson could be next on the hit list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision, and after we went through the entire
roster, this is the move we decided to make. It's never easy, but
we hope we have some people who can compete for that position,''
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said competition for the free safety job was wide open
between rookie Tony George, three-year veteran Chris Carter, and
Larry Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   The news hit Clay hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got screwed,'' said Clay, who said he heard the news from
Carroll at mid-afternoon and then went to the team's Foxboro
offices to meet with Patriots vice president of player personnel
Bobby Grier. ``Being released is part of the business. I can live
with that, but the biggest thing was the timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a family and this is my livelihood. I feel they didn't
show me any respect by doing it this late. The Arizona Cardinals
cut Larry Centers a month ago, and he was able to hook on with
another team and get into another program. I have to believe they
knew they were going to do this awhile ago. After they signed their
draft picks, they knew they needed money. They said it was a salary
cap move, but they never even came to me to say they wanted to
renegotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to treat people who have been good to your
organization, and I was that. I never missed a day of practice, I
played all the time. I was always prepared and I was a
professional. I spent all off-season in the workout program and I
could have been home with my son if I'd known this was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay, who was considered a leader of the Patriots' defense,
doesn't understand the loyalty shown to some and not to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped groom some guys and they'll be the first one to tell
you that,'' said Clay. ``I've been here through good times and bad
times here and I thought we had a defense that was ready to really
jell after being together the last three years. I took hits for the
coaches and for the team and I was never fully appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay said he was accused of not having a good first half of the
season because he wound having to ``babysit'' the right corner
spot, where Chris Canty was lost during his stint as starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never complained about it. I just dealt with it,'' said
Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said that while Clay's leadership would be felt, the
coach thought it was time for Milloy to take over that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be the leader of our secondary. He's ready. We believe
it's time for him to take that,'' said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were continuing to try and hash out a deal for free
agent Terry Allen, as they have been for months. The Patriots will
also look at the waiver wire to see if another running back becomes
available.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have been rejected by agent Jack Bechta on the
reworking of Todd Rucci's contract. The Patriots were trying to
work down the 5-year, $10 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While bidding adieu to Clay, the Patriots welcomed three draft
choices onto the payroll, signing second-rounder Kevin Faulk, a
running back from Louisiana State, to an estimated five-year deal
worth $3 million with a $1.2m signing bonus; third-rounder Tony
George, a safety from Florida, to a 3-year, $1.09 million deal with
a $340,000 bonus; and fifth-rounder Derrick Fletcher, an offensive
lineman from Baylor, who received $84,000 to sign and salaries of
$175,000, $250,000, and $325,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots now have signed six of their eight draft picks, and
their training camp roster totals 85. Their two first-round
selections _ Boston College center Damien Woody and Ohio State
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer _ have not agreed to terms.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Nine men know what happened inside a 7-by-9-foot cell in
Florida State Prison on the morning of June 19, when prison guards
armed with stun guns arrived to forcibly extract Frank Valdez, a
death-row inmate who murdered a corrections officer 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez, his body marked with bruises in the shape of boot prints
and his ribs broken, was beaten to death, state investigators said.
The nine, all corrections officers who the investigators said
either witnessed, knew about or took part in the beating, are not
talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have classified this as a homicide,'' said Elizabeth Hirst,
a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which
investigates suspicious deaths in the state prison system. ``We
don't know exactly how many people took part in the killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdez was, according to prison and criminal records, one of the
most violent residents of what is called the X-wing _ a long
corridor lined with tiny cells that dead-ends at the state's
execution chamber _ in the maximum security prison in Starke, in
northern Florida. It only houses murderers like Valdez, 36, who are
moved from place to place in chains.
</P>
<P>
   But the violent nature of Valdez's own death, and the refusal by
the prison guards to cooperate with the investigation, has prompted
the FBI to join a state investigation that widened this week to
include complaints of brutality in prisons throughout the system.
</P>
<P>
   The homicide investigation has not led to criminal charges so
far but has resulted in suspensions _ with pay _ of the nine prison
guards and two other corrections officers who have refused to
cooperate with investigators. The investigation has been stymied by
that silence, said state investigators _ 12 of them in all _ who
are working from a command post set up outside the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 guards suspended, nine are believed to be directly
involved, said C.J. Drake, director of public affairs for the
Florida Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' Drake said, ``this appears to be an isolated
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucia Ross, the press secretary to Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida,
said Wednesday that ``it's a little premature to come to any
conclusions that there's any widespread problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the killing has lent credibility to a drumbeat of complaints
by inmates of brutalities in Florida's 53-prison system. Those
complaints _ usually in the form of unsolicited letters to the
courts, reporters and lawyers _ are often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   One letter, from a prisoner on X-wing received by The Miami
Herald on July 15, two days before Valdez was killed, was eerily
similar to the picture investigators paint of his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sounds of prisoners screaming in pain and of bodies being
beaten keeps the inmates on the entire wing up all night,'' wrote
Mike Lambrix, a convicted murderer in X-wing, in a letter dated
July 6. ``I can hear the officers forcibly take inmates from their
cells. The wretched sound of fists and boots striking flesh are
unmistakable as is the sound of some kind of weapon (a stick or a
broom handle?) being used. They scream. They whimper. Then there is
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to get the feds in here,'' he continued, ``to
stop this before someone gets killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hirst said investigators are now looking at other such
complaints that were made both before and after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just caution you that there's two sides to every
story,'' Drake said. ``The Valdez incident has created an
atmosphere in which prisoners feel they can rehash a lot of
allegations against the prison system.'' In many cases, he added,
``we did investigate them and found that they are without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Rubin, a lawyer who is representing the Valdez family,
said the family wants the federal authorities to take over the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Florida investigating itself is like the fox
guarding the chicken coop,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators will be following up on those complaints
as part of the broader investigation, Florida officials said,
leaving state investigators free to concentrate on the homicide. A
few inmates from X-wing who may have seen or heard the attack have
been moved to another part of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, state prison officials announced that they would
videotape the removal of violent inmates from their cells _ what
the officials term ``extractions''_ to avoid speculation about what
actually happens, Drake said. State officials have been considering
the taping for some time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valdez incident merely accelerated our decision,'' Drake
said. ``But I wouldn't take it as a sign that we have a lack of
confidence in our prison guards.''
</P>
<P>
   If such a system had been in place, it would have shown what
happened that morning to Valdez, who has been in and out of prison
since 1980 for violently resisting a police officer, burglary,
robbery, kidnapping and grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, while trying to help another prisoner escape from
Glades Correctional Institution, Valdez shot to death Fred Griffis,
a corrections officer. A Palm Beach County Circuit Court sentenced
him to die.
</P>
<P>
   His death warrant had not yet been signed by Bush when the
extraction team of five officers, along with other officers, came
to remove him so they could search for weapons or other contraband.
Prison officials said the search was triggered when he had
threatened to kill a guard.
</P>
<P>
   The guards, armed with stun guns, fought with Valdez, who was,
from the results of a medical examination, struck and kicked
several times, investigators said. He was then placed in a cell,
without medical attention for several hours, and pronounced dead
later that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The corrections officers' union has said the men were just doing
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The officers suspended in the incident are Capt. Timothy Alvin
Thornton, 33; Sgt. Montrez Lazort Lucas, 30; Sgt. Charles Austin
Brown, 25; Sgt. Andrew William Lewis, 28; Sgt. Jason Patrick
Griffis, 26; Sgt. Robert William Sauls, and officers Dewey Marce
Beck, 51, Donald Michael Stanford, 51, and Raymon C. Hanson. The
two officers suspended this week were Daren Patgett, 34, and Philip
Maddox, 26. Griffis is no relation to the slain guard.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently handed the prison system over to Michael Moore,
who had a reputation as a tough jailer as head of the South
Carolina prison system. Moore ordered a review in January of the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
   Prison watchdog groups have lashed out at the Florida prison
system after the death. No matter how violent Valdez was, they say,
it was wrong to mirror his actions with even greater violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brutality and violence are not a legitimate response to
criminal conduct,'' said Jamie Fellner, associate counsel for Human
Rights Watch, based in New York. ``You can't fight crime with
crime.''

 &HT;    Attorney for O'Dwyer denies assault charge
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The attorney for Bengals guard Matt O'Dwyer
fought back on Wednesday, saying that allegations of assault
against his client are false.
</P>
<P>
   New York attorney William Zaccaria said all charges against
O'Dwyer, stemming from a July 10 brawl at a Long Beach, N.Y. bar,
should be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer faces a $3.825 million civil suit from three police
officers who allege he injured their eyes during a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit against O'Dwyer was filed in New York Supreme
Court, Nassau County, on Monday _ the same day of his scheduled
pretrial hearing, which was postponed until Aug. 16 in Long Beach
City Court.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer, 26, is charged with disorderly conduct, second-degree
harassment, two felony counts of second-degree assault and a
fourth-degree charge of criminal mischief. He was released from
jail on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer, who signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract with the
Bengals on June 22, is due to report to the team's training camp on
Friday at Georgetown (Ky.) College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my client's position _ it always has been _ that he
didn't commit any crimes of any nature,'' Zaccaria said. ``That the
charges against him are not properly brought, that they should be
dismissed, and he certainly is not guilty of anything charged in
any lawsuit since he didn't do anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaccaria said he hasn't seen a copy of the civil complaint
against O'Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there are any charges alleging an assault or personal
injury, he accepts none of the responsibility for that and it'll
come out in the end that he shouldn't have been arrested to begin
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Island attorney Lawrence Elovich, who filed the civil suit
against O'Dwyer and New York Jets tackle John ``Jumbo'' Elliott on
behalf of three police officers and two other bar patrons, said the
football players ``engaged in a raucous brawl, fighting and pushing
patrons and throwing items throughout the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Elovich said O'Dwyer ``kicked out the right rear window of the
police car,'' with flying glass ``cutting and embedding the face
and eyes of police officers John O'Sullivan, Dean Burke and Anthony
Rivelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Dwyer was intoxicated, out of control and refused to go
peaceably into the police car for which he would have been arrested
just for disorderly conduct,'' Elovich said. ``Instead, he lost
control and went wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The police) used a stun gun with 50,000 volts of electricity,
which didn't even knock him down or move him. He told the police
officers: 'Is that all you got?' They finally had to use a pepper
spray on him, which was finally able to subdue him.''

CRUISE LINE SAYS IT UNDERREPORTED ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Carnival Cruise Lines said on Wednesday there
were 108 allegations that crew members were involved in sexual
assaults and sexual misconduct aboard its ships in a five-year
period that ended last August, not 62 incidents as reported by the
company two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the increase of more than 70 percent reflected
a more thorough search of its records. It also provided the first
case-by-case breakdown of the allegations, which included 16
reports that passengers were raped by crew members and 6 cases in
which crew members claimed they were raped by fellow workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These figures alone should tell you that Carnival ships
provided one of the safest vacation environments anywhere in the
world,'' said Curtis J. Mase, a lawyer for the company, which
carried 6.5 million passengers during the period.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the cruise industry has taken several steps to
defuse concern over crimes on board ships. The trade group for the
largest passenger lines serving ports in the United States, which
includes Carnival, said its members had adopted a ``zero
tolerance'' policy for crimes. Under the first industrywide
standard, all allegations of crime will be reported to the FBI or
other appropriate law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, some victims had complained that they were pressured
not to report crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of allegations disclosed by Carnival to news
organizations on Wednesday was sharply higher, company officials
said most cases were less serious than indicated earlier. The
majority involved allegations of unwanted touching, kissing and
other inappropriate advances, according to Carnival's compilation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in what were described as minor incidents, the company said
that crew members were fired for violating its policy against
fraternizing with passengers or for being in unauthorized parts of
the ship. In all, 47 crew members were fired in the five-year
period, according to Carnival's records.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, a cabin steward on the ship Celebration lost his
job in May 1997 after a passenger complained of an unwanted kiss.
The company report said its investigation was unable to verify the
claim, but the employee was dismissed for violating company
policies on fraternizing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Carnival produced the initial statistics in connection with a
lawsuit in Miami against the company by a former employee who said
she was raped and sodomized by an officer aboard a ship last Aug.
13. The company provided the compilation after being ordered to do
so by a Miami-Dade County judge and a state appellate court. The
company said it would provide the new statistics to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Mase said the new statistics resulted from a better search,
which included examining complaints from passengers after cruises.
Some of those complaints were made weeks or months after the
alleged incidents, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   In the instance that resulted in the suit by the crew member,
the company said its investigation found that the relationship
between the two employees was consensual, something the crew member
has denied.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Miami indicted the alleged assailant on
charges of aggravated sexual assault.

VOTE-BUYING ALLEGATIONS SWIRL AROUND IOWA STRAW POLL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The credibility of next month's Iowa straw poll of
Republican presidential candidates was thrown into turmoil
Wednesday when the head of the state's Christian Coalition traded
charges with the Steve Forbes campaign about allegations of
vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
   In a charge that stunned the presidential field, Iowa Christian
Coalition chairman Bobbie Lee Gobel alleged that a Forbes aide
tried to hire 500 people from her temporary-worker company in an
effort to win next month's straw poll. The Forbes campaign strongly
denied the allegation, saying it was ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegation could not be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   But with little more than two weeks before the Aug. 14 vote in
Ames, Iowa, the accusation highlighted the way campaigns sometimes
cover the costs for supporters who go to the straw poll. Most
campaigns openly admit they pay the $25 entrance fee and
transportation expenses, but they deny they are ``paying'' for
votes. The poll is variously viewed as politically meaningless or
as an important test of organizational strength in the state that
holds the first caucus of the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel, the owner of Metro Temp in Des Moines, is one of the most
sought-after political figures in Iowa. Although the Christian
Coalition doesn't endorse candidates, individual leaders of the
organization often do. As a result, many presidential candidates
have courted Gobel, hoping she could persuade the state's
influential anti-abortion community to follow her to the polls.
Gobel said she has not endorsed any candidate, but she has met
several of them. For example, on Gobel's birthday, Elizabeth Dole
took Gobel and her family to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Gobel said a senior Forbes aide called
her in February and sought to hire 500 people from her firm who
would vote for Forbes in the straw poll. She said the call came
from Jerry Keen, the former chairman of the Georgia Christian
Coalition who now is a top Forbes aide.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel said Keen inquired about hiring 500 ``temps'' who would be
paid for four hours of work, during which they would vote for
Forbes at the straw poll. Gobel said she took down the order but
never processed it. She said she discussed it with the Iowa board
of the Iowa Christian Coalition and concluded such an act would be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to hire temps to go and vote for Steve Forbes,''
Gobel said.
</P>
<P>
   But Keen adamantly denied the allegation, saying he did talk to
Gobel in February and on several occasions, but he never said
anything about hiring temporary workers to vote for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely, unequivocally false,'' Keen said. He said
Gobel was upset with the Forbes campaign because it had hired the
executive director of the Iowa Christian Coalition, who still has
not been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel indicated that she is not a fan of Forbes by noting that,
despite his own vehement opposition to abortion, he served as
co-chairman for the campaign of New Jersey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman, who supports abortion rights. ``He co-chaired Christie
Todd Whitman, the mother of all the baby-killers,'' Gobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Gobel said she is looking for ``a Godly candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' political director, Bill Dal Col, said the campaign
never approached Gobel or anyone else about hiring temporary
workers to vote for the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never happened,'' Dal Col said. ``She is embarrassing
herself and her organization. We are building a grass-roots
organization for a candidate who favors tax cuts and is pro-life.
We are not paying anyone to go to a straw vote.'' Dal Col said the
campaign is only paying for the $25 tickets and transportation
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ione Dilley, the former chairman of the Iowa Christian Coalition
who appointed Gobel to the post last November, said Gobel mentioned
the allegations to her several months ago. But Dilley said she did
not have any first-hand knowledge about whether they were true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down to one person's word against the other,'' Dilley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa Republican Party,
said Gobel is a ``credible person who is relatively new to Iowa,''
although he stressed he could not verify Gobel's allegations. He
said the Christian Coalition is ``a very powerful force in Iowa
politics and . . . growing. Bobbie is a good organizer within the
conservative Christian community, and that is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he still thinks the straw poll is ``very credible''
since only Iowans can vote, unlike in 1995 when people from across
the country were able to participate.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 Iowans are expected to vote in the straw poll.
While the vote is meaningless in the actual race for delegates to
the national Republican convention next year, it has turned into a
powerful political draw as numerous candidates have said their
performance in Ames is a crucial test.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, who has raised $37 million in
campaign funds this year, and Forbes, who is using his own fortune
to match Bush, are spending heavily in the Iowa contest. Forbes,
for example, just launched a $10 million advertising campaign,
concentrating heavily on Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Lamar Alexander has only $90,000 cash on hand and
could be forced to drop out of the race if he does poorly in the
straw poll. Wednesday, Alexander spent some of his money on an Iowa
television ad that targets Bush, with a mock newscast suggesting
that the presidency is being auctioned to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bush tried to get around campaign spending
limits by having friends pay $50,000 directly to the Iowa
Republican Party for tickets to the straw poll, plus $43,000 to
rent a prominent patch of lawn outside the convention hall where
the straw vote is taking place. After much criticism, Bush agreed
to pay for both expenditures from his campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later announced he would not take matching federal campaign
funds, which means he doesn't have to abide by the $1.3 million
spending limit in Iowa. Forbes also is rejecting federal matching
funds and spending freely.

A JUDGE WHO GAVELED THE UNITED STATES INTO IMPROVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second-best thing that Dwight D. Eisenhower did as president
was to appoint Frank M. Johnson Jr. as federal district judge for
middle Alabama in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   A close second.
</P>
<P>
   Like Earl Warren, whose nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court
topped all else that Eisenhower did in the White House, Johnson
made and participated in decisions that changed America irrevocably
for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Some would even say that the Alabama jurist contributed more to
extend civil rights protections to all Americans than did Warren,
who headed the Supreme Court that rendered the historic 1954 ruling
of Brown vs. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   In support of that assessment, they would cite Johnson's:
</P>
<P>
   Voting with the majority in 1995 when a three-judge panel found
that the law requiring segregation on city buses in Montgomery,
Ala., was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   1961 order prohibiting bogus tests used to prevent blacks from
registering to vote in Alabama. Johnson ruled that any black whose
qualifications equalled those of the ``least qualified white'' must
be allowed to vote. A year later, he eliminated the poll tax in
Alabama and joined two other judges in ordering that
reapportionment for voting in that state be based on population.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the 1965 civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery to
proceed under protection of the federalized Alabama National Guard
after the marchers had been brutally attacked by state police on
the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing the killers of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo to 10
years in prison for violating Liuzzo's civil rights. A Lowndes
County jury has previously acquitted the three Ku Klux Klansmen of
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Those are among the most noted of the many rulings that Johnson
made or shared during the 1950s, '60s and '70s that helped consign
racial segregation to the dustbin of history _ rulings that
provided equal access to government facilities and places of public
accommodation, advanced the cause of fairness and equity before the
law, and allowed black Americans to exercise the most fundamental
privileges of citizenship in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   For doing those things, Johnson, who died last week, received
considerable overdue recognition in his later years. Three
noteworthy biographies chronicle his life, including one by Robert
F. Kennedy Jr. In 1993, Johnson became the first recipient of the
American Bar Association's Thurgood Marshall Award, which honors
someone who ``most exemplifies Justice Marshall's spirit on behalf
of protecting civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But during his years on the federal bench in Montgomery, Johnson
was subject to threats of violence, verbal vilification and much
social ostracism. His mother's house was bombed, and crosses were
burned on his lawn. It became necessary for federal marshals to
protect Johnson and his family.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the hate mail and insults from anonymous people,
Johnson had to endure much vitriol from prominent people, including
the then-governor of Alabama, George Wallace. The champion of
segregation ``today, tomorrow and forever'' accused Johnson of
usurping the governorship and called the federal judge an
``integratin', carpetbaggin', scalawaggin', baldfaced liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Branded a judicial activist by enemies such as Wallace, Johnson
said that as both a trial judge and an appellate judge on the Fifth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, he had endeavored to ``follow the
law and the facts without regard to the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's pursuit of the law and the facts led to a better and
freer America. And for that, all Americans owe the Lincolnesque man
from Haleyville, Ala. _ big-time.
</P>
<P>
   He was a champion of justice at a crucial time for justice in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. said more than once that ``the universe
is on the side of justice.'' In that case, the universe (''God''
may be used synonymously here) provides the means to allow justice
to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   It was not by accident that Eisenhower appointed Frank M.
Johnson Jr. at a time when this nation's capacity for doing justice
and loving mercy was being severely tested.

TAKING STOCK OF BRUTON SMITH'S DRAG-RACING PLANS AT TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A short list of possible motives, altruistic and ulterior, have
surfaced in the week since motorsports developer Bruton Smith
announced plans to build the finest drag strip on the planet at
Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Let's review some of the theories: Smith's decision to go drag
racing is altruistic. He really and truly wants to take the
National Hot Rod Association to the next level with improved
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Smith already has begun delivering with his revamped Bristol
(Tenn.) Dragway, a project that cost Speedway Motorsports Inc. $14
million. Similar price tags have been placed upon the quarter-mile
drag strip under construction at Smith's Las Vegas Motor Speedway,
which has landed a national event weekend on the NHRA schedule in
April 2000, and for the projected facility at TMS in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Smith plans to build corporate suites down the quarter-mile, the
type of innovation that could convince corporate sponsors _ and
live TV _ to give drag racing another shot. Smith's decision to go
drag racing is designed to stick it to Billy Meyer and his plan to
relocate the Texas Motorplex from Ennis to Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, a former Funny Car driver from Waco, is attempting to
complete a master plan and financing with Grand Prairie officials
that would allow him to build a $74 million facility (including
real estate costs) on 500 acres. The Grand Prairie City Council has
discussed a November referendum on a sales tax that would help pay
for the facility.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith can sideswipe the Grand Prairie project and keep Meyer
in Ennis, he stands to improve his chance of trying to entice the
NHRA out of its 15-year exclusivity contract for national events
with Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Smith and Meyer also have a short and nasty history.
It dates to Meyer's announcement in November 1994 that he planned
to build a superspeedway at Pinnacle Park in Dallas _ one day
before Smith and his group announced plans for their project here.
</P>
<P>
   Smith easily won the superspeedway war, and he and Meyer since
have operated under an uneasy truce. But Smith and Eddie Gossage,
TMS' executive vice president and general manager, have taken a
cavalier attitude toward Meyer's Grand Prairie project and his
contract with the NHRA.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has a long memory for those who cross him, and the timing
of Smith's announcement smacks of payback. Smith's decision to go
drag racing is an indication that, despite his public posturing, he
genuinely is worried about landing a second NASCAR Winston Cup date
for TMS. Drag racing potentially offers him another way to ``feed
the monster.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, International Speedway Corp. completed its merger
with Penske Motorsports Inc., a deal announced May 10. The merger
has placed 10 racetracks under the banner of International Speedway
chairman and chief executive Bill France Jr., who also is president
of NASCAR and thus controls Cup race dates.
</P>
<P>
   International Speedway Corp. also is ``developing'' oval tracks
in Kansas City, Chicago, New York and Denver. That is tantamount to
saying each facility will land its first Cup dates before Smith's
tracks in Fort Worth and Las Vegas _ and even International
Speedway's California Speedway _ are granted second dates.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also promises International Speedway Corp. a bigger
chunk of NASCAR's impending consolidated TV package.
</P>
<P>
   If those moves have relegated Smith's Speedway Motorsports Inc.
to a secondary role in NASCARland, perhaps Smith feels that NHRA
drag racing will allow him to rule an alternative empire and keep
his stockholders smiling, whatever the motives.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON: SHARP AIMING TO TAME DOVER'S `MONSTER MILE'
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR driver Sterling Marlin has likened racing a Winston Cup
stock car on the high-banked, all-concrete, half-mile Bristol
(Tenn.) Motor Speedway to flying a jet plane in a gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   That analogy also fits this weekend's stop on the Pep Boys Indy
Racing League schedule. The IRL's open-wheeled cars will spend
Sunday afternoon whipping around the one-mile, high-banked,
all-concrete surface of Dover Downs International Speedway in
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sharp emerged as winner of the IRL's inaugural visit to
the ``Monster Mile,'' its bumpy surface and 24-degree banked turns
last summer. Sharp finished 0.689 seconds ahead of Buddy Lazier in
a race that routinely produced laps run at 183-plus mph with zero
margin for error. The tight confines also resulted in seven caution
periods that consumed 99 of 248 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like a real-life video game for me _ 19-second
laps that feel like 10 seconds,'' Sharp said. ``It's one of the
biggest survival races on our schedule. You've got to have your
wits about you to go for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp scored his first victory of 1999 on the 1.5-mile Atlanta
Motor Speedway quad-oval on July 17. That track also is banked at
24 degrees, but its longer length, wider corners and smoother
surface distinguish it from Dover Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the toughest place we go to,'' said Sharp, who has taken
some comfort in the fact the race has been reduced to 200 laps.
``It's incredibly rough and incredibly bumpy. Until you get it (the
chassis) working on the bumps, you can't even read your dash.
That's pretty wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, last year's pole-sitter, can attest to how wild.
Stewart was pulling out a healthy lead, until his car's dash
vibrated loose and dropped into his lap. He was forced to pit four
times before the crew could tape the dash back into place. Stewart
finished eighth, 28 laps behind Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bumpy as it is, it's another challenge,'' said Sharp, 31.
``Nobody in the IRL wants to go to the same kind of racetracks all
the time. Dover is very unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's victory at Atlanta vaulted him from a tie for fifth into
second in the points chase, 21 behind Scott Goodyear with four
races remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of points on the table. What I'm excited about
is our pace,'' said Sharp, who shared the 1996 IRL championship
with Buzz Calkins. ``The whole team is pretty pumped up at the
moment. We have that confidence the car is going to roll off the
truck pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS TMS SURVEYS OPTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Motorsports Inc. engineers are studying the landscape
on the east and west sides of Texas Motor Speedway as possible
sites for the track's new drag strip.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, TMS' executive vice president and general
manager, said the west side of the speedway, where the front
entrances are located, has paved parking that could double as a pit
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's not a lot of utility service there,'' Gossage
said.
</P>
<P>
   The east side of the property is better serviced by utilities,
but would have the strip and its grandstands fronting Interstate
35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aesthetically, do we want it located between I-35 and the
oval-track? Is that the view you want to present?'' Gossage said.
``The engineers have got to come up with the most cost-effective
locale. And maybe neither of those are the place to be.'' BAD DASH
FOR `MAD MAX'
</P>
<P>
   Max Papis' heartbreaking last-lap, out-of-fuel loss to Tony
Kanaan in CART's U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway on Sunday has been
traced to a telemetry glitch in the car's dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telemetry went out when Max left the pit lane,'' said Tom
Cindric, Team Rahal's team manager. ``If the telemetry freezes up,
the fuel system goes to full rich, or 100 percent. Max tried to
lean out the fuel in the cockpit, but the system was already set at
that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Papis reportedly fell approximately 12 ounces of methanol fuel
short of his first Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series
victory. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Native Texan and two-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion Terry
Labonte, 42, has agreed on a three-year contract with Hendrick
Motorsports. Winner of the Primestar 500 at Texas Motor Speedway in
March, Labonte has driven for Rick Hendrick since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   _ Funny Car driver Ron Capps plans to debut a Victory-built
chassis under his Copenhagen Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 during the
NHRA's Prolong Northwest Nationals at Seattle International Raceway
this weekend. The defending race champion, Capps is winless through
12 events.

TCU WOMEN'S BASKETBALL COACH LEAVES TO JOIN GOPHERS' STAFF
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN'S COACH-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Coach Mike Petersen led the TCU women's
basketball team to its first winning season in Division I, to its
first postseason victory and to its first vote in the women's poll.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after three seasons, he's leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen resigned Wednesday to become an assistant men's
basketball coach at Minnesota. The position was offered after the
Golden Gophers hired Dan Monson to replace Clem Haskins earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard decision,'' Petersen said. ``In three years, we
have taken TCU from ground zero to where it's on the verge of
making national noise and being nationally recognized. When you
spend the kind of time and make the kind of effort we have, to
decide not be here to enjoy the fruits is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU athletic director Eric Hyman said a national search already
has begun to find a replacement. He said he didn't have a specific
timetable for bringing in a new coach, but would like to have
someone hired ``as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of candidates is led by Horned Frogs assistant coach
Art Prevost, who was on Petersen's original staff. Beyond Prevost,
Hyman said that he had yet to assemble any names.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like a direction a program is going, you owe it to
yourself to look from within,'' Hyman said. ``I told Mike the
institution is indebted to his accomplishments because what he has
done makes it a much more attractive position.''
</P>
<P>
   When Petersen came to TCU in 1996, the Horned Frogs had won
three games in the previous two seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
   TCU finished 13-14 in its first season under Petersen, 13-15 in
his second and 16-12 last season, earning the Frogs a berth in the
Western Athletic Conference Tournament. They defeated UT-El Paso,
67-58, in the first round for the program's first postseason
victory before losing to New Mexico in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen brought his players to campus Wednesday to break the
news. It was, by all accounts, a teary scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are blown away right now,'' TCU guard Amy Sutton said. ``We
had no clue why they had called us to come down today. Our whole
team, it seemed like from the response, was devastated and hurt.
... Even though he's leaving, he left a family behind. He didn't
score any of the points or any of the baskets. We did, and we're
still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen said the direction the program was heading and his
relationship with the players made it difficult to leave, but his
long-standing friendship with Monson made it difficult to say no.
</P>
<P>
   The two have known each other for more than 15 years. Petersen
will be the best man in Monson's wedding next weekend. Petersen
also served as a men's assistant coach under Monson's father, Don,
at Oregon from 1989-1992.
</P>
<P>
   Monson also brought in another close friend, Bill Walker, an
assistant coach at Central Missouri State, to be an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to have coaches on my staff who know me and my style of
basketball,'' Monson said. ``Mike and Dan both fit this
description. They are excellent coaches, very good friends and they
bring a wealth and variety of experience to the position.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Petersen: ``We've been talking about being on the same
staff together for as long as we've known each other. It's a
tremendous opportunity for me professionally.'' nn

 &HT;    Sanders: `It felt like it was time'
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Sanders, almost certain to become the NFL's career rushing
leader this season, abruptly retired from football on Wednesday and
took flight to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, only 1,458 yards short of breaking former Chicago Bears
running back Walter Payton's record of 16,726, said his reason for
quitting was simple: He's lost interest in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders, 31, also apparently was discouraged by the Detroit
Lions' failure to build a competitive team, and his relationship
with third-year coach Bobby Ross had soured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I am retiring is very simple,'' Sanders said in a
statement. ``My desire to exit the game is greater than my desire
to remain in it. I have searched my heart through and through and
feel comfortable with this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders arrived in London on Wednesday after a three-hour
delayed, overnight flight from Detroit. Reached by The Associated
Press at Gatwick Airport, Sanders said he planned on staying in
London for several days, and then would travel to Paris or
Amsterdam. Sanders said he'd return home in ``about two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years is a lot of football,'' Sanders said. ``I'm just
really not feeling like playing. It's just getting to that point.
It's not the same game. Really, I've been battling for the last few
years. As I've gotten older, the game has changed in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thinking about doing other things. It's still fun,
but not as fun. It just felt like it was time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would change his mind, Sanders shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's going to happen,'' he said. ``I'm not
really thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   David Ware of Atlanta, one of two agents who represents Sanders,
said he told Lions executive vice president Chuck Schmidt of his
client's intentions late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after last season ended, I think he really began to
seriously consider retiring and contemplated what he should do,''
Ware said. ``I really think it took him this long to decide. He's
absolutely sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ware said he attempted to change Sanders' mind, but the 1988
Heisman Trophy winner from Oklahoma State wouldn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that the (NFL career rushing) record was
motivation for him,'' Ware said. ``He's just not that type of
player or person. . . . I have to take him for his word. He said
that mentally he wasn't prepared to play another season. I don't
think he wanted to cheat the fans, so he thought it was better not
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, the former Georgia Tech and San Diego Chargers coach known
for his fiery temperament, said that he made at least 10 telephone
calls to Sanders, and had written him three or four letters in the
offseason, but Sanders never responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal feeling is that we're looking at a situation where
the man got tired of playing the game,'' Ross said. ``Do I feel
that Barry left because of me? No, I don't feel that way at all.
This isn't about me; it's about Barry.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement stunned many in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he retires, it will be a waste of talent,'' said Atlanta
Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle. ``I think the guy can play two or
three more years at that level. It would be a lot of wasted
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Falcons coach Dan Reeves: ``He's been an awesome player. I
don't know that anybody's been as big for their team as Barry's
been for his. There's a lot of guys that you can name, but he's
been awesome. Whenever you have a player that's that good for his
team, he's also great for the league. If the guy is sincere and he
hangs it up, you're going to miss a great running back that's one
of the best of all-time, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This season would have been Sanders' third in a six-year, $36
million contract, which included an $11 million signing bonus. The
Lions have the right to demand back a pro-rated portion, which is
$5.4 million, according to Ware. If Sanders decides to return to
the NFL, he would still be obligated to fulfill the final four
years of his contract with the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' retirement gives Detroit $3.3 million in salary-cap
room. If Detroit traded him to another team, Sanders would still
count $2.1 million against the Lions' salary cap, meaning they'd
probably have to waive four or five players or restructure several
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which had the NFL's 14th-ranked offense last season,
will probably turn to fourth-round pick Sedrick Irvin, who rushed
for 1,167 yards at Michigan State last season. The Lions also have
five-year veteran Ron Rivers, who rushed for 102 yards on only 19
carries in 1998.

GORE BIDS TO IMPRESS VOTERS WITH PUBLIC POLICY POSITIONS

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore believes he has a potent
weapon in the presidential race _ his knowledge of public policy
issues. He has staked out positions on scores of topics and
suggests that his opponents, both Democratic and Republican, have
been vague and therefore undeserving.
</P>
<P>
   On everything from education to crime to cancer research, Gore
has weighed in: preschool for all children, a ban on gang-style
clothing, photo licenses for anyone who buys a handgun and a
doubling of financing for cancer research over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to ``keep the prosperity going'' and to create more
time for families to spend together. He wants to end trade barriers
and outlaw any tax on sales made over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He warns about the ``digital divide,'' in which blacks and
Hispanics have less access to computers than whites, a disparity
that he says undermines job training and threatens America's
ability to remain the world's economic superpower. Chiefly, he
says, he wants to give the country a moral transfusion, making it
``not only better off, but better.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore is planning to offer more specifics, this time
on tax cuts. He is to propose his own version of tax cuts for the
middle class, aides say. Wednesday, he bashed Republicans for
proposing to spend most of the budget surplus on a ``risky'' tax
cut without first shoring up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The blizzard of positions is the essence of the
Gore-for-president campaign, designed to show voters that the vice
president has ideas and experience and, by contrast, to suggest
that his opponents do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm campaigning this way because I believe that campaigns
ought to be based on ideas, and I think voters have a right to know
exactly what a candidate for president is proposing to do as
president,'' Gore said in an interview. ``Our democracy is
ill-served by an over-reliance on generalities and fuzzy rhetoric
and is much better served by specific, detailed discussions of the
tough choices we have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers say they have been disappointed about media
attention on his political problems despite his focus on issues,
although a recent poll by the Dallas Morning News suggests that
voters at this point seem to put little stock in issues.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that even though most Americans admit they know
little about Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front
runner, they strongly favor him over Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But since mid-May, Gore has delivered four speeches that his
aides call major policy addresses, covering education, crime,
faith-based organizations and cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gore's positions follow routes laid out by President
Clinton, such as insisting on a balanced budget. Some bump up
against Democratic orthodoxy, such as his advocacy of teacher
testing. But perhaps the most striking thing about his positions is
the sheer volume of them, especially so early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore becomes almost indignant when asked if his avalanche of
positions might be overwhelming voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say, `You're giving too many details, you're
offering too many specifics,' my response is, `Too many compared to
what?''' he said. ``Compared to nothing? And how did we get in a
situation where it's considered odd to offer a detailed set of
policy proposals for the challenges we face?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who last year floated and then abandoned the slogan of
``practical idealism,'' has yet to adopt another that melds his
various proposals into an overarching theme.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he stands for, he offered the following: ``Keep the
prosperity going, make certain no one's left behind, bring
revolutionary improvement to our public schools, build stronger
families and more liveable communities.''
</P>
<P>
   He generally stays away from emotional and ideological causes,
although he supports abortion rights and the death penalty and has
endorsed affirmative action programs. In a visit to Washington
state this month, he denounced a ballot initiative, passed by the
state's voters in 1998, that struck down affirmative action
programs in hiring by public agencies and admissions to state
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   By de-emphasizing such matters, and by supporting Republican
ideas like federal money for churches to help fight social ills,
Gore is placing himself squarely in the school of ``New Democrats''
that Clinton pioneered so effectively.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has already carved out that territory, leaving his
vice president to cast about for self-definition that does not seem
derivative. Even Gore's pending proposal for a middle-class tax cut
has a Clinton provenance. As a candidate in 1992, Clinton promised
a middle-class tax cut, which he soon abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a Democratic consultant who is not involved with the
Gore campaign, said Gore had yet to break through to voters with a
clear sense of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for Al Gore is that Clinton put his imprint
every place on the issues, so for Al Gore to be able to find `his'
issues is a lot more difficult,'' Hart said. ``In the end, all of
these issues have to tell us something about Gore and what the
election is about. The problem is, the campaign needs a theme.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore began his strategic roll-out of issue speeches with
education to signal his belief that a strong education system is
the underpinning of a strong economy. ``In order to stay first in
the world economically, we must become first in the world
educationally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called for a substantial but unspecified federal investment
in public education. Apart from universal preschool and teacher
testing, he proposed a teacher corps, where young people teach in
needy schools in exchange for $10,000 for college. He proposed
``second-chance'' schools, in which students who ``are headed for
trouble'' are put into more disciplined environments.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would urge teachers and parents to meet at the
beginning of the school year and sign a strict discipline code, and
he would require that employers allow workers to take time off for
such meetings. He would extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to
allow time off for all parent-teacher conferences. And he would
require schools to teach ``character education'' courses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to reduce the size of classes to 18 students in early
grades and to no more than 20 for all grades. Opposing the use of
school vouchers, he said, ``We must reject the false promise of
siphoning public school funding away to private schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would use the technological revolution to replace
standardized textbook learning with individualized learning at each
child's own pace. He wants every child to be computer-literate by
the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Gore tax, a surcharge on every American's
telephone bill, has already collected $2 billion to hook up every
school in the country to the Internet. He would create a nationwide
volunteer army of ``e-tutors,'' or online instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposed a national tuition-savings program, and he
said he wants to create new tax-free 401-J accounts that let
workers save for job training and other educational experiences.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL 2NDTAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Gore advocates would require congressional approval
and might be hard to achieve if Republicans maintain control of the
House and Senate. In promising an overhaul of the criminal justice
system, for instance, he is calling for photo licenses for any
purchaser of a handgun and a ban on cheap handguns, and he wants to
increase penalties for gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also supports the administration's proposals for a
three-day waiting period before buying a gun, limiting purchases of
guns to one a month and requiring child-safety locks on handguns.
But some of those proposals were defeated in the House last month
after an intense campaign by the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will fight to protect America's families by launching the
most effective and comprehensive anti-crime strategy our nation has
seen,'' he said. ``I will change a political culture in Washington
that puts the interests of the gun lobby ahead of the needs of
American families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would quadruple the investment in after-school
programs and provide money for computer-mapping software for
police, so they can target crime hot spots. And he proposed
amending the Constitution to promote victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victims should have a voice in trial and other proceedings,''
he said, adding that they should also be notified when an offender
is released into their community.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would fight for a federal anti-gang law that set
curfews on specific gang members, a ban on gang-related clothing,
which some critics have said would be unconstitutional, and
authority to break up gangs.
</P>
<P>
   In another speech, he advocated using federal money for
religious organizations to help combat social problems like drug
addiction, gang violence and homelessness, a proposal Bush has also
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there is always a secular alternative for anyone
who wants one, and as long as no one is required to participate in
religious observances as a condition for receiving services,'' Gore
said, ``faith-based organizations can provide jobs and job
training, counseling and mentoring, food and basic medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would expand a provision in the welfare-to-work law
called Charitable Choice, which allows states to enlist faith-based
organizations to provide basic welfare services.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that companies usually provide matching gifts for
charitable contributions made by employees but that they generally
do not match gifts to faith-based organizations. He would encourage
them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   On cancer research, he said he would double to $9 billion the
amount the federal government spends over five years. He has also
set a goal of doubling the declines in cancer deaths over the next
10 years. ``This would mean that by 2010 each year, 700,000 fewer
Americans would get cancer and 200,000 less would die from it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual challenge to the scientific community, Gore has
called for researchers to identify by 2002 every gene that
predisposes people to cancer, and to develop blood tests and
diagnostic tests for every type of cancer within five years to
speed up detection.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would back legislation to require all health
plans to allow patients, including those on Medicare, to
participate in clinical trials, where they may receive the most
advanced treatments.

 &HT;    Great pitching would be a dream-come-true for contenders
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cincinnati Reds relief pitcher Scott Sullivan had
a dream recently, nothing like Martin Luther King's dream, more
like a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dreamed I was traded to the Chicago Cubs,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   For Sammy Sosa?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, more like a box of jock straps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that leads us to a similar subject.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league baseball teams still in contention are looking for
pitching, including the Cincinnati Reds, but they all seem to be
rummaging around in what amounts to boxes of frayed and well-worn
jock straps. And the teams who own them are asking exhorbitant
prices for inferior products.
</P>
<P>
   Teams out of contention want to get rid of their high-priced
(mostly overpriced) pitching failures. Why are those teams out of
contention? Because the pitchers they are offering weren't good
enough to put their teams in contention. General managers of those
teams are trying to foist their mistakes upon pitch-starved
contenders and contending GM's feel as if they are dealing with
Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   With the failure of Steve Avery, the sore shoulder owned by
Steve Parris, the ouchy rotator cuff of Pete Harnisch, the Reds'
starting staff is held together by baling wire, Scotch tape and
safety pins.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jack McKeon had to rob the bullpen of Dennys Reyes and
Gabe White to start games this week. And who does every team that
talks to general manager Jim Bowden want? Relief pitchers. . .Danny
Graves, Scott Williamson, Reyes, or starter Brett Tomko. As McKeon
and Bowden both put it, ``We'd have to rob Peter to pay Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were general manager of the Reds, would you do any of
this?
</P>
<P>
   Bowden talked to Los Angeles general manager Kevin Malone about
Ismael Valdes. Malone wants Williamson or Graves and a minor-league
prospect. For that, the Reds get a pitcher who is 8-8 with a 3.33
earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is in pursuit of Tampa Bay's Rolando Arrojo, but GM Chuck
LaMarr wants Reyes. For that, the Reds get a pitcher who 2-6 with a
6.62 ERA, was on the disabled list this year with shoulder
tendinitis and is listed as 31, but may be as old as 35. He is a
bargain at $800,000 and isn't eligible for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, though, has stiff competition for Arrojo. The New York
Yankees had four scouts at his last start, the Cardinals are
interested and Houston was interested. ``They are overplaying their
hand in what they want,'' an Astros scout said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden talked to Anaheim general manager Bill Bavasi about Omar
Olivares. Bavasi wants Graves and starter Brett Tomko. For that,
the Reds get a pitcher who is 8-9 with a 4.05 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same everywhere. Montreal would trade Dustin Hermanson.
Why not? He is 3-10 with a 5.53 ERA. The Cubs would trade Steve
Trachsel. Why not? He is 3-14 with a 6.55 ERA. The Dodgers would
trade Carlos Perez. Why not? He is 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA and is owed
$12.6 million over the next three years. The Rockies would trade
Darryl Kile. Why not? He is 5-10 with a 6.35 ERA and is owed $8
million next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sellers market and the demand is so great teams are
going to overspend for underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Seattle's Jeff Fassero (4-11, 6.86) pitched
against Kansas City's Kevin Appier (8-9, 5.00). Both are available.
Scouts were tripping over each other in the media dining room.
</P>
<P>
   So all this leaves Bowden in a Catch-22. He can add starting
pitching, as bogus and as dubious as some of those guys are, but it
would cost him greatly in his bullpen, the team's strongest asset.
</P>
<P>
   Some stolen advice for Bowden, ``Just say no.''

U.S. KNEW EARLY OF NAZI KILLINGS IN ASYLUMS, OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
SHOW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The diplomats at the U.S. consulate in Leipzig,
Germany, noticed a lot of strange death notices in the local
newspapers in the fall of 1940. Some of the deceased were old, some
not so old, but their deaths had something in common.
</P>
<P>
   They died at the Grafeneck asylum, an institution in
Wuerttemberg in southwestern Germany for people who were mentally
feeble from age or war, or who had been born severely retarded or
grotesquely malformed. And their relatives were not notified of
their deaths until the remains had been cremated.
</P>
<P>
   A death notice placed by a woman honoring her father, winner of
an Iron Cross in World War I, was typical: ``After weeks of
uncertainty, I received the unbelievable news of his sudden death
and cremation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans asked their German acquaintances what was
happening. The Germans said they believed that the Third Reich was
killing people it deemed useless. On Oct. 16, 1940, Vice Consul
Paul H. Dutko cabled that information to his superiors at the U.S.
Embassy in Berlin and the State Department in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of the present, of course, there is
nothing surprising about Dutko's cable. But many historians have
assumed that the first hard evidence of Germany's ``euthanasia''
program, which killed thousands of people and was a precursor to
the Holocaust, did not surface in the West until mid-1941, when it
was described in William L. Shirer's ``Berlin Diary.''
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an educational
and research organization in Los Angeles, have come upon documents,
including Dutko's cable, which seem to show that high U.S.
officials knew, or should have known, about the killings by late
1940, if not before. Some of the material hints at the coming of
the Holocaust itself.
</P>
<P>
   Did a difference of a half-year or so really matter? Yes, argues
the Wiesenthal Center's founder, Rabbi Marvin Hier. If high U.S.
officials had condemned the killing as soon as they learned of it,
Hier said, ``thousands of lives would have been saved.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, Hier said his researchers found the
recently declassified documents in the National Archives and in
State Department files while looking for data on the Nazis'
treatment of slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   One previously undisclosed document was a 10-page letter that
the Evangelical bishop of Wuerttemberg, Theophil Wurm, wrote on
July 10, 1940, to the Reich Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision as to the time when the life of a suffering human
being should end rests with the almighty God,'' the bishop
admonished, expressing dismay at the euthanasia rumors he had
heard.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the letter was obtained by Dutko early in 1941 and
forwarded to his superiors, who apparently shelved it.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1941, a prominent Roman Catholic bishop, Clemens
August Graf von Galen, delivered a sermon against euthanasia.
Germans learned of the sermon by word of mouth, and Hitler was so
worried about losing popular support, the rabbi said, that he
called off the killing of Germans who were deemed inferior or
useless.
</P>
<P>
   Hier argued that international condemnation of the
domestic-killing program at its early stage could have saved lives.
Perhaps public opinion might have turned against Hitler at home.
Perhaps the full-scale Holocaust might have been delayed, and
people everywhere might have recognized the reality of it earlier.
Millions still might have died, he conceded, but hundreds of
thousands might not have.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans were slow to accept reports of the wholesale
slaughter of Jews and others in countries under Nazi control. As
late as January 1943, fewer than half of those surveyed in a Gallup
poll believed reports that as many as two million European Jews had
been killed. By then, the Holocaust had been under way for many
months.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey C. Ward, a historian who has written extensively on the
Roosevelt era, said he doubted that early publicity about and
condemnation of the killing of Germans deemed inferior would have
made a difference, at least in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sad as it is,'' Ward said, the American people at that time
would not have been willing to go to war to save the lives of
Germans in asylums.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dutko cabled his superiors in October 1940 of ``fantastic and
gruesome'' stories from German civilians, stories of army trucks
entering and leaving Grafeneck in the dead of night, of soldiers
shooing away the curious. The local residents believed that some
patients at Grafeneck were being used as guinea pigs for medical
experiments and then killed. Others were regarded as useless, even
for laboratory tests, the residents said, and were being killed
outright.
</P>
<P>
   Some Germans said doctors and nurses had whispered rumors about
similar killings elsewhere in the country, some by electrocution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government is murdering masses of the spiritually ill and
other sick persons in experimental stations with poison gas,'' read
a letter that reached the American Embassy in Berlin in 1941. The
writer said she was a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Hier, like others who have studied the Holocaust and American
attitudes toward Nazi Germany before the United States entered
World War II, condemned the State Department's inaction. Some
historians have said the State Department of that era was at best
lukewarm to Jewish interests, at worst blatantly anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Hier did not blame Roosevelt directly for the United States'
slowness to react. The president, after all, was trying to help
Britain in 1940 and 1941 without stirring up his isolationist
enemies and without getting his country into a war before it was
ready. The rabbi said he had found no documents proving that
Roosevelt knew the extent of his State Department's sloth.
</P>
<P>
   William J. vanden Heuvel, president of the Franklin and Eleanor
Roosevelt Institute and a former deputy permanent representative of
the United States to the United Nations, differed with Hier's
assertions while calling them impossible to disprove.
</P>
<P>
   Vanden Heuvel said he believed that ``winning the war was the
only way to stop Hitler,'' and that the Nazis demonstrated
repeatedly that they were ``not at all susceptible to public
opinion.'' He noted that Roosevelt was one of the earliest world
leaders to denounce Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Condemning the anti-Jewish rampage of Kristallnacht in November
1938, the president said, ``I myself could scarcely believe that
such things could occur in a 20th-century civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the earliest documents discovered by Hier's researchers
was a Feb. 23, 1940, memorandum to Secretary of State Cordell Hull
from Assistant Secretary Adolf A. Berle Jr. Berle told of reports
from the embassy in Berlin that Jews were being sent to ``unnamed
concentration camps'' in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no reason why we should not make our feelings known
regarding a policy of seemingly calculated cruelty which is
beginning to be apparent now,'' Berle said. (It was not yet known
that the camps would soon be extermination centers.)
</P>
<P>
   One of Berle's colleagues, Assistant Secretary Breckinridge
Long, wrote that he was ``thoroughly in sympathy with the
sentiment'' in Berle's memorandum. But, he went on, ``this is a
question entirely within the power of Germany,'' and he warned
against any action that might involve the United States in the war
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The War Department, too, obtained information about the killings
in Germany. In December 1940, it received a letter, originally sent
in German to NBC and just found by Hier's staff, in which the
writer said that ``thousands of patients are secretly murdered
monthly, not only those who are public wards but also the paying
inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi said it was not known how high in the department the
letter went before it was shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Hier said there were few heroes in the whole sad episode, except
for people like the anonymous German nurse and the person who wrote
to NBC in December 1940, risking their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``With your expressions of horror prevent further murders!'' the
letter to NBC said. It was signed, ``a Christian who cannot bear to
witness this any longer.''

 NEW PROGRAMS HELP TAME YOUR WEB SURFARI  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Whether you're interested in the music of Bali or the price of
bicycles, locating the information you need is only the first
challenge when you're using the Web for research.
<P>
   Then comes the problem of saving, organizing and perhaps
printing what you found so that you won't have to repeat the search
when you want to refer back to it or share it with colleagues,
family or friends.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Internet Explorer nor Netscape Navigator helps much with
such chores. Fortunately, there now are nearly a dozen Windows
utilities that provide new ways to preserve and present information
from the Web. I've checked out quite a few, and from those, I've
picked three that I found particularly valuable. They're all either
free or inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three utilities, SurfSaver, is &LR;   &LR; designed primarily
for users who simply want a digital filing cabinet _ a quick and
easy way to store, search and retrieve valuable pages on their own
PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The second program, KeeBoo, is aimed at those who want to
assemble pages they have collected (and non-Web files, too) into
attractive ``electronic books'' that can be shared easily with
other computer users.
</P>
<P>
   The third utility is a new version of Web PrintSmart, a program
from Hewlett-Packard Co. that originally appeared last year. As the
name suggests, this program focuses on providing more and better
ways to turn Web information into hard copy.
</P>
<P>
   SURFSAVER 1.5
</P>
<P>
   This program is easy to install. Once set up, it's completely
unobtrusive _ so much so that I had to read the electronic
documentation even to find it. The secret, in Internet Explorer, is
to click anywhere on a Web page with the right-hand mouse button;
in Navigator, you click on the Bookmark pop-up or a SurfSaver
button that's added to your personal toolbar.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you'll find new SurfSaver Save and SurfSaver Search
options. When you're saving, you can add keywords or notes to be
stored with the file and choose whether or not to have graphics
saved. By default, everything you save goes into one ``Archive''
folder, but you can easily create topic-specific folders.
</P>
<P>
   SurfSaver folders are displayed in one handy list, and a
QuickSave option lets you save the current page, with just one
mouse click, to the same location as your last save.
</P>
<P>
   SurfSaver's real advantage, though, shows up when you search,
because the program offers a slew of new options. You can search by
date of capture, or for any word or phrase on the page or in your
notes, your keywords or the original URL. Professional researchers
will find such advanced options as Boolean and proximity searching.
Searching is speedy, and when SurfSaver finds the page you're
after, you can open it in your browser _ with all of its original
formatting intact _ including frames and tables.
</P>
<P>
   What it all adds up to, once you've gotten the SurfSaver habit,
is a virtually painless way to store pages you find interesting and
retrieve them whenever you want.
</P>
<P>
   KEEBOO
</P>
<P>
   This application, which you launch separately from your browser,
uses a book-and-bookcase metaphor to help you organize and present
material you find on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To open an existing book, you click on its spine on the shelf.
When you start a project, you select ``New Book'' from the
program's File menu. A Wizard then asks you to give it a title,
confirm the default author information (name, e-mail address and a
picture) and even specify what color jacket the book should have
and on which shelf of your bookcase it should go.
</P>
<P>
   Once your book has been created, you add pages by dragging and
dropping icons or links from your browser into the KeeBoo window.
You also can add files from your own hard disk _ the program can
handle a long list of word processing, graphics and spreadsheet
file formats.
</P>
<P>
   As you add material, KeeBoo automatically generates an
interactive table of contents _ clicking on the item opens the
page. Creating chapters and reordering the pages is a breeze. You
can highlight text on your pages, add your own sticky notes and
search the contents of the book.
</P>
<P>
   When you're done, you can e-mail the book, either in a format
readable only by other KeeBoo users or as a ``Web book,'' which can
be read on any Windows PC with Internet Explorer 4.01, Netscape
Navigator 4.0 or later versions.
</P>
<P>
   KeeBoo was released barely a month ago, and its immaturity
shows. I ran into several formatting glitches: Highlighting
sometimes changes the style of text and long table-of-contents
entries are truncated when a book is exported. Sometimes, the
program kept putting up annoying dialogs warning that my
``Graphical resources were running low.'' The online Help file is
generally good, but it is misleading on one key issue _ where to
find the icon you need to drag to put a page open in Internet
Explorer into a KeeBoo book.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, for me and anyone else who might want to send a
KeeBoo book to a Mac user, the company doesn't support the Apple
system at all. It's not just that there's no Mac version of KeeBoo;
you can't even export your books in a format readable on the Mac.
That's particularly annoying because KeeBoo's ``Web books''
ultimately are just HTML pages, which are perfectly readable on the
Mac, but the program wraps them up in an executable file that runs
only on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   In short, KeeBoo is a promising package, but the developers have
lots of work to do before the program lives up to its potential.
</P>
<P>
   WEB PRINTSMART 2.0
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest version of a utility I found handy in its
initial release. In many ways, the update is a major improvement,
starting with the fact that it works with any Windows printer, not
just HP ones. On the other hand, I'm afraid that the developers
caught a bad case of featuritis; what started as a fairly simple
utility now is a large and sometimes confusing application.
</P>
<P>
   The program's original purpose was to produce neater,
better-looking hard copy of Web pages than the misformatted
monstrosities that Web browsers often generate. (Whole forests have
given their lives to make the paper that gets wasted when single
Web pages print out broken up over three or four mostly empty
pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Version 2.0, both the free and $29.95 versions, goes a long way
toward eliminating such problems, mainly by modifying page layouts
slightly to make them fit in the available print area. Both let you
combine multiple pages into one file, add other graphics files,
apply style sheets to ensure a uniform look, preview before
printing, and generate a cover sheet, table of contents and index
of links.
</P>
<P>
   In short, you get most of the functionality of KeeBoo.
</P>
<P>
   The Plus Version gives more formatting choices, including the
ability to change the fonts and remove unwanted page breaks. It
also comes with lifetime online support; HP also supports the free
version online _ but only for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   My problem with Version 2.0, both free and paid, is that HP
turned the main Web PrintSmart application into something that's
virtually a Web browser in its own right, complete with browserlike
buttons and its own set of Favorites.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not a very capable Web browser, and HP has added a
page in its online support noting that the program is not designed
to be a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   If HP wants to take on Microsoft and Netscape in the browser and
e-mail arenas, more power to it. But if not, going halfway just
adds confusion and complexity to the user experience. In Version
3.0, I hope the company will narrow its aspirations and refocus on
Web PrintSmart's core formatting and printing features.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you can take advantage of its most important features
while continuing to use your current Web browser. Just launch the
Web PrintSmart application, go to its Preferences screen and check
``Display PrintSmart toolbar when running external browser.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to check out Web PrintSmart, be sure to use the URL
listed in the table accompanying this story. It's almost impossible
to find from HP's home page.

GOOD CHEMISTRY AT WORK IN `RUNAWAY BRIDE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
BY BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine years after whipping up that questionable but
popular confection ``Pretty Woman,'' Julia Roberts and Richard Gere
reteam with director Garry Marshall for another romantic comedy
souffle, ``Runaway Bride.'' This one, if you can believe it, is
even sweeter than the hooker movie (and it's PG rated, no less).
Yet for all its contrivance and cutesiness, ``Runaway Bride'' works
its way into some genuinely compelling emotional territory that
``Pretty Woman'' didn't dare acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   That's not something one usually associates with Gere's or,
especially, Roberts' movies, let alone Marshall's, the director
who's developed plastic glibness into a way of cinematic life
(``The Other Sister,'' ``Exit to Eden,'' ``Frankie and Johnny,'' on
and on ...). But maybe, as with Roberts' other summer comedy,
``Notting Hill,'' the script's echoes of her own life experience
helped bring out something truer than usual in her ``Bride''
performance. She's not just her usual charming self here; she's
actually poignant in a way she's never been before, like she really
means it this time.
</P>
<P>
   That said, false notes are struck throughout ``Bride,'' among
them an adorably raunchy granny and a small town so idealized (at
first, anyway) that it appears to keep a barbershop quartet on
permanent retainer. But when Roberts and Gere finally get their
wounded characters to open up to each other, it's not just those
fictional individuals who have a date set for redemption. You get
into a forgiving mood for the whole movie.
</P>
<P>
   He's Ike Graham, a misogynistic New York newspaper columnist
(lots of USA Today product placements here) who, writer's-blocked
and deadline looming, exaggerates a report about a small-town
Maryland woman who's repeatedly dumped grooms at the altar. The
lady with the cold but fast feet, Roberts' Maggie Carpenter, fires
off a letter listing the piece's inaccuracies, which promptly gets
Ike fired by his editor, and ex-wife, Ellie (Rita Wilson).
</P>
<P>
   Ike's only chance to salvage his career is to write a
better-reported magazine article on Maggie. So it's off to pretty
little Hale, Md., where cynical city journalists are less than
welcome _ especially by Maggie, who's about to make wedding attempt
No. 4 with local high school coach and all-around motivational guy
Bob (Christopher Meloni).
</P>
<P>
   Hate at first sight gives way to grudging respect as Ike
ingratiates himself with all of Maggie's friends, relatives and
ex-fiances. She despises his prying, but it gradually dawns on her
that no man she's ever known has been quite so interested in
learning what makes her tick. And since she gives as good as she
gets _ Maggie's together enough to run the family hardware store
with the capability and knowledge of a master carpenter _ she
forces Ike to confront his own unexamined attitudes about
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the already proven Gere-Roberts chemistry and watch the
romantic fun bubble up. Only this time, it's laced with both
convincingly conveyed neurosis and a rather lovely, humanistic
appreciation of even the most caricatured participants, like gung
ho Coach Bob and Maggie's weirdo best friend, played by Joan
Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   The big question the film poses is, of course, what makes Maggie
run? Some might be satisfied by the answer ``Bride'' takes its
sweet time getting to, but others definitely won't be. But it's
hard to call that a flaw in the sometimes too silly, mostly
well-designed script by Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott. After
all, this is a story about nosy modern journalism's attempt to
glibly oversimplify the workings of a woman's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a little mystery can be a very good thing, not to
mention the most honest thing. And lord knows, movies like
``Runaway Bride'' need all the honesty that they can shoehorn in. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Runaway Bride'' (PG; language). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Joan Cusack, Christopher
Meloni, Hector Elizondo, Rita Wilson, Paul Dooley. &UR;  &QL;

McGibbon and Sara Parriott. Released by Paramount Pictures. &UR;  &QL;

   Falcons pull offer; fines await Anderson
</P>
<P>
   By Matt Winkeljohn
</P>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The Falcons rescinded their latest offer to
running back Jamal Anderson on Wednesday and coach Dan Reeves said
there will be no further contract extension negotiation until the
running back reports to training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons players reported Wednesday to Furman University, where
practice begins at 3 p.m. today. Anderson, an All-Pro last season,
is at home in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offer was pulled off the table at noon,'' Reeves said.
``He gets fined ($5,000) every day he's not here because he does
have a contract. It hurts our . . . team.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 26, led the NFC last season with a franchise-record
1,846 yards on an NFL-record 410 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The final year of his contract calls for a salary of $1.6
million plus another $1 million in incentives triggered last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't say we wouldn't negotiate any more; this is more a
move to protect (the franchise),'' general manager Harold
Richardson said. ``What's to stop a guy from coming in here the
third week of the season and saying, `OK, I'll take that deal'?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an ultimatum; it's just common sense. We want him
here sooner than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Something might happen quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's agent, Jim Sims of Oakland, leaves Friday for a
two-week vacation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a sense they will try to get a deal done by the end
of training camp, we'll get Jamal in there,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   The next move is Anderson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can say to me they're going to work on it,'' he said,
``something may change. I have every intention of honoring my
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The sides are in agreement on a five- or six-year deal worth
$28million to $34 million, but the signing bonus and yearly salary
schedule remain the holdup.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had sought a bonus of more than $10 million and then
dropped it to $8 million. The Falcons had countered at $6 million
and recently went to $7 million. Also, Anderson and Sims want more
of the money in the first three years and more of the $9million
fifth-year compensation moved to the fourth season.

14 UMPIRES SAY UNION'S STRATEGY WAS DOOMED TO FAIL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the National League debated which 13 umpires to
jettison from its suddenly crowded staff, a group of 14 umpires
Wednesday lamented the loss of any jobs and said its union
leadership's ``flawed strategy'' had hurt the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the business day, the league had not completed a
task its officials did not pursue with exuberance. ``It's not
easy,'' one baseball official said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials left no question that 13 umpires would be lopped
off the NL staff to which 13 minor league umpires had been added
before 32 umpires rescinded their resignations Tuesday. The task is
expected to be finished Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Umpires in both leagues who had withdrawn their resignations
last week were told their jobs would be safe. However, the umpires
who rescinded Tuesday, after the union lost the initial round of
its court fight, had no guarantee that they would continue working
after Sept. 2, the effective date of the resignations. The American
League had notified nine of its umpires that their resignations had
been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Only four NL umpires were assured of their jobs. Mark Hirschbeck
never resigned, Wally Bell and Jeff Nelson withdrew their
resignations soon after submitting them and Greg Bonin's letter of
resignation, which the union said he signed, never reached the
league office.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck, Bell and Nelson joined 11 AL umpires in issuing a
statement Wednesday that punctuated the division that the
resignation strategy has created in the Major League Umpires
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major league umpires have been seriously harmed,'' the
statement said, ``because union leadership adopted a flawed
strategy that was doomed to fail from the beginning. The advice to
quit jobs in order to keep them made no sense at all, especially
under a collective bargaining contract that not only ruled out
strikes, but also ruled out `other concerted work stoppage.'''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the loss of 22 jobs, the statement said: ``It grieves
us that more than 20 umpires will apparently lose their jobs as a
result of this flawed and doomed strategy. We have been able to
save some of our colleagues by convincing them not to resign or to
quickly rescind their resignations. If we had not taken a stand,
all major league umpires could be facing the end of their
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the umpires said, ``It is essential that we proceed
with a realistic view of the world and do what is in the best
interest of all umpires, our families and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 AL umpires who issued the statement, John Hirschbeck,
Joe Brinkman, Terry Craft, Tim McClelland and Durwood Merrill never
resigned, and Gary Cederstrom, Jim Joyce, Dave Phillips, Rocky Roe,
Dale Scott and Tim Welke resigned but rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Welke had been members of the union's board of
directors, but they resigned from the union, John Hirschbeck said,
when they rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   The statement made no mention of Richard Phillips, the union
leader, who designed the resignation strategy. Asked if the signing
umpires would call for Phillips to step down as the union's chief
negotiator, a position that pays him more than $300,000 a year,
John Hirschbeck said: ``At this point, no. We're leaving open our
options at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, a lawyer from Philadelphia, did not return a telephone
call seeking comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the umpires who issued the statement have not formed a
formal group, John Hirschbeck and Brinkman are considered the
leaders of the anti-Phillips bloc because they have been the most
outspoken in questioning the strategy of the union leadership. They
led the opposition to Phillips when he received a five-year
extension last February.
</P>
<P>
   Two other umpires didn't resign and eight others withdrew their
resignations, but their names were not on the statement. Hirschbeck
said they could not be reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, Hirschbeck said, was issued in response to
comments that union leaders and other umpires had made about the
so-called dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time that people, starting with our fellow
umpires, know what this was all about,'' Hirschbeck, a 16-year AL
umpire, said in a telephone interview. ``Accusations have been made
that it was personal, and it's anything but personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Several umpires said the dissidents acted as they did because
they had a vendetta against Phillips. ``Why would I have a vendetta
against Richie?'' Hirschbeck said. ``I felt for a long time that we
have not been receiving good union leadership. That's what this is
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the statement could widen the division in the union,
Hirschbeck said: ``I think the division that's there has been
created by the union leadership and the flawed strategy. Telling
union members to resign from their jobs was doomed from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck said he did not think the position he and the others
had taken would weaken the union's negotiating position for a new
labor contract to replace the current agreement, which expires Dec.
31.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Senate debates plans this week to lower taxes, Democrats
point to Republican proposals for $800 billion in cuts over 10
years and cry foul: the rich come away with gargantuan tax
reductions compared with those for everyone else. Republican
leaders respond that their large tax cuts are fair because
high-income families pay a gargantuan share of federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Whose arguments win?
</P>
<P>
   There are two issues. Many budget experts say that congressional
estimates of the effect of the proposed Senate bill and the bill
the House passed last week are stacked with assumptions that make
the tax cuts look more even than they truly are. Estimates by
Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group, which uses
methods akin to those adopted by independent budget experts, show
that the Republican bills pile up tax cuts for high-income families
far beyond their share of the current tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the fight over numbers, there is a dispute over
principle. The seemingly innocuous idea that the distribution of
federal tax cuts should mirror the distribution of current tax
payments is anything but innocuous.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would cut income-tax rates across the board by 10
percent, reduce the tax on capital gains, phase out the estate tax,
increase tax deductions for married couples and provide several
corporate tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican bill would cut the bottom income-tax rate
to 14 percent from 15 percent, raise the income threshold for the
28 percent tax bracket, lower the tax on married couples and
increase deductions for retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to Citizens for Tax Justice, the House bill is heavily
tilted in favor of the rich. Those making more than $300,000 a
year, the top 1 percent, would receive about 45 percent of the
total tax cut, an average around $54,000 each. By contrast, the 20
percent of taxpayers earning less than about $13,000 would get only
about half a percent of the total cut _ about $30 each.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill distributes the tax cut less unevenly. The top 1
percent of taxpayers would receive about 30 percent of the tax
cuts, and the top 20 percent would receive 76 percent of the cuts.
Estimates by the Treasury Department are similar, though its
numbers for high-income families are somewhat smaller in part
because it does not take account, as Citizens for Tax Justice does,
of proposed cuts in corporate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans offer two rebuttals. First, tables provided by
the House Ways and Means Committee show that the top 2 percent of
taxpayers pay 40 percent of federal income taxes, and the top 15
percent pay about 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a research group, says that the focus on income
taxes is misleading: ``Perhaps two-thirds of families pay more in
payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. So the share of total
taxes that the richest families pay is considerably smaller than
the tables from the House Republicans indicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Republicans defend their proposals by pointing to
tables from the Joint Committee on Taxation. These estimates do
take account of payroll and other federal taxes. The numbers show
that the Senate and House bills spread benefits almost evenly so
that the share of tax payments across income groups barely budge.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenstein considers these tables highly misleading. ``The
committee's tables only go through 2004,'' he said. ``But most of
the tax cuts that primarily favor wealthy families _ for example, a
provision in the House bill that prevents high-income families from
using tax shelters to eliminate most of their tax _ would phase in
largely after 2005.'' Besides, the committee's estimates exclude
some provisions, like cutting estate taxes, that overwhelmingly
benefit wealthy families. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Tax Justice estimates the effect of all the key
provisions of the tax bills when they are fully carried out. Its
figures show that the tax cuts would go disproportionately to
upper-income families _ their share of the proposed tax cuts exceed
their current share of total tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the group estimates that the 20 percent of
taxpayers with the highest incomes pay 67 percent of total federal
taxes under current law. But these families would receive almost 80
percent of the tax cuts under the House plan and 76 percent under
the Senate plan.
</P>
<P>
   The top 5 percent of taxpayers account for about 40 percent of
payments under current law, but would reap more than 60 percent of
the tax cuts under the House plan and 47 percent under the Senate
measure.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the bottom 60 percent of the families account for
almost 15 percent of current federal tax payments but would receive
only 9 percent of the savings under the House bill and less than 11
percent under the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond economics, there is an important debate over principle.
The Republican sponsors of the tax-cut bills say the cuts rightly
go to the families who pay most taxes. But to accept that principle
accepts the idea that Congress should not use the federal tax
system to alter the distribution of income _ a proposition that
runs counter to the longstanding use of progressive tax rates to
redistribute income from wealthier to poorer families.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when the wage rates of high-paid, educated workers are
soaring above wage rates for everyone else, the Republicans are
calling on the federal government to sit on the sidelines.
Greenstein asks why ``at a time when income disparities are at a
post-World War II high, should we be handing very large tax breaks
to the nation's wealthiest families.''

 SILENCED DISSIDENTS PUT OUT THE RALLYING CRY IN CYBERSPACE  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ The Berkeley, Calif., protesters demonstrating
outside radio station KPFA have a powerful tool that was not
available to their radical forebears in the 1960s: the Internet.
<P>
   The groundbreaking station may have taken its progressive voices
off the air, but there's no silencing cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had had this back in the '60s for the free speech
movement, it would have been great,'' said Susan Druding, who runs
one of the protest Web sites at www.fsm-a.org. ``It helps when
you're being muzzled by the media.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, angry about management changes at the venerable
lefty broadcaster, have taken their crusade online and
international with a host of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   They may even start Web-casting audio soon, putting the silenced
voices of KPFA onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the battle, the Pacifica Foundation, the
nonprofit parent of KPFA, has its own Web site, at which it posts
its own news releases about the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The country's oldest listener-sponsored station was closed two
weeks ago, shortly after marking its 50th anniversary, and Pacifica
is broadcasting tapes from its archives at its spot at 94.1 FM.
</P>
<P>
   The station has generated quite a bit of news so far this year,
including gunshots fired into Pacifica offices (no one was hurt),
the sudden firings of the KPFA station manager and others, a live
broadcast that caught security guards hauling off radio host Dennis
Bernstein after he discussed the controversy on his show, and the
arrest of more than 100 people at protests outside the station's
Berkeley offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests go on, both at the offices and on the Web. The
main protest sites at www.savepacifica.org and www.savepacifica.net
maintain a list of links to other angry listeners. ``People will
have a particular area of the conflict that they know about,'' and
they'll post information about their particular area of expertise,
Druding said.
</P>
<P>
   She cited a Web site at www.SineWave.com/ksvp/reply2divcoa2.htm
that addresses Pacifica's statements about its efforts to bring
greater cultural diversity to the station.
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons, organizers couldn't use KPFA to plug last
week's protest concert featuring Joan Baez and Utah Phillips, and
they couldn't afford to buy any ads. So they plastered a few
posters around, sent out lots of e-mail, advertised on the Web _
and engineered a sold-out show with an audience of 3,700 people.
``I really credit a lot of that to the Internet,'' Druding said.
</P>
<P>
   The groups' use of the Net also shows how the medium, for better
or worse, allows people with no formal training to act as
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Druding, who came to Berkeley in 1964 as a marine biology
student, ultimately earned a master's degree in textiles and owns
Straw Into Gold, a Berkeley crafts store specializing in spinning
and weaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going out to the rallies, I had my digital camera, and
I'm pretty good with graphics online, and I thought, I could
document what things look like,'' Druding said.
</P>
<P>
   When she heard rumors that the protesters were chucking Molotov
cocktails, she took photos of children playing in makeshift
sandboxes, people playing soccer in the street and a community of
protesters breaking bread together. ``It does not look like people
making Molotov cocktails,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the KPFA site at www.kpfa.org is barely
changed, except for a note explaining that ``KPFA staff is on
administrative leave. Regularly scheduled programming has been
replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica's site at www.pacifica.org looks like business as
usual, but its own news releases at the bottom of the home page are
dominated with headlines about KPFA. The most recent release is
from July 19 _ the day before Pacifica abruptly dismissed its
communications director, Elan Fabbri, and replaced her with San
Francisco image-buffers Fineman Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Fineman hasn't updated the Web site, it probably knows
something about steering Pacifica through the KPFA crisis.
Fineman's own Web site, www.finemanpr.com, describes how it helped
Odwalla map a strategy in the first few days of the E. coli product
recall crisis in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   TALK TALK: It's the domain name that got away. Talk, the new
magazine from former New Yorker and Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown,
is slated to launch next week after a year in the planning stages,
but the publication does not have the coveted cyberspace real
estate of www.talk.com.
</P>
<P>
   That domain name was available, for a price, as recently as
April, when San Francisco media firm Wired Digital sold it to a
telecommunications company in Reston, Va., that went by the name of
Tel-Save.com, and is now called Talk.com.
</P>
<P>
   Talk.com bought www.talk.com for an unspecified sum, but it
didn't fetch anywhere near the record $3 million that Compaq paid
for www.altavista.com. Instead, Talk.com Vice President Ed
Meyercord said his company got the name in a marketing deal that
involved buying ads on such Wired Digital properties as HotBot.
</P>
<P>
   Talk.com, which has long traded under the ticker symbol TALK,
offers long-distance and calling-card plans to Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown had to settle for www.talkmagazine.com. ``There was
never a discussion of talk.com,'' said spokeswoman Hilary Bass.
``It was always talkmagazine.'' The site will launch next week, but
it will only be a stopgap measure until a comprehensive site can
launch at a later date, Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER TECH BIZ PUB? _ In a market that's glutted with
magazines covering the nexus between business and technology, how
could anyone stand one more thing to read? Yet the glut obviously
indicates an interest in the subject, so here comes Mortimer
Zuckerman's Fast Company _ the fat monthly magazine published in
Massachusetts _ with a new quarterly venture, Net Company.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine ``will cover the new world of digital business in
much the same way that Fast Company covers the new world of work,''
according to the company's press release. It debuts on newsstands
August 24 and will go to Fast Company subscribers in the September
issue.
</P>
<P>
   That issue, by the way, clocks a fat 193 ad pages, while Net
Company launches with 11 ad pages.
</P>
<P>
   TECH TV: A new San Francisco company, B3TV, wants to provide
Internet-style e-commerce over television. The company is having
its coming-out party at Red Herring's ``Herring on Hollywood''
conference in Los Angeles next week and promises to announce
partnerships with a local cable station, a cult-hit television show
and a major advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, B3TV chief executive David Kaiser will only
talk about the technology, and the name _ which, as it turns out,
has no meaning. ``We wanted a name that looked like call letters,''
Kaiser said. ``We just made it up. It doesn't stand for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the domain name was available.

COMPAQ TO CUT 8,000 JOBS; LOST $184 MILLION IN SECOND QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Struggling to return to profitability, Compaq Computer Corp.
said Wednesday that it would cut up to 8,000 jobs, or about 12
percent of its worldwide work force, and take a third-quarter
charge of $700 million to $900 million as part of a cost-cutting
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also reported a second-quarter loss of $184 million, or
10 cents a diluted share, compared with profit from operations of
$32 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Sales rose 61 percent, to $9.42 billion from $5.83 billion,
excluding the results of Digital Equipment Corp., which Compaq
acquired, before June 11, 1998. Compaq said sales rose 17 percent
on a pro forma basis.
</P>
<P>
   Including charges related to the acquisition of Digital, Compaq
had a net loss of $3.63 billion, or $2.33 a share, in the second
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After Compaq warned last month that it would have a substantial
loss for the quarter, analysts estimated the company would lose 11
cents a share, according to First Call Corp., which tracks company
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Compaq released its results, its shares rose 56.25 cents,
to $25.9375. Compaq shares have lost half their value this year
amid disappointing earnings and management turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been losing money in the face of the Dell Computer
Corp.'s more efficient method of selling directly to customers.
Compaq is also saddled with the higher development costs of the
large computer systems businesses it acquired with Digital and
Tandem Computers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Michael D. Capellas, the acting chief operating
officer who was chosen last week as Compaq's president and chief
executive, said, ``We are aggressively taking the appropriate
actions to restore the company's growth and financial
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The realignment of the company is fully under way,'' he added.
``Over all, we expect the realignment to have a positive effect on
both gross margin and operating expenses going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts announced Wednesday would bring Compaq's total
employment to 59,000. Compaq, which now has 69,000 employees, still
has about 2,000 jobs left to cut from an earlier reorganization
that reduced the work force by 20 percent. Compaq has said it will
shave $2 billion in annual costs and reorganize its business groups
to improve financial accountability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would take a charge of $700 million to $900
million in the third quarter to cover costs of the reorganization.
More details will be released as the company makes decisions about
operations to be closed or groups to be combined.  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Analysts said the cuts were the kind of aggressive moves that
Compaq needed to undertake if it was to return to profitability.
Compaq's costs are still far too high for the company to be
profitable on the relatively thin profit margins offered by the
personal computer industry. And Compaq's efforts to retain its
position as the largest PC supplier have required deep discounting
that only weakens margins further, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically have the gross margins of a pure PC company,
but they've got DEC and Tandem in the mix, which should have higher
margins,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. Costs
are ``all just a little bit too high; the math doesn't work,'' he
said. ``For the next couple of quarters, it just doesn't look too
hot for the likelihood of them making money.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Compaq quoted reports by the International Data Corp.
showing that it gained 2.2 percentage points in United States PC
market share from the quarter a year earlier, to 16.6 percent, and
that its worldwide PC market share grew to 14.6 percent. But from

just 0.1 percent, while Dell grew by 0.8 percent and IBM rose by

   ``At least Capellas seems to understand the magnitude of the
problems,'' said Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon
Read. ``Now they have to execute on solving them. They have to
integrate DEC, and please customers, and prioritize on what they're
going to fix first.''

   Tuberville switches off Auburn `soap opera'
</P>
<P>
   By Tony Barnhart
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM _ Tommy Tuberville was thrilled on Wednesday to
address the media about the Auburn football team for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Really. Even though the prognosis for the Tigers this fall is
not good. In fact, most preseason magazines have them finishing
last in a competitive SEC Western Division.
</P>
<P>
   But for Tuberville, talking about the relative strengths and
weaknesses of his first Auburn team was preferable to dealing with
all of the negative events that hit the school in the past 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auburn hired me to coach a football team, not to sit around
and watch soap operas,'' Tuberville said.
</P>
<P>
   But a soap opera, and a bad one at that, is what Auburn has
becomesince Oct. 23, when coach Terry Bowden suddenly resigned.
Since then just about everybody has taken a shot at the proud
Auburn family.
</P>
<P>
   And the controversy is far from over, given these headlines from
the past 10 days:
</P>
<P>
   _ A judge has ordered former assistant coach Bill Oliver and the
school to mediation over a lawsuit that could get really ugly if it
goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kent Partridge, the school's highly respected sports
information director, grew tired of being the middle man in the
fiasco. He has resigned and is going to Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key alumni wondered on the record this week whether a complete
housecleaning might be in order at the athletics department.
</P>
<P>
   When Auburn opens the season on Sept. 4 against Appalachian
State, the media will remind the world again that the Tigers bought
their way out of a game against Florida State. More than one person
will suggest that Auburn's battle cry should be ``War Chicken''
rather than the beloved ``War Eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was a relief, Tuberville said, to be talking about
football finally, even if the talk isn't especially positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have a schedule to play, that gives people
something to focus on,'' he said. ``If we win, that's great. But
even if we lose, people will be talking about the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's players echoed Tuberville's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that after everything this team has
been through, we're still together,'' defensive tackle Jimmy
Brumbaugh said. ``Now, we all want to focus on football and really
give people something to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville knows about taking over programs in trouble. When he
became head coach at Mississippi in 1995, the school was hit with
two years of NCAA probation and the loss of 24 scholarships. Many
people predicted that it would be five or six years before the
football program would recover. By Tuberville's third season, the
Rebels were 8-4 and in the Motor City Bowl. In his final season,
Ole Miss reached the Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to offer here at Auburn. We have great fans,
great facilities, and a winning tradition,'' he said. ``But right
now, the Auburn family is divided. Our job is to bring them back
together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Auburn family probably won't be able to rally around a
winning football team. Eight starters return on defense, but the
offense lacks talent at the skill positions. Auburn's top two
running backs from a year ago, Michael Burks and Demontray Carter,
no longer are in the program. Clifton Robinson, the top receiver
from a year ago, still faces rape charges and might not return.
After Robinson, Auburn has no proven receivers. Sophomore
quarterback Gabe Gross completed 44.7 percent of his passes last
year and is fighting a sore arm.
</P>
<P>
   And even without Florida State, Auburn plays the toughest
schedule in the SEC. The Tigers are the only team in the Western
Division that plays all three Eastern Division powers _ Tennessee,
Florida, and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Auburn's players are looking forward to playing _ and
maybe getting a chance at redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to feel like we did last year when we went 3-8,''
tackle Jeno James said. ``That why we're so anxious to get started.
It's the only way we can fix what is wrong.''

 &HT;    Jordan shooting for Friday return
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Friday is only a target date for the return of Braves
cleanup hitter Brian Jordan, but he'll have to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had a second cortisone shot in his right hand on
Wednesday, this shot in a knuckle as opposed to his wrist, and he
is hoping the pain subsides enough for him to return to the lineup
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who was hit by a Mike Thurman pitch on June 22, has been
bothered since. He's been out of the lineup since Sunday to rest
his ailing right hand and right shoulder. He also has a pinched
nerve in his right shoulder but said that's an injury he can play
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can deal with the shoulder, it's the hand,'' Jordan said.
``If I can get my hand all right, I don't mind lacking some power.
I'll keep hitting my line drives.''
</P>
<P>
   If his hand is still bothering him on Friday, Jordan will have a
bone scan to determine if there's a break. No fracture is showing
up on X-rays.Trade talks
</P>
<P>
   As the trade deadline nears, the Braves continue to surface in
potential deals around baseball. In the leadoff hitting/lead field
department, Tony Phillips has resurfaced as a distinct possibility
to join the Braves at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old has been playing second base for the A's most of
this season but was brought to Oakland to play left field. He's
cooled off since the All-Star break, going 9-for-his-last-53 to
drop his batting average to .234. But his on-base percentage of
.342 is significantly better than the .309 on-base percentage the
Braves leadoff hitters were hitting through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is Cubs shortstop/utility player Jose
Hernandez (.269 with 13 homers, 37 RBIs, .355 on-base percentage),
who the Braves have discussed as an offensive upgrade for the top
of the order. Arizona is also after Hernandez, seeking a
replacement for Andy Fox, but the Braves have been more aggressive
in talks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' roll
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan still out, Andruw Jones was hitting cleanup against
left-hander Bill Pulsipher on Wednesday night. And the way Jones
has been swinging lately, it makes good sense.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has seven home runs this month, including his 21st of the
season on Tuesday night off Hideo Nomo, keeping pace with Ryan
Klesko, who has eight home runs this month and Chipper Jones, who
has 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being real patient,'' Jones said. ``I'm seeing the ball
good. I know what pitches they're going to throw. I know the
situation. With a man on second, I'm not just going to hack.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for his slow starts, Jones would have an easy shot at 40
home runs. He's on pace to hit 33 home runs, which is two more than
he had last season. Jones hit .272 with four home runs this April
and in his three major league seasons he's hit .240 in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully one day I'll start good in April so I can make an
All-Star team,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly . . .
</P>
<P>
   Braves trainer Dave Pursley said Dr. James Andrews had reviewed
Odalis Perez's MRI and has recommended he go ahead with surgery to
repair his torn medial collateral ligament. The surgery hasn't been
scheduled yet. . . .Reliever John Hudek rejected his minor league
assignment with the Braves, as expected. He has until Friday to
clear waivers and if he does, the Braves will release him. Hudek
was 0-1 with a 6.48 ERA in 15 appearances for the Braves.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Nine men know what happened inside a 7-by-9-foot cell in
Florida State Prison on the morning of July 17, when prison guards
armed with stun guns arrived to forcibly extract Frank Valdez, a
death-row inmate who murdered a corrections officer 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez, his body marked with bruises in the shape of boot prints
and his ribs broken, was beaten to death, state investigators said.
The nine, all corrections officers who the investigators said
either witnessed, knew about or took part in the beating, are not
talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have classified this as a homicide,'' said Elizabeth Hirst,
a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which
investigates suspicious deaths in the state prison system. ``We
don't know exactly how many people took part in the killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdez was, according to prison and criminal records, one of the
most violent residents of what is called the X-wing _ a long
corridor lined with tiny cells that dead-ends at the state's
execution chamber _ in the maximum security prison in Starke, in
northern Florida. It only houses murderers like Valdez, 36, who are
moved from place to place in chains.
</P>
<P>
   But the violent nature of Valdez's own death, and the refusal by
the prison guards to cooperate with the investigation, has prompted
the FBI to join a state investigation that widened this week to
include complaints of brutality in prisons throughout the system.
</P>
<P>
   The homicide investigation has not led to criminal charges so
far but has resulted in suspensions _ with pay _ of the nine prison
guards and two other corrections officers who have refused to
cooperate with investigators. The investigation has been stymied by
that silence, said state investigators _ 12 of them in all _ who
are working from a command post set up outside the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 guards suspended, nine are believed to be directly
involved, said C.J. Drake, director of public affairs for the
Florida Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' Drake said, ``this appears to be an isolated
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucia Ross, the press secretary to Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida,
said Wednesday that ``it's a little premature to come to any
conclusions that there's any widespread problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But the killing has lent credibility to a drumbeat of complaints
by inmates of brutalities in Florida's 53-prison system. Those
complaints _ usually in the form of unsolicited letters to the
courts, reporters and lawyers _ are often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   One letter, from a prisoner on X-wing received by The Miami
Herald on July 15, two days before Valdez was killed, was eerily
similar to the picture investigators paint of his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sounds of prisoners screaming in pain and of bodies being
beaten keeps the inmates on the entire wing up all night,'' wrote
Mike Lambrix, a convicted murderer in X-wing, in a letter dated
July 6. ``I can hear the officers forcibly take inmates from their
cells. The wretched sound of fists and boots striking flesh are
unmistakable as is the sound of some kind of weapon (a stick or a
broom handle?) being used. They scream. They whimper. Then there is
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to get the feds in here,'' he continued, ``to
stop this before someone gets killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hirst said investigators are now looking at other such
complaints that were made both before and after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just caution you that there's two sides to every
story,'' Drake said. ``The Valdez incident has created an
atmosphere in which prisoners feel they can rehash a lot of
allegations against the prison system.'' In many cases, he added,
``we did investigate them and found that they are without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Rubin, a lawyer who is representing the Valdez family,
said the family wants the federal authorities to take over the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Florida investigating itself is like the fox
guarding the chicken coop,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators will be following up on those complaints
as part of the broader investigation, Florida officials said,
leaving state investigators free to concentrate on the homicide. A
few inmates from X-wing who may have seen or heard the attack have
been moved to another part of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, state prison officials announced that they would
videotape the removal of violent inmates from their cells _ what
the officials term ``extractions''_ to avoid speculation about what
actually happens, Drake said. State officials have been considering
the taping for some time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valdez incident merely accelerated our decision,'' Drake
said. ``But I wouldn't take it as a sign that we have a lack of
confidence in our prison guards.''
</P>
<P>
   If such a system had been in place, it would have shown what
happened that morning to Valdez, who has been in and out of prison
since 1980 for violently resisting a police officer, burglary,
robbery, kidnapping and grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, while trying to help another prisoner escape from
Glades Correctional Institution, Valdez shot to death Fred Griffis,
a corrections officer. A Palm Beach County Circuit Court sentenced
him to die.
</P>
<P>
   His death warrant had not yet been signed by Bush when the
extraction team of five officers, along with other officers, came
to remove him so they could search for weapons or other contraband.
Prison officials said the search was triggered when he had
threatened to kill a guard.
</P>
<P>
   The guards, armed with stun guns, fought with Valdez, who was,
from the results of a medical examination, struck and kicked
several times, investigators said. He was then placed in a cell,
without medical attention for several hours, and pronounced dead
later that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The corrections officers' union has said the men were just doing
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The officers suspended in the incident are Capt. Timothy Alvin
Thornton, 33; Sgt. Montrez Lazort Lucas, 30; Sgt. Charles Austin
Brown, 25; Sgt. Andrew William Lewis, 28; Sgt. Jason Patrick
Griffis, 26; Sgt. Robert William Sauls, and officers Dewey Marce
Beck, 51, Donald Michael Stanford, 51, and Raymon C. Hanson. The
two officers suspended this week were Daren Patgett, 34, and Philip
Maddox, 26. Griffis is no relation to the slain guard.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently handed the prison system over to Michael Moore,
who had a reputation as a tough jailer as head of the South
Carolina prison system. Moore ordered a review in January of the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
   Prison watchdog groups have lashed out at the Florida prison
system after the death. No matter how violent Valdez was, they say,
it was wrong to mirror his actions with even greater violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brutality and violence are not a legitimate response to
criminal conduct,'' said Jamie Fellner, associate counsel for Human
Rights Watch, based in New York. ``You can't fight crime with
crime.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A LONG VIEW TO OCTOBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a day off that he didn't really want, Mike Piazza
said the best thing about it was that he could admit they really
didn't need him. The infielders banged the ball all around and out
of Shea Stadium, combined for six runs batted in and vacuumed the
ground balls Kenny Rogers was throwing at the Pittsburgh Pirates
across six one-hit innings. After Dennis Cook lost Rogers' lead in
the eighth, the Mets cleared their throats, ran seven men around
the bases and posted a 9-2 victory for the Braves to stare at all
night in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This was, for Piazza, more summertime evidence that he made the
right play when he refused to re-commit himself to a once-proud
baseball organization now in the clutches of Homer Simpson. Had
Piazza taken the Dodgers' millions in a contract extension last
season, he knows he now would be a natural scapegoat in the middle
of their lineup, the proverbial superstar who puts up numbers but
doesn't win.
</P>
<P>
   These reputations typically have far more to do with location
than reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my best games this season we didn't win and some of
the games I've done nothing, we've won,'' Piazza was saying, across
the clubhouse from where Rogers was Wednesday's story du jour.
``But that's the sign of a real team, one that isn't living and
dying on one or two guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't basketball, where one or two players can determine
the destiny of a team. I don't mean that you need three or four
superstars to win. But look at any team that's won the World Series
_ they've had a whole group of battle-worthy players who aren't
susceptible to changes in sentiment, blue-collar ballplayers.
That's what I really like about this club, the overall balance. The
quality of the infield, the depth of the bullpen. Everyone feels
some importance, some sense of contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait long enough, and you are likely to hear a similar speech
from Barry Sanders sometime during the coming National Football
League season.
</P>
<P>
   It's entirely possible that Sanders is serious about retiring,
but the more likely explanation about his landing in London on
Wednesday is that he wants a change from Detroit's culture of
mediocrity and, like most athletes, has contrived the most
melodramatic means of getting it. If he does want to play, the NFL
would be crazy not to bend its salary cap rules to facilitate a
trade. Of course, there will be the usual cries of disloyalty and
selfishness, but the concept of a superstar getting himself traded
is not new, and at least Sanders can say he gave 10 years, his best
years, to the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar forced the Milwaukee Bucks to trade him to
the Lakers. John Elway refused to play for the Baltimore Colts.
Wayne Gretzky sure had a knack for winding up in a more promising
situation when the previous one soured. Sooner or later, the great
ones understand they have imperial leverage and decide to use it.
Is this right? Sorry, but it sure becomes difficult to hold players
to a higher ethical or contractual standard while market-hopping
sports team owners get away with much worse.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Piazza did not have to retire to get his wish,
unless you count the week he spent in Florida with the Marlins
before being shipped North to New York. The Mets gave him $91
million last winter, spent a combined $64 million on Al Leiter and
Robin Ventura, signed Rickey Henderson, and stole Armando Benitez
from the Bird-brains in Baltimore and Roger Cedeno from the
Simpsons out west. It was thus startling to hear people say
recently that the Mets needed to make an impact trade for the
stretch run, as if last winter's moves and money did not already
demonstrate their commitment to win.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of trading a young arm like Octavio Dotel for a
35-year-old pitcher like David Wells was downright preposterous.
With Rogers, Bobby Valentine has six fairly dependable starters,
not counting Bobby Jones. With the likelihood of a trade for
another relief pitcher and John Franco on the mend, Valentine could
have baseball's best bullpen by September.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who was supposed to be afraid of New York, said on
Wednesday that he and his wife have taken an apartment in
Manhattan. Piazza sat on the bench and watched the former Yankee
fit snugly into Shea, with 12 of his 18 outs recorded by the Mets'
superb infield. It all looked very planned, very professional, as
the Mets won their 61st game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early, two months to go, so we're keeping this in
perspective,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   His personal perspective on Wednesday from the dugout was the
developing realization that the Mets are evolving from a collection
of players to a team for October. Why wouldn't Barry Sanders want
this, too? &QL;

-- The typical hot water heater is a self-contained appliance that
works automatically. Unless the unit malfunctions, most homeowners
rarely give it a second thought. Most hot water heaters last about
10 years, but this life span can often be extended if the unit is
properly cared for. An annual inspection followed by a little
routine maintenance can often keep your hot water heater
functioning properly. (Edward R. Lipinski/New York Times

Massachusetts is known for nothing if not its historic figures. But

bands, many of whom pass themselves off as originals, amounts to
blatant musical plagiarism. (Jonathan Wiggs/Boston Globe Photo)

WAC AIMING TO SHOW IT'S A VIABLE CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Western Athletic Conference will conduct its first football
media day in its reduced form Thursday when the eight remaining
members gather at the Harvey Hotel near Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstructed league launches itself with new hope, a new
direction, and new problems _ but there is little doubt about the
No. 1 priority of the moment: presenting itself to the world in
some sort of identifiable form.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Rice athletic director Bobby May put it recently, ``I
think the main thing we need to do is get this eight-team
conference out in front of the public and let people know who we
are. I imagine there are a lot of people out there right now who
are a little confused about it, or who maybe think that the WAC
doesn't exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The WAC exists as a league that includes TCU, SMU, Rice, Tulsa,
UT-El Paso, Fresno State, San Jose State and Hawaii. Nevada is
scheduled to begin competition as a ninth member next season. The
league recently cleared one of its most crucial post-breakup
hurdles by negotiating a television contract with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little thin on guaranteed revenue, but as commissioner
Karl Benson has said, it offers the one thing the WAC desperately
needs: visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us the one thing we need most right now _ an
opportunity to display our product before the public,'' Benson
said. ``Now it's up to us to market it in such a way as to ensure
the future success of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   If a dog-and-cat fight for the league title is any sort of
marketing benefit, the WAC may be sitting on a gold mine. The
preseason favorite, depending on the poll, is TCU, SMU, Rice or
Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe we have a legitimate chance to win the
championship this year,'' SMU coach Mike Cavan said. ``But I think
pretty much everyone else feels the same way.'' nn

U.S. SUES MORGAN STANLEY IN SEX BIAS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than a dozen years, Allison K. Schieffelin
was on Wall Street's fast track. One of a small number of women who
specialize in selling exotic financial products, Ms. Schieffelin
thrived at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, one of the finance
industry's most respected firms. She took home well in excess of $1
million each year. She felt certain she would became a managing
director, the equivalent of partner.
</P>
<P>
   All that began to unravel a few years ago. Ms. Schieffelin
claimed that her exclusion from male-only events, like golf outings
and visits to Manhattan strip clubs, hurt her chances of bonding
with top executives. She was passed over when she first became
eligible to become a managing director in late 1996. She was
bypassed in 1997 as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, her boss made it plain that she would
probably never be promoted, telling her that ``not everyone gets
managing director.'' Men who contributed less to the firm were
promoted, according to a recounting of her views, available in
legal documents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schieffelin's claims are so far untested in court. But the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has launched a sweeping
investigation into Morgan Stanley's pay and promotion policies as
they affect women. The commission's decision seems likely to make
Ms. Schieffelin's complaint a test case of what some women have
called Wall Street's glass ceiling, an invisible barrier that they
say blocks even the most successful female bankers and traders from
the top executive jobs in finance.
</P>
<P>
   To file a sex discrimination lawsuit, an individual first has to
apply to the EEOC. At some point, the agency could either sue on
her behalf or free her to file her own lawsuit in court.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the EEOC took Morgan Stanley to U.S. District
Court in New York, seeking to force the firm to release information
the agency has been seeking as part of its investigation. The
action came after Morgan Stanley failed to comply with a subpoena
from the federal authority that sought data on its promotion and
compensation policies. The commission is now seeking a court order
forcing Morgan Stanley to turn over all of the subpoenaed
information. That court filing made public a discrimination charge
filed with the commission by Ms. Schieffelin late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her complaint, which still has not been filed publicly, also
alleges that Morgan Stanley retaliated against her after the firm
learned that she was contemplating a discrimination lawsuit.
Seeking to prevent Ms. Schieffelin from filing a lawsuit in court,
Morgan Stanley took peremptory action against her in an industry
arbitration forum, effectively suing one of its own employees
before she had filed any kind of complaint. The maneuver failed
when the arbitration board of the New York Stock Exchange rejected
Morgan Stanley's efforts to force the matter into arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The charge of acting aggressively when confronted with a
complaint by an employee echoes some allegations raised in an
unrelated racial discrimination lawsuit filed against Morgan
Stanley by a dismissed black employee, Christian Curry. The firm's
actions in the Curry case _ Morgan Stanley secretly paid a police
informant involved in arranging a sting operation against the
ex-employee _ prompted an investigation by the Manhattan district
attorney earlier this year. That investigation has since been
dropped and charges were never filed; prosecutors said they
concluded the firm had exercised poor judgment but did not have
criminal intent.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission's court filing makes clear that Morgan
Stanley objected to the commission's subpoena on the grounds that
it was overly broad in seeking more information than might be
necessary to determine whether the firm discriminated against Ms.
Schieffelin. The court filing also recounts a Morgan Stanley
argument that it was concerned that by complying with a request to
supply home phone numbers and addresses for its employees would
invade their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The commission says in the same filing that its request for
information from Morgan Stanley is justified given the fact that it
is examining whether or not there is a pattern of discrimination at
the firm.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Morgan Stanley said that the firm conducted an
internal investigation that found Ms. Schieffelin's charges of
discrimination to be without merit. This person also defended
Morgan Stanley's peremptory legal action against Ms. Schieffelin as
a prudent step to protect the firm against baseless lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Carleton Fiorina, Hewlett-Packard's new chief executive, may
have declared last week that the glass ceiling is a thing of the
past. But women have complained about discrimination on Wall Street
for years, claiming that the finance industry has a culture of
machismo that tends to exclude women. In recent years women have
filed class-action lawsuits against Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, attracting attention from
the media, civil-rights groups and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schieffelin's case is a bit unusual, however, in part
because she remains at the firm. As a senior saleswoman in the
convertible bond department, Ms. Schieffelin, 38, manages client
accounts and has in recent years played a prominent role in
recruiting business school graduates to work at Morgan Stanley. She
has also been paid like a star, earning $1.35 million in salary and
bonus in 1998, and $1.25 million the year before. Some men in the
department who have worked at the firm for a similar amount of time
did not take home as much, said her lawyer, Wayne Outten.
</P>
<P>
   ``She intends to stay there. She is trying to reform the
institution,'' Outten said. ``Someone has to speak up, and who
better than someone like Allie, who has an impeccable record.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schieffelin declined to comment on her complaint. Her lawyer
cited Morgan Stanley's strictly enforced rules that prohibit
employees from speaking to the media without authorization.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Boston College and Kellogg Graduate School of
Management at Northwestern University, Ms. Schieffelin began her
career at Morgan Stanley in 1986 and never left. Outten said she
was the ``archetypal Morgan Stanley person,'' committed to do
whatever it took to advance at the firm as the highest priority in
her life. Ms. Schieffelin, who is divorced, has no children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the top ``producers,'' or income-producing salespeople,
in convertible bonds, Ms. Schieffelin claims credit in her EEOC
complaint for helping develop a new online system for tracking
prices of convertible bonds that are not traded on exchanges. She
also helped to develop ``Road Show Link,'' a way to broadcast
investment banking sales tours on the Internet for people who
cannot attend in person.
</P>
<P>
   Outten said his client was the No. 1 ranked salesperson for a
custom convertible bond product that was highly touted by Morgan
Stanley in 1996, the first year she became eligible for promotion
to managing director. He said her performance reviews, as well as
her salary, gave every indication that she was a top performer
destined for promotion. When she was denied promotion, Morgan
Stanley effectively capped her salary, Outten said, adding that
managing directors in her department are believed to make in excess
of $3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Morgan Stanley disputes Ms. Schieffelin's
description of her performance at the firm. This person, who
declined to be identified further, said Ms. Schieffelin was a
middle-ranking salesperson. This person also said that bosses and
colleagues wrote in their reviews of her performance that she was
not a team player, a key criterion for managing directors.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Things began to go wrong for Ms. Schieffelin in 1995, her
complaint claims, when she filed internal sexual harassment charges
against a superior. The complaint says that Morgan Stanley
responded promptly to her charge and handled it properly but that
her career suffered thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   In her complaint, she said she was excluded from events that
were bonding opportunities for men at the firm and valuable chances
to develop relationships with key clients. She cited a five-day
annual golf outing in Doral, Fla., to which clients of hers were
invited but she was not. Male colleagues in her department also
took her clients to men's clubs like Scores in Manhattan, sometimes
without her knowledge, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schieffelin also recounted in her complaint that a boss once
told her that she was ``snippy'' during tense trading situations.
Ms. Schieffelin said that men in the department who exhibited the
same characteristics would be praised for being aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Ms. Schieffelin's claims
or the commission's lawsuit Wednesday. A spokesperson said that the
firm has a long track record of promoting women and minorities and
prides itself on having a diverse work force.

properly cared for. An annual inspection followed by a little
routine maintenance can often keep your hot water heater
functioning properly. (Edward R. Lipinski/New York Times

since the time of the Constitution. Just because there's a new
technological advancement doesn't change things in any way.''

 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A quarter-century ago, when Richard A. Rosenblatt was
first developing his skills as a trader on the floor of the New
York Stock Exchange, it was widely predicted that the Big Board's
days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed commissions were banned in May 1975, plunging Wall Street
into a frenzy of competition for customer trades. As trading fees
shrank, dozens of less efficient brokerage firms closed their
doors. With member firms dropping away, the price of an exchange
seat even dropped as low as $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenblatt's eyes shine when he remembers those fearsome
days. ``For a young entrepreneur, the opportunities just
exploded,'' he said. With prices suddenly within his reach, he was
able to borrow money and buy a seat on the exchange in 1979; it
became the cornerstone of the institutional trading firm that bears
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Today, skeptics are once again predicting the demise of the Big
Board. Its trading floor in lower Manhattan is no match, they say,
for the new computer-driven systems that are attracting a growing
share of the trading that traditionally has been done on the
exchange and its archrival, the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, Rosenblatt is optimistic. ``This game is for the
New York Stock Exchange to lose,'' he said confidently last week,
on the eve of the exchange's confirmation that it hopes to
transform itself into a for-profit corporation with public
shareholders before the end of the year. ``They've got it _ they've
got a better product for the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the New York exchange and its chief executive,
Richard A. Grasso, search for a survival strategy, Wall Street's
central symbol faces a daunting array of challenges. The exchange
must protect its franchise and find a way to blend the best aspects
of its floor-based auction system with the speed and the capacity
that only computers can provide. It must become more cost-efficient
without becoming less careful about policing its business _ a
challenge of such public importance that Arthur Levitt, chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, warned Grasso earlier this
week that regulatory competence will be the make-or-break issue
when the commission reviews his plans.
</P>
<P>
   And, as a public company, the Big Board must figure out how to
make money doing all this _ enough money to placate potentially
impatient shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt has a personal stake in how well the exchange fends
off its new competitors. ``I need an environment where I can make a
difference to my customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Big Board has lost only about 5 percent of its
trading volume to the electronic communications networks, or ECNs,
that have gobbled up nearly 30 percent of the Nasdaq market's
volume.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping a grip on its primary business is likely to be more
of a challenge for the Big Board in the future than it has been in
the past. In recent weeks, the New York exchange has liberalized
its Rule 500, which prevented companies from withdrawing from the
exchange without their shareholders' approval. Now, companies can
withdraw merely by obtaining the approval of their independent
directors.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind this change was that more companies would be
willing to list on the Big Board in the first place if it was
easier for them to leave. But the practical effects may simply be
that it is easier to move elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Another bellwether is the fate of Rule 390, which requires
members of the exchange to trade all Big Board stocks that were
listed before April 1979 only on a registered stock exchange, most
likely to be the Big Board itself during the hours the exchange is
open.
</P>
<P>
   The rule now affects only about a third of the Big Board stocks,
its supporters point out. But if this rule falls _ and the Nasdaq
market has been muttering for years about challenging it _ the New
York exchange could soon find that more of its trading volume has
moved to other markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board's fabled liquidity _ a volume of trading so deep
that large blocks of stock can be traded quickly without a dramatic
impact on prices _ is a key element of its premier ``brand.'' A
migration of trading volume to competing trading systems would not
only reduce its revenues, it would also undermine the value of that
brand.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical issue _ the real dollars-and-cents issue
for the Big Board,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law
professor at Columbia University and a member of the legal advisory
committees for both the Nasdaq market and the Big Board. ``It's a
key part of their franchise, and I cannot see them liberalizing it,
especially as they move to become public.''
</P>
<P>
   But Benn Steil, a senior fellow for foreign economic policy on
the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, argues that the
elimination of Rule 390 would simply increase the healthy pressure
on the exchange to create a trading structure that people want,
rather than one they are required to use.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Big Board may have no choice but to live
without the protections of Rule 390. ``I can't imagine that it can
remain in place,'' he said. ``It is such an anomaly, with so many
competitive pressures arguing against it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable speculation that the New York exchange
will be able to increase revenues by making strategic acquisitions
_ perhaps buying one of the upstart ECNs, or purchasing one of the
for-profit stock exchanges that are proliferating abroad, or buying
a company that develops innovative software for trading services.
</P>
<P>
   But for the near-term, the Big Board will most likely make its
money the old-fashioned way: by charging fees for companies to list
on the exchange and for investors to trade there. And in today's
competitive environment, both listing fees and trading fees ``are
going to be under competitive pressures,'' Steil said.
</P>
<P>
   To cope, he said, ``they need to bring their costs down.''
</P>
<P>
   Steil believes that cost pressures in competition will force the
exchange to abandon the expensive trading floor _ a trading
environment that Rosenblatt insists is the symbol of the exchange
and ``the envy of the world'' _ and replace it with an electronic
trading system.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt disagrees. ``You don't want to automate the
auction,'' he insisted, arguing that the relationships and
reputations of individual floor traders allow them to get better
prices for their customers. ``But you sure want to automate
everything around it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Either option requires money, of course. And the need to pay for
swift and dramatic improvements in technology will increase the
pressure on the Big Board to curtail its other costs.
</P>
<P>
   And that raises questions about whether the exchange will be
able to produce profits for its new shareholders and still
adequately pay for its self-policing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that already faces the for-profit ECNs that elect
to compete with the Big Board and the Nasdaq market by becoming
full-fledged stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allow the ECNs to become exchanges, regulating
themselves, you are inevitably going to have scandals,'' Coffee
said. Under pressure to produce profits, the for-profit exchanges
may well ``start to shop for the cheapest and the least, shall we
say, `intrusive' regulator,'' he continued. ``If that trend
accelerates, you've got a race to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt, the SEC chairman, wants to prevent that race from
starting.
</P>
<P>
   He offered one suggestion in his first response on Monday to the
idea of allowing for-profit stock trading entities: ``More formally
separating the self-regulatory role from the role of exchanges as
trading venues.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what the National Association of Securities
Dealers is planning if it proceeds with a proposal to spin off the
Nasdaq market as a for-profit corporation early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the scheme that Grasso outlined for the exchange
last week. Instead, he envisions retaining the exchange's
regulatory operation within the new for-profit company.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee worries that in-house regulators would be vulnerable to
cost-cutting pressures. His concern is shared by James J. Needham,
a former SEC commissioner who was the first paid chairman of the
New York Stock Exchange, from August 1972 to May 1976.
</P>
<P>
   With for-profit exchanges, ``there is the potential for serious
conflicts of interest,'' Needham said. ``We cannot rely on
self-regulation anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Don, a securities lawyer in Chicago with wide experience
in advising newly public companies, was less concerned about an
erosion of regulatory efforts. ``You just have to have sanctions
sufficiently strong that noncompliance becomes uncompetitive
behavior,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, the veteran floor trader, has heard the various
arguments, and said that he did not think members of the exchange
care where the regulators hung their hats. ``We just care that
regulation is not so cumbersome that you can't function, and that
regulators understand the difference between jaywalking and
premeditated murder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Needham, the former New York exchange chairman, said that the
changes in ownership structure now being contemplated by the Big
Board and the Nasdaq market are so dramatic that the SEC ought to
hold public hearings before approving either proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing would be for the public to lose confidence
because they don't understand what's happening,'' Needham said.
``Before we take the next step, let's find out what we're really
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, staring down at the unstylish side-laced shoes that
cushion his feet during long days on the trading floor, wondered
aloud whether anyone could truly assess where the changes of today
will leave the markets of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone to think that, five years from now, any of us will
be doing business the way we do today would be dangerously naive,''
he said. ``You show me a better way to trade, and I won't trade one
more share on the NYSE. But nobody's shown me that yet.''

 By LAURA MARTINEZ RUIZ-VELASCO 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Between Gutierrez and De La Guerra streets, a
dozen shops sell everything from sarapes, and spinning tops to
tamarind ice cream and Canals chewing gum. In the background you
can hear the music of the Regios del Norte.
 &HT;    A huge sign says: ``Order Your Fiesta Dress Now!'' Meanwhile on
the street, for every American flag waving on the street there's a
Mexican flag. No, we are not on the border, but in the California
tourist city of Santa Barbara, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles,
where people are preparing to celebrate the great fiesta of the
Cinco de Mayo.
 &HT;    Cinco de Mayo? ``Yes! It's Independence Day in Mexico, it means
the Fifth of May you know? Like the Fourth of July is for us,''
says a friendly American teenager working for Borders Bookstore.
 &HT;    Mexican independence? Not quite. It is simply the anniversary of
the Battle of Puebla, which took place in 1862 between Napoleon
III's French troops and a peasant Mexican army. Historic details
aside, what matters is that Cinco de Mayo is becoming a symbol of
Mexican culture north of the Rio Grande, and not just in California
but in other states as well. The U.S. Post Office has even issued a
commemorative stamp.
 &HT;    ``I think Cinco de Mayo is becoming more and more popular in the
U.S. It's sort of like the St. Patrick's Day of the next
millennium,'' says Pete Hamill, a Brooklyn-born author who divides
his time between Mexico and New York.
 &HT;    Mexican culture, once considered part of a tiny ethnic market,
is becoming part of the U.S. mainstream. Everything that smells of
Mexico _ from food, beer, music or national holidays _ is selling
like hotcakes. ``Mexico is recovering its lost territory
gastronomically,'' says Carlos Monsivais, a well-known Mexican
author.
 &HT;    To get a sense of how the U.S. consumer is assimilating, one
need only look at the changes in eating habits: at what is selling
on supermarket shelves and at the latest hot restaurants in large
cities. Mexican food is packing them in.
 &HT;    ``Food is the way Americans start to experience other
cultures,'' says Hamill. ``It started with Italian; then Americans
discovered some Jewish and German foods, and now it's Mexican and
that's because every day hay mas y mas mexicanos! (there are more
and more Mexicans!)''
 &HT;    True enough. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 59 percent of
the 30 million Hispanics living in the U.S. are of Mexican origin.
By the year 2010, there will be an estimated 41.5 million Hispanics
in the U.S., 25.6 million of them Mexican.
 &HT;    ``The Mexican presence is growing not just in California, Texas
and New York, but also in places like Minnesota and Michigan, where
no one ever imagined there could be a significant Mexican
population,'' says Andrew Erlich, head of market research firm
Erlich Transcultural Consultant. He concludes: ``We're talking
about something deeper, from lifestyle to food to dance and
music.''
 &HT;    More and more, those checking out Mexican food are not
necessarily Hispanic. The typical U.S. consumer discovered long ago
that Mexican food is more than the familiar Tex-Mex. The American
stomach is quickly becoming used to the exotic flavors brought by
immigrants who come to stay. It is no coincidence, say many, that
at least when it comes to fast food, tacos have begun to take the
place of hamburgers among the younger set, not to mention spicy
salsa, which is leaving the traditional ketchup in the dust.
 &HT;    ``Americans are getting to know Mexican food. Not only are they
familiar with mole poblano, they can tell the difference between a
good mole poblano and a not-so-good one,'' says Gregorio Camarillo
proudly. Camarillo is an employee at The Gardens of Taxco, a
Mexican restaurant in the heart of Hollywood frequented by the
likes of Janet Jackson, Charles Bronson, Dolly Parton and Quentin
Tarantino.
 &HT;    Dave DeWitt, editor of Fiery Foods Magazine, an Albuquerque,
N.M. publication dedicated to spicy food, says Americans have
realized that hot peppers are no longer exotic, and they're
learning to like them. The reason, DeWitt says, is simple: Shifting
immigration patterns. ``A hundred years ago, we were Europeans. Now
we are becoming more Latin, though spicy food is certainly not
exclusive to Mexicans. Indian and Thai dishes are hot, too. But it
was definitely Mexicans who led the way,'' says DeWitt, adding:
``Spicy food is now part of life in the U.S., and not only in
states like California, Texas or New Mexico it's all over the
place.''
 &HT;    Americans have learned to eat Mexican food, but the preference
toward low or no-fat foods has made it necessary to play around
with some traditional recipes. You can find fat-free pozole, light
enchilada sauce, soy chorizo sausage or non-fat tortillas in U.S.
supermarkets, creating a neither-here-nor-there cuisine.
 &HT;    The changes are not limited to food. Although it is no longer
news that Corona is the number one imported beer in the United
States, American beer drinkers now brag of their sophisticated
ways.
 &HT;    That's because they have a lot to choose from. According to New
York market research firm Beverage Marketing Corporation, of the 30
top imported beers in the United States, seven are from Mexico.
Corona is number one, followed by Tecate, Dos Equis, Modelo
Especial, Corona Light, Pacifico and Negra Modelo. And while
Canadian beers are experiencing a marked decrease in volume of U.S.
sales, Mexican beers are growing at an annual 40 percent rate. By
comparison, Heineken, once the number one import, is growing at a
5.3 percent yearly clip.
 &HT;    Among spirits, tequila is charging ahead at a torrid pace in
import growth, variety, and consumption in the United States. Even
though average alcohol consumption has been steadily decreasing
over the past few years, tequila has been an exception. Its
consumption has doubled since 1985, to 15.7 million gallons in
1998.
 &HT;    Tequila ``is one of the most robust spirits category in the
United States,'' says Lisa Hawkins, spokeswoman for the Distilled
Spirits Council, based in Washington, D.C. ``And I can tell you
that across the country, all restaurants and bars are increasing
their selection of tequila.''
 &HT;    For many Mexicans, the liquor store and supermarket shelves
offer genuine novelties, with little-known brands such as Two
Fingers, Montezuma, Don Cesar Monterrey, Jarana and Puerto
Vallarta, some selling for as much as $60 a bottle. Tequila has
surpassed its reputation as a vulgar drink associated with Mexican
bandits to become something a lot more chic.
 &HT;    ``Tequila is cutting across a broad spectrum,'' says Chris
Klinefelter, spokesman for Brown-Forman, a U.S. firm that announced
a deal with Jalisco-based Tequila Orendain to distribute its
premium tequila brands worldwide. Although some attribute the
growth in tequila drinking to excellent marketing, the trend has
legs: Tequila sales grew 31 percent between 1994 and 1998, to reach
$1.56 billion.
 &HT;    Music is also getting big. Sales of Latin music in the U.S. grew
16 percent in 1998 to $571 million. Though its sales volume is a
small 4.1 percent of the huge $13.7 billion music market, it does
reflect the growing passion for things Latin, according to the
Recording Industry Association of America.
 &HT;    Even though in most of the U.S. Latin American music is
associated with Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin, Chicana performer
Selena or Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan, many Mexican bands
and performers are slowly finding their way into the mainstream.
``Music is another way Americans absorb and get the feeling of a
culture,'' says Hamill. He tells a story about one of his recent
visits to New York, where he was surprised to find standing-room
only at Luis Miguel concerts at Radio City Music Hall. The biggest
irony is the Mexican crooner's show featured songs from the 1950s.
Says Hamill: ``Agustin Lara was given to us new!''
 &HT;    Another new face in the U.S. music scene is Alejandro Fernandez,
son of famed Mexican singing charro Vicente Fernandez. The groups
Mana and Cafe Tacuba are making headway in pop and rock music,
while others, not yet as popular, are just beginning to make
themselves known.
 &HT;    ``I would say Thalia is close, but not quite there yet,'' says
Erick Sorensen, a Miami businessman who imports and sells Mexican
furniture and crafts nationwide. ``I'd say Mexican music is larger
than the actual Mexican population in Miami,'' says Sorensen.
Mexicans make up a small part of the immigrant population in
Florida's Cuban stronghold. For skeptics such as Marcelo Salup,
vice-president of advertising agency Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding,
``Mexican things just don't exist here [in Miami. The only thing
Mexican is Taco Bell, and if you ask a waiter for a Dos Equis,
he'll look at you as if you're speaking another language.''
 &HT;    Could be, but even Miami, which bills itself as the capital of
Latin America, is turning Mexican. Univision's Channel 23, the
local affiliate of the largest Spanish-language TV network in the
United States, leads the ratings in the area, beating out the
English-language stations. The majority of its programming
originates in Mexico, and the network itself is partly controlled
by Mexico-based Televisa.
 &HT;    Last year, for the second time in the center of the city,
Miamians celebrated September 15, the real Mexican Independence
Day. There were tacos, folk dances and tequila. Sorensen adds,
``Cinco de Mayo is becoming huge out here, even though there is a
very small Mexican population.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A quarter-century ago, when Richard A. Rosenblatt was
first developing his skills as a trader on the floor of the New
York Stock Exchange, it was widely predicted that the Big Board's
days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed commissions were banned in May 1975, plunging Wall Street
into a frenzy of competition for customer trades. As trading fees
shrank, dozens of less efficient brokerage firms closed their
doors. With member firms dropping away, the price of an exchange
seat even dropped as low as $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenblatt's eyes shine when he remembers those fearsome
days. ``For a young entrepreneur, the opportunities just
exploded,'' he said. With prices suddenly within his reach, he was
able to borrow money and buy a seat on the exchange in 1979; it
became the cornerstone of the institutional trading firm that bears
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Today, skeptics are once again predicting the demise of the Big
Board. Its trading floor in lower Manhattan is no match, they say,
for the new computer-driven systems that are attracting a growing
share of the trading that traditionally has been done on the
exchange and its archrival, the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, Rosenblatt is optimistic. ``This game is for the
New York Stock Exchange to lose,'' he said confidently last week,
on the eve of the exchange's confirmation that it hopes to
transform itself into a for-profit corporation with public
shareholders before the end of the year. ``They've got it _ they've
got a better product for the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the New York exchange and its chief executive,
Richard A. Grasso, search for a survival strategy, Wall Street's
central symbol faces a daunting array of challenges. The exchange
must protect its franchise and find a way to blend the best aspects
of its floor-based auction system with the speed and the capacity
that only computers can provide. It must become more cost-efficient
without becoming less careful about policing its business _ a
challenge of such public importance that Arthur Levitt, chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, warned Grasso earlier this
week that regulatory competence will be the make-or-break issue
when the commission reviews his plans.
</P>
<P>
   And, as a public company, the Big Board must figure out how to
make money doing all this _ enough money to placate potentially
impatient shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt has a personal stake in how well the exchange fends
off its new competitors. ``I need an environment where I can make a
difference to my customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Big Board has lost only about 5 percent of its
trading volume to the electronic communications networks, or ECNs,
that have gobbled up nearly 30 percent of the Nasdaq market's
volume.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping a grip on its primary business is likely to be more
of a challenge for the Big Board in the future than it has been in
the past. In recent weeks, the New York exchange has liberalized
its Rule 500, which prevented companies from withdrawing from the
exchange without their shareholders' approval. Now, companies can
withdraw merely by obtaining the approval of their independent
directors.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind this change was that more companies would be
willing to list on the Big Board in the first place if it was
easier for them to leave. But the practical effects may simply be
that it is easier to move elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Another bellwether is the fate of Rule 390, which requires
members of the exchange to trade all Big Board stocks that were
listed before April 1979 only on a registered stock exchange, most
likely to be the Big Board itself during the hours the exchange is
open.
</P>
<P>
   The rule now affects only about a third of the Big Board stocks,
its supporters point out. But if this rule falls _ and the Nasdaq
market has been muttering for years about challenging it _ the New
York exchange could soon find that more of its trading volume has
moved to other markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board's fabled liquidity _ a volume of trading so deep
that large blocks of stock can be traded quickly without a dramatic
impact on prices _ is a key element of its premier ``brand.'' A
migration of trading volume to competing trading systems would not
only reduce its revenues, it would also undermine the value of that
brand.

can hear the music of the Regios del Norte.
 &HT;    A huge sign says: ``Order Your Fiesta Dress Now!'' Meanwhile on
the street, for every American flag waving on the street there's a
Mexican flag. No, we are not on the border, but in the California
tourist city of Santa Barbara, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles,
where people are preparing to celebrate the great fiesta of the
Cinco de Mayo.
 &HT;    Cinco de Mayo? ``Yes! It's Independence Day in Mexico, it means
the Fifth of May you know? Like the Fourth of July is for us,''
says a friendly American teenager working for Borders Bookstore.
 &HT;    Mexican independence? Not quite. It is simply the anniversary of
the Battle of Puebla, which took place in 1862 between Napoleon
III's French troops and a peasant Mexican army. Historic details
aside, what matters is that Cinco de Mayo is becoming a symbol of
Mexican culture north of the Rio Grande, and not just in California
but in other states as well. The U.S. Post Office has even issued a
commemorative stamp.
 &HT;    ``I think Cinco de Mayo is becoming more and more popular in the
U.S. It's sort of like the St. Patrick's Day of the next
millennium,'' says Pete Hamill, a Brooklyn-born author who divides
his time between Mexico and New York.
 &HT;    Mexican culture, once considered part of a tiny ethnic market,
is becoming part of the U.S. mainstream. Everything that smells of
Mexico _ from food, beer, music or national holidays _ is selling
like hotcakes. ``Mexico is recovering its lost territory
gastronomically,'' says Carlos Monsivais, a well-known Mexican
author.
 &HT;    To get a sense of how the U.S. consumer is assimilating, one
need only look at the changes in eating habits: at what is selling
on supermarket shelves and at the latest hot restaurants in large
cities. Mexican food is packing them in.
 &HT;    ``Food is the way Americans start to experience other
cultures,'' says Hamill. ``It started with Italian; then Americans
discovered some Jewish and German foods, and now it's Mexican and
that's because every day hay mas y mas mexicanos! (there are more
and more Mexicans!)''
 &HT;    True enough. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 59 percent of
the 30 million Hispanics living in the U.S. are of Mexican origin.
By the year 2010, there will be an estimated 41.5 million Hispanics
in the U.S., 25.6 million of them Mexican.
 &HT;    ``The Mexican presence is growing not just in California, Texas
and New York, but also in places like Minnesota and Michigan, where
no one ever imagined there could be a significant Mexican
population,'' says Andrew Erlich, head of market research firm
Erlich Transcultural Consultant. He concludes: ``We're talking
about something deeper, from lifestyle to food to dance and
music.''
 &HT;    More and more, those checking out Mexican food are not
necessarily Hispanic. The typical U.S. consumer discovered long ago
that Mexican food is more than the familiar Tex-Mex. The American
stomach is quickly becoming used to the exotic flavors brought by
immigrants who come to stay. It is no coincidence, say many, that
at least when it comes to fast food, tacos have begun to take the
place of hamburgers among the younger set, not to mention spicy
salsa, which is leaving the traditional ketchup in the dust.
 &HT;    ``Americans are getting to know Mexican food. Not only are they
familiar with mole poblano, they can tell the difference between a
good mole poblano and a not-so-good one,'' says Gregorio Camarillo
proudly. Camarillo is an employee at The Gardens of Taxco, a
Mexican restaurant in the heart of Hollywood frequented by the
likes of Janet Jackson, Charles Bronson, Dolly Parton and Quentin
Tarantino.
 &HT;    Dave DeWitt, editor of Fiery Foods Magazine, an Albuquerque,
N.M. publication dedicated to spicy food, says Americans have
realized that hot peppers are no longer exotic, and they're
learning to like them. The reason, DeWitt says, is simple: Shifting
immigration patterns. ``A hundred years ago, we were Europeans. Now
we are becoming more Latin, though spicy food is certainly not
exclusive to Mexicans. Indian and Thai dishes are hot, too. But it
was definitely Mexicans who led the way,'' says DeWitt, adding:
``Spicy food is now part of life in the U.S., and not only in
states like California, Texas or New Mexico it's all over the
place.''
 &HT;    Americans have learned to eat Mexican food, but the preference
toward low or no-fat foods has made it necessary to play around
with some traditional recipes. You can find fat-free pozole, light
enchilada sauce, soy chorizo sausage or non-fat tortillas in U.S.
supermarkets, creating a neither-here-nor-there cuisine.
 &HT;    The changes are not limited to food. Although it is no longer
news that Corona is the number one imported beer in the United
States, American beer drinkers now brag of their sophisticated
ways.
 &HT;    That's because they have a lot to choose from. According to New
York market research firm Beverage Marketing Corporation, of the 30
top imported beers in the United States, seven are from Mexico.
Corona is number one, followed by Tecate, Dos Equis, Modelo
Especial, Corona Light, Pacifico and Negra Modelo. And while
Canadian beers are experiencing a marked decrease in volume of U.S.
sales, Mexican beers are growing at an annual 40 percent rate. By
comparison, Heineken, once the number one import, is growing at a
5.3 percent yearly clip.
 &HT;    Among spirits, tequila is charging ahead at a torrid pace in
import growth, variety, and consumption in the United States. Even
though average alcohol consumption has been steadily decreasing
over the past few years, tequila has been an exception. Its
consumption has doubled since 1985, to 15.7 million gallons in
1998.
 &HT;    Tequila ``is one of the most robust spirits category in the
United States,'' says Lisa Hawkins, spokeswoman for the Distilled
Spirits Council, based in Washington, D.C. ``And I can tell you
that across the country, all restaurants and bars are increasing
their selection of tequila.''
 &HT;    For many Mexicans, the liquor store and supermarket shelves
offer genuine novelties, with little-known brands such as Two
Fingers, Montezuma, Don Cesar Monterrey, Jarana and Puerto
Vallarta, some selling for as much as $60 a bottle. Tequila has
surpassed its reputation as a vulgar drink associated with Mexican
bandits to become something a lot more chic.
 &HT;    ``Tequila is cutting across a broad spectrum,'' says Chris
Klinefelter, spokesman for Brown-Forman, a U.S. firm that announced
a deal with Jalisco-based Tequila Orendain to distribute its
premium tequila brands worldwide. Although some attribute the
growth in tequila drinking to excellent marketing, the trend has
legs: Tequila sales grew 31 percent between 1994 and 1998, to reach
$1.56 billion.
 &HT;    Music is also getting big. Sales of Latin music in the U.S. grew
16 percent in 1998 to $571 million. Though its sales volume is a
small 4.1 percent of the huge $13.7 billion music market, it does
reflect the growing passion for things Latin, according to the
Recording Industry Association of America.
 &HT;    Even though in most of the U.S. Latin American music is
associated with Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin, Chicana performer
Selena or Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan, many Mexican bands
and performers are slowly finding their way into the mainstream.
``Music is another way Americans absorb and get the feeling of a
culture,'' says Hamill. He tells a story about one of his recent
visits to New York, where he was surprised to find standing-room
only at Luis Miguel concerts at Radio City Music Hall. The biggest
irony is the Mexican crooner's show featured songs from the 1950s.
Says Hamill: ``Agustin Lara was given to us new!''
 &HT;    Another new face in the U.S. music scene is Alejandro Fernandez,
son of famed Mexican singing charro Vicente Fernandez. The groups
Mana and Cafe Tacuba are making headway in pop and rock music,
while others, not yet as popular, are just beginning to make
themselves known.
 &HT;    ``I would say Thalia is close, but not quite there yet,'' says
Erick Sorensen, a Miami businessman who imports and sells Mexican
furniture and crafts nationwide. ``I'd say Mexican music is larger
than the actual Mexican population in Miami,'' says Sorensen.
Mexicans make up a small part of the immigrant population in
Florida's Cuban stronghold. For skeptics such as Marcelo Salup,
vice-president of advertising agency Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding,
``Mexican things just don't exist here [in Miami. The only thing
Mexican is Taco Bell, and if you ask a waiter for a Dos Equis,
he'll look at you as if you're speaking another language.''
 &HT;    Could be, but even Miami, which bills itself as the capital of
Latin America, is turning Mexican. Univision's Channel 23, the
local affiliate of the largest Spanish-language TV network in the
United States, leads the ratings in the area, beating out the
English-language stations. The majority of its programming
originates in Mexico, and the network itself is partly controlled
by Mexico-based Televisa.
 &HT;    Last year, for the second time in the center of the city,
Miamians celebrated September 15, the real Mexican Independence
Day. There were tacos, folk dances and tequila. Sorensen adds,
``Cinco de Mayo is becoming huge out here, even though there is a
very small Mexican population.''

 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Between Gutierrez and De La Guerra streets, a
dozen shops sell everything from sarapes, and spinning tops to
tamarind ice cream and Canals chewing gum. In the background you
can hear the music of the Regios del Norte.
 &HT;    A huge sign says: ``Order Your Fiesta Dress Now!'' Meanwhile on

 NEW YORK: that brand.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This is a critical issue _ the real dollars-and-cents issue
for the Big Board,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law
professor at Columbia University and a member of the legal advisory
committees for both the Nasdaq market and the Big Board. ``It's a
key part of their franchise, and I cannot see them liberalizing it,
especially as they move to become public.''
</P>
<P>
   But Benn Steil, a senior fellow for foreign economic policy on
the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, argues that the
elimination of Rule 390 would simply increase the healthy pressure
on the exchange to create a trading structure that people want,
rather than one they are required to use.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Big Board may have no choice but to live
without the protections of Rule 390. ``I can't imagine that it can
remain in place,'' he said. ``It is such an anomaly, with so many
competitive pressures arguing against it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable speculation that the New York exchange
will be able to increase revenues by making strategic acquisitions
_ perhaps buying one of the upstart ECNs, or purchasing one of the
for-profit stock exchanges that are proliferating abroad, or buying
a company that develops innovative software for trading services.
</P>
<P>
   But for the near-term, the Big Board will most likely make its
money the old-fashioned way: by charging fees for companies to list
on the exchange and for investors to trade there. And in today's
competitive environment, both listing fees and trading fees ``are
going to be under competitive pressures,'' Steil said.
</P>
<P>
   To cope, he said, ``they need to bring their costs down.''
</P>
<P>
   Steil believes that cost pressures in competition will force the
exchange to abandon the expensive trading floor _ a trading
environment that Rosenblatt insists is the symbol of the exchange
and ``the envy of the world'' _ and replace it with an electronic
trading system.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt disagrees. ``You don't want to automate the
auction,'' he insisted, arguing that the relationships and
reputations of individual floor traders allow them to get better
prices for their customers. ``But you sure want to automate
everything around it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Either option requires money, of course. And the need to pay for
swift and dramatic improvements in technology will increase the
pressure on the Big Board to curtail its other costs.
</P>
<P>
   And that raises questions about whether the exchange will be
able to produce profits for its new shareholders and still
adequately pay for its self-policing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that already faces the for-profit ECNs that elect
to compete with the Big Board and the Nasdaq market by becoming
full-fledged stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allow the ECNs to become exchanges, regulating
themselves, you are inevitably going to have scandals,'' Coffee
said. Under pressure to produce profits, the for-profit exchanges
may well ``start to shop for the cheapest and the least, shall we
say, `intrusive' regulator,'' he continued. ``If that trend
accelerates, you've got a race to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt, the SEC chairman, wants to prevent that race from
starting.
</P>
<P>
   He offered one suggestion in his first response on Monday to the
idea of allowing for-profit stock trading entities: ``More formally
separating the self-regulatory role from the role of exchanges as
trading venues.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what the National Association of Securities
Dealers is planning if it proceeds with a proposal to spin off the
Nasdaq market as a for-profit corporation early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the scheme that Grasso outlined for the exchange
last week. Instead, he envisions retaining the exchange's
regulatory operation within the new for-profit company.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee worries that in-house regulators would be vulnerable to
cost-cutting pressures. His concern is shared by James J. Needham,
a former SEC commissioner who was the first paid chairman of the
New York Stock Exchange, from August 1972 to May 1976.
</P>
<P>
   With for-profit exchanges, ``there is the potential for serious
conflicts of interest,'' Needham said. ``We cannot rely on
self-regulation anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Don, a securities lawyer in Chicago with wide experience
in advising newly public companies, was less concerned about an
erosion of regulatory efforts. ``You just have to have sanctions
sufficiently strong that noncompliance becomes uncompetitive
behavior,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, the veteran floor trader, has heard the various
arguments, and said that he did not think members of the exchange
care where the regulators hung their hats. ``We just care that
regulation is not so cumbersome that you can't function, and that
regulators understand the difference between jaywalking and
premeditated murder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Needham, the former New York exchange chairman, said that the
changes in ownership structure now being contemplated by the Big
Board and the Nasdaq market are so dramatic that the SEC ought to
hold public hearings before approving either proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing would be for the public to lose confidence
because they don't understand what's happening,'' Needham said.
``Before we take the next step, let's find out what we're really
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, staring down at the unstylish side-laced shoes that
cushion his feet during long days on the trading floor, wondered
aloud whether anyone could truly assess where the changes of today
will leave the markets of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone to think that, five years from now, any of us will
be doing business the way we do today would be dangerously naive,''
he said. ``You show me a better way to trade, and I won't trade one
more share on the NYSE. But nobody's shown me that yet.''

 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Between Gutierrez and De La Guerra streets, a
dozen shops sell everything from sarapes, and spinning tops to
tamarind ice cream and Canals chewing gum. In the background you
can hear the music of the Regios del Norte.
 &HT;    A huge sign says: ``Order Your Fiesta Dress Now!'' Meanwhile on
the street, for every American flag waving on the street there's a
Mexican flag. No, we are not on the border, but in the California
tourist city of Santa Barbara, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles,
where people are preparing to celebrate the great fiesta of the
Cinco de Mayo.
 &HT;    Cinco de Mayo? ``Yes! It's Independence Day in Mexico, it means
the Fifth of May you know? Like the Fourth of July is for us,''
says a friendly American teenager working for Borders Bookstore.
 &HT;    Mexican independence? Not quite. It is simply the anniversary of
the Battle of Puebla, which took place in 1862 between Napoleon
III's French troops and a peasant Mexican army. Historic details
aside, what matters is that Cinco de Mayo is becoming a symbol of
Mexican culture north of the Rio Grande, and not just in California
but in other states as well. The U.S. Post Office has even issued a
commemorative stamp.
 &HT;    ``I think Cinco de Mayo is becoming more and more popular in the
U.S. It's sort of like the St. Patrick's Day of the next
millennium,'' says Pete Hamill, a Brooklyn-born author who divides
his time between Mexico and New York.
 &HT;    Mexican culture, once considered part of a tiny ethnic market,
is becoming part of the U.S. mainstream. Everything that smells of
Mexico _ from food, beer, music or national holidays _ is selling
like hotcakes. ``Mexico is recovering its lost territory
gastronomically,'' says Carlos Monsivais, a well-known Mexican
author.
 &HT;    To get a sense of how the U.S. consumer is assimilating, one
need only look at the changes in eating habits: at what is selling
on supermarket shelves and at the latest hot restaurants in large
cities. Mexican food is packing them in.
 &HT;    ``Food is the way Americans start to experience other
cultures,'' says Hamill. ``It started with Italian; then Americans
discovered some Jewish and German foods, and now it's Mexican and
that's because every day hay mas y mas mexicanos! (there are more
and more Mexicans!)''
 &HT;    True enough. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 59 percent of
the 30 million Hispanics living in the U.S. are of Mexican origin.
By the year 2010, there will be an estimated 41.5 million Hispanics
in the U.S., 25.6 million of them Mexican.
 &HT;    ``The Mexican presence is growing not just in California, Texas
and New York, but also in places like Minnesota and Michigan, where
no one ever imagined there could be a significant Mexican
population,'' says Andrew Erlich, head of market research firm
Erlich Transcultural Consultant. He concludes: ``We're talking
about something deeper, from lifestyle to food to dance and
music.''
 &HT;    More and more, those checking out Mexican food are not
necessarily Hispanic. The typical U.S. consumer discovered long ago
that Mexican food is more than the familiar Tex-Mex. The American
stomach is quickly becoming used to the exotic flavors brought by
immigrants who come to stay. It is no coincidence, say many, that
at least when it comes to fast food, tacos have begun to take the
place of hamburgers among the younger set, not to mention spicy
salsa, which is leaving the traditional ketchup in the dust.
 &HT;    ``Americans are getting to know Mexican food. Not only are they
familiar with mole poblano, they can tell the difference between a
good mole poblano and a not-so-good one,'' says Gregorio Camarillo
proudly. Camarillo is an employee at he Gardens of Taxco, a
Mexican restaurant in the heart of Hollywood frequented by the
likes of Janet Jackson, Charles Bronson, Dolly Parton and Quentin
Tarantino.
 &HT;    Dave DeWitt, editor of Fiery Foods Magazine, an Albuquerque,
N.M. publication dedicated to spicy food, says Americans have
realized that hot peppers are no longer exotic, and they're
learning to like them. The reason, DeWitt says, is simple: Shifting
immigration patterns. ``A hundred years ago, we were Europeans. Now
we are becoming more Latin, though spicy food is certainly not
exclusive to Mexicans. Indian and Thai dishes are hot, too. But it
was definitely Mexicans who led the way,'' says DeWitt, adding:
``Spicy food is now part of life in the U.S., and not only in
states like California, Texas or New Mexico it's all over the
place.''
 &HT;    Americans have learned to eat Mexican food, but the preference
toward low or no-fat foods has made it necessary to play around
with some traditional recipes. You can find fat-free pozole, light
enchilada sauce, soy chorizo sausage or non-fat tortillas in U.S.
supermarkets, creating a neither-here-nor-there cuisine.
 &HT;    The changes are not limited to food. Although it is no longer
news that Corona is the number one imported beer in the United
States, American beer drinkers now brag of their sophisticated
ways.
 &HT;    That's because they have a lot to choose from. According to New
York market research firm Beverage Marketing Corporation, of the 30
top imported beers in the United States, seven are from Mexico.
Corona is number one, followed by Tecate, Dos Equis, Modelo
Especial, Corona Light, Pacifico and Negra Modelo. And while
Canadian beers are experiencing a marked decrease in volume of U.S.
sales, Mexican beers are growing at an annual 40 percent rate. By
comparison, Heineken, once the number one import, is growing at a
5.3 percent yearly clip.
 &HT;    Among spirits, tequila is charging ahead at a torrid pace in
import growth, variety, and consumption in the United States. Even
though average alcohol consumption has been steadily decreasing
over the past few years, tequila has been an exception. Its
consumption has doubled since 1985, to 15.7 million gallons in
1998.
 &HT;    Tequila ``is one of the most robust spirits category in the
United States,'' says Lisa Hawkins, spokeswoman for the Distilled
Spirits Council, based in Washington, D.C. ``And I can tell you
that across the country, all restaurants and bars are increasing
their selection of tequila.''
 &HT;    For many Mexicans, the liquor store and supermarket shelves
offer genuine novelties, with little-known brands such as Two
Fingers, Montezuma, Don Cesar Monterrey, Jarana and Puerto
Vallarta, some selling for as much as $60 a bottle. Tequila has
surpassed its reputation as a vulgar drink associated with Mexican
bandits to become something a lot more chic.
 &HT;    ``Tequila is cutting across a broad spectrum,'' says Chris
Klinefelter, spokesman for Brown-Forman, a U.S. firm that announced
a deal with Jalisco-based Tequila Orendain to distribute its
premium tequila brands worldwide. Although some attribute the
growth in tequila drinking to excellent marketing, the trend has
legs: Tequila sales grew 31 percent between 1994 and 1998, to reach
$1.56 billion.
 &HT;    Music is also getting big. Sales of Latin music in the U.S. grew
16 percent in 1998 to $571 million. Though its sales volume is a
small 4.1 percent of the huge $13.7 billion music market, it does
reflect the growing passion for things Latin, according to the
Recording Industry Association of America.
 &HT;    Even though in most of the U.S. Latin American music is
associated with Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin, Chicana performer
Selena or Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan, many Mexican bands
and performers are slowly finding their way into the mainstream.
``Music is another way Americans absorb and get the feeling of a
culture,'' says Hamill. He tells a story about one of his recent
visits to New York, where he was surprised to find standing-room
only at Luis Miguel concerts at Radio City Music Hall. The biggest
irony is the Mexican crooner's show featured songs from the 1950s.
Says Hamill: ``Agustin Lara was given to us new!''
 &HT;    Another new face in the U.S. music scene is Alejandro Fernandez,
son of famed Mexican singing charro Vicente Fernandez. The groups
Mana and Cafe Tacuba are making headway in pop and rock music,
while others, not yet as popular, are just beginning to make
themselves known.
 &HT;    ``I would say Thalia is close, but not quite there yet,'' says
Erick Sorensen, a Miami businessman who imports and sells Mexican
furniture and crafts nationwide. ``I'd say Mexican music is larger
than the actual Mexican population in Miami,'' says Sorensen.
Mexicans make up a small part of the immigrant population in
Florida's Cuban stronghold. For skeptics such as Marcelo Salup,
vice-president of advertising agency Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding,
``Mexican things just don't exist here [in Miami. The only thing
Mexican is Taco Bell, and if you ask a waiter for a Dos Equis,
he'll look at you as if you're speaking another language.''
 &HT;    Could be, but even Miami, which bills itself as the capital of
Latin America, is turning Mexican. Univision's Channel 23, the
local affiliate of the largest Spanish-language TV network in the
United States, leads the ratings in the area, beating out the
English-language stations. The majority of its programming
originates in Mexico, and the network itself is partly controlled
by Mexico-based Televisa.
 &HT;    Last year, for the second time in the center of the city,
Miamians celebrated September 15, the real Mexican Independence
Day. There were tacos, folk dances and tequila. Sorensen adds,
``Cinco de Mayo is becoming huge out here, even though there is a
very small Mexican population.''

LOONY TIME, OR IS COWBOYS' DEFENSE REALLY GOOD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Insanity already seemed to prevail over
in-house evaluation of the Dallas Cowboys' defensive future. So, if
a certified loony like Alonzo Spellman is added to the mix, as the
current speculation goes, there's obviously no problem with Alonzo
being a fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else seems to think we'll suck, while we think we'll
be pretty good,'' was Wednesday's perfect evaluation from defensive
coordinator Dave Campo.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   Like where's the hand-wringing and excuse-making and
brow-sweating over on-going unanswered questions about the
``Leon-Deion'' issue?
</P>
<P>
   Defensive survival would seem to depend on when those two step
on the field again.
</P>
<P>
   But Chan Gailey opened training camp here the other day by
saying, ``Why is everyone so concerned about the defense? I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones, the always bubbly owner, confidently added to the
show of unity by predicting, ``Our defense will rank top 10 in the
league, maybe top eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even by normal Jerry standards, this claim is grandiose.
</P>
<P>
   And this is also the same Jones who said Wednesday he is seeking
additional bodies, via slim free-agency pickings or a trade, to
upgrade the defense. Spellman, the once-mentally troubled former
Bears' defensive end, was mentioned on an ESPN report Tuesday night
as talking to the Cowboys about employment.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, Jones had no interest over the summer in bringing
back Charles Haley, who is considered locker room trouble by many
at Valley Ranch. When Haley signed a large contract with the 49ers
this week, Jerry shrugged it off by indicating Charles couldn't
have passed a Cowboys' physical because of his back ailments.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Cowboys' defense is viewed league-wide as mainly a
bunch of nobodies or has-beens, and that's even if ``Leon-Deion''
are in the mix. Frankly, Leon Lett performed like a has-been
candidate last season.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, however, Campo has seen it all and heard it all before.
The defensive coordinator for four seasons, he also goes back to
1989 as an original member of Jimmy Johnson's first staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a training camp in the last eight years,
even when we were winning (Super Bowls), where the doubts didn't
center on the defense,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Modesty prevented Campo from adding that in most every season
the defense has also performed way above summertime expectations.
Starting with Dave Wannstedt, and then with Butch Davis, and now
with Campo, the history of the defense is built around being a
pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer is a bit different,'' Campo said, ``because we
have a bunch of names the media doesn't recognize. When that
happens, expectations will be low. From my standpoint, the
personnel we will line up with, I happen to like.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lett awaits suspension time by the league, Campo noted, ``At
this point, he's just a name who's not here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Deion? ``If we don't have him, then we don't have him. My
only concern has to be with people who are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on current information, the Cowboys will flunk every major
defensive requisite for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   They can't stop the run, can't rush the passer and their
shut-down-half-the-field cornerback has only nine good toes.
</P>
<P>
   But while reading a national football publication this week,
Campo admitted to being jolted by an opinion that the Cowboys'
defensive line will rank No. 30 in a 31-team league.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought that was true, we could all go home right now,''
he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   No one says so publicly, to avoid early pressure, but Campo and
defensive line coach Jim Bates are eager to see second-year man
Michael Myers filling in at Lett's tackle spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early yet,'' said Campo, being cautious, ``but Myers
reminds me so much of Russell Maryland. He's fast, quick, a
tireless worker, and has a football mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the defensive line, plus at linebacker, and even in
a Deion-less secondary, Campo claims he sees players and
playmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The description of our defense is fast, young and hungry,'' he
added. ``It will be the fastest defensive unit we've had. I like
that. We got away from the speed scheme over the years. I'm glad to
get back to it. To me, speed is the most critical weapon in today's
NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey raised eyebrows the other day when he described defensive
end Kavika Pittman as ``a potential star.'' Well, he's fast, but
until a slight spurt last season, Pittman also was seemingly
hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   Contradictions are everywhere. It's crazy. Welcome, Alonzo. nn

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The Kosovo Liberation Army has taken
sweeping political control in Kosovo, establishing a network of
self-appointed ministries and local councils, seizing businesses
and apartments, and collecting taxes and customs payments in the
absence of a strong international police presence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a peace agreement that calls for an administration
appointed by the United Nations and the fact that the ethnic
Albanian militants have no legal standing, they have created a fait
accompli. These days they talk not of ceding power to the United
Nations but of cooperating as if they were equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work with the United Nations,'' said Muje Gjonbalaj,
who acts as the deputy minister for reconstruction and development,
``but this is our country and our government. We are in charge
until the elections, when a permanent government will be
installed.''
</P>
<P>
   The KLA's swift move to take power has been aided by the
squabbling and ineffectiveness of the moderate opposition, along
with a disorganized U.N. administration that is short on personnel
and awaiting the police member countries promised to send to help
maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator in Kosovo, said
he was aware of the abuses being committed by the KLA, and insisted
that the organization was working to curb them.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is planning to deploy a 3,100-strong police
force, although it has only 156 officers in Kosovo at the moment.
Kouchner, who has been criticized by U.S. officials for moving too
slowly, said he is working to set up legal mechanisms that will
sort through issues such as property ownership and taxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always like this after wars of liberation,'' he said.
``Things take time. What we want to avoid is an internal war. Some
of these activities are carried out by the KLA, others are carried
out in the name of the KLA. But we must work with them to establish
law and order. It will take more than 10 days. It was exactly the
same in my country when the British, the Americans and the
Canadians liberated France.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening in Kosovo is not just liberation from Serbian
rule, but a revolution. The ramifications for Kosovo and the
international powers that have set up a NATO protectorate, are
immense. The raw, often unschooled fighters have as their political
patrons the government of Albania and seem to care little for the
civilities of western-style democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has been rising steadily, especially against the
remaining pockets of Serbian civilians. The looting and burning of
Serb homes, as well as dozens of assassinations and kidnappings of
Serbs and a few Albanians, including the massacre of 14 Serbian
farmers on Friday, speak of a province spinning into the kind of
gunslinging and anarchy that has characterized Albania in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only political group that has any structure is the KLA,''
said Baton Haxhiu, the editor of Koha Ditore, an Albanian-language
daily. ``It is using it to take power, backed eventually by a
police and a National Guard force it alone will control. It will be
very hard to turn Albania into Kosovo, but I expect very easy to
turn Kosovo into Albania. Each day it is becoming more dangerous to
think and speak independently.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel fighters, who are supposed to turn in their weapons
before the end of September to the NATO-led peacekeepers, have been
slow to comply with the demilitarization agreement and are hiding
large stocks of weapons, NATO officers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Prizren on Friday, German soldiers uncovered a cache of 10
tons of ammunition squirreled away by the KLA. There is an average
of one murder a day, most often of a Serb, and three or four
lootings and house burnings in Prizren, which is in many ways a
typical city in postwar Kosovo. In Prizren, as in most towns in
Kosovo, the city hall and municipal buildings have been
commandeered by the KLA. Former fighters sit in the offices and run
the city.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina several large buildings have been taken over by the
group and turned into ministries. Small cafes, shops, apartments
and the huge shopping center in Pristina are in the hands of KLA
members.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these new entrepreneurs come from rural areas and have
nothing but disdain for the Albanian urban elite, who, they say,
failed to drive away the Serbs under Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, the nonviolent political leader of a faction of Kosovar
Albanians, remains in exile in Italy after a brief visit to Kosovo,
saying he has delayed his return because of concerns about his
security in KLA territory.
</P>
<P>
   Hetem Hetemi, who said he led a unit of 20 KLA fighters in the
war, most from his immediate family, was seated outside his new
business, the Mozart Bar, seized from its Serbian owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sons and I showed up in Pristina with our weapons and
decided to take this bar,'' he said. It was a point of pride to
Hetemi that one of the enemy, a paramilitary leader known as Arkan
who has been indicted on war crimes charges, used to drink at the
bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we had in our village was destroyed,'' Hetemi said.
``I took a Serb car but the KFOR soldiers stopped me and made me
give it to them. What am I supposed to drive? These peacekeepers
are worse than the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The provisional government is headed by Hashim Thaci, a KLA
commander who has appointed himself prime minister and his friends
and relatives to head various departments, including his uncle,
Azem Syla, to the post of defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci's orders are usually delivered by small bands of sunburned
young men, many of them carrying concealed pistols. They are handed
over with warnings that a failure to comply will lead to beatings
or death.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci says he will govern Kosovo until parliamentary elections,
which are expected to be scheduled sometime during the next nine
months. But he does not speak of disbanding the structures that
have been set up to allow the United Nations to assume
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   There is no deadline for elections _ local elections may precede
parliamentary or regional votes _ meaning that Thaci could be in
power for more than a year before any vote is organized by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

COMATOSE WOMAN'S FETUS FOCUS OF BATTLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Texas man is involved in a potentially
precedent-setting legal fight to keep a 15-week fetus alive in the
womb of a comatose woman who may be legally brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Law, 35, of Houston claims he is the biological father of
the fetus and the common-law husband of Tammy Martin, 34, who fell
into a coma July 18, apparently after a blood vessel in her brain
ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   Law believes that officials at Memorial Hospital Northwest in
Houston are conspiring with Martin's parents to allow her and the
fetus to die and prevent his participating in the decision-making
process.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Scott Link on Friday issued a temporary
restraining order preventing the hospital from withdrawing any
life-support treatment until a further hearing Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, when we had our first meeting, they said maybe it's
best to let the baby go, that they had already made funeral
arrangements,'' a distraught Law said at his attorney's office this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby means everything to me, I've never had any children.
I feel the baby has every right to have a chance to live. They
develop technology to be able to make things happen like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's stepfather, J.D. Cox, 58, of Brackettville in South
Texas, acknowledged that he wants his daughter taken off life
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the little baby to go to heaven with her mama,''
said Cox, who married Martin's mother, Joyce Cox, 28 years ago.
``That's not God's work to keep a woman alive when she's already
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said Martin was an alcoholic and a cocaine addict. Doctors
have told him the fetus would likely have severe problems such as
retardation or deformities if it survives to when it could be
removed from the womb at about 25-28 weeks into the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've told me there's already four strikes against the baby
because she was a cocaine addict, an alcoholic, she's brain-dead
and the baby will be premature,'' Cox said. ``If the doctors assure
us the baby will have 10 fingers and 10 toes, we might
reconsider.''
</P>
<P>
   Patty Riddlebarger, spokeswoman for the Memorial-Hermann
Healthcare System, said she could only offer a few comments because
of confidentiality rules. Hospital attorneys were not present
during Friday's temporary-restraining order hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Riddlebarger said the mother and fetus are receiving ``the
highest level of medical care'' and that a test to determine if
Martin is brain-dead has not been done for medical reasons. She
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Law and Cox said the test was planned for last week. Law said
doctors called it off after he raised concerns that it might harm
the fetus, and Cox said the restraining order has shied doctors
away from performing the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise (if the test was done), we could have had all this
terminated. I had the funeral all paid,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Heitman, associate professor of ethics at UT-Houston
Health Science Center, said a fetus so young will generally have a
difficult time developing properly if the mother is in a coma. She
said she is aware of only one similar case _ in Germany two years
ago when doctors kept a woman artificially alive to try to save a
16-week-old fetus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody (mother and fetus) died,'' Heitman said. ``When you
have a mother with profound neurological damage, it affects other
organs, and the other organs affect development.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he does not want to discuss in detail what caused
Martin's injury, because Cox may be trying to file criminal charges
against him. Law claims Martin hit her head against a car door
before going to sleep and seemed fine until she started throwing up
in the morning and losing consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told him he had no way of knowing what had happened to
Martin and that he did everything he could, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox said he plans at the least to file negligent homicide
charges because Law should have brought Martin to the hospital
sooner. He claims Law possibly hit Martin on the head and is trying
to prevent her from being ruled brain-dead because he fears an
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Law said the allegations are absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Death Act establishes procedures that protect
doctors and hospitals from lawsuits when withholding life-support
care to terminally ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, if a patient ruled to be terminally ill did not
previously specify whether he or she should be kept alive
artificially, ``surrogate decision-makers'' are empowered to make
such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Law's attorney, Jared Woodfill, said a spouse has the top
priority as a surrogate decision-maker, and that under Texas law a
common-law husband has the same rights as a legally married spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Riddlebarger said Memorial-Hermann recognizes a common-law
marriage only if the couple has filed such a declaration with a
court or if a court orders that the marriage be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill said that under Texas law, common-law marriages can be
declared if a couple lives together and agrees to present
themselves as wife and husband. He said Law and Martin met the
criteria and he will ask a judge Aug. 5 to rule his client to be
Martin's common-law husband.
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill said Law cannot now assert his legal rights as the
biological father, because the fetus is not born.
</P>
<P>
   Until the temporary restraining order was granted, Law said,
hospital officials kept him in the dark about Martin's treatment
because they considered him simply a ``boyfriend.'' He said he has
not been granted access to her medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Law said he and Martin lived together the last 10 months and
exchanged wedding rings because they intended to marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't really hit me that she might die,'' Law sobbed. ``I
don't know if I can live without her, she was my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cox said he will contest Law's claim to be the common-law
husband.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ben Bruce, with whom Martin had lived for more than
seven years, may be the biological father and will soon file legal
papers demanding DNA testing and that Bruce be declared the
common-law husband.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce acknowledged he plans to file a legal claim ``as a
family'' with the Coxes, but declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to be declared the father so he can let the baby
die,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was facing two years in prison after pleading guilty to
reckless injury to a minor. She was charged with injecting cocaine
into Bruce's minor daughter and then violated her probation.
</P>
<P>
   Another legal issue is a provision in the Texas Natural Death
Act that states, ``(A) person may not withdraw or withhold
life-sustaining procedures under this chapter from a pregnant
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill claims this means that the hospital must keep Martin
alive because she is pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Riddlebarger said hospital attorneys told her the law is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that for the first two days after Martin was admitted
to the hospital, officials told him they had to keep her alive
because she is pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that as long as the fetus had a heartbeat, their
hands were tied,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   But on the third day, he said, hospital officials told him they
consulted with their ``legal team'' and determined that treatment
could be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Law said he never heard about these discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Baruch Brody, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and
Health Policy at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said
attorneys frequently interpret the provision to mean treatment may
not be withheld from pregnant women. But as an ethicist, he prefers
to interpret it to mean that the law does not apply to pregnant
women.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, he said, means that doctors treating terminally
ill pregnant women are not protected from liability by the state
law and must decide whether to continue or stop treatment based on
common-law rights.

 PRISTINA, Yugoslavia: in Europe. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under Thaci, the large ministries here hum with activity. In the
lobby of the old social security building in Pristina, now the
rebel movement's Defense Ministry, groups of wiry young men sat
huddled at their desks over coffee cups and dented tin ashtrays
filled with cigarette butts.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel commanders, many with pistols tucked in shoulder holsters,
moved in conversation up and down the central spiral staircase.
Newly minted bureaucrats with fancy titles _ and late model sedans
and jeeps, all parked outside and curiously lacking license plates
_ barked orders and passed out documents with ``The Defense
Ministry of Kosovo'' stamped across the top.
</P>
<P>
   The reach of these newly formed institutions is increasingly
felt in the streets and neighborhoods, where most people say they
are afraid to run afoul of the self-appointed authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Tahir Canolli, 49, a heavy-set man with a deep baritone voice
and the soothing, obsequious mannerisms of a salesman, ran a
furniture store in Pristina for nearly three decades. He bought his
couches, chairs, dressers and tables from a furniture factory near
Nis, and doggedly fended off Serbian tax inspectors, who visited
frequently with demands for money. He, like many businessmen, hoped
that when he returned to Pristina from the refugee camps in
Macedonia, such harassment would end.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a group of KLA fighters arrived at his shop two weeks
ago with a paper issued from ``The Ministry of Public Order''
demanding the keys to his 1990 Audi 80 and his store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were arrogant, brutal and rude,'' he said, unfolding the
stamped order that he now carries in his pocket. ``They told me
that if I did not comply immediately they knew a cellar I might
like to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worse than Enver Hoxha,'' he added, referring to the
former Stalinist dictator of Albania who died in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, $50,000 worth of furniture was loaded onto trucks
brought by the officials who had demanded his keys. The looters not
only stripped the store of its contents but also ripped out the
heaters, lamps and mirrors. They carted away 24 large flower boxes
that had been outside the building. The next day several flower
boxes of the same design and with the same plants were placed
outside the building where Thaci works.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci's appointees said that such confiscations, especially of
state-owned buildings, were part of their effort to determine
property ownership. They also defended the decision to begin
collecting money from local businesses, a practice many shop owners
have labeled ``extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If mistakes are being made they will be corrected,'' said
Gjonbalaj. ``There were many irregular contracts. We need to
regulate things in Kosovo and this means collecting taxes, or
contributions, rather, to rebuild. We are the legitimate government
and we must assume all governmental responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Canolli has spent hours outside Thaci's ministries in recent
days in the hope that he can reclaim some of his property or be
compensated for it. But each attempt has been rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the KLA police inspector who gave me the confiscation
order driving my car, although it had no license plates,'' he said.
``I went to his office but was told at the door that I should never
come back or attempt to speak with him. I am afraid. I survived
Serb occupation to be destroyed by my own people.''

 &HT;    Downtown parade honoring Armstrong is Aug. 9
 &HT;    By By Gary Estwick

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The city of Austin will host ``Austin's
Celebration of Lance Armstrong,'' a parade for the Tour de France
champion on Aug. 9, said Karl Haussman, director of the Lance
Armstrong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Haussman said Wednesday that a definite time has not been set
for the parade, although 7 p.m. has been mentioned as a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Event organizers expect as many as 15,000 spectators for the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   The parade will start at the Capitol, proceed south on Congress
Avenue and finish at Auditorium Shores off Riverside Drive.
</P>
<P>
   After the parade, which is scheduled to have floats and a local
marching band, Armstrong will be part of a ceremony that will
include Austin Mayor Kirk Watson. Gov. George W. Bush's attendance
has not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Several opening and headline bands will perform at Auditorium
Shores after the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Haussman said the parade will be supported financially through
corporate and individual donations. Excess proceeds will be donated
to the Lance Armstrong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the city's chance to show Lance their appreciation and
support,'' Haussman said.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Rodriguez, marketing director of Capital Sports Ventures,
said Austinites seem ready to celebrate Armstrong's victory.
Armstrong's agent, Bill Stapleton, is president of Capital Sports
Ventures, a sports marketing agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the response that we have seen in our office
through the office phones and the Web site, the people of Austin
couldn't be prouder with Lance Armstrong's accomplishment,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at him as an example of the possibility of
overcoming the odds, looking at death in the face and returning to
an even better lifestyle than he had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1996, has made a
full recovery and dominated the 86th Tour de France that ended
Sunday in Paris.

 &HT;    Bush would broaden government, faith-based organization ties
 &HT;    (EDS: WITH SIDEBARS _ FAITH-PRESIDENT and FAITH-WHAT. This is
the third in an occasional series on presidential campaign issues
and Gov. George W. Bush's record by The Austin
American-Statesman.)By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Anne Cancino bagged groceries at H.E.B. and
tested computer chip wafers on a Motorola assembly line, but she
always dreamed that a college degree would make her ``something
bigger.'' Obstacles, though, loomed large. Cancino had three young
children and no husband. Her mother told her she wasn't smart
enough for college. Eventually, she stopped working to spend more
time with her kids, relying on welfare checks and food stamps to
get by.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Interfaith, a coalition of churches, synagogues and
schools, gave Cancino the tools to dig herself out. The group's
Capital Idea program offered math and reading classes, child care,
housing help. Though government can and does provide all that,
Capital Idea's teachers gave her something more: faith in herself.
Cancino, 21, recently passed the state's college entrance exam and
is about to enroll in Austin Community College to become a
semiconductor technician.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush argues that privately run, taxpayer-funded
programs like Capital Idea can transform lives in ways that
government can't, and he has pushed hard for more ties between
Texas and ``faith-based'' and community groups. There are plenty of
success stories like Cancino's, but state officials don't have
solid empirical evidence on the performance of faith-based programs
_ in fact, they don't even know for sure how many of them get
taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the front-running GOP presidential contender, said last
week that he would expand the relationship between government and
faith-based organizations by allowing such groups to use taxpayer
money to provide any social service now delivered by government.
The other presidential candidates, Democrat and Republican alike,
have also endorsed a greater role for faith-based groups.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he wouldn't ask any group to ``compromise its
core values and spiritual mission'' to get public dollars. But
critics worry that might violate the constitutional ban on
promoting religion.
</P>
<P>
   Even though religious groups have been getting government money
for years, the Supreme Court has heard only a handful of cases
challenging the practice, and the constitutional boundaries remain
fuzzy. If the partnerships multiply, so will the legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``needs to be aware that it's a very complicated task. It's
way more than 'You guys run our welfare program in the state of
Texas,''' said Oliver Thomas, a Baptist preacher and civil rights
lawyer who is a special counsel to the National Council of
Churches. ``If we take that kind of simplistic approach, there will
be widespread abuses, lawsuits and eventually federal judges will
step in and shut down these programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking time out from a college prep class last week, Cancino
wiped tears from her cheeks as she talked about how Capital Idea
has changed her life. ``I really appreciate what they did for me,''
she said. ``They make you feel like, 'Oh, yeah, I can do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its affiliation with Austin Interfaith, religion isn't
part of the program at Capital Idea. But it provided services that
would be tough to find at a state office. One teacher, Eva
Lleverino, helped Cancino find diapers late one night when she
couldn't afford to buy them and gave her money to cover the deposit
on her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``State workers have a mindset of 8-5,'' said Lleverino, who
used to work at the Texas Workforce Commission. ``We don't require
all that red tape to get accepted and get going on something. We
just want them to finish their training and be able to succeed in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Unencumbered by regulation and inspired by their faith,
religious groups can succeed where government fails, many people
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a recognition that human life at its heart is a mystery
and that we are persons not statistics, and faith-based groups seem
to know that,'' said the Rev. Thomas W. Currie III, who chaired
Bush's 1996 task force on faith-based groups. ``They try to deal
with them as a whole person, rather than seeing them as a potential
recipient of a government program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charitable choice,'' a part of the 1996 federal welfare reform
law, has allowed states to forge more faith-based ties. It allows
them to give money to faith-based groups to provide job training
and other services to former welfare recipients, as long as there
are secular alternatives. Bush, who has also signed bills easing
regulations on religious organizations, has made Texas a leader in
implementing ``charitable choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Bush hopes to do for America what he's done for Texas. He
has promised that a Bush White House would ``look first'' to
community and faith-based groups in addressing social problems, and
he pledged ``a commitment to pluralism'' in choosing which groups
to support.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't, however, talk about how he would prevent government
support of faith-based groups from slipping into government support
of certain religions.
</P>
<P>
   A Brenham welfare-to-work program that uses some Department of
Human Services dollars illustrates how ``charitable choice'' can
blur the line between church and state. The program, which is
sponsored by eight local businesses and eight local churches,
includes Bible classes designed to show the value of work.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says such programs prove that ``charitable choice'' lacks
sufficient safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can just hand money to the First Baptist
Church, pat them on the back and say, 'We trust you to provide
secular child care.' There's going to be abuses in that kind of
system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it may not be possible to treat every faith-based
group equally when there is limited government money. In choosing
which groups to support, government also might be put in the
position of deciding which beliefs are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Faith-based groups don't get any special scrutiny in Texas. A
Bush aide serves as a ``clearinghouse'' for faith-based groups and
is compiling a database to track them, but there isn't a central
state office. Texas agencies monitor all of their contractors to
make sure taxpayer money isn't being wasted, and contracts with
faith-based groups prohibit proselytizing. But state officials
don't always know which of its contractors are faith-based, let
alone how they are using religion in their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Workforce Commission, which as the state's primary
welfare-to-work agency has numerous financial contracts with
faith-based groups, can't say exactly how many it deals with, or
how much money it gives to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't track these programs like you would think we would
track them,'' said commission spokesman Larry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the only way to ensure that faith-based groups
that get public money aren't promoting their religion is to require
them to hire workers without regard to faith. Under current law,
faith-based groups that get government money can't discriminate in
serving clients but can hire whomever they want.
</P>
<P>
   But many faith-based groups would rather do without government
help if it means dropping religion from their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long history of believing that with government money
comes government control,'' said Weston Ware of Texas Baptist
Christian Life, the public policy arm of the Texas's largest
Baptist group. ``We're basically of the position that church and
state should be kept separate, and that we as a denomination
shouldn't use the coercive powers of government or powers of
taxation to line our own pockets or fulfill our religious agenda.''

AUBURN GLAD OFF-SEASON IS OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Looking forward to football season is a given
in the Southeastern Conference. But at Auburn, the season could
have started Wednesday and it would not have been too early.
</P>
<P>
   Playing games _ even with a team that is expected to trail the
pack in the SEC West _ will provide welcome distractions. The past
nine months have been anything but plain on The Plains, producing
enough negative stories to fill a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come through some tough times and we're still
together,'' senior defensive tackle Jimmy Brumbaugh said Wednesday
at the Southeastern Conference's football media days. ``It's good
to know that in two weeks we'll be starting practice and in about
six weeks we'll play our first game. Then maybe we can give
everybody something else to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The off-season has been filled with talk of last season's messy
resignation of head coach Terry Bowden, Auburn buying out of a date
with Florida State in the season opener and the ongoing lawsuit
involving former interim coach Bill Oliver and the university.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-8 season in this football-mad state would provide enough
discussion topics to fill the typical off-season for any football
program. Auburn hired a public relations firm to help with the
onslaught of problems and questions. That is atypical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all seemed rapid fire,'' first-year coach Tommy
Tuberville said. ``I've made decisions that I thought needed to be
made to get this team back on its feet. They didn't hire me to sit
around and watch soap operas.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an apt description for Auburn's off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The mess started with Terry Bowden's resignation last October.
Bowden stepped down as coach because he was convinced that Auburn
trustee and power broker Bobby Lowder was maneuvering to get Bowden
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Bill Oliver was appointed interim coach.
Oliver is suing the school because he believes that athletic
director David Housel told him he would be the new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the school hired Tuberville of Mississippi for
approximately $800,000 a year (after agreeing to settle Bowden's
contract for $620,000). Tuberville, who had considered taking the
Arkansas job two years ago, left few friends behind in Mississippi
because of his perceived lack of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn took a publicity hit earlier this year when it announced
that it was paying $500,000 to buy its way out of the season opener
against Florida State. Originally scheduled to pit Terry Bowden
against his father Bobby, the game became unpalatable for Auburn
officials because they were worried it would dredge up Bowden's
resignation. The joke is that the school's rallying cry has been
changed from War Eagle to War Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a decision that I thought would be in the best interest
for the long run,'' Tuberville said. ``I didn't think it would be
that much of a controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   In late April, Tuberville created another firestorm when he
rescinded the scholarships of six players. That leaves Auburn with
60 players on scholarship; the NCAA limit is 85. Tuberville's
comment: ``It's a business. We probably wouldn't have recruited
those players.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Tuberville and his players are looking forward to the
Sept. 4 opener _ even if it's against Division I-AA Appalachian
State, the team that replaced Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got to Mississippi (in 1995), I was just looking
for a way to get my name in the paper,'' said Tuberville, who
guided the Rebels out of NCAA probation to a winning program.
``Here, I've just been worried about keeping my name out of the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it was blown out of proportion. We brought a
lot of the controversy on ourselves. We've tried to get some things
behind us. It's been pretty rough.'' nn

 &HT;    Where other candidates stand on faith
 &HT;    (EDS: Sidebar to GWBUSH-FAITH.)By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's Republican rivals have
expressed support for giving faith-based organizations a greater
role in delivering government services. So has Democratic
front-runner Al Gore _ although the timing of his support has been
the subject of some controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to see George Bush following Al Gore's lead to work
with faith-based organizations,'' Gore campaign chairman Tony
Coelho said after Bush's speech at an Indianapolis church last
week. Coelho was referring to Gore's remarks in May at an Atlanta
Salvation Army adult rehabilitation center. The vice president
endorsed ``carefully-tailored partnerships with our faith
community, so we can use approaches that are working best.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, the author of the
``charitable choice'' provision of the 1996 welfare reform law, say
it is Gore who is jumping belatedly on the faith-based bandwagon.
Bush has been aggressively promoting Texas partnerships with
faith-based groups since 1996. In contrast, the Clinton-Gore
administration expressed constitutional concerns about a proposal
to expand charitable choice to some non-welfare government grants
and, according to Ashcroft, has ``undermined implementation'' of
charitable choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, the vice president's campaign has confused being
in the lead with getting lapped,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers say the administration was simply urging caution
during debate on expanding charitable choice. They say Gore, who
spent a year at Vanderbilt's divinity school, is a big believer in
the power of faith-based groups, although he wouldn't go as far as
Bush in allowing them to deliver government services.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the
Democratic nomination, voted for the charitable choice provision of
the welfare bill.

 &HT;    (EDS: SIDEBAR to GWBUSH-FAITH.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Churches and religious organizations and their charitable arms
long have received government contracts to run federal, state and
local programs, particularly social programs. The term
``faith-based'' has become a buzzword for political efforts to
encourage such groups, expand their involvement and remove legal
and bureaucratic barriers. Why not call these programs ``religion
based?'' Faith-based is meant to encompass groups other than
traditional religious organizations.

CBS EXTENDS DEAL WITH HEAD OF TV OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ CBS extended its deal with Leslie Moonves to
serve as the president of CBS Television Wednesday, locking him
into a long-term situation that will ensure he continues as the
leader of its broadcast TV operations.
</P>
<P>
   Under Moonves, CBS has improved its competitive position in
prime-time programming, reaching more total viewers last season
than any other network for the first time since 1993. The network
had been third in that category when Moonves joined CBS in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The move ended widespread speculation in Hollywood that Moonves
was a leading candidate to replace the recently departed Robert
Daly and Terry Semel as the head of the Warner Brothers studio.
Before joining CBS, Moonves served as the head of Warner's
television division, and he maintained a close relationship with
Gerald Levin, the chairman of Warner's parent company, Time Warner
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said Wednesday that he had considered the opportunity at
Warner Brothers ``for about a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It would have been going home. But I feel like I'm
starting to build something at CBS. I think I have the right people
in place now.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS did not disclose the terms of the new deal. Moonves said the
length of the deal was ``in the range'' of five years.
</P>
<P>
   He called it ``a nice situation'' financially and praised the
CBS chairman, Mel Karmazin, for aggressively pursuing completion of
the new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel didn't mess around,'' Moonves said. ``That's one of the
other reasons I made the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Little will change in terms of Moonves' duties, though he will
become a member of the CBS board of directors, having been elected
to the board Wednesday. But otherwise he will continue to manage
all of CBS's television assets other than its cable television
division. CBS Entertainment, News, Sports and its television
stations all report to Moonves.
</P>
<P>
   During the last year, CBS passed NBC as the most watched network
in terms of overall viewers, though the network is still
handicapped financially because its viewers are much older than
those of any other network. Most television advertisers prefer
young adult viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But Moonves has embraced CBS's strategy of counter-programming
the youth-oriented shows on the other networks with shows of older
appeal. He said the CBS television network will make a profit this
year for the first time in three years.

   PAUL ALLEN'S CABLE COMPANY PLANS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft who has built a cable
media empire called Charter Communications, plans to sell shares in
the company.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charter expects to raise about $3.4 billion in an initial public
offering that it will use to finance part of three pending cable
acquisitions. These deals are for Falcon Communications, Fanch
Communications and Avalon Cable Television. The combined value of
the three purchases is about $6.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO PROGRAMMING AT MICROSOFT
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft executive, is returning to his
roots as a programmer as the company seeks to persuade software
developers to continue to rely on its technology despite the rise
of the Internet. In an e-mail to colleagues on Monday, Maritz said
that he was handing off most of his day-to-day management duties to
work more closely with Bill Gates, the chairman, to help ``set
technical direction in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP REJECTS DEMOCRATIC TAX PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the Senate turned aside a democratic plan to
limit the size of their proposed tax cut, even as centrists from
both parties laid out a middle ground on which a compromise could
eventually be forged.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say Republican tax-cut proposals give the rich
gargantuan tax reductions compared with those for everyone else.
Republican leaders respond that their large tax cuts are fair
because high-income families pay a major share of federal taxes.

   COMPUTER STOCKS BUOY NASDAQ
</P>
<P>
   Computer-related stocks lifted the NASDAQ market to its second
consecutive gain. The market was otherwise lackluster as investors
braced for Thursday's reports on employment costs and the gross
domestic product. The NASDAQ composite index was up 26.51 points,
to 2,705.84, but the Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.97 points,
closing at 10,972.07. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed
up 2.56 points, to 1,365.40.

   PHARMACIA PROFIT MATCHES FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the maker of the top-selling glaucoma
treatment Xalatan, said that its second-quarter profit rose 15
percent on stronger sales of that drug and Detrol, its incontinence
pill. The company also sold more of its older products, such as
Nicorette smoking-cessation products. Though the results matched
analysts' expectations, shares of Pharmacia fell $1.9375, to
$55.9375.

   CBS TV PRESIDENT GETS NEW DEAL
</P>
<P>
   CBS has locked Leslie Moonves into a long-term deal to continue

CABLE GIANT IS PLANNING AN OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Calif., Wis., Mich., S.C.)  (lh) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, who has used much of
his wealth to build a cable media empire, is set to take the
company public.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to take advantage of Wall Street's enthusiasm for cable,
the company, Charter Communications Inc., filed a prospectus
Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise
about $3.4 billion in a public offering. It said it would use the
funds to finance part of the purchase of a handful of pending cable
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prospectus, Allen plans to keep voting control
of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Allen looking to the public for financing; he will
personally invest $750 million in a Charter subsidiary, Charter
Holdings Inc., paying the same price for his shares in the unit
that investors pay for their shares in the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has aggressively built the nation's fourth-largest cable
company. After the pending purchases, it will have 6.2 million
subscribers, primarily in St. Louis, Los Angeles and
Greenville-Spartenburg, S.C. Charter also has systems that are
heavily concentrated in Wisconsin and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Had all the purchases been completed at the end of 1998, the
offering memorandum shows, the new company would have had 1998
revenues of $2.67 billion and a net loss of $342.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The cable industry generally measures financial health by cash
flow, and Charter's 1999 pro forma cash flow would have been $1.2
billion, giving it a cash flow margin of 45.1 percent, roughly the
industry norm.
</P>
<P>
   After the public offering, however, the company would have
long-term debt of $10.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One Wall Street analyst, whose firm is not involved in the
transaction, noted that even if 1999 cash flow grew a healthy 10
percent, to $1.3 billion this year, debt would be almost eight
times cash flow. ``That appears to be at the high end of the range
of what exists in the industry,'' the analyst said. ``Over the last
several years, the ratio has been between three and seven, so it
would be more highly leveraged, which introduces a higher level of
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   That could have ramifications for the company's debt ratings,
the analyst added.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the internal growth rate for new subscribers
was 4.8 percent last year, more than twice the national industry
average of 1.7 percent, the prospectus stated. The analyst said
that such healthy growth rates to some degree offset the high debt
because the company is showing the ability to keep increasing cash
flow.
</P>
<P>
   Charter said it would use the proceeds of the offering to pay
for three pending cable acquisitions: Falcon Communications LP of
Los Angeles, the cable systems of Fanch Communications Inc. and
Avalon Cable Television.
</P>
<P>
   The combined value of the three purchases is about $6.8 billion.
Charter had agreed to pay roughly $3.6 billion for Falcon and $885
million for Avalon and $2.4 billion for Fanch.
</P>
<P>
   The prospectus stated that funds not spent on pending
acquisitions would be used either to reduce debt or to make
additional purchases. It also said the company was assuming that it
would be able to raise an additional $1.1 billion toward the
purchase price of yet another pending acquisition, the Bresnan
Communications Co.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and his team are betting that digital cable television,
interactive video programming, high-speed Internet access and local
phone service will increase cash flow from Charter's subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters for the pending initial public offering are Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, Bear Stearns and Goldman, Sachs.

MILLER BREWING MOVES THE ACCOUNTS OF ITS TWO BIGGEST BRANDS.
AGAIN. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wis., Minn., Ore., Ill.)   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A beer blast for two unconventional agencies known
for their creative prowess turned into a beer bust Wednesday when
the Miller Brewing Co. abruptly turned over their assignments, for
its two largest beer brands, to big, mainstream shops that work for
Miller's parent, the Philip Morris Companies.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in less than three years that Miller has
dismissed agencies hired to create campaigns for the two brands,
Miller Lite and Miller Genuine Draft. Both brews have continued to
lose sales and market share despite repeated revampings of
advertising approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The action pretty much speaks for itself,'' said Susan
Henderson, a spokeswoman for Miller in Milwaukee. ``The brands have
not performed up to the category. We need to take a fresh look.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden shifts underscore the ferment roiling the nation's
beer industry, particularly as Miller struggles to bridge a
widening revenue and profit gap being opened by its principal
rival, the Anheuser-Busch unit of the Anheuser-Busch Companies.
They are also emblematic of the quickening pace of agency
reshufflings in competitive consumer product fields like beverages,
computers and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals, effective immediately, deprive Fallon McElligott
in Minneapolis of creative duties on Miller Lite, an account with
billings estimated at $95 million, and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in
Portland, Ore., of creative duties on Miller Genuine Draft, an
account with billings estimated at $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both brands are leaving for units of WPP Group PLC: Miller Lite
to Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in New York and Miller Genuine Draft
to J. Walter Thompson Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, this week's issue of Time magazine carries an
eulogy of David Ogilvy, the founder of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather who died
last week, written by Pat Fallon, chairman of Fallon McElligott.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal removes Fallon McElligott from the Miller agency
roster after it landed the Lite assignment from the Leo Burnett Co.
in Chicago in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody must have decided they needed a change,'' Fallon
said. ``It's disappointing, but these things happen in our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some great work along the way and we made some mistakes
along the way,'' he added. ``I'm sad about it, but we're
resilient.'' There would be no layoffs as a result of the loss,
Fallon said.
</P>
<P>
   Wieden &AMP; Kennedy was also hired by Miller in December 1996,
gaining Genuine Draft from Bates USA in New York, part of the Bates
Worldwide unit of what is now Cordiant Communications Group PLC.
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, however, keeps the creative chores for another
brand, Miller High Life, with billings estimated at $15 million to
$20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sad to lose MGD and proud of the work we did,'' said
David Luhr, chief operating officer at Wieden &AMP; Kennedy. ``And
we're happy about High Life; the sales results have been
fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals came only three-and-a-half months after Philip
Morris ousted the head of Miller and two top lieutenants in an
effort to reverse the unit's flagging fortunes, which were
attributed in large measure to the poor response by most beer
drinkers to the campaigns for Miller Lite and Miller Genuine Draft.
</P>
<P>
   The reassignments are intended to provide ``compelling and
meaningful consumer communications,'' said Robert Mikulay, senior
vice president for marketing at Miller, that would ``help convince
consumers to choose one brand over another.''
</P>
<P>
   The new agencies ``bring a solid understanding of and deep
appreciation for the power of brands,'' he added, ``as well as a
proven track record of grasping a brand's essence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikulay was one of the executives brought to Miller by Philip
Morris after their predecessors were ousted. The Miller chief
executive, John MacDonough, was replaced by John D. Bowlin, a
former top executive at the Kraft Foods division of Philip Morris.
Tellingly, Ogilvy and Thompson handle numerous assignments for
important Kraft brands like Maxwell House coffee, Post cereals,
Kool-Aid, Kraft cheeses, Oscar Mayer cold cuts and Miracle Whip
salad dressing.
</P>
<P>
   To appeal to consumers in their 20s, the ads for Miller Lite and
Miller Genuine Draft eschewed typical elements of beer pitches in
favor of offbeat images and sardonic humor. Critics complained
vociferously that the campaigns put off older beer drinkers and
simply entertained younger ones without providing reasons for
buying Miller beers.
</P>
<P>
   The critics were particularly dismissive of the initial work by
Fallon McElligott for Miller Lite, which featured strange
characters like a make-believe adman named Dick, a 1970s-style
stuntman named Jimmy, a magician's assistant who sprouted mice
under her arms and cowboys who sang about beer on the way to the
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Miller Lite campaign was toned down last year and in March,
after Fallon McElligott survived an agency review, was replaced
altogether with more conventional imagery centered on celebrities
discussing the brand's taste and quality attributes.
</P>
<P>
   The Miller Genuine Draft ads, which at first showed grungy
20-somethings in unglamorous locales like trailer parks, were
replaced in May with similarly more broad-based imagery. But both
revampings apparently came too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first job is to define the brand essence'' of Miller Lite,
said Shelly Lazarus, chairwoman and chief executive at Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather, ``and frankly, from looking at the advertising, I can't
tell what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we do our best work, with brands that have lost
their way a bit,'' said Ms. Lazarus, whose agency has helped
rejuvenate brands like American Express, IBM and Jaguar. ``To me,
it's what does the brand mean to people?''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, for Maxwell House, ``it's not about the beans,''
she added. ``It's about `Good to the last drop' and significant
moments over the course of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller Lite will be Ogilvy &AMP; Mather's first beer brand since
Schaefer, an assignment that ended in 1981. Thompson Chicago, part
of the J. Walter Thompson Co., worked for Miller from 1984 to 1994
on brands like Lowenbrau and Sharp's.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Lite was once America's best-selling light beer and the
No. 2 brand over all behind only Budweiser from Anheuser-Busch. But
the brand lost its lead to the light version of Budweiser, Bud
Light, and is now the third-best-selling brand behind those two
brews. Shipments of Miller Light fell 1.5 percent in the second
quarter compared with those in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Genuine Draft, the best-selling premium-priced regular
Miller brand, ranks seventh among all beers. Shipments for that
brand also declined in the second quarter by an unspecified amount.
</P>
<P>
   Media duties for all Miller brands remain at Starcom U.S.A. in
Chicago, part of the Starcom Worldwide unit of Burnett.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Entre las calles gutierrez y de la guerra, una
docena de puestos venden desde sarapes, trompos, el tipico juego de
baleros y serpentinas hasta mazapanes La Rosa, paletas de tamarindo
y chicles Canels. Al fondo, se escucha la musica de los Regios del
Norte.
 &HT;    Un enorme letrero dice: Order Your Fiesta Dress Now!, y en la
calle, de cada dos banderas que ondean en State Street, una es
mexicana y la otra estadounidense. No, no estamos en la frontera,
sino en la turistica ciudad californiana de Santa Barbara, unos 100
kilometros al norte de Los Angeles, donde el pueblo se prepara para
la gran fiesta del Cinco de Mayo.
 &HT;    Cinco de Mayo? ``Si, es el dia de la Independencia de Mexico. Es
como el 4 de Julio para nosotros los norteamericanos,'' dice un
amistoso adolescente estadounidense que trabaja en la libreria
Borders Bookstore.
 &HT;    Pero resulta que el Cinco de Mayo es simplemente el aniversario
de la Batalla de Puebla, librada en 1862 entre tropas francesas
enviadas por Napoleon III y un ejercito campesino mexicano.
Detalles historicos aparte, lo que importa es que la fecha ha
comenzado a convertirse en un simbolo de la cultura mexicana al
norte del rio Bravo, y no solamente en California _ donde el
Servicio de Correos emitio una estampilla conmemorativa _ sino cada
vez mas en otros estados.
 &HT;    ``Creo que el Cinco de Mayo se vuelve cada vez mas popular en
Estados Unidos, es como una especie del Dia de San Patricio [una
popular celebracion irlandesa que ha prendido en Estados Unidos del
nuevo milenio,'' afirma Pete Hamill, un escritor nacido en Brooklyn
que pasa la mitad de su tiempo en Mexico y la otra en Nueva York.
 &HT;    Hoy la cultura mexicana penetra el estilo de vida tipico de
Estados Unidos, donde todo lo que huele a Mexico _ llamese comida,
cerveza, musica o fiestas nacionales _ se vende como pan caliente.
``Mexico esta recuperando el terreno perdido, gastronomicamente,''
dijo Carlos Monsivais, un reconocido autor mexicano.
 &HT;    Para darse cuenta de como el consumidor estadounidense asimila
rapidamente la cultura mexicana, basta echar un vistazo al cambio
en sus habitos alimenticios, a lo que lleva en el carrito del
supermercado y a los restaurantes de moda en sus grandes ciudades.
La comida mexicana los trae locos.
 &HT;    ``Los norteamericanos comienzan a experimentar otras culturas a
traves de sus comidas,'' explica Hamill. ``Asi fue con los
italianos; entonces descubrieron la comida judia y alemana, y ahora
la mexicana y eso es porque cada vez hay mas mexicanos.''
 &HT;    Y si que hay mas. Segun la Oficina del Censo de Estados Unidos,
el 59 por ciento de los 30 millones de hispanos que viven en
Estados Unidos es de origen mexicano, y se calcula que para el 2010
habra 41,5 millones de hispanos en el pais, 25,6 millones de ellos
mexicanos (ver recuadro en la pagina 54). ``La poblacion mexicana
esta creciendo no solo en California, Texas y Nueva York, sino en
lugares como Minnesota, Michigan, donde nadie antes se imagino que
pudiera existir una poblacion mexicana significativa,'' dice Andrew
Erlich, de la firma de investigacion de mercado Erlich
Transcultural Consultant .
 &HT;    Y concluye: ``Estamos hablando de algo mas profundo; desde
estilos de vida y comida hasta bailes, musica... hay mucho mas que
meros dolares.''
 &HT;    Pero los que se vuelcan cada vez mas hacia la comida mexicana no
son precisamente los hispanos. El consumidor tipico estadounidense
hace rato que se dio cuenta que la comida mexicana va mas alla del
Tex-Mex.
 &HT;    El estomago norteamericano se esta amoldando a los gustos y
sabores exoticos que traen consigo los inmigrantes que llegan para
quedarse. No es por casualidad, dicen muchos sin exagerar, que al
menos en materia de la comida rapida, los tacos han comenzado a
sustituir a las hamburguesas como una alternativa mas atractiva
para las nuevas generaciones, sin contar que las salsas picantes
tambien van dejando atras al tradicional ketchup.
 &HT;    ``El americano conoce cada vez mas la comida mexicana; ahora no
solo conocen el mole poblano, sino que pueden distinguir entre un
buen mole poblano y otro no tan bueno,'' dice orgulloso Gregorio
Camarillo, trabajador de The Gardens of Taxco, un restaurante
mexicano en el corazon de Hollywood, entre cuyos habitues estan
Jannette Jackson, Charles Bronson, Dolly Parton y Quentin
Tarantino.
 &HT;    Dave DeWitt, director de Fiery-Foods Magazine, una revista de
Albuquerque, Nuevo Mexico, especializada en comidas picantes, dice
que los norteamericanos han aprendido que comer aji picante, y que
incluso le van tomando el gusto. La razon, dice DeWitt, es
sencilla: tiene que ver con el cambio en los patrones de
inmigracion. ``Mientras que hace 100 anos eramos europeos, ahora
nos estamos volviendo mas latinos, aunque el picante no es
exclusivo de la comida mexicana, tambien esta presente en los
platos de la India y Tailandia. Pero los mexicanos fueron los que
lideraron esto,'' dice DeWitt, y agrega: ``La comida picante ya es
parte de la vida normal en Estados Unidos; y no solo en estados
como California, Texas o Nuevo Mexico esta en todas partes.''
 &HT;    Pero la tendencia hacia los alimentos con poca o ninguna grasa
ha hecho necesario modificar algunas de estas nuevas recetas.
Pozole sin grasa, salsa picante ligera, chorizo de soya y tortillas
mexicanas sin grasa son algunas de las variaciones que adoptan en
Estados Unidos, lo que crea una cultura gastronomica que parece no
ser ``ni de aqui ni de alla``.
 &HT;    Pero el cambio no se limita a la comida. Aunque ya no es noticia
que la mexicana Corona es la numero uno entre las cervezas
importadas en Estados Unidos, los bebedores estadounidenses ahora
se jactan de tener un gusto refinado.
 &HT;    Y es que tienen mucho de donde elegir. Jones, un supermercado de
Los Angeles, ofrece desde las conocidas marcas Corona, Tecate y Dos
Equis, hasta otras no tan conocidas, Chihuahua y Pacifico. Segun
Beverage Marketing Corporation, una firma de investigacion de
mercado de Nueva York, de las 30 principales cervezas importadas
que se venden en Estados Unidos, siete son mexicanas. Corona es la
primera, seguida de Tecate, Dos Equis, Modelo Especial, Corona
Light, Pacifico y Negra Modelo. Y mientras las cervezas canadienses
sufren de una baja pronunciada en ventas por volumen en Estados
Unidos, las mexicanas gozan de un sorprendente crecimiento del 40
por ciento anual, frente al 5,3 por ciento de Heineken, la
destronada reina de las importadas.
 &HT;    En materia de alcohol, el tequila arrasa en cuanto a
crecimiento, variedad, importacion y consumo entre los
estadounidenses. Mientras que el consumo de bebidas alcoholicas en
ese pais ha bajado sostenidamente en los ultimos anos, la excepcion
es el mexicanisimo tequila, cuyo consumo se ha duplicado de 1985 a
la fecha, para alcanzar 15,7 millones de galones en 1998.
 &HT;    ``El tequila es una de las categorias de licores mas robusta en
Estados Unidos,'' dice Lisa Hawkins, portavoz del Consejo de
Bebidas Espirituosas de Estados Unidos. ``En todo el pais los bares
y restaurantes aumentan su seleccion de tequilas.''
 &HT;    Para cualquier mexicano, los anaqueles de licorerias y
supermercados son una verdadera novedad, con marcas tan poco
conocidas como Two Fingers; Montezuma, Don Cesar Monterrey, Jarana
o Puerto Vallarta, que se venden hasta en US$60 la botella. Y es
que el tequila ha dejado de ser la bebida fuerte y vulgar asociada
a las peliculas de pistoleros mexicanos para convertirse en algo
mas chic.
 &HT;    ``El tequila tiene atractivo amplio,'' afirma Chris Klinefelter,
portavoz de Brown-Forman Corporation, empresa estadounidense que a
principios de este ano anuncio un acuerdo con Tequila Orendain, de
Jalisco, para distribuir en todo el mundo las marcas de tequila
premium de esa empresa mexicana. Y aunque para muchos las razones
de este aumento de consumo se debe a un excelente mercadeo, lo
cierto es que las cifras muestran que el auge tiene para rato: las
ventas de tequila en Estados Unidos se incrementaron un 31 por
ciento entre 1994 y 1998, para llegar a US$1,560 millones.
 &HT;    Impulsada por la oferta, la venta de musica hispana en Estados
Unidos crecio un 16 por ciento, a US$571 millones, en 1998, cifra
que si bien es apenas el 4,1 por ciento de este enorme mercado
musical, que mueve US$13.700 millones al ano, refleja el creciente
gusto por lo latino, segun cifras de la Sociedad de la Industria
Fonografica de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Aunque todavia en la mayor parte de Estados Unidos el fenomeno
de la musica latina se asocia con el puertorriqueno Ricky Martin,
la chicana Selena o la cubanoamericana Gloria Estefan, muchas
bandas y solistas de musica mexicana entran poco a poco al tipico
vivir en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Y es que, segun Hamill, despues de la comida, ``la musica es
otra forma en que los norteamericanos absorben y sienten una
cultura.'' Cuenta que en una de sus recientes visitas a Nueva York
se sorprendio al conocer que estaban agotadas las entradas al Radio
City Music Hall para un concierto de Luis Miguel, y, lo mas ironico
de todo, era un espectaculo con canciones de los anos 50. ``Nos
revivieron a Agustin Lara,'' dice.
 &HT;    Para los mas escepticos, como Marcelo Salup, vicepresidente de
la agencia de publicidad Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, en Miami, ``lo
mexicano aqui no existe. Lo unico mexicano es Taco Bell y si le
pides a un mesero una Dos Equis, se te quedan mirando como si
estuvieras hablando otro idioma.'' Puede que sea asi, pero las
cosas estan cambiando incluso en Miami. En esa ciudad, el Canal 23,
perteneciente a Univision, la mayor cadena de TV en espanol en
Estados Unidos y controlada en parte por el grupo mexicano
Televisa, es lider el los indices de sintonia, por encima de los
canales en ingles, y la mayoria de sus programas son mexicanos.
Ademas, el ano pasado, se celebro por segunda vez el 15 de
septiembre, el verdadero Dia de la Independencia de Mexico, en el
centro de la ciudad con tacos, bailes folcloricos y tequila.
 &HT;    Sorensen agrega: ``El Cinco de Mayo se ha vuelto algo muy
importante aqui, aunque la poblacion mexicana aqui es muy
pequena.''

la chicana Selena o la cubanoamericana Gloria Estefan, muchas

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Entre las calles gutierrez y de la guerra, una
docena de puestos venden desde sarapes, trompos, el tipico juego de
baleros y serpentinas hasta mazapanes La Rosa, paletas de tamarindo
y chicles Canels. Al fondo, se escucha la musica de los Regios del
Norte.
 &HT;    Un enorme letrero dice: Order Your Fiesta Dress Now!, y en la
calle, de cada dos banderas que ondean en State Street, una es
mexicana y la otra estadounidense. No, no estamos en la frontera,
sino en la turistica ciudad californiana de Santa Barbara, unos 100
kilometros al norte de Los Angeles, donde el pueblo se prepara para
la gran fiesta del Cinco de Mayo.
 &HT;    Cinco de Mayo? ``Si, es el dia de la Independencia de Mexico. Es
como el 4 de Julio para nosotros los norteamericanos,'' dice un
amistoso adolescente estadounidense que trabaja en la libreria
Borders Bookstore.
 &HT;    Pero resulta que el Cinco de Mayo es simplemente el aniversario
de la Batalla de Puebla, librada en 1862 entre tropas francesas
enviadas por Napoleon III y un ejercito campesino mexicano.
Detalles historicos aparte, lo que importa es que la fecha ha
comenzado a convertirse en un simbolo de la cultura mexicana al
norte del rio Bravo, y no solamente en California _ donde el
Servicio de Correos emitio una estampilla conmemorativa _ sino cada
vez mas en otros estados.
 &HT;    ``Creo que el Cinco de Mayo se vuelve cada vez mas popular en
Estados Unidos, es como una especie del Dia de San Patricio [una
popular celebracion irlandesa que ha prendido en Estados Unidos del
nuevo milenio,'' afirma Pete Hamill, un escritor nacido en Brooklyn
que pasa la mitad de su tiempo en Mexico y la otra en Nueva York.
 &HT;    Hoy la cultura mexicana penetra el estilo de vida tipico de
Estados Unidos, donde todo lo que huele a Mexico _ llamese comida,
cerveza, musica o fiestas nacionales _ se vende como pan caliente.
``Mexico esta recuperando el terreno perdido, gastronomicamente,''
dijo Carlos Monsivais, un reconocido autor mexicano.
 &HT;    Para darse cuenta de como el consumidor estadounidense asimila
rapidamente la cultura mexicana, basta echar un vistazo al cambio
en sus habitos alimenticios, a lo que lleva en el carrito del
supermercado y a los restaurantes de moda en sus grandes ciudades.
La comida mexicana los trae locos.
 &HT;    ``Los norteamericanos comienzan a experimentar otras culturas a
traves de sus comidas,'' explica Hamill. ``Asi fue con los
italianos; entonces descubrieron la comida judia y alemana, y ahora
la mexicana y eso es porque cada vez hay mas mexicanos.''
 &HT;    Y si que hay mas. Segun la Oficina del Censo de Estados Unidos,
el 59 por ciento de los 30 millones de hispanos que viven en
Estados Unidos es de origen mexicano, y se calcula que para el 2010
habra 41,5 millones de hispanos en el pais, 25,6 millones de ellos
mexicanos (ver recuadro en la pagina 54). ``La poblacion mexicana
esta creciendo no solo en California, Texas y Nueva York, sino en
lugares como Minnesota, Michigan, donde nadie antes se imagino que
pudiera existir una poblacion mexicana significativa,'' dice Andrew
Erlich, de la firma de investigacion de mercado Erlich
Transcultural Consultant .
 &HT;    Y concluye: ``Estamos hablando de algo mas profundo; desde
estilos de vida y comida hasta bailes, musica... hay mucho mas que
meros dolares.''
 &HT;    Pero los que se vuelcan cada vez mas hacia la comida mexicana no
son precisamente los hispanos. El consumidor tipico estadounidense
hace rato que se dio cuenta que la comida mexicana va mas alla del
Tex-Mex.
 &HT;    El estomago norteamericano se esta amoldando a los gustos y
sabores exoticos que traen consigo los inmigrantes que llegan para
quedarse. No es por casualidad, dicen muchos sin exagerar, que al
menos en materia de la comida rapida, los tacos han comenzado a
sustituir a las hamburguesas como una alternativa mas atractiva
para las nuevas generaciones, sin contar que las salsas picantes
tambien van dejando atras al tradicional ketchup.
 &HT;    ``El americano conoce cada vez mas la comida mexicana; ahora no
solo conocen el mole poblano, sino que pueden distinguir entre un
buen mole poblano y otro no tan bueno,'' dice orgulloso Gregorio
Camarillo, trabajador de The Gardens of Taxco, un restaurante
mexicano en el corazon de Hollywood, entre cuyos habitues estan
Jannette Jackson, Charles Bronson, Dolly Parton y Quentin
Tarantino.
 &HT;    Dave DeWitt, director de Fiery-Foods Magazine, una revista de
Albuquerque, Nuevo Mexico, especializada en comidas picantes, dice
que los norteamericanos han aprendido que comer aji picante, y que
incluso le van tomando el gusto. La razon, dice DeWitt, es
sencilla: tiene que ver con el cambio en los patrones de
inmigracion. ``Mientras que hace 100 anos eramos europeos, ahora
nos estamos volviendo mas latinos, aunque el picante no es
exclusivo de la comida mexicana, tambien esta presente en los
platos de la India y Tailandia. Pero los mexicanos fueron los que
lideraron esto,'' dice DeWitt, y agrega: ``La comida picante ya es
parte de la vida normal en Estados Unidos; y no solo en estados
como California, Texas o Nuevo Mexico esta en todas partes.''
 &HT;    Pero la tendencia hacia los alimentos con poca o ninguna grasa
ha hecho necesario modificar algunas de estas nuevas recetas.
Pozole sin grasa, salsa picante ligera, chorizo de soya y tortillas
mexicanas sin grasa son algunas de las variaciones que adoptan en
Estados Unidos, lo que crea una cultura gastronomica que parece no
ser ``ni de aqui ni de alla``.
 &HT;    Pero el cambio no se limita a la comida. Aunque ya no es noticia
que la mexicana Corona es la numero uno entre las cervezas
importadas en Estados Unidos, los bebedores estadounidenses ahora
se jactan de tener un gusto refinado.
 &HT;    Y es que tienen mucho de donde elegir. Jones, un supermercado de
Los Angeles, ofrece desde las conocidas marcas Corona, Tecate y Dos
Equis, hasta otras no tan conocidas, Chihuahua y Pacifico. Segun
Beverage Marketing Corporation, una firma de investigacion de
mercado de Nueva York, de las 30 principales cervezas importadas
que se venden en Estados Unidos, siete son mexicanas. Corona es la
primera, seguida de Tecate, Dos Equis, Modelo Especial, Corona
Light, Pacifico y Negra Modelo. Y mientras las cervezas canadienses
sufren de una baja pronunciada en ventas por volumen en Estados
Unidos, las mexicanas gozan de un sorprendente crecimiento del 40
por ciento anual, frente al 5,3 por ciento de Heineken, la
destronada reina de las importadas.
 &HT;    En materia de alcohol, el tequila arrasa en cuanto a
crecimiento, variedad, importacion y consumo entre los
estadounidenses. Mientras que el consumo de bebidas alcoholicas en
ese pais ha bajado sostenidamente en los ultimos anos, la excepcion
es el mexicanisimo tequila, cuyo consumo se ha duplicado de 1985 a
la fecha, para alcanzar 15,7 millones de galones en 1998.
 &HT;    ``El tequila es una de las categorias de licores mas robusta en
Estados Unidos,'' dice Lisa Hawkins, portavoz del Consejo de
Bebidas Espirituosas de Estados Unidos. ``En todo el pais los bares
y restaurantes aumentan su seleccion de tequilas.''
 &HT;    Para cualquier mexicano, los anaqueles de licorerias y
supermercados son una verdadera novedad, con marcas tan poco
conocidas como Two Fingers; Montezuma, Don Cesar Monterrey, Jarana
o Puerto Vallarta, que se venden hasta en US$60 la botella. Y es
que el tequila ha dejado de ser la bebida fuerte y vulgar asociada
a las peliculas de pistoleros mexicanos para convertirse en algo
mas chic.
 &HT;    ``El tequila tiene atractivo amplio,'' afirma Chris Klinefelter,
portavoz de Brown-Forman Corporation, empresa estadounidense que a
principios de este ano anuncio un acuerdo con Tequila Orendain, de
Jalisco, para distribuir en todo el mundo las marcas de tequila
premium de esa empresa mexicana. Y aunque para muchos las razones
de este aumento de consumo se debe a un excelente mercadeo, lo
cierto es que las cifras muestran que el auge tiene para rato: las
ventas de tequila en Estados Unidos se incrementaron un 31 por
ciento entre 1994 y 1998, para llegar a US$1,560 millones.
 &HT;    Impulsada por la oferta, la venta de musica hispana en Estados
Unidos crecio un 16 por ciento, a US$571 millones, en 1998, cifra
que si bien es apenas el 4,1 por ciento de este enorme mercado
musical, que mueve US$13.700 millones al ano, refleja el creciente
gusto por lo latino, segun cifras de la Sociedad de la Industria
Fonografica de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Aunque todavia en la mayor parte de Estados Unidos el fenomeno
de la musica latina se asocia con el puertorriqueno Ricky Martin,
la chicana Selena o la cubanoamericana Gloria Estefan, muchas
bandas y solistas de musica mexicana entran poco a poco al tipico
vivir en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Y es que, segun Hamill, despues de la comida, ``la musica es
otra forma en que los norteamericanos absorben y sienten una
cultura.'' Cuenta que en una de sus recientes visitas a Nueva York
se sorprendio al conocer que estaban agotadas las entradas al Radio
City Music Hall para un concierto de Luis Miguel, y, lo mas ironico
de todo, era un espectaculo con canciones de los anos 50. ``Nos
revivieron a Agustin Lara,'' dice.
 &HT;    Para los mas escepticos, como Marcelo Salup, vicepresidente de
la agencia de publicidad Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, en Miami, ``lo
mexicano aqui no existe. Lo unico mexicano es Taco Bell y si le
pides a un mesero una Dos Equis, se te quedan mirando como si
estuvieras hablando otro idioma.'' Puede que sea asi, pero las
cosas estan cambiando incluso en Miami. En esa ciudad, el Canal 23,
perteneciente a Univision, la mayor cadena de TV en espanol en
Estados Unidos y controlada en parte por el grupo mexicano
Televisa, es lider el los indices de sintonia, por encima de los
canales en ingles, y la mayoria de sus programas son mexicanos.
Ademas, el ano pasado, se celebro por segunda vez el 15 de
septiembre, el verdadero Dia de la Independencia de Mexico, en el
centro de la ciudad con tacos, bailes folcloricos y tequila.
 &HT;    Sorensen agrega: ``El Cinco de Mayo se ha vuelto algo muy
importante aqui, aunque la poblacion mexicana aqui es muy
pequena.''

 &HT;    Sanders' retirement looks like real deal...for now
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When fat salaries began to permeate sports in the
1980's, one of the worries was that our best athletes would amass
their fortunes, exit early and leave us wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the best players held on longer and longer because
their earning power was so great at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we had the specter of Steve Carlton, unable to admit he had
lost his slider, being ripped like a batting practice bobo; and of
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sky-hooking through the cobwebs; and even now,
of Warren Moon, unable to let go, waiting for his next injury.
</P>
<P>
   If his retirement is serious, Barry Sanders is the first to
actually leave with 6 or 7 years of highlight reel performances
left.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Michael Jordan still had a couple of magical years in his
tank when he quit after last season, and John Elway maybe had
another decent season available.
</P>
<P>
   But in the main, our best have overstayed rather than sneaked
out early. And none has left this early since Jim Brown quit the
Cleveland Browns in an era when money was a reverse factor _ that
is, Brown could make more in Hollywood than he could running with a
football.
</P>
<P>
   At first I thought Sanders' retirement was like one of those
boxing retirements of Muhammad Ali or Sugar Ray Leonard. I thought
he was angling to be traded or to rework his contract. But Thursday
I talked with a friend who knows Sanders pretty well, and he said
it's real.
</P>
<P>
   He told me that late in the final game of his 1989 rookie
season, Sanders needed 10 yards to claim the NFL rushing
championship, but the game was meaningless for both teams and
Sanders was out of it. Coach Wayne Fontes approached him and asked
if he wanted to carry the ball a couple more times and pass
Christian Okoye of Kansas City for the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the 1,458 yards he needs to pass Walter Payton means
so little to him. He is one of those rarest of athletes,
unconcerned with personal accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   And money? He's made plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Plus he was tighter than scuba gear with that money. ``He drove
the same old clunker he had in college his first four or five years
in Detroit,'' my friend said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, his relationship with management was poisoned by
losing. The Lions have been mostly mediocre (78-82) in his 10
years, and when they allowed three of last year's offensive linemen
to escape via free agency, Sanders apparently saw more years of
mindless drifting and didn't want to play through it.
</P>
<P>
   That he waited this long to make his decision, giving the team
no time to adjust, is a mark against him.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Ross said he made 10 phone calls and wrote three or
four letters to Sanders in the off-season, and Sanders never
answered any of them. Whatever his reasons, that was not the
honorable thing to do, but it certainly spoke to the much-denied
but apparently real conflict he had with Ross.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the end, Sanders' legacy is unclear. He was brilliant
in spurts, but of all the feature backs in the league in his 10
years, he was the last guy you wanted to hand the ball to on
3rd-and-1 because he too often would get immersed in trying for 21
and end up not getting the one.
</P>
<P>
   I still expect to see Sanders back in uniform eventually, maybe
after a one-year respite, similar to Jordan's. I always thought
Sanders played with a joy, and if I'm right, he'll miss the game
more than it misses him.

SEEKING RESPECT FOR LOWLY BAT RAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEAL BEACH, Calif. _ Is that a marlin?
</P>
<P>
   Usually that question gets an unintelligible response from a
frantic angler readying for the battle of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Only chuckles, ribbing and profanity followed.
</P>
<P>
   For this opponent _ the much-maligned bat ray _ has long been
thought to be unworthy, the laughingstock of inshore marine
specimens. But because of their habit of peeling off line _ often
in screaming fashion when lightweight tackle is employed _ with
their powerful ``wings,'' they are (begin ital)un(end
ital)affectionately dubbed mud marlin.
</P>
<P>
   But I quite disagree with the lousy assessment of this unusual
and prehistoric species, and _ very likely to the dismay of
grizzled veterans _ I am not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fun,'' said Will Akins, a Grover Beach skipper of a
sportfishing charter-boat out of Morro Bay. ``When the halibut
aren't biting, you go into the back bays to catch bat rays and
leopard sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I never tried eating them (rays). I heard someone
saying it was good, but they also had about 15 beers, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Too ugly to be sampled by most sportfishermen and often unsavory
due to a high urea content in their muscle, (begin ital)Myliobatis
californica(end ital) has a reputation as a trash fish. However, it
is considered fine fare in some Asian cultures and was a staple of
ancient American Indians here. Yet it isn't even thought to be a
game fish, earning no line-class-record consideration by the
International Game Fish Association. (Curiously, it does warrant an
all-tackle category; a 181-pounder taken from the Huntington Beach
Pier set the standard in 1978.)
</P>
<P>
   But few other fish pull on 6- to 10-pound line quite like the
bat ray, as I discovered on a sunny Friday in late spring when more
than 200 fish in a variety of species were caught and released by
four anglers in the Long Beach and Los Angeles harbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to praise the mud marlin,'' said a somewhat facetious
Larry G. Allen, a biology professor at Cal State Northridge who
accompanied me on the private boat of Placentia fishing guide Mike
Gardner. ``They are really tough fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when fish are practically jumping in the boat, as they
say, there are many stories to tell, and the bat ray was just one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   The real star of the day was the bait _ a three-inch stick of
dynamite in a plastic mold called a chartreuse grub. It fooled a
remarkable assortment of targets _ yellowfin croaker, sand bass,
calico bass, shark, ray, sculpin, halibut, barracuda _ proving to
be simply irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   So, inshore anglers take heed: You can use any color lure you
want, as long as it's yellow-green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that if the fish are there, I'm going to get them on
one of those colors,'' said Allen. ``In those green-water
conditions, most days that will out-fish anything else you throw
3-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really knows why chartreuse works so well, Allen
explained. But against the green-tint, plankton-blue color that is
common for nutrient-rich back bays, estuaries and inner harbors, it
seems to be highly visible to these fish. And the grub _ a
curly-tail, or shrimp-tail lure frequently fished on a 3/8-ounce,
football-shaped leadhead with a size 3/0 hook _ appears to mimic a
variety of green baitfishes, including the giant kelpfish. Gardner
believes that when sent to the bottom, the artificial grub resemble
the bivalves of clams _ tasty fare for many fish, especially sand
bass and the infamous bat ray.
</P>
<P>
   While there may be no science to explain its success, experience
certainly does, and I'll take that any day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chartreuse works 24-7, all year long,'' Gardner said.
``It's the most productive lure I got. I have caught fish from
Washington all the way to Baja on this lure. And if I only could
take one lure, that would be the one that I would use.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was fooled on more than one occasion into thinking a bat
ray he hooked was a revered white seabass. ``This is a fish. This
is a fish,'' he proclaimed. But it was (begin ital)just(end ital) a
ray. Poor bat ray; it's not even considered a fish.
</P>
<P>
   But Gardner would later recant. ``They're fun,'' he said. ``But
they hurt my shoulder. I have arthritis in my shoulder. So I hand
them off.''
</P>
<P>
   And I was more than happy to oblige, taking a couple of 40- to
50-pound gift bat rays and cranking the reel handle for all I was
worth.
</P>
<P>
   It's awfully tough to bring these unsung heroes to the boat,
because once they see the vessel those wings act like propellers
with line in tow. Many are inadvertently snagged in the wing,
making for a stronger tussle. Therefore, Gardner maintains, you may
be relegated to only ``counting coup'' by touching the ray with
your rod tip.
</P>
<P>
   The biology of the bat ray is of interest. They have crushing
plates in their mouths that are used like vices to break open clams
and oysters, Allen explained. They have such a passion for
shellfish that oyster farms up the coast are enclosed by fences.
The habit of using their wings in hunchbacked fashion in search of
buried meals by disturbing sand and sediment is considered an
important element in helping to maintain the diversity of the
organisms that live in ocean bottoms. Like most sharks and rays,
they are very long-lived and slow-growing and have low reproductive
output. They can be found swimming alone or in large groups
numbering to the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, here we go, another mud marlin,'' Allen joked on the next
hookup. ``We have found bat-ray central.''
</P>
<P>
   Just my type of place, thank you. &QL;

 &HT;    Senate will likely approve military base construction
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A banner budget year awaits Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base with final votes on a military construction bill that
includes $43.6 million in improvements for the base.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the House of Representatives is expected to take up the
bill that emerged this week from a House-Senate conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is likely to provide its approval next week, which
could make the $8.4 billion spending plan the first appropriations
bill for fiscal year 2000 to reach President Clinton's desk.
</P>
<P>
   After a rocky budget process that featured deep cuts in critical
research spending and a credible attack on the F-22 fighter,
Wright-Pat has emerged as a clear winner in the budget season,
amassing more big projects in a single budget than it has in recent
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be the biggest budget for us ever,'' said Dan Curtis,
vice president of the Miami Valley Economic Development Coalition.
``If it's not the biggest, it's one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the construction projects, the base also is in
the running to receive millions more in program dollars as part of
an overall defense bill that still must be finalized between the
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the projects in the military construction bill is
$13.6 million for a long-sought avionics laboratory that would
consolidate the work of several existing buildings into a single
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the work of separate labs has been a priority because,
in addition to improving efficiency with better facilities, it
heightens security to permit the study of more important, more
highly classified projects. The lab will work on the systems that
integrate jet fighter avionics with battlefield information
gathered by such things as space-based lasers.
</P>
<P>
   The construction bill also has $17.5 million for an aerospace
structures lab at the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those, I think, should position the base well as the Air Force
moves further into the the space age,'' said U.S. Rep. David L.
Hobson, R-Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Positioning the base to perform space research became a priority
this year when the Air Force abruptly eliminated nearly $100
million in aviation research, much of it done at Wright-Pat, to
fund pet Air Force projects in space study. Although Miami Valley
representatives have lobbied to restore funding to some of those
aviation projects, the Air Force has made it clear space programs
will get more and more priority in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``When military construction dollars are declining, it is a big
achievement to get funding for five projects at one base,'' said
U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Dayton, who will control the rules for
debate when the bill reaches the House floor today.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson was in a key position to help secure the local funding,
as chairman of the House subcommittee on military construction and
a member of the House-Senate conference committee that negotiated
the final bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, having someone from the area as chairman of the
military construction subcommittee pays dividends,'' said Curtis,
whose group is a collection of regional leaders who lobby Columbus
and Washington on economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes $6.7 million for an F-16 flight training
complex at Springfield's Air National Guard base. And it has money
for so-called quality-of-life improvements throughout the military,
including at Wright-Pat, something Hobson emphasized during the
drafting of the bill. Wright-Pat will get an occupational health
center and an updated physical fitness center.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said he's excited by the success of the construction bill
because it includes forward-looking projects such as $4 million to
replace the base's aging control tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first step toward preparing for an operational
unit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright-Pat has only a reserve bomber wing located on the base
despite its enormous size and runway capacity. Ohio leaders want
the Air Force to consider it as a logical receiver site for an
operational unit if long-threatened base closings ever become a
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate were split over how to spend the bill's
total budget, and none of the Wright-Pat projects were included in
both versions, which could have led to trouble in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the final bill included all the local projects listed in
each version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is on the verge of approving an extraordinary
investment in Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,'' said U.S. Sen.
Mike DeWine, a Republican from Cedarville.

TVERDOVSKY ACCEPTS DUCKS' OFFER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Oleg Tverdovsky officially returned to the Mighty
Ducks' flock on Wednesday when he agreed to a one-year contract
with Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The defenseman, who spent 3 1/2 years with the Winnipeg/Phoenix
franchise after being traded for Teemu Selanne, accepted Anaheim's
qualifying offer and will earn $1.7 million in the 1999-2000
season, the same amount he made last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the Ducks, agent Don Meehan and Tverdovsky) agreed that
his salary is right for what he brings a team,'' said Ducks
president and general manager Pierre Gauthier of Tverdovsky, who
was a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky, acquired from Phoenix on draft day for a first-round
draft choice and center Travis Green, scored seven goals, 25 points
and was plus-11 for Phoenix last season.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier said he didn't feel pressured to sign the 23-year old
defenseman to a multi-year deal even though Tverdovsky did hold out
once in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope a year from now I have to pay Oleg a lot more money,
because that will mean he's had a great year,'' said Gauthier, who
expects Tverdovsky to provide the Ducks a much needed offensive
presence on the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky's deal was the latest to be worked out as Gauthier
strives to have all his core players under contract by the time
training camp begins on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jason Marshall has an arbitration hearing set for
Aug. 10. Defensemen Ruslan Salei and Pavel Trnka and forward Antti
Aalto are unsigned restricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no hurry,'' he said of those talks. ``It's the quality
of the deal that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gauthier has been busy signing his own players this summer
he has been in no rush to sign free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very weak year for free agents and as we all know New
York (Rangers) did it's thing and we all let them do it,'' said the
GM, who reportedly was interested in checking center Tim Taylor
before the Rangers signed him for $5.8 million over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier said the Ducks would like to improve their depth, but
added that the team is committed to its young players -- not older
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to get in the way of those players,'' he said.

YOUTHFUL STOWAWAY DEFIES SECURITY, JETS TO LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A 17-year-old youth with visions of impressing Israeli
spies, cut the razor wire atop a perimeter fence surrounding Logan
International Airport, walked for two miles across restricted
areas, and stowed away aboard a British Airways Boeing 747,
aviation sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The July 12 incident is being investigated by the Federal
Aviation Administration, the Massachusetts Port Authority _ which
owns and operates Logan and is directly responsible for the
airport's perimeter security _ and the airline, which is
responsible for security in its terminal and around its airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The youth, identified by two aviation sources as Abraham Derman
of Brookline, Mass., climbed over the fence and dropped down onto
the tarmac area north of the main terminals before making his trek
to the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The incident raises questions about security at Logan and is
even more troubling because it involved an international flight.
Such flights have long been considered likely targets for terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Massport and at British Airways said the breach was
extremely serious and exceedingly rare. Both have launched
investigations to make certain the event cannot happen again.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of sources say the following occurred:
</P>
<P>
   Derman walked unchallenged for two miles to Terminal E, where he
climbed the exterior stairs of a jetway and boarded British Airways
Flight 214 to London, which departs daily at 8:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior doors on jetways _ which are the responsibility of
the airline _ have combination locks, so either the lock was not
working or was bypassed, the door was propped open, or someone
opened the door to let Derman into the jetway. From there, he was
like just another passenger bound for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Once on board the jumbo jet, Derman apparently headed for the
coach section. The seat he selected was already assigned to another
person and he was asked to move. He calmly headed to the business
section, found an empty seat and sat down for the flight to London.
In business class, Derman had a more comfortable seat, better food,
plus a choice of 12 movies.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, airlines hand count the passengers on board a flight
and compare that number to the number of tickets pulled as
passengers leave the gate area to board the airplane. It is unclear
why the youth was not discovered during that check.
</P>
<P>
   ``British Airways is cooperating fully with Massport and the
FAA,'' said British Airways spokesman John Lampl. ``We are treating
this situation extremely seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the plane landed at London's Heathrow Airport, Derman
somehow gained access to a restricted area at Heathrow and was
confronted by operations officials.
</P>
<P>
   Heathrow, one of the world's busiest airports, has had problems
with security in the past but has become more aggressive. ``I was
there last year and they really put the lid on things,'' said an
aviation security specialist from Maryland who spoke on condition
neither he nor his company be named.
</P>
<P>
   After Derman was discovered, British Airways returned him to
Boston. Upon his arrival here, Derman told investigators he wanted
to go to Israel and he thought the stunt would impress Mossad, the
Israeli intelligence agency. He also said that he initially tried
to gain access to Logan's tarmac by going through Terminal E, but
was stopped and told to leave. He apparently then walked out and
scaled the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Derman could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges have been filed against Derman, and sources
said it is unlikely they will be brought because he is under 18 and
his parents understand the gravity of the situation. The FAA is
considering levying fines, which can be as high as $11,000 per
violation, against the airline, the airport, and Derman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no comment on the specifics, because the matter is
under investigation,'' said FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac. ``But
this would come under airport and air carrier security, and if they
find violations _ and one case can have a number of violations _
there could be fines.''
</P>
<P>
   Massport spokesman Jeremy Crockford said ``We take this very
seriously, but the most important thing to understand is this is an
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing this is unbelievably foolish. He could have been shot,
or killed by a plane, car, or truck out there. In some ways, this
is equivalent to a computer hacker getting into a military
computer. It is a case where a bright young man misused his
talents.''
</P>
<P>
   The aviation security specialist in Maryland said the incident
``has all kinds of interesting failures in it before the system
finally worked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he exploited a weak spot here. After all, he went
through barbed wire and a locked door,'' the specialist said.
</P>
<P>
   At Heathrow, however, he was not permitted to walk the tarmac
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   Derman was returned to Boston on a British Airways flight on
July 13. He flew back in coach, and British Airways is likely to
ask for compensation, a round-trip business class ticket runs
$5,557, unrestricted coach is $1,389.
</P>
<P>
   When Derman flew back in coach, there were no movie choices. The
only selection playing was ``The Out-of-Towners.''

SIMON AND DYLAN IN CONCERT, NOT QUITE AN ODD COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were no Simon and Garfunkel, no Bob Dylan and
the Band. They weren't even as good a match-up as Bob Dylan and
Elvis Costello singing ``I Shall Be Released'' during the encore of
an impromptu Dylan show the night before at Tramps. But Bob Dylan
and Paul Simon weren't exactly the odd couple either at Madison
Square Garden on Tuesday night when their tour finally came to town
and they shared the stage for four songs.
</P>
<P>
   The two have much in common. Born in 1941, they are among the
best and most expansive songwriters of their time, each with one
hand firmly clasping the political and intellectual zeitgeist. They
were both lifted out of the '60s Greenwich Village folk scene by
Columbia Records, and they are both constantly reinventing their
sound when their audiences least expect it. Simon covered Dylan's
``Times They Are A-Changin''' on the first Simon and Garfunkel
album, and Dylan remade Simon's ``Boxer'' on his ``Self-Portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   For baby boomers, they are measures by which to gauge one's own
growth from time to time: Simon, developing through extroverted
collaboration and leaving his American roots; Dylan, developing
through introverted exploration and digging into his American
roots.
</P>
<P>
   On their own during Tuesday night's three-and-a-half-hour show,
they performed strong sets, particularly Dylan, who has been on a
streak of smiling, dancing, harmonica-wailing, well-enunciated
performances. But when Simon joined Dylan and his band for ``The
Sound of Silence,'' ``Knockin' on Heaven's Door'' and a medley of
``I Walk the Line'' and ``Blue Moon of Kentucky,'' it became clear
that the similarities between the two are only surface deep.
</P>
<P>
   Where the cryptic Dylan is a tangled, dusty back road on which
it is impossible to see more than a few feet ahead, the more
transparent Simon is as obvious and scenic as a parkway. And though
singing harmony is second nature to Simon, trying to harmonize with
Dylan is like trying to catch a fly with chopsticks. As a result,
``The Sound of Silence'' turned from a haunting ballad to a
cacophonous prophecy punctuated with a harmonica solo while
``Heaven's Door'' sounded slightly better when the two took turns
singing. Simon gave the song an older, even more cynical conclusion
by interjecting the lyric ``I hear you knockin' but you can't come
in,'' which Dylan also began singing.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Dylan responded to his 1966 motorcycle accident by
shunning the touring life, since his heart infection in 1997 he has
been a road warrior, performing with one of his tightest backup
groups in years and presenting himself as a bedraggled journeyman
for whom performing is just a paid job. On Monday night at Tramps,
Dylan and his band (with the addition of Charlie Sexton on guitar)
were in rare form, delivering a blistering, highly animated club
show that dipped into obscure pockets of his back catalog. At
Madison Square Garden they catered to the baby boomers and
delivered the '60s hits, deviating most notably for an expressive
version of a newer song, ``Highlands,'' with Dylanesque details
changed in the lyrics. (For reasons having to do with age,
obstinacy or respect for his audience Dylan has not allowed
photographers into shows on the tour, instead issuing a retouched
photograph of a Denver performance with Simon.)
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with his third song, ``A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,''
Dylan began to perk up and become what for him is lively,
illustrating his lyrics with half-finished gestures and shuffling
dance steps (a little from him has always been a lot). Most songs,
like ``Mr. Tambourine Man'' and ``Tangled Up in Blue,'' were
radically rebuilt _ the keys, arrangements and melodies altered _
while Dylan's phrasing stretched and shrank each word to fit, or
not.
</P>
<P>
   He has been so inside his songs for so long that he seemed back
on the outside, leaving leeway for his guitarists Larry Campbell
and Sexton to solo and punch up the choruses with backing vocals.
Dylan filled in the gaps with short bursts of guitar, choking up on
the neck for staccato solos as if he were playing a mandolin. His
mumbling was so rare that when he slurred a line during ``Like a
Rolling Stone,'' the audience burst into applause, as if he were a
jazz singer scatting.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dylan, Simon rearranged his songs, infusing nearly each
one, particularly ``Mrs. Robinson,'' with globe-trotting rhythms
and solos. But unlike Dylan, he left the core of his songs alone,
leaving them recognizable from the first bar. On his first tour
since the early '90s, Simon led a large, rhythm-oriented band _
able to shift easily from zydeco to South African township jive _
letting them carry the weight of the music.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by as many as four percussionists and a three-man brass
section, Simon played music intended to make the audience get up
and dance, whereas Dylan's was oriented more toward looking inside
and thinking. It makes sense, since Dylan is a songwriter who
innovates by looking within while Simon innovates by looking
outside himself, finding music in the street or seeping under the
door, as he sang on ``Late in the Evening.'' Audience members on a
nostalgia trip burst into applause when Simon sang of lighting a
joint in the same song.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlights of Simon's set were not the oldies (even with
his son, Harper, finger-picking ``The Boxer''). They were the songs
from his disastrous recent encounter with Broadway, ``The
Capeman,'' particularly the set's island of soulfulness, ``Born in
Puerto Rico,'' which featured the Panamanian singer Ruben Blades
and the Puerto Rican singer Danny Rivera, and the songs from
``Graceland,'' particularly ``Boy in the Bubble'' and the title
track.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the latter song that the fundamental difference
between Dylan and Simon became clear: with the lyric ``Everybody
feels the wind blow,'' Simon sang of the wind as a connective
tissue not unlike the Brazilian and African rhythms that he has
come to enjoy mining, but Dylan sang of a wind that is elusive,
blowing the answers around and separating us from meaning.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 29: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We live, of course, in a world full of risks and the
probabilities assigned to those risks. There is a statistical
measure for the safety _ or danger, if you're feeling pessimistic _
of nearly any activity you can name. But all these probabilities
and statistical measures are grounded on a basic assumption: the
survival of Earth. You can't take everything for granted, however.
Now, for people who like to worry about the sky falling, there is
the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, created by Dr. Richard P. Binzel, a
professor at MIT, and approved by the International Astronomical
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Torino Impact Hazard Scale measures the likelihood that a
particular extraterrestrial object, like a meteor, comet or
asteroid, will collide with Earth. It uses a scale that runs from
O, a complete miss, to 10, a catastrophic bulls-eye. The Beaufort
scale, which measures wind, the Fujita-Pearson scale (tornadoes),
the Richter scale (earthquakes) and the Saffir-Simpson scale
(hurricanes) calibrate the force of real events, but they do not
gauge the likelihood that they will occur. The Torino Scale is a
way to state only the probability governing a comet, for instance,
once it has been sighted and its trajectory described. The scale
has nothing to say about the possibility of some comet striking the
earth someday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Torino Impact Hazard Scale will not always remedy the
problem it has been devised to solve _ clarifying the likelihood of
catastrophe for worried lay people. The scale is useless without
accurate calculations of trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   For one brief unsettling moment in March last year, it was
thought that asteroid 1997 XF11 might pass very near Earth, perhaps
even striking it, in 2028. Then the trajectory was recalculated,
and it was discovered that, where XF11 was concerned, a miss is as
good as a mile, as good as 600,000 miles, in fact, which is as near
as it will come to Earth. Had Binzel's creation been in effect,
XF11 would have gone from an 8 or so on the Torino Scale to a 0.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that does not convey all the comfort it should, nor does
it do anything to diminish the chance of future miscalculations.
Human error is always likely, though how likely it is always hard
to say. &QL;

MAN GUILTY OF SPREADING AIDS VIRUS SAYS HE HAD HUNDREDS OF SEX

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nushawn J. Williams, the drifter from Brooklyn who
officials say may have infected more than a dozen young women and
girls in upstate New York with the virus that causes AIDS, now says
that he may have had sex with as many as 300 women.
</P>
<P>
   That number is even higher than health officials feared in
October 1997, when their concerns that Williams, was spreading the
virus through a number of rural upstate towns led them to take the
unusual step of publicly identifying him and his health status.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 22, made his remarks in an interview from the Clinton
Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y., that is scheduled to be
broadcast Thursday night on WPIX-TV's ``News at Ten.'' He is
serving a 4- to 12-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to
charges of statutory rape and two counts of reckless endangerment
for knowingly infecting two girls with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   In the first extensive interview since his case attracted
national attention, Williams spoke with a mixture of candor, regret
and braggadocio about his days as a gang member and a drug dealer,
about what he considered his success in attracting scores of women
and his anger at the portrayals of him in the media.
</P>
<P>
   At times he seemed proud of his past (``Basically, it was a life
that was worth living, you know?'') and at other times, his
comments were tinged with regret (``I was living my life in the
fast lane _ now that I think about it, I wish I was living life in
the slow lane.'').
</P>
<P>
   He said he had had sexual partners in New York City and
Rochester as well as in towns in far western New York and as far
away as Charlottesville, Va., and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said Williams could be telling the truth about
the number of sexual contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible,'' said Dr. Robert Berke, the Chautauqua County
health commissioner, whose office did the epidemiological detective
work that identified Williams as the common denominator in the
rapid spread of HIV in the area. ``This guy was extremely active.
We found 47 women here over a long period, but in a couple of
months alone there were 20 contacts. In New York they were looking
at 50 to 75.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Williams appeared to be in denial about his
health status, couching his comments by saying ``If I am
HIV-positive'' and ``I still don't even know if I got it now.''
Despite his guilty plea and the fact that health officials say he
was told in 1996 that he was HIV-positive, he said he did not know
he was positive when he had sex with dozens of girls _ some as
young as 13 _ around the state until his arrest on a drug charge in
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I gave them a death sentence, but it wasn't knowingly,''
he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, whose mother had drug problems, was raised primarily
by his grandmother in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. He
said he began selling drugs upstate because he did not want to be a
burden on his family. There, he said, he found himself unusually
successful with girls who were unhappy with their lives and curious
about his urban roots.
</P>
<P>
   He said the youngest girls he had sex with _ who were only 13 _
had lied to him about their age.
</P>
<P>
   When the interviewer, Jonathan Dienst, asked him if he felt he
owed them an apology, Williams said: ``I think I owe them an
apology as far as having sex without wearing a condom, or not
having safe sex, stuff like that. I owe them an apology on those
grounds.''

YOUTHFUL STOWAWAY DEFIES SECURITY, JETS TO LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A 17-year-old youth with visions of impressing Israeli
spies, cut the razor wire atop a perimeter fence surrounding Logan
International Airport, walked for two miles across restricted
areas, and stowed away aboard a British Airways Boeing 747,
aviation sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The July 12 incident is being investigated by the Federal
Aviation Administration, the Massachusetts Port Authority _ which
owns and operates Logan and is directly responsible for the
airport's perimeter security _ and the airline, which is
responsible for security in its terminal and around its airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The youth, identified by two aviation sources as Abraham Derman
of Brookline, Mass., climbed over the fence and dropped down onto
the tarmac area north of the main terminals before making his trek
to the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The incident raises questions about security at Logan and is
even more troubling because it involved an international flight.
Such flights have long been considered likely targets for terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Massport and at British Airways said the breach was
extremely serious and exceedingly rare. Both have launched
investigations to make certain the event cannot happen again.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of sources say the following occurred:
</P>
<P>
   Derman walked unchallenged for two miles to Terminal E, where he
climbed the exterior stairs of a jetway and boarded British Airways
Flight 214 to London, which departs daily at 8:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior doors on jetways _ which are the responsibility of
the airline _ have combination locks, so either the lock was not
working or was bypassed, the door was propped open, or someone
opened the door to let Derman into the jetway. From there, he was
like just another passenger bound for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Once on board the jumbo jet, Derman apparently headed for the
coach section. The seat he selected was already assigned to another
person and he was asked to move. He calmly headed to the business
section, found an empty seat and sat down for the flight to London.
In business class, Derman had a more comfortable seat, better food,
plus a choice of 12 movies.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, airlines hand count the passengers on board a flight
and compare that number to the number of tickets pulled as
passengers leave the gate area to board the airplane. It is unclear
why the youth was not discovered during that check.
</P>
<P>
   ``British Airways is cooperating fully with Massport and the
FAA,'' said British Airways spokesman John Lampl. ``We are treating
this situation extremely seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the plane landed at London's Heathrow Airport, Derman
somehow gained access to a restricted area at Heathrow and was
confronted by operations officials.
</P>
<P>
   Heathrow, one of the world's busiest airports, has had problems
with security in the past but has become more aggressive. ``I was
there last year and they really put the lid on things,'' said an
aviation security specialist from Maryland who spoke on condition
neither he nor his company be named.
</P>
<P>
   After Derman was discovered, British Airways returned him to
Boston. Upon his arrival here, Derman told investigators he wanted
to go to Israel and he thought the stunt would impress Mossad, the
Israeli intelligence agency. He also said that he initially tried
to gain access to Logan's tarmac by going through Terminal E, but
was stopped and told to leave. He apparently then walked out and
scaled the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Derman could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges have been filed against Derman, and sources
said it is unlikely they will be brought because he is under 18 and
his parents understand the gravity of the situation. The FAA is
considering levying fines, which can be as high as $11,000 per
violation, against the airline, the airport, and Derman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no comment on the specifics, because the matter is
under investigation,'' said FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac. ``But
this would come under airport and air carrier security, and if they
find violations _ and one case can have a number of violations _
there could be fines.''
</P>
<P>
   Massport spokesman Jeremy Crockford said ``We take this very
seriously, but the most important thing to understand is this is an
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing this is unbelievably foolish. He could have been shot,
or killed by a plane, car, or truck out there. In some ways, this
is equivalent to a computer hacker getting into a military
computer. It is a case where a bright young man misused his
talents.''
</P>
<P>
   The aviation security specialist in Maryland said the incident
``has all kinds of interesting failures in it before the system
finally worked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he exploited a weak spot here. After all, he went
through barbed wire and a locked door,'' the specialist said.
</P>
<P>
   At Heathrow, however, he was not permitted to walk the tarmac
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   Derman was returned to Boston on a British Airways flight on
July 13. He flew back in coach, and British Airways is likely to
ask for compensation, a round-trip business class ticket runs
$5,557, unrestricted coach is $1,389.
</P>
<P>
   When Derman flew back in coach, there were no movie choices. The
only selection playing was ``The Out-of-Towners.''

EDITORIAL: THE CENSUS AS AN ACT OF GOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 29: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Acting as though they had just discovered that the Constitution
requires a census every decade, the House Republican leadership has
declared that next year's national headcount will be financed with
an ``emergency'' appropriation of $4.5 billion. The leaders treated
veterans' health care the same way, deeming it an off-budget
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The process of putting together a federal budget is always
untidy, but this year the House Appropriations Committee has been
turned into a wonderland. The unhappy chairman, C.W. Bill Young,
had been warning for months that the spending caps imposed by the
1997 Balanced Budget Act were impossibly rigid, but no one seemed
willing to listen. Both parties happily supported a $15.5 billion
increase in the defense budget, to $266 billion. That used up about
half of the $538 billion set aside for discretionary spending,
painting Young into a corner as the pot available for other
purposes grew smaller and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The unrealistic caps set in 1997 were a classic example of
politicians' tendency to schedule all their really tough challenges
for sometime in the future. President Clinton and leaders from both
parties have been bragging for three years about the way they got
spending under control, even as they began looking for loopholes to
protect themselves from the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress approved ``emergency'' expenditures outside
the caps to the tune of more than $20 billion. This year the House
leaders have already decided to pay for the census with an
emergency appropriation, as if it were a flood or earthquake.
Thanks to an accounting gimmick, additional spending on veterans'
programs is supposed to be financed through the borrowing authority
of the Tennessee Valley Authority. This week GOP leaders were
entertaining a delusion that the nation's Republican governors
would help them out by giving back $6 billion in federal funds the
states received to pay for welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriations battles are part of a larger spectacle of
fiscal irresponsibility, like the Republican leadership's
insistence on a $792 billion tax cut that would eat up a projected
surplus whose size is based, in part, on the same spending cap
fictions that Young is wrestling with. Republican moderates, who
wanted more modest tax reductions, settled for a compromise that
was at best a meaningless fig leaf.
</P>
<P>
   This is the worst kind of budgeting, a cynical exercise in which
both parties try to trick the public into believing that the
government can make Draconian cuts in spending while still
providing the programs people want. Responsible fiscal policy
requires a clear and honest set of numbers, achievable goals and a
willingness to forgo a certain amount of political gamesmanship in
the name of responsible government. None of that is happening in
Washington this year.

TAB FOR WASHINGTON LOBBYING: $1.42 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lobbyists were paid $1.42 billion last year to try
to influence politicians, a 13 percent increase over the $1.26
billion they received in 1997, a research group said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists were paid by organizations of airplane
manufacturers, bankers, doctors and lawyers, drug companies,
hospitals, universities, Indian tribes _ in short, by
representatives of just about any person or institution that had
business before the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly nothing inherently illegitimate about any of
these interests having their voices heard,'' said Paul Hendrie,
communications director for the group, the Center for Responsive
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think so, either,'' said Tom McMahon, a spokesman for
Cassidy &AMP; Associates, which took in $19.9 million in fees last
year. Cassidy dislodged Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP;
Hand as the capital's top lobbying firm by about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hendrie said, the huge sums spent on lobbying are cause
for concern. ``People who don't have the money to spend are not
going to speak with as loud a voice,'' he said. ``Money does
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Through more and more mouths, he might have added. In mid-1997,
there were 14,946 lobbyists registered in Washington, the center's
report said. A year later, there were 18,590 and by June 15 there
were 20,512, or about 38 lobbyists for each of the 535 members of
the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics describes itself as a
nonpartisan, nonprofit research organization that tracks money in
politics, and money's effects on elections and public policy. Its
report was based on disclosures filed with the secretary of the
senate and the clerk of the house under lobbying-disclosure
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrie said his organization was not advocating legislation to
curb lobbyists. As for the money spent by interests trying to have
their way with the federal bureaucracy, he said, ``It's hard to say
what a reasonable figure would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list for the second-straight year was businesses
involved in real estate, insurance and finance, which spent $203
million on lobbying in 1998. (Those businesses, one of 13 broad
economic sectors defined in the report, are also the perennial
leading spenders on campaign contributions, the center said.)
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that money was not always spent to get things
done. Sometimes it was spent in the hope that things would not get
done. Tobacco companies spent $67.4 million on lobbying last year,
nearly double the $38.2 million they spent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Was the money well spent? It is impossible to make a direct
connection, of course, but whatever happened to the bill that would
have raised the tax on cigarettes by $1.10 a pack?
</P>
<P>
   The money spent on lobbying last year also bore more than a
coincidental relationship to important legislation. The American
Hospital Association, for instance, spent just over $10.5 million
in 1998, up from about $7.9 million in 1997, as it lobbied against
Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that Cassidy &AMP; Associates' top client last
year was Boston University, which paid the firm $760,000, and the
biggest single lobbying fee paid in Washington last year was $3.6
million to Verner, Liipfert from Philip Morris.

   NEW YORK _ The Giuliani administration has tentatively agreed to
make crime scenes more accessible to news organizations by changing
police practices that news executives said had inhibited the
coverage of crime, rallies and other events in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed agreement, the Police Department would
significantly limit its use of barricades to keep reporters,
photographers and television camera crews away from crime scenes,
fires, demonstrations and other events.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials also promised to honor police press passes,
which are supposed to permit reporters and camera crews to cross
police and fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   The barricaded areas, known as press pens, have often been set
up a block or more from the site of an event, sometimes making it
impossible for reporters to gather information and for
photographers and television camera crews to capture images of
crime scenes, fires and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Drafts of the tentative agreement were made available Wednesday
by lawyers for a coalition of news organizations. It still faces
review by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani before it can become final.
</P>
<P>
   News executives have complained since 1995 about the barricades
and about what they say is a pattern of harassment of news
gatherers by the police. Police officers have sometimes
deliberately blocked news photographers and television camera crews
from taking pictures or videotape of crime scenes, auto accidents
and even parades.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, news executives said, the media had less access to
public events than New Yorkers who simply happened to walk by the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The news organizations contended that the Police Department's
actions repeatedly violated its own media guidelines, as well as
the news media's First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement resulted from negotiations between city
officials and a coalition representing The Daily News, The New York
Times, Newsday, The Associated Press and the New York Press Club.
The coalition had been preparing to sue the city in federal court
over the lack of access to crime scenes, demonstrations and other
public events.

FUROR OVER FLAG TRAILS GIULIANI ON FUND-RAISING VISIT TO THE SOUTH
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ As he pumped hands and collected donations in
three Southern cities Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also found
himself fending off criticism from politicians back home who were
incensed by his decision to fly the Arkansas flag over City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani announced during his visit to Little Rock, Ark., on
Tuesday that he would briefly fly the star-studded scarlet flag
over City Hall to thank his Republican hosts for their hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Giuliani's aides raised an Arkansas flag over City
Hall in New York, leading several Democratic lawmakers to fire off
statements of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone called the flag-hoisting
blatantly political, saying its presence atop City Hall had no
purpose other than to taunt Hillary Rodham Clinton, the mayor's
potential opponent in next year's race for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Bill Perkins, who is black, went further, complaining
that the Arkansas flag was ``designed to commemorate the
Confederacy.'' According to the state's Web site, three stars below
the word Arkansas on the flag represent the three nations that have
held sway there _ Spain, France and the United States _ and a
single star above symbolizes the Confederacy, which the state was
part of from 1861 to 1865.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone tracked the mayor down by telephone Wednesday morning
and insisted that he immediately order that the flag be taken down.
Giuliani refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the speaker this morning he should send that objection
to President Clinton,'' Giuliani, who also visited Huntsville and
Tuscaloosa on Wednesday, said during a news conference at a hotel
here before a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner. ``The flag of the
state of Arkansas has been displayed in the White House and flown
throughout Washington, D.C., without objection.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who flew home Wednesday, originally said the flag
would fly for a few days, but Wednesday afternoon, he announced
that it would come down that night. ``I think we are making a lot
out of nothing because it is probably a very slow news day,''
Giuliani said in response to reporters' questions about the flag
controversy. ``But I have it in perspective. This is the silliness
of partisan politics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Back in New York, aides on both sides of City Hall pored over
the city's administrative code to determine who has authority over
flag-flying. Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota accused the City Council of
``parochialism'' and ``closed mindedness.''
</P>
<P>
   He also distributed copies of Section 3-102 of Chapter 1 of the
administrative code. It says: ``All authority to display flags or
other decorations on, in or about the public buildings within the
City Hall Park is vested in the mayor, unless otherwise ordered by
the Council.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council, Lhota contended, could not issue an order
until its next full meeting on Aug. 11. He also pointed out that
other flags have flown over City Hall to honor dignitaries and that
in 1994, the flag of Texas flew there after the Houston Rockets
defeated the Knicks in the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, a spokesman for Gov. Mike Huckabee said that only
the Stars and Stripes, along with the Arkansas flag, flew over the
state Capitol during the mayor's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Rex Nelson, said he did not expect the flag issue
to interest people in Little Rock much. ``I have a feeling it's not
an issue that reverberates with anybody outside maybe two of the
five boroughs'' of New York City, he said.

<P>
   As quietly and as unassumingly as he entered the NFL, Barry
Sanders has left it, simply issuing a statement Wednesday that he
is retiring after 10 seasons as a Detroit Lions running back.
</P>
<P>
   His statement, in part, read:
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I officially declare my departure from the NFL. I leave
on good terms with everyone in the organization. The reason I am
retiring is simple: My desire to exit the game is greater than my
desire to remain in it. I have searched my heart through and
through and feel comfortable with this decision. I wish my
teammates, coaches and the entire Lions organization all the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Little fanfare. No glitzy news conference. Just a written
statement and then, like one of his shimmering runs, poof! He was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was spotted Wednesday outside London at Gatwick Airport
after having arrived from Detroit. ``I'm going into retirement, and
I don't see my plans changing,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would spend two days in London before visiting
Amsterdam and Paris. Asked why he happened to be in London, Sanders
answered: ``I don't know the right way to retire. This is just my
way of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sanders says his career is over, is it really over?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on the `Reserve: Did Not Report' list, not the `Reserve:
Retired' list,'' said Chuck Schmidt, the Lions' general manager,
noting that if Sanders chooses to be activated any time before Dec.
5 he would be eligible for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of trying to trade him,'' Schmidt said.
``If Barry comes back, we would want him to come back to the
Detroit Lions.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not seem likely to Bobby Ross, the Lions' head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're very disappointed because we lose a great
player,'' he said. ``From what I know about Barry, when he makes up
his mind, he makes up his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a puzzling situation.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 31, is still in the prime of his career despite having
played a decade, and he is only 1,457 yards shy of breaking Walter
Payton's career rushing record of 16,726 yards. He shows no hint of
slowing or of his sparkling skills waning. He is the premier
running back in the NFL and one its brightest stars.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit was 78-82 during Sanders' 10 seasons. The Lions had five
seasons in the playoffs, five seasons out and a 1-5 record in
playoff games. They had five consecutive playoff losses, too, with
the lone victory coming more than seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Ross was hired as head coach. He ran Sanders sparingly
for the first two games. Over the remaining 14 games of the regular
season, however, Sanders, Ross, his coaching staff and the Detroit
offensive line rolled, as Sanders became only the third player in
league history to rush for more than 2,000 yards, joining Eric
Dickerson and O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   It was something on which to build.
</P>
<P>
   But last season there were more changes to the offensive line, a
quarterback change (from the veteran Scott Mitchell to the rookie
Charlie Batch two games into the season) and more Lions mediocrity.
Ross blew up over the mess, blamed the players more than the
coaching, and the Lions tumbled again. There was consternation over
whether Sanders was more effective in a one-back or two-back set,
although the Lions generally used two backs.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he called Sanders, who has played two years of a
six-year $36 million contract, at least 10 times during the
off-season and sent him him ``three or four personal, handwritten
letters each five to nine pages in length.'' But Sanders never
responded, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   William Sanders, Barry's father, said during the off-season that
his son was ``sick of the Lions. He's sick of losing. He's sick of
the whole situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he would like for Sanders to let him know by July 1 if
he planned to retire, so that the Lions could plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders decided one day before the start of Detroit's training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a state of shock,'' Lions receiver Johnnie Morton
said. ``This puts us in a pinch.''
</P>
<P>
   Do his teammates feel betrayed?
</P>
<P>
   ``You wish he had done it a different way,'' Batch said. ``But
maybe he didn't know until this weekend what he was really going to
do, so that would explain him waiting so long to announce this. I'm
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was seen in the Detroit area within the past week by
Lions coaches and players. They thought that was a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he is gone.
</P>
<P>
   His father hinted last May that it could happen this way. Few
took him seriously then, but many do now. This is what William
Sanders said:
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do just like Jim Brown did in '65 _ walk away from the
game and never let it faze him.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that someday Barry Sanders simply may not show up. That
day has come.

ROGERS _ HAMSTRING IN DOUBT _ PITCHES AN EFFECTIVE SIX INNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kenny Rogers trotted to the mound Wednesday, hoping
for a fresh start with the Mets in an old city. It was a new team
in a new borough and in a new league, but there were still the old
yet valid questions about whether Rogers could succeed as a pitcher
in New York after faltering with the Yankees in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As Rogers tossed his first warm-up pitches at Shea Stadium,
``Bittersweet Symphony'' by the Verve played on the public-address
system. Richard Ashcroft's vocals were appropriate for Rogers'
debut with the Mets because the song includes the lyrics, ``I can
change, I can change, I can change.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Rogers can change. He pitched artistically and
effectively, allowing the Pittsburgh Pirates no earned runs and one
hit in six innings before leaving because of tightness in his right
hamstring. Rogers left with a one-run lead, but didn't get the
victory because Dennis Cook gave up a home run to John Wehner that
tied the score before the Mets used a seven-run eruption in the
eighth to secure a 9-2 triumph. Benny Agbayani's double delivered
the go-ahead run, while Rey Ordonez and Edgardo Alfonzo drove in
two runs each in the outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Rogers, obtained in a trade with the Oakland A's
last week, did not get a decision and conceded that his strained
hamstring may persist, it was a rewarding day. Rogers notched 12 of
18 outs on grounders, displayed a tricky sinker, a nifty curveball
and an effective changeup, and he might have flirted with a
no-hitter were it not for a questionable umpiring call that
prolonged an inning.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mets were smiling. Sort of. Manager Bobby Valentine
called Rogers a warrior and praised his performance, but cautioned
that the 34-year-old left-hander might miss a start because of his
hamstring. Rogers does not think he will miss a turn, but he
grimaced in the dugout, limped in the clubhouse and bent his leg so
his knee could rest on a suitcase during interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw six innings of one-hit ball,'' Valentine said.
``Don't get me wrong; it's not like he was out there pitching with
a bloody stump. But there was a lot of trepidation in my viewing of
what if, what if, what if. When you go six, seven innings and
you're waiting for something bad to happen, it's a lousy feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers did not argue when Valentine removed him with a 2-1 lead,
but he was ready for the seventh. Valentine called Rogers' injury
the worst kind to decipher because he must rely on the player to
get information, which can sometimes be a problem with Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has pitched in pain before and even angered Yankee
Manager Joe Torre by disguising the extent of a spring training
shoulder injury in 1996. Valentine spoke of how the Mets needed
Rogers ``for the long term,'' and how having six starters would
make it easier to skip him if the tightness in his hamstring did
not ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could be a lingering problem, but I think today and
being able to get through it, was a big plus,'' Rogers said.
``Knowing I can go out there and compete with it, even if it's
still there. I really wanted to pitch longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years to the day after Rogers became the first American
League left-hander to pitch a perfect game, as a member of the
Texas Rangers, he was nearly flawless for the Mets. Rogers broke
off a 3-2 curve to Brian Giles in the first that looked so much
like a strike that he ambled off the mound. It was called a ball.
Kevin Young singled, which was Pittsburgh's only hit off Rogers,
but he retired Ed Sprague on a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo and Robin Ventura blasted homers off Todd Ritchie in the
first inning to give the Mets a 2-0 lead. While catcher Todd Pratt
noticed Rogers favoring his hamstring in the second and said it
kept him from finishing breaking pitches, Rogers still retired 12
of 13 from the second until the fifth. Rogers actually tweaked his
hamstring when he sacrificed in the fifth and ran to first. He was
being too feisty and stopped after 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, with a runner on second, Rogers flipped a
pickoff throw to Ordonez that sailed into center field. Rogers said
that Andre the Giant could not have caught the errant throw, which
played a part in Pittsburgh's first run. It was obvious Rogers was
hurting, but it was also obvious that he had conquered New York for
a day. ``There are always pressures,'' Rogers said. ``I think
because you're in New York, it's a little more pressurized with
everybody watching. For me, as long as I'm able to go out there and
show I'm healthy, I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Rogers must get healthy, which was why Valentine
bolted out of his office and gave his new pitcher magnets to apply
to his hamstring. Valentine tore the magnets from a sheet and
instructed Rogers on where to put them. All the while, Rogers
smiled. It was the end of a day that was a new beginning, and
Rogers, injury and all, was pleased. ``Give me that stuff,'' Rogers
said. ``It's like voodoo, man.''

HARRY (SWEETS) EDISON, 83, TRUMPETER FOR BASIE BAND, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry (Sweets) Edison, a member of the Count Basie band from
1938 to 1950 and a trumpeter of original, minimalist conviction who
played behind singers like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and
Frank Sinatra, died on Tuesday at his home in Columbus, Ohio. He
was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz is full of lunging, piercing talents, and Edison's niche
was to act as a cool-headed counterweight to that tendency. In the
Basie band, he had a supple, warm sound, regulated by a fanned
mute, and he often stayed on repeated notes which he would bend and
ripple; his obbligato playing, while accompanying a soloist, was
sometimes indistinguishable from his own spotlighted
improvisations. As he grew older, the notes became shorter, his
tone became softer, and the listener had to follow him into a kind
of secret, hidden world. Often he would end a piece with one
repeated note or riff that gradually faded into silence.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the sound of resignation; his music wasn't sad, but
funny and sweet. The saxophonist Lester Young must have been
thinking of this when, sitting in the lobby of New York's Woodside
Hotel in the 1930s, he nicknamed Edison ``Sweetie-Pie.'' That was
soon shortened to Sweets, which would identify him for the rest of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Edison was born in Columbus. His father, a Zuni Indian named
Wayne Edison, left the family when he was 6 months old. Young Harry
then lived with relatives in Kentucky, where an uncle gave him his
first trumpet and taught him scales at the age of 10. After he
returned to Columbus to live with his mother, he played the trumpet
in school bands.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of high school, he joined Earl Hood's band in
Columbus, and in 1933 he joined the Jeter-Pillars Orchestra in
Cleveland, which moved to St. Louis one year later. In 1937 he
finally landed in New York, playing in Lucky Millinder's trumpet
section. At a battle of the bands at the Armory in Baltimore,
according to Count Basie's memoir, ``Good Morning Blues,'' the
Millinder group played in a tight competition against Basie's band.
Not long after, Edison defected to the New York-based Count Basie
camp.
</P>
<P>
   His timing was perfect: the band was at a high point, with the
recent arrival of the arranger Eddie Durham, and the tenor
saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans accumulating notoriety
for their nightly musical battles. It was during this period that
the Basie band recorded dozens of famous pieces _ including ``Every
Tub,'' ``Swingin' the Blues'' and ``Sent for You Yesterday'' _
models of directness, economy and hard swing.
</P>
<P>
   As some classic recordings with Billie Holiday in the late 1930s
would begin to prove (including ``The Man I Love''), Edison was
particularly good behind singers, negotiating around their
breathing space and spurring on their sense of rhythm. Nelson
Riddle, who used him many times in the studio, said that Edison was
often directly responsible for leavening the mood on a record.
``The humor is in Harry's head,'' he once said. ``You show him what
you want, you delineate the area that he's going to play in, and
he's the one who actually makes the humor of the comment. You just
show him where.'' Some of Edison's work is found on Frank Sinatra's
mid-1950s albums, including ``Swing Easy'' and ``Songs for Swingin'
Lovers,'' and the Billie Holiday album ``Songs for Distingue
Lovers.'' Edison also worked with Sarah Vaughan and Nat (King)
Cole.
</P>
<P>
   When Basie's band broke up in 1950, Edison moved to Los Angeles
where he found studio work. He traveled with Norman Granz's Jazz at
the Philharmonic tours and was the musical director for Josephine
Baker in the early 1950s. He played with big bands led by Buddy
Rich, Quincy Jones, Louis Bellson and Henry Mancini, and until the
end of his life, he made many solo albums for the Pablo, Candid and
Concord record labels, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Edison was named an American Jazz Master, and he
frequently toured. To the end, even when his energy failed him, he
knew how to use what he had, which was a sort of rhythmic tension
based in the language of the riff and the repeated single note; he
could kick a band into swinging while playing as lightly as one
can. And he was always funny, with a routine of double-entendres on
song titles and hyperbolically lavish self-introductions at the end
of a set. In December he moved back to Columbus from Los Angeles
because of failing health; he had been living with cancer for 14
years. His last recording is ``Live at the Iridium,'' on Telarc
Records.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Helena, of Columbus.

9 ENTER NO-CONTEST PLEAS IN UCLA PARKING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine UCLA football players pleaded no contest
Wednesday to illegally obtaining handicapped parking placards, and
were sentenced to fines, community service and probation. And later
in the day, the school suspended those still on the team for the
first two games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   As the players emerged from the courthouse, a handful of
protesters in wheelchairs outside chanted, ``Hey hey, ho ho,
parking cheats must go.''
</P>
<P>
   In a late-morning arraignment near the Men's Central Jail, nine
of the 14 players charged in the case quietly entered their pleas
and each was sentenced to two years' probation, a $500 fine that
will increase to $1,500 with penalties and fees and 200 hours of
community service to be split evenly between the Special Olympics
and other charities. The players will also spend a day in a
sensitivity program talking to disabled people and their advocates.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the pleas, a second count of giving false
information to the California Department of Motor Vehicles was
dropped. The hearings of the five other current and former players
were postponed until Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Abdul Azziz, a reserve outside linebacker last season, read
a statement for the players in which he said that the placards were
used only as a substitute for regular student-parking permits,
which cost $129 to $162 a quarter, and that players mostly did not
displace disabled drivers by parking in handicapped spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to apologize to our school, our teammates and
most importantly the disabled community,'' Azziz said. ``We did not
realize the seriousness of our actions. If we had realized then how
offensive our actions were to the disabled community or anyone
else, we would never have committed these acts. We realize we
exercised bad judgment, and we're anxious to make amends for what
we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine players, including seven of those sentenced Wednesday, are
returning to school and will be suspended from playing in the first
two games of the season, Albert Carnesale, the UCLA chancellor,
said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. They will also
receive additional penalties students face in such cases, ranging
from disciplinary probation to suspension from school. Six of the
players were projected as starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This behavior is particularly insensitive because it was
carried out by student-athletes, for they are among the most
able-bodied of all,'' Carnesale said.
</P>
<P>
   Illegally possessing handicapped parking placards is a
misdemeanor which carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail
and a $1,000 fine. Brian Williams, the deputy city attorney who
prosecuted the case, said, ``We think this is a very fair and just
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Harland Braun, a lawyer who represented six players, said they
may have entered no contest pleas believing that guilty pleas might
affect the school's disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   The players were charged earlier this month after an
investigation by University of California campus police found that
they submitted applications to the Department of Motor Vehicles
citing made-up physical handicaps _ including one who said he
suffered from Bell's Palsy, a facial nerve ailment _ and bearing
signatures from nonexistent physicians.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to the investigation said the inquiry was
continuing and that more charges were possible. The Los Angeles
Times has reported that UCLA's star quarterback last year, Cade
McNown, had a placard in 1997 when he was fit enough to be
practicing with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Sam Ohta postponed hearings for the five other players. A
lawyer for Craig Walendy, a senior fullback last season, said he
was at the San Francisco 49ers' training camp and could not be in
court Wednesday. Another player, Mark Raynosa, a senior
special-teams player last season, asked the judge for more time to
hire a lawyer. Raynosa would not say how he intended to plead.

ON PRO BASKETBALL: RADOJEVIC FAR FROM HOME BUT CLOSER TO SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few days after he was drafted into the NBA, Aleksandar
Radojevic took a flight from New York to Los Angeles to compete in
the Long Beach Summer League.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-3-inch center, taken 12th overall by the Toronto
Raptors, was dreading the six-hour flight. Until Adam Sandler
walked up and introduced himself to the native of Montenegro, a
region of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good guy,'' Radojevic said in broken English of
Sandler, the actor and comedian. ``Very funny. He make jokes for
long time. I tell him I want to see `Big Daddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Big Alek may be better theater. In November, he is coming to an
NBA arena near you, the towering project of the Raptors. He will
most likely not win the rookie of the year award, and who knows how
long before he transforms himself into a decent young center and
learns the ways of a veteran. But he is patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Charles Oakley,'' he said. ``If he is in Toronto, I hope
he can teach me. Some people tell me he can help me go shopping for
new clothes, but I feel the colors he wear are too bright.''
</P>
<P>
   He uses humor well to camouflage the grimmer parts of his
odyssey. Because of the war in the Balkans, Radojevic has not gone
home since coming to the United States two years and three months
ago. Radojevic, who was 20 when he left Montenegro, spoke no
English then. He played at Barton County Community College in
Kansas the past two seasons, averaging 15.4 points, 9.0 rebounds
and once blocking 12 shots in a single game. His home country's
instability forced him to stay in Kansas even when his father died
last season at age 67.
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic had signed a letter of intent to play for Ohio State.
But on May 11, the NCAA ruled that because Radojevic received
$13,000 for playing a total of 19 minutes for a Yugoslav club team
two years ago, he was ineligible to play for the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA didn't want him. He could not go back home because it
meant he might be drafted into the Yugoslav army and perhaps be
sent to fight in Kosovo. He needed a new home, and the NBA obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked out for 17 teams,'' said his agent, Marc Cornstein.
``I would be fired if I suggested that to most kids, but he knew
not a lot of them had seen him play. Instead of complaining, he
persevered. He's the most quality kid I've ever had, just a
genuinely good person. And he's got an incredible sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he didn't know English real well, he would spend all his
time in Kansas watching TV. His favorite show is `Sanford &AMP; Son.' I
heard his first words in America were, `Show me the money!'''
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic is Cornstein's first bona fide, big-time client. A
28-year-old Cornell graduate, Cornstein also works as a
commissioner for the New York State Athletic Commission and for the
New York City Sports Commission while trying to run his own one-man
agent business.
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic said the relationship he shares with Cornstein is
similar to the one between Cuba Gooding Jr. and Tom Cruise in
``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even better than that relationship from the movie,'' Radojevic
said. ``He talk about my job, but mostly we are good friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Falk, he don't have that relationship with his players
that I have with Mark,'' Radojevic added, referring to the game's
most prominent agent. ``It's more than business. I can tell him my
personal problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic hopes to bring the rest of his family to the United
States from Montenegro within the next three years. He knows if his
NBA career does not pan out, there are limited options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for me,'' he said. ``I have a lot of memories,
but I got to do what I got to do. I'm not going back. There is
nothing for me there now. As soon as I bring my family here, there
is no concern left for me.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the draft last month in Washington, two women
who worked for the NBA and had followed Radojevic's story began
crying as Radojevic's name was announced by Commissioner David
Stern. Radojevic was one of the last players to leave the MCI
Center. Cornstein had another client he had hoped would be picked
in the second round, and Radojevic was enjoying the moment.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left, the television crews were cleaning up and
the restaurants were closed. He wanted something to eat, so he and
his agent and two family friends went to the Renaissance Hotel,
where the league had a buffet for its employees and the news media.
Radojevic later retreated to the news-media hospitality room, a
first for an NBA draftee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is smart,'' he said. ``I knew if I do something stupid,
it will be in newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he put two bottles of Budweiser up to his mouth at once
and starting pouring and smiling. ``I was so happy to be in the
NBA,'' he said. ``I can't imagine my life with no laughing. The
most important thing in my job is when tough times come, I keep
good attitude and be happy. That is what's going to keep me in this
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Aleksandar Radojevic could not return home and could
not play college basketball anymore. Today, he is less than three
months away from his first Toronto training camp. They always talk
about players joining the NBA family. Never has there been a
7-footer more thrilled to meet his new cousins.

SEATTLE LAWYER NOMINATED FOR 9TH CIRCUIT JUDGESHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ President Clinton has picked Richard Tallman, a
longtime Seattle lawyer who specialized in white collar criminal
defense, to fill a vancancy on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Tallman was one of three potential nominees recommended to the
White House by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., after Washington state
Supreme Court Justice Barbara Durham withdrew her name from
consideration for the post.
</P>
<P>
   He is likely to be formally nominated after a required FBI
background check. Two other nominations _ Seattle lawyer Ron Gould
to the 9th Circuit and King County Superior Court Judge Marsha
Pechman to U.S. District Court _ are awaiting confirmation by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I add Richard Tallman's name to Marsha Pechman and Ron Gould
on a list of terrific judicial candidates from Washington state. I
hope Dick's nomination moves along quickly,'' said Sen. Patty
Murray, D-Wash, who endorsed Gorton's list of nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 9th Circuit position has been open for far too long, and
it is unfortunate the process was delayed,'' Murray added.
</P>
<P>
   Tallman was longtime chairman of the white-collar criminal
defense group at Bogle &AMP; Gates, a major Seattle law firm that
closed March 31. He is a partner in the recently formed firm of
Tallman &AMP; Severin.
</P>
<P>
   Tallman once represented the Seattle Mariners baseball team in
legal disputes over scheduling rights in the Kingdome. He has
handled medical malpractice and defense procurement cases..
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be listened to. He reasons well and he is not
automatically liberal or conservative,'' said Frederic Tausend, a
former law school dean and partner at Preston Ellis &AMP; Gates, who
has practiced with Tallman.
</P>
<P>
   Tallman was once a law clerk for U.S. District Court Judge
Morell Sharp, and is a graduate of Northwestern Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Based in San Francisco, although several of its judges sit in
Seattle, the 9th Circuit court is a key decision-maker in the
West's major economic, social and environmental conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The court upheld President Clinton's forest protection plan, but
recently ruled against a major land exchange between Weyerhaeuser
and the U.S. Forest Service. Overruling a district judge, it upheld
Washington state's law against assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit is currently deciding an
Exxon Corp. appeal of a $5.1 billion judgment in a suit brought by
Alaska fishermen over the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   The court is home to several of the nation's most outspokenly
conservative judges _ and more liberal jurists. Its ideological
balance has led to fierce confirmation fights in the Senate. Seven
seats on the 28-member court are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was given a leading role in filling the appellate court
vacancy as a result of an agreement worked out between the GOP
senator and White House Counsel Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Gorton withdrew his threat to block Senate
confirmation of Clinton's federal judicial nominations in the
Northwest. The Republican-controlled Senate confirmed several of
the president's nominees, while Gorton was given a voice in picking
federal judges in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancy on the 9th Circuit was created by the retirement of
longtime Judge Betty Fletcher of Seattle. University of California
law Professor William Fletcher, the judge's son, was confirmed last
year to a San Francisco-based seat on the appellate court. Several
Republican senators had objected to having mother and son on the
same federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-controlled Senate has moved at a glacial pace this year
in confirming judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   It has confirmed only five of Clinton's 45 judicial nominees.
One of the judges to win confirmation was a college fraternity
brother of Senate Majority leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Several other appointees have been approved by the Senate
Judiciary Committee and await a vote by the full Senate. One of
them is Pechman, who is expected to win confirmation with little
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But one nominee to the 9th Circuit, Judge Richard Paez in
California, has waited three and a half years for a hearing. Gould,
of Seattle, was tapped to the federal appellate court in November
1997, but has yet to receive a hearing by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   One major roadblock was cleared on Wednesday. Bowing to pressure
from Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
Clinton on Wednesday nominated a conservative Republican lawyer
from Utah, Ted Stewart, to a U.S. District Court vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch had broadly hinted that he was holding up confirmation
hearings of Clinton's nominees until the president agreed to
nominate Stewart, a friend of the senator's.

EDITORIAL: AN ASTHMA EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 29:
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the respiratory system that
makes breathing difficult, and in its acute forms starves its
victims of air, landing them in the hospital. The disease has
become increasingly common, afflicting more than twice as many
people today _ about a third of them children _ as it did just two
decades ago. Unless scientists find out why _ and learn to curb the
increase _ asthma will clog hospital emergency rooms and undermine
the national effort to control health costs.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been known that poor children are more likely to
suffer acute asthma attacks that require hospitalization than more
affluent youngsters. But the extent of the disparity was documented
this week when a study of New York City by the Mount Sinai School
of Medicine found that hospitalization rates for acute asthma were
as much as 20 times higher in poor, minority communities than in
affluent ones.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the disease is easily controllable through medication
and life-style choices, the differences suggest that the poor and
their families lack access to both advanced care and accurate
information about this chronic disorder. They may also be more
exposed to possible environmental determinants of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of asthma are still a mystery. Airborne pollutants
might play a role. The fact that children remain indoors more than
in the past _ where they are subject to a variety of pollutants in
inferior housing _ is also being considered. New York City, which
has three times the national hospitalization rate, is the perfect
laboratory for investigating the causes of this problem and the
means of solving it.

COMATOSE WOMAN'S FETUS FOCUS OF BATTLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo available on NYT database) 
(Eds.: Sub to include brother's quotes, woman's criminal record.) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Texas man is involved in a potentially
precedent-setting legal fight to keep a 15-week fetus alive in the
womb of a comatose woman who may be legally brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Law, 35, of Houston claims he is the biological father of
the fetus and the common-law husband of Tammy Martin, 34, who fell
into a coma July 18, apparently after a blood vessel in her brain
ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   Law believes that officials at Memorial Hospital Northwest in
Houston are conspiring with Martin's parents to allow her and the
fetus to die and prevent his participating in the decision-making
process.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Scott Link on Friday issued a temporary
restraining order preventing the hospital from withdrawing any
life-support treatment until a further hearing Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, when we had our first meeting, they said maybe it's
best to let the baby go, that they had already made funeral
arrangements,'' a distraught Law said at his attorney's office this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby means everything to me, I've never had any children.
I feel the baby has every right to have a chance to live. They
develop technology to be able to make things happen like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's stepfather, J.D. Cox, 58, of Brackettville in South
Texas, acknowledged that he wants his daughter taken off life
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the little baby to go to heaven with her mama,''
said Cox, who married Martin's mother, Joyce Cox, 28 years ago.
``That's not God's work to keep a woman alive when she's already
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said Martin was an alcoholic and a cocaine addict. Doctors
have told him the fetus would likely have severe problems such as
retardation or deformities if it survives to when it could be
removed from the womb at about 25-28 weeks into the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've told me there's already four strikes against the baby
because she was a cocaine addict, an alcoholic, she's brain-dead
and the baby will be premature,'' Cox said. ``If the doctors assure
us the baby will have 10 fingers and 10 toes, we might
reconsider.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Martin, the brother of Tammy Martin, said Wednesday that
his sister got pregnant to try to stay out of prison and wanted to
get an abortion when the ploy failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tammy ended up getting pregnant because she thought it meant
she wouldn't have go to jail, but then she found out that wasn't
the case,'' said Lonnie Martin, 40, of nearby Splendora.
</P>
<P>
   His contentions could have legal ramifications in the dispute
over whether she should be kept alive by artificial means to try to
save the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Martin was charged in September 1995 with intentionally
and knowingly injuring a child. She pled guilty to a lesser charge,
reckless injury to a child, and was given probation. But in June
1996 she was convicted of driving while intoxicated and criminal
mischief for ``striking a car with a car jack,'' according to court
records. Her probation was revoked, and last week an appellate
court upheld the prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Riddlebarger, spokeswoman for the Memorial-Hermann
Healthcare System, said she could only offer a few comments because
of confidentiality rules. Hospital attorneys were not present
during the temporary-restraining order hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Riddlebarger said the mother and fetus are receiving ``the
highest level of medical care'' and that a test to determine if
Martin is brain-dead has not been done for medical reasons. She
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Law and Cox said the test was planned for last week. Law said
doctors called it off after he raised concerns that it might harm
the fetus, and Cox said the restraining order has shied doctors
away from performing the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise (if the test was done), we could have had all this
terminated. I had the funeral all paid,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Heitman, associate professor of ethics at UT-Houston
Health Science Center, said a fetus so young will generally have a
difficult time developing properly if the mother is in a coma. She
said she is aware of only one similar case _ in Germany two years
ago when doctors kept a woman artificially alive to try to save a
16-week-old fetus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody (mother and fetus) died,'' Heitman said. ``When you
have a mother with profound neurological damage, it affects other
organs, and the other organs affect development.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he does not want to discuss in detail what caused
Martin's injury, because Cox may be trying to file criminal charges
against him. Law claims Martin hit her head against a car door
before going to sleep and seemed fine until she started throwing up
in the morning and losing consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told him he had no way of knowing what had happened to
Martin and that he did everything he could, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox said he plans at the least to file negligent homicide
charges because Law should have brought Martin to the hospital
sooner. He claims Law possibly hit Martin on the head and is trying
to prevent her from being ruled brain-dead because he fears an
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Law said the allegations are absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Death Act establishes procedures that protect
doctors and hospitals from lawsuits when withholding life-support
care to terminally ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, if a patient ruled to be terminally ill did not
previously specify whether he or she should be kept alive
artificially, ``surrogate decision-makers'' are empowered to make
such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Law's attorney, Jared Woodfill, said a spouse has the top
priority as a surrogate decision-maker, and that under Texas law a
common-law husband has the same rights as a legally married spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Riddlebarger said Memorial-Hermann recognizes a common-law
marriage only if the couple has filed such a declaration with a
court or if a court orders that the marriage be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill said that under Texas law, common-law marriages can be
declared if a couple lives together and agrees to present
themselves as wife and husband. He said Law and Martin met the
criteria and he will ask a judge Aug. 5 to rule his client to be
Martin's common-law husband.
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill said Law cannot now assert his legal rights as the
biological father, because the fetus is not born.
</P>
<P>
   Until the temporary restraining order was granted, Law said,
hospital officials kept him in the dark about Martin's treatment
because they considered him simply a ``boyfriend.'' He said he has
not been granted access to her medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Law said he and Martin lived together the last 10 months and
exchanged wedding rings because they intended to marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't really hit me that she might die,'' Law sobbed. ``I
don't know if I can live without her, she was my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cox said he will contest Law's claim to be the common-law
husband.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ben Bruce, with whom Martin had lived for more than
seven years, may be the biological father and will soon file legal
papers demanding DNA testing and that Bruce be declared the
common-law husband.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce acknowledged he plans to file a legal claim ``as a
family'' with the Coxes, but declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to be declared the father so he can let the baby
die,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was facing two years in prison after pleading guilty to
reckless injury to a minor. She was charged with injecting cocaine
into Bruce's minor daughter and then violated her probation.
</P>
<P>
   Another legal issue is a provision in the Texas Natural Death
Act that states, ``(A) person may not withdraw or withhold
life-sustaining procedures under this chapter from a pregnant
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodfill claims this means that the hospital must keep Martin
alive because she is pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Riddlebarger said hospital attorneys told her the law is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that for the first two days after Martin was admitted
to the hospital, officials told him they had to keep her alive
because she is pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that as long as the fetus had a heartbeat, their
hands were tied,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   But on the third day, he said, hospital officials told him they
consulted with their ``legal team'' and determined that treatment
could be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Law said he never heard about these discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Baruch Brody, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and
Health Policy at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said
attorneys frequently interpret the provision to mean treatment may
not be withheld from pregnant women. But as an ethicist, he prefers
to interpret it to mean that the law does not apply to pregnant
women.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, he said, means that doctors treating terminally
ill pregnant women are not protected from liability by the state
law and must decide whether to continue or stop treatment based on
common-law rights.

EDITORIAL: WHERE THERE'S SMOKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 29: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the mysterious ways of Albany, an extension of New York's
feeble lobbying law is now poised for approval by state
legislators. This cowardly measure to rubber-stamp the state's
lobbying code for four more years has no identifiable sponsors,
perhaps an indication that even in Albany the system is recognized
as an embarrassment. New York state's lobbying law does not work,
and if the Legislature needs any more evidence of how the public is
being hijacked by special interests, the tobacco industry offers a
ripe example.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in Monday's Times by Clifford Levy, Philip Morris
has spent tens of thousands of dollars in recent years providing
many of New York's legislators with lavish dinners, as well as
tickets to events like the Indianapolis 500 and Lincoln Center
concerts. This bounty was not revealed in the company's lobbying
reports in Albany but surfaced in documents submitted as part of
lawsuits against the tobacco interests in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The company's court documents cited dinners and gifts to
Albany's legislative leaders, including Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno. Raymond
Harding, the Liberal Party leader and a close adviser to Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, received $12,500 a month from 1994 to 1998 as a
``government consultant'' for the company, a fee Harding says was
for legal advice. Harding also says he does not lobby for Philip
Morris in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The state's lobbying commission is investigating Philip Morris,
but even if the company has underreported its gift-giving, the
present law offers little punishment. A fine can be easily avoided
by acknowledging the error on the state lobbying forms within three
days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, legislators and Gov. George Pataki are squabbling
about how much of the state's share of a tobacco settlement should
be applied to an effective anti-smoking effort. Whether there is a
connection between Albany's casual approach to tobacco and the many
meals for legislators courtesy of Philip Morris would be hard to
prove. But the possibility of such coziness deserves to be
addressed, with more powers for the lobbying commission, a broader
definition of lobbying and limits on gifts and favors.
</P>
<P>
   A mere extension of the lobbying law means another defeat for
the ordinary citizen. The governor and the Legislature should
strengthen the state's lobbying code to bring it on a par with
those in states like Connecticut and Minnesota. Failure to reform
the law is another signal that the State Legislature prefers a
pliable, muddled system that allows politicians to accept favors
without fear of official scrutiny or public awareness.

   Anne Richardson, former chairwoman of Reading Is Fundamental,
the nation's largest organization promoting children's literacy,
died on Monday at a hospital in Cheverly, Md. She was 69 and lived
in Mitchellville, Md., a Washington suburb, with her husband,
former Attorney General Elliot Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications of Alzheimer's disease,
said her son Henry.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richardson was a founding member of Reading Is Fundamental
and served as its chairwoman from 1981 to 1996. By the time she
stepped down, the number of children the organization was serving
had grown to 3.7 million from 3 million, the volunteer force to
219,000 from about 100,000, and federal financing to $13.2 million
from $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richardson was born Anne Francis Hazard on Dec. 5, 1929, in
Providence, R.I., the fourth of five children of a Rhode Island
state senator. She graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe and
later served on the Harvard University board of overseers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband and her son Henry, who lives in
Washington, she is survived by two other children, Nancy Carlson of
St. George, Vt., and Michael Richardson of Upper Montclair, N.J.; a
sister, Mary Conrad of Albuquerque, N.M.; two brothers, T.P. Hazard
Jr. of Rockville, Md., and Oliver C. Hazard of Bedford, N.Y., and

   Constance Friess Holman, the first woman to become chief
resident in medicine at New York Hospital, died last Friday at
Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Brattleboro, Vt. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, her daughter, Jane Clough, said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being first in her class at Cornell Medical School, she
got the residency at what is now the New York Weill Cornell Center
of Presbyterian Hospital only because the man originally chosen had
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   While studying at Barnard College, she tutored and cared for the
grandchildren of Adolph S. Ochs, then the publisher of The New York

arranged to have the debt forgiven upon his death.
</P>
<P>
   She retired in 1988 after a long career practicing internal
medicine in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   She was divorced from her first husband, William Alexander
Cooper, in 1969. Her second husband, Cranston W. Holman, died in
1993.

LOS ANGELES PROVIDES NFL `FRAMEWORK' FOR AGREEMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN McCLAIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEMONT, Ill. _ As expected, Los Angeles presented the NFL with
a nonbinding, exclusive negotiating agreement Wednesday that allows
the city to move forward with its attempt to keep the expansion
franchise it was conditionally awarded over Houston in March.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League did not sign off on the agreement,
which shows Los Angeles' stadium design and location but doesn't
address financing.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue called it a ``framework to move
forward'' toward the Sept. 15 deadline Los Angeles has for
presenting a solid stadium financing plan for the New Coliseum at
Exposition Park. If Los Angeles can't make the deadline, it risks
losing the team to Houston and prospective owner Robert McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was re-emphasized that Sept. 15 is a fair and firm date,
and we need to stick to that date,'' Tagliabue said. ``We're still
not there. We need to keep working to see how it can get done. This
document is just the framework. I don't see any need to execute it
now. There are some things we're in agreement with, and there are
some things we aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair didn't attend the meeting but said from Houston,
``They're being very positive, but once again, they haven't
answered the key question of how they're going to come up with a
financing plan for the stadium to make sure they have a successful
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they put a financing deal on the table showing public
contribution, I feel good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chadwick, appointed by California Gov. Gray Davis to
represent the state interests, made a presentation with the two
ownership groups of Michael Ovitz and Eli Broad/Ed Roski. Their
presentation showed the new stadium design and the location for the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the owners) didn't exactly bring down the house with
applause,'' Chadwick said after the presentation at the O'Hare
Hyatt. ``There are legitimate economic concerns, and our primary
focus has to be on financing the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Both groups said they are planning a 2003 start-up season, not
2002 like the NFL wants. Both groups said they don't want to play
in an existing stadium such as the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has no problem playing the 2002 season in the Astrodome
if he gets the team and his new stadium can't be completed on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to, we will,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Los Angeles ownership groups said they have been slowed
because the league has yet to determine the expansion fee. The fee,
likely to be at least $500 million, could be determined by Sept.
15.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the league could accept offers (bid by the two
groups), and if they aren't high enough, the league might establish
the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been accomplished in the past month is to provide a
structure for continuing negotiations to get it done,'' Tagliabue
said. ``We're encouraged by the site development and stadium plan.
The (expansion) committee co-chairs (Carolina Panthers owner Jerry
Richardson and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft) will write
a letter recommending league support for the New Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   League support would come in the form of a $150 million loan,
the payback of which is guaranteed by the sale of club suite
premiums. That type of loan would also be available to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the owners agreed that Los Angeles has made progress,
but it still pales in comparison to what Houston has on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of work to do by Sept. 15,'' Kraft said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Denver owner Pat Bowlen: ``I'm encouraged. They've got a
good opportunity to get things done by Sept. 15.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge issue has been a lack of parking on the New Coliseum
site. Chadwick presented a plan for 20,400 structured parking spots
at Exposition Park and hopes bonds can be issued to pay for the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our estimates are $425 million on the low end for the stadium
and about $150 million for parking (including $115.5 million for a
10,500-space primary parking garage),'' Chadwick said. ``But one
thing I've found is that construction budgets are usually on the
low side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner said today that it could come in between $350
million and $600 million. That's quite a range. Add the franchise
fee, and we're talking about a billion-dollar project. Everyone
will continue to work as hard as we can to get as much done by the
deadline, but I don't think we'll have everything done by then. I
think we'll be close.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz pointed out that Los Angeles is desperate for financial
help because of the magnitude of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult deal to make,'' he said. ``The main issue is
how we're going to finance the entire project. The NFL and the
state have to help us. The deadline's a concern, but the reality is
that we've met every deadline so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's room for Houston. There are a lot of people who want
to move. Houston's got a good deal. We were hoping Bob McNair would
be here today so we could ask him to loan us some money for the
L.A. project.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis insists he still owns
the rights to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about their presentation _ I'm just
concerned that we get paid,'' Davis said. ``L.A. hasn't done
anything in the five years since we left. If they (the owners) kill
the deal, I've got a state-of-the-art deal at Hollywood Park.''

ACTRESS MADE HISTORY AS FEMALE REFEREE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gwen Adair, playing the part of a nurse, had roles in 18
episodes of the hit TV show MASH. The Los Angeles woman played a
barmaid in three episodes of Starsky &AMP; Hutch and also had a part in
the movie ``Soylent Green.''
</P>
<P>
   As a small-time actress, her resume reads well.
</P>
<P>
   None of it, however, can compare to the rush Adair got when she
became the first female referee to work a major world championship
fight.
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, 1998, Adair was referee for the IBF junior
middleweight title bout between Yory Boy Campas and Pedro Ortega in
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   For the history-making feat, Adair was honored by the World
Boxing Hall of Fame last October. Friday in Hollywood, Adair will
be honored by the Golden State Boxing Association in a ceremony
entitled ``Women in Boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Five other women will also be honored, but Adair's
accomplishments are easily the most noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are other females who judge bouts, you might be
able to count on one hand the number who actually referee
professional fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never even seen another woman referee,'' said Don
Fraser of the Golden State Boxing Association.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: No other female has refereed a world title
bout. For this, Adair can thank hard work and determination. She
was passed over three other times for title bouts, but she did not
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was for things that were ludicrous, like I didn't have
enough experience,'' said Adair, who has been a California state
referee for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, she was passed over because of her gender. But
nobody is going to admit to that.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Adair got what she deserved -- but only after she had
threatened the state athletic commission with a lawsuit. She agreed
to withdraw it, provided the commission recommended her the next
time the IBF called.
</P>
<P>
   (Adair signed with the IBF five years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Adair says she will never forget her experience in Tijuana. Most
of it was good. Some of it was stressful. Like when a guy Adair
said was a member of the commission in Mexico started to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the weigh-in and this guy says, `What is this? A
woman?' '' Adair said. ``And I was thinking, `Don't tell me they're
going to mess with me at the last minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. The fight was on. History was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Referee) Bob Byrd said, `You know, you are making history
here. You are the first woman in the world to do a major title
fight,' '' Adair said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Mexican people treated Adair like royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous, but people were all over me afterward,
congratulating me, asking me for my autograph,'' she said. ``It
meant they had accepted me, that I did a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were rewarding me by letting me know they appreciated me.
I was ready to move to Mexico. Take me back to Tijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't easy for Adair. She endured all the
resistance a female venturing into male territory usually faces.
</P>
<P>
   She started off going to the Olympic Auditorium with her mother,
and then her husband, in the 1970s. Adair eventually managed one
fighter for 15 bouts. But after he went back to karate, Adair had
no fighter. So she decided she wanted to become a referee.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame referee Dick Young is 84 and the oldest active
referee in the world. Young was one of the first to gripe about
Adair becoming a referee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest,'' Young said this week, ``when I first heard
that they had licensed a woman referee, I said, `Oh, my God. Women,
they belong at home, barefoot and pregnant.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Gwen has made me swallow those words. And I'm happy she did. I
think she is outstanding, I truly do. Being a female, there is the
physical end of it. She doesn't have the strength of a man to break
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she moves good. She has good control of her fighters. I
think she has developed into a standout referee.''

CON ED DATA SHOW WEAK FEEDER CABLES IN UPPER MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The power distribution cables in upper Manhattan were
among the most trouble-plagued in Consolidated Edison's system for
years before seven of them failed on July 6, plunging the
neighborhood of Washington Heights into the city's worst blackout
in 22 years, company documents show.
</P>
<P>
   While they have not finished investigating the cause, Con Edison
officials have described the sequence of events that left 200,000
people north of 155th Street without power for 18 hours as a
random, highly unusual occurrence. They said it could have happened
anywhere in a system straining under record demand, with the city
simmering through its second consecutive 101-degree day, the
hottest in four years.
</P>
<P>
   But annual reports filed by the utility with state regulators
show that the feeder cables in Manhattan north of 110th Street have
failed more often than those in any other part of the borough, and
are among the likeliest anywhere in the city to fail. An analysis
of those documents shows that during the last five years, the
feeders supplying Washington Heights and Harlem have shut down at a
rate 80 percent higher than those for the rest of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Since the blackout, elected officials and others have wondered
aloud whether Con Edison had neglected an area populated largely by
low-income Hispanic and black people. The utility has denied the
charge. But Con Edison's own data appear to show disparities in the
resiliency of the system from one neighborhood to another,
disparities the company says it cannot explain.
</P>
<P>
   Most feeder failures do not lead to blackouts, but simply strain
the system. But if a series of feeders fail, as they did on July 6,
it can lead to a widespread loss of power.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison asserts that the best measure of performance is not
feeder failures but power failures, for which its record is
unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of last year, we had only 125 people out of service in all
of Washington Heights,'' said Robert W. Donohue, the vice president
who oversees the distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite the blackout of July 6 and 7, Con Edison, which
serves more than 3 million homes and businesses in New York City
and Westchester County, is by far the most reliable electric
utility in the United States, national data show.
</P>
<P>
   But because power failures are so rare in the city, and because
most affect a small number of customers, it is hard to draw any
conclusions from year to year, and to make
neighborhood-to-neighborhood comparisons. Feeder failures, on the
other hand, are a daily occurrence with wider implications, and
state regulators track them carefully as a crucial barometer.
Because of redundancies built into the system, most feeder failures
do not halt service, but they are a contributing factor to almost
every large blackout, Con Ed's documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Feeder cables, which do the bulk of the work to carry power, can
fail for various reasons, from excessive demand to corrosion caused
by road salt.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison's record on power failures results largely from two
factors that set it apart from other utilities. First, in
Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, nearly all of the system
is underground, impervious to ice storms, falling limbs, crashing
cars and unlucky squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   Second, in those four boroughs, most of the customers are linked
in networks. Each network has from eight to 24 feeder cables,
usually capable of carrying 13,000 volts each, and each feeder is a
backup for the others. That way, one, two or even three feeders in
a network can shut down without a loss of power.

   PRIDDIS, Alberta _ At the three most recent LPGA major
championships, players bombarded the courses with birdies. Dottie
Pepper shot 19-under-par to win the Nabisco Dinah Shore. Juli
Inkster shot 16-under-par to win both the U.S. Women's Open and the
LPG A McDonald's Championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the year's final major will be far more demanding. The du
Maurier Classic, which begins Thursday at Priddis Greens Golf and
Country Club on the outskirts of Calgary, will play the way a major
championship is expected to. The rough is thick, the greens are
firm and undulating, and the wind could be tricky. And while the
players expected a difficult test, few of them were complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably going to be the toughest major we've played all
year,'' said Karrie Webb, the LPGA money leader, who has won five
times this year, but who is still looking for her first major
championship. ``I'm excited. It's a major, you're supposed to hit
good shots. That's how it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the focus will be on Inkster, who could become the
second woman to win three of the four modern majors in one year,
joining Pat Bradley, who did it in 1986. And a victory would also
put Inkster into the LPGA Hall of Fame, based on the new points
criteria established earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Players must accumulate 27 career points to make the Hall of
Fame, with two points awarded for winning a major championship, one
point for winning any other LPGA event and one point for winning
the Vare trophy for lowest scoring average or the Rolex player of
the year award.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster has 26 career points from 21 victories, five of them
major championships _ including the du Maurier as a rookie in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I keep playing the way I have been, I'll have a chance to
win Sunday,'' said Inkster, who spent Wednesday morning intently
working with her coach, Mike McGetrick. ``But I'm not going to get
caught looking ahead. The Hall of Fame puts a lot of emphasis and
pressure on winning that last tournament to get in. I'm not going
to get caught up in that. It's difficult to win every week. There
are too many good players out here.''
</P>
<P>
   One player Inkster will not have to worry about this week is
Annika Sorenstam, who withdrew, saying she needed a rest. Sorenstam
played in Japan last week, and she has played seven of the last
eight weeks. Nevertheless, some players were surprised that
Sorenstam, the LPGA's leading money winner the last two years,
elected to skip a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand that,'' said Inkster, referring to
Sorenstam's absence. ``You only get four shots at majors. I never
would have taken off.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez, who is recovering from knee surgery, and the
defending champion Brandie Burton, who had recent shoulder surgery,
will also not play this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the du Maurier's future after next year is in doubt.
Legislation will go into effect in Canada by 2003 prohibiting
tobacco companies from sponsoring sports events. Imperial Tobacco
sponsors the du Maurier, but that relationship is expected to end
after next year's event in Ottawa. Ty Votaw, the LPGA commissioner,
is still hopeful a solution can be reached that will keep the du
Maurier as the fourth women's major, but he could offer no
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're set through next year, and beyond that, it wouldn't be
fair to speculate,'' Votaw said. ``But the du Maurier has always
been a first-class event and it continues to be. We've enjoyed a
great relationship. It has been great for us, the Canadian fans,
and Canadian golf.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the fan favorites this week will be Lorie Kane, born in
Prince Edward Island, who has become the best Canadian player on
tour. Kane is third on this year's money list behind Webb and
Inkster, yet nobody on tour has had more heartbreaking finishes
than Kane.
</P>
<P>
   She has placed second eight times in her career, including two
weeks ago at the Japan Airlines Big Apple Classic, when she lost a
five-hole sudden-death playoff to Sherri Steinhauer. The du Maurier
would be a great place for Kane to break through, and she is taking
a businesslike approach, asking her mother, Marilyn, to stay home
this weekend instead of watching the tournament in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I play for my family and fans, you have to be a bit
selfish,'' Kane said. ``My family wanted to be here, but I asked
that they stay home. This is the first du Maurier my mom has
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kane wins, her mother will certainly understand. But don't
expect to see Kane, or her peers, make quite as many birdies as
they have at this year's other majors. ``It will be a good test of
golf,'' Inkster said. ``Sixteen-under par won't win this.''

 &HT;    Braves take it on the Chen
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wednesday night was hardly the time for some more
learning on the job _ the only kind way the Atlanta Braves could
interpret their 10-4 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a National League pennant race growing hotter by
the minute, the Braves got a douse of cool reality when they turned
to rookie Bruce Chen again for a much-needed win.
</P>
<P>
   What they got was more of what Chen had been doing in his first
four major-league starts before last Friday _ tooling around. He
surrendered four runs before he'd recorded three outs as the Braves
got Russ Springer up in the bullpen in the first inning. Chen
managed to get out of the first inning, but the Braves never got
over it.
</P>
<P>
   After riding dominating pitching for three consecutive wins from
Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux and Kevin Millwood to keep the Mets at
arm's length, the Braves had to settle for much less. As a result,
their NL East lead is back down to a half-game, which is where it
will stay until Friday when the Phillies come to town for three
games.
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves thought the pressure was on by having the Mets win
9-2 on Wednesday afternoon, they were in for plenty more by the
time the Brewers got through with Chen in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Using a Mark Loretta single and a perfect Jeff Cirillo bunt down
the third-base line for a single, the inning started innocently
enough for Milwaukee. But a walk to Alex Ochoa gave Chen a
bases-loaded predicament for the fourth time in his six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Twice he'd given up grand slams. Once he'd escaped unhurt, in
Milwaukee, in fact. This time he looked like he had another way
out, but Marquis Grissom singled just inches out of Bret Boone's
reach at second to score one run. Geoff Jenkins chipped in another
with a groundout. Then Jose Valentin slammed a double to left field
to drive in two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   All four of the runs were scored on two-strike pitches from
Chen, who's still searching for ways to close the door on
big-league hitters. He lasted another 3 1/3 innings and another two
runs before exiting with his second loss.
</P>
<P>
   Chen had the perfect opportunity to prove he deserved the
fifth-starter job. But now the reality that Odalis Perez is lost
for the season with a blown elbow looks that much more daunting.

BOEING CAN'T AFFORD TO GUARANTEE JOBS, MANAGERS TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. can't afford to guarantee job levels or promise
to stop searching for firms to help it build airplanes as part of
any new contract with its Machinists, Jerry Calhoun, Boeing's top
labor negotiator, told managers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Boeing and the International Association of
Machinists sat down to craft a new contract for roughly 49,000
workers. At the heart of the negotiations is the security of jobs
at the world's largest airplane manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The company is striving to become a leaner corporation, while
union members are struggling with layoffs and outside companies
that consume a portion of the company's work and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, in an e-mail to Boeing managers obtained by the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, argued that guaranteeing job levels at Boeing
won't solve either side's problems because it threatens the
company's existence. Preserving and enhancing Boeing's ability to
compete in the airplane business is the best way to protect jobs,
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the highly cyclical aerospace industry, across-the-board
guaranteed employment levels are a prescription for disaster,''
Calhoun wrote. ``In those cases where more efficient operations are
available outside the company, it is only prudent that we explore
that option.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said they're aware the cycles of the aerospace
industry can lead to layoffs. However, they are calling on the
company to limit the use of outside firms and to provide other
assurances about future employment at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't address job security in a manner that is
satisfactory for the members, they are going to have a problem,''
said Bill Johnson, the head of the IAM's District Lodge 751.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of job security looms as perhaps the most explosive
item in the sensitive negotiations. Johnson suggested that
Machinists could walk off the job if the issue isn't addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are fired up,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, on the other hand, is striving to balance these demands
with calls from investors to create a more efficient and
competitive multinational company.
</P>
<P>
   ``To succeed we must conduct our operations in the most
efficient, cost-effective manner possible,'' Calhoun wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts say Boeing should maintain some control over
how work is assigned inside and outside the company as part of
Boeing's effort to improve its financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some flexibility where Boeing can still make
key strategic decisions about what business they want to be in or
not be in,'' said Byron Callan, an analyst who tracks Boeing for
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the restructuring effort, Calhoun repeated the
company's proposal to stretch the work week to seven days and 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many versions of this that can yield very productive
outcomes,'' Calhoun wrote in the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The union, however, has already rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way seven days,'' said Dick Schneider, a lead negotiator in
the talks for Boeing, repeating a slogan that members have
expressed in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, however, expressed interest in working on two areas
important to union members: altering language on hiring
subcontractors and returning some outsourced work to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists union wants to strengthen language from the 1995
contract that requires the company to notify the union of
``significant'' outsourcing to allow the union to offer other
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to working with the union to explore options
to improve the process,'' Calhoun wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are still at an early stage and they won't
reach a critical point until the two camps move to a hotel on Aug.
15 for intensive negotiations. Negotiators from both sides stressed
that they are still working on the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The union members are expected to vote on whether to accept or
reject a proposed renewal of their contract, which expires on Sept.
2, on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The union has struck during two of the past three contract talks
and IAM's Schneider said they could walk out again if the company
doesn't address their concerns over job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't have teeth ... we are going to stand before our
members and recommend they shut this company down,'' Schneider
said.

COMPAQ MAY LAY OFF 8,000 AFTER BEING HIT BY $184 MILLION LOSS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Battered by weak sales, rising expenses and falling
prices for its products, Compaq Computer Corp. lost big money in
the second quarter and its new chief executive warned that as many
as 8,000 workers will lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many workers at Compaq's Houston headquarters will
be laid off is not yet known. In a conference call with reporters
Wednesday, Michael Capellas, Compaq's new chief executive, said the
details are still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Between 6,000 and 8,000 employees will get pink slips as part of
a restructuring that also will have Compaq closing some facilities
and taking a $700 million to $900 million charge in the current
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will attack operating expenses aggressively throughout the
year, and we will get to a more competitive level,'' Capellas said.
``Our goal is to eliminate $2 billion in annual costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The $184 million second-quarter loss, equal to 10 cents a share,
comes on sales of $9.4 billion, up 17 percent over the same period
in 1998. In June, the company warned of a quarterly loss of as much
as 16 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons with last year's numbers are on a pro-forma
basis, as though Compaq and Digital were one entity throughout the
second quarter. The acquisition of Digital closed in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has about 69,000 employees worldwide _ about 12,000 are
in Houston _ so an 8,000-person layoff would reduce the company's
work force by 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When Compaq acquired Digital, the company vowed to lay off
17,000 _ 15,000 from the Digital ranks and 2,000 from Compaq's.
</P>
<P>
   Capellas said another 2,000 employees remained to be cut as a
direct result of the Digital deal, and the 6,000-to-8,000 are on
top of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be exact, we've reduced by 15,250 since then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Kumar, an analyst with US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said the
new layoffs could be heavy in Compaq's sales and marketing areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still plenty of overlap there between Digital and
Compaq,'' Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Compaq already has lost a lot of good employees as
the company's fortunes have tumbled and morale dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be careful about cutting the wheat instead of the
chaff _ there's not a lot of chaff left,'' Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's performance was actually better than analysts had
expected. The consensus of analysts' estimate gathered by First
Call had Compaq taking an 11-cent-a-share loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter last year, Compaq had sales of $8.02
billion and a loss of $3.63 billion _ or $2.33 cents a share _ as
the result of the Digital purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Capellas cited several reasons for Compaq's poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   He said Compaq was hurt by vicious price competition in its core
business _ personal computers sold to corporations. Lower prices in
this sector resulted in profits being squeezed. Compaq's
second-quarter gross margin _ the percentage difference when
expenses are subtracted from sales _ was just 20.5 percent,
compared to 24.7 in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that operating expenses jumped to $2.2 billion from
$1.9 billion in the first quarter. Those expenses were
wide-ranging, including completion of year 2000 readiness projects
to amortization related to the sale of AltaVista to increased
spending for promotion and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Ross, an analyst in San Francisco with ABN Amro, said
Compaq's complaints about pricing pressures continue to be an
anomaly in the industry. While its competitors face the same
downward trend in pricing, they have not felt it at the bottom line
in the same way as Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ultimately points to their own inefficiency, and they've
been hurt by it,'' Ross said. ``Their competitors can take the
pressure better than Compaq can.''
</P>
<P>
   The inventory that Compaq keeps in its dealer channel _ the
middlemen who sell Compaq systems to businesses _ actually shrank a
bit compared to the first quarter of the year, to 3.5 weeks as
compared with 3.9 weeks. Analysts had been worried that Compaq
products were beginning to pile up on its dealers' shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq reported its earnings after markets closed Wednesday. The
company's stock closed at 26, up 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   The company did have some good news to report in its consumer
sales. Compaq said it hit an all-time high for monthly shipments in
June, and that it had year-over-year unit growth of 63 percent and
revenue growth of 35 percent in that market.
</P>
<P>
   But the consumer segment is also the one with the thinnest
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar said Compaq could begin seeing the light at the end of the
tunnel in the fourth quarter, as the changes it is making now begin
to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Capellas said improvements in Compaq's financial situation could
begin to surface as early as this quarter. First Call analysts
estimate Compaq will post a 5-cent-a-share profit for the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been struggling with industry-wide changes. The
cutthroat pricing that had been unique to the consumer business has
made its way into the traditionally more profitable commercial
side.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Compaq's business customers are increasingly turning to
computer makers who sell directly to them, rather than going
through resellers, who add costs. Chief among the direct vendors is
Round Rock-based Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Recent market share figures from International Data Corp, a
research firm, show that Dell has almost caught Compaq as the top
PC maker in the U.S. market. Analysts say Dell could surpass Compaq
domestically this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   However, Compaq maintains a solid lead over Dell worldwide,
though Dell's global growth is greater than that of Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been rocked by these changes since the first quarter
of 1998, and the company's rocky performance is one of the factors
that cost previous Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer and Chief
Financial Officer Earl Mason their jobs in April.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Wednesday was the first public outing for
Capellas as chief executive, who was promoted late last week from
his job as interim chief operating officer. Capellas came to Compaq
last August as its new chief information officer.
</P>
<P>
   After Pfeiffer was ousted, Compaq was run by a three-man
``office of the chief executive'' headed up by board Chairman
Benjamin Rosen. After Capellas was named president and chief
executive, Rosen dissolved both the office of the chief executive
as well as the chief operating officer's post.

GORE COURTS HISPANIC VOTE IN SWING THROUGH HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LORI RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Weaving Spanish words through his English and against
the lilt of mariachi music, Vice President Al Gore campaigned
Wednesday in the heart of Houston's Hispanic east side and left his
Latino listeners pleased but wincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soy abuelito'' (I'm a grandfather), the Democratic
presidential front-runner told receptive Latinos gathered in the
gymnasium of a new educational center for the George I. Sanchez
Charter High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandson Wyatt was born on the Fourth of July, clearly a
precocious child. Perhaps my next grandson will be born on Cinco de
Mayo.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes and halting Spanish aside, the point of the Gore trip to
the center, a 15-year-old dream of the venerable Association for
the Advancement of Mexican Americans, was politics in the home
state of the Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There and in a later speech to the annual meeting of the
National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic advocacy
group, Gore scored major points merely by showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is vacationing at his family's home in Kennebunkport,
Maine. His aides said he could not fit the Hispanic meetings into
his schedule, but he has courted the Hispanic vote at many stops
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They underestimated the reaction of our community,'' La Raza
President Raul Yzaguirre said of the rejected invitation by the
Bush campaign. ``People were angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzaguirre said Bush's absence fueled politically damaging
speculation that he was either taking his Latino support for
granted or distancing himself to keep peace with the Republican
right-wing that spawned former California Gov. Pete Wilson and his
anti-immigrant initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   A warmer, fuzzier Gore with a noticeably improved Spanish accent
hammered home a long list of accomplishments on issues critical to
the nation's fastest growing minority, including health care,
education and immigration. Gore was accompanied during his visit by
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, the highest-ranking Latino in the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not satisfied when even one Latino is left out of our
prosperity,'' said Gore, adding a refrain he used in both
appearances: ``Nuestras familias merecen lo mejor'' (Our families
deserve the best).
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certainly not satisfied when 10 percent of all of the
uninsured children in the United States live right here in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore never mentioned Bush by name, he repeatedly attacked
the Republican leadership for a tax-cut plan he said would
jeopardize Social Security, Medicare and other social services on
which many needy, elderly and disabled Latinos depend. Bush has
said he would sign the Republican tax cut plan now pending in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Texas, the state with the second highest percentage of
uninsured children in America, we need to question how any leader
could support such a risky scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked afterward whether his pointed remarks referred to his
Republican rival, Gore said, ``I didn't use that name but, if the
shoe fits, wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's snub of La Raza spawned a flurry of ``Where's George?''
lapel stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee piled on Bush in conjunction
with Gore's trip, noting his decisions to skip not only the La Raza
convention but also the meetings of the League of United Latin
American Citizens in Corpus Christi and of the National Association
of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Philadelphia. Bush has
agreed to address the meeting of the National Urban League, a black
civil rights group, next month in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's long and enthusiastically received speech to the more
than 2,000 La Raza conferees was his third appearance before a
major Latino group this month. On July 7, he swung by Philadelphia
to the NALEO meeting, and on July 17 he went to Long Beach, Calif.,
for the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project
conference.
</P>
<P>
   He also met with a group of Latino leaders at the White House
and with members of the Hispanic Congressional Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt threatened by Bush, who captured about 40
percent of the Texas Latino vote in his 1998 gubernatorial
re-election, Gore said that Latino concerns have always been a
priority for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a new pattern for me and it doesn't come as a
response to any developments on the other side,'' Gore said. ``I
have been reaching out in exactly this way the entire time I've
been vice president. These events have always been on my
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the increased and improving Spanish, Gore said, in
Spanish, that he likes to practice his Spanish and welcomed every
opportunity to refresh his skills. ``It's like living la vida loca.
It just grabs a hold of me.''
</P>
<P>
   So, apparently, does campaigning among the nation's 31 million
Latinos, who are concentrated in the key electoral states of Texas,
California, New York, Florida and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   At the east-side gymnasium, still smelling of fresh paint, Gore
began by shaking hands with the mariachis and ended by plunging
into the audience. At La Raza, after giving his Spanish a thorough
workout, he startled several dozen mainly Latino servers in a
curtained-off preparation area when he stopped to collect more
handshakes, hugs and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He connected with the audience very well,'' said Yzaguirre,
who on Wednesday closed the conference of La Raza's 240 community
groups from across the country. ``He reached our hearts and he
reached our minds.''

EMBASSY'S FORMER VISE SECTION CHIEF UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 Republic Washington Bureau  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House committee today will unveil evidence of new
favors, including a free stay at a luxury Scottsdale suite,
provided to a former visa official at the U.S. embassy in Beijing
by a Chinese government-owned conglomerate or its Valley-based
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Charles M. Parish Jr., the embassy's former visa section chief,
accepted a number of previously undisclosed gifts from Elizabeth
Mann, operator of a Phoenix real-estate company called BNU Corp.
that is owned by the conglomerate, according to House Government
Reform Committee investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is holding a hearing today with Parish expected to
be the lead witness.
</P>
<P>
   `` The Arizona Republic'' reported in March that Parish, in
violation of State Department rules, accepted free lodging at
corporate apartments in Las Vegas and Norwalk, Calif., in 1995 and
1996 from China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and
Export Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The committee says Parish, who has denied any quid pro quo
relationship, was providing visa assistance at the request of Mann
and others so that officials of the conglomerate, known as COFCO,
could travel frequently to Phoenix and other U.S. destinations.
State Department rules forbid embassy officials from accepting
gifts from anyone seeking visas or other official action.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Republic'' has learned that the committee plans today to
release new evidence that deepens the Parish-Mann relationship that
has piqued the interest of committee investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Mann was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached for
comment, according to her firm. Parish was also unavailable pending
today's hearing in which he will testify publicly for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic has learned that the new information includes:
</P>
<P>
   _Mann gave Parish ``a number of gifts,'' a former COFCO vice
president, Jay Ding, has told the committee staff. Ding has told
the panel's investigators he saw Mann pass several wrapped boxes
and an envelope to Parish while he was dining with COFCO and BNU
officials in Beijing and Phoenix. Ding told the committee he didn't
know what the gifts were. He said Mann mentioned a gold Rolex watch
and $2,000 in casino chips in connection with Parish, but Ding is
not sure she gave either to Parish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _The committee said Parish stayed free of charge at a COFCO
luxury suite
 &UR; in Scottsdale. The address could not be obtained from either the
committee or
 &UR; Mann's office.
</P>
<P>
   _Several e-mails in Parish's office suggest that Parish, at
Mann's request, helped Fuli Lin, the vice chairman of BNU, to
obtain a visa, according to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mann has not been summoned as a witness by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pursuing a number of issues involving Elizabeth Mann,''
said Mark Corallo, the committee spokesman. ``We intend to contact
her soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish told the ``Republic'' in March that his activities may
have raised questions, but he denied impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I ever abuse my position? No,'' Parish said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's hearing will focus not only on alleged improper action
by Parish, but on Burton's claim that others in the embassy seemed
to overlook any problems and the State Department has not
aggressively been investigating. Among those on the witness list is
Jacquelyn Williams-Bridgers, the State Department's inspector
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. embassy in Beijing is one of our most sensitive
diplomatic posts in the world,'' Burton said in a prepared
statement. ``It is unfathomable that these kinds of activities
could go on right under the noses of top embassy officials for a
year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's committee is the same one that has been looking into
whether Chinese government money was used to influence the 1996
U.S. elections.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also led an investigation several years ago into
whether Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a former Arizona
governor, allowed politics to influence his department in the
rejection of an Indian casino application. The matter ended up in
an independent counsel investigation.

WHAT SHOWDOWN NEEDS IS TRASH TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The $1.5 million ``Showdown at Sherwood'' between
titanium-toting blasters Tiger Woods and David Duval will establish
diddly, except who happens to be the planet's best player on this
given Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   And who had the most profitable outing at Sherwood Country Club,
one of the nation's toniest golf establishments, as the winner
leaves town with $1.1 million in unofficial but extremely spendable
cash. The loser pockets $400,000, which is not a bad wage for a few
hours work. Each player will contribute $200,000 to charity.
</P>
<P>
   While match play _ where there can be a loser on every hole _ is
golf's version of sudden death, we'll have to wait until season's
end to find out which one stands atop the heap this year.
</P>
<P>
   This event won't have any trouble living up to the hype because
there really hasn't been any.
</P>
<P>
   Historically speaking, Billie Jean King's beating the pants off
Bobby Riggs will probably prove to be better prime-time theater. So
will ``Sports Night'' and ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragging rights are not even at stake, because both golfers have
downplayed any rivalry. Woods might do a little fist-pumping after
sinking a putt and Duval might actually blink behind those
wrap-around shades, but it's doubtful that the victor will do any
chest-thumping.
</P>
<P>
   About the closest thing this sport has ever had to an outrageous
statement was uttered by television yakker Curtis Strange, an
announcer at Monday's event, who after winning his second U.S. Open
in a row promptly said: ``Move over, Ben.'' He referred, of course,
to the legendary Ben Hogan, the last golfer to pull off the repeat.
</P>
<P>
   After Strange removed his Foot-Joy from his mouth, his game got
a dose of the big chill and he soon found himself behind a
microphone explaining how other players managed to shank a two-foot
putt or spray shots.
</P>
<P>
   Strange himself seems to long for a little edge to Monday
night's event. It would give ABC's promotion department something
to promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If either player came out and said, `I want to beat his butt'
that would be something everybody would embrace and have fun with,
but that's not going to happen,'' he said during a conference call
with network producers and his announcing partner, Mike Tirico.
</P>
<P>
   This is an event that just about everybody has played down, not
up.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the rivalry between Woods, the current world No. 1
player, and Duval, the No. 2, who used to be No. 1. The showdown
will have no impact on these standings.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, including the brass at ABC, deny a rivalry even
exists since Woods and Duval have not declared war on each other.
</P>
<P>
   Strange has a strange take on this situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for rivalry, I don't think there is a big one yet because
we haven't seen it in a tournament. Until that happens, in either
tournament play or major championships, their true rivalry won't
happen. But they are both very young still. They are the future of
golf. I think the rivalry will happen eventually,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is rife with rivalries, albeit some of them friendly. You
think 150 guys tee it up each week to finish 35th?
</P>
<P>
   So what do you suppose Woods and Duval will be thinking when
they step up to the first tee Monday? They will both be trying to
grind the other into dust and win by the biggest margin possible.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not too late to spice things up. Strange, while
pointing out that both are great players, believes Woods will be
the man Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to pick one over the other is like throwing dice. At
the current stage of both games, I think you have to pick Tiger as
a slight favorite because he is playing so well right now. During
the course of a year, players have ups and downs, and David is
going through a bit of a down right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Add showdown: The management at Sherwood Country Club reportedly
set the high ticket prices, which were originally $550 for a
clubhouse pass and $225 for a grounds pass. Sherwood officials
declined comment on the pricing policy. Spokesman Steve Brener said
that price of a grounds pass has been lowered to $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we wanted to give more people an opportunity to
attend,'' he said. The gallery is expected to be between 1,000 and
2,000 spectators. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Play will start on the 9th hole, the more mountainous section of
the course, to give Woods and Duval a better chance of finishing
while the sun is still shining.
</P>
<P>
   They will tee off at 4:30 p.m. and the telecast will start at 5
p.m., when the players are expected to be on their third hole. &QL;

 UNHOLY MATRIMONY- Wedding jitters put brides, bridegrooms to test (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The invitations are sealed, stamped, sent.
</P>
<P>
   Gift-bearing, pastel-wearing guests are filling the church.
</P>
<P>
   The organist's hands are poised just above the keys, and then
this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't marry you.''
</P>
<P>
   To quote the mantra of the jilted, a line from ``The Wedding
Singer'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think that information would have been more useful
to me yesterday?''
</P>
<P>
   They're cases of frozen feet, these would-be weddings, stories
that lurk deep in the nightmares of brides-to-be and dance through
the dreams of diffident bridegrooms.
</P>
<P>
   They're dollars in psychologists' pockets, champagne gone flat
and prime Hollywood fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts, for example, takes the screen Friday in ``Runaway
Bride,'' an interesting case of art imitating life. Roberts ditched
beau Kiefer Sutherland just days before their wedding a few years
back. (We feel for her: Must be tough to love a guy named Kiefer.)
</P>
<P>
   But these stories are also true, and, thus, in a case of art
imitating art imitating life (if you can call this art), we offer
you the tales of real runaway brides and bridegrooms, coupled with
the wisdom of a psychologist who has defrosted those frigid feet.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Reilley and Kirstin Swanson had it going on: a 10-year
friendship both valued, a Hawaiian honeymoon planned, and a wedding
date just weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seemed to click,'' says Reilley, a journalism
instructor at Northwestern University. ``It was all falling into
place.''
</P>
<P>
   But then _ doomsday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The invitations were sent out, the church was reserved, the
condo picked out,'' says Reilley. But Swanson, who lives in Los
Angeles, wanted out _ just three weeks before the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a shock,'' says Reilley, 33, who lives in the
Chicago area. ``Like I'd been hit by a ball bat in the stomach. I
lost my best friend of 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilley says Swanson was having pain revisited: She has been
married before, it didn't pan out, and she thought this marriage
was also headed for the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   David Helgeson, a Scottsdale psychologist, says this is common
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get stuck in the past,'' he says. ``They resurrect
everything that went wrong in the past relationship, start seeing
things in the present, and sometimes they make them happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilley says he was willing to wait it out but Swanson wasn't,
and they were left to dissolve their relationship. The $6,000 they
had invested in caterers, flowers and dresses was lost. Swanson's
gown went back in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Reilley turned to friends and family, who encouraged and
supported him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stung for a long time,'' he says. But now, nearly a year
later, he is dating again _ very carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even interested in getting married right now,'' he
says. ``I'm much pickier, much more apprehensive. It's hard for me
to go on dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to invest my time in someone that I'm not really
interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's always hope.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, after the year of pain, after the money lost, if
Swanson were willing, ``I'd drop what I'm doing and marry her,''
Reilley says.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson declined to elaborate. She said that time in her life is
still a little too fresh in her mind and that she completely trusts
Reilley's version of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult time for both of us but a decision I'm glad
I made,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Helgeson says some people have a serious,
deep-seated fear of life-binding contracts that manifests itself as
wedding preparations are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (fear) happens to people who really aren't focusing on
what they're going to get out of the relationship,'' says Helgeson,
who has treated a number of runaway bridegrooms but no brides.
``Their minds start to run wild with what they're going to be
giving up instead of thinking about all the great things that it
could lead to.''
</P>
<P>
   And today's high divorce rate and nasty court battles add to
this fear, he says. Because Arizona is a no-fault state, bank
accounts and assets usually are cut right down the middle in a
split.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're afraid of financial ruin,'' Helgeson says.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the financial ruin of canceling a paid-for wedding:
Caterers and florists aren't often keen on last-minute order
sacking. Sometimes, psychologists say, people can get caught up in
the momentum of a wedding, scared silent by the sheer mass of
expenses and the sheer humiliation of backing out after
announcements have been sent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reilley says that with all the embarrassment of sending out
cancellation cards, he's glad he didn't have to go through a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause of fleet-footed brides and bridegrooms, according
to Helgeson, is a simple case of disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they wake up and they realize, `I'm not in love with
this person, I'm more in love with the idea of being in love,' ''
Helgeson says.
</P>
<P>
   That could have been one of the causes in the case of Nicole
Contos, a New York woman who made the talk-show rounds in 1997
after being dumped by her fiance, literally at the altar (a
groomsman delivered the message), and continuing with her $65,000
reception sans groom. (And at that cost, who wouldn't?)
</P>
<P>
   According to the Associated Press, she ``even danced to the
anthem of the jilted, ``I Will Survive.'''' The exact reason for
their breakup hasn't been revealed, but rumor has it that her groom
is set to write a tell-all book.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the situation or pre-wedding shivers, psychologists say
couples should communicate their hesitations to each other _
announcements, expensive rentals and painful breakups
notwithstanding. They're much more painful when marriage contracts
are involved.
</P>
<P>
   And, Helgeson advises, couples who are having doubts should see
a counselor to avoid last-minute lamentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to clarify for themselves that it is not just cold
feet and the little anxieties that everyone has,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like tripping when you finally walk down the gangplank, er,
aisle. &QL;

MILOSEVIC WILL BE ONLY BALKANS LEADER MISSING FROM SUMMIT 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the world opens its wallet to Kosovo and
considers rebuilding its Balkan neighbors, White House officials
are predicting that an international conference in Bosnia will
further isolate Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic will be the only Balkan leader excluded from the
conference, a gathering Friday to be attended by President Clinton
and top officials from 40 nations who hope to prod the war-torn
region toward economic and political reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of disaffection (in Serbia) with Slobodan
Milosevic, and I think that one of the most important elements of
Friday will be the empty chair,'' said National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia will be the only country not there, (the) only country
not part of an enterprise that means rebuilding and rebirth and
growth and better lives for the people of the region,'' Berger
said. ``Most people in Serbia today ... believe that he has led
them down a path to destruction, that he has brought them four wars
and a ruined economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic's government will not be represented, a handful
of Serb opposition leaders have been invited, a move Berger said
``certainly has our support.'' At the same time, while supporting
forces inside Yugoslavia ``who are working for democratic change,
Berger downplayed the suggestion that the U.S. or its allies are
trying to lead an insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the purpose of this meeting is to concert our
efforts with respect to change in Serbia,'' Berger said, adding
that the summit will signal that ``a new southeastern Europe is
taking shape, and the Serbian people are going to have to decide
whether they are simply going to not be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved
legislation _ supported by the White House _ designed to help drive
Milosevic from office. The bill sets aside $100 million to promote
democracy in Serbia and Montenegro, which make up the Yugoslav
republic, and to increase Voice of America broadcasts into the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the Balkans summit opens in Sarajevo, the
capital of Bosnia, leaders from more than 60 nations met Wednesday
in Brussels and pledged about $2.1 billion to help rebuild Kosovo.
The U.S. agreed to contribute $500 million to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Of the amount pledged by the donor nations, $245 million was
promised in time to help Kosovar refugees through the winter. In
addition to food and shelter for the Kosovar Albanians driven from
their homes by Milosevic's forces, the U.S. money was earmarked for
sanitation, water supply, land mine removal and prosecuting
suspected war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kosovo's) most immediate, urgent requirements, which were the
objectives of this meeting, have been met,'' Chris Poortman, World
Bank coordinator for southeastern Europe told reporters after the
Brussels conference.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting in Brussels and Friday's summit in Sarajevo
come seven weeks after the U.S.-led air war against Yugoslavia.
Toward the end of the conflict, Milosevic was indicted by the
International War Crimes Tribunal on charges stemming from
atrocities committed by the Serb army and police against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's Balkans summit, in addition to underscoring Milosevic's
pariah status, was described by Berger and other administration
officials as a first step in a long-term effort to bring peace and
stability to southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, organized by the European Union, will not result in
additional, immediate financial commitments to aid the troubled
region, Berger said. ``Friday's summit is really to launch a
regional compact with the rest of Europe and set the direction on
democracy, on security, on economic reform that will bring this
region of the world, eventually, into the European mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Balkan countries will present ``their vision for
progress and cooperation on tasks including strengthening
democracy, civil society, ethnic and religious tolerance, economic
reform,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, scheduled to last three hours, will end with leaders
issuing a Sarajevo declaration describing the general commitments
made by participants.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's national economic adviser, said
the long-term success of rebuilding the Balkans states ``will
depend very much on the steps they take'' to reassure investors and
potential trading partners. ``Ultimately, someone still has to
believe there is a viable economic investment with a return to put
funds in there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The summit grew out of the Balkans Stability Pact, signed last
month in Cologne by the U.S., European Union, Russia, and other
industrialized nations. It will be the first meeting of leaders
from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia since they
broke from Yugoslavia at the outset of war in 1991. Other members
of the pact are Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Turkey.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in the Senate turned aside a Democratic
plan Wednesday to limit the size of their proposed tax cut, even as
centrists from both parties laid out a middle ground on which a
compromise could eventually be forged.
</P>
<P>
   But as Republicans moved closer to Senate passage of the largest
tax cut since 1981, they suffered a quirky procedural defeat that
in theory would force them to rescind their tax reductions in 10
years, just after they fully take effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of debate in the Senate on how big a tax cut
the nation can afford in an era of anticipated federal budget
surpluses, Republicans made a case for sending as much excess
revenue as possible back to taxpayers while Democrats warned that
too big a reduction would wreak havoc with the economy, favor the
wealthy and starve vital government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans and a few Democrats were pushing for
legislation that would cut taxes by $792 billion over 10 years,
using the bulk of the nearly $1 trillion in projected surpluses
over the next decade that the two parties agree are up for grabs.
The House passed a tax cut last week along party lines that is the
same size but which is made up of different provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``After paying for the government programs for which Congress
has planned and budgeted, the change must now be returned to the
taxpayer,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the chairman of the
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has threatened to veto either version, saying
both would risk a return to budget deficits and limit Washington's
ability to shore up the ailing Social Security and Medicare
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has opened the door to negotiations, and has
countered the Republican plan with an offer of a tax cut of up to
$300 billion, a figure supported by most Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not mislead the American people by promising them
massive tax cuts which may well be based only on phantom surpluses
which never materialize,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. ``Even if
the surpluses do happen, this Republican tax cut plan could
emasculate national security, public investments and the operations
of government.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of 10 centrist Democrats and Republicans sought to kick
start the process of finding a middle ground Wednesday by proposing
a $500 billion compromise plan that includes elements sought by
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Based on preliminary votes Wednesday, Republicans appeared to
have the votes they need to pass their $792 billion plan in the
Senate by the end of this week. They defeated an attempt by
Democrats to limit the tax cut to $290 billion over 10 years on a
60-39 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans suffered at least a symbolic setback when they
were unable to sidestep a rule _ written at a time when Congress
was intent on limiting the growth of budget deficits _ that makes
it difficult to pass tax cuts that remain in effect for more than
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The rule essentially bars any provisions in a tax or budget bill
that results in the government losing revenue after the first 10
years, which a net tax cut of the sort under consideration by both
parties does by definition.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans asked for a waiver of the rule, a step that
requires 60 votes. But they could muster only 51 votes, while all
45 Democrats and three moderate Republicans voted to keep the rule
in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Senate bill become law _ an unlikely prospect given
Clinton's veto threat _ it would phase in most of its tax cuts
gradually over the next decade as the projected budget surplus
increases. The cuts would then remain in effect permanently. But
under the budget rule, the entire tax cut would be rescinded after
2009.
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect would not necessarily be so dire for
Republicans, who could pass new budget rules in future sessions of
Congress or could pass legislation extending the tax cuts past
2009.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, any compromise tax proposals will
require bipartisan support to become law, and any deal between the
Republican leadership and Clinton would likely bring along enough
Democrats in the Senate to get over the 60-vote hurdle needed to
waive the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harshly partisan tone of Wednesday's debate in the
Senate, the $500 billion compromise plan advanced by five
Republicans and five Democrats suggested some willingness to reach
a deal, though probably not until after Congress finishes passing
some version of the current Republican proposals and Clinton vetoes
it.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors of the compromise measure, which is likely to be
considered by the Senate on Thursday, said their plan has almost no
chance of being adopted at this point. But they said it could be
the basis for negotiations between the White House and Congress,
probably starting in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're serious about passing a tax cut this year, I believe
this alternative is the right way to go,'' said Sen. John Chafee,
R-R.I., one of the sponsors of the $500 billion compromise. ``If we
are successful, I believe the final package will look a lot like
our bipartisan alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Republicans backing the compromise plan were Sens.
James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and Susan
Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine. The Democrats were Sens.
John Breaux and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
John Edwards of North Carolina and Evan Bayh of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 billion plan would substantially increase the standard
deduction, providing a $283 billion cut in personal income taxes
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the current $7,200 deduction for married couples
filing jointly would be increased to $11,550 and the current $4,300
standard deduction for single filers would increase to $5,600.
Since upper-income households usually itemize their deductions, the
change would primarily benefit lower- and middle-income households.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise package would also reduce the so-called marriage
penalty, which leaves many two-income couples paying more in taxes
than they would if they were single and living together. It would
include a modest reduction in capital gains taxes and in
inheritance taxes on large estates, and would provide tax breaks
for education and the purchase of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the $792 billion Senate Republican plan is a
reduction in the current 15 percent personal income tax bracket to
14 percent and an expansion of the 14 percent bracket to higher
income levels.
</P>
<P>
   The $290 billion Democratic alternative that was rejected by the
Senate on Wednesday was built around an increase in the standard
deduction for personal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans remained on the defensive Wednesday over comments
made by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Repeating a
message he first sent to Congress last week, Greenspan told the
Senate Banking Committee that Congress would be ``better off
holding off on a tax cut immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said there is no certainty that the projected
surpluses will materialize, and that the economy would benefit more
from reducing the national debt than from tax cuts. But he said he
would prefer tax cuts to using the surplus for additional
government spending.

SPURRIER MAKES PITCH FOR PLAYOFF AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Florida coach Steve Spurrier is a playoff
proponent. Southeastern Conference commissioner Roy Kramer is the
architect and director of the Bowl Championship Series, the
ratings-driven, non-playoff method by which college football is
crowning its ``mythical'' national champion.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's Southeastern Conference football media forum,
Spurrier stated his opinion again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the `commish' is back there and doesn't like to hear me
talk about playoffs,'' Spurrier said, provoking laughter and a
smile from Kramer. ``If you had 16 teams and started playing it
down, maybe a team with one or two losses would win it. That team
might be the best team at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier advocates having a football committee similar to the
basketball committee that selects and seeds the NCAA Tournament. He
said that former Texas coach Darrell Royal would be the perfect
choice as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, but that's too logical,'' Spurrier said, again provoking
chuckles. ``They don't ask my opinion. They hear it a lot, but they
don't ask for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said that for all its criticism, the BCS accomplished its
mission last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We matched the consensus one and two teams \RTennessee and
Florida State\S,'' he said. ``We maintained the bowl system. And we
heightened interest in the regular season.'' \Nsubheds:BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ While western football fans will be watching the Colorado at
Washington game on Sept. 25, pitting the Buffs against former coach
Rick Neuheisel, there's an SEC coaching grudge match on the same
date when Mississippi plays at Auburn (and former Rebels coach
Tommy Tuberville).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players were shocked when he left for Auburn,'' first-year
Ole Miss coach David Cutcliffe said. ``There will be a lot of hype
about that game and to say they won't be excited about it would be
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Good news: Vanderbilt has its top two passers, top three
rushers and top six wide receivers returning. Bad news: The
Commodores were last in the SEC in offense and scored seven or
fewer points five times last season. ``I think our offensive line
is stronger,'' Vanderbilt coach Woody Widenhofer said of his hopes
for an improved offense. ``It's the first time in my three years
here we've had depth at quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kramer is busting his buttons over the SEC's 1998 season. ``It
was unprecedented for a lot of reasons,'' he said. First, the SEC
set an NCAA record with eight bowl teams. The SEC had six of the
top 10 teams in national attendance and its 12 teams played to 99.6
percent of capacity. Kramer said one of every five fans who
attended a Division I-A game last season was at an SEC game.

STARS STRIKE DEAL WITH GUY CARBONNEAU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars' desire to get younger and quicker cost
veterans Craig Ludwig, Pat Verbeek and Dave Reid their jobs.
However, the team's oldest player remains in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Carbonneau, the Stars' 39-year-old fourth-line center and
penalty-killing specialist, agreed to a one-year contract with an
option for a second year, the team announced Wednesday. Carbonneau
will receive at least $1.32 million this season, based on a
mandatory 10 percent raise he'll receive over last season's salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be part of it for another year,'' Carbonneau
said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal means Carbonneau, who was an unrestricted free agent,
could play until he is 41 if both sides agree to pick up the second
year, but he's not looking that far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll talk about that after this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau was somewhat concerned there wouldn't be a ``this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Stars won the Stanley Cup, Carbonneau had what he
termed a ``good conversation'' with coach Ken Hitchcock and general
manager Bob Gainey and thought they wanted him back.
</P>
<P>
   Then the team started telling most of its veteran free agents to
find jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to see which way to go,'' Carbonneau said. ``We
had an older team, and they wanted to get younger.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the delay was that the Stars wanted to give
Carbonneau time to consider whether to put himself through the
grind of training camp and the regular season for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau said he briefly thought about going out on top after
winning the Stanley Cup for the third time, but then decided to
play at least one more season. When the Stars decided they wanted
him to return, the deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of happy when they called back,'' said Carbonneau,
who also played on Cup-winning teams in Montreal in 1986 and '93.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau had four goals, 12 assists and 31 penalty minutes in
74 regular-season games. He scored goals in each of the first two
playoff games against the Edmonton Oilers, and finished with six
points in 17 postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   He missed six games during the Stars' Stanley Cup run because of
a sprained medial collateral ligament and to attend the funeral of
his father at home in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau did not have the offensive numbers of fellow forwards
Verbeek and Reid, free agents who were told to seek jobs elsewhere,
but his value to the team goes beyond the stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``While his abilities on the ice are well recognized, the vast
leadership and experience that he can bring our club off the ice is
what makes his contribution so valuable,'' Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau has 250 points, 397 assists and 784 penalty minutes
in 1,249 career NHL games with the Stars, St. Louis Blues and
Montreal Canadiens since 1980. He is the only player other than
Gainey to win three Selke trophies as the NHL's top defensive
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Hogue is the Stars' only remaining unrestricted free
agent. The team's restricted free agents are Richard Matvichuk,
Manny Fernandez, Jamie Pushor, Derek Plante, Aaron Gavey and Warren
Luhning. nn

COOPER HAS SEEN THE WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Duane Cooper's playing style is defined by giving, so we've
invited him to give the sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you energy off the bench,'' he says. ``I'll give you
a leader. I'll give you someone who knows the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the former Lakewood High, USC and Laker point guard will
give you his interpretation of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Time for us to give you an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who turned 30 last month, was fielding an inquiry
concerning his capacity to make a contribution in the NBA. But
after presenting a list of standard, point-guard equipment, he
admitted his performance in the Summer Pro League hasn't inspired
much buzz among NBA talent sharpies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've done OK here,'' says Cooper, a no-nonsense point
guard who is proud to be burdened with about as much flash as a
rental car.
</P>
<P>
   In a performance comparable to that of the conductor of a garage
band, he has averaged seven assists per game for the SPL's
quixotically named NBA Pros. The Pros' lineup does include NBA
employees Cedric Ceballos and James Cotton, but - like Cooper --
the rest of his pals realize they're auditioning for paychecks in
Europe or one of the domestic minor leagues. ``It's still fun, and
I'd be playing basketball to stay in shape anyway, so I might as
well play here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper, chosen by the Lakers in the second round (the 36th
overall pick) of the 1992 NBA Draft, isn't about to dismiss the
memories of his halcyon days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I suited up with the Lakers,'' he said, ``I
looked around and there was Magic and James Worthy. That was quite
a feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   However, averaging 2.4 points and 2.3 assists in 65 games
enabled Cooper to know how it felt to catch an NBA waive. After six
days adrift, he was signed by Phoenix. Following cameo roles in 23
Suns games and a knee injury, he became another American basketball
mercenary. First the CBA, then a prized Yankee-for-hire in Europe.
It's a nice life, but there are no vagabond shoe contracts.
</P>
<P>
   And no whining from Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left Lakewood,'' he said, ``I thought I'd be at USC for
four years and then start a career in something other than
basketball. So I think I've done pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   A broken foot (his) postponed Cooper's third season at USC and
put him on the school's five-year plan. He spent that fifth season
riding shotgun for All-American Harold Miner and providing enough
juice - 12 points and five assists per game - to interest the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, I thought I was reluctant to shoot,'' said Cooper,
who still maintains an agenda of asking questions first. ``Now I've
found a nice middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Cooper must find another employer, and realizes his best
financial opportunities probably exist overseas. But while
reconciling himself to that job market, he can't help hoping for a
call from closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' Cooper says of his ability to hold his
own in the big time. ``I compete with NBA guys all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all the time in the summer. Since the 1993-'94 season in
Phoenix, Coop's hoop odyssey has forced him to listen for the NBA's
siren song from distant ports.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he played in Poland until paydays became a mystery.
His agent, Don DeJardin, moved Cooper to Greece, where he was point
man for Panionios.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper probably will cross the water for the coming season, but
doesn't anticipate keeping the dream alive long enough to be
considered an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm already walkin' with a limp,'' he said of his hoop
longevity. ``As soon as you repair an ACL (anterior cruciate
ligament), arthritis sets in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper also realizes many outstanding players will pass
through the SPL and never get the opportunity to suit up for an NBA
team. So the limp could be see as a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   It means he's been somewhere.

   WASHINGTON _ The Olympic Pipe Line Company is not fully
cooperating with federal investigators and has not fulfilled
conditions necessary to reopen the portion of the line that
exploded in Bellingham, Wash., the nation's top pipeline-safety
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Coyner, the administrator overseeing the U.S. Department
of Transportation's pipeline safety programs, criticized the
company for not providing enough information to determine what went
wrong in Bellingham last month and to assess whether the pipeline
is now safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all satisfied,'' Coyner said during a wide-ranging
interview in her office. ``It is a challenge for the company to
respond in this environment, but this company has yet to step up to
the plate to provide the full picture of what is going on on the
(pipe)line.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Olympic submitted a document responding to actions
sought by the Office of Pipeline Safety in the aftermath of the
Bellingham explosion, which killed two boys and a teenager. The
company called the document an important step in beginning the
federal review process leading to reopening the closed part of the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Coyner released the 12-page introductory portion of the
company's response but withheld numerous attachments, saying that
she is not allowed to release the technical data because it is
private commercial information and because it is part of an ongoing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In its response, the company said its main computer and a backup
system had failed on June 10 because of inadequate processing
capacity, and it also said it has since upgraded the machines. The
company said it would test valves during a purging of the pipeline
system before startup.
</P>
<P>
   But the company asked the Office of Pipeline Safety to retract
its request for a survey of the condition of coating along the
pipeline, saying that there is no indication that this was a
problem in the Bellingham accident. The company also asked to be
allowed to conduct a hydrostatic pressure test of the pipeline only
in Bellingham _ not down the full length of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Coyner said even a cursory review of a document indicates that
the company has not met the federal requirements for reopening.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the basis of that response, we are not at this point
prepared to reopen the line,'' she said. ``We are reviewing what
they've given us, but there are also pieces of information that we
have not been given that have been promised. We're just not in any
kind of situation where on the basis of that we would reopen the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyner declined to estimate how long it would take to restart
the pipeline. She said the company itself has indicated that it
won't be able to supply some information sought by the government
until late next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't reopen it until we're satisfied that they have given
us information indicating that it is safe to reopen it,'' she said.
``We have to be confident that they have given us the information
that we've required, and secondly, once we get it, we have to have
confidence in it. If we don't, we're not reopening it, and that's
the basic bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Olympic Pipe Line Company said company
officials were shocked to hear of Coyner's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comments are of concern because we have felt we've been
very responsive,'' said the spokeswoman, Maggie Brown. ``We're
working very hard to cooperate with all investigators, and we will
redouble our efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that Olympic has supplied ``tons'' of documents to
federal investigators, has granted round-the-clock access to a
Department of Transportation investigator and has submitted a
comprehensive response to the federal agency's order for corrective
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be absolutely no reason for Olympic to want to
slow down this process,'' she said. ``We want to run a safe
pipeline. That's what we've done for 34 years, and we want to
figure out what happened here and make sure it never happens
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyner had some kind words for some steps that the company had
taken before the explosion, and argued that critical testimony from
the National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday may have left
the misimpression that certain safeguards were not in place in
Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
   Coyner said that, despite a dispute between her agency and the
safety board over how to write regulations in these areas, Olympic
had trained employees running the pipeline, had a leak detection
system in place and had inspected the pipeline using both a ``smart
pig'' _ a sensing device sent through the line _ and hydrostatic
testing, in which water is sent through the line at high pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Coyner also said that an initial review of previous testing of
the pipeline suggests no reason to question the line's integrity.
But she said the Office of Pipeline Safety is hiring an outside
expert to review the analysis of those tests, which are quite
complicated to interpret and sometimes fail to detect external
damage to a pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   But Coyner, whose actions in this case are being carefully
watched by Congress, the NTSB and residents of Bellingham, made a
point of repeatedly stating her unhappiness with Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information, based on when we've done accident
investigations in other things, is not coming forth the way it
needs to come forth,'' she said. ``There's just basic kinds of
things. At the outset we had challenges getting a hold of the
documentation about the computer system, and the process has been
one piece at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyner suggested that the company needs to be fully forthcoming
with any information reflecting on the integrity of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to underscore that it's the company's
responsibility to bring that information to the table,'' she said.
``It's not the investigators' responsibility to have to ask for
everything by page number to figure out what we're missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyner acknowledged that eight Olympic employees have refused to
testify for fear of incriminating themselves, but she added that
that does not wholly explain the company's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't make a person available who has a Fifth Amendment
right not to testify, but you can provide documents, you can
provide physical access, you can provide computer runs, and we
continue to press for that information,'' she said. ``It's been a
long, slow, tortured process to get that information from them, and
it's not that companies can't get this information.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyner said some information sought by the federal agency would
require time-consuming engineering work, but that for other
information ``it's getting a focus on what this is about, and it's
about their responsibility to give everybody confidence in their
(pipe)line. We have an oversight responsibility, but the company is
part of that community, and they've just got to come to the plate
and say, `Here's what we have: the good, the bad, and the ugly'.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyner said other pipeline companies have been subjected to
similar levels of scrutiny. She said the agency forced Colonial
Pipeline, the longest liquid pipeline in the country, to spend
millions of dollars on changes after an accident involving its
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a high level of scrutiny,'' she said of the agency's
attitude toward Olympic. ``It's not an unheard of level of
scrutiny.''

BABY STEPS FOR L.A. BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Los Angeles bid to acquire the next NFL franchise
kept taking baby steps Wednesday, leaving some to wonder whether it
can ever walk all the way to completion.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners met here for two days, heard the first Los Angeles
``team'' presentation from Gov. Gray Davis' representative, nodded
their heads at the wonderful progress that had been made, and then
flew off to each of their 31 cities without taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chadwick, welcome to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick is the investment banker Davis asked six weeks ago to
organize the Los Angeles franchise effort, which included bringing
the rival would-be ownership groups _ Michael Ovitz-Ron Burkle and
Eli Broad-Ed Roski Jr. _ together behind one plan.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are happy with the Coliseum renovation design and
Exposition Park site plan, which is basically the Ovitz design, but
remain skeptical over the economics. Which, translated, means: We
want more public money.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick presented the owners with an exclusive negotiating
agreement for the stadium lease, which included some new details
but not too many, that already had been agreed to by the Coliseum
Commission and the California Science Center (Chadwick is the
board's director).
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectation is, we will have (the owners) sign off on that
document by the end of the week,'' Chadwick said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said later that the
league would not sign the agreement, but would work under its
framework. Instead of signing on, Tagliabue said, the expansion
committee co-chairmen would send Chadwick a letter of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't sign off on the entire document,'' Tagliabue said.
``There are things in there we agree with, and things in there we
are not in agreement with. It will need further negotiations. There
are some economic issues that need to be improved upon so a team
can be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Several owners are concerned that the agreement as designed by
Chadwick is too severe economically and would make it difficult for
a team to flourish in Los Angeles. The 30-year lease calls for an
annual $5 million payment, and some revenues that normally would go
to the team will be used as debt service on the $150 million worth
of bonds Chadwick ultimately will propose to build new parking
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the NFL will look to wiggle public funding beyond
bonding, however masked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not sufficient to allow a team to work,'' Tagliabue
said. ``You couldn't field a competitive team.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cost of renovating the Coliseum goes up every
time it's mentioned. When Broad and Ovitz made their separate
proposals to the owners in May, Broad was talking about spending
$275 million and Ovitz $295 million. The NFL estimated it would
cost closer to $400 million last week, and by Wednesday Chadwick
was talking about $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the commissioner said was, it was somewhere between $350
to $600 million,'' Chadwick said. ``And that's a big somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the $150 million for parking.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick might not have gotten the NFL to sign his agreement,
which is nonbinding anyway, but Tagliabue said the league's letter
of support will recommend to owners that the NFL financially aid
the Coliseum renovation. The NFL is expected to contribute $150
million toward the new Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   But if the expansion fee is $500 million, and the team owner
still has to contribute $300 million toward the Coliseum, that
leaves a very thin profit margin for an enterprise Broad said is
expected to generate $25 million to $28 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, when I started, if I thought the returns would be
this skimpy, I'm not sure I would have started,'' Broad said. ``But
once you get involved, you're willing to do things that don't make
the greatest amount of economic sense.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite saying the league would establish a franchise fee to
avoid an auction, Tagliabue said Wednesday that he expects both
ownership groups to make offers prior to the Sept. 15 deadline
given Los Angeles for satisfying the league's expansion demands.
Then, he said, a franchise fee would be set.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the great Chinese jigsaw puzzles of all time,''
Ovitz said. ``Some of the problem Bill's had to date is, no one
wants to put their foot in the water first. Who's going to jump in
first _ the state, the ownership group, the NFL? I think what
you're seeing now is everyone converging into one plan.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever so slowly.

EMMITT SMITH SAYS NFL NEEDS TO KEEP SANDERS AT ANY COST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith
said the NFL should step in and do whatever it takes to keep Barry
Sanders from retiring. Emmitt's logic: Unprecedented action?
Unparalleled player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league should step in because we're losing a
cornerstone of the National Football League,'' Smith said. ``There
have been only four guys in NFL history to rush for over 2,000
yards (in a season). He is one of those guys, plus he has been a
stand-up individual for the league for 10 years. The man deserves
to be on a winning team.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who came into the league one year after Sanders, has been
on three Super Bowl championship teams. Sanders has been on Detroit
Lions teams that have won only one playoff game in his 10 NFL
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   With Sanders retiring, Smith now becomes the NFL's leading
active rusher. He is fifth on the all-time career rushing list with
12,566 yards _ 4,161 yards behind Payton _ and could be the one
chasing down that record in three seasons or so.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith wasn't thinking of himself Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he would tell Sanders if he could talk to him,
Smith pleaded: ``Come on back! Don't let me be the Lone Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was genuinely moved and shocked by the news that
Sanders was quitting in spite of the fact that he is at the top of
his game and capable of breaking the NFL's all-time rushing record
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barry would've been the first back to actually break
the 20,000-yard barrier before he was done,'' Smith said. ``I
really believe that because he's a running back with many, many
more years in front of him. This is an unfortunate situation. Maybe
he will reconsider and come back, or maybe they might trade him
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry was always a benchmark for me. He was always someone I
was chasing in terms of being the best running back in the National
Football League, just as he was one of the greatest _ if not THE
greatest _ ever to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was blindsided by the news upon showing up a day
early for camp Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all have to be joking,'' Smith said when first informed of
the news. ``Barry is not retiring. I don't buy it, just yet. The
man has many, many, many more years left. But I can sympathize with
his situation up there. The man has been everything Detroit wanted.
But has Detroit been everything he needed? Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that the two players never talked about the effects
of those bad Lions teams (78-82 overall) that apparently has driven
Sanders into early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Could Emmitt walk away with the rushing record in sight?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Smith replied. ``I can't put myself in his
situation. You can't compare apples and oranges. (Cowboys-Lions)
are two different things.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is coming off a 1,332-yard season with 13 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs feel fine,'' he said. ``I'm far from retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   And he wishes Sanders felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barry chooses to leave the game, that's his choice,'' Smith
said. ``But I wish he wouldn't retire at the present moment because
I would love to see him break the record. He has a great
opportunity to do it this year. It would be exciting to watch. It
would be a part of history.'' nn

has found fitting expression in the alluring new Museum of

medieval old town, the museum has a smoothly turned drum tower, a
furrowed roof terrace, slender windows and a sandstone exterior
with the amber flush of a sunset spreading across a Highland moor.
Enter and you're in a luminous castle keep. Indoor bridges span the
lofty courtyard space and staircases and narrow passageways
disappear invitingly into walls. It is a building of chanced-upon
spaces that promise a series of adventures. By Warren Hoge.

RANGERS OFFICIAL DISMISS REPORTS OF GONZALEZ TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Rangers assistant general manager Dan O'Brien
dismissed a report in Wednesday's editions of ``The Washington
Times'' that claimed the organization discussed trading right
fielder Juan Gonzalez to the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Times'' cited an American League executive who said the
two organizations discussed a proposal in which the Rangers would
receive right-hander Mike Mussina and right fielder Albert Belle
from the Orioles for Gonzalez and center fielder Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   That trade proposal would be difficult to consummate.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts of Mussina and Belle include no-trade clauses, and
Gonzalez's contract contains a limited no-trade provision. The
contract allows the Rangers' two-time American League most valuable
player to choose 10 organizations to which he will not accept a
trade. It is not known, though, whether the Orioles are among those
10.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez missed his second consecutive start and third in four
games with a ligament strain in his right wrist and remains
day-to-day. WETTELAND'S STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland surrendered his single-season high ninth
home run Tuesday to Orioles center fielder Brady Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   It was at least the third time this season that an opposing
player hit a leadoff, ninth-inning home run against Wetteland on a
first-pitch fastball in which the opponent trailed by more than one
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to try to trick them there to get them out and
end up walking them and putting the tying run on base,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said of Wetteland. ``He's going to make them
hit it to get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland expected Anderson to take the first pitch with the
Orioles trailing by three runs and threw a first-pitch fastball in
an attempt to get ahead in the count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand the thinking there when you're three
runs down with the middle of the order coming up, but that's
happened a lot this year,'' said Wetteland, who pitches according
to the situation. ``In one respect, it shouldn't be happening in
those situations. On the other hand, it didn't happen as much in
the past because I threw harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow
during October, acknowledged that the 2-3 mph loss in velocity on
his fastball has played a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very typical byproduct of having surgery,'' Wetteland
said. DECISION ON GOODWIN
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Tom Goodwin expects a decision could be made this
weekend regarding his upcoming medical rehabilitation assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, who went on the 15-day disabled list July 28 with a
torn muscle in his left hip flexor, put the leg through a strenuous
test Wednesday and plans to do it again Friday at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know more after we leave here,'' Goodwin said. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Butch Wynegar, the Rangers' roving minor-league hitting
instructor, will resume those duties after the Rangers complete
their three-game series with the Orioles. Wynegar accompanied the
Rangers to Baltimore as an extra pitcher for batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kansas City Royals announced right-hander Kevin Appier as
their scheduled starter for Sunday's game at The Ballpark in
Arlington. Most expect the Royals to trade Appier before Saturday's
trade deadline.

AIRLINES WEIGH CALLING OFF AN ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposed alliance between American Airlines and British
Airways may be called off as early as this week because the two
airlines cannot get approval from U.S. and British regulators,
according to people close to the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The two airlines have sought for three years to form a global
alliance that would allow them to coordinate schedules, sell each
others' tickets and share some profits. But the plans require
grants of immunity from antitrust rules that so far they have not
gotten.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines have sharply criticized the proposed alliance,
saying it would make it far more difficult to compete on flights
between the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation has made it clear that it
will approve the alliance only if British officials allow other
U.S. carriers to use London's Heathrow Airport. Under a current
treaty, only American, a unit of the AMR Corp., which is based in
Fort Worth, and United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corp., are
allowed to use Heathrow. Other U.S. carriers use Gatwick
International Airport, London's second airport.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines executives declined on Wednesday night to say
what would happen to the alliance. ``However this plays out,
American and British Airways will continue to build on the good
relationship they have developed in the past three years,'' said
John Hotard, an American spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was first reported by the Financial Times of London
in an article published in Thursday's early editions. That article
quoted British Airways as having said that it still wanted to
pursue the American alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The planned alliance, if it comes about, would carry nearly
two-thirds of the traffic between the two countries and form the
core of a larger alliance, called Oneworld, that would include
several other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, British Airways said that it would settle for a
five-year phase-in of the alliance, after concluding that demands
by European officials that the two airlines give up 267 weekly
takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow was too great a price to pay
for quicker approval of the alliance.
