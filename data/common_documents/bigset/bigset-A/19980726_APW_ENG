	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Profiles of the main party leaders
in Cambodia's parliamentary elections:
 &UR; ----
	   HUN SEN: Supremely self-confident, Hun Sen, 47 joked with
reporters that he is not just the ``dictator'' they describe him
as, but a ``superman.'' Few dispute he is one of Cambodia's most
astute politicians and an able administrator.
	   Hun Sen has been Cambodia's unrivaled top leader since deposing
his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a violent
takeover last year that devastated Phnom Penh with fighting and
looting by his victorious soldiers.
	   As ruthless as he is clever, Hun Sen is also widely believed to
be behind a string of human rights abuses, including the killings
of dozens of Ranariddh's supporters in the aftermath of the coup
and a score of opposition activists in the run-up to Sunday's
polls.
	   In 1970, as Cambodia started down the road that led to the
disastrous rule of the communist Khmer Rouge and decades of civil
war, the peasant's son joined the guerrillas at age 19.
	   Hun Sen was wounded five times in the bitter struggle against a
U.S.-backed military regime and lost his left eye to an artillery
shell April 16, 1975, the day before the Khmer Rouge marched into
the capital.
	   After taking power, the Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many
as 2 million Cambodians in a crazed attempt to build a communist
agrarian paradise. One Cambodian in five perished of overwork,
illness, starvation and systematic executions.
	   Though he attained the rank of regimental commander, there is no
reason to believe Hun Sen played a part in Khmer Rouge atrocities.
His June 1977 escape to neighboring Vietnam made him one of the
earliest high-ranking guerrilla defectors.
	   They became the nucleus of a government installed by the
Vietnamese after Hanoi's army drove the Khmer Rouge from power in
1979. At age 27, Hun Sen was named foreign minister of a
single-party, Soviet-style regime which hosted a Vietnamese
occupying army until 1989.
	   In 1985, Hun Sen became the world's youngest prime minister, a
post he held alone until the U.N.-supervised election of 1993. The
results of the poll brought him into a coalition government with
Ranariddh, a leader of the anti-Vietnamese resistance coalition.
	   Hun Sen made sure his Cambodian People's Party retained control
of the security forces and other levers of power. From that
position of strength he was able to launch his coup.
 &UR; ----
	   PRINCE NORODOM RANARIDDH: Seeking to regain the prime minister's
post he lost last year to co-premier Hun Sen in a coup, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh's main asset is his bloodline.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party represents Cambodia's royalists and
adoring crowds pay obeisance they would never give an ordinary
politician, though he maintains a strained relationship with his
father, King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   In appearance and speech, 54-year-old Ranariddh resembles his
father. But while Sihanouk remains one of the great _ if
controversial _ political figures of 20th-century Asia, his son
often appears as someone who wields power reluctantly.
	   His previous career as a lecturer in law and politics in France
often seems more suitable to his temperament. He entered real
politics only in 1983, when his father called on him to head the
resistance movement against what was then a Vietnamese client
regime in Phnom Penh.
	   Ranariddh fled Cambodia just before last year's coup, forewarned
that something might be brewing. His first statements from exile
were conciliatory in tone, a contrast to the sharp violence of the
takeover.
	   FUNCINPEC won the most parliamentary seats in 1993's
U.N.-supervised election, but to avoid a confrontation with Hun
Sen's incumbent Cambodian People's Party he agreed to form a
co-premiership. By retaining control over the police and military,
however, Hun Sen ensured he was first among equals.
	   Neither was Ranariddh able to hold the moral high ground. After
years of fighting a resistance war, many of Ranariddh's followers
were happy to siphon the spoils from even a partial share of power.
Ranariddh countenanced widespread corruption.
	   His seeming diffidence is not totally a liability. By enduring _
in absentia _ the humiliation of a show trial staged earlier this
year, Ranariddh was able to set the stage for his comeback to the
active political scene.
 &UR; ----
	   SAM RAINSY: Running at the head of a party named for himself,
French-educated economist Sam Rainsy is lucky to be alive.
	   On March 30, 1997, the maverick politician was leading a
demonstration opposite the National Assembly when several grenades
were tossed into the crowd. Sixteen people were killed and more
than 100 wounded. He escaped serious injury when one of his
bodyguards threw himself in front of him, absorbing the shrapnel.
	   Showing the media savvy that is his hallmark, Sam Rainsy
presented himself in front of foreign television crews even before
he could replace his shattered eyeglasses. He blamed co-premier Hun
Sen for the attack.
	   Articulate and skilled at self-promotion, the 49-year-old Sam
Rainsy has kept himself in the spotlight as the would-be voice of
clean government and friend of the working man.
	   Critics accuse him of demagoguery, and _ usually out of earshot
of the Westerners whose support he cultivates _ he engages in
anti-Vietnamese rhetoric common to Cambodian politics.
	   Appointed finance minister after 1993's U.N.-supervised
election, he was forced out of his job after 15 months for
denouncing corruption in his own FUNCINPEC party, headed by Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, and Hun Sen.
	   Sam Rainsy's expulsion from the post was a rare matter on which
the co-prime minister agreed. He was also booted out of FUNCINPEC
and expelled from the National Assembly. But his prominent gadfly
stance has inspired loyalty from Cambodians sick of misrule and
graft.
	   Sam Rainsy formed his own party in 1995 and has tried to build a
constituency among exploited factory workers.
	   One of the keys to his political survival has been his
relationship with King Norodom Sihanouk, who has often treated Sam
Rainsy more warmly than his own son, Ranariddh. Sam Rainsy's father
had been an adviser to Sihanouk who later turned enemy and
disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

Myanmar rejects Australian pressure for political reform

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Myanmar's foreign minister gave
``pretty negative'' responses when Australia tried Sunday to
pressure the Southeast Asian country to introduce democratic
reforms, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said.
	   Downer held talks with Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw in
Manila on the sidelines of an annual conference of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   Myanmar's military government has been internationally
criticized for widespread human rights abuses and for refusing
reconciliation with the National League for Democracy led by Aung
San Suu Kyi.
	   Tensions have risen over Suu Kyi's Aug. 21 deadline for the
convening of the national assembly that was elected in 1990, but
not recognized by the government.
	   Downer said he told Ohn Gyaw of Australia's ``serious concerns''
about the lack of dialogue with Suu Kyi's party, human rights
violations, and the lack of progress in the drafting of a new
constitution which the Myanmar government has said must be
completed before it yields power.
	   Ohn Gyaw's responses were not promising, Downer said.
	   ``I was told that the constitutional process was going ahead
inch by inch,'' Downer said. ``It seemed to be a very appropriate
way of putting it. I made the point that over the last 12 months
since I met Ohn Gyaw in Kuala Lumpur that nothing seems to have
happened.''
	   Downer said he proposed that Myanmar follow the example of
Indonesia under former President Suharto and establish an
independent human rights commission.
	   Ohn Gyaw ``did not respond in a negative way to that particular
proposal,'' Downer said without elaborating.

Agents search suspect's Montana cabin, parents issue apology
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from Montana neighbor on Weston's condition when
off medication, quote from former classmate. &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB ANEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIMINI, Montana (AP) _ Federal agents searched the tiny cabin of
the man accused of killing two U.S. Capitol police officers while
other agents converged on the Illinois home of his parents, who
apologized for their son.
	   Agents had a bomb-sniffing dog walk around the Montana cabin of
Russell E. Weston on Saturday before sending in a remote control
tractor that popped the padlocks from the home's door.
	   Investigators removed an old, black manual typewriter from one
of the two buildings that sit on the property in addition to the
tiny home.
	   Meanwhile, in the southwestern Illinois town of Valmeyer where
Weston grew up, several federal agents and local police hunkered
down at the home of Weston's parents, where they had arrived
Friday.
	   Police refused to say if they were waiting for a search warrant
or questioning Weston's parents.
	   Family pastor Rev. Robin Keating of the Zoar United Christian
Church read a statement from the parents outside their home.
	   ``It is with great sorrow that we speak today _ sorrow for the
families that lost their loved ones, sorrow for the children that
lost their daddies,'' the statement said. ``Our apologies to the
nation as a whole, for the trauma our son has caused. ... To say
that we are sorry is very inadequate.''
	   Keating said Rusty, as he is called, ``was a very isolated
person. He kept very much to himself. ... There absolutely was no
anti-government sentiment from the family or him.''
	   Weston was well known to authorities in Illinois and Montana.
	   In the midwestern state of Illinois, Monroe County Sheriff
Daniel Kelley said his office had up to eight contacts with Weston
in the past nine years. None of the contacts were violent and he
had never been arrested in the state, Kelley said.
	   He described Weston as having delusional episodes, and said he
was too much a loner to be in a militia.
	   Weston ``thinks voices came through televisions, those kinds of
things,'' Kelley said. ``There was nothing that was ever verifiable
in the contacts we had with him that would indicate there was
anyone out to get him.''
	   In the northwestern state of Montana, he was known as a
reclusive man who was ``that far off base,'' carried a grudge for
years and landed in a mental hospital because he threatened
President Bill Clinton.
	   Cobwebs filled the mailbox at his cabin, which is about 40 miles
(64 kilometers) from the spot where Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski
lived in a tiny shack.
	   Weston, a reclusive, man who hated and feared the federal
government but lived on its disability payments, had made numerous
threats over the years although no one in the area southwest of
Helena recalled that he ever did anything violent.
	   ``He always went right to the borderline,'' said Jefferson
County Undersheriff Tim Campbell. ``He always stopped just short of
being arrested for intimidation.''
	   Campbell said he was not surprised to hear of Weston's arrest in
Washington: ``I know Russell well, since 1982. The guy was that far
off base. It was no surprise.''
	   Weston, 41, was in critical condition Saturday at Washington's
D.C. General Hospital after undergoing a second operation for
gunshot wounds. His chances of survival were about 50-50, said Dr.
Paul Oriaifo.
	   Weston has been charged so far with one count of murdering
federal officers and was to be arraigned in absentia.
	   A judge committed Weston to the state mental hospital at Warm
Springs in late 1996 for an undisclosed incident, the governor's
office said. He was discharged after the hospital consulted with
his family.
	   A hospital employee, Jerry Swihart of Anaconda, said he worked
in the hospital warehouse with Weston, who volunteered that he had
been hospitalized for ``writing threatening letters to President
Clinton.''
	   ``He would rant and rave about how he was a personal friend of
Clinton and his family and then Clinton turned on him.''
	   A neighbor in Rimini, Ken Moore, said Weston believed the
government was using Moore's TV satellite dish to spy on him.
	   Russell Weston Sr., 66, described an argument that erupted at
his home Thursday because his son had used his shotgun to kill more
than a dozen cats.

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP)_ Police troops rescued two abducted
farmers after a brief gunfight with suspected Muslim extremists in
a southern Philippine mountain jungle, police said Sunday.
	   The two farmers were handcuffed together and had their feet tied
to a wooden post in a hut when found Saturday near Maluso town in
the island province of Basilan, police chief superintendent
Dominador Resos said.
	   Resos said about 20 Abu Sayaf rebels captured the two farmers
during a raid in Maluso's Upper Pali village Saturday morning. The
rebels took money, clothes, rice and dried fish from the mostly
Christian villagers and fled toward a forested mountain.
	   About 50 policemen later raided a rebel lair near Maluso and
engaged the guerrillas in a gunfight. The rebels later broke into
small groups and retreated, dragging wounded comrades, Resos said.
	   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more violent of two known
Muslim groups still waging a guerrilla war to establish a separate
Islamic state in the southern region of Mindanao, the traditional
homeland of the country's Muslim minority.

Election called Cambodia's ``last chance'' with international
</HEADLINE>
community &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The European Union's special envoy
to Cambodia's parliamentary elections said Sunday that the polls
amount to a ``last chance'' for the tragic Southeast Asian nation
to retain the interest of the international community.
	   Glenys Kinnock urged the Cambodian government led by strongman
Hun Sen to allow a violence-free election in which the country's
5.4 million registered voters can cast ballots secretly and without
fear of retribution.
	   Provided that a clean count of the vote takes place, she said,
Cambodia's political leaders need to accept the results and find a
way to work together.
	   ``I think they're very aware of the fact that their economy,
their stability depends on being part of the international
community,'' Kinnock said.
	   ``There has to be a signal to the rest of the world that they're
interested in joining. They need to show they're serious about all
this.''
	   The election is the first since the United Nations spent dlrs 3
billion and dispatched 20,000 peacekeepers to organize polls in
1993 meant to usher in peace and democracy after decades of civil
war and the Khmer Rouge-sponsored genocide of the late 1970s.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's royalist party won the 1993 election,
but Hun Sen forced his way into a co-premiership by threatening
civil war. He then deposed the prince a year ago in fighting
between armed factions in the capital city of Phnom Penh.
	   Hun Sen, who first came to power in 1985 under the harsh
Vietnamese military occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge, has
called the election to win back international legitimacy and
foreign aid. But critics say he has used widespread violence,
including murder, and intimidation to ensure his Cambodian People's
Party wins.
	   The European Union has been the chief donor to the elections,
providing a third of the dlrs 34 million budget, and has a large
voice in the U.N. mission coordinating 678 foreign observers.
	   The group indicates it will endorse the vote if is ``broadly
representative of the will of the Cambodian people,'' a vaguer
standard than the ``free and fair'' phrasing some critics had
demanded.
	   Kinnock said it was clear coalition negotiations were under way,
since none of the three main parties _ led by Hun Sen, Ranariddh
and dissident Sam Rainsy _ would probably win a majority of the 122
National Assembly seats.
	   ``The next weeks and months are going to be very
controversial,'' Kinnock said. ``The main players are going to have
to swallow their pride, be very conciliatory and put the results
into practice. All of them have to be brought in to participate in
a serious way.''
	   Stephen Solarz, a former U.S. congressmen co-chairing an
independent American observation mission, said after visiting
several stations that it was ``premature to make any judgment about
the process as a whole.''
	   Solarz noted that the process seemed to be orderly in the main
cities but that the real test would be in the countryside and
villages, where Hun Sen's party is far better organized than the
opposition and there are fewer foreigners to spot wrongdoing.
	   Solarz said the high turnout indicated ``a deep desire on the
part of the Cambodian people to play a role in shaping their
destiny. But the very tranquilly so far could disguise some devious
manipulation that would affect the outcome.''

	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Victims were mourned and
survivors comforted Sunday at church services held along the strip
of Papua New Guinea's northwest coast struck by a deadly tsunami.
	   Aid workers and members of military medical teams assisting in
the rescue effort joined victims, relatives and other locals in
chapel services in the villages of Aitape and Vanimo, near the
disaster site.
	   Australian Army Father Glynn Murphy and Brother Benjamin Telu
led the service in Vanimo, held in English and the most widely
spoken language in Papua New Guinea, Pidgin.
	   ``God gave us the earth,'' Fr. Murphy told the congregation.
``The earth does not know what it does, the earth simply is. The
earth gives us food from the land, timber to build our homes,
places for love and laughter.
	   ``But sometimes the earth moves and stretches. And a week or so
ago it stretched under the sea. It lifted the sea and the sea had
nowhere to go but where it went.
	   ``Nobody did anything wrong. It is just the way the earth is.''
	   The official death toll from the tsunami that struck northwest
Papua New Guinea on July 17 is 1,500 people. About 2,000 others are
still missing, however, Papua New Guinea government spokesman Chris
Hawkins said.
	   The government had earlier feared that up to 6,000 were missing.
That figure was lowered after it revised the number of people who
had been estimated to be in the region when the tsunami hit, and as
bodies and survivors continue to be interviewed and identified.
	   Many villagers fled from the coastline and into the rugged
interior, making accurate counts of those killed or missing
difficult.
	   More than 4,500 people have been left homeless by the three
massive waves that crushed villages along a 35-kilometer (22-mile)
stretch of coastline following a 7-magnitude earthquake.
	   Worst hit were villages around Sissano Lagoon, where about 8,000
people lived. Four villages built on exposed sand spits were washed
into the lagoon, which remains littered with bodies caught in
impenetrable mangroves.
	   Fearing disease by contamination, rescue workers have sealed off
the lagoon to allow bodies to decompose or be eaten by crocodiles,
wild dogs or pigs.
	   Hawkins said the exact number of deaths will probably never been
known.
	   ``We are relying on relatives to say where people lived and
whether they were there when the waves hit,'' Hawkins told The
Associated Press. ``In some cases, whole families were killed so we
will never know.''
	   More than 550 persons are in critical condition in hospital. The
most serious threat is infection caused by sand ground into open
wounds. Bacteria which thrive in the tropical conditions live in
the coral sand.
	   Australian army spokesman Cpt. Mike Harris said Sunday that
patients from the two hospitals in Vanimo whose conditions have
stabilized would start to be moved to hospitals in the nearest
city, Wewak.
	   Tsunami victim patients would gradually been transferred to the
Papua New Guinea national health system, Harris said.
	   Australian military doctors who had planned to be in the area
for up to 10 days are now expecting to stay two weeks or longer to
help stem the infection rate.
	   Harris said no survivors have been found alive for the past five
days.

Hart admits mistake in starting Carlos Spencer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand coach John Hart
admitted he made a mistake by putting Carlos Spencer in the
starting lineup in Saturday's 13-3 Tri Nations rugby union test
loss to South Africa.
	   Hart said Spencer's failure to convert any of his five penalty
goal attempts cost his team the game.
	   ``The decision to play Carlos, in hindsight, proved to be the
wrong decision because he didn't kick the goals,'' Hart said. ``We
couldn't afford not to kick those goals.
	   ``We've now kicked just three from 13 in two tests and that's
including Andrew's (Mehrtens),'' Hart said. ``Three from 13 in two
tests is a pretty clear expression of where you are. It's a pretty
frightening ratio.''
	   The win was South Africa's first in New Zealand in 17 years and
handed the All Blacks a rare second consecutive defeat.
	   The Springboks took a firm grip on the Tri Nations competition
after a try by left winger Pieter Rossouw sealed the South African
victory, their first in New Zealand since 1981 in the 50th match
between the two countries.
	   New Zealand lost its opening Tri Nations match to Australia
24-16 two weeks ago and the South Africans beat Australia 14-13
last week.
	   Hart said he was accountable for the team's performance and took
full responsibility for the loss.
	   ``We're going through some difficult times and it's not an easy
situation,'' Hart said. ``It's not panic time. We've got to keep
going forward, there's no point dwelling in losses for too long.''
	   South African coach Nick Mallett says suggestions that the All
Blacks have hit rock-bottom are nonsense.
	   ``They're still a great side, they're absolutely right up
there,'' said Mallett, who posted his 11th consecutive win since
being appointed to the position last year.
	   ``Suddenly people are going to question _ are they really in the
doldrums? Absolutely, not. It's nonsense.''
	   Mallett said Saturday's match could have gone either way.
	   ``While it was 13-3, it was the sort of game you felt was on a
knife's edge until three minutes from the end,'' he said.
	   New Zealand will assemble in Christchurch on Tuesday to prepare
for Saturday's match against Australia.
	   A loss there will cost the team the Bledisloe Cup, their only
consolation after the Springboks virtually guaranteed themselves
the Tri Nations title with two away wins. (djp)

Myanmar opposition leader blocked on another trip outside capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's
colleagues expressed hope Sunday that a compromise would be reached
with Myanmar's military to end a standoff on a highway outside of
Yangon that has entered its third day.
	   ``We hope that it will end today,'' said Tin Oo, vice chairman
of the National League for Democracy, of which Suu Kyi is general
secretary.
	   As of mid-morning Sunday, Suu Kyi, a colleague and two drivers
were still stuck in her white sedan about 51 kilometers (32 miles)
west of Yangon, the capital.
	   The military stopped her there Friday morning as she was
attempting to travel to Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of
the capital, to meet some of her party members.
	   Suu Kyi has now spent two nights in the car surrounded by
soldiers, sandbags and barbed wire barricades put there by the
government to prevent her from driving on.
	   ``We are concerned about her health,'' Tin Oo said. ``But she is
a tough lady, and I think she will be okay. She can last three or
four days at least.''
	   He said he thought the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner would
return home if the military promises to let the party members she
wanted to meet come to Yangon.
	   On two previous trips on July 7 and 20, a compromise was reached
where the military brought people Suu Kyi was attempting to see to
her car.
	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner has made three attempts this
month to travel outside Yangon, and the military has stopped her
three times.
	   During the first attempt, more than 30 soldiers lifted Suu Kyi's
car with her inside it, and turned it around to face Yangon.
	   The military government denies she is under house arrest.
	   It issued a statement Saturday that said Suu Kyi was
``bullheaded'' and lacked a ``humanitarian vision.'' It accused her
of conspiring to ``portray Myanmar as a lawless and unstable
country where the democratic forces are being suppressed.''
	   Yet the military has cited no law that Suu Kyi is breaking by
traveling outside the capital to meet members of her party, which
is a legal organization in Myanmar.
	   Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   Suu Kyi was stopped near Anyarsu village at about 10:15 a.m.
Friday by local police who called the military authorities.
	   She was traveling to tell party members not to obey a military
order to report to the authorities twice a day under the ``Habitual
Offenders Act,'' a law reserved for those considered heinous
criminals by the government.
	   She also hoped to give encouragement to families of party
members who have been jailed by the military government.
	   Suu Kyi's party has sent an official letter of protest about
using the Habitual Offenders Act against her party's
representatives to Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the military
government.
	   The general has not replied.

Nuclear tests to be criticized at Asia-major powers security talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos ASEAN101-102
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Nuclear tests by India and Pakistan
are the main target for criticism in this week's Southeast Asia
security talks, but long-term nuclear powers such as the United
States and Russia will be pressed to set an example with faster
progress on disarmament.
	   The Asian economic crisis will also be high on the agenda.
	   ``At the same time as we condemn South Asia we also want to urge
the U.S. and Russia to continue making progress on START,'' the
nuclear arms reduction treaty, Alexander Downer, Australia's
foreign minister, said Sunday as he arrived for the ASEAN Regional
Forum.
	   He called for condemnation of the Indian and Pakistani tests,
much stronger language than the nine members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations used in a communique issued Saturday
deploring the weapons testing.
	   ``We were outraged by what France did in 1995,'' said Downer.
``The Indian and Pakistani tests have been a very serious
development for the region and for the world. It has led to a very
serious deterioration in the security environment of South Asia.''
	   India, the United States, Russia, China and Britain are the
nuclear power states attending the annual dialogue with Southeast
Asian nations Sunday through Tuesday.
	   Despite the tensions caused by the recent nuclear tests, the
region's economic crises remain the prime worry.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Japanese Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi, previously not scheduled to meet separately,
agreed to a quick dialogue session on Sunday, a few hours after
their arrivals. Obuchi also has meetings with the Russian and
Chinese foreign ministers during his 12-hour stop in Manila.
	   Obuchi, set to become his country's next prime minister, will
face demands for big tax breaks and quick enactment of laws to
reform Japan's debt-ridden banking system.
	   Japan's weaker, smaller neighbors are looking to Asia's largest
economy to pull them out of a year-old economic crisis. Japan is
also the biggest contributor to ASEAN development, and the biggest
investor in the region.
	   In their communique Saturday, the ASEAN foreign ministers
``deplored the series of nuclear tests conducted recently in South
Asia that exacerbated tension in the region and raised the specter
of a nuclear arms race.'' The language was the strongest yet they
had used toward Pakistan and India's tests.
	   But Australia's Downer proposed that when the Regional Forum
ends Tuesday, a concluding statement should use the stronger
language of condemnation.
	   The ASEAN foreign ministers on Saturday had also urged the
nuclear weapon states to take rapid and concrete steps toward total
elimination of such weapons. ASEAN seeks, in the meantime, to
create a nuclear weapons free zone in Southeast Asia, including a
ban on ships carrying the arms through international waters.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   They meet annually in the Regional Forum with Australia,
Cambodia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South
Korea, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Russia, and the United
States.
	   In addition, Britain and Germany are sending separate
representatives this year to participate in the Post-Ministerial
Conferences that take place Wednesday and Thursday.

Australia wants multilateral criticism of South Asia nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo ASEAN102

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Australian government said Sunday
it will urge a multilateral conference on security in Asia to
condemn the recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
	   ``The French nuclear tests in 1995 were condemned and deserved
to be condemned. So too do the Indian and Pakistani tests,'' said
Australia's foreign minister, Alexander Downer.
	   ``They have led to a serious deterioration in the security
environment of South Asia.''
	   Australia is among the participants in the annual Regional Forum
sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which
gathers top officials from ASEAN, along with representatives from
other countries including the United States, Russia and China.
	   The forum opens in Manila Sunday night with an informal dinner
and concludes on Tuesday.
	   Downer added that Australia hopes the security forum will
encourage India and Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty.
	   ASEAN member foreign ministers deplored the tests in a joint
statement issued Saturday as they ended two days of talks. They
said the tests destabilized all of Asia and threatened the
principles of an ASEAN treaty aimed at keeping Southeast Asia free
of nuclear weapons.

Eritrean president flies to Libya, meets Gadhafi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki has held
talks with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on his country's simmering
border dispute with Ethiopia, state-run Libyan television reported.
	   The visit on Saturday came after Afwerki arrived by plane in the
Libyan capital Tripoli, according to a broadcast on the television
that was monitored by the BBC in London.
	   It was unclear if Afwerki's flight violated U.N. sanctions,
which ban air travel to Libya.
	   The sanctions were imposed in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to
surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
passenger jet that killed 270 people.
	   At a summit in Burkina Faso in June, presidents of the
Organization of African Unity urged member states to ignore the
U.N. sanctions if they affect humanitarian or religious matters or
involve official OAU business.
	   The presidents of Burkina Faso, Chad and Niger flew to Tripoli
earlier this month in violation of the U.N. sanctions. Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak also flew to Libya to visit Gadhafi, but
U.N. officials said he had obtained a waiver from the sanctions.
	   The Libyan television report said that Afwerki had spoken with
Gadhafi about his health, the BBC said. The Libyan leader is
recovering from a July 6 operation to repair his hip, which Libyan
officials say he broke while exercising.
	   Afwerki's arrival at Tripoli airport was broadcast on Libyan
television, the BBC said.
	   He later told the television his visit aimed ``to discuss our
bilateral issues and the initiatives to find a peaceful solution to
the dispute with Ethiopia.''
	   Heavy fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia in June over their
disputed border left hundreds dead on both sides. Of late, the
situation has stalemated.
	   The United States and Rwanda initially presented a four-point
proposal for peace talks that included Eritrean withdrawal from
contested areas it occupied after May 6.
	   Eritrea balked, claiming it was only on territory rightfully
within its boundaries.
	   Four nations from the OAU also made apparent fruitless attempts
to get both countries to sit down for talks.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Five people were killed Sunday when a
chartered seaplane crashed into a hill at Berowra Waters, part of
Australia's popular Hawkesbury River system north of Sydney.
	   The plane crashed into a hill at Calabash Bay, north of the
Berowra Waters ferry wharf, an ambulance spokesman said.
	   The aircraft belonged to South Pacific Seaplanes, company
director Phil Handel said.
	   The four passengers and pilot killed were on a charter flight of
the region, Handel said.
	   He did not reveal the aircraft's planned destination, saying
only that the company operated a series of scenic and charter
flights over Sydney's harbor, beaches and mountains.

Protesters demand apprehension of looters, protection of Chinese

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ More than 1,000 protesters marched to the
Indonesian consulate in Hong Kong on Sunday to demand the
apprehension of looters in Indonesia and protection for the
Southeast Asian country's ethnic Chinese.
	   The demonstrators called on the government in Jakarta to stop
human rights abuses and sexual assault targeting ethnic Chinese,
who often are scapegoats in Indonesia in times of unrest.
	   Marchers carried banners saying, ``Protect human rights. No
violence,'' and ``Punish rapists.''
	   ``Strongly condemn violence in Indonesia. Indonesian government
must stop the violence,'' the protesters chanted during a 15-minute
march from a public park to the consulate.
	   Deputy Consul General Suhadi Salam received the protesters'
petition demanding that President B. J. Habibie apprehend the
looters, curb further violence and protect the Chinese community.
	   Ethnic Chinese were targeted in unrest that wracked Indonesia in
May, which culminated in the resignation of its long-time
president, Suharto. Women's groups say gangs committed at least 168
rapes, and that most of the victims were ethnic Chinese women and
girls.
	   Chinese make up only a tiny fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
people, but some indigenous Indonesians resent their control of
much of the economy.
	   Police said there were 1,200 protesters, although the
organizers, the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese General Association and
the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong
_ a major grassroots party _ claimed there were 3,000 people in
attendance.
	   Party chairman and lawmaker Tsang Yok-sing said the ethnic
Chinese fear more violence against them is possible next month when
Indonesia celebrates its independence day holiday.
	   The Chinese ``don't know when they'll have a safe home to go
back to. We demand that the Indonesian government to take immediate
action punish the looters and curb the violence,'' Tsang said.
	   ``I was very angry. They're trampling on our human rights,''
said a protester, H.Y. Lee, an Indonesian Chinese who moved to Hong
Kong in 1953. ``This is a country that wants to extinguish the
minority races.''
	   The Democrats, the territory's largest party, also planned an
evening candlelight vigil Sunday.
	   An unidentified person threw several raw eggs above the
consulate entrance, but was immediately stopped from conducting
further acts of vandalism by protest organizers.

Philippine Airlines reaches settlement with striking ground workers

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Striking ground personnel at
financially troubled Philippine Airlines agreed to return to work
Sunday after the company said it would reinstate 1,800 union
members laid off during an earlier strike by the airline's pilots.
	   The ground crew union agreed, however, on the need for
retrenchments to save the airline, and both sides accepted
guidelines on how it should be done, officials said.
	   ``We are very pleased,'' PAL executive vice president Manolo
Aquino said. ``This demonstrates the union's support for the
airline's rehabilitation and it will ensure the success of the
rehabilitation plan.''
	   An airline spokesman said PAL was proceeding with seven
international and more than 20 domestic flights with only minor
delays on Sunday, adding operations were expected to normalize in a
few days.
	   PAL had laid off 5,000 of its nearly 14,000 workers as part of a
massive retrenchment program triggered by the 22-day pilots' strike
last month.
	   All 1,800 returning workers will be members of the ground crew
union, union president Alex Barrientos said.
	   Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said the union agreed to the
retrenchment of a maximum of 1,800 ground crew personnel within the
next 21 days following a ``last in, first out'' policy enshrined in
the worker's collective bargaining agreement with PAL's management.
	   He said employees to be affected could opt for early retirement
with full benefits after which compulsory layoffs would follow.
Laid off workers would be prioritized in future hirings.
	   Laguesma said they will begin mediating with PAL's third union,
which represents flight attendants, over a similar settlement.
	   President Joseph Estrada has ordered labor officials to help
forge a compromise to end the labor unrest at PAL, saying a closure
of the flag carrier would embarrass the country.
	   Estrada was scheduled to meet PAL's majority owner, business
tycoon Lucio Tan, leaders of the ground personnel union and labor
officials later Sunday for a formal signing of the agreement.
	   The strike, which began last Wednesday, came as foreign
ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations began
arriving in Manila for annual meetings. They were joined Sunday by
Cabinet officials from 10 other countries, including the United
States, Japan, China and European nations.
	   PAL branded the ground crew strike illegal because it was
prohibited by labor authorities who assumed jurisdiction over the
dispute on July 10.
	   The pilots' walkout was a devastating blow to the already
deteriorating financial condition of the 57-year-old airline,
Asia's oldest.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is discussing a rehabilitation program with Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes, and a sharp reduction of flights.

Report: Japanese police suspect festival food tainted with cyanide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police suspect someone of using cyanide to poison
curried rice served at an annual summer festival, after four people
died and dozens of others fell ill apparently upon eating the food,
a report said Sunday.
	   The exact cause of the deaths remains unknown, but vomit from
the victims showed evidence of a reaction to cyanide, the Kyodo
News service reported.
	   About 60 people attending the festival Saturday night in central
Japan's Wakayama prefecture were sickened after eating the curried
rice dish. More than 30 of them were hospitalized, the report said.
	   The four who died ranged in age from 10 to 64 years old, it
said.
	   Cases of food poisoning from spoiled items are common in Japan,
where raw seafood and semi-cooked dishes are popular fare. More
than two dozen people have suffered from poisoning linked to
tainted salmon roe so far this summer.
	   An outbreak of the O-157 strain of E. coli bacteria two years
ago killed 12 people, mostly small children and elderly people, and
sickened 10,000 others.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hoping for a fresh start toward
peace and stability, Cambodians swarmed polling stations Sunday to
vote for new leadership and put an end to festering tension
following a bloody power struggle last year.
	   For the first time in history, former Khmer Rouge guerrillas
took part in a democratic vote.
	   Foreign election observers predicted a high turnout and said the
result could surprise strongman Hun Sen, widely accused of
murdering opponents and intimidating voters to ensure he wins the
first parliamentary elections since U.N.-organized polls in 1993.
	   Stephen Solarz, a former U.S. congressman leading an independent
American observation mission, said that voting appeared to be
tranquil and orderly in the main cities, but that problems could
occur in the countryside, where the ruling party is well organized.
	   ``The very tranquility so far could disguise some devious
manipulation that would affect the outcome,'' Solarz said.
	   Voting at a school, Hun Sen kissed his ballot and rejected fears
he will call out the army if his Cambodian People's Party loses,
saying he was prepared to hand over power within hours after
results become known.
	   No party is expected to win a majority of the 122 National
Assembly seats up for grabs, making a coalition government likely.
That could mean either give-and-take power-sharing, or infighting
and turmoil as in the past.
	   ``If my party loses, I'm ready to be a coconut vendor or a
fishermen,'' said Hun Sen, 47, looking healthy after an emergency
appendectomy July 17. ``Today, one can see the Cambodian people
have achieved victory. I also share this victory.''
	   The main challengers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed
by Hun Sen as co-prime minister last year in fighting that
devastated parts of Phnom Penh, and former finance minister Sam
Rainsy cast ballots in the central town of Kompong Cham.
	   An upbeat Ranariddh said the election represented a ``choice
between democracy and totalitarianism'' and marked ``a great day
for democracy in Cambodia.''
	   Sam Rainsy, whose party has suffered the brunt of pre-election
killings, was more somber.
	   ``It can be a turning point,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``I hope it
will, but I have no illusion. At least it shows the Cambodian
people want to vote. We can be disappointed later at the result.''
	   Phnom Penh was calm and voting proceeded so quickly that some
stations were empty by noon. But in the remote northern jungles,
the army was on high alert to prevent die-hard remnants of the
Khmer Rouge from preventing thousands of ex-comrades who have made
peace in recent years from voting.
	   In Pailin, a gem-rich former Khmer Rouge base that led the first
mass defections two years ago, former guerrillas lined up to vote.
Their leader, Ieng Sary, threw his support behind Hun Sen last
week.
	   Ieng Sary was foreign minister in the Khmer Rouge regime that
caused the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians between 1975
and 1979. Widely accused of crimes against humanity, he received a
pardon in exchange for leading his men to peace.
	   ``This is the first time in my life that I've participated in
voting,'' Ieng Sary said. Under the Khmer Rouge regime, belief in
such practices would have meant certain death.
	   Millions of ordinary Cambodians started heading to the 11,600
polling stations at daybreak. One of the first to vote was Chan
Somphon, 51, a farmer living at a Buddhist pagoda since a land-mine
tore off his left leg. One in every 300 Cambodians has been killed
or maimed by the millions of mines buried during three decades of
civil war.
	   Leaning on a crude wooden crutch, Chan Somphon chose from the 39
parties, dropped his ballot into a locked metal box and had his
finger dipped in purple ink, a precaution to prevent multiple
voting.
	   ``I want peace for Cambodia,'' said Chan Somphon who, like most
voters, refused to state his party preference. ``No more war. I
want peace everywhere. If the vote is honest, we will have peace.''
	   In another neighborhood, hundreds of people waited in lines
snaking through a schoolyard as the process slowly got underway.
The affluent dressed in their best clothes; the poor shielded their
heads from the sun with traditional checkered scarves.
	   One mother and child arrived in a cyclo-pousse, a hybrid between
a rickshaw and a bicycle, and brought food and water in case the
wait was long. The opposition expressed fear Hun Sen's supporters
would arrive early and drag out the process, keeping opponents from
voting before polls closed at 4 p.m. (1000 GMT).
	   ``I feel the Cambodian people may well surprise everyone
today,'' said Glenys Kinnock, special representative of the
European Union.
	   Hun Sen was also favored to win the 1993 vote, but lost. Despite
20,000 U.N. peacekeepers, he thwarted the result and forced the
winner, Ranariddh and his royalist FUNCINPEC party, to share power
under threat of civil war.

Thai elephant dies after falling into Bangkok sewer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A 70-year-old elephant died from
internal bleeding and other injuries after it fell into a Bangkok
sewer where it was trapped for four hours, local papers said
Sunday.
	   The three-ton bull elephant broke its tusks, legs and sustained
internal injuries when it fell into the sewer on Friday evening,
The Nation newspaper quoted veterinarians as saying.
	   Its front legs were stuck in the sewer, inflicting serious
muscle injuries to the forelimbs while forcing the hind legs to
sustain all of its weight.
	   After it was rescued, the elephant, named Sethi, was given 3
liters (3.18 quarts) of saline solution and two injections of
pain-reliever, but collapsed and died on Saturday.
	   On the same day Sethi perished, the Agriculture Ministry
announced it would open the first state-run elephant hospital by
the middle of 1999 in Surin Province, 340 kilometers (211 miles)
northeast of Bangkok.
	   But more is needed to help the animals than a hospital. Sethi
was one of scores of elephants roaming the streets of Bangkok.
	   Although it is illegal to bring an elephant into the city, their
mahouts, or keepers, say they can no longer survive in the country
because open ranges have been taken away by developers.
	   So they beg on the streets of the capital, or sell fruits and
vegetables to passersby who feed them to the elephant. Some Thais
pay a small fee to walk under the elephant's belly, believing it
will bring them good luck.
	   Loss of habitat and exploitation by humans has caused the number
of elephants in Thailand to decline to 6,000 from an estimated
300,000 at the turn of the century.
	   They were once indispensable for logging and transport. Today,
with logging illegal in deforested Thailand, many are abused by
gangs who log illegally, force feeding them amphetamines so they
will work longer and harder and discarding them when they become
sick or old.
	   The government earlier this year designated March 13 National
Elephant Day to heighten public awareness of the plight of the
animal which has officially been Thailand's national symbol since
1963.

Long trip back for Cambodian prince, from coup to vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KOMPONG CHAM, Cambodia (AP) _ A year after he was ousted as
Cambodia's co-prime minister in a bloody coup, a confident Prince
Norodom Ranariddh went to the polls Sunday to try to climb back
into power.
	   ``It's been a very, very long journey for me since the coup and
I have to say thanks to the world community, countries like the
United States and Japan, who are clearly not supporting me but the
principle of democracy,'' Ranariddh said.
	   Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC won U.N.-sponsored elections in
1993, but strongman Hun Sen, who led the country as a single-party
state with Vietnamese backing in the 1980s, forced his way into a
tense co-premiership by threatening renewed fighting.
	   Though Ranariddh was named First Prime Minister, Hun Sen
retained control of the security apparatus and resolved worsening
tensions with the prince by deposing him in two days of pitched
battles in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital.
	   Diplomatic pressure and Hun Sen's need for international
legitimacy led to Sunday's elections. The prince, who campaigned
hard against Hun Sen and opposition rival Sam Rainsy, said everyone
had ``learned a bitter, bitter lesson from 1993.''
	   This time, if he wins, there will be no co-premiership,
Ranariddh said, though he's still willing to envision a coalition.
	   Ranariddh said that he will do his best to make Cambodia ``a
really liberal and democratic country.''
	   The opposition has charged Hun Sen with packing the electoral
machinery with his own supporters, denying access to the media and
using intimidation and violence to ensure victory.
	   ``Now we have to wait for the end of the day and also the
counting, and then the general assessment by the party agents and
representatives of friendly countries and foreign observers,''
Ranariddh said.
	   Hun Sen has justified last year's coup by accusing Ranariddh of
plotting his own takeover with former Khmer Rouge guerrillas. The
prince was tried in absentia in a show trial as part of a
complicated deal to allow him to return. He later received a pardon
from his father, King Norodom Sihanouk.

Russians win second diving gold

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Russia cornered the market in women's
diving gold medals at the Goodwill Games on Saturday night when
world champion Yuliya Pakhalina easily won the 3-meter competition.
	   Pakhalina, who said she was not upset about finishing fourth in
the 1-meter diving Thursday, was in first place after all 10 rounds
in her specialty.
	   In fact, she had enough points after nine rounds to win the gold
medal. It was Russia's second gold in two women's diving events.
	   ``I was not disappointed in the 1-meter because that is not my
best event. Tonight was my element,'' Pakhalina said through an
interpreter. ``I was sick for awhile, so this was my first
competition in several months. I was determined to do well.''
	   Pakhalina finished with 559.83 points, while silver medalist
Chantelle Michell of Australia, who finished third in this year's
world championships, had 488.19. Going into the final round,
Pakhalina had 495.45 points.
	   Pakhalina so dominated the competition that she had 32 awards of
either 8.5 or 9.0 from the judges, while Michell's had no scores
that high.
	   ``I won a bronze medal at Perth (the world championships), and I
wanted to do at least that well here,'' Michell said. ``This
competition was as tough as the world championships, but I've
really been pointing to the Commonwealth Games as a more important
event.''
	   Michell edged third-place finisher Irina Lashko of Russia by
just 0.87 points when Lashko, the gold medalist in the Goodwill
Games 1-meter, scored just 35.10 points on her last dive. Michell,
diving just after Lashko, scored 55.89.
	   ``I was very nervous in the last two rounds because it was very
close for the silver and bronze medals,'' Michell said. ``She won
the silver medal in the Olympics and I was diving right behind
her.''
	   After eight rounds, less than 15 points separated second through
seventh place.
	   Erica Sorgi, 16, of Mission Viejo, California, and Laura
Wilkinson, 20, of Houston, had a good chance to win a medal going
into the final two rounds, but neither could manger more than 46
points on the final two dives.
	   Sorgi finished fifth with 480.06 points and Wilkinson slipped to
eighth with 463.74 behind seventh-place finisher Tracy Bonner of
Houston, who had 467.85.
	   ``I could've done much better on a couple of dives,'' Sorgi
said. ``I don't really know the international competition that
well, so it's hard to know what to expect.''
	   Guo Jingling of China, the silver medalist in 1-meter diving,
balked on one of her dives and got zero points, finished last among
11 divers.

Philippine police stage raid to remove defiant chief of freeport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 5th-7th grafs with details on injured, security at
freeport gates.

<TEXT>
	   SUBIC BAY FREEPORT, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of police used
tear gas in a pre-dawn raid Sunday on a Subic Bay Freeport
administrative building to evict holdout supporters of the
industrial park's former chairman.
	   The tear gas was fired before police special forces broke
windows on the second and third floors to enter the headquarters
building, which hundreds of supporters of dismissed freeport
chairman Richard Gordon had barricaded for nearly a month.
	   Hundreds of other backers of the ex-chairman gathered outside
the building and battled police with rocks and bottles. One fire
truck was set on ablaze and two others damaged. Dozens of warning
shots were fired into the air by police in an attempt to disperse
the crowd.
	   Police were able to take control of the building several hours
after the raid began, but Gordon was not found inside, officials
said.
	   A British national from London, Bob Couttie, who partly owns a
steak restaurant in the freeport and is the spokesman of its
chamber of commerce, was mauled by Gordon' supporters while
watching the melee, witnesses and officials said.
	   More than 20 policemen were injured, two of whom were
hospitalized with stab wounds, and about 40 Gordon supporters were
treated for contusions and bruises, they said.
	   Security was tightened at the freeport's gates and only those
working for factories and offices inside were being let in,
witnesses said.
	   A former U.S. naval base, the Subic Bay complex has become an
industrial zone showcasing economic growth in the Philippines.
	   An announcer on the SNN television network commented that it was
a sad day for the country as scenes of the fighting in Subic Bay
were broadcast.
	   In a telephone interview with a radio station from an
undisclosed location, Gordon appealed to President Joseph Estrada
to withdraw the police.
	   ``You assaulted people who were sleeping,'' he said. ``You are
the ones with power. Use your power for the people, not against the
people.''
	   President Estrada, who took office June 30, fired Gordon and
appointed long-time rival Felicito Payumo to take his place. Payumo
has been forced to set up a temporary office at the local airport.
	   Gordon insists his tenure has not ended. He was reappointed to
the post by former President Fidel Ramos early this year.
	   The move by Estrada, a former actor and senator who opposed U.S.
bases in the Philippines, to replace Gordan appeared to come in
retaliation for efforts by the business executive's followers to
prevent Estrada from making an anti-bases movie at Subic in 1991.
	   Estrada also accused Gordon of trying to sabotage his
presidential campaign in Olongapo, the city adjacent to Subic.
	   Gordon won a restraining order against Payumo that lapsed last
week. A local court refused to extend the restraining order but did
not rule on whether Gordon's dismissal by Estrada was legal.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the lower court's decision
not to extend Gordon's stay meant that Estrada's order firing
Gordon and installing Payumo could be implemented immediately.
	   The local chamber of commerce has said companies in the
freeport, which include Federal Express and Acer, suffered losses
totaling dlrs 3.5 million on July 1, when Gordon's supporters
temporarily barricaded all the freeport gates.

Thousands of Megawati supporters rally peacefully in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Several thousand supporters of
Indonesian opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri staged a noisy
but peaceful rally Sunday to commemorate the second anniversary of
a bloody 1996 crackdown against their party.
	   The demonstration was staged in Yogyakarta one day before
Megawati was due to hold her own commemoration in the capital,
Jakarta, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) to the west.
	   Police have banned Monday's protest, which was to be held in
Jakarta's main sports park, because of security concerns. About
9,000 troops and police have been put on alert despite assurances
from organizers that there will be no trouble.
	   Megawati, who was ousted as head of the Indonesian Democratic
Party, has criticized the ban as being against government promises
to allow free speech.
	   Many of her supporters have said they will defy the ban Monday.
	   Armed Forces chief Gen. Wiranto has defended the ban saying that
the mobilization of protesters in Jakarta could ``entail great
risks,'' the official Antara news agency reported.
	   Yogyakarta's rally proceeded without incidents in a square
adjacent to the palace of the ancient city's sultan.
	   Hundreds of Megawati supporters later drove through the streets
on motorcycles and in cars, waving banners and flags and chanting
slogans.
	   There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
	   Two years ago Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, gained wide popularity after she
criticized the autocratic policies of then President Suharto.
	   That led, however, to her ouster as party head in June 1996 by
pro-government rivals with the party.
	   Her supporters protested by occupying the party's Jakarta
headquarters. But on July 27 the military and police staged a
pre-dawn raid on the building.
	   The assault triggered major riots in which at least five people
were killed and dozens of others were reported missing.
	   The political fortunes of Megawati and other opposition figures
have risen following the resignation of Suharto in May after
Indonesia was rocked by more protests and riots amid the worst
economic crisis in 30 years.
	   His successor President B.J. Habibie has promised to reform the
tightly-controlled political system and to hold free elections next
year.

 &UR; Pirates 4, Braves 1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Pittsburgh, Turner Ward hit a bizarre inside-the-park home
run that bounced in front of home plate _ making up for a home run
lost to an umpire's call _ and Pittsburgh beat Atlanta.
	   The Pirates led 2-1 with two outs in the seventh when Ward
pinch-hit for Mark Smith. Ward hit a hard grounder that bounced up
the middle and deflected off the glove of second baseman Tony
Graffanino. The ball changed directions and took another wild carom
past center fielder Andruw Jones, allowing Ward to score well ahead
of the throw.
	   Francisco Cordova (9-8), 1-3 lifetime against the Braves
entering the game despite a 1.03 career ERA against them, pitched
five-hit ball for 7 2-3 innings to continue a midseason turnaround
with his third win in a row.
	   Denny Neagle (10-9) took the loss.
 &UR; Brewers 4, Expos 3
	   In Milwaukee, Jeromy Burnitz's second homer of the game, a solo
shot with one out in the bottom of the ninth, gave Milwaukee the
victory.
	   Burnitz went 3-for-4 in his second two-homer game of the season,
hitting his team-leading 23rd and 24th. His game-winner landed
about 20 rows deep in the right-field stands and made a winner of
Bob Wickman (4-6), who pitched two-thirds of an inning in relief of
Scott Karl.
	   Anthony Telford (3-4), who relieved Carlos Perez to start the
ninth, took the loss. Perez threw 117 pitches in eight innings,
allowing seven hits and no walks.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 5, Dodgers 3
	   In Los Angeles, Devon White doubled home two runs and scored
from second base on a wild pitch as Arizona rode a five-run fourth
inning to a victory over Los Angeles.
	   Former Dodger Omar Daal (4-5) got the victory by working 6 1-3
innings and despite allowing opposing pitcher Darren Dreifort (6-9)
to hit his first major league home run.
	   Daal, who spent parts of three seasons with the Dodgers as a
reliever, started against them for the first time after facing them
six times out of the bullpen. He struck out four and walked one
while ending the Diamondbacks' three-game losing streak.
	   Gregg Olson got the final three outs for his 16th save in 17
opportunities.

Opposition leader: Government wants legislature to be rubber stamp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The leader of Hong Kong's de facto opposition
said Sunday that the Chinese territory's government wants to reduce
the legislature into a rubber stamp by stripping it of power.
	   In an address on official Radio Hong Kong, legislator Martin
Lee, chairman of the Democrats, the main opposition party,
condemned Solicitor-General Daniel Fung for trying to curb the
legislature's power.
	   Fung said earlier that the constitution adopted after Hong Kong
was handed back from Britain to China last year no longer allows
legislators to introduce amendments to government bills relating to
official policies without the chief executive's consent.
	   He asked legislators to amend their rule book to reflect the
change. Lawmakers have refused Fung's request, however, arguing
that they retain a constitutional right to amend government bills.
	   ``It is obvious the government wishes to reduce the legislature
into an absolute rubber stamp,'' Lee said.
	   ``The question is, why did Mr. Fung write such a letter?,'' Lee
said. ``Did he write it because he was instructed by his boss,
(the) chief executive, to write it?''
	   The territory's legislature acts largely as an advisory body to
monitor the government, while career civil servants and a handful
of handpicked elite advisers have a monopoly in policymaking. None
are elected officials.
	   The legislature has become even less powerful after the handover
from British rule because the new constitution took away powers to
introduce private members' bills relating to public expenditure,
political structure or the operation of the government.

Australia wins qualifying encounter 5-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Sydney schoolgirl Jelena Dokic lost
only seven games while winning twice to lead Australia to a 5-0
victory over Argentina in a weekend Fed Cup tennis qualifying
round.
	   Dokic, 17, and Nicole Pratt, 25, made their first Cup singles
appearances for Australia. The win ensured Australia stays in World
Group II next year while Argentina is relegated to regional
qualifying.
	   Pratt won Sunday's first reverse singles match, beating Mariana
Diaz-Oliva 7-6 (7-4) 6-1, to give the home side a winning 3-0 lead,
having beaten Celeste Contin 6-2, 6-4 on Saturday.
	   With the pressure off, Dokic took just 51 minutes to dispose of
substitute player Laura Montalvo 6-2, 6-1. The win followed Dokic's
6-2, 6-2 defeat of Diaz-Oliva in the opening match Saturday.
	   Rachel McQuillan and Kerry-Anne Guse beat Laura Montalvo and
Erica Krauth 6-4, 6-3 in the meaningless doubles match Sunday.

Rapids 3, Mutiny 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ Wolde Harris scored on a header from
point-blank range with six minutes left as the Colorado Rapids
snapped a seven-game road losing streak with a 3-2 victory over the
Tampa Bay Mutiny on Saturday night.
	   Harris redirected Adrian Paz's cross past goalkeeper Doug Petras
to hand Tampa Bay (6-16) its fifth consecutive home loss.
	   Tampa Bay's Alan Prampin ran his point-scoring streak to a
club-record seven games with a 63rd-minute goal that tied the match
2-2. That came just seven minutes after Paul Bravo's eighth goal of
the year put Colorado in front.
	   The Rapids opened the scoring in the 31st minute on Marcelo
Balboa's goal. Tampa Bay defender Chris Houser tied it six minutes
later with his first MLS goal.
 &UR; MetroStars 3, Fire 2
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Miles Joseph scored one goal and
assisted on one to spark the New York-New Jersey MetroStars to a
3-2 victory over the Chicago Fire in Major League Soccer.
	   The MetroStars (11-9) have won four of five. The expansion Fire
(13-8) have lost three straight.
	   In the sixth minute, Eduardo Hurtado volleyed in a crossing
header from Marcelo Vega.
	   Chicago tied it in the 19th minute, when a free kick by Lubos
Kubik caromed off the defensive wall and dribbled into the left
corner of the goal.
	   The MetroStars took the lead for good in the 25th minute.
Chicago defender Francis Okaroh attempted a clearing header, but
Joseph got a foot on the ball and rolled a shot just inside the
right post.
	   In the 45th minute, Joseph crossed the ball to Brian Kelly, who
charged hard from the right to knock in his fifth goal of the
season.
	   Roman Kosecki added Chicago's final goal in the 85th minute.
 &UR; Burn 2, Crew 1
	   In Columbus, Ohio, Jorge Rodriguez scored in the 85th minute to
give the Dallas Burn a 2-1 victory over the Columbus Crew.
	   Dallas (10-11) snapped a four-game losing streak, with Rodriguez
scoring the winning goal off Ted Eck's pass following a corner
kick.
	   The Burn opened the scoring in the 10th minute on Mickey
Trotman's unassisted goal, and the Crew (9-10) tied it in the 41st
minute on Todd Yeagley's goal. A crowd of 15,628 attended the game
at Ohio Stadium.
 &UR; United 1, Galaxy 0
	   In Pasadena, California, Los Angeles defender Robin Fraser
deflected Marco Etcheverry's cross into the net for an own goal in
the 44th minute as D.C. United beat the Galaxy 1-0.
	   United goalkeeper Scott Garlick made five saves for his sixth
shutout.
	   United midfielder Mario Gori was ejected in the 16th minute when
he received his second yellow card, and Galaxy forward Welton was
sent off in the 57th after elbowing D.C. defender Carey Talley in
the head.
	   United has won five straight to improve to 18-5. Los Angeles is
16-5.
	   The matchup of conference leaders drew an announced crowd of
26,873 to the Rose Bowl.
 &UR; Clash 2, Wizards 1
	   In San Jose, California, San Jose's David Kramer made three
consecutive saves in a shootout to give the Clash a 2-1 victory
over the Kansas City Wizards.
	   San Jose's Eric Wynalda, Eddie Lewis and Victor Mella scored on
their shootout attempts, while Kramer stopped attempts by Mark
Chung, Preki Radosavljevic and Mo Johnston.
	   Wynalda gave the Clash (7-13) a 1-0 lead in the 42nd minute, and
Johnston tied it three minutes later on a free kick. The Wizards
are 9-11.

St. George stays in hunt in National Rugby League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ St. George, trailing 12-4 late in the
first half, kept alive its top four hopes after coming from behind
to beat Sydney City 22-12 in a National Rugby League match Sunday.
	   The Dragons came back to score three unanswered tries as the
Roosters ran out of steam in the heavy conditions. The win lifted
St. George into equal fifth position with Sydney City and North
Sydney in the 20-team league.
	   Canberra halfback Ricky Stuart inspired the Raiders to a 22-8
win over Parramatta on Sunday as the Raiders scored four tries to
remain firmly entrenched in the top 10.
	   Penrith put a dent in the hopes of another top 10 aspirant with
a 26-18 win over Canterbury.
	   In Sunday's other game, Adelaide all but finished Auckland's
finals chances with a 22-20 home win. Auckland now has to win all
of its remaining four games to make the finals.
	   On Saturday, Manly continued its march towards a berth in the
finals by beating Gold Coast 30-6. Led by a strong forward pack,
the Sea Eagles ran in six tries to one in an error-marred game.
	   Cronulla five-eighth Adam Dykes played a part in four of his
team's six tries to lead the Sharks to a 38-8 win over Western
Suburbs.
	   South Sydney dealt North Queensland's finals aspirations a major
blow when it stunned the Cowboys 22-16. North Sydney center Michael
Buettner enhanced his reputation as a mud-runner with a three-try
performance in the Bears' 32-6 win over Illawarra.
	   Premiership favorite Brisbane was lucky to escape with a 10-10
draw against Balmain. The Tigers almost won in the dying minutes
with two unsuccessful field goal attempts _ the second one, only 30
seconds from the end, hit the posts.
	   On Friday, Marcus Bai matched Buettner's performance by scoring
three tries as Melbourne beat league-leading Newcastle 32-16.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Andrew Mehrtens has been recalled
to the starting 15 for New Zealand's Bledisloe Cup and Tri Nations

open-side flanker Josh Kronfeld with two players, halfback Mark
Robinson and flanker Scott Robertson, added to the team's extended

Blacks' 13-3 Tri Nations loss to South Africa and Kronfeld's head
injury in the final moments of the match.
	   The New Zealand team: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Mark
Mayerhofler, Jonah Lomu, Walter Little, Andrew Mehrtens, Justin
Marshall or Ofisa Tonu'u, Taine Randell (captain), Mark Carter, Ian

North Korea holds parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Pledging ``boundless loyalty'' to
leader Kim Jong Il, North Koreans cast ballots Sunday in
parliamentary elections seen as a prelude to the leader's rise to
the president's office.
	   Since the 1994 death of his father Kim Il Sung, the 56-year-old
son has been running the reclusive communist country as the supreme
military commander and head of the ruling Workers' Party.
	   But he has yet to assume full formal power by taking over the
other title left vacant by his father _ president.
	   Kim Jong Il's assumption of the presidency will complete the
first hereditary power succession in a communist country. His
father had ruled North Korea with an iron-fist for nearly a
half-century.
	   The North's rubber-stamp Supreme People's Assembly has the
authority to elect the president as well as approve and settle the
government's budget.
	   Analysts said the single-house assembly is expected to elect Kim
Jong Il as president around Sept. 9, when the North celebrates the
50th anniversary of the founding of its government.
	   Analysts predicted that as in past elections, North Korea will
report nearly a 100 percent voter turnout and 100 percent voter
support of candidates backing Kim Jong Il's policies.
	   As of noon, four hours after voting began, 91.42 of the
registered voters had cast their ballots, the North's official
Korean Central News Agency said.
	   ``Experiencing the same glee that our people felt when they held
great leader Kim Il Sung in high esteem as head of state 50 years
ago, I cast my ballot for the supreme commander Kim Jong Il,'' the
KCNA quoted one voter as saying.
	   Analysts said the elections meant the declaration of the ``Kim
Jong Il era.'' They said, however, that Kim's expected takeover of
the presidency would not change the Marxist country's hard-line
policies.
	   ``Kim had, has and will continue to have absolute power in North
Korea. It would not much affect North Korean policies,'' said Kim
Kwang-in, an analyst at semiofficial Naewoe Press, a North Korean
media watcher.
	   Details of the elections, including the number of deputies to be
selected, have not been announced. In the last elections in 1990,
678 legislators were chosen.
	   Kim Jong Il was the lone candidate in constituency No. 666.
South Korean officials said the constituency is believed to be a
military district inside the capital, Pyongyang.
	   North Korean legislators sit for a five-year term. North Korea
was to have held parliamentary elections in 1995, but they were
canceled because of the death of Kim Il Sung. The country has since
been running without a legislative body.

Thai activists warn army not to promote massacre general
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai democracy activists have warned
the army not to promote a general who allegedly ordered troops to
fire on unarmed democracy demonstrators in 1992, saying it would
touch off street protests, local newspapers reported Sunday.
	   The general, Chainarong Noonpakdi, is among candidates being
considered to replace Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chetta
Thanajaro, who is to retire later this year.
	   Chainarong was the field commander in charge of troops who
opened fire on unarmed democracy protesters in Bangkok in May 1992,
killing more than 40 and wounding more than 100. More than 50 are
still missing.
	   Adul Khiewboriboon, chairman of the Relatives of the Victims of
May '92, said many people have not yet forgotten that it was
Chainarong's troops who murdered the demonstrators, Sunday's
Bangkok Post reported.
	   The demonstrators, mostly members of Bangkok's middle class,
were protesting the appointment of coup leader Gen. Suchinda
Kraprayoon as prime minister because he hadn't been elected.
	   Suchinda was forced to step down after the violence.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ More than 1,000 protesters marched to the
Indonesian consulate in Hong Kong Sunday to demand the apprehension
of looters in Indonesia and protection for the Southeast Asian
country's ethnic Chinese.
	   The demonstrators called on the government in Jakarta to stop
human rights abuses and sexual assaults targeting ethnic Chinese,
who often are scapegoats in Indonesia in times of unrest.
	   Marchers carried banners saying, ``Protect human rights. No
violence,'' and ``Punish rapists.''
	   ``Strongly condemn violence in Indonesia. Indonesian government
must stop the violence,'' the protesters chanted during a 15-minute
march from a public park to the consulate.
	   Deputy Consul General Suhadi Salam received the protesters'
petition demanding that President B.J. Habibie apprehend the
looters, curb further violence and protect the Chinese community.
	   Ethnic Chinese were targeted in unrest that wracked Indonesia in
May. The riots and protests culminated in the resignation of its
long-time president, Suharto. Women's groups say gangs committed at
least 168 rapes, and that most of the victims were ethnic Chinese
women and girls.
	   Chinese make up only a tiny fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
people, but some indigenous Indonesians resent their control of
much of the economy.
	   Police said there were 1,200 protesters, although the
organizers, the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese General Association and
the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong
_ a major grassroots party, claimed 3,000 people turned out.
	   Party chairman and lawmaker Tsang Yok-sing said the ethnic
Chinese fear more violence against them is possible next month when
Indonesia celebrates its independence day holiday.
	   The Chinese ``don't know when they'll have a safe home to go
back to. We demand that the Indonesian government take immediate
action to punish the looters and curb the violence,'' Tsang said.
	   ``I was very angry. They're trampling on our human rights,''
said a protester, H.Y. Lee, an Indonesian Chinese who moved to Hong
Kong in 1953. ``This is a country that wants to extinguish the
minority races.''
	   The Democrats, the territory's largest party, also planned an
evening candlelight vigil Sunday. The party's chairman, Martin Lee,
said earlier he had written to U.S. President Bill Clinton to
express concern. The legislature's house committee also agreed last
week to write to Habibie.
	   An unidentified person threw several raw eggs above the
consulate entrance, but protest organizers immediately stopped
further acts of vandalism.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ai Sugiyama won another singles match
Sunday, giving Japan an unbeatable 3-0 lead over South Korea in Fed
Cup regional tennis qualifying competition.
	   Sugiyama, ranked No. 17 on the WTA tour, beat South Korean ace
Kim Eun-ha 6-4, 7-5 on a clay court at Changchung in Seoul. She had
overpowered South Korea's Choi Ju-yeon 6-1, 6-1 in a first-day
singles match Saturday.
	   In Sunday's match, Kim went ahead 2-0 in the first set, but the
speedy Sugiyama rallied to take the set 6-4.
	   The two played to 5-5 in the second set before Sugiyama
prevailed with sharp serves and powerful strokes.
	   One singles and one doubles match remained, but their results
will not affect Japan's overall victory.

Japan, Russian agree to continue schedule of leaders' meetings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ This week's pending change in
Japanese leadership will not interfere with the schedule of
high-level meetings between Russia and Japan, foreign ministers of
the two countries agreed Sunday.
	   ``Both sides said the schedule previously agreed upon of
high-level meetings would continue,'' a Russian spokesman said
after a meeting between Keizo Obuchi, expected to become Japan's
prime minister on Thursday, and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   The two foreign ministers discussed neither recent nuclear tests
nor the Asian economic crisis, said Vladimir Rakhmanin, a Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman.
	   But Primakov passed to Obuchi the congratulations of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin on the Japanese foreign minister's election
last Friday to head his Liberal Democratic Party, a post that
almost guarantees his succession to the prime minister's position.
	   The Primakov meeting was the first discussion Obuchi held during
a whirlwind 12-hour visit to Manila for the annual Regional Forum
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and major powers.
	   Primakov and Obuchi discussed mostly foreign policy issues, said
Rakhmanin. But Primakov did express condolences over the death of a
Japanese United Nations observer last week in Tajikistan, a former
state in the Soviet Union, and said Russia would press for a full
investigation of the circumstances.

A decade later, abuses during Venezuela riots still unpunished
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos CAR101,106 &QL; 
 &UR; By BART JONES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Wolfgang Quintana was holding his
infant daughter in one arm and drinking a glass of lemonade with
the other when a bullet whizzed through an open window and pierced
his chest.
	   He stumbled to a stroller, put his daughter in it, then made his
way down to the home's second floor, where he fell to his knees and
collapsed.
	   ``I tried to cover the wound ... but there was too much blood,''
his widow, Iris Medina, recalls. ``It was like when you open a
water faucet.''
	   Nearly a decade after Quintana and hundreds of other people died
when Venezuelan authorities crushed widespread rioting over soaring
prices, most of the killings remain unsolved and hardly anyone has
been punished.
	   The 1989 riots ended when police and soldiers sprayed
mountainside slums with bullets to restore order. Human rights
groups charge security forces fired indiscriminately and say many
shooting victims were hauled off and buried unannounced in mass
graves.
	   In a Caracas cemetery, 65 suspected victims found in a mass
grave nearly two years after the unrest still lie anonymously in a
concrete mausoleum. Relatives of missing people contend authorities
have blocked identification of the bodies.
	   The government denies bodies were hidden. And it says security
forces fired in self-defense at snipers, guerrillas and other
groups taking advantage of the rioting. Other victims were killed
by merchants protecting their shops or by people settling
vendettas, it says.
	   The activists say the bloodshed was a flagrant example of how
security officers who commit human rights abuses in Venezuela often
get away with it.
	   A few police officers have served brief jail terms for actions
during the rioting. No soldiers or high-level officials have been
convicted.
	   ``It was really a massacre,'' said Liliana Ortega, a human
rights lawyer whose group, the Committee of Victims of 1989, is
taking its charges against the government to the Inter-American
Human Rights Court in Washington.
	   She said most of those killed when police moved in were unarmed
and many were inside their homes. Officially, the death toll was
277; human rights workers estimate 400 or more were killed. Fewer
than a half-dozen police officers and soldiers died, Ortega said.
	   Venezuelan officials acknowledge some abuses may have taken
place, but they say most victims were killed during armed
confrontations with security officers trying to restore order.
	   ``There is not a single piece of proof that shows there was a
state policy to kill and `disappear' people like happens in other
countries,'' said a government lawyer, Raul Arrieta.
	   The riots broke out Feb. 27, 1989, after an economic ``shock''
program implemented by newly elected President Carlos Andres Perez
sent bus fares and other prices soaring in this oil-exporting South
American nation.
	   Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to loot stores,
lugging away milk, flour, TVs, refrigerators, even sides of beef.
Police did little the first day; many officers even participated,
rights activists say.
	   Perez sent in the army, filling the streets with tanks,
personnel carriers and heavily armed soldiers. Two days later, he
told Venezuelans they could head back to work.
	   Yet soldiers and police repeatedly fired into slums during the
next several days, Ortega said. Quintana, for instance, a
20-year-old bookstore worker, was killed a day after the president
said order had been restored.
	   In November 1990, a judge investigating the unrest granted
permission to a team of forensic anthropologists from Argentina to
search an area of the Southern General Cemetery where activists
believed officials had dumped victims in a mass grave.
	   They soon started finding bodies, many of them mutilated and
stuffed in black plastic garbage bags. Three were identified as
riot victims and turned over to their families, Ortega said. The
rest were stored in the mausoleum without being identified.
	   Arrieta contends the bodies were of indigents or other people
buried there because no one claimed them.
	   By early 1991, the exhumations came to a halt, and the judge was
replaced.
	   The judge in charge since 1992, Raiza Diaz Fortoul, says the
investigation has stalled because the military, police and
relatives of victims alike haven't provided enough information.
	   Relatives say they want officials to reopen the mausoleum and to
keep looking for what they believe is at least one other mass
grave.
	   ``We've been in this struggle for nine years and justice still
has not been done,'' said Medina. ``But I know that at some point
it will be.''

Cambodia casino business thriving despite war and poverty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Despite continuing war and widespread
poverty, Cambodia's casino business is thriving as a haven for
gamblers from neighboring countries, local newspapers said Sunday.
	   Two casinos are operating and a third is expected to open in the
next few days.
	   Cambodia, which on Sunday was holding only its second election
in more than two decades, has suffered through civil war, invasions
and genocidal Marxist rule since the conflict in Vietnam spilled
over on to its soil in the 1970s.
	   Violence is commonplace in the country and its economy is in a
shambles, with infrastructure crumbling and little foreign
investment. Crime rates and general lawlessness are also high.
	   None of that seems to bother bettors from neighboring countries,
however.
	   The casinos on Cambodia's southern coast and in the west are
raking in millions of baht (hundreds of thousands of dollars) from
hundreds of gamblers each day from Thailand, Malaysia and
Singapore, the Bangkok Post said Sunday.
	   One medium-size casino in Cambodia's Pailin district, 355
kilometers (220 miles) northwest of Phnom Penh, attracts 200 to 300
gamblers on weekdays, and double that on weekends. Bets ranges from
50 to 30,000 baht (dlrs 1.25 to dlrs 7,050), the Post said.
	   The paper quoted one casino partner as saying the business has
helped create jobs for local people and generated much-needed
foreign capital for Cambodia.

Iida defeats Nicaraguan challenger Gamboa, keeps title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Japan's Satoshi Iida, taking command in
later rounds, beat bleeding Nicaraguan challenger Jurio Gamboa by a
unanimous decision Sunday and kept his World Boxing Association
super flyweight title.
	   There were no knockdowns in the 12-round fight before 8,000
spectators at Nagoya City Gymnasium in central Japan.
	   Judges Francisco Sandoval of Venezuela, Orlando Sam of Panama
and Lou Tabato of the United States all scored it 115-113 for Iida.
	   The 26-year-old Gamboa, the No. 1 WBA super flyweight contender,
kept pressing forward and attacking the 28-year-champion Iida with
sharp left hooks and uppercuts in the early rounds.
	   Gamboa often forced Iida into the corner and punished him with a
series of hard blows.
	   But in the third round, Gamboa suffered cuts below his right eye
from Iida's head butting. American referee Rafael Ramos penalized
Iida one point.
	   After the injury, Gamboa bled badly and apparently had trouble
seeing Iida's punches.
	   In the sixth, Iida stopped backpedaling and took command,
attacking Gamboa with a series of lefts and and rights.
	   Iida concentrated his attack on Gamboa's bleeding eye, but
couldn't land decisive blows.
	   Both fighters appeared tired in the late rounds and clinched
frequently.
	   ``Since Gamboa attacked me with strong punches, I kept my eyes
on Gamboa's punches until the last moment,'' said Iida.
	   It was Iida's 25th victory, including 11 knockouts, against one
defeat and one draw.
	   Gamboa suffered his third defeat against 23 victories, including
14 knockouts.
	   Both weighed 52.1 kilograms (115 pounds), the superflyweight
limit.

Khmer Rouge makes historical shift with vote in former stronghold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ A former Khmer Rouge chieftain and his
men completed a historical shift Sunday, voting in a multiparty
election _ something they once would have considered a capital
crime.
	   The thousands of former Khmer Rouge guerrillas and their
families living around this gem-rich former stronghold near the
border with Thailand mirrored the rest of their countrymen and
lined up early to cast ballots in parliamentary elections.
	   Most never had voted before.
	   ``This is the first time in my life that I've participated in
voting,'' said Ieng Sary, one of the leading figures of the
genocidal Khmer Rouge regime of the late 1970s. ``We believe that
the Cambodian people will draw on their own experiences, and based
on that will consolidate and rebuild the country.''
	   Just over 23 years ago, Ieng Sary, his brother-in-law, Pol Pot,
and their Khmer Rouge army defeated a U.S.-backed military regime
in the closing weeks of the Vietnam War.
	   Anyone associated with the old regime was executed. The cities
were emptied and their people marched into the countryside to labor
in Maoist-style rural communes. As many as 2 million people died
from overwork, starvation, illness and systematic executions.
	   Ieng Sary was deputy prime minister and foreign minister.
Historians hold him responsible for inviting home diplomats and
overseas Cambodians to rebuild the country. Most were murdered.
	   In 1979, an invasion by Vietnam's disciplined army toppled the
Khmer Rouge. Ieng Sary and the others fled into the countryside and
continued to wage guerrilla war against successive governments.
	   Ieng Sary usually topped most-wanted lists after Pol Pot. But in
1996, he did the unthinkable _ breaking with the seemingly
monolithic leadership and bringing some 10,000 guerrillas to peace.
	   It was the biggest blow the movement had suffered since the
Vietnamese invasion. This April, the last major stronghold of the
Khmer Rouge still at war, Anlong Veng, fell to the government.
	   Pol Pot, deposed by other hard-liners last year, died April 15
of a purported heart attack.
	   Ieng Sary and Pailin have prospered in the interim. Gems, timber
and close access to Thailand have made the town one of the richest
in Cambodia. A casino _ something once viewed by the communist
guerrillas as the ultimate in the Western decadence _ is scheduled
to open Monday.
	   Last week, Ieng Sary threw his electoral support behind Hun Sen,
leader of the Cambodian People's Party.
	   For years, Hun Sen was reviled by the ultranationalist
guerrillas as a puppet of Vietnam, Cambodia's historic enemy, but
he is the country's most powerful politician. Ieng Sary tacitly
supports him in exchange for being left alone to run Pailin, free
of fear from persistent international calls to bring him before a
tribunal for crimes against humanity.
	   ``My assessment is that there will be a coalition government,''
Ieng Sary said. ``The CPP will be No. 1, but it will not have a
two-thirds majority.''
	   In Cambodia's last election, in 1993, the Khmer Rouge remained a
deadly force and threatened to disrupt the polls. It was kept at
bay by 20,000 U.N. peacekeepers.
	   The few hundred still operating near the Thai border under the
leadership of one-legged general Ta Mok staged an attack July 17 on
an election convoy, killing two people, but have been quiet since.
	   Kim Eng, an assistant to the diehard faction's chief of staff,
told The Associated Press by telephone that the group had no plans
to launch an attack to disrupt the electoral process.
	   Army troops, however, were on high alert just in case.
	   Kim Eng claimed that any attack would be mounted by defectors
who want to switch sides again in anger over pressure to vote for
the CPP and Hun Sen.

Japan's Obuchi to promise economic boost during ASEAN meetings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Japan's soon-to-be prime minister
Keizo Obuchi said Sunday he will reassure the United States, Russia
and Asian countries of his country's commitment to revitalize the
economy during his whirlwind round of meetings Sunday.
	   On the flight from Tokyo to Manila for the Regional Forum of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Obuchi told reporters he
was aware of the concerns among Asian countries about the state of
Japan's economy, and would emphasize his pledge to action during
his discussions.
	   ``I want to communicate strongly my ideas for revitalizing the
domestic economy and making a contribution to Asia,'' Obuchi told
reporters on the plane.
	   However, in his first meeting, a 25-minute chat at the Manila
Hotel with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the subject
of the economy never came up, said Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Yevgeny Primakov. Japan and Russia are both grappling
with deep-seated economic and financial problems.
	   It was unlikely that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
would let her later meeting with Obuchi pass without talking about
economics. The United States has exerted heavy pressure on Japan to
offer big tax cuts and push tough reforms of its banking system to
boost its sick economy, the largest in Asia.
	   The U.S.-Japanese meeting was added to the schedule at the last
minute, after Obuchi, the foreign minister, was elected Friday as
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, a post that virtually
guarantees he will become prime minister this week.
	   Asked by reporters on the plane about his choice for finance
minister in the new administration, Obuchi said, ``This will be the
economic revitalization Cabinet, so of course I want someone
appropriate for that.''
	   He said someone who could grapple with the bad-debt problems
hanging over the financial sector in particular would be needed.
	   Obuchi has previously said he wants to carry out big permanent
tax cuts and put together a supplemental budget later this year.
	   The ASEAN foreign ministers were waiting to press Obuchi to
quickly fulfill his pledges. Southeast Asian nations, suffering
from a yearlong economic and financial crisis, are depending on
Japan, their biggest investor and aid provider, to pull Asia out of
the doldrums.
	   Japan must ``expedite the implementation of its economic
measures in support of the economic recovery of ASEAN countries,''
the ASEAN ministers said in a communique Saturday.
	   They also said, ``Japan's determination to strengthen its
financial system and to put its economy back on the path of
self-sustained and domestic demand-led growth is important to the
recovery of the Asian economies.''
	   Obuchi was also meeting separately Sunday with the foreign
ministers of China and South Korea, visiting Philippine President
Joseph Estrada, and attending an ASEAN ministers dinner.

Swans players celebrate in style
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Sydney veterans Paul Roos and Wayne
Schwass celebrated major Australian Football League milestones
Sunday as the Swans scored a 60-point Australian rules football win
over Brisbane.
	   Roos, who has played 350 AFL games, and Schwass (200) collected
54 possessions between them in the Swans' 22.17 (149) to 14.5 (89)
victory.
	   Roos became the seventh man in AFL history to reach the 350-game
mark, helping the Swans consolidate fourth place and move to just
one game off first place.
	   In other games Sunday, Essendon beat St. Kilda 14.6 (90) to 13.9
(87), putting Essendon back into the top eight with five rounds
remaining. And Richmond ended Geelong's finals chances with a 10.7
(67) to 8.10 (58) victory.
	   On Saturday, captain Wayne Carey kicked eight goals and four
behinds to lead North Melbourne past Melbourne 22.20 (152) to 13.9
(87).
	   Collingwood's finals hopes all but vanished after West Coast
recorded a 21-point victory over the Magpies. The Eagles led all
day and withstood a final-quarter comeback from Collingwood before
winning 13.8 (86) to 9.11 (65).
	   Carlton, behind 18-year-old Lance Whitnall's eight goals, beat
the Western Bulldogs 29.11 (185) to 15.15 (105).
	   A three-goal game from Port Adelaide midfielder Nathan Eagleton
helped his side gain a 21-point victory over Hawthorn. The
18.11.(119) to 15.8.(98) win kept the Power's slim finals hopes
alive.
	   On Friday, the Fremantle Dockers, leading by 23 points after the
first quarter, squeeked home by one point over favored Adelaide,
winning 14.14 (98) to 15.7 (97). (djp)

Coal mine strike threatens Sakhalin power supply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Authorities threatened Sunday to prosecute coal
miners striking on Russia's Sakhalin Island, warning that their
protest could lead to a total cutoff in the region's electricity
supply, a news agency reported.
	   The miners began their protest Saturday, blocking rail lines and
roadways used to transport coal to the island's power plant in the
city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. They are demanding eight months' of
unpaid wages.
	   In a letter to the miners signed Sunday, Vice Governor Ivan
Malakhov warned that power has already been reduced and unless new
supplies of coal arrive, the island may lose all electricity in
about three days, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   He said the blockades violate Russian labor law and authorities
were preparing to file charges, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Sakhalin protest began as protests fizzled elsewhere. Only
one group of miners, in the town of Osinniki, continues to block a
railway in the country's large Kuzbass coal region, ITAR-Tass
reported. Groups in four other cities withdrew their pickets about
a week ago.
	   A wave of coal miners protests began in May to demand back wages
and oppose moves to shut the unprofitable mines.
	   A group of miners from the northern mining region of Vorkuta
have been camped outside the government's main administration
building in Moscow since early June to draw attention to their
plight.

Singapore leader: Indonesian recovery will take at least 4-5 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's deputy prime minister expects
neighboring Indonesia to face a long, hard recovery from its worst
economic crisis in decades, according to a magazine interview
published in The Sunday Times newspaper.
	   Lee Hsien Loong said that ``perhaps Indonesia will pick up in
four or five years'' depending on domestic and regional
circumstances, such as whether governments will be able to make
difficult reforms and how people react to these changes.
	   ``But if the governments cannot do what is necessary, then we
are in for some period of uncertainty'' in Indonesia and throughout
the region, said Lee, who also heads Singapore's de facto central
bank.
	   The newspaper quoted from his interview with World Link
magazine, the official publication of the World Economic Forum, in
the upcoming July/August edition.
	   Indonesia has been hardest hit by Asia's financial and economic
crisis.
	   Its currency has fallen 70 percent in value over the past year,
while financial institutions and many businesses have become
insolvent.
	   Aid workers have warned recently that tens of millions of people
are becoming impoverished in the world's fourth most populous
country.
	   In May, widespread social unrest sparked by price increases for
basic commodities led to the resignation of Asia's longest ruling
leader _ former President Suharto _ and his replacement by B.J.
Habibie.
	   Earlier this month, Habibie called on Indonesia's 200 million
people to fast twice a week as rice supplies _ damaged by droughts
over the past year _ continue to dwindle.
	   The International Monetary Fund is organizing a dlrs 43 billion
bailout package for the country, but has tied the aid to economic
and financial reforms.

Former interior minister calls on Thai prime minister to resign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A former interior minister has called
on Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai to resign because he has
failed to solve the country's economic crisis, local newspapers
said Sunday.
	   Snoh Thienthong, secretary-general of the opposition New
Aspiration Party, said Chuan should act like a ``gentleman'' and
step aside the way his party leader, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, did
when he resigned as prime minister last November after failing to
turn the economy around, Sunday's Bangkok Post reported.
	   Chavalit's mismanagement has been widely blamed for the crisis.
Street protests broke out in Bangkok last October, with
middle-class workers demanding he step down.
	   Earlier this week, Chavalit called on Chuan's finance minister
to resign and criticized the prime minister for trying to revamp
the military.
	   In the past few months, Chavalit and his allies have disregarded
widespread calls for national unity in dealing with Thailand's
worst economic crisis in modern times and stepped up their attacks
on Chuan's government.
	   Snoh's call does not have widespread support. Although he was
one of the most powerful members of Chavalit's government, he was
also one of the most ridiculed.
	   As interior minister, he was derided by the press and opponents
for doing nothing to solve corruption, rampant drug problems and
widespread prostitution, and instead pushing to legalize cock
fighting and calling his opponents communists.
	   Snoh was countered by former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun,
who voiced his support in Sunday's papers for Chuan's government,
saying Thailand has been moving in the right direction for the past
eight months.
	   Anand, widely respected as an honest and capable prime minister,
said people cannot expect the crisis to be solved in a few months.
	   Chuan's handling of the economic crisis has also won praise from
the United States, the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund, which has led a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout of the
economy.
	   In addition, nearly 90 percent of the country's bankers polled
last week gave his administration their approval.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki has held
talks with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Eritrea's simmering
border dispute with Ethiopia, state-run Libyan television reported.
	   The visit on Saturday came after Afwerki arrived by plane in the
Libyan capital Tripoli, according to a broadcast on the television
that was monitored by the BBC in London.
	   The Egyptian Al-Ahram newspaper said Afwerki flew to Egypt, then
went by car to a Libyan town where he caught a flight to Tripoli.
	   U.N. sanctions ban air travel to Libya. They were imposed in
1992 to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet that killed 270 people.

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Japan's Satoshi Iida, taking command in
later rounds, beat bleeding Nicaraguan challenger Jurio Gamboa by a
unanimous decision Sunday and kept his World Boxing Association
super flyweight title.
	   There were no knockdowns in the 12-round fight before 8,000
spectators at Nagoya City Gymnasium in central Japan.
	   Judges Francisco Sandoval of Venezuela, Orlando Sam of Panama
and Lou Tabato of the United States all scored it 115-113 for Iida.
	   The 26-year-old Gamboa, the No. 1 WBA super flyweight contender,
kept pressing forward and attacking the 28-year-champion Iida with
sharp left hooks and uppercuts in the early rounds.
	   Gamboa often forced Iida into the corner and punished him with a
series of hard blows.
	   But in the third round, Gamboa suffered cuts below his right eye
from Iida's head butting. American referee Rafael Ramos penalized
Iida one point.
	   After the injury, Gamboa bled badly, affecting his fighting.
	   ``I couldn't see the champion because of bleeding from injuries
around my right eye,'' he said later. ``Iida is a good champion,
but I had the confidence to win. ... It is regrettable that I
couldn't beat him.''
	   In the sixth, Iida stopped backpedaling and took command,
attacking Gamboa with a series of lefts and and rights.
	   Iida concentrated his attack on Gamboa's bleeding eye, but
couldn't land decisive blows.
	   Both fighters appeared tired in the late rounds and clinched
frequently.
	   ``Since Gamboa attacked me with strong punches, I kept my eyes
on Gamboa's punches until the last moment,'' said Iida.
	   It was Iida's 25th victory, including 11 knockouts, against one
defeat and one draw.
	   Gamboa suffered his third defeat against 23 victories, including
14 knockouts.
	   Both weighed 52.1 kilograms (115 pounds), the superflyweight
limit.

Thousands of Megawati supporters rally peacefully in Indonesia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with planned rally being moved to Megawati's home,

<TEXT>
	   YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Several thousand supporters of
Indonesian opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri staged a noisy
but peaceful rally Sunday to commemorate the second anniversary of
a bloody 1996 crackdown against their party.
	   The demonstration was staged in Yogyakarta one day before
Megawati was due to hold her own commemoration in the capital,
Jakarta, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) to the west.
	   Originally, she had planned to conduct her rally in Jakarta's
main sports park.
	   However, police refused to give her permission on security
grounds. About 9,000 troops and police were put on alert despite
assurances from organizers that there would no trouble.
	   Wanting to avoid a confrontation with security forces, rally
organizers announced Sunday that a smaller gathering would go ahead
on the grounds of Megawati's south Jakarta home instead.
	   Megawati, who was ousted as head of the Indonesian Democratic
Party, has criticized the ban as contrary to government promises to
allow free speech.
	   Armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto has defended the ban, saying
that the mobilization of protesters in Jakarta could ``entail great
risks,'' the official Antara news agency reported.
	   Yogyakarta's rally proceeded without incident in a square
adjacent to the palace of the ancient city's sultan.
	   Hundreds of Megawati supporters later drove through the streets
on motorcycles and in cars, waving banners and flags and chanting
slogans.
	   There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
	   Two years ago, Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, gained wide popularity after she
criticized the autocratic policies of then President Suharto.
	   That led, however, to her ouster as party head in June 1996 by
pro-government rivals within the party.
	   Her supporters protested by occupying the party's Jakarta
headquarters. But on July 27, the military and police staged a
predawn raid on the building.
	   The assault triggered major riots in which at least five people
were killed and dozens of others were reported missing.
	   The political fortunes of Megawati and other opposition figures
have risen following Suharto's resignation in May after Indonesia
was rocked by more protests and riots amid the worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised to reform
the tightly-controlled political system and to hold free elections
next year.

	   KOMPONG CHAM, Cambodia (AP) _ Though he accuses strongman Hun
Sen of using intimidation and murder to ensure victory in Sunday's
elections, prominent dissident Sam Rainsy said the fact that so
many Cambodians cast ballots was cause for hope.
	   Voting in the central province of Kompong Cham, Sam Rainsy said
the vote proved that ``there is a will to bring about change in
Cambodia.''
	   But he added: ``It will be very sad if that will cannot be
translated into an honest election with an honest result.''
	   Sam Rainsy has called the elections a farce intended to
legitimize power seized by Hun Sen after he ousted Prince Norodom
Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a coup last year.
	   He has warned that Hun Sen could use the days after the ballots
are cast to manipulate the results.
	   Looking drawn after a month of heavy campaigning, in which he
drove from one side of the country to the other and delivered
speech after speech to enthusiastic supporters under the tropical
sun, Sam Rainsy glided through a crowd to the polling station.
	   ``I am very encouraged by the courage of the Cambodian people
and how enthusiastic they were, going early and in large numbers to
the polls,'' said Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister.
	   Sam Rainsy and Hun Sen's other main challenger, Ranariddh, were
chased into exile after the coup but allowed by Hun Sen to return
to contest the parliamentary elections. Hun Sen needs to to restore
his international legitimacy through the vote.
	   Conceding that the violence of the campaign flaws the election,
foreign countries and watchdog groups conceded Saturday they will
judge it by a lower standard but still see the polls as vital for
rebuilding a country traumatized by decades of war and the Khmer
Rouge genocide.
	   Rainsy criticized the decision: ``They think Cambodia deserves
only a second-class election because Cambodia is a Third World
country.''

Assad in Egypt to discuss Middle East peace prospects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad held talks
Sunday with Egypt's president on the troubled Middle East peace
process, especially Israel's recent decision to require a
referendum on returning the Golan Heights.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met Assad at the Alexandria
airport, and the two went together to the Ras el-Tin Palace for
their meeting.
	   Syria has expressed anger over the decision July 22 by Israel's
parliament to give preliminary approval to a bill requiring that a
referendum be held in Israel on any decision to withdraw from the
Golan Heights.
	   Israel captured the heights from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
War and later annexed them. Syria insists that the land must be
returned as a condition for peace with the Jewish state.
	   The requirement of a referendum was seen as a move that would
complicate any negotiations with Syria.
	   Negotiations between the two countries last we held in February
1996 and have not resumed since Israelis later that year elected
hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister.
	   Talks between Israel and the Palestinians also have become
deadlocked since Netanyahu's election.
	   Last week the two sides held their first high-level face-to-face
meetings in months at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, but there was no breakthrough.

Nakano wins Sumitomo Visa Taiheiyo; Hurst places third
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOTEMBA, Japan (AP) _ Aki Nakano surged ahead of overnight
leader Pat Hurst with a 5-under-par 67 Sunday and won by three
strokes in the Sumitomo Visa Taiheiyo Club Ladies.
	   Nakano's final round of seven birdies and two bogeys gave her an
8-under 208 total. Yuri Fudo moved into second place at 211 by
matching Nakano's 67, the day's best score.
	   Hurst, winner of this season's Nabisco Dinah Shore, the
equivalent of the men's Masters, struggled to a 74, three-putting
three holes, en route to 212.
	   She had started the final round three strokes ahead of Nakano.
	   The victory, Nakano's sixth overall but first since winning the
Nasu Ogawa Ladies in April 1996, was worth 10.8 million yen (dlrs
77,000) from a purse of 60 million yen (dlrs 428,000).
	   ``In order not to be forgotten, I have to shorten the interval
between victories,'' said the 35-year-old Nakano. She won her first
title in 1991 and added two in 1992 but then took three years
before her fourth career victory in 1995.
	   ``I'll try to play steadily in a consistent rhythm to be in
contention more often, hopefully starting next week,'' she said.
	   ``I knew Pat Hurst can easily shoot a round in the 60s once her
hot streak starts. I was lucky I could speed up my momentum with a
couple of birdies on the back nine ahead of her,'' Nakano added.
	   ``I wasn't hitting the ball right and I wasn't putting well
today,'' said Hurst, whose mother, Kiyoko, is a Japanese-American.
``I'll play better next time I'm competing in Japan.''
	   Mieko Nomura shot a 70 and was alone in third place at 214.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hoping for a fresh start toward
peace and stability, Cambodians swarmed into polling stations
Sunday to vote for new leadership and put an end to festering
tension following a bloody power struggle last year.
	   For the first time, former Khmer Rouge guerrillas took part in a
democratic vote.
	   Foreign election observers predicted a high turnout and said the
result could surprise strongman Hun Sen, widely accused of
murdering opponents and intimidating voters to ensure he wins the
first parliamentary elections since U.N.-organized polls in 1993.
	   Polling stations closed on schedule at 4 p.m. (1000 GMT), but in
Phnom Penh most had been empty since noon. So many people had
arrived early _ some at daybreak, waiting in lines hundreds of
people deep for the stations to open at 7 a.m. _ that the process
was mostly over by lunch.
	   Stephen Solarz, a former U.S. congressman leading an independent
American observation mission, said the tranquility could mask a
``devious manipulation that would affect the outcome.''
	   Ballot boxes were to be transported to 1,100 communal centers
and emptied for counting, but not all polling station officials
knew where to go. Counting was scheduled to begin Monday and
preliminary results announced later in the day.
	   Most of the communal authorities are under the control of Hun
Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party, and there were fears of
tampering.
	   Ballot box irregularities were reported by Asian observation
teams. The opposition Sam Rainsy Party reported several incidents,
ranging from verbal challenges of party workers at voting stations
to an explosion with injuries in Koh Kong province. The explosion
appeared to be a previously reported grenade attack against a party
official.
	   Voting at a school, Hun Sen kissed his ballot and rejected fears
he will call out the army if his party loses, saying he was
prepared to hand over power.
	   ``If my party loses, I'm ready to be a coconut vendor or a
fishermen,'' said Hun Sen, looking healthy after an emergency
appendectomy July 17. ``Today, one can see that the Cambodian
people have achieved victory.''
	   No party is expected to win a majority of the 122 National
Assembly seats at stake, making a coalition government likely. That
could mean either give-and-take power-sharing, or infighting and
turmoil as in the past.
	   The main challengers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed
by Hun Sen as co-prime minister last year in fighting that
terrorized Phnom Penh, and former Finance Minister Sam Rainsy cast
ballots in the central town of Kompong Cham.
	   An upbeat Ranariddh said the election represented a ``choice
between democracy and totalitarianism.''
	   Sam Rainsy, whose party has suffered the brunt of pre-election
killings, was more somber.
	   ``It can be a turning point,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``I hope it
will, but I have no illusion. At least it shows the Cambodian
people want to vote. We can be disappointed later at the result.''
	   Phnom Penh was calm. So apparently were the remote northern
jungles, where the army was on high alert to prevent diehard
remnants of the Khmer Rouge from preventing thousands of
ex-comrades who have made peace in recent years from voting.
	   ``This is the first time in my life that I've participated in
voting,'' Ieng Sary, foreign minister of the genocidal regime that
caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people between 1975 and
1979, said in his gem-rich fiefdom of Pailin. He supports Hun Sen.
	   Widely accused of crimes against humanity, Ieng Sary received a
pardon in exchange for leading his men to peace. Under the Khmer
Rouge regime, belief in multiparty elections would have meant
certain death.
	   In Phnom Penh, one of the first people to vote was Chan Somphon,
51, a farmer living at a Buddhist pagoda since a land mine tore off
his left leg. One in every 300 Cambodians has been killed or maimed
by the millions of mines buried during three decades of civil war.
	   Leaning on a wooden crutch, Chan Somphon chose from the 39
parties, dropped his ballot into a locked metal box and had his
finger dipped in purple ink, a precaution to prevent multiple
voting.
	   ``I want peace for Cambodia,'' said Chan Somphon who, like most
voters, refused to state his party preference. ``No more war. If
the vote is honest, we will have peace.''
	   In another neighborhood, hundreds of people waited in lines
snaking through a schoolyard as the process began. The affluent
dressed in their best clothes; the poor shielded their heads from
the sun with checkered scarves.
	   Hun Sen was also favored to win the 1993 vote, but lost. Despite
20,000 U.N. peacekeepers, he thwarted the result and forced the
winners, Ranariddh and his royalist FUNCINPEC party, to share power
under threat of civil war.

Assad in Egypt to discuss Middle East peace prospects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad held talks
Sunday with Egypt's president on the stagnating Middle East peace
process, especially on Israel's recent decision to require a
referendum on returning the Golan Heights.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met Assad at the Alexandria
airport, and the two went together to the Ras el-Tin Palace for
their meeting.
	   Syria has expressed anger over the July 22 decision by Israel's
parliament to give preliminary approval to a bill requiring that a
referendum be held in Israel on any decision to withdraw from the
strategic Golan Heights.
	   Israel captured the heights from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war and later annexed them. Syria insists that the land must be
returned as a condition for peace with the Jewish state.
	   The requirement of a referendum was seen as a move that would
complicate any negotiations with Syria.
	   Negotiations between the two countries last were held in
February 1996 and have not resumed since Israelis elected
hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister later that year.
	   Talks between Israel and the Palestinians also have become
deadlocked since Netanyahu's election.
	   Last week the two sides held their first high-level face-to-face
meetings in months at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, but there was no breakthrough.

Chinese grandmother sentenced to death for killing granddaughter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A grandmother angry that her daughter-in-law did
not give birth to a son has been sentenced to death by a Chinese
court for killing her granddaughter.
	   Lin Xinnu harbored a traditional Chinese preference for male
heirs, the Xinmin Evening News reported Saturday.
	   Ever since Kong Yahong gave birth to the girl, the 63-year-old
grandmother had been angry, finding every opportunity to argue with
her daughter-in-law, the newspaper said.
	   During one fight in March at their home on the outskirts of
southeastern Ningbo city, Lin grabbed the baby girl from Kong's
arms and threw her to the ground, splitting open the child's skull,
the newspaper added.
	   Ningbo's Intermediate People's Court recently ordered Lin put to
death for the murder. Her daughter, Chen Juye, was given a two-year
suspended jail term for harboring Lin before her arrest.
	   Traditionally in Chinese society, only males inherited property
and carried the family name. While the Communist Party sought to
end the bias after coming to power 49 years ago, its policy of
limiting most families to one child has fueled a suspected rise in
abortions, killings and abandonments of baby girls.
	   Chinese news reports have estimated that every year, births of
boys outnumber those of girls by more than 3.5 million. Although
family planning officials have acknowledged the imbalance, they
have not offered any explanation.

Labor Minister says 2,000 Thais laid off each day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's labor minister says an
average of 2,000 Thais a day have been losing their jobs in the
past month, local newspapers reported Sunday.
	   Labor Minister Trairong Suwankhiri has called for an emergency
meeting with business leaders to assess the situation and develop a
crisis-management plan, the newspaper The Nation said.
	   Trairong said the unemployment rate has risen dramatically in
the past few months as more factories close because of financial
turmoil. He provided no statistics, however.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic slump in modern
times. More than a million Thais have become unemployed since the
crisis began in July 1997.
	   In recent developments, 2,200 workers were left unemployed when
a computer parts factory closed, and 5,000 were laid off when Thai
Melon, one of the country's largest textile companies, shut down.
	   Last Friday, Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and its Thai subsidiary
closed one of two assembly plants, citing slumping sales because of
the economic crisis. They laid off another 600.
	   To cope with the rising number of labor disputes and lawsuits,
the Justice Ministry will open eight more branches of its Labor
Court throughout the country by Aug. 10, the Bangkok Post reported
Sunday.
	   The ministry currently has three branches outside of Bangkok.
	   According to Justice Minister Suthas Ngernmuen, 17,214 cases
were filed with the Central Labor Court last year. The number of
cases so far this year is 12,700, he said.
	   About 25,000 cases are expected to be filed this year, he said.

Indonesian farmers walk back on to land they claim was taken by

<TEXT>
	   BOGOR, Indonesia (AP) _ About 300 farmers on Sunday walked back
on to a cattle ranch operated by former President Suharto, saying
the land legally belongs to them.
	   They planted vegetables and other crops in small plots in an act
of defiance against the former autocratic leader, who resigned in
May after a wave of riots and protests.
	   Three earlier attempts by the farmers to take back the land in
recent weeks failed after security guards and police pushed them
off the ranch, near Bogor, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) southeast
of Jakarta.
	   However, there was no confrontation Sunday when the farmers and
their families dug up soil and planted seeds and seedlings on a
section of land on the ranch's outer edge.
	   Police officers took no action when they saw that the group,
which included women and children, had not invaded the main
fenced-off area of the ranch.
	   The villagers claim 450 hectares (1,110 acres) of Suharto's
700-hectare (1,730-acre) Tri-S Tapos ranch belongs to them.
	   The property sits in lush, hilly country and is considered one
of Indonesia's foremost cattle breeding and producing ranches.
	   The farmers said they were forced off their land in 1972 by
Suharto. They received little or no compensation, they said.
	   ``This is my land that was seized by Suharto,'' said Nawi bin
Saib, an 80-year-old farmer, who claimed he used to grow banana
trees on a half-hectare (1.2-acre) block now used to grow corn for
Suharto's cattle.
	   The farmers have complained to Indonesia's National Human Rights
Commission. Lawyers acting on their behalf say they plan to take
the former president to court.
	   Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years, has not commented on
the case.
	   However, the powerful armed forces have warned they will not
tolerate attempts to seize land or to loot.
	   Police complain that crime has risen since the authoritarian
Suharto quit amid the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Villagers in other parts of Indonesia have also tried to claim
back land used for golf courses and other developments.

Albanian politicians appeal to NATO, US to stop fighting; Serbs
</HEADLINE>
claim gains &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian politicians are
urging the Americans and Europeans to pressure the government to
call off a military offensive which appeared Sunday to be gaining
ground against separatist Albanian rebels.
	   Serb sources reported gains in their offensive, which began late
Friday on at least three fronts to clear Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters from major highways through rebellious Kosovo province.
	   It appeared the offensive was aimed in part at pressuring the
KLA into accepting moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to lead
the Albanian side in future talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on the province's future.
	   U.S. and European mediation has focused on bringing the two
sides to the table.
	   In a statement late Saturday, however, Rugova's Democratic
League of Kosovo warned instead that unless the fighting stopped,
it would increase ``the danger of total and bloody war'' in the
Serbian province, where Albanians form 90 percent of the
population.
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' Rugova's party said.
	   Although Rugova also backs independence, the Americans and
Europeans are promoting him as a leader of the Albanian side in
future talks because he opposes violence.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore autonomy, which he withdrew in
1989, but opposes independence.
	   On Saturday, both Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting
along the main road from the capital Pristina to Kosovo's
second-largest city Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west, and the
route between Pristina and Prizren, 65 kilometers (40 miles) to the
south.
	   The Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serb police were
also attacking in western Kosovo along the highway running parallel
to the border with Albania from which the rebels smuggle weapons.
	   According to the Albanians, police were also trying to advance
on Malisevo, main stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army about 50
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The Albanians reported at least one Albanian killed and another
wounded in the Malisevo fighting along with ``at least'' 10 Serb
policemen. The Albanians said at least seven other Albanians were
wounded in the fighting elsewhere in the province.
	   There was no casualty count from the Serbs, and the Albanian
claim could not be independently confirmed.
	   Although the scale of the fighting could not be determined, it
appeared to be the most widespread, coordinated series of attacks
since April, when government forces attacked rebel positions on
several fronts.
	   Sources close to the military, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the latest operations were designed to secure major
communications and transport links and to contain the KLA within
their rural strongholds.
	   The United States and the Europeans also oppose independence,
but hope a compromise can be worked out once the fighting stops.
Serbia and Montenegro together form the Yugoslav federation.
	   Hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands of others
have fled their homes, since long-standing tensions erupted into
violent clashes five months ago, following a crackdown by Serb-led
security forces.

Philippine police stage raid to remove defiant chief of freeport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with about 100 people injured in 6th graf; President
Estrada urging Gordon to leave in 12th graf; minor edits &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SUBIC BAY FREEPORT, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of police, using
tear gas, broke into the headquarters of Subic Bay Freeport before
dawn Sunday in an attempt to remove its dismissed chairman, who has
refused to step down.
	   The freeport, a former U.S. naval base, has been converted into
an industrial zone and become a showcase of Philippine economic
growth.
	   Police special forces fired tear gas and broke windows on the
second floor to enter the building, which hundreds of supporters of
former chairman Richard Gordon had barricaded for nearly a month.
	   Hundreds of other supporters gathered outside the building and
battled police with rocks and bottles. One fire truck was set
ablaze and two others were damaged. Police fired dozens of warning
shots into the air in an attempt to disperse the crowd.
	   Police were able to take control of the building several hours
after the raid began, but Gordon was not found inside, officials
said.
	   A British citizen from London, Bob Couttie, spokesman of the
freeport's chamber of commerce, was injured by Gordon' supporters
while watching the melee, witnesses and officials said. The chamber
had earlier decided to accept Gordon's replacement.
	   About 100 people were injured, including 22 policemen, two of
whom were hospitalized with stab wounds, local officials said.
	   ``It's a sad day for our country,'' an announcer on the SNN
television network said as it showed scenes of the fighting.
	   In a telephone interview with a radio station from an
undisclosed location, Gordon appealed to President Joseph Estrada
to withdraw the police.
	   ``You assaulted people who were sleeping,'' he said. ``You are
the ones with power. Use your power for the people, not against the
people.''
	   Estrada, who took office June 30, fired Gordon and appointed
longtime rival Felicito Payumo to take his place. Payumo has been
forced to set up a temporary office at the local airport.
	   Estrada described Gordon's pleas as ``political grandstanding''
and urged him to calmly give up his post to prevent more trouble.
	   Gordon insists his tenure has not ended. He was reappointed to
the post by former President Fidel Ramos early this year.
	   The decision by Estrada, a former actor and senator who opposed
U.S. bases in the Philippines, to replace Gordon appeared to be in
retaliation for efforts by Gordon's followers to prevent Estrada
from making an anti-bases movie at Subic in 1991.
	   Estrada also accused Gordon of trying to sabotage his
presidential campaign in Olongapo, the city adjacent to Subic.
	   Gordon won a restraining order against Payumo that lapsed last
week. A local court refused to extend the restraining order but did
not rule on whether Gordon's dismissal by Estrada was legal.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the lower court's decision
not to extend Gordon's stay meant that Estrada's order firing
Gordon and installing Payumo could be implemented immediately.
	   The chamber of commerce has said companies in the freeport,
which include Federal Express and Taiwanese computer maker Acer,
suffered losses totaling dlrs 3.5 million on July 1, when Gordon's
supporters temporarily barricaded all the freeport gates.

Auriol holds lead into final day of rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Didier Auriol of France holds a
slender lead going into Monday's final day of the Rally of New
Zealand following a water-logged day of competition Sunday.
	   While torrential rain caused the cancellation of two stages in
Northland, the 40-year-old Auriol reveled in the conditions to
establish a 30-second lead over his Spanish teammate, Carlos Sainz.
	   Auriol had started the day with a two-second lead over Sainz,
with world championship leader Colin McRae of Scotland in a Subaru
in third place.
	   The Frenchman, who earlier in the season was criticized for his
form, was quickest on five of the day's eight stages, including a
stage record at Ararua where he was 10 seconds quicker than anyone
else.
	   ``I chose my own tire cuts and we had a very good day today,
even though the rain made some of the stages very slippery and
difficult,'' Auriol said. ``It was important to maintain total
concentration so that we could build up as much of an advantage
before tomorrow's long stages.''
	   ``I'm quite confident and hope that the roads don't become too
dry.''
	   Sainz, who was fastest in the three stages Auriol didn't win,
switched to his teammate's tire choice and held a 14-second lead
over third-placed Richard Burns in a Mitsubishi.
	   McRae is nine seconds further back in fourth after a troubled
weekend in his Subaru. He clipped a spectator in the Maramarua
Forest on Saturday and suffered a series of problems Sunday with a
couple of spins and trouble with the steering and differential.
	   The injured man, who had strayed too close to the racing line,
was taken to hospital with leg injuries.
	   Of the 79 cars that started the rally, 62 are expected to start
the final day on Monday. (djp)

Controversial and colorful tycoon Roland ``Tiny'' Rowland dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Controversial and colorful tycoon Roland ``Tiny''
Rowland, who turned an unprofitable company in Rhodesia into a
multi-billion pound (dollar) international conglomerate, has died
at the age of 80, The Observer newspaper announced Sunday.
	   Rowland, who owned The Observer for 13 years until 1992, had
been suffering from skin cancer and died at the London Clinic, the
paper said.
	   The former head of Lonrho Plc built a personal fortune estimated
by the British media at 150 million pounds (dlrs 250 million),
owned homes in Britain and Mexico and a yacht in the Mediterranean
where he was vacationing when he became ill last week.
	   A spokesman for Lonrho Africa, a separate company which holds
Lonrho's trading interests in much of Africa, said he died Friday.
	   Calling himself a ``revolutionary capitalist,'' Rowland made his
reputation as an entrepreneur in Africa after World War II,
recognizing that independence was in the wind and that the
continent's newly independent countries would need industrial and
commercial know-how.
	   He started by buying two farms in Rhodesia, then branched into
mining and in 1963 became chief executive of the money-losing
London and Rhodesian Mining and Land Company.
	   During more than a quarter of a century, he turned Lonrho into a
multi-mix conglomerage with more than 1,000 subsidiaries in over 60
countries _ including manufacturing companies, hotels, motor
distribution businesses, printing and publishing enterprises,
textile plants, sugar estates, vineyards in France, oil, gas and
shipping interests, property and cattle.
	   ``He believed in the massive resources of Africa and believed
that a British company could make a lot of money by associating
itself with it,'' former Observer editor Donald Trelford told Sky
News. ``He got to know all the African leaders _ he was on close
personal terms. That was how he worked _ and he achieved it.''
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, who gave Rowland the
country's highest award, the Order of Good Hope Class III for his
contribution to peace and prosperity, told The Observer his death
was a shock.
	   ``He made an enormous contribution, not only to South Africa but
to the whole of Africa. He was a tremendous friend to the whole
country,'' Mandela was quoted as saying. ``We will remember him as
a long-standing friend in the struggle against apartheid.''
	   Kenneth Kaunda, former president of Zambia and another longtime
friend, was quoted as saying: ``He was a man full of compassion. He
had love for fellow human beings. We worked together to empower
Africans economically since the Seventies. He is a great loss to
us. A terrible loss.''
	   But Rowland's unconventional, individualistic style led to
prolonged legal and political battles as well as spectacular and
often brilliant business deals _ and he had enemies.
	   For the last 15 years, with only a brief respite, he waged a
bitter campaign against Mohamed Al Fayed, the Egyptian businessman
who defeated him in the takeover battle for the department store
chain House of Fraser which included the London landmark Harrods.
	   Rowland retired four years ago after being ousted as head of
Lonrho in a power struggle with Dieter Bock, his joint chief
executive. At the time, he said, ``I have survived ... He has his
debts and I have upwards of 200 million pounds (dlrs 330 million)
cash.''
	   Nicholas Morrell, the vice president of Lonrho, said: ``We've
been fighting Rowland for over five years now, but de mortius nil
nisi bonum _ of the dead speak nothing but good.''

Khmer Rouge remnants mount election day attack, kill 10

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Guerrillas from the last hard-line
faction of the murderous Khmer Rouge made good their pledge to
disrupt Cambodia's parliamentary elections Sunday, mounting an
attack on a government position in the remote northern jungles that
left 10 people dead.
	   Samraing Kimsan, spokesman for the National Election Committee
overseeing the voting, told a news conference that 30 to 40 heavily
armed guerrillas attacked a government army position at 5 a.m. near
Anlong Veng, the hard-line stronghold that fell to the army in
April when most of the war-weary rebels there made peace.
	   The government forces secured the area at around 9 a.m.,
Samraing Kimsan said, but the toll was heavy. One guerrilla was
killed and two were taken prisoner, two soldiers were killed and
two wounded, and seven civilians died. Three houses were burned.
	   There were no further immediate details. The attack was the
first since July 17, when a Khmer Rouge raiding party attacked a
convoy taking election materials to a remote area near Anlong Veng.
Two security personnel were killed and five wounded.
	   The hard-liners, estimated to number a few hundred guerrillas
under the one-legged general, Ta Mok, had vowed to disrupt the
election process. Government forces around Anlong Veng were put on
high alert through the election period.
	   Thousands of former Khmer Rouge guerrillas who have made peace
with the government over the past two years cast ballots Sunday,
the first time in their lives that many have ever voted. The
Maoist-inspired guerrillas once considered multiparty democracy a
capital crime.
	   The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians when it ruled between 1975 and 1979.

Minister accuses Turkey of phony furor over missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Cypriot minister on Sunday accused
Turkey of trying to wreck the island's economy by creating a furor
over the Greek Cypriots' planned purchase of Russian anti-aircraft
missiles.
	   ``Turkey's objective through the constant threats of the use of
force is to consolidate the occupation of (northern) Cyprus and to
strike at the strength of our economy,'' said Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou.
	   He was reacting to statements on Saturday by Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel, who reiterated warnings that Turkey would prevent
the planned deployment of the Russian S-300 missiles.
	   ``Their preparations for military intervention, their missiles,
their bases, their adventurous aspirations will only bring tears
and pain,'' Demirel said during a visit to the Turkish Cypriot
north of the island to mark the 24th anniversary of the Turkish
invasion.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since the 1974 invasion, which was sparked
by an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized
only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The Greek Cypriots plan to deploy the missiles later this year.
	   Purchase of the missiles has been criticized by the United
States and other Western governments, who argue that they will
raise tension in the region.
	   Several European countries have cautioned their nationals
against visiting the island. The Cyprus economy depends heavily on
tourism, which currently brings some 2.2 million visitors annually.
	   Omirou said the missiles are purely defensive and pose a threat
only to an aggressor.
	   He accused critics of the missile deployment of hypocrisy.
	   ``If they had protested just as strongly about Turkey's refusal
to respect U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding the
withdrawal of the Turkish occupation troops, possibly the Cyprus
problem would have been settled a long time ago,'' he said.

Nuclear tests to be criticized at Asia-major powers security talks
</HEADLINE>

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Social upheavals that could result
from a prolonged Asian economic crisis raised as much concern as
Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests when Asian foreign ministers met
Sunday to discuss regional security with counterparts from outside
powers.
	   The man of the hour was Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi,
soon to be prime minister, who flew to the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations Regional Forum with promises ``for revitalizing the
domestic economy and making a contribution to Asia.''
	   The best thing Japan can do for economic recovery in ASEAN ``is
to get its own financial house in order,'' said Thai Foreign
Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul. ``The financial disease started
in Japan in 1991-92, and they never cured it. So it cropped up
somewhere else, like malaria. We were the manifestation of that
disease.''
	   On his way to Manila for a 12-hour visit that includes meetings
with Philippine President Joseph Estrada, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, and the Russian and Chinese foreign ministers,
Obuchi told reporters he would choose a finance minister who could
grapple with the bad-debt problems hanging over Japan's financial
sector.
	   Japan's sluggish economy is at the center of the economic
meltdown in Asia, Albright said on her way to Manila. She scheduled
a quick dialogue with Obuchi after it became clear he would lead
the next government in Tokyo.
	   Senior U.S. officials, briefing reporters on her visit on the
condition of anonymity, said Albright would highlight ``the
important things Japan has to do to get its economy going. Such a
discussion doesn't have to be very long.''
	   The United States wants Japan to adopt a permanent tax cut to
stimulate its economy, deregulate and open its markets and reform
its banking system.
	   As for the other troubles of Asian nations, ``United States
policy toward the financial crisis is clear,'' Albright said. ``We
strongly urge reform, but we will also do all we can to help
countries that are being hurt by the crisis and that are committed
to reform.''
	   Australia and Canada joined the ASEAN foreign ministers in
criticizing India and Pakistan for their recent nuclear tests.
Australia said the Regional Forum should condemn the newest nuclear
states in a statement at the end of the meeting Monday.
	   But the ASEAN ministers have also said they will press long-term
nuclear powers such as the United States and Russia to set an
example with faster progress on disarmament.
	   ``At the same time as we condemn South Asia, we also want to
urge the U.S. and Russia to continue making progress on START,''
the nuclear arms reduction treaty, said Alexander Downer,
Australia's foreign minister.
	   ``The Indian and Pakistani tests have been a very serious
development for the region and for the world. It has led to a very
serious deterioration in the security environment of South Asia.''
	   ASEAN seeks to create a nuclear weapons free zone in Southeast
Asia, including a ban on ships carrying the arms through
international waters.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   They meet annually in the Regional Forum with Australia,
Cambodia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South
Korea, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Russia, and the United
States.
	   In addition, Britain and Germany are sending separate
representatives this year to participate in the Post-Ministerial
Conferences that take place Tuesday and Wednesday.

BT, AT and T form dlrs 10 billion global alliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Style on AT and T uses ampersand
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Telecommunications PLC and AT and T said
Sunday they will form a dlrs 10 billion alliance to take advantage
of the growing global telephone industry that is becoming
increasingly open to competition.
	   BT, the biggest British telephone company, reached the deal with
AT and T, the biggest U.S. carrier, after BT's earlier plan to
merge with MCI Communications Corp. was busted up by a higher offer
from rival WorldCom Inc.
	   The BT chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, and AT and T
president John D. Zeglis, were to outline their plans at a
midafternoon news conference.
	   ``The merging of our international assets to form this global
venture will enable BT and AT and T to deliver in a unique and
powerful way the seamless global services our multinational
customers need and want,'' Zeglis said in a statement.
	   The companies said their 50-50 venture, to be named later, will
be based in the eastern United States with some 5,000 employees. It
will be a free-standing company run by executives from both BT and
AT and T.
	   The BT chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, will be its first chairman.
	   The telephone giants estimated that the business will have dlrs
10 billion in revenues and operating profits of dlrs 1 billion in
the first year, which will improve earnings at each company ``from
day one.'' The companies predicted 15 percent annual growth after
that.
	   The companies initially plan capital expenditures of around dlrs
1 billion per year in the business.
	   The companies plan to bring in more partners in various local
markets and said they will be able to ``provide an outstanding
range of global services far greater than either BT or AT and T
could provide alone or with their current alliances.''
	   The venture will have three main areas of operation:
	   _A worldwide voice and data business that offers telephone
networks to multinational corporations and other big instituations.
	   _A global sales and service business that initially will target
corporate clients in the financial, oil and information technology
businesses.
	   _An international carrier services business that will develop
low-cost communications links around the world for both individual
and business customers.
	   Separately, BT and AT and T announced a deal to invest dlrs 1
billion, on a 50-50 basis, in U.S. businesses involved in high
technology and ``emerging communications markets.''
	   After losing its deal with MCI, the No. 2 U.S. long-distance
carrier, BT went straight to the top of the U.S. market in cutting
a deal with AT and T, which has been expanding agressively since
chairman C. Michael Armstrong took over last year.
	   BT's agreed deal to purchase MCI for dlrs 24 billion was outdone
by a dlrs 37 billion offer from WorldCom.
	   BT already had a global partnership with MCI, called Concert,
that BT plans to buy out as WorldCom buys MCI. The U.S. Federal
Communications Commission is expected to rule on the WorldCom
acquisition of MCI next month.
	   Concert offers global telephone networks _ including voice, data
and Internet services _ to corporate clients. AT and T will begin
selling Concert services in the United States under the name AT and
T Concert.

Iraq accuses neighbors of failing to hunt down criminals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq says that neighboring countries have
refused its requests for help in apprehending criminals, the
Al-Musawir newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The state-run weekly quoted Iraq's liaison with Interpol, Brig.
Saad al-Taai, as complaining about ``the poor cooperation'' he has
received from other Arab countries ``to preserve security and
pursue the outlaws.''
	   He did not name any of the suspects, but Iraq is known to have
sought help in tracking down opponents of the regime of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, many of whom have fled the country.
	   Iraq has accused some of stealing government money. And it
charges that they have joined Iraqi opposition groups abroad,
allegedly with backing from the U.S. government.
	   Al-Taai specifically mentioned Jordan, saying the country failed
to hand over an Iraqi suspect who was in Jordanian police custody
for at least five days. He did not name the Iraqi or say what crime
he was sought for.

Truck ban in Spanish Basque region causes 10-km tieup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAYONNE, France (AP) _ Hundreds of trucks created a 10-km
(6-mile) traffic jam Sunday on the main highway between France and
Spain's Basque region, which banned trucks during the Saint James
holiday, officials said.
	   Motorists were encouraged to cross into Spain on the
Mediterranean side near Perpignan to relieve the tieup that
resulted from the holiday Saturday, combined with the usual Sunday
ban on trucks in Spain's Basque region.
	   Highway signs in France urged trucks to park in rest areas to
wait out the ban, but police said a rumor on Citizens' Band radio
that the border remained open prompted hundreds of truckers to
drive on.
	   The traffic jam was compounded by holiday travelers along the
Atlantic coast, with more than 2,000 vehicles per hour expected on
the main A63 highway.
	   Spanish authorities were considering allowing freezer trucks
through the border, though other trucks would have to wait till 10
p.m. (2000 GMT) when restriction is lifted.
	   For the past two years, Spain's autonomous Basque goverment has
outlawed trucks on its highways on holidays including Santiago, or
Saint James. The city of Santiago de Compostel, in nearby Galicia
province, is a major Catholic pilgrimage site.

	   AITAPE, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ With helicopters buzzing
overhead to continue rescue and relief efforts, victims were
mourned and survivors comforted Sunday at church services on Papua
New Guinea's northwest coast, devastated by a deadly tsunami nine
days ago.
	   In Aitape, a village on the eastern verge of the tsunami
disaster zone and one of the central relief points, local people
and refugees attended a chapel service on the beach.
	   Standing barefoot beneath coconut palms and frangipani bushes as
waves broke softly on the beach, about 300 people heard a sermon
from Catholic missionary Father Austen Crapp.
	   The Christian service was preceded by a traditional welcome by
men, women and children dressed in grass skirts and headdresses
decorated with brightly colored feathers, who hammered on log
drums.
	   Large baskets of woven palm leaves left to collect donations of
clothes were filled by the service's end.
	   In Vanimo, a relief center at the other end of the disaster
zone, aid workers and members of military medical teams assisting
in the rescue effort joined victims, relatives and other residents
in a chapel service at a military field hospital.
	   Australian Army Father Glynn Murphy and Brother Benjamin Telu
led the service speaking in English and the most widely spoken
language in Papua New Guinea, Pidgin.
	   ``God gave us the earth,'' Fr. Murphy told the congregation.
``The earth does not know what it does, the earth simply is. The
earth gives us food from the land, timber to build our homes,
places for love and laughter.
	   ``But sometimes the earth moves and stretches. And a week or so
ago it stretched under the sea. It lifted the sea and the sea had
nowhere to go but where it went.
	   ``Nobody did anything wrong. It is just the way the earth is.''
	   The official death toll from the tsunami that struck northwest
Papua New Guinea on July 17 is 1,500 people. About 2,000 others are
still missing, however, Papua New Guinea government spokesman Chris
Hawkins said.
	   The government earlier had feared that up to 6,000 were missing.
That figure was lowered after it revised estimates of how many
people were in the area when the tsunami hit, and victim
identification and survivor interviews continued.
	   Many villagers fled from the coastline into the rugged interior,
making accurate counts of those killed or missing difficult.
	   More than 4,500 people have been left homeless by the three
massive waves that crushed villages along a 35-kilometer (22-mile)
stretch of coastline following a 7-magnitude earthquake.
	   Worst hit were villages around Sissano Lagoon, where about 8,000
people lived. Four villages built on exposed sand spits were washed
into the lagoon, which remains littered with bodies caught in
impenetrable mangroves.
	   Fearing disease by contamination, rescue workers have sealed off
the lagoon to allow bodies to decompose or be eaten by crocodiles,
wild dogs or pigs.
	   Hawkins said the exact number of deaths will probably never be
known.
	   ``We are relying on relatives to say where people lived and
whether they were there when the waves hit,'' Hawkins told The
Associated Press. ``In some cases, whole families were killed so we
will never know.''
	   More than 550 people are in critical condition in hospitals. The
most serious threat is infection caused by sand ground into open
wounds. Bacteria that thrive in the tropical conditions live in the
coral sand.
	   Australian army spokesman Capt. Mike Harris said Sunday that
patients from the two hospitals in Vanimo whose conditions have
stabilized would start to moving to hospitals in the nearest city,
Wewak.
	   Tsunami victim patients would gradually be transferred to the
Papua New Guinea national health system, Harris said.
	   Australian military doctors who had planned to be in the area
for up to 10 days are now expecting to stay two weeks or longer to
help stem the infection rate.
	   Harris said no survivors have been found alive for the past five
days.

In unusual move, Chechen president agrees to accept support from
</HEADLINE>
Moscow &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's embattled president, Aslan Maskhadov,
accepted an affirmation of support Sunday from Russia and agreed to
take part in an unusual meeting this week with his erstwhile
enemies.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has ordered Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to demonstrate support
for his government, even though the Chechen president led a
two-year war for independence from Russia.
	   Maskhadov still does not recognize Moscow's rule over his small,
Muslim republic. But he has been hit by a recent onslaught of
violence, culminating in an apparent assassination attempt Thursday
when a car bomb exploded under his motorcade, killing two of his
bodyguards.
	   The Chechen president has agreed to meet with Kiriyenko, and he
plans to use the time to press Moscow to pay out promised economic
support, Maskhadov spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev told the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   A time and location for the meeting has not been set.
	   Despite his fight for independence, Russia considers Maskhadov a
moderate who is trying to rein in lawlessness and keep his
government essentially secular. The Kremlin apparently fears that
if Maskhadov's government falls, a more radical leader could come
to power.
	   Maskhadov declared a state of emergency in Chechnya last month
after a group of gunmen tried to seize the state television center.
Conflicts between various armed gangs, sects and ethnic groups have
flared in recent weeks into open clashes.
	   ``I reaffirm once again that we support the government of
Chechnya and Aslan Maskhadov personally, and if anyone has any
doubts about that he is mistaken,'' Yeltsin said Saturday after
meeting Kiriyenko.
	   Several people have been arrested in connection with the car
bomb attack, ITAR-Tass reported Sunday, citing unidentified
sources.
	   However, the report suggested the suspects may only be
accomplices who permitted the bombers to watch the road from their
apartments. The report did not say how many may have been arrested
or provide other details.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hoping for a fresh start toward
peace and stability, Cambodians swarmed into polling stations
Sunday to vote for new leadership and put an end to festering
tension following a bloody power struggle last year. For the first
time, former Khmer Rouge guerrillas took part in a democratic vote.
Foreign election observers predicted a high turnout and said the
result could surprise strongman Hun Sen, widely accused of
murdering opponents and intimidating voters to ensure he wins the
first parliamentary elections since U.N.-organized polls in 1993.
(Cambodia-Election)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Hospitalized in critical condition, a troubled
loner has been charged with the murder of two police officers
inside the U.S. Capitol. The suspect's motives remained unknown as
investigators studied ``paranoid rantings'' from his past. Less
than 24 hours after the shooting, the Capitol was reopened to
tourists, many of whom left flowers on the rotunda steps in tribute
to the slain officers. A single FBI complaint filed Saturday in
U.S. District Court in Washington accuses Russell E. Weston Jr.,
41, from Rimini, Montana of killing both officers. An accompanying
affidavit said that when Weston was approached just inside an
entrance to the Capitol by officer Jacob J. Chestnut, ``Weston took
out a handgun he had in his possession, pointed it at Officer
Chestnut's head, and then fired it.'' (US-Capitol Shooting)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Ethnic Albanian politicians are urging
Americans and Europeans to pressure the government to call off a
military offensive that appeared to be gaining ground Sunday
against separatist Albanian rebels. Serb sources reported gains in
their offensive, which began late Friday on at least three fronts
to clear Kosovo Liberation Army fighters from major highways
through rebellious Kosovo province. It appeared the offensive was
aimed in part at pressuring the KLA into accepting moderate
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova as the leader of the ethnic Albanian
side in future talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on
the province's future. (Yugoslavia-Kosovo)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Social upheavals that could result
from a prolonged Asian economic crisis raised as much concern as
Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests when Asian foreign ministers met
Sunday to discuss regional security with counterparts from outside
powers. The man of the hour was Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi, soon to be prime minister, who flew to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum with promises ``for
revitalizing the domestic economy and making a contribution to
Asia.'' The best thing Japan can do for economic recovery in ASEAN
``is to get its own financial house in order,'' said Thai Foreign
Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul. (ASEAN)
	   AITAPE, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ With helicopters buzzing
overhead to continue rescue and relief efforts, victims were
mourned and survivors comforted Sunday at church services on Papua
New Guinea's northwest coast, devastated by a deadly tsunami nine
days ago. In Aitape, a village on the eastern verge of the tsunami
disaster zone and one of the central relief points, local people
and refugees attended a chapel service on the beach. In Vanimo, a
relief center at the other end of the disaster zone, aid workers
and members of military medical teams assisting in the rescue
effort joined victims, relatives and other residents in a chapel
service at a military field hospital. (Papua New Guinea-Tsunami)

Germany's Greens try to win back voters by steering toward center
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ After shooting themselves in the foot with
unpopular proposals like tripling the price of gasoline and
imposing speed limits on the autobahns, Germany's Greens sought
Sunday to moderate their image to win back voters and hold onto
their seats in parliament.
	   Pro-environment policies aren't enough to win voters anymore,
party leader Gunda Roestel said in Focus newsmagazine. ``So we have
to concentrate the economic policies on the middle-class.''
	   The Greens also announced that, once in power, they would not
seek to repeal the 1993 tightening of Germany's asylum laws, which
they strongly opposed at the time.
	   Right-wing parties have been winning support this election year
with calls for a tougher line on refugees and would-be immigrants.
	   Berlin's interior minister, Joerg Schoenbohm, said Sunday that
reducing the influx of foreigners to Germany was the most important
political task for after the election. Schoenbohm belongs to
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
	   Social Democrat chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder, who is
leading Kohl in the polls just nine weeks before the Sept. 27
election, has named the Greens as his likely coalition partner if
they win.
	   But Schroeder, who has been trying to pull his own usually
leftist party toward the political center, has already rejected
some of the stances taken by Greens traditionalists.
	   Surveys show those proposals _ such as raising energy taxes and
withdrawing from NATO _ have also hurt the Greens with voters.
Their support has sunk from around 10 percent this spring to about
6 percent in polls released Saturday.
	   In Germany, a party must receive at least 5 percent of the vote
to enter parliament.
	   Roestel told Focus that the Greens needed to court the political
middle too if it wanted to hold on to its seats.
	   ``We want to reach the people in the middle of society with our
concepts for tax reform, securing pensions and promoting jobs and
the economy,'' she said.
	   Her co-chairman, Juergen Trittin, told the ICE-press newspaper
that the first goals of his party if it wins power would be to form
a new job-creation alliance with business and labor, and to raise
the grants provided to families with children.
	   Other Greens leaders said the party would accept the 1993
changes in Germany's liberal asylum laws and would support an
immigration law regulating the number of foreigners allowed in to
Germany.

North Koreans elect a new parliament

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kim's election to parliament, details; ADDS

 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In a likely prelude to leader Kim Jong
Il's rise to the president's office, North Koreans elected him and
some 670 others to the country's one-chamber parliament Sunday.
	   Less than an hour after the voting ended, the North's official
Korean Central News Agency announced the election of the
56-year-old Kim to the Supreme People's Assembly, the country's
rubber-stamp legislature.
	   Since the 1994 death of his father Kim Il Sung, the 56-year-old
son has been running the reclusive communist country as the supreme
military commander and head of the ruling Workers' Party.
	   But he has yet to assume full formal power by taking over the
other title left vacant by his father _ president.
	   Kim Jong Il's assumption of the presidency will complete the
first hereditary power succession in a communist country. His
father had ruled North Korea with an iron-fist for nearly a
half-century.
	   The North's parliament has the authority to elect the president
as well as approve and settle the government's budget.
	   Analysts said the assembly is expected to elect Kim Jong Il as
president around Sept. 9, when the North celebrates the 50th
anniversary of the founding of its government.
	   Kim Jong Il was the lone candidate in constituency No. 666.
South Korean officials said the constituency is believed to be a
military district inside the capital, Pyongyang.
	   KCNA said all officers and men in the constituency voted for the
leader.
	   ``The servicemen put voting cards bearing the august name of the
supreme commander into the ballot boxes, reflecting the unanimous
desire and loyalty of all the serviceman and people of the
country,'' it added.
	   After casting their ballots, the voters shouted wishes for Kim's
longevity and danced and sang songs in a festive mood, it said.
	   Analysts predicted that as in past elections, North Korea will
report nearly a 100 percent voter turnout and 100 percent voter
support of candidates backing Kim Jong Il's policies.
	   As of 2 p.m., four hours before the voting ended, 98.87 percent
of the registered voters had cast their ballots, KCNA said.
	   It said ``mobile ballot boxes'' were used for voters unable to
go to polling stations due to old age, disease or other unavoidable
reasons.
	   Even before the polling stations closed, KCNA carried a lengthy
report on whom the nation's top leaders, including Vice President
Ri Jong Ok and Foreign Minister Kim Yong Nam, voted for.
	   Only one candidate is allowed in each North Korean constituency,
and voters are told to mark ``X'' on their ballot sheets only when
they oppose their candidates, Seoul officials said.
	   ``Experiencing the same glee that our people felt when they held
great leader Kim Il Sung in high esteem as head of state 50 years
ago, I cast my ballot for the supreme commander Kim Jong Il,'' the
KCNA quoted one voter as saying.
	   Analysts said the elections meant the declaration of the ``Kim
Jong Il era.'' They said, however, that Kim's expected takeover of
the presidency would not change the Marxist country's hard-line
policies.
	   ``Kim had, has and will continue to have absolute power in North
Korea. It would not much affect North Korean policies,'' said Kim
Kwang-in, an analyst at semiofficial Naewoe Press, a North Korean
media watcher.
	   Details of the elections, including the exact number of deputies
to be elected, were not announced. In the last elections in 1990,
678 legislators were chosen.
	   North Korean legislators sit for a five-year term. North Korea
was to have held parliamentary elections in 1995, but they were
canceled because of the death of Kim Il Sung. The country has since
been running without a legislative body.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Guerrillas from the remnants of the
murderous Khmer Rouge made good their pledge to tarnish Cambodia's
elections Sunday, mounting an attack on a government position in
the remote northern jungles that left 10 people dead.
	   The attack was an isolated, last-ditch spoiling tactic as
millions of Cambodians voted in relative peace nationwide for a new
parliament. Among the voters were thousands of former Khmer Rouge
guerrillas who have made peace since 1996 and were casting the
first ballots in their lives.
	   Samraing Kimsan, spokesman for the National Election Committee
overseeing the voting, told a news conference that 30 to 40 heavily
armed guerrillas attacked a government army position at 5 a.m. at
O'Kong Bich, 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Anlong Veng, the
hard-line stronghold that fell to the army in April when most of
the war-weary rebels there made peace.
	   The government forces secured the area at around 9 a.m.,
Samraing Kimsan said, but the toll was heavy. One guerrilla was
killed and two were taken prisoner, two soldiers were killed and
two wounded, and seven civilians died. Three houses were burned.
	   ``The incident did not take place in a polling area,'' Samraing
Kimsan said, though other details were sketchy. ``All the polling
stations are still functioning.''
	   Defense Minister Tea Banh identified the attackers as guerrillas
from the hard-line faction still fighting under the command of
their one-legged general, Ta Mok. But Samraing Kimsan said it was
unclear whether they were hard-liners or recent defectors having
second thoughts.
	   The attack was the first since July 17, when a raiding party
attacked a convoy taking election materials to a remote area near
Anlong Veng. Two security personnel were killed and five wounded.
The government vowed to keep all 11 polling stations in the area
open.
	   The hard-liners, estimated to number a few hundred guerrillas,
had vowed to disrupt the election process. Government forces around
Anlong Veng were put on high alert through the election period.
	   Thousands of former Khmer Rouge guerrillas who have made peace
with the government over the past two years cast ballots Sunday, an
action seen by strongman Hun Sen as a step toward national peace
and reconciliation. The Maoist guerrillas once considered
multiparty democracy a capital crime.
	   The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians when it ruled between 1975 and 1979. It was toppled by
an invasion from Vietnam, but waged guerrilla war against
successive governments.
	   In the 1993 elections, when the Khmer Rouge remained a serious
fighting force, some 20,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops were sent to
Cambodia for security.
	   Kim Eng, an assistant to the Ta Mok faction's chief of staff,
told The Associated Press by telephone earlier Sunday that no
attacks were being mounted by his men, suggesting any raids should
be blamed on disgruntled defectors upset over pressure to vote for
Hun Sen.

Vacationing pope jokes with crowd but sounds tired
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Sounding at times tired but in
good spirits, a vacationing Pope John Paul II joked with pilgrims
Sunday and offered comfort to those who feel alone when others go
on summer holiday.
	   After returning on Tuesday from the Italian Alps, where he had a
13-day vacation, John Paul is spending a few weeks in his summer
retreat in Castel Gandolfo, a lakeside hilltown southeast of Rome.
	   John Paul sounded tired as he slowly read a speech to the small
crowd of pilgrims and tourists gathered in the courtyard of the
papal palace here for the traditional Sunday noon blessing.
	   But he pepped up afterward as he bantered in several languages,
including Spanish, Italian and his native Polish, with the public.
	   ``Done? Done? Done? Can we go on?'' the pope asked jokingly
after a group of youths greeted him by singing verse after verse of
a song.
	   The 78-year-old pontiff, whose health setbacks over the past few
years have slowed him down considerably, took a moment to recall
the ``sick, elderly and all those who feel ever more the
difficulties of solitude during summer time.''
	   ``I hope they can find people who will be near them, and I wish
all those who have the opportunity to go on vacation a period of
deserved and serene rest,'' the pope added.
	   In the more intimate setting of the summer retreat compared to
the vast space of St. Peter's Square, John Paul seemed content to
linger. He spent 30 minutes with the crowd, about double the time
he usually devotes to his Sunday appearance when in Vatican City.

Armed group kills 15 in first massacre during U.N. mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ An armed group killed 15 people
overnight in a western town in the Moroccan border, hospital
sources said Sunday, in the first massacre since a U.N.
fact-finding mission arrived to investigate a Muslim insurgency.
	   The group attacked the village near the border town of Tlemcen
on Saturday night, stabbing or slashing to death 15 people. The
attackers shot and wounded two other residents before fleeing into
the night, witnesses said by telephone.
	   There was no claim of responsibility, but suspicion fell on
Muslim militants waging a 6 1/2-year-old struggle to topple the
military-backed government that canceled January 1992 elections the
Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in the insurgency. While the
Salvation Front has condemned massacres, the Armed Islamic Group
has been linked to the slaughter of hundreds of villagers in recent
months.
	   The wave of killings prompted the visit by a six-member U.N.
panel, led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares. The mission
arrived Wednesday for what was expected to be a two-week visit.
	   So far, the panel had yet to visit massacre sites, and the
government was not expected to allow the group to meet with the
Salvation Front, banned in 1992.
	   On Friday, an Algerian human rights leader told the mission that
security forces could be responsible for the disappearances of as
many as 18,000 people since 1994.
	   The mission, which is to report back to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, is looking into allegations the government of the
petroleum-rich North African nation had at least a passive role in
the massacres.

Fighting breaks out after political rally in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of fighting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of supporters of rival
political parties clashed in a street brawl after a rally Sunday,
police and witnesses said.
	   Several motorcycles and cars were set afire or damaged when
opposing mobs attacked the offices of each others' parties.
	   There were no reports of injuries or arrests, police said.
	   Earlier, several thousand supporters of opposition figure
Megawati Sukarnoputri staged a noisy but peaceful rally to
commemorate the second anniversary of a bloody 1996 crackdown
against their Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI.
	   Violence broke out after they took to the streets in a convoy of
cars and motorcycles, only to be challenged by members of the rival
Muslim-oriented United Development Party, or PPP.
	   Police said mobs threw rocks. One group tried to set the PDI's
office afire as others attacked the PPP's building across the
street.
	   The trouble in Yogyakarta flared one day before Megawati was due
to hold her own commemoration of the 1996 crackdown in the capital,
Jakarta, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) to the west.
	   Originally, she had planned to conduct her rally in Jakarta's
main sports park.
	   However, police refused to give her permission on security
grounds. About 9,000 troops and police were put on alert despite
assurances from organizers that there would no trouble.
	   Wanting to avoid a confrontation with security forces, rally
organizers announced Sunday that a smaller gathering would go ahead
in the grounds of Megawati's south Jakarta home instead.
	   Megawati has criticized the ban as contrary to government
promises to allow free speech.
	   Armed Forces chief Gen. Wiranto has defended the ban, saying
that the mobilization of protesters in Jakarta could ``entail great
risks,'' the official Antara news agency reported.
	   Two years ago, Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, gained wide popularity after she
criticized the autocratic policies of then President Suharto.
	   That led, however, to her ouster as PDI head in June 1996 by
pro-government rivals within the party.
	   Her supporters protested by occupying the party's Jakarta
headquarters. But on July 27, the military and police staged a
predawn raid on the building.
	   The assault triggered major riots in which at least five people
were killed and dozens of others were reported missing.
	   The political fortunes of Megawati and other opposition figures
have risen following the resignation of Suharto in May after
Indonesia was rocked by more protests and riots amid the worst
economic crisis in 30 years.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised to reform
the tightly controlled political system and to hold free elections
next year.

Albanian politicians appeal to NATO, US to stop fighting; Serbs
</HEADLINE>
claim gains &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Separatist politicians have urged
Western powers to pressure Yugoslavia to call off a military
offensive that appeared to be gaining ground Sunday against ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   Serb sources reported gains in their efforts to clear Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters from major highways throughout the Kosovo
province.
	   The offensive, which began late Friday on at least three fronts,
appeared aimed in part at pressuring the KLA into accepting
moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova as the ethnic Albanian
negotiator in possible talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is part of the Yugoslav
federation. About 90 percent of the 2 million people living in its
Kosovo province are ethnic Albanian.
	   U.S. and European mediation has focused on bringing the
government and the ethnic Albanians to the table.
	   However, Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo said Saturday that
unless the fighting stopped, ``the danger of total and bloody war''
in the Serbian province would increase.
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' Rugova's party said in a
statement.
	   Although Rugova also backs independence, which Western powers
oppose, the United States and Europe have been promoting him as a
leader of the ethnic Albanian side in future talks because he
opposes violence.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore autonomy, which he withdrew in
1989, but opposes independence.
	   Hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands of others
have fled their homes, since long-standing tensions erupted into
violent clashes five months ago.
	   On Saturday, both Serb and Albanian sources reported fighting
along the main road from the capital Pristina to Kosovo's
second-largest city Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west, and the
route between Pristina and Prizren, 65 kilometers (40 miles) to the
south.
	   The Albanian Kosovo Information Center said Serb police were
also attacking in western Kosovo along the highway running parallel
to the border with Albania from which the rebels smuggle weapons.
	   According to the Albanians, police were also trying to advance
on Malisevo, main stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army about 50
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   The Albanians reported at least one Albanian killed and another
wounded in the Malisevo fighting along with ``at least'' 10 Serb
policemen. The Albanians said at least seven other Albanians were
wounded in the fighting elsewhere in the province.
	   There was no casualty count from the Serbs, and the Albanian
claim could not be independently confirmed.
	   Although the scale of the fighting could not be determined, it
appeared to be the most widespread, coordinated series of attacks
since April, when government forces attacked rebel positions on
several fronts.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British Telecommunications PLC and AT and T said
Sunday they will form a dlrs 10 billion alliance to take advantage
of the growing global telephone industry that is becoming
increasingly open to competition.
	   BT, the biggest British telephone company, reached the deal with
AT and T, the biggest U.S. carrier, after BT's earlier plan to
merge with MCI Communications Corp. was busted up by a higher offer
from rival WorldCom Inc.
	   The BT chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, and AT and T
president John D. Zeglis, were to outline their plans at a
midafternoon news conference.
	   ``The merging of our international assets to form this global
venture will enable BT and AT and T to deliver in a unique and
powerful way the seamless global services our multinational
customers need and want,'' Zeglis said in a statement.
	   The companies said their 50-50 venture, to be named later, will
be based in the eastern United States with some 5,000 employees. It
will be a free-standing company run by executives from both BT and
AT and T.
	   The BT chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, will be its first chairman.
	   The telephone giants estimated that the business will have dlrs
10 billion in revenues and operating profits of dlrs 1 billion in
the first year, which will improve earnings at each company ``from
day one.'' The companies predicted 15 percent annual growth after
that.
	   The companies initially plan capital expenditures of around dlrs
1 billion per year in the business.
	   The companies plan to bring in more partners in various local
markets and
	   said they will be able to ``provide an outstanding range of
global services far greater than either BT or AT and T could
provide alone or with their current alliances.''
	   The venture will have three main areas of operation:
	   _A worldwide voice and data business that offers telephone
networks to multinational corporations and other big instituations.
	   _A global sales and service business that initially will target
corporate
	   clients in the financial, oil and information technology
businesses.
	   _An international carrier services business that will develop
low-cost communications links around the world for both individual
and business customers.
	   Separately, BT and AT and T announced a deal to invest dlrs 1
billion, on a 50-50 basis, in U.S. businesses involved in high
technology and ``emerging communications markets.''
	   After losing its deal with MCI, the No. 2 U.S. long-distance
carrier, BT went straight to the top of the U.S. market in cutting
a deal with AT and T, which has been expanding agressively since
chairman C. Michael Armstrong took over last year.
	   AT and T agreed in June to a dlrs 32 billion merger with U.S.
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., and just last week closed a
dlrs 11.3 billion takeover of Teleport Communications Group.

No. 2 Georgian leader resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
accepted the resignation of the country's No. 2 leader on Sunday, a
move apparently designed to clear the decks for a complete Cabinet
changeover.
	   State Minister Niko Lekishvili, who was second to Shevardnadze
in the government hierarchy, submitted his resignation and the
president accepted it, presidential spokesman Maya Audauri said.
	   Audauri declined to provide a reason for the move. However, in
recent days Lekishvili has been urging the entire Cabinet to resign
so that Shevardnadze can name an entirely new administration to
tackle Georgia's deep problems.
	   Lekishvili told the Interfax news agency that the rest of the
Cabinet will submit their resignations on Monday.
	   Georgia suffers from many of the same economic woes as other
former Soviet republics, plus it is battling separatists in the
Black Sea province of Abkhazia.

Olympic chief Samaranch says doping list must be cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The actual list of banned doping products
must be slashed and substances that don't damage an athlete's
health should not be prohibited, Olympic chief Juan Antonio
Samaranch said in an interview with a Spanish paper published
Sunday.
	   For the International Olympic Committee chairman, the recent
scandal involving the Festina team in the Tour de France is ``a
tough blow for cycling and for all sports,'' he told El Mundo
newspaper.
	   ``But the ones to blame are not the athletes but those around
them,'' he said. ``Doping demands an exact definition...and I have
been asking for it for years.''
	   He denied that the IOC has considered legalizing doping but
argued that ``the actual list of (banned) products must be reduced
drastically.
	   ``Doping (now) is everything that, firstly, is harmful to an
athlete's health and, secondly, artificially augments his
performance,'' Samaranch said.
	   ``If it's just the second case, for me that's not doping. If
it's the first case, it is,'' he added.
	   As for the immediate future, he said he didn't think blood
tests, instead of urine ones, would be a solution.
	   Samaranch insisted that although Tour de France episode was
particularly embarrassing, the overall situation was fairly
healthy.
	   ``For example, in the World Cup there were more than 60 games
and nearly 300 doping controls carried out, but not one player
tested positive,'' he told the paper.
	   The Festina cycling team, long ranked as one of the world's
best, was kicked out of the Tour de France after the team's
director admitted the team had supplied banned substances with
medical supervision to improve performances.
	   Last week saw the scandal widening when it was reported that
customs officials found the banned drug EPO in a car of officials
from the Dutch team TVM in March.
	   Samaranch denied the that the IOC was in a position to impose a
change and said it needed the collaboration of all. A major turning
point for the Olympics, he said, was in the Seoul Games in 1988
when top athlete Ben Johnson was suspended.
	   ''Some said it was a bad day for sport. We said the opposite,''
Samaranch told El Mundo. ``And since then we have seen that we are
not alone in the struggle. We have been joined by federations and
sports groups of all sorts and, as the Tour showed, even by
governments.''

Mandela and wife drop in on Stevie Wonder concert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ One week into their marriage
and President Nelson Mandela and his wife are already publicly
feuding _ in fun, of course,
	   The kidding started when Mandela publicly thanked his
grandchildren _ including a 6-month-old child _ for attending a
fund-raising concert Saturday that included singer Stevie Wonder.
	   Before he could finish his onstage thank you, his bride, Graca
Machel, interrupted him.
	   ``(Thank) the children, too, not only the grandchildren,'' she
said, according to APTV footage.
	   Mandela laughed and insisted he had said it right.
	   ``Well my wife here is very careful,'' he said.
	   The concert concluded the round of celebrations surrounding
Mandela's 80th birthday, which fell on July 18. He married Machel,
51, on that day.
	   Fresh off a flight from Brazil, where he and Machel spent their
honeymoon on a state visit, Mandela donned a fur hat and heavy coat
to attend the open-air winter concert.
	   He danced onstage with his family and Wonder, who, along with
American musician Kenny Lattimore, sang a special song composed for
Mandela.
	   Wonder's song ``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' had been
banned in South Africa during apartheid because the singer
dedicated his Grammy Award to Mandela, who was then a political
prisoner, the Sunday Times of Johannesburg reported.
	   Mandela met with the singers in private on Sunday.

Iraq accuses neighbors of failing to hunt down criminals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq says that neighboring countries have
refused its requests for help in apprehending criminals, the
Al-Musawir newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The state-run weekly quoted Iraq's liaison with Interpol, Brig.
Saad al-Taai, as complaining about ``the poor cooperation'' he has
received from other Arab countries ``to preserve security and
pursue the outlaws.''
	   He did not name any of the suspects, but Iraq has previously
sought help in tracking down Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
opponents, many of whom have fled the country.
	   Iraq has accused some of stealing government money. And it
charges that they have joined Iraqi opposition groups abroad,
allegedly with U.S. backing.
	   Al-Taai specifically mentioned Jordan, saying the country failed
to hand over an Iraqi suspect who was in Jordanian police custody
for at least five days. He did not name the Iraqi or say what crime
he was sought for.

Violence unabating, Serbian police advance against Kosovo rebels

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces advanced Sunday against
Kosovo Albanian rebels, driving them from at least two villages and
clearing barricades from a strategic road. At least two Serb
policemen died.
	   The state Tanjug news agency reported the police drove ethnic
Albanian secessionists from the villages of Banja and Zociste, as
well as a nearby Serbian Orthodox monastery in central Kosovo which
the guerrilla had controlled since early this month.
	   But the gains have come at a price: the Serbian Media Center in
the province's capital Pristina said two policemen have been killed
and another two were wounded south of here.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by independence-seeking
Albanians, reported ``at least'' 10 Serb policemen have died in the
fighting, while the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army suffered one dead
and one wounded.
	   Serbs source claimed that 11 ethnic Albanians died in fighting
south of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government
forces on another front in western Kosovo, where police was
attacking rebel positions near the border with Albania _ from which
they smuggle weapons.
	   Those reports could not be confirmed. Reporters trying to reach
the area were turned back by the police, But heavy explosions could
be heard. Thick clouds of smoke rose in the distance above the
scene of the fighting.
	   On the road between Pristina and the province's second-largest
town, Pec, police reportedly cleared some of the barricades rebels
had erected weeks ago.
	   Fighting continued along the road Sunday, and the Serbian Media
Center conceded that ``armed Albanians are giving strong
resistance.''
	   Success by government troops could open way for talks on the
province's future between moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The KLA has refused to acknowledge Rugova's leadership because
he opposes violence. U.S. and European mediation has focused on
bringing the two sides to the table.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo called on the United
States, NATO and other foreign governments to halt the fighting,
warning it could increase ``the danger of total and bloody war'' in
Kosovo, where Albanians form 90 percent of the population.
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' Rugova's party said.
	   Rugova also backs full independence for the Kosovo - which the
international community rules out - but the West is promoting him
as the chief Kosovo Albanian representative because he opposes
violence.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore autonomy, which he abolished in
1989, but opposes independence. Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and
Montenegro and there have been speculations that status for Kosovo,
currently part of Serbia, could be upgraded to a third partner in
the Yugoslav federation.
	   Hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands of others
have fled their homes, since long-standing tensions erupted into
violent clashes five months ago, following a crackdown by Serb-led
security forces.

Dozens of children vaccinated after English boy dies of meningitis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUDRESSELLES, France (AP) _ Authorities have vaccinated 76
children at a camping site near the northern port of Calais, where
an English boy stayed with his family before dying of meningitis,
officials said Sunday.
	   The 5-year-old boy died overnight Saturday at a hospital in the
western city of Nantes, where he was admitted Friday night,
officials said, declining to give the boy's name.
	   Upon learning of the boy's hospitalization, health officials
quickly alerted authorities in Audresselles, where the boy's family
had stayed at the Les Ajoncs camping site overnight Tuesday.
	   Seventy-six children were vaccinated there, though three
families that had stayed at the camp _ two Belgian and one Dutch _
were yet to be contacted, authorities said on customary anonymity.

Kohl's government considering new election-year plan to fight
</HEADLINE>
unemployment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Looking for ways to fight Germany's
chronically high joblessness, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
is considering a plan that would allow long-term unemployed who
take low-paying jobs to continue receiving unemployment benefits.
	   A Labor Ministry spokesman on Saturday confirmed a report in
this week's Der Spiegel newsmagazine, which said a government
working group is drafting plans for a ``combi-wage'' financed
partly by government benefits, to be published before the Sept. 27
election.
	   The spokesman said the group is to finish its work early next
month, meaning there would not be enough time to enact any
proposals until after the election.
	   Germany's double-digit unemployment rate has been the main issue
in this year's election campaign. Kohl has been trailing the
opposition Social Democrats, who accuse him of not doing enough to
put Germans back to work.
	   Kohl, however, has pointed to recent declines in the jobless
rate _ to 10.5 percent in June _ as evidence that his policies are
working and a turnaround is underway.
	   Others, including the chairman of the government's council of
economic advisers, say the drop is due in large part to seasonal
factors and warn it is too soon to talk about a downward trend.
	   Kurt Biedenkopf, the governor of Saxony state and a member of
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, told German radio Sunday that
the recent developments were very gratifying, ``but it would be
false to say that we are over the mountain in reference to the job
market.''

Eight injured in bomb explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a bus picking up
passengers at a bus terminal in the Indian capital Sunday, injuring
eight people, domestic news agencies reported.
	   Most of the injured were passengers sitting in the bus while
waiting for it to fill up, the United News of India reported. Three
of them are reportedly in serious condition with head injuries.
	   Several vehicles parked near the bus were also damaged in the
blast, the report said.
	   The bomb appeared to have been placed in the back of the bus.
The small explosion occurred just before noon, police said
according to UNI.
	   Sunday's explosion was the third in New Delhi this year. One
person was killed and more than 50 were injured in an explosion
outside the police chief's office in central Delhi in January. Two
people were injured in another explosion in June in southern Delhi.
	   It was not immediately clear who was behind the explosions.

Two off-duty soldiers killed in violent Karachi neighborhood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Two off-duty soldiers were shot and
killed execution-style Sunday in a cemetery in a Karachi
neighborhood overwhelmed by factional fighting, police said.
	   The soldiers, wearing civilian clothes, disappeared from a
market earlier Sunday and were later found shot in the head with
their hands tied behind their backs.
	   The army refused comment.
	   Police linked the killings to a crackdown over the last 10 days
during which paramilitary troops have arrested more than 500 people
in Karachi's Liaqatabad neighborhood. Police did not say which of
Liaqatabad's two main factions was believed responsible.
	   The paramilitary troops are trying to quell fighting between the
Mohajir Quami Movement and a breakaway faction that has left more
than 250 dead in the last six weeks. The MQM, which is a member of
Pakistan's governing coalition, represents Muslims who moved to
officially Islamic Pakistan from predominately Hindu India when the
two independent countries were carved out of one British colony in
1947.
	   Muslims from India, known as Mohajirs, have long claimed they
were neglected by the government. Militants turned to violence to
press their demands to be treated the same as Pakistan-born
Muslims, but soon began fighting each other for power.

Minister accuses Turkey of phony furor over missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Cypriot minister on Sunday accused
Turkey of trying to wreck the island's economy by creating a furor
over the Greek Cypriots' planned purchase of anti-aircraft
missiles.
	   ``Turkey's objective through the constant threats of the use of
force is to consolidate the occupation of (northern) Cyprus and to
strike at the strength of our economy,'' said Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey's 1974 invasion, which was
sparked by an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized
only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel reiterated warnings Saturday
that Turkey would prevent the planned deployment of the Russian
S-300 missiles.
	   ``Their preparations for military intervention, their missiles,
their bases, their adventurous aspirations will only bring tears
and pain,'' Demirel said during a visit to the Turkish Cypriot
north of the island to mark the 24th anniversary of the Turkish
invasion.
	   The Greek Cypriots plan to deploy the missiles later this year.
	   Purchase of the missiles has been criticized by the United
States and other Western governments, which argue that they will
raise tension in the region.
	   Several European countries have cautioned their nationals
against visiting the island. The Cyprus economy depends heavily on
tourism, which currently brings some 2.2 million visitors annually.
	   Omirou said the missiles are purely defensive and pose a threat
only to an aggressor.

Turkish prime minister inaugurates Ford motor plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KOCAELI, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Sunday
broke ground for a dlrs 550 million Ford auto plant which nearly
cost him his office last week.
	   Opposition parties tried to censure Yilmaz for allowing
state-owned land to be used free of charge in the joint venture
between Ford Motor Company and Turkey's largest industrial holding,
Koc Holding. They failed to muster enough votes.
	   Yilmaz was defensive at the ceremony in Kocaeli, northwestern
Turkey.
	   ``The plant will use the highest technology existing on a plot
of land that has no agricultural value,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Some 160,000 cars, trucks and minivans per year will be built at
the plant which hopes to begin production in 2000. The plant will
employ some 4,000 people.
	   Ford vice-chairman Wayne Booker called the factory a
``world-class plant'' and promised ``high quality, reliable,
durable and affordable'' cars that would enhance Turkey's image as
an emerging manufacturer.

Japan's Obuchi to promise economic boost during ASEAN meetings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Obuchi reassuring U.S. he'll be decisive on
economy, ADDS Thai, Estrada comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Japan's prime minister-in-waiting,
Keizo Obuchi, gave repeated assurances in meetings Sunday with the
United States and Asian countries that he would act decisively to
revitalize its economy.
	   ``I can and I will act. I will act promptly,'' a senior U.S.
official quoted Obuchi as telling U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright shortly after both arrived for the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum. ``Several times he
indicated his determination to revitalize the Japanese economy''
through tax cuts, elimination of bad bank loans and additional
budget expenditures, said the U.S. official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   The U.S.-Japanese meeting was added to the schedule at the last
minute after Obuchi, Japan's foreign minister, was elected Friday
as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, a post that
virtually guarantees he will become prime minister this week.
	   Obuchi, 61, is not known as a forceful politician, and financial
market observers are fearful he will not be able to fulfill his
pledges.
	   During the meeting with Albright, Obuchi was described by the
senior U.S. official as ``going out of his way to say he will be
very decisive and dynamic in dealing with the economic problems.''
	   Albright also told Obuchi that U.S. President Bill Clinton was
looking forward to meeting him in the near future, the official
said.
	   On the flight from Tokyo to Manila, Obuchi told reporters that
during his visit of less than 12 hours, ``I want to communicate
strongly my ideas for revitalizing the domestic economy and making
a contribution to Asia.''
	   Southeast Asian nations, suffering from a yearlong economic and
financial crisis, are depending on Japan, their biggest investor
and aid provider, to pull Asia out of the doldrums.
	   Japan ``is the engine of growth of Asia'' and can help most by
getting ``its own financial house in order,'' said Thailand's
Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kobsak Chutikul. ``The financial
disease started in Japan in 1991-92, and they never cured it. So it
cropped up somewhere else, like malaria. We were the manifestation
of that disease.''
	   Asked by reporters on the plane about his choice for finance
minister in the new administration, Obuchi said, ``This will be the
economic revitalization Cabinet, so of course I want someone
appropriate for that.''
	   He said someone who could grapple with the bad-debt problems
hanging over the financial sector in particular would be needed.
	   Obuchi met separately with the foreign ministers of Russia,
China and South Korea, and with Philippine President Joseph
Estrada, before attending a dinner with the Southeast Asian foreign
ministers and those from other major Asian and Western powers.
	   Estrada said Obuchi promised to work for closer ties between the
two countries and to provide more economic help to the Philippines.
	   ``He is a very intelligent man and he has also a heart for the
poor,'' Estrada told reporters after his meeting.

German police find themselves with wrong car at VW festival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Don't show up at a Volkswagen festival
driving another brand of car is the lesson Potsdam police learned
early Sunday.
	   Officers called to a scuffle at the ``International VW Blowout
1998'' near Luckau, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Berlin,
found themselves dodging insults and bottles thrown by drunken
revelers.
	   The reason? The officers were driving a car made by Opel, the
German subsidiary of General Motors.
	   A police spokesman said no one was injured in the melee and no
arrests made.
	   About 38,000 people attended the weekend VW celebration, which
included runs on an obstacle course and an auto beauty contest.
	   Four people were injured during an illegal car race held after
the official program, police said. One of the four was
hospitalized, but the spokesman had no other details.

Cork leads and England fight back
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Dominic Cork led a remarkable England
fight back with an outstanding spell of medium pace bowling in the
fourth cricket test against South Africa at Trent Bridge Sunday.
	   After England had conceded a 38-run lead, South Africa struggled
to 169 for six at lunch on the fourth day, with an overall lead of
207 runs.
	   South Africa, resuming on 92 for three, lost Daryll Cullinan
(56), Jonty Rhodes (2) and Shaun Pollock (7) in an eight-over
spell.
	   Only half centuries by Cullinan and skipper Hansie Cronje, 62
not out, has propped the South African second innings as it slumped
to 21 for three on the third day.
	   Cullinan and Cronje shared 98 for the fourth wicket in 136
minutes before Cullinan whipped Angus Fraser to Mark Ramprakash at
square leg.
	   South Africa's second innings collapse _ 2-10 in 14 balls to
Cork _ was compounded by another umpiring error _ Jonty Rhodes
adjudged caught behind off his pad by English umpire Mervyn
Kitchen.
	   The match has so far been dogged by at least five contentious
umpiring decisions between Kitchen and International Cricket
Council's independent umpire, New Zealander Steve Dunne.
	   Cronje, the inform South African batsman and fresh after his 126
in the first innings, has kept his side's batting intact with a
sheet-anchor innings. Batting with him was Mark Boucher, 20 not out
at lunch.
	   Cronje was joined by Boucher at the fall of Shaun Pollock, which
reduced South Africa to 136 for six, 40 minute before lunch.
	   Cork, who had his put his England place on line after some
disappointing bowling earlier in the series, has so far claimed
3-42 while Fraser has 2-42.

Report: Israeli award to insurance firm sued over Holocaust claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to give
an award to an Italian insurance giant being sued for failing to
pay out thousands of policies of Holocaust victims, Israel Radio
said Sunday.
	   The award is being given to Assicurazioni Generali, based in
Trieste, Italy, for contributing to the Israeli economy through its
purchase of the Israeli insurance company Migdal, the radio report
said.
	   Michael Kleiner, a legislator in Netanyahu's Likud Party, said
the award should not go to a company that has refused to pay
policies of Jews who perished at the hands of the Nazis during
World War II.
	   ``It completely lacks sensitivity to give a prize to to the
president of a company which is sitting on the money of Jews who
were killed in the Holocaust,'' Kleiner said.
	   Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond to requests by
The Associated Press for comment.
	   Generali has said it is not liable for the unpaid policies
because many of its east European offices and assets were taken
over by communist governments after World War II.
	   The Italian company is one of 16 European insurance companies
named in a federal class-action suit filed last year in New York.
Another suit was filed in February in a Los Angeles Superior Court
by family members of five Holocaust victims.
	   Some Jewish leaders, however, have praised Generali for actions
such as assisting Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial,
in gathering lists of Holocaust victims.
	   Last year, Generali established a dlrs 12 million fund for
Holocaust survivors. And the company has expressed support for an
international commission to investigate claims by victims and their
families.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces advanced Sunday against
Kosovo Albanian rebels, driving them from at least two villages and
clearing barricades from a strategic road. At least two Serb police
officers were killed.
	   The state Tanjug news agency reported the police drove ethnic
Albanian secessionists from the villages of Banja and Zociste, as
well as a nearby Serbian Orthodox monastery in central Kosovo that
the guerrilla had controlled since early this month.
	   Two Serb police officers were killed and two others were
wounded, according to the Serbian Media Center in the province's
capital Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians, reported ``at least'' 10 Serb policemen were
killed in the fighting, while the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
suffered one dead and one wounded.
	   Serb sources said that 11 ethnic Albanians died in fighting
south of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government
forces on another front in western Kosovo, where police were
attacking rebel positions Albanian border, where rebels are
bringing in weapons.
	   Those reports could not be confirmed. Reporters trying to reach
the area were turned back by police, But heavy explosions could be
heard. Thick clouds of smoke rose in the distance above the scene
of the fighting.
	   On the road between Pristina and the province's second-largest
town, Pec, police reportedly cleared some of the barricades rebels
had erected weeks ago.
	   Fighting continued along the road Sunday, and the Serbian Media
Center conceded that ``armed Albanians are giving strong
resistance.''
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is part of the Yugoslav
federation. About 90 percent of the 2 million people living in
Kosovo are ethnic Albanian.
	   Hundreds of people have died and tens of thousands of others
have fled their homes, since long-standing tensions erupted into
violent clashes five months ago.
	   Success by government troops could open the way for talks on the
province's future between moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The KLA has refused to acknowledge Rugova's leadership because
he opposes violence. U.S. and European mediation has focused on
bringing the two sides to the table.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo said Sunday that the United
States, NATO and other foreign governments should pressure the
government to halt the fighting, warning it could increase ``the
danger of total and bloody war'' in Kosovo.
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' Rugova's party said.
	   Although Rugova also backs independence, which Western powers
oppose, the United States and Europe have been promoting him as a
leader of the ethnic Albanian side in future talks because he
opposes violence.
	   Milosevic has offered to restore autonomy, which he abolished in
1989, but opposes independence. Yugoslavia consists of Serbia and
Montenegro and there have been speculations that status for Kosovo,
currently part of Serbia, could be upgraded to a third partner in
the Yugoslav federation.

Renovations begin at campus shunned by aid groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)_ Workers strung power lines and patched
bullet-scarred walls Sunday at the war-ravaged Kabul campus that is
the center of a dispute between Afghanistan's Taliban government
and international humanitarian groups.
	   Some 200 workers from 38 aid organizations left Afghanistan a
week ago rather than obey Taliban orders to move from homes and
offices elsewhere in the capital to the campus' dilapidated
dormitories. The government wants the organizations to pay dlrs
800,000 to rebuild the Kabul Polytechnic Institute, saying the
advance payment will later be deducted from rent.
	   The aid groups say they don't have the money and the dormitories
are uninhabitable. Only jagged shards of glass remain in most
windows and buildings lack electricity and running water.
	   The United Nations, which relied on the 38 independent
organizations to carry out or supplement its food, health and other
aid programs in Afghanistan, has requested talks to resolve the
dormitory dispute. Taliban officials have said they are eager to
talk, and the work that started Sunday could be taken as a sign of
good faith.
	   Attempts to reach aid officials Sunday in neighboring Pakistan
were unsuccessful. International aid to Afghanistan is coordinated
from the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.
	   Kabul Polytechnic director Anwar ul Haq said Sunday that four
local construction companies had been contracted to begin
renovations. He did not say how the government planned to pay for
the work.
	   ``First we want to rebuild the mosque and dormitories,'' ul Haq
said. ``We want to repair them because we want to use them, whether
(aid groups) come here or not.''
	   The campus was a no-man's land during years of faction fighting
after Muslim groups ousted a communist government in Kabul in 1992.
The Taliban religious militia took over Kabul in 1996 and set about
imposing a strict brand of Islamic law and order.
	   Fighting continues north of the city and an occasional rocket
still lands in the capital.
	   Classes for 1,000 students resumed at Kabul Polytechnic under
the Taliban. Two hundred of the students are living in a block of
the dormitories shunned by aid groups.
	   The Soviets helped build the institute two decades ago for
10,000 geology and engineering students, both men and women. The
Taliban, who frown on higher education for women, reopened the
school for men only.

Flooding forces families into muddy lean-tos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JUNSHAN, China (AP) _ Zhuan Jianxia's family lives on a muddy
dike above their flooded house. Home is a lean-to of nylon sheeting
that doesn't always keep out the constant drizzle. They bathe in a
bucket.
	   On Sunday, the first sunny day in two weeks in rain-soaked
Junshan town on central China's Dongting lakes, Zhuan and his wife,
Sun Zishan, waded back into their home to move belongings outside
to dry.
	   ``We've lived here for 10 years. Nothing like this has ever
happened before,'' Zhuan said. Dressed in swim trunks, he carried a
mattress through knee-deep water.
	   So far, the couple and their neighbors have been lucky. The
water that drove more than 100 people from their homes in Junshan
is relatively shallow runoff from rain. On the other side of the
dike, a few feet (meters) away, the rain-swollen lake now stands
higher than the rooftops of Junshan.
	   If the dike gives way, scores of homes could disappear beneath
the water.
	   Authorities warned Sunday that waterlogged dikes in cities and
towns like this in areas along the Yangtze River are in danger of
collapse after weeks of unusually heavy summer rains.
	   Water levels were at the highest levels ever recorded on 300
kilometers (180 miles) of the Yangtze, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported. Shipping was suspended along the river east and
west of the Dongting lakes to prevent unnecessary wear on flood
barriers.
	   In Hunan province, where Junshan is located, some 1.7 million
people have been mobilized to reinforce dikes and dams, Xinhua
said. Despite that, dikes have been breached in several places
along the Dongting lakes, which connect to the Yangtze at their
northern end.
	   Soldiers used convoys of motorized rubber boats to rescue more
than 27,000 people after Yangtze tributaries submerged parts of Li
County, west of the Dongting lakes, Xinhua said.
	   In areas of Junshan outside the dike, the shoreline has pushed
at least 500 meters (yards) inland. Dozens of rooftops stick out of
the water. Far out in the lake, a banner wishing passengers a
pleasant trip sticks out of the water, the only sign of a submerged
ferry terminal.
	   Families have moored boats at a makeshift landing on the dike,
just below huts that line the 10-foot-wide (3-meter-wide) path on
the dike's peak.
	   The dike, a grassy berm made of earth and rocks, is holding so
far and appears well-maintained. The lake laps two meters (six
feet) below the top.
	   On Sunday, large pumps sucked water out of the low-lying area
around Zhuan and Sun's house and drained it into the lake as
friends helped to carry out furniture, bedding and other
belongings. Sun looked incongruously chic in a white sun hat and a
pair of chest-high fisherman's waders, while her husband went
barefoot in the red mud.
	   With nowhere to take their belongings during days of rain, the
couple piled them on stacks of wood and bricks in the middle of
their three rooms. A picture of Zhuan's parents on the living room
wall looks down on plastic bottles, toys and other odds and ends
floating in the water.
	   ``There's nothing we can do,'' Zhuan, 34, said with a smile and
a shrug. His 30-year-old wife apologized to visitors for not being
able to serve tea.

Peace group: Jewish settlement building doubled in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Israel and the Palestinians bitterly debate
the future of the West Bank, building in Jewish settlements there
has more than doubled in the first quarter of 1998, an Israeli
peace group said Sunday.
	   In the first three months of this year, construction of 730 new
homes started in the settlements, compared with 310 in the same
period last year _ an increase of 130 percent, the group Peace Now
said.
	   The growth of government-funded construction was even higher _
560 homes in the first quarter compared with 130 last year, or an
increase of 330 percent, according to Peace Now.
	   The group said its figures were compiled by Israel's Central
Bureau of Statistics, but statistics bureau officials said they
could not confirm the numbers.
	   ``The government is building as much for each settler as for an
nine ordinary Israelis,'' Peace Now leader Mossi Raz told Israel
Radio. ``The settlers are drowning in the sea of taxpayers' money
which the government is pouring onto them.''
	   Land is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because the
Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinians charge that expansion of the
settlements is an attempt to pre-empt talks on a final peace
settlement, and the United States has called on Israel to freeze
settlement construction as a good-faith gesture.

Iran denies executing member of Baha'i sect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran denied Sunday that it had executed a
member of the Baha'i sect and described reports of his hanging as
``a total lie,'' Iranian television reported.
	   Earlier this month, the United States and the United Nations
condemned Iran for allegedly executing Ruhollah Rowhani after he
was charged with converting to the Baha'i faith from Islam.
	   ``Essentially, none of the branches of the court has issued a
death sentence for a person named Ruhollah Rowhani, affiliated to
the Baha'i sect. The report of his execution is a total lie,'' the
state-run television quoted the head of the Islamic Revolution
Court, Judge Gholamhossein Rahbarpur, as saying.
	   He also said none of Iran's provincial courts had issued such a
sentence, the television said.
	   The broadcast accused the West of ``widespread propaganda'' over
the case.
	   Under Iran's Islamic Penal Code, apostasy _ abandoning Islam _
is not pardonable, and any citizen can carry out the execution of
someone who converts.
	   The Baha'i religion, with about 5 million followers in 100
countries, is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Some 300,000 Baha'is
live in Iran, where the faith was founded in the 19th century.
	   Iran's religious leaders contend the religion is a heretic cult.
	   International human rights groups repeatedly have condemned Iran
for its repression of religious minorities, particularly the
Baha'is and Christians.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with graf 3 change to Sunday evening, ADDS government
statements in grafs 6, 12-13. TRIMS at end &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's
colleagues expressed hope Sunday that a compromise would be reached
with Myanmar's military to end a standoff on a highway outside of
Yangon that has entered its third day.
	   ``We hope that it will end today,'' said Tin Oo, vice chairman
of the National League for Democracy, of which Suu Kyi is general
secretary.
	   As of Sunday evening, Suu Kyi, a colleague and two drivers were
still stuck in her white sedan about 51 kilometers (32 miles) west
of Yangon, the capital.
	   The military stopped her there Friday morning as she was
attempting to travel to Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of
the capital, to meet some of her party members.
	   Suu Kyi has now spent two nights in the car. Her party members
said she was surrounded by soldiers, sandbags and barbed wire
barricades put there by the government to prevent her from driving
on.
	   The government, however, said in a statement faxed to Bangkok:
``In fact, there existed none of these around the car. It is their
own rigid and confrontational policy which has made them spend the
night in the car.''
	   Tin Oo said he thought the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner would
return home if the military promised to let the party members she
wanted to meet come to Yangon.
	   On two previous trips on July 7 and 20, a compromise was reached
where the military brought people Suu Kyi was attempting to see to
her car.
	   She has made three attempts this month to travel outside Yangon,
and the military has stopped her three times.
	   During the first attempt, more than 30 soldiers lifted Suu Kyi's
car with her inside it, and turned it around to face Yangon.
	   The military government denies she is under house arrest.
	   In its statement Sunday, it said Suu Kyi ``has been free to
generally move about and agitate against the government as she ever
has. But of course there are limits just as there are anywhere as
to how much unrest a person or an organization may stir up.''
	   The government said that ``with patience and wisdom'' it has
been ``avoiding the collision course initiated'' by Suu Kyi and her
party.
	   The military has cited no law that Suu Kyi is breaking by
traveling outside the capital to meet members of her party, which
is a legal organization in Myanmar.
	   Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   Suu Kyi was traveling to Bassein to tell party members not to
obey a military order to report to the authorities twice a day
under the ``Habitual Offenders Act,'' a law reserved for those
considered heinous criminals by the government.

Grandson of first flyer across English Channel fails new attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available

<TEXT>
	   CALAIS, France (AP) _ The grandson of the first pilot to cross
the English Channel 89 years ago failed to re-stage the feat Sunday
when he crashed his rickety bi-plane into the water.
	   Louis Bleriot, a 54-year-old French banker with the same name as
his engineer grandfather, took off from a beach near this northern
port aboard one of the planes his grandfather built in 1909.
	   Bleriot had hoped to make the 50-km (30-mile) trip and land on
the cliffs of Dover, making a film of the flight for the 90th
anniversary next year, titled ``From One Bleriot to Another.''
	   The plane lifted off from Bleriot Beach, as his grandfather did
on July 25, 1909. But about two minutes later, the wobbling plane
crashed into an inlet near the beach.
	   His grandfather made the trip in 27 minutes, though he
crash-landed as well, upon arriving near Dover Castle.
	   The younger Bleriot, who has been flying for about 10 years, was
shaken but surprisingly not injured.
	   ``As soon as I started to turn, the plane didn't respond
normally and the more I corrected in one direction, and the more it
continued to go in the opposite direction... I can't explain it,''
Bleriot said.
	   It was the same plane that plunged into the sea in 1989 when
Gloria Pullen, an English woman, was within 4 kms (2.5 miles) of
completing the flight. She was also unhurt.
	   The original Bleriot crossed the Channel after the Daily Mail's
proprietor Lord Northcliffe offered a prize of 1,000 pounds (dlrs
1,600).
	   Waiting in Dover for Bleriot's grandson Sunday was John Blake, a
member of the Royal Aero Club and a 73-year-old veteran flying
commentator.
	   ``I don't think it's foolhardy,'' said Blake. ``I think it's
very brave.''

Newspapers, radio say new missile for defensive purposes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's new medium-range missile will prevent
any country from forcing its will on the Islamic republic and
ensure its independence, Iranian papers said Sunday.
	   ``One of the basic principles of the Islamic revolution is to be
independent and not accept the hegemony of any power,'' the
English-language Tehran Times said in an editorial about the
missile.
	   Iran's defense minister, Rear Adm. Ali Shamkhani, announced
Saturday that Iran had successfully tested the missile, known as
Shahab-3.
	   He said it has a range of 1,300 kilometers (800 miles). That
would allow Iran to target arch-enemy Israel or U.S. troops in
Saudi Arabia.
	   Iran News daily, in an editorial Sunday, said neighboring
governments have nothing to fear.
	   ``Iran's relations with the neighboring states are so warm and
cordial that these countries are not concerned with Iranian
missiles,'' the paper said. ``Rather, they consider them weapons to
defend their interests.''
	   The paper said that Iran's military budget was among the lowest
in region and that most of its allocations were for defensive
purposes.
	   ``To create any propaganda about the defense capability of Iran
does not help to establish stability and security in the region and
is actually considered a clear interference in Iran's domestic
affairs,'' state-run Iranian radio said.
	   Israel and the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton
have expressed concern about the missile test.
	   In his announcement Saturday, Shamkhani said the missile was
tested on Wednesday by Iranian experts ``without any foreign
support.''
	   Shamkhani gave no other details as to what type of missile was
tested or where.
	   U.S. intelligence agencies identified it as the Shahab-3 and
said that its launch and path were tracked early Wednesday.
	   The Shahab-3 is believed based on North Korea's No Dong missile,
but it remains unclear if Iran purchased equipment or technology
from the North Koreans.
	   Reports from Washington indicate that the CIA believed Iran was
getting substantial missile technology from Russia, and some from
China.

Violence unabating, Serbian police advance against Kosovo rebels

casualties; ADDS quote from a KLA fighter &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces reported advances Sunday
against Kosovo Albanian rebels, reportedly driving them from at
least two villages and clearing barricades from a strategic road.
At least two Serb policemen died.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency reported the police drove
ethnic Albanian secessionists from the villages of Banja and
Zociste, as well as a nearby Serbian Orthodox monastery in central
Kosovo which the guerrilla had controlled since early this month.
	   But the gains have come at a price: the Serbian Media Center in
the province's capital Pristina said two policemen have been killed
and another two were wounded south of here.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by independence-seeking
Albanians, reported ``at least'' 10 Serb policemen have died in the
fighting, while the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army suffered one dead
and one wounded.
	   Seven Albanian civilians, including four teenagers, have been
wounded in the area, the Albanian source said, also accusing the
police of torching Albanian homes and a school there.
	   Serbs source claimed that 11 ethnic Albanians died in fighting
south of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government
forces on another front in western Kosov.
	   Police there were attacking rebel positions near the border with
Albania _ from which the insurgents smuggle weapons.
	   Those reports could not be confirmed. Reporters trying to reach
the area were turned back by the police, But heavy explosions could
be heard. Thick clouds of smoke rose in the distance above the
scene of the fighting.
	   On the road between Pristina and the province's second-largest
town, Pec, police reportedly cleared some of the barricades rebels
had erected weeks ago.
	   Fighting continued along the road Sunday, and the Serbian Media
Center conceded that ``armed Albanians are giving strong
resistance.''
	   Albanian sources also spoke of strong resistance there by the
KLA to ``huge attacks'' by government troops, who were said to be
using 50-60 tanks against the militants.
	   In fighting north of the road, eight Albanian civilians died and
another 34 were wounded on Saturday, the same sources said.
	   Success by government troops could open way for talks on the
province's future between moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The KLA has refused to acknowledge Rugova's leadership because
he opposes violence. U.S. and European mediation has focused on
bringing the two sides to the table.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo called on the United
States, NATO and other foreign governments to halt the fighting,
warning it could increase ``the danger of total and bloody war'' in
Kosovo, where Albanians form 90 percent of the population.
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' Rugova's party said.
	   Rugova also backs full independence for the Kosovo - which the
international community rules out - but the West is promoting him
as the chief Kosovo Albanian representative because he opposes
violence.
	   However, his renunciation of violence has alienated him from
many Kosovo Albanians. Shabana Shala, a former Rugova aide who had
defected to the KLA, said in an interview published Sunday in
Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore that ``Rugova...has lost
validity because he was not capable to fulfill promises and
people's will.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has so far signed 48 contracts for the
sale of crude under the current, six-month phase of the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, a senior oil official said
Sunday.
	   Saddam al-Hassan, chairman of the State Oil Marketing
Organization, told the Iraqi News Agency that the contracts cover
the sale of 302 million barrels of Iraqi crude oil.
	   He also said that 73 million barrels have been exported so far
in the current phase, which began in early June, INA said.
	   The oil-for-food program, launched in December 1996, initially
allowed Iraq to export dlrs 2 billion every six months to buy
needed food and medicine for its 22 million people. The value was
raised during this phase to dlrs 5.2 billion.
	   Al-Hassan also said Iraq has signed 78 contracts for the
purchase of spare parts for its oil industry at a cost of dlrs 80
million. But he said the U.N. sanctions committee, which vets all
Iraqi contracts, has not yet approved any of them.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception from U.N. trade
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria has amended its inheritance tax law
with the aim of encouraging investment and saving, newspapers
reported Sunday.
	   The amendment, ratified by President Hafez Assad on Saturday,
exempts bank deposits left in an estate from inheritance taxes,
which range from 40 percent to 60 percent.
	   Family members who inherit a house also are exempt, according to
the state-run Tishrin newspaper. The exemption also covers
furniture, portraits and statues, books and art collections, the
papers said.
	   Finance Minister Khaled Mahaini told the official Syrian Arab
News Agency that the amendment was ``a new step in the way of
reforming the tax system.''
	   Some people kept their money and valuables at home rather than
in banks so their heirs wouldn't have to pay high inheritance
taxes.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Houston Mayor Lee Brown announced Sunday
that his city will host a conference on investment opportunities in
Egypt starting Oct. 20.
	   He made the remarks at a breakfast hosted by the American
Chamber of Commerce in Egypt.
	   Brown was on a visit here to discuss boosting trade and
investment ties with Egypt. Among the officials he met was Ibrahim
Fawzi, head of Egypt's General Authority for Investment and Free
Trade Areas.
	   The conference is expected to draw a number of Texas businessmen
and focus on energy, trade, tourism, medical and maritime sectors,
Fawzi said in a statement issued Sunday.
	   Brown also met with Oil Minister Hamdy el-Banbi, Economy
Minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali and Public Sector Minister Atef
Obeid.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A Central Bank official on Sunday lashed
out at Jordanian money changers and other citizens who sold
Jordanian dinars to buy dollars in recent days.
	   The official, Saeed Shahin, told The Associated Press there was
``no meaning for the rush on the dollar.''
	   He added that the Central Bank was supporting the dinar with
dlrs 1.5 billion in dollar deposits, other foreign currency and
gold.
	   Traders in neighboring countries said the dinar has weakened to
about .74 piasters to the dollar from .71 piasters in the past week
amid reports that King Hussein may be suffering from cancer.
	   Shahin stressed that commercial banks in Jordan were ready to
supply dollars on demand.
	   Abdul-Majeed Shouman, chairman of the board of the Arab Bank,
Jordan's largest bank, said the banking system was ``strong and
stable'' and that there was ``no excuse for this rush on the
dollar.''

	   PORT SAID, Egypt (AP) _ Revenues from the Suez Canal were dlrs
1.76 billion for the 1997-98 financial year, down 2.4 percent from
the previous year, the chairman of the Suez Canal Authority said
Sunday.
	   Lt. Gen. Ahmed Ali Fadel said the income includes dlrs 154
million resulting from efforts by the canal authority to attract
giant oil tankers away from the route around the Cape of Good Hope.
Fadel addressed a news conference on the 42nd anniversary of
Egypt's nationalizing the waterway.
	   He said the drop in revenues was partly due to the economic
troubles in the Southeast Asian countries. The canal's revenues
have suffered for years because of the super tankers' route around
the tip of Africa and the shipping of oil by pipeline.
	   The canal authority said in January that it would not change
raise fees in 1998 for the forth year running, but Fadel said the
canal authority was studying new fees which could be announced late
this year to take effect in 1999.
	   He said the canal's draft will be increased three more feet next
year to reach 62 feet allowing tankers with a capacity of 250,000
tons to cross the waterway.

Tanaka wins Aiful Cup

<TEXT>
	   AOMORI, Japan (AP) _ Hidemichi Tanaka fired a 6-under-par 66
Sunday and won the Aiful Cup by one stroke, his first victory in
two years.
	   Tanaka, who last won in the 1996 Pepsi Ube, birdied the first
two holes and sank four more birdies on the back nine for a
15-under 273 total. He started the round three shots off the pace.
	   Tatsuo Takasaki tied for the day's best score, 66, and shared
second place at 274 with overnight co-leader Toshimitsu Izawa, who
had a 70.
	   Tanaka received 18 million yen (dlrs 128,000) from a purse of
100 million yen (dlrs 714,000) for the victory, his third in seven
years as a pro.
	   Steven Conran of Australia, the other co-leader overnight, had a
73 and fell into a three-way tie for 10th at 277. He had led for
the first three rounds, seeking his first victory since joining the
Japan tour two years ago.
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, who was in contention for his 108th
career title and his second victory in two weeks, also shot a 73
and was in a group of five sharing 14th at 279.

Polish Catholics place more crosses near Auschwitz memorial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish Catholics placed dozens of wooden
crosses over the weekend outside the former Nazi death camp of
Auschwitz around a towering cross that some Jewish groups call
offensive and want removed.
	   Kazimierz Switon, who began a hunger strike to demand the cross
remain, ended his 42-day fast Saturday at the request of two
bishops, but called on Catholics around Poland to place more
crosses near the controversial one, which commemorates a 1979 papal
Mass.
	   Late Saturday, several dozen Catholics from Silesia placed a
three-meter-tall (10-feet-tall) cross and about 50 smaller ones
outside the walls of the camp, a dozen meters (40 feet) away from
the papal cross, the PAP news agency reported.
	   Jewish organizations say the 8-meter-tall (26-foot-tall) papal
cross, visible from the former death camp, disturbs the memory of
the Jews who died there and want it removed.
	   But many Poles view the cross _ located where 152 Nazi resisters
were murdered in 1941 _ as a symbol of the nation's martyrdom under
German occupation.
	   Poland's Roman Catholic Church officials say they plan no
decision in the near future concerning the cross.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ai Sugiyama and Miho Saeki won two
more singles matches Sunday, giving Japan a 4-1 victory over South
Korea in Fed Cup regional tennis qualifying competition.
	   Sugiyama, ranked No. 17 on the WTA tour, clinched Japan's

prevailed with sharp serves and powerful strokes.
	   Miho Saeki then put Japan ahead 4-0 by beating Cho Yoon-jung
6-4, 6-3. Saeki had defeated Kim Eun-ha 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed groups killed at least 20 people
overnight in western Algeria, the first massacres since a U.N.
fact-finding mission arrived to investigate a Muslim insurgency.
	   Security forces said 12 people were killed in the village of
Khelil, near the town of Tlemcen on the Moroccan border. Hospital
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 15 were slashed
to death and two wounded by gunfire.
	   Interior Minister Mustapha Benmansour visited the site, and
security forces were mobilized early Sunday to search for the
attackers, officials said.
	   Another armed group killed eight people overnight in Sidi
Athmane near Saida, 420 kms (250 miles) southwest of Algiers,
authorities and hospital officials said.
	   There was no claim of responsibility, but suspicion fell on
Muslim militants waging a 6 1/2-year-old struggle to topple the
military-backed government that canceled January 1992 elections the
Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in the insurgency. While the
Salvation Front has condemned massacres, the Armed Islamic Group
has been linked to the slaughter of hundreds of villagers in recent
months.
	   The wave of killings prompted the visit by a six-member U.N.
panel, led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares. The mission
arrived Wednesday for what was expected to be a two-week visit.
	   There was no immediate comment by the panel about the latest
killings.
	   So far, the panel had yet to visit massacre sites, and the
government was not expected to allow the group to meet with the
Salvation Front, banned in 1992.
	   On Friday, an Algerian human rights leader told the mission that
security forces could be responsible for the disappearances of as
many as 18,000 people since 1994.
	   The mission, which is to report back to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, is looking into allegations the government of the
petroleum-rich North African nation had at least a passive role in
the massacres.

	   ASTRAZUB, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The stories spread like a fire,
hotter and stronger in the telling and retelling.
	   Serb forces gouged eyes, burned Albanian civilians alive, beat
them, shot them, slit their throats, and with bloody knives cut the
Serbian cross into their victim's flesh. The bodies were taken to
mass graves.
	   These are survivor tales of last week's battle for Orahovac, one
of the nastiest fights yet in the five-month war over Serb-ruled
Kosovo province, where the ethnic Albanian majority wants
independence. But how many people actually died in Orahovac isn't
clear. And it may never be.
	   Serbs deny targeting Albanian civilians. Albanian politicans put
the civilian death toll at about 120. Witness accounts would make
it many times that.
	   It's a messy stew of information typical for Kosovo, where
centuries of ethnic hatred and Balkan traditions of oral history
make the ``truth'' a confusing blend of fact, secrecy and
hyperbole.
	   Serbs speak of Kosovo Liberation Army atrocities against their
people _ murder, kidnapping, rape. Albanians say the reverse. And
facts become irrelevant, giving way to what each community believes
is true. Stories of barbarity and butchery only fuel mutual
recriminations and drive the Serbs and Albanians farther apart.
	   In the case of Orahovac, two things are indisputable: The Serbs
won, driving the Kosovo Liberation Army into the surrounding hills.
And the fight created some 20,000 refugees, many of them living
with illness and filth in villages without medicine or electricity.
	   Here in Astrazub, a doctor worked by candlelight in an abandoned
school, rushing around his tiny office to treat a stream of
patients. He swabbed a wailing, feverish baby with alcohol, wrapped
a toddler in water-soaked gauze, took the blood pressure of an
elderly woman.
	   ``The Red Cross hasn't been here and we have nothing. We have an
epidemic of diarrhea, and children are going to die,'' the doctor
said Friday night, adding that refugees had more than tripled the
village population of 3,000.
	   A refugee from Orahovac himself, the doctor refused to give his
name for fear of Serb retribution.
	   Outside, dozens of exhausted people milled around, some dazed,
others speaking of atrocities they saw _ or heard about _ during
the five days of fighting that ended last Tuesday.
	   One man sobbed, pressing his palm over his eyes. After a few
minutes, he said he survived by darting through the town's narrow
streets.
	   He said he peeked around a building amd saw police stab his
neighbor 66-year-old Ali Spahiju in the head and carve the Serb
symbol on his face. He said the man's wife tried to hide in a
cellar but Serbs broke in and opened fire, wounding her with
bullets that ricocheted off the walls.
	   The man, who refused to give his name out of fear, said the
Serbs burned his house and robbed women of gold jewelry, tucking it
as trophies into their black head scarves. He and others described
Serbs attacking the mosque, where 500 people had sought refuge.
	   ``The Serbs cut out the eyes and slit throats,'' Zumici Gani,
60, claimed, though he had only heard about the attack. He said
that before journalists arrived, Serbs came in and washed the
streets of blood.

Minister accuses Turkey of phony furor over missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS grafs 5-6 with comment from Turkish foreign minister. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Cypriot minister on Sunday accused
Turkey of trying to wreck the island's economy by creating a furor
over the Greek Cypriots' planned purchase of Russian anti-aircraft
missiles.
	   ``Turkey's objective through the constant threats of the use of
force is to consolidate the occupation of (northern) Cyprus and to
strike at the strength of our economy,'' said Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou.
	   He was reacting to statements on Saturday by Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel, who reiterated warnings that Turkey would prevent
the planned deployment of the Russian S-300 missiles.
	   ``Their preparations for military intervention, their missiles,
their bases, their adventurous aspirations will only bring tears
and pain,'' Demirel said during a visit to the Turkish Cypriot
north of the island to mark the 24th anniversary of the Turkish
invasion.
	   In Ankara on Sunday, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said
Sunday the missiles would threaten not only northern Cyprus but
also other eastern Mediterranean countries, including Turkey, as
well as NATO defense systems.
	   ``With their strong radars, the S-300 command systems _ to be
operated by Russian military personnel together with Greek Cypriot
soldiers _ will control a large area, including the Incirlik air
base,'' Cem said. Incirlik in southern Turkey is used by British
and U.S. jets.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since the 1974 invasion, which was sparked
by an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized
only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The Greek Cypriots plan to deploy the missiles later this year.
	   Purchase of the missiles has been criticized by the United
States and other Western governments, who argue that they will
raise tension in the region.
	   Several European countries have cautioned their nationals
against visiting the island. The Cyprus economy depends heavily on
tourism, which currently brings some 2.2 million visitors annually.
	   Omirou said the missiles are purely defensive and pose a threat
only to an aggressor.
	   He accused critics of the missile deployment of hypocrisy.
	   ``If they had protested just as strongly about Turkey's refusal
to respect U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding the
withdrawal of the Turkish occupation troops, possibly the Cyprus
problem would have been settled a long time ago,'' he said.

Peace group: Jewish settlement building doubled in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Israel and the Palestinians bitterly debate
the future of the West Bank, building in Jewish settlements there
has more than doubled in the first quarter of 1998, an Israeli
peace group said Sunday.
	   In the first three months of this year, construction started on
730 new homes in the settlements, compared with 310 in the same
period last year, the group Peace Now said. That would be an
increase of 130 percent.
	   Government-funded construction increased 330 percent, with
construction starting on 560 homes in the first quarter compared
with 130 last year, according to Peace Now.
	   The group said its figures were compiled by Israel's Central
Bureau of Statistics, but statistics bureau officials said they
could not confirm the numbers.
	   ``The settlers are drowning in the sea of taxpayers' money which
the government is pouring onto them,'' Peace Now leader Mossi Raz
told Israel Radio.
	   Land is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because the
Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinians charge that expansion of the
settlements is an attempt to pre-empt talks on a final peace
settlement. The United States has called on Israel to freeze
settlement construction as a good-faith gesture.

New land mines hampering U.N. bid to probe massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The U.N. mission overseeing Angola's
peace process said Sunday freshly laid land mines were hampering
its attempts to investigate a massacre in which up to 200 villagers
are believed to have been killed recently in an attack blamed on
the rebel group UNITA.
	   The number of people slain in the attack, which took place
Tuesday in the small diamond mining village of Bula, about 250
miles east of Luanda, could not yet be accurately assessed, U.N.
spokesman David Wimhurst, said.
	   Government sources indicated 215 people have been killed and 70
wounded. Initial reports put the figure at closer to 100.
	   The U.N. Observer Mission in Angola, or MONUA, has tried to send
in a team to analyze the circumstances in which the attack
occurred, but has been delayed because of the fresh land mines in
the surrounding area, Wimhurst explained.
	   Survivors allege the attackers were from UNITA, but the former
guerilla group _ who signed a peace pact with the government in
1994 to end a two-decade civil war _ has denied the accusations.
	   ``The massacre is a result of antagonism between national and
foreign groups of illegal diamond miners,'' UNITA said in a
statement.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ runs diamond-mining operations in
Lunda Norte, where Bula is located. The diamonds provide the
movement with hundreds of millions of dollars annually, analysts
say.
	   The U.N. has banned UNITA's diamond exports as part of a pack of
sanctions that came into force when the former rebels failed to
abide by terms of the 1994 peace plan.

Iran denies executing member of Baha'i sect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran denied Sunday that it had executed a
member of the Baha'i sect and described reports of his hanging as
``a total lie,'' Iranian television reported.
	   Earlier this month, the United States and the United Nations
condemned Iran for allegedly executing Ruhollah Rowhani after he
was charged with converting to the Baha'i faith from Islam.
	   ``Essentially, none of the branches of the court has issued a
death sentence for a person named Ruhollah Rowhani, affiliated to
the Baha'i sect. The report of his execution is a total lie,'' the
state-run television quoted the head of the Islamic Revolution
Court, Judge Gholamhossein Rahbarpur, as saying.
	   He also said none of Iran's provincial courts had issued such a
sentence, the television said.
	   The broadcast accused the West of ``widespread propaganda'' over
the case.
	   Under Iran's Islamic Penal Code, apostasy _ abandoning Islam _
is not pardonable, and any citizen can carry out the execution of
someone who converts.
	   The Baha'i religion, with about 5 million followers in 100
countries, is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Some 300,000 Baha'is
live in Iran, where the faith was founded in the 19th century.
	   Iran's religious leaders contend the religion is a heretic cult.
	   International human rights groups repeatedly have condemned Iran
for its repression of religious minorities, particularly the
Baha'is and Christians.

Cambodians hope election will bring peace, but Khmer Rouge stage

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Millions of Cambodians voted Sunday
in parliamentary elections, hoping for a fresh chance at peace and
stability, but remnants of the murderous Khmer Rouge tarnished the
day with an attack that left 10 people dead.
	   The attack against a military outpost in the northern jungles
amounted to little more than a spoiling tactic, but signaled that
any new government must still deal with what remains of the
genocidal revolutionary group that has terrorized Cambodia since
the 1970s.
	   Elsewhere, the election unfolded in relative peace despite a
violent run-up where strongman Hun Sen was accused of murdering
opponents and intimidating voters to ensure victory for his
Cambodian People's Party.
	   But an estimated 5.3 million voters _ nearly all who had
registered _ were reported by election officials to have cast
ballots, and foreign observers monitoring the election said the
result could end up as a surprise for Hun Sen.
	   No party is expected to win a majority of the 122 National
Assembly seats. A coalition of some kind is likely between parties
led by Hun Sen and his main challengers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, and could produce either stable power-sharing or
more turmoil, as was the case in the past.
	   Hun Sen lost the last elections, organized by the United Nations
in 1993 at a cost of dlrs 3 billion, but forced the winners,
Ranariddh and his FUNCINPEC party, to accept him as co-prime
minister or face civil war. The arrangement collapsed last year
when Hun Sen deposed the prince in pitched battles in the capital.
	   Cambodians hoping to end the lingering tensions started turning
out at daybreak to cast their ballots, waiting patiently in long
lines at the 11,600 stations for polling to start at 7 a.m. The
process went smoothly, and in Phnom Penh most people had voted by
lunch-time.
	   Scattered incidents of ballot box tampering and voter
intimidation were reported, but observers were generally unanimous
that the vote had gone much better than anticipated.
	   ``I can tell you, the general assessment so far is good or very
good,'' said Jacques Carrio, an official with the U.N. mission
coordinating 678 foreign observers.
	   The worst news was the Khmer Rouge attack. National Election
Committee spokesman Samraing Kimsan said that 40 to 50 guerrillas
struck an army outpost at 5 a.m. at O'Kong Bich, an area about 10
kilometers (6 miles) west of Anlong Veng, a Khmer Rouge stronghold
that fell to the government in April.
	   One guerrilla, two soldiers and seven civilians were killed. Two
rebels were taken prisoner.
	   Defense Minister Tea Banh blamed the attack on hard-liners under
one-legged general Ta Mok. They are the last rebels still fighting
following the defection of thousands of Khmer Rouge who have made
peace in recent years.
	   For them, the day was a milestone. They cast ballots for the
first time in their lives, symbolizing what Hun Sen hopes will be
national reconciliation. However, many Cambodians and foreigners
think their leaders, at least, should be tried for crimes against
humanity.
	   The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people
when it ruled between 1975 and 1979. Its foreign minister, Ieng
Sary, is widely held responsible for mass murder but received a
royal pardon for leading the first guerrillas out of war two years
ago.
	   ``This is the first time in my life that I've participated in
voting,'' Ieng Sary said. When he was foreign minister, advocating
such practices would have meant death.
	   After polling ended, the ballot boxes were to be transported to
1,100 communal centers. Counting was to begin Monday, with
preliminary results released later in the day.
	   Stephen Solarz, a former U.S. congressman leading an independent
American observation mission, expressed fears that the tranquility
of the voting could mask a ``devious manipulation that would affect
the outcome.''
	   Voting at a school, Hun Sen kissed his ballot and rejected fears
he would call out the army if his party loses.
	   ``If my party loses, I'm ready to be a coconut vendor or a
fishermen,'' said Hun Sen, looking healthy after an appendectomy
July 17. ``Today, one can see that the Cambodian people have
achieved victory.''
	   The main opposition candidates voted in the central town of
Kompong Cham. An upbeat Ranariddh said the election represented a
``choice between democracy and totalitarianism.''
	   Sam Rainsy, whose party has suffered the brunt of pre-election
killings, was more somber.
	   ``It can be a turning point,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``I hope it
will, but I have no illusion. At least it shows the Cambodian
people want to vote. We can be disappointed later at the result.''
	   In Phnom Penh, one of the first to vote was Chan Somphon, 51, a
farmer living at a Buddhist pagoda since a land mine tore off his
left leg. One in every 300 Cambodians has been killed or maimed by
the millions of mines buried during three decades of civil war.
	   Leaning on a wooden crutch, Chan Somphon chose from the 39
parties, dropped his ballot into a locked metal box and had his
finger dipped in purple ink, a precaution to prevent multiple
voting.
	   ``I want peace for Cambodia,'' said Chan Somphon who, like most
voters, refused to state his party preference. ``No more war. If
the vote is honest, we will have peace.''

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ World No. 1 Martina Hingis labored to a
three-set comeback win over Amelie Mauresmo at the Federation Cup
world group semifinals on Sunday, giving Switzerland an unbeatable
3-0 lead over defending champions France.
	   With her hard-fought 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-2 victory over Mauresmo,
Hingis led the tiny alpine nation to its first world group final
ever.
	   Switzerland will host the final against either the United States
or Spain next September 19-20.
	   Though it was widely expected the 17-year-old would easily
dipose of Mauresmo, ranked 34, several times it appeared Hingis
would disappoint the 8,000 Swiss fans crammed into the Tourbillion
stadium.
	   The Swiss Miss ran into trouble from the start, as the pair
exchanged four consecutive breaks, before failing to convert a
crucial set-point at 5-4.
	   Then leading 4-1 in the tiebreak, Hingis was unable to close
out, allowing instead an impressive Mauresmo to save three
set-points and take a one-set lead.
	   The second set began much the same way, with Mauresmo breaking
Hingis' opening serve to move out to a 3-0 advantage.
	   The tension between Hingis and her mother and team captain
Melanie Molitor during change-overs was clearly visible, the
teenager even flinging a towel back into her mother's face.
	   But then, down 4-1 in front of her home fans, their cowbells
sitting silently at their feet, Hingis' pride and experience came
to the fore, the teenager pulling out all the stops to win the next
five games and the set.
	   Once she'd evened the score, the four-time Grand Slam champion
was not about to let the third set slip through her fingers.
	   Shifting into a higher gear, Hingis immediately broke Mauresmo's
opening serve to jump to a 2-0 lead.
	   As Hingis increased the heat, Mauresmo began to collapse,
allowing the Swiss-sensation to break her again to take a 4-1
advantage.
	   The 19-year-old Mauresmo showed a few last bursts of spirit,
breaking Hingis' serve to decrease the gap to 4-2, but was quickly
broken back on her next service game.
	   The contest marked the first time the two nations met since 1964
when France triumphed 3-0. It also marked Switzerland's first time
in the world group since 1994.
	   Patty Schnyder, the only player to win five tournaments this
year, played France's Julie Halard-Decugis in a dead rubber,
followed by a doubles match between the Swiss pair and France's
Alexandra Fusai and Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat in the
doubles.

Minister accuses Turkey of phony furor over missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS Turkish comment in 7th and 8th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Cypriot minister on Sunday accused
Turkey of trying to wreck the island's economy by creating a furor
over the Greek Cypriots' planned purchase of anti-aircraft
missiles.
	   ``Turkey's objective through the constant threats of the use of
force is to consolidate the occupation of (northern) Cyprus and to
strike at the strength of our economy,'' said Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey's 1974 invasion, which was
sparked by an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized
only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel reiterated warnings Saturday
that Turkey would prevent the planned deployment of the Russian
S-300 missiles.
	   ``Their preparations for military intervention, their missiles,
their bases, their adventurous aspirations will only bring tears
and pain,'' Demirel said during a visit to the Turkish Cypriot
north of the island to mark the 24th anniversary of the Turkish
invasion.
	   In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Sunday the
missiles would threaten not only northern Cyprus but also other
eastern Mediterranean countries, including Turkey, as well as NATO
defense systems.
	   ``With their strong radars, the S-300 command systems _ to be
operated by Russian military personnel together with Greek Cypriot
soldiers _ will control a large area, including the Incirlik air
base,'' Cem said. Incirlik in southern Turkey is used by British
and U.S. jets.

Fighting breaks out after political rally in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with injuries, graf 2

<TEXT>
	   YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of supporters of rival
political parties clashed in a street brawl after a rally Sunday,
police and witnesses said.
	   Two people were hospitalized with stab wounds. There were no
reports of arrests, police said.
	   Several motorcycles and cars were set afire or damaged when
opposing mobs attacked the offices of each others' parties.
	   Earlier, several thousand supporters of opposition figure
Megawati Sukarnoputri staged a noisy but peaceful rally to
commemorate the second anniversary of a bloody 1996 crackdown
against their Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI.
	   Violence broke out after they took to the streets in a convoy of
cars and motorcycles, only to be challenged by members of the rival
Muslim-oriented United Development Party, or PPP.
	   Police said mobs threw rocks. One group tried to set the PDI's
office afire as others attacked the PPP's building across the
street.
	   The trouble in Yogyakarta flared one day before Megawati was due
to hold her own commemoration of the 1996 crackdown in the capital,
Jakarta, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) to the west.
	   Originally, she had planned to conduct her rally in Jakarta's
main sports park.
	   However, police refused to give her permission on security
grounds. About 9,000 troops and police were put on alert despite
assurances from organizers that there would no trouble.
	   Wanting to avoid a confrontation with security forces, rally
organizers announced Sunday that a smaller gathering would go ahead
in the grounds of Megawati's south Jakarta home instead.
	   Megawati has criticized the ban as contrary to government
promises to allow free speech.
	   Armed Forces chief Gen. Wiranto has defended the ban, saying
that the mobilization of protesters in Jakarta could ``entail great
risks,'' the official Antara news agency reported.
	   Two years ago, Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, gained wide popularity after she
criticized the autocratic policies of then President Suharto.
	   That led, however, to her ouster as PDI head in June 1996 by
pro-government rivals within the party.
	   Her supporters protested by occupying the party's Jakarta
headquarters. But on July 27, the military and police staged a
predawn raid on the building.
	   The assault triggered major riots in which at least five people
were killed and dozens of others were reported missing.
	   The political fortunes of Megawati and other opposition figures
have risen following the resignation of Suharto in May after
Indonesia was rocked by more protests and riots amid the worst
economic crisis in 30 years.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised to reform
the tightly controlled political system and to hold free elections
next year.

Hingis battles to send Swiss to finals

	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ World No. 1 Martina Hingis labored to a
three-set comeback win over Amelie Mauresmo at the Federation Cup
world group semifinals on Sunday, giving Switzerland an unbeatable
3-0 lead over defending champion France.
	   With her hard-fought 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-2 victory over Mauresmo,
Hingis led the tiny alpine nation to its first world group final
ever.
	   Switzerland will host the final against either the United States
or Spain on Sept. 19-20.
	   Though it was widely expected the 17-year-old would easily
dispose of Mauresmo, ranked 34, it appeared several times as though
Hingis would disappoint the 8,000 Swiss fans crammed into the
Tourbillion stadium.

Palestinian negotiator: Israel presented new ideas in secret talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister met secretly with a
Yasser Arafat's top deputy and presented new ideas for budging the
stalled peace process, a top Palestinian negotiator said Sunday.
	   Saeb Erekat said the two sides had agreed to keep those ideas
secret for now.
	   Palestinian leaders were to meet late Sunday night in the Gaza
Strip to discuss the proposals, he told The Associated Press.
	   Avi Beniyahu, spokesman for Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai,
confirmed that Mordechai had met Saturday night with Mahmoud Abbas,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's top deputy.
	   Beniyahu said the two had agreed that negotiations would resume
shortly, and Israel's Army Radio said talks would resume on Monday.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have been deadlocked over an overdue
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Israel has rejected an American initiative, widely reported but
never formally unveiled, calling for it to withdraw from another
13.1 percent of the West Bank. Arafat has accepted the proposal.
	   Last week the two sides held their first high-level face-to-face
meetings in months at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, but the talks concluded with both sides asking
the United States to step in again.
	   U.S. officials, however, have indicated that the two sides need
to work out their differences themselves before the Americans
become involved again.
	   Abbas was scheduled to meet Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani on Monday, but the two were to discuss smaller,
day-to-day problems rather than the troop pullback terms.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman warned Sunday that the situation
was approaching an ``explosion.''
	   ``The two sides _ the Palestinians and we _ are approaching a
moment when we will have no choice but to do something,'' he told
Israel Radio. ``Otherwise, there will soon be _ maybe it's a harsh
word _ some kind of explosion.''
	   Weizman, whose position is largely ceremonial, repeated his call
for early elections because of the stalemate in the peace process.
	   ``There is a need for a shakeup,'' he said.
	   Also Sunday, dozens of peace activists demonstrated at
intersections around Israel, calling on Netanyahu to go ahead with
the West Bank troop withdrawal.

Controversial and colorful tycoon Roland ``Tiny'' Rowland dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with background and details on his life;
Adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Controversial and colorful tycoon Roland ``Tiny''
Rowland, who turned an unprofitable company in Rhodesia into a
multi-billion pound (dollar) international conglomerate, has died
at the age of 80.
	   Rowland had been suffering from skin cancer and died at the
London Clinic, announced the Observer newspaper, which Rowland
owned for 13 years, until 1992.
	   The former head of Lonrho Plc built a personal fortune estimated
by the British media at 150 million pounds (dlrs 250 million),
owned homes in Britain and Mexico and a yacht in the Mediterranean,
the Hansa, where he was vacationing with his family when he became
ill last week.
	   A spokesman for Lonrho Africa, a separate company that holds
Lonrho's trading interests in much of Africa, said he died Friday.
	   A truly international figure, Rowland was born in India of
German and Dutch stock and made his reputation as an entrepreneur
in Africa after World War II, calling himself a ``revolutionary
capitalist.''
	   He started by buying two farms in Rhodesia, then branched into
mining and in 1963 became chief executive of the money-losing
London and Rhodesian Mining and Land Company.
	   Recognizing that independence was in the wind, he realized the
continent's newly independent countries would need industrial and
commercial know-how.
	   Over the next 30 years, he turned Lonrho into a multi-mix
conglomerate with more than 1,000 subsidiaries in over 60 countries
_ including manufacturing companies, hotels, publishing, textiles,
sugar estates, vineyards, oil, gas and shipping interests, property
and cattle.
	   ``He believed in the massive resources of Africa and believed
that a British company could make a lot of money by associating
itself with it,'' former Observer editor Donald Trelford told Sky
Television News. ``He got to know all the African leaders. He was
on close personal terms. That was how he worked _ and he achieved
it.''
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, who gave Rowland the
country's highest award, the Order of Good Hope, for his
contribution to peace and prosperity, told The Observer Rowland was
``a tremendous friend to the whole country'' and his death was a
shock.
	   ``He made an enormous contribution, not only to South Africa but
to the whole of Africa,'' Mandela was quoted as saying. ``We will
remember him as a longstanding friend in the struggle against
apartheid.''
	   Kenneth Kaunda, former president of Zambia and another longtime
friend, was quoted as saying: ``He was a man full of compassion. He
had love for fellow human beings. We worked together to empower
Africans economically since the Seventies. He is a great loss to
us. A terrible loss.''
	   But Rowland's unconventional, individualistic style led to
prolonged legal and political battles as well as brilliant business
deals _ and he had enemies.
	   For much of the last 15 years he waged a bitter campaign against
Mohamed Al Fayed, the Egyptian businessman who defeated him in the
takeover battle for the department store chain House of Fraser,
including London landmark Harrods. He claimed the former
Conservative government approved Al Fayed's 1985 takeover of House
of Fraser with too little official investigation into his assets
and background.
	   Some estimates put the cost of Rowland's vendetta against Al
Fayed at 25 million pounds (dlrs 41 million).
	   Rowland retired in 1995 after being ousted as head of Lonrho in
a power struggle with Dieter Bock, his joint chief executive.
Rowland had initially tapped Bock as a successor, but the two soon
began feuding.
	   Trelford blamed Rowland's ``obsession'' with Al Fayed for
distorting ``his business judgment'' and forcing his ouster from
Lonrho.
	   Roland ``Tiny'' Rowland was born Roland Walter Fuhrhop in
November 1917 in India, where his father Wilhelm Fuhrhop, a German
from a respected merchant family in Hamburg, was working for the
family business. His mother, Muriel Carton, was English-born of
Dutch stock.
	   He was believed to have been given the nickname ``Tiny'' by a
nanny as he shot towards his eventual height of 6 feet 2 inches
(1.88 meters).
	   At he end of World War I, the family returned to Hamburg. In his
teens, Rowland joined the Hitler Youth, but his father became known
as an anti-Nazi and the family moved to England.
	   After finishing his education at Churcher's College, an English
boarding school, he started working for an uncle in the shipping
business. During a business trip to Germany, he spent eight weeks
in a Gestapo jail because of his association with two well-known
anti-Nazis.
	   In 1939, he changed his surname to that of his uncle _ Rowland _
and was conscripted into the British Army. But, because of his
German background, he was barred from combat and served with the
Royal Army Medical Corps in Norway and Scotland.
	   Before the outbreak of the war, his father returned to England
but was interned on the Isle of Man. Rowland's constant efforts to
win his father's release led to an ultimatum that he stop badgering
authorities about his father. He did not, was discharged from the
army in 1942 and interned himself on the Isle of Man.
	   His father remained interned until the end of the war, but
Rowland was released after nine months. His two brothers, who
remained in Germany, died during the war.
	   After the war, Rowland spent a short time in England, buying and
selling factories, and then decided to make a fresh start in a new
continent.
	   He is survived by his wife, Josie, whom he met in Rhodesia _ now
Zimbabwe _ and by a son and three daughters.
	   Family friend Paul Spicer said the funeral would be private.

Police: Cyanide caused deaths of five people in apparent suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Three women and two teen-age girls who were
found dead in an apartment last week in an apparent suicide pact
died of cyanide poisoning, police reported Sunday.
	   A statement said initial results of a toxicological examination
showed the cyanide, but police have not yet classified the deaths
as suicide.
	   Police said there were were no signs of struggle when the bodies
were found last Thursday.
	   Suicide notes, believed to have been written by women, saying
they were unhappy with their marriages and love affairs, were found
in the apartment, police said.
	   A pair of black scissors tied to a wok with red strings was
found hanging from a window, a symbol used by superstitious Chinese
to ward off evil spirits.
	   Police have discounted press reports that the deaths were
related to a religious cult. The three women reportedly had an
interest in fengshui, or geomancy, because such paraphernalia as
the wok and a special mirror were found in the apartment.
	   The three women were identified as divorcee Tsui Shun-kam, 40,
owner of the apartment; businesswoman Lam Chun-lai, 49, and Choi
Sau-chun, 44. The two teen-agers, Lee Ying-fai, 17, and Lee
Ying-hei, 13, were the daughters of Tsui.
	   Police said Choi and Lam had withdrawn a total of about 1
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 128,205) from their banks
shortly before their deaths.
	   Husbands of two of the women reported their wives missing last
Tuesday. One of them found the decomposing bodies by calling his
wife's friends and leading police to the apartment in Hong Kong's
Kowloon Bay district.

New land mines hampering U.N. bid to probe massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The U.N. mission overseeing Angola's
peace process said Sunday that new land mines were hampering its
attempts to investigate a massacre in which up to 200 villagers are
believed to have been killed recently in an attack blamed on the
former rebel group UNITA.
	   The number of people slain in the attack, which took place
Tuesday in the small diamond mining village of Bula, about 250
miles (400 kilometers) east of Luanda, could not yet be accurately
assessed, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst, said.
	   Government sources indicated 215 people have been killed and 70
wounded. Initial reports put the figure at closer to 100.
	   The U.N. Observer Mission in Angola, or MONUA, has tried to send
in a team to analyze the circumstances under which the attack
occurred, but has been delayed because of the fresh land mines in
the surrounding area, Wimhurst explained.
	   Survivors allege the attackers were from UNITA, but the former
guerilla group, which signed a peace pact with the government in
1994 to end a two-decade civil war, has denied the accusations.
	   ``The massacre is a result of antagonism between national and
foreign groups of illegal diamond miners,'' UNITA said in a
statement.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ runs diamond-mining operations in
Lunda Norte, where Bula is located. The diamonds provide the
movement with hundreds of millions of dollars annually, analysts
say.
	   The United Nations has banned UNITA's diamond exports as part of
sanctions that came into force when the group failed to abide by
terms of the 1994 peace plan.

Hakkinen in McLaren wins Austrian Grand Prix
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SPIELBERG, Austria (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen of Finland charged to
the front from the start and survived an accident-filled Austrian
Grand Prix Sunday to win his fifth Formula One race of the season
in his McLaren-Mercedes.
	   Hakkinen's victory increased his lead in the drivers' standings
to nine points over Michael Schumacher, with six races left in the
season.
	   Schumacher, Hakkinen's closest rival who had won the last three
races, lost the nose cone of his Ferrari when he swerved off the
track but battled back in a damaged car to take third place.
	   But Schumacher appeared to be helped by Ferrari teammate Eddie
Irvine of Ireland, who slowed noticeably over several laps to allow
the German to finally pass him with three laps left in the 71-lap
race over the 4.6-kilometer (2.3-mile) A1-Ring.
	   Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David Coulthard of Britain finished
second, the fourth time the McLaren drivers placed in that order
this season.
	   Irvine drove the second Ferrari to fourth place.

Philippines agrees with U.S. on forces accord, Japan on ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Filipino women protested Sunday
against an accord that would bring U.S. forces back to the islands,
while U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sought assurances
from government leaders that the agreement would pass the Senate.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada also received assurances
from Keizo Obuchi, the man expected to become Japan's new prime
minister next week, that development assistance would continue and
the two countries' ties would grow closer.
	   The high-level meetings occurred on the sidelines of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum.
	   Estrada said he sought Obuchi's support for his administration's
efforts to improve the lives of impoverished Filipinos in the
southern region of Mindanao. Parts of Mindanao rank among the
country's worst economic backwaters due to a Muslim separatist
struggle that has raged for three decades.
	   One thrust of Japan's substantial development assistance to the
Philippines has been Mindanao, which has also been particularly
hard hit by a drought caused by the El Nino weather condition.
	   Obuchi ``assured me that under his leadership, he will establish
a very close relationship with the Philippines,'' Estrada told
reporters after meeting the Japanese foreign minister at the
presidential palace. ``Whatever help we will need, he will
support.''
	   Estrada won the May 11 presidential elections by a wide margin
on a pro-poor platform.
	   In a separate meeting, Albright sought assurances from
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon that the
Visiting Forces Agreement, allowing resumption of joint
U.S.-Philippine military exercises, would pass the country's
Senate.
	   Siazon said that was his wish as well as Estrada's, said a
senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity.
	   Meanwhile, about 50 women, carrying placards with anti-U.S.
slogans and yelling, ``Never again!'' protested outside the steel
gates of the seaside Manila Hotel where Albright and Siazon were
meeting.
	   One of the protesters, Janice Monte of the left-wing women's
movement called Gabriela, said that a return of U.S. troops would
promote more prostitution of women and children in the country, as
when American bases were open north of Manila.
	   Other left-wing groups have said they would hound Albright with
protests until she leaves the country Wednesday.
	   The proposed accord provides certain legal protections for U.S.
troops while in the Philippines, a change that will allow military
exercises to resume.
	   The United States halted all joint exercises on Philippine
territory and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when
the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S.
military personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes
committed here.
	   Filipino senators voted against a treaty renewing the lease of
the last U.S. military base in the Philippines, at Subic Bay, north
of Manila, in 1991. The base closed a year later, ending nearly a
century of U.S. military presence in this former American colony.
	   The two countries used to conduct six to eight military
exercises a year, involving up to 3,000 U.S. troops at a time.

	   Hakkinen lost the lead only briefly once to Coulthard following
a pit stop.
	   Coulthard, who was 14th on the starting grid, had to make an
early pit stop following a series of crashes in the opening lap.
But he zoomed through the field to finish second.
	   The safety car went out already in the first lap following
several collisions. The most prominent victim was Mika Salo of
Finland in an Arrows-Yamaha, whose spinning car bumped into
Coulthard.
	   By that time, Hakkinen and Schumacher, starting from the second
row, had sped to the front of the field, having overtaken Giancarlo
Fisichella of Italy in a Benetton, who had started in pole, and
Jean Alesi of France in a Sauber.
	   Schumacher tried twice to overtake Hakkinen in the early going,
but the Finn stayed ahead. Schumacher lost the second place briefly
when he braked too late coming into a curve in the first attempt to
overtake, but quickly regained the second spot from Fisichella.
	   However, there was more trouble for the German on lap 18, when
he swerved out in a corner, hit the gravel hard and lost the nose
cone of his Ferrari.
	   The German went into the box and returned to the track, but was
trailing 16th and had a long way to catch up.
	   Another crash on lap 22 took out Fisichella and Alesi, after
Fisichella had bumped into the Frenchman's Petronas-Sauber
following a pit stop.

Kuerten rallies to win Mercedes Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten Sunday swept
to his first title since the 1997 French Open and just the second
of his career when he edged Karol Kucera in three sets at the
Mercedes Open.
	   Kuerten, pouncing on the Slovakian's weak second serve, came
from a break down in the final set to win, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 at the
dlrs 1.04 million event.
	   The 21-year-old had emerged from nowhere to capture last year's
French Open, becoming the first Brazilian to win a Grand Slam.
	   Kuerten has admitted he had trouble living up to expectations
after that triumph. Since then his best performances were reaching
two finals in 1997.
	   ``It's not like I completely disappeared this year,'' said
Kuerten, ranked 28th. ``I've reached a few semifinals. I've just
had to be patient until my game got better again.''
	   Kuerten had ousted the current French Open champion, Spain's
Carlos Moya, in the first semifinal Saturday.
	   Kucera spoiled Marcelo Rios' bid to take over the No. 1 ranking
in the second, beating the Chilean when a victory would have lifted
the world No. 2 past Pete Sampras on the ATP computer.
	   Kucera jumped to a 4-0 lead against Kuerten in just 17 minutes
during a match which saw few long rallies, with both players
gambling on winners.
	   But Kuerten, who fell behind early in all his matches at the
event, began to slam backhand winners off the world No. 11 as he
slowly took control of the match.
	   He also began to land his serve, yielding just three points in
four service games as he easily captured the second set.
	   Kuerten took home dlrs 279,000 for the title, while Kucera
earned dlrs 146,000 while reaching the final for the second
straight year.
	   The Slovakian, who has won three tournaments, was beaten last
year by Spain's Alex Corretja.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Hopes that a highway standoff between
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and Myanmar's military government
would end Sunday evaporated as she prepared to spend a third night
in her car.
	   ``She is free to return to Yangon anytime, but she cannot
proceed to her destination,'' said a military officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity as he accompanied reporters to the scene.
	   Suu Kyi was stopped Friday morning 51 kilometers (32 miles) west
of the capital while driving to Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles)
west of Yangon, to meet members of her political party.
	   In her battle to bring democracy to Myanmar, Suu Kyi has tried
three times in recent weeks to break away from her military
security detail and drive out to the provinces to meet supporters.
	   She has been stopped by the government each time.
	   ``We hope that it will end today,'' Tin Oo, vice chairman of the
National League for Democracy, of which Suu Kyi is general
secretary, said Sunday of the standoff.
	   NLD officials had said on the second day the government put
barbed wire barricades, sand bags and soldiers around Suu Kyi's
white sedan.
	   None were visible late Sunday. Suu Kyi's vehicle was parked on a
wooden bridge off the main road. A group of local authorities,
plainclothes security personnel and an ambulance stood by.
	   The government said in a statement faxed to Bangkok: ``It is
their own rigid and confrontational policy which has made them
spend the night in the car.''
	   Tin Oo said he thought the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner would
return home if the military let her party members come to Yangon.
	   On two previous trips on July 7 and 20, a compromise was reached
where the military brought people Suu Kyi was attempting to see to
her car.
	   During the first trip, more than 30 soldiers lifted Suu Kyi's
car with her inside it, and turned it around to face Yangon.
	   The government said Suu Kyi ``has been free to generally move
about and agitate against the government as she ever has. But of
course there are limits just as there are anywhere as to how much
unrest a person or an organization may stir up.''
	   The military has cited no law that Suu Kyi is breaking by
traveling outside the capital to meet members of her party, which
is a legal organization in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Suu Kyi has been traveling to tell party members not to obey a
military order to report to authorities twice a day under the
``Habitual Offenders Act,'' a law reserved for those considered
heinous criminals by the government.

Havel undergoes abdominal surgery to restore his digestive tract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel
underwent three-hour abdominal surgery Sunday, designed to restore
his digestive tract after he suffered a ruptured colon earlier this
year.
	   The operation was performed by Prof. Ernst Bodner, chief surgeon
at the Innsbruck University hospital in Austria. He was invited to
Prague by Havel and his wife.
	   ``The operation went quite well without any complications or
surprises,'' Bodner said at a nationally televised, live press
conference shortly after the surgery was completed.
	   In April, the 61-year-old Havel was rushed to a surgical ward in
Innsbruck from the nearby Alps resort where he was vacationing,
after doctors diagnosed a ruptured colon and acute peritonitis.
	   Some 35 centimeters (14 inches) of Havel's colon had to be
removed during the operation performed then by Bodner and an
excretory duct was inserted.
	   Sunday's operation was designed to remove the excretory duct and
reconnect Havel's large intestine to the rest of the digestive
tract.
	   According to Bodner more of Havel's colon had to be removed
Sunday to make sure the quality of his digestive tract plagued by
diverticulitias is good enough to function without the extretory
duct.
	   ``I was impressed by the performance of the doctors,'' said
Havel's wife Dagmar who was present throughout the surgery. She
likened the team's precision work to a ''Swiss clock''.
	   There were no immediate forecasts as to how long Havel will take
to recover. But he is expected to stay out of public political
action for the rest of the summer.
	   Havel, long a chain-smoker, has had numerous health problems
linked to lung cancer. This is the fifth time he has been
hospitalized since December 1996, when he had one-third of his
right lung and a tumor removed.

Newspapers, radio say new missile for defensive purposes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's new medium-range missile will prevent
any country from forcing its will on the Islamic republic, Iranian
papers said Sunday.
	   ``One of the basic principles of the Islamic revolution is to be
independent and not accept the hegemony of any power,'' the
English-language Tehran Times said in an editorial.
	   Iran's defense minister, Rear Adm. Ali Shamkhani, announced
Saturday that Iran had successfully tested the Shahab-3 missile.
	   He said it has a range of 1,300 kilometers (800 miles). That
would allow Iran to target archenemy Israel or U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia.
	   Iran News daily, in an editorial Sunday, said neighboring
governments have nothing to fear.
	   ``Iran's relations with the neighboring states are so warm and
cordial that these countries are not concerned with Iranian
missiles,'' the paper said. ``Rather, they consider them weapons to
defend their interests.''
	   The paper said that Iran's military budget was among the lowest
in region and that most of its allocations were for defensive
purposes.
	   ``To create any propaganda about the defense capability of Iran
does not help to establish stability and security in the region and
is actually considered a clear interference in Iran's domestic
affairs,'' state-run Iranian radio said.
	   Israel and the United States have expressed concern about the
missile test.
	   In his announcement Saturday, Shamkhani said the missile was
tested Wednesday by Iranian experts ``without any foreign
support.''
	   U.S. intelligence agencies identified the missile as the
Shahab-3 and said that its launch and path were tracked early
Wednesday.
	   The Shahab-3 is believed based on North Korea's No Dong missile,
but it remains unclear if Iran purchased equipment or technology
from the North Koreans.
	   Reports from Washington indicate that the CIA believed Iran was
getting substantial missile technology from Russia and some from
China.

Death toll in East Java flooding rises to 14: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Six more bodies have been found in a
river, bringing to 14 the death toll in floods in the East Java
town of Kediri, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Torrential rain caused the Supit Urang River in Kediri, about
630 kilometers (390 miles) east of Jakarta, to overflow its banks
Thursday.
	   Seven sand miners and a woman were found dead earlier after
being swept away by the flood.
	   The daily Suara Pembaruan reported that the last six bodies were
found Saturday.
	   Also last week, three days of incessant rain had caused floods
and landslides in the districts of Yapen Waropen and Abepura in
remote Irian Jaya province, killing 12 people. One other remained
missing.
	   Scores of people were also reported injured.

Malaysian minister lights poison-pen letter bonfire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In the name of national security,
Malaysia's information minister on Sunday set fire to heaps of hate
mail penned about the country's leadership, a news report said.
	   ``This culture of writing and circulating poison-pen letters has
to be stopped as it is detrimental to national security,''
Information Minister Mohamad Rahmat said as he lit a bonfire of
letters that filled four garbage pails at a divisional headquarters
of the ruling United Malays National Organization party in Pulai,
in the southern state of Johor.
	   A police investigation would be launched to trace the letters
and punish those responsible for circulating them, Mohamad was
quoted as saying by the government-owned Bernama news agency. He
added that the government was not clamping down on freedom of
expression.
	   No details about the letters were provided except that they
discredited the national leadership.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has often been a victim of
privately circulated poison-pen letters alleging abuse of power and
sexual misconduct.
	   On the eve of the annual UMNO general assembly last month, many
delegates received a book called ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be
Prime Minister.''
	   Anwar obtained a court injunction barring distribution of the
book, which he said contained allegations including illicit sex,
bribery and attempts to undermine the country's leadership. He
threatened to ``teach the authors a lesson.''

Palestinian negotiator: Israel presented new ideas in secret talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister met secretly with
Yasser Arafat's top deputy and presented new ideas for sparking the
stalled peace process, a top Palestinian negotiator said Sunday.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the two sides had agreed
to keep those ideas secret for now.
	   Palestinian leaders were to meet late Sunday night in the Gaza
Strip to discuss the proposals, he told The Associated Press.
	   Avi Beniyahu, spokesman for Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai,
confirmed that Mordechai had met Saturday night with Mahmoud Abbas,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's top deputy.
	   Beniyahu said the two had agreed that negotiations would resume
shortly. Israel's Army Radio said talks would resume on Monday.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have been deadlocked over an overdue
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Israel has rejected an American initiative, widely reported but
never formally unveiled, calling for it to withdraw from another
13.1 percent of the West Bank. Arafat has accepted the proposal.
	   Last week the two sides held their first high-level face-to-face
meetings in months at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, but the talks concluded with both sides asking
the United States to step in again.
	   U.S. officials, however, have indicated that the two sides need
to work out their differences themselves before the Americans
become involved again.
	   Abbas was scheduled to meet Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani on Monday, but the two were to discuss smaller,
day-to-day problems rather than the troop pullback terms.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman warned Sunday that the situation
was getting dangerous.
	   ``The two sides _ the Palestinians and we _ are approaching a
moment when we will have no choice but to do something,'' he told
Israel Radio. ``Otherwise, there will soon be _ maybe it's a harsh
word _ some kind of explosion.''
	   Weizman, whose position is largely ceremonial, repeated his call
for early elections because of the stalemate in the peace process.
	   ``There is a need for a shakeup,'' he said.
	   Also Sunday, dozens of peace activists demonstrated at
intersections around Israel, calling on Netanyahu to proceed with
the West Bank troop withdrawal.

Iran denies executing member of Baha'i sect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 6th graf with U.S. officials unavailable for
comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran denied Sunday that it had executed a
member of the Baha'i sect and described reports of his hanging as
``a total lie,'' Iranian television reported.
	   Earlier this month, the United States and the United Nations
condemned Iran for allegedly executing Ruhollah Rowhani after he
was charged with converting to the Baha'i faith from Islam.
	   ``Essentially, none of the branches of the court has issued a
death sentence for a person named Ruhollah Rowhani, affiliated to
the Baha'i sect. The report of his execution is a total lie,'' the
state-run television quoted the head of the Islamic Revolution
Court, Judge Gholamhossein Rahbarpur, as saying.
	   He also said none of Iran's provincial courts had issued such a
sentence, the television said.
	   The broadcast accused the West of ``widespread propaganda'' over
the case.
	   The U.S. state department did not immediately return phone calls
seeking comment.

Cambodian leader says he ran better polls than United Nations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAHKMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Accused before Cambodia's elections of
using violence and intimidation to ensure victory, strongman Hun
Sen came out swinging Sunday and said the new polls were much
better organized than the dlrs 3 billion elections run by the
United Nations five years ago.
	   The biggest legacy of the U.N. mission, meant to usher in peace
and democracy after decades of war and genocide, was to introduce
AIDS to Cambodia via the 20,000 peacekeeping troops and other
officials sent here, Hun Sen said.
	   After casting his ballot in the parliamentary elections near his
home, Hun Sen declared: ``I can say that the Cambodian people have
already won, and I share their victory.''
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC finished atop the vote
organized by the U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia in 1993,
but Hun Sen forced his way into a co-premiership by threatening
civil war. Last year, Hun Sen, who first came to power in 1985
under Vietnam's military occupation, deposed Ranariddh in a violent
takeover.
	   The current elections, organized by Cambodians, most of them Hun
Sen supporters, cost just dlrs 34 million, a fraction of the 1993
price tag. Hun Sen noted there was no need this time for heavy
weapons to guard the polling stations.
	   The biggest difference is that the murderous Khmer Rouge, in
1993 still a powerful force, is now virtually extinct.
	   ``UNTAC used troops, armored personnel carriers, machine guns to
guard polling stations,'' Hun Sen said. ``As you might have seen,
there are no guns, even my bodyguards didn't carry any. Compared
with 1993, there is a big difference.''
	   After years of simmering tensions between the coalition leaders,
Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in two days of fighting
last year and chased him into exile.
	   Hun Sen called for new elections to be held Sunday to restore
legitimacy and aid lost after his power grab, and allowed Ranariddh
and other opposition politicians to return to participate.
	   Critics accused Hun Sen of rigging the process in his favor by
using intimidation and killings against his opponents, seizing
control of the electoral machinery, and denying his challengers
access to the electronic media.
	   Hun Sen said Sunday that the U.N. mission, which gave Cambodia
its most democratic election in history until that time, did little
good. Its real legacy, he said, was bringing AIDS to Cambodia.
Rates of infection and deaths are currently soaring.
	   ``They treated us badly, we can hardly recall any good points,''
Hun Sen said.

U.N. teams investigates Israeli practices in Palestinian areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A U.N. fact-finding mission began holding
hearings here Sunday on Israeli practices in the occupied
territories.
	   The United Nations said in a statement the three-person team
will travel to the Allenby Bridge on Monday to interview
Palestinians who have just crossed the Jordan River from the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
	   The mission _ headed by Sri Lankan ambassador to the United
Nations, John de Saram _ arrived in Jordan late Saturday for a
three-day visit.
	   It gathered testimony from Palestinians in Egypt last week and
plans to hold hearings in Syria after it leaves Jordan. In Syria,
it will try to interview Arabs with first-hand experience of life
in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967
Arab-Israeli War and subsequently annexed.
	   Israel has always refused to allow such missions to enter the
territories.
	   The mission, officially called the Special Committee to
Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the
Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories,
will report to the U.N. General Assembly.
	   The other two members of the mission are Malaysian
ambassador-at-large Mohammed Abdul Majid and the Senegalese
ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Absa Claude Diallo.

Myanmar seen as not reforming during ASEAN discussions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. official quoting Philippine minister as
saying other ASEAN members share view Myanmar not reforming. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo ASEAN101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Myanmar's foreign minister has been
enduring some tough talk from his Southeast Asian counterparts due
to the lack of progress on political and economic reform during the
past year, a senior U.S. official said Sunday.
	   The United States, the European Union and many international
human rights agencies opposed Myanmar's admission to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations last year, but supporters
argued that they could help it change.
	   Washington's view is that in the past year, the military junta
ruling Myanmar has regressed in dealing with economic problems and
its crackdown on dissidents, a senior U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, told reporters.
	   He said that in a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, the Philippine foreign secretary said that ``many ASEAN
members share that view as well.''
	   The official quoted Domingo Siazon, host to a two-day meeting of
ASEAN foreign ministers, as saying the Myanmar officials ``have
been having a lot of tough discussions.''
	   Myanmar Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw met earlier Sunday with his
Australian counterpart, Alexander Downer, who said he received
``pretty negative'' responses to pressure for the Yangon government
to introduce democratic reforms.
	   Myanmar's military government has been internationally
criticized for widespread human rights abuses and for refusing
reconciliation with the National League for Democracy led by Aung
San Suu Kyi.
	   Tensions have risen over Suu Kyi's Aug. 21 deadline for the
convening of the national assembly that was elected in 1990, but
not recognized by the government.
	   Downer said he told Ohn Gyaw of Australia's ``serious concerns''
about the lack of dialogue with Suu Kyi's party, human rights
violations, and the lack of progress in the drafting of a new
constitution that the Myanmar government has said must be completed
before it yields power.
	   Ohn Gyaw's responses were not promising, Downer said.
	   ``I was told that the constitutional process was going ahead
inch by inch,'' Downer said. ``It seemed to be a very appropriate
way of putting it. I made the point that over the last 12 months
since I met Ohn Gyaw in Kuala Lumpur that nothing seems to have
happened.''
	   Downer said he proposed that Myanmar follow the example of
Indonesia under former President Suharto and establish an
independent human rights commission.
	   Ohn Gyaw ``did not respond in a negative way to that particular
proposal,'' Downer said without elaborating.

Havel undergoes abdominal surgery to repair digestive tract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel
underwent three-hour abdominal surgery Sunday designed to repair
his digestive tract after he suffered a ruptured colon earlier this
year.
	   ``The operation went quite well without any complications or
surprises,'' said Prof. Ernst Bodner, chief surgeon at the
Innsbruck University hospital in Austria, who performed the surgery
in Prague.
	   The 61-year-old Havel was rushed in April to an Austrian
hospital from the nearby Alps resort where he was vacationing after
doctors diagnosed a ruptured colon and acute peritonitis.
	   Some 35 centimeters (14 inches) of Havel's colon had to be
removed during the operation.
	   Sunday's operation was designed, among other things, to
reconnect Havel's large intestine to the rest of his digestive
tract.
	   According to Bodner more of Havel's colon had to be removed
Sunday to ensure the integrity of his digestive tract plagued by
diverticulitias.
	   ``I was impressed by the performance of the doctors,'' said
Havel's wife, Dagmar, who was present throughout the surgery. She
likened the team's precision work to a ``Swiss clock''.
	   Doctors did not say how long Havel will take to recover. He is
expected to maintain a low profile for the rest of the summer.
	   Havel, long a chain-smoker, has had numerous health problems
linked to lung cancer. This is the fifth time he has been
hospitalized since December 1996, when he had one-third of his
right lung and a tumor removed.

Illegal immigrants fight over food; Italian minister under fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police early Sunday broke up a riot among detained
North Africans fighting over a sandwich on a tiny Sicilian island
as tensions increased over what to do about a flood of illegal
immigrants turning up on Italian shores.
	   The brawl on the tiny island of Lampedusa, where 147 Tunisians
and Moroccans have been held for two weeks while awaiting
processing to be sent back home, brought more attention to the
dilemma of illegal immigration.
	   RAI state radio and TV reported that the North Africans hadn't
had a hot meal in two weeks and only received bars of soap two days
ago. It said the riot began when a Tunisian refused to give up the
sandwich that was distributed to him to another who demanded it.
	   Italian newspapers reported Sunday that the Northern League
opposition party would start gathering signatures in Parliament
Monday on a proposed vote of no-confidence against Interior
Minister Giorgio Napolitano, a key member of Premier Romano Prodi's
center-left Cabinet.
	   Napolitano has promised aid to North African countries if they
will better patrol their coasts to prevent the nightly exodus to
southern Italian islands and shores.
	   But the warm temperatures and calm seas of the past two weeks
have aided the clandestine runs of boats packed with North Africans
seeking jobs in Italy or elsewhere in Europe.
	   Roughly 3,000 people trying to slip in by sea have been found
since July 1.
	   Clandestine arrivals earlier this year by hundreds of Kurdish
refugees from Turkey led to an outcry from Germany, which claimed
Italy was too lax on stopping refugees from reaching Italian shores
and then moving on to northern Europe.
	   Under the European Union's open borders policy, Italy is obliged
to send illegal immigrants home.
	   On July 22, Napolitano told parliament no amnesty was
contemplated that would allow illegal arrivals to stay.

Cork leads and England fight back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITS. Same story ran on sports wire earlier.

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Dominic Cork led a remarkable England
fight back with an outstanding spell of medium pace bowling in the
fourth cricket test against South Africa at Trent Bridge Sunday.
	   After England had conceded a 38-run lead, South Africa struggled
to 169 for six at lunch on the fourth day, with an overall lead of
207 runs.
	   South Africa, resuming on 92 for three, lost Daryll Cullinan
(56), Jonty Rhodes (2) and Shaun Pollock (7) in an eight-over
spell.
	   Only half centuries by Cullinan and skipper Hansie Cronje, 62
not out, has propped the South African second innings as it slumped
to 21 for three on the third day.
	   Cullinan and Cronje shared 98 for the fourth wicket in 136
minutes before Cullinan whipped Angus Fraser to Mark Ramprakash at
square leg.
	   South Africa's second innings collapse _ 2-10 in 14 balls to
Cork _ was compounded by another umpiring error _ Jonty Rhodes
adjudged caught behind off his pad by English umpire Mervyn
Kitchen.
	   The match has so far been dogged by at least five contentious
umpiring decisions between Kitchen and International Cricket
Council's independent umpire, New Zealander Steve Dunne.

U.N. teams investigates Israeli practices in Palestinian areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A U.N. fact-finding mission began holding
hearings in Jordan on Sunday on Israeli practices in the occupied
territories.
	   The United Nations said in a statement that the three-person
team will travel to the Allenby Bridge on Monday to interview
Palestinians who have just crossed the Jordan River from the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
	   The mission, headed by Sri Lankan ambassador to the United
Nations, John de Saram, arrived in Jordan late Saturday for a
three-day visit.
	   It gathered testimony from Palestinians in Egypt last week and
plans to hold hearings in Syria after it leaves Jordan. In Syria,
it will try to interview Arabs with first-hand experience of life
in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967
Arab-Israeli War and subsequently annexed.
	   Israel has always refused to allow such missions to enter the
territories.
	   The mission will report to the U.N. General Assembly.
	   The other two members of the mission are Malaysian
ambassador-at-large Mohammed Abdul Majid and the Senegalese
ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Absa Claude Diallo.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Three 12-meter (40-foot) steel statues
were erected Sunday at the top of one of Sydney's tallest landmarks
as a countdown to the 2000 Olympic Games.
	   The sculptures, each weighing four metric tons and suspended
from the Centrepoint Tower, depict a gymnast in a handstand
position, a Paralympic basketball player and a sprinter.
	   Police evacuated areas surrounding the tower for several hours
early Sunday when the statues were lifted separately to the top of
the tower by helicopter and bolted into place.
	   The sculptures will be lit up at the same time that a countdown
clock to the Sydney Games is installed in September.

Hingis battles to send Swiss to finals

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ World No. 1 Martina Hingis labored to a
three-set comeback win over Amelie Mauresmo at the Federation Cup
world group semifinals on Sunday, giving Switzerland an unbeatable
3-0 lead over defending champions France.
	   With her hard-fought 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-2 victory over Mauresmo,
Hingis led the tiny alpine nation to its first world group final
ever.
	   Switzerland will host the final against either the United States
or Spain next September 19-20.
	   Though it was widely expected the 17-year-old would easily
dipose of Mauresmo, ranked 34, several times it appeared Hingis
would disappoint the 8,000 Swiss fans crammed into the Tourbillion
stadium.
	   ``It was very tough,'' said Hingis, in her first tournament
since she was eliminated in the semifinals at Wimbledon. ``Amelie
played a tough match.
	   ``I was suprised by the way she played. I used to wonder with
what she beat the other girls. Today I found out.''
	   The Swiss Miss ran into trouble from the start, as the pair
exchanged four consecutive breaks. Hingis then failed to convert a
crucial set-point at 5-4.
	   Then, leading 4-1 in the tiebreak, Hingis was unable to close
out, allowing instead an impressive Mauresmo to save three
set-points and take a one-set lead.
	   The second set began much the same way, with Mauresmo breaking
Hingis' opening serve to move out to a 3-0 advantage.
	   The tension between Hingis and her mother and team captain
Melanie Molitor during change-overs was clearly visible, the
teenager even flinging a towel back into her mother's face.
	   But then, down 4-1 in front of her home fans, their cowbells
sitting silently at their feet, Hingis' pride and experience came
to the fore, the teenager pulling out all the stops to win the next
five games and the set.
	   Once she'd evened the score, the four-time Grand Slam champion
was not about to let the third set slip through her fingers.
	   Shifting into a higher gear, Hingis immediately broke Mauresmo's
opening serve to jump to a 2-0 lead.
	   As Hingis increased the heat, Mauresmo began to collapse,
allowing the Swiss-sensation to break her again to take a 4-1
advantage.
	   The 19-year-old Mauresmo showed a few last bursts of spirit,
breaking Hingis' serve to decrease the gap to 4-2, but was quickly
broken back on her next service game.
	   ``It's great to be down 7-6, 4-1 and still win the match,''
joked Hingis at a press conference following the match. ``It was
very frustrating at first.
	   ``I think everybody understood what was being said on the bench
even if they didn't speak Czech, but it's better that they don't
know exactly what was said...''
	   The contest marked the first time the two nations met since 1964
when France triumphed 3-0. It is also Switzerland's first time in
the world group since 1994.
	   Patty Schnyder, the only player to win five tournaments this
year, later played France's Julie Halard-Decugis in a dead rubber,
followed by a doubles match between the Swiss pair and France's
Alexandra Fusai and Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat in the
doubles.

Senator among those swept up in loan crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An ill Pakistani senator has been
targeted in a crackdown on loan defaulters, according to news
reports Sunday.
	   Associated Press of Pakistan, citing federal investigators,
reported that Senator Islamuddin Shaikh was among 14 people in
several cities across Pakistan charged in loan cases over the
weekend.
	   The news agency said federal investigators armed with lists of
people state banks had identified as chronic defaulters set out to
recover more than 3 billion rupees (about dlrs 5 million), a
fraction of the total believed lost to bad loans over the years.
	   Senator Shaikh had a heart attack last week and had only
recently returned to his Islamabad home when federal investigators
arrived Saturday to inform him of a complaint filed by United Bank,
his son Noman was quoted as telling The News. The newspaper
reported the bank accused Shaikh of defaulting on a 65.5
million-rupee (about dlrs 1.1-million) loan.
	   Noman Shaikh was quoted as saying his father weakened after
learning of the case against him and returned to the hospital.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's decision to test nuclear weapons
in May triggered international economic sanctions that brought to a
head years of fiscal mismanagement. With his country on the verge
of bankruptcy, Sharif ordered the crackdown on Pakistanis who owe
state banks, along with other steps designed to shore up the
economy.
	   Prominent, politically influential Pakistanis have long been
accused of using the state treasury as a source of private funds
they never intended to repay. Some 150 billion rupees (dlrs 2
billion) is believed to have disappeared in bad loans.

Experts defuse U.S.-made bomb at construction site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After evacuating more than 5,000 residents and
stopping nearby train service, Japanese military experts on Sunday
defused a 500-pound U.S.-made bomb believed to have dropped 53
years ago during World War II.
	   Workers found the bomb June 29 while doing drainage work, said
Kunihiko Komachi, a spokesman of the city office in Tachikawa,
about 35 kilometers (21 miles) northwest of Tokyo.
	   Komachi said 5,000 people were evacuated from homes within 300
meters (330 yards) of the site, and the two-hour train service halt
affected 30 trains and about 3,000 people.
	   During the war, he said, a Japanese Imperial Army military
equipment manufacturing plant was believed to have been located at
the site.
	   Masaru Ono, a military spokesman, said seven bomb experts needed
about one hour to defuse the bomb, which was found 1.7 meters (5
1/2 feet) underground.

Hakkinen in McLaren wins Austrian Grand Prix

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, corrects Hakkinen's lead to eight points,
adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPIELBERG, Austria (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen of Finland charged to
the front from the start and stayed out of trouble in an
accident-filled Austrian Grand Prix Sunday to win his fifth Formula
One race of the season.
	   Hakkinen's victory increased his lead in the drivers' standings
to eight points over Michael Schumacher, with six races left in the
season.
	   Schumacher, Hakkinen's closest rival who had won the last three
races, lost the nose cone of his Ferrari when he swerved off the
track but battled back in a damaged car to take third place.
	   But Schumacher appeared to be helped by Ferrari teammate Eddie
Irvine of Ireland, who slowed noticeably over several late laps.
The German finally passed him with three laps left in the 71-lap
race over the 4.6-kilometer (2.3-mile) A1-Ring.
	   Schumacher said Irvine had slowed because of brake problems.
	   ``It's natural that he wouldn't make it very difficult for me,''
Schumacher said. ``We were both slowing down because of brake
problems.''
	   Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes teammate David Coulthard of Britain
finished second, the fourth time the McLaren drivers placed in that
order this season.
	   ``Exactly what we wanted,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Irvine drove the second Ferrari to fourth place.
	   Hakkinen lost the lead only briefly once to Coulthard following
a pit stop.
	   Coulthard, who was 14th on the starting grid, had to make an
early pit stop following a series of crashes in the opening lap.
But he zoomed through the field to finish second.
	   The safety car went out already in the first lap following
several collisions. The most prominent victim was Mika Salo of
Finland in an Arrows-Yamaha, whose spinning car bumped into
Coulthard in the second corner.
	   ``I had to come back into the pits and get a new front wing,''
Coulthard said. ``But I was able to rejoin the field at the back
behind the safety car.''
	   ``It's quite easy to pass when you have a quick car,'' he said.
	   By that time, Hakkinen and Schumacher, starting from the second
row, had sped to the front of the field, having overtaken Giancarlo
Fisichella of Italy in a Benetton, who had started in pole, and
Jean Alesi of France in a Sauber.
	   ``I just put my foot down and I was in the front in the first
corner,'' Hakkinen said.
	   ``I had some brake balance problems at the start of the race and
I was struggling in the corners,'' he said.
	   Schumacher tried twice to overtake Hakkinen in the early going,
but the Finn stayed ahead. Schumacher lost the second place briefly
when he braked too late coming into a curve in the first attempt to
overtake, but quickly regained the second spot from Fisichella.
	   However, there was more trouble for the German on lap 18, when
he swerved out in a corner, hit the gravel hard and lost the nose
cone of his Ferrari.
	   ``It was a stupid mistake, I went off the line and hit the dust,
there was nothing I could do.''
	   ``There was less damage than I thought but there was enough
damage,'' he said.
	   The German went into the box and returned to the track, but was
trailing 16th and had a long way to catch up.
	   Another crash on lap 22 took out Fisichella and Alesi, after
Fisichella had bumped into the Frenchman's Sauber following a pit
stop.
	   Schumacher also had to battle past his brother Ralf in a
Jordan-Mugen Honda, and nearly went off the course again.
	   Ralf Schumacher placed fifth, while defending champion Jacques
Villeneuve of Canada was sixth in his Williams-Mechachrome.
	   Hakkinen covered the race distance of 306.649 kilometers in one
hour, 30 minutes, 44.086 seconds, averaging a speed of 202.777 kph.
	   Coulthard was 5.289 seconds behind, and Schumacher 39.093.
	   By picking up 10 points for his victory, Hakkinen now has 66
points. Schumacher got four points and has a total of 58. Coulthard
kept his third place and now has 36.

Iran denies executing member of Baha'i sect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS State Dept's no response graf 6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran denied Sunday that it had executed a
member of the Baha'i sect and described reports of his hanging as
``a total lie,'' Iranian television reported.
	   Earlier this month, the United States and the United Nations
condemned Iran for allegedly executing Ruhollah Rowhani after he
was charged with converting to the Baha'i faith from Islam.
	   ``Essentially, none of the branches of the court has issued a
death sentence for a person named Ruhollah Rowhani, affiliated to
the Baha'i sect. The report of his execution is a total lie,'' the
state-run television quoted the head of the Islamic Revolution
Court, Judge Gholamhossein Rahbarpur, as saying.
	   He also said none of Iran's provincial courts had issued such a
sentence, the television said.
	   The broadcast accused the West of ``widespread propaganda'' over
the case.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department did not immediately
answer calls seeking comment on Sunday.
	   Under Iran's Islamic Penal Code, apostasy _ abandoning Islam _
is not pardonable, and any citizen can carry out the execution of
someone who converts.
	   The Baha'i religion, with about 5 million followers in 100
countries, is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Some 300,000 Baha'is
live in Iran, where the faith was founded in the 19th century.
	   Iran's religious leaders contend the religion is a heretic cult.
	   International human rights groups repeatedly have condemned Iran
for its repression of religious minorities, particularly the
Baha'is and Christians.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's embattled president, Aslan Maskhadov,
accepted an affirmation of support Sunday from Russia and agreed to
take part in an unusual meeting this week with his erstwhile
enemies.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has ordered Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to demonstrate support
for his government, even though the Chechen president led a
two-year war for independence from Russia.
	   Maskhadov still does not recognize Moscow's rule over his small,
Muslim republic. But he has been hit by a recent onslaught of
violence, culminating in an apparent assassination attempt Thursday
when a car bomb exploded under his motorcade, killing two of his
bodyguards.
	   The Chechen president has agreed to meet with Kiriyenko, and he
plans to use the time to press Moscow to pay out promised economic
support, Maskhadov spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev told the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   A time and location for the meeting has not been set.
	   Despite his fight for independence, Russia considers Maskhadov a
moderate who is trying to rein in lawlessness and keep his
government essentially secular. The Kremlin apparently fears that
if Maskhadov's government falls, a more radical leader could come
to power.
	   Maskhadov declared a state of emergency in Chechnya last month
after a group of gunmen tried to seize the state television center.
Conflicts between various armed gangs, sects and ethnic groups have
flared in recent weeks into open clashes.
	   ``I reaffirm once again that we support the government of
Chechnya and Aslan Maskhadov personally, and if anyone has any
doubts about that he is mistaken,'' Yeltsin said Saturday after
meeting Kiriyenko.
	   Five people have been arrested so far in connection with the car
bomb attack, Deputy Prime Minister Kabek Makhashev told Echo Moscow
radio, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Interfax quoted Magomed Magomadov, the republic's deputy
prosecutor general, as saying ``all these people are citizens of
Chechnya.''

Nuclear tests to be criticized at Asia-major powers security talks

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Social upheavals that could result
from a prolonged Asian economic crisis raised as much concern as
Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests when Asian foreign ministers met
Sunday to discuss regional security with counterparts from outside
powers.
	   The man of the hour was Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi,
soon to be prime minister, who flew to the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations Regional Forum with promises ``for revitalizing the
domestic economy and making a contribution to Asia.''
	   Obuchi, 61, not known for his forceful personality, was
described by a senior U.S. official as ``going out of his way to
say he will be very decisive and dynamic in dealing with the
economic problems.''
	   The official quoted Obuchi as saying, ``I can and I will act. I
will act promptly,'' during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   ``He laid out a fairly comprehensive agenda and said he was
going to move on it very quickly,'' said the senior U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Obuchi said he intended to
follow through on a campaign promise of a dlrs 43 billion tax cut
and a spending stimulus package of about dlrs 71 billion.
	   Earlier in the day, he had told reporters he would choose a
finance minister who could grapple with the bad-debt problems
hanging over Japan's financial sector.
	   In other meetings, Obuchi agreed with Russia that high-level
meetings between the two governments would continue on schedule,
and that aid to the Philippines would not be cut back.
	   On her way to the dialogue, Albright emphasized that Asia's deep
and widespread economic trouble is a security problem.
	   ``We strongly urge reform, but we will also do all we can to
help countries that are being hurt by the crisis and that are
committed to reform,'' she had said Friday in California.
	   Meanwhile, Filipino women protested outside the Manila Hotel
where the meetings were taking place, rallying against an accord
that would bring U.S. forces back to the Philippines in joint
military exercises. There have been no U.S. forces visits since
1996, when the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had
shielded U.S. military personnel from prosecution by the
Philippines for crimes committed locally.
	   Albright sought and received assurances from Philippine Foreign
Secretary Domingo Siazon that the new president wished the accord
to pass the Senate. But left-wing groups have said they would hound
Albright with protests until she leaves Wednesday.
	   Australia and Canada joined the ASEAN foreign ministers in
criticizing India and Pakistan for their recent nuclear tests.
Australia said the Regional Forum should condemn the newest nuclear
states in a statement at the end of the meeting Monday.
	   But the ASEAN ministers have also said they will press long-term
nuclear powers such as the United States and Russia to set an
example with faster progress on disarmament. ASEAN seeks to create
a nuclear weapons free zone in Southeast Asia, including a ban on
ships carrying the arms through international waters.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   They meet annually in the Regional Forum with Australia,
Cambodia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South
Korea, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Russia and the United States.
	   In addition, Britain and Germany are sending representatives
this year to participate in Post-Ministerial Conferences Tuesday
and Wednesday.

Protesters demand apprehension of looters, protection of Chinese

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ More than 1,000 protesters marched to the
Indonesian consulate in Hong Kong Sunday to demand the apprehension
of looters in Indonesia and protection for the Southeast Asian
country's ethnic Chinese.
	   The demonstrators called on the government in Jakarta to stop
human rights abuses and sexual assaults targeting ethnic Chinese,
who often are scapegoats in Indonesia in times of unrest.
	   Marchers carried banners saying, ``Protect human rights. No
violence,'' and ``Punish rapists.''
	   ``Strongly condemn violence in Indonesia. Indonesian government
must stop the violence,'' the protesters chanted during a 15-minute
march from a public park to the consulate.
	   Deputy Consul General Suhadi Salam received the protesters'
petition demanding that President B.J. Habibie apprehend the
looters, curb further violence and protect the Chinese community.
	   Later, several hundred people held a candlelight vigil Sunday
night at a square outside Hong Kong's Cultural Center in Kowloon
Peninsula in memory of ethnic Chinese killed in Indonesia. The
vigil was organized by the Democrats, Hong Kong's largest political
party.
	   The party's chairman, Martin Lee, said earlier he had written to
U.S. President Bill Clinton to express concern. The legislature's
house committee also agreed last week to write to Habibie.
	   Ethnic Chinese were targeted in unrest that wracked Indonesia in
May. The riots and protests culminated in the resignation of its
long-time president, Suharto. Women's groups say gangs committed at
least 168 rapes, and that most of the victims were ethnic Chinese
women and girls.
	   Chinese make up only a tiny fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
people, but some indigenous Indonesians resent their control of
much of the economy.
	   Police said there were 1,200 protesters, although the
organizers, the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese General Association and
the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong
_ a major grassroots party, claimed 3,000 people turned out.
	   Party chairman and lawmaker Tsang Yok-sing said the ethnic
Chinese fear more violence against them is possible next month when
Indonesia celebrates its independence day holiday.
	   The Chinese ``don't know when they'll have a safe home to go
back to. We demand that the Indonesian government take immediate
action to punish the looters and curb the violence,'' Tsang said.
	   ``I was very angry. They're trampling on our human rights,''
said a protester, H.Y. Lee, an Indonesian Chinese who moved to Hong
Kong in 1953. ``This is a country that wants to extinguish the
minority races.''
	   An unidentified person threw several raw eggs above the
consulate entrance, but protest organizers immediately stopped
further acts of vandalism.

Former Prime Minister Bhutto returns to face corruption case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
returned to Pakistan on Sunday to face corruption charges she says
were fabricated by her political enemy, current Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif.
	   Hundreds of supporters shouting anti-Sharif slogans and waving
her Pakistan People's Party's red-black-and-green flag greeted Ms.
Bhutto at the Karachi airport Sunday evening. She flew in from
Dubai, where she had been visiting her three children.
	   Before flying on to the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, where
she is to appear before a special corruption court Monday, Bhutto
told reporters the charges against her were ``all government
propaganda. I have done nothing wrong.''
	   She also said her husband, whom many blame for her downfall, was
innocent.
	   The corruption court had issued an arrest warrant on July 16
after Ms. Bhutto, then still in Dubai, missed a previous court
appearance on charges of failing to declare some of her assets when
she filed election papers last year. The Supreme Court overturned
the arrest order after her attorneys pledged she would appear
Monday.
	   Her lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan said Ms. Bhutto would plead innocent
Monday.
	   Earlier this month, a Swiss Court indicted Ms. Bhutto's husband
Asif Zardari on charges of money laundering and said it was
clearing up details before charging Ms. Bhutto herself.
	   Zardari has been in jail since his wife's government was
dismissed in November 1996 on charges of corruption and ineptitude.
Zardari faces Pakistani charges of corruption as well as murder in
connection with the 1996 shooting death of Ms. Bhutto's estranged
brother, Murtaza. Zardari has denied the charges.
	   Sharif, pledging he would clean up government, swept to power in
elections last year. Once in office, he set out to prove Ms. Bhutto
and her husband took millions of dollars in kickbacks and bribes
and deposited the spoils in Swiss bank accounts.

Kohl views reworked design for Holocaust Memorial; debate
</HEADLINE>
continues &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has promised to decide
on a design for Germany's national Holocaust Memorial before the
fall election, went to see a reworked model by his favored artist,
a government spokesman said Sunday.
	   But whether it will actually be built in Berlin next year as
planned may depend on the outcome of the Sept. 27 election.
	   The designated cultural affairs minister for the opposition
Social Democrats, Michael Naumann, told German television his party
might not abide by Kohl's decision if it succeeds in unseating him.
	   The project has been surrounded in controversy since it was
first conceived more than 10 years ago, with Germans arguing over
its design, location and purpose.
	   Kohl rejected the original design in 1995 as too bombastic,
forcing a new competition. A winner was to be announced this spring
but has been repeatedly delayed, apparently by complaints about the
four finalists.
	   Last week, Kohl promised an announcement before the elections.
	   On Saturday, he stopped at the German Historical Museum in
Berlin for 30 minutes to see New York-based architect Peter
Eisenmann's revised model, known to be Kohl's favorite.
	   The original design by Eisenmann and American sculptor Richard
Serra had envisioned a labyrinthian field of 4,000 concrete pillars
resembling a cemetery.
	   Serra withdrew from the project in June, citing personal and
professional reasons. Eisenmann's scaled-down design, which has yet
to be publicly shown, reportedly is sunken so that visitors on the
edges can get an overview of the entire memorial, and adds a border
of trees.
	   Naumann, who has criticized building any central memorial as too
cold and ``monumental,'' accused Kohl of acting like ``a baroque
prince'' in taking the decision upon himself.
	   Naumann told ZDF television he would like to see a national
documentation center about Nazi genocide instead of a memorial. He
added that the Social Democrats had not decided whether they would
stick with Kohl's decision about the memorial if they win the
election.
	   Michel Friedman, a board member of the Central Council of Jews
in Germany, told ZDF that Germany could use both a memorial and
documentation center.

Nine leading French rugby teams opt out of Euro cup, to join

English

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's nine leading rugby teams have decided to
shun the European Cup and form a new championship with the English,
a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Financial disputes with organizers of the European Rugby Cup
prompted English clubs to opt out, and the leading French clubs
joined them, l'Equipe reported.
	   The sports daily quoted a statement issued Saturday night by the
breakaway French teams, saying they will not participate in the
European Cup and will ``create a new European competition with the
English.''
	   The decision comes a year and a half before the scheduled rugby
cup and just six weeks before the new season begins.
	   The breakaway French clubs include State Francais, Brive,
Bourgoin, Begles-Bordeaux, Pau, Toulouse, Narbonne, Castres and
Perpignan, member of the organization GCPRE.
	   The clubs have also fought French championship plans. The French
Rugby Federation, or FFR, decided to include 24 teams in two groups
next season. The breakaway clubs want between 16 and 20 teams in
the competition.

BayStars trounce Tigers 16-4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Robert Rose went 5-for-5 and drove in five runs as
the Central League's front-running Yokohama BayStars trounced the
Hanshin Tigers 16-4 at Koshien Stadium Sunday and extended their
winning streak to 10.
	   The 10-game streak tied the club record set in 1968, when the
team was known as the Taiyo Whales.
	   The Tigers suffered their seventh straight defeat.
	   Rose, formerly with the California Angels, singled home runs in
the first and third innings, hit a two-run single in the sixth and
singled home another run in the three-run ninth.
	   The Baystars are 5 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who blanked the Yomiuri Giants 2-0 at Nagoya Dome.
	   The Dragons' Takeshi Yamasaki drove in the first run with a
sacrifice fly in the first inning and singled home the second run
in the fifth.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, Atsunori Inaba singled home one run
and pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii drove in another with an infield hit as
the Yakult Swallows edged the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 2-1.
	   The Swallows' Ishii pitched a five-hitter with 15 strikeouts for
his eighth victory against four defeats.
	   In the Pacific League, the front-running Nippon Ham Fighters
scored the winning run on Seibu Lions shortstop Kazuo Matsui's
error following a two-run double by Atsushi Kataoka in the eighth
and beat the second-place Lions 5-4 at Seibu Dome.
	   Kataoka also hit a two-run home run, his 13th homer of the
season, in the first inning.
	   The victory widened the Fighters' lead over the Lions to nine
games.
	   At Osaka Dome, Tuffy Rhodes hit a three-run home run in the
four-run fifth inning as the Kintetsu Buffaloes blanked the Fukuoka
Daiei Hawks 11-0 and moved into third place. The Hawks fell to
fourth.
	   Rhodes, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has 13 homers.
	   At Kobe, Julio Franco smashed a two-run home run in the first
inning and Kazuya Fukuura doubled home another run in the fourth as
the Chiba Lotte Marines edged the Orix BlueWave 3-2.
	   Brian Warren, formerly with the Texas Rangers, held the BlueWave
to one hit and no runs in the last inning for his first save.
	   Franco, formerly with the Milwaukee Brewers, has 15 homers.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In some of the most intense fighting
in months, Serb forces backed by tanks advanced Sunday against
ethnic Albanian rebels, who offered strong resistance to government
efforts to clear key roads in rebellious Kosovo province.
	   Both sides admitted suffering casualties in the fighting, which
has been raging since Friday night along at least three fronts.
	   Nervous Serb police turned back reporters who tried to reach the
scene of the fighting. Some of the policemen acknowledged that the
Kosovo Liberation Army was putting up a strong fight.
	   Reporters could hear explosions and the rattle of automatic
gunfire reverberating through the hills west of this provincial
capital. Smoke could be seen rising from red-roofed villages.
	   The offensive -- the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April -- appeared aimed at clearing KLA fighters
from three strategic highways: one westward from Pristina to Pecs,
another south to the town of Prizren and a third along the Albanian
border in western Kosovo.
	   If successful, the operation would split the estimated one-third
of the province under rebel control and block routes to their
sanctuaries in neighboring Albanian from which the insurgents
smuggle weapons.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said police drove KLA
fighters from the villages of Banja and Zociste, site of a Serbian
Orthodox monastery which the guerrilla had controlled since early
this month.
	   The Serbian Media Center said two policemen have been killed and
another two were wounded in fighting south of Pristina toward
Prizren. Serb sources claimed 11 Albanians died in fighting south
of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government forces in
western Kosovo.
	   In its account, the Kosovo Information Center, run by
independence-seeking Albanians, reported ``at least'' 10 Serb
policemen have died in the fighting. The Albanians put KLA losses
at one dead and one wounded.
	   The Albanian center also said eight Albanian civilians have been
killed and about 40 wounded in two days of fighting across the
province, where Albanians form 90 percent of the population.
	   On the road between Pristina and Pecs, 75 kilometers (45 miles)
to the west, police cleared some of the barricades rebels had
erected weeks ago. But fighting continued along the road Sunday,
and the Serbian center conceded that ``armed Albanians are giving
strong resistance.''
	   Success by government troops could open way for talks on the
province's future between moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The KLA has refused to acknowledge Rugova's leadership because
he opposes violence. U.S. and European mediation has focused on
bringing the two sides to the table.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo called on the United
States, NATO and other foreign governments to halt the fighting,
warning it could increase ``the danger of total and bloody war'' in
Kosovo.
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' Rugova's party said.
	   Rugova also backs full independence for the Kosovo - which the
international community rules out - but the West is promoting him
as the chief Kosovo Albanian representative because he opposes
violence.
	   However, his renunciation of violence has alienated him from
many Kosovo Albanians. Shabana Shala, a former Rugova aide who had
defected to the KLA, said in an interview published Sunday in
Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore that ``Rugova...has lost
validity because he was not capable to fulfill promises and
people's will.''
	   Milosevic has offered to restore autonomy, which he abolished in
1989, but opposes independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia,
which in turn is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Foreign powers fear the fighting will spread to other countries
with large Albanian communities. On Sunday, state television in
neighboring Macedonia said a ``large group'' _ presumably Albanians
_ tried to cross illegally into the country from Albania.
	   The report gave no further details except to say three people
were arrested.

Washington Gov. Locke urges investment in his state

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Washington Gov. Gary Locke urged Taiwanese
business people Sunday to invest in his state, saying investment
risks in Asia have increased because of the regional financial
turmoil.
	   ``Our state offers stability,'' Locke, the United States' first
Chinese-American governor, told a news conference.
	   ``Investment there will be more secure than some places in Asia,
where the fluctuations of currencies could make investments
risky,'' he added.
	   Locke arrived earlier Sunday at the head of a 50-member trade
delegation for a four-day visit. Because of his Chinese ancestry,
his visit has received wide interest in the news media.
	   But Locke said he didn't come to Taiwan to promote himself,
adding that there were many Taiwanese-Americans who have made great
accomplishments in Washington state, including several business
leaders traveling with him.
	   Locke said he will meet with government officials to discuss
their efforts to fight the smuggling of Chinese apples into Taiwan
_ apples that are mislabeled as being from Washington.
	   He said the smuggling has damaged the image of Washington
apples, which he called ``the Mercedes in apples.''
	   Taiwan imported 130,000 tons of apples last year, of which
110,000 tons came from the United States.
	   Locke will also meet with President Lee Teng-hui and other
officials before he returns home Thursday.
	   The centerpieces of his visit will be two seminars to attract
investment, one in Taipei and the other in the southern port city
of Kaohsiung.

Assad in Egypt to discuss Middle East peace prospects

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad held talks
Sunday with Egypt's president on the troubled Middle East peace
process.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met Assad at the Alexandria
airport, and the two went together to the Ras el-Tin Palace for
their meeting.
	   The two leaders talked briefly with reporters after meeting but
gave few details of their discussions, which Mubarak described as a
regular session on developing issues.
	   Asked if the United States had not effectively withdrawn from
the Middle East peace process, Mubarak said that Washington ``is
the basis of the process'' and is still insisting on pushing for
Mideast peace.
	   The Egyptian leader, who in May joined with France in proposing
a new international conference on the Middle East, said that any
European role in the region would be supplementary to the U.S.
effort.
	   Assad, asked if he had any objection to the Egyptian-French idea
for a peace conference, said only ``it is being discussed.''
	   Assad left to return to Syria after the four-hour meeting.
	   Mubarak and Assad held private talks before being joined by
aides, including Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam and Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria. Also attending the sessions
were Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury, Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa and the defense minister, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
	   Among topics that the two leaders had been expected to discuss
were the continued deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian talks and a new
complication in Israel's possible withdrawal from Syria's Golan
Heights caused by a recent vote in Israel's Parliament.
	   Syria expressed anger after the Parliament on July 22 gave
preliminary approval to a bill requiring that a referendum be held
in Israel on any decision to withdraw from the heights.
	   Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
War. Syria insists the land must be returned as a condition for
peace, but Israel argues it cannot pull out entirely for security
reasons.
	   Negotiations between the two countries last we held in February
1996 and have not resumed since Israelis later that year elected
hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister.
	   Last week, Palestinians and Israelis held their first high-level
face-to-face meetings in months, but there was no breakthrough.

Shell companies to pump dlrs 3 billion into Malaysia over five
</HEADLINE>
years &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two companies of the Shell oil
conglomerate will pump dlrs 3 billion in capital investment and
operating expenditure into Malaysia over the next five years, a
news report said Sunday.
	   The proposed investments demonstrate Shell's confidence in
Malaysia and its commitment to develop oil and gas reserves for
growth and long-term profitability, the managing director of the
two companies, Lim Haw Kuang, said Saturday night in Kuching,
capital of Sarawak state.
	   Sarawak Shell Bhd and Sarawak Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. will put
in dlrs 1.8 billion in capital investment and dlrs 1.2 billion in
operating expenditure, the report said.
	   The money for exploration will be spent in Sarawak and Sabah,
both states on Borneo island, the Sunday Star reported.
	   Lim said six exploration wells were being drilled in Sarawak and
four in Sabah.
	   ``Development plans are also being vigorously pursued for the
fields which have been discovered but are not yet developed,'' he
said.
	   Lim also announced that Shell had acquired the interests of
American-based oil company Occidental following a complex
international assets swap recently.
	   He said this deal could lead to a further investment of up to
dlrs 250 million by Shell.
	   Production by both companies this year will generate some
707,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Sabah and Sarawak
waters, the paper said.
	   ``This means generating dlrs 3.6 billion of revenue at the oil
price of dlrs 14 per barrel,'' said Lim.

Thailand urges Japan to reform financial system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Thailand made an impassioned plea to
Japan Sunday to clean up its financial system and stimulate
domestic demand to help revive the region's floundering economies.
	   Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul, attending the
annual foreign ministers' meeting of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, said Japan could help the region's ailing economies
recover by getting its ``own financial house in order.''
	   ``The financial disease started in Japan in 1991-92, and they
never cured it. So it cropped up somewhere else, like malaria. We
were the manifestation of that disease.''
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, who is set to become the
next prime minister, said Sunday he would reassure his counterparts
in neighboring countries, as well as the United States and Russia,
of his commitment to revitalize Japan's economy.
	   Obuchi was making a 12-hour visit to the ASEAN meeting Sunday to
hold brief talks with his counterparts from the United States,
Russia, South Korea and the Philippines.
	   He wasn't scheduled to hold direct talks with the Thai foreign
minister, but was to attend a dinner with all the ASEAN ministers
later Sunday.
	   Kobsak called on Japan to stimulate domestic demand so it can
import more from Southeast Asia. Japan is the region's biggest
trading partner and main investor.
	   Stability in the Japanese yen, he said, is also vital.
	   ``If the yen fluctuates ... it will make our recovery very
hard,'' he said.
	   Thailand's economy has been among the region's hardest hit in
the year-old financial crisis, with the Thai baht falling some 40
percent against the U.S. dollar in the period.
	   The investment community is looking to Obuchi to speedily
implement measures to revive Japan's floundering economy, such as
cutting taxes and sorting out a debt-ridden banking sector.
	   Obuchi's whistlestop visit came a day after ASEAN foreign
ministers issued a joint communique that urged action on the part
of Tokyo. Japan must ``expedite the implementation of its economic
measures in support of the economic recovery of ASEAN countries,''
it said.
	   Elected president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
last week, Obuchi is almost certain to be selected the country's
next prime minister when parliament convenes to choose Ryutaro
Hashimoto's successor July 30.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Turkey split over amnesty for prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey appeared divided Sunday over a
proposed amnesty for prisoners which would empty out the country's
overcrowded prisons of all inmates except those convicted of
terrorism.
	   Leaders of the three parties in the coalition government on
Saturday agreed to work toward the general pardon, which would free
an estimated 50,000 prisoners if parliament approves it.
	   Among those to benefit would be hundreds of people locked up
under Turkey's much criticized laws curbing freedom of expression
would benefit. But also getting out to the dismay of some would be
convicted murderers, rapists and thieves.
	   Oktay Eksi, columnist for the newspaper Hurriyet, advocated
changing the laws, not issuing a pardon.
	   Changing the laws ``wouldn't be a temporary arrangement like an
amnesty is -- tomorrow another person could go to prison for his
opinions,'' Eksi said.
	   One opposition party, pro-Islamic Virtue, favors the amnesty and
hopes the spirit of it would extend to those not imprisoned but
punished otherwise, namely the Islamic movement's former leader
Necmettin Erbakan, who has been banned from holding political
office for five years because of anti-secular activities.
	   Other opposition parties have criticized the proposal as an
attempt by the governing parties, with an eye to elections in
April, to win votes from prisoners' families.
	   The independent human rights association is among the backers of
the amnesty.
	   The most outspoken opponent of amnesty for criminals is top
industrialist Sakip Sabanci, whose brother was assassinated two
years ago by leftist gunmen.
	   Newspapers pointed out that also standing to benefit were a
number of criticized well-off personalities who have left the
country to avoid prison for fraud, tax-evasion and smuggling.
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit has been pushing for the amnesty
after his wife was reportedly touched by the story of a child
growing up in prison because her mother had murdered a man who
raped her while she was pregnant.

Marxism meets carpet-baggers in former Khmer Rouge stronghold

<TEXT>
	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ New and old Cambodia were represented at
polling stations Sunday in Pailin as former communist guerrillas
queued up alongside fortune seekers to vote in this former Khmer
Rouge stronghold.
	   Lines of people anxious to cast ballots _ many for the first
time _ formed just after sunrise in this trading town near the Thai
border, which used to serve as the commercial center for the Khmer
Rouge revolutionary group.
	   The same riches that attracted the Khmer Rouge _ timber and gems
_ have brought settlers from all over Cambodia keen to make their
fortune. There are 15,752 registered voters.
	   ``It is the first time I vote,'' said Suthep, 43, a former
guerrilla. ``For me, I changed myself to an ordinary person instead
of a communist. I don't really understand democracy. I vote for
those who I think are capable of protecting the country. I want
peace.''
	   But while polls here went smoothly, and were even praised by
some observers as ``model elections,'' the guerrillas' former
allies launched a murderous attack 300 kilometers (200 miles) away
in Anlong Veng, leaving 10 people dead.
	   Pailin was the first major Khmer Rouge settlement to make peace
and switch sides to the government two years ago. Anlong Veng was
the last. The army took control in April after most of the
war-weary rebels made peace.
	   But die-hards led by the one-legged general Ta Mok are still
holding out in the northern jungles and claim disgruntled defectors
may soon join them.
	   When the Khmer Rouge ruled between 1975 and 1979, as many as 2
million Cambodians died through overwork, illness, starvation and
systematic execution. The group continued to wage low-intensity
warfare against successive governments after Vietnam toppled it in
1979.
	   Pailin today is governed by basically the same people who held
sway when it was the center of anti-government activity.
	   But the senior Khmer Rouge figure who took the area and its
people over to the government, one-time foreign minister Ieng Sary,
now espouses capitalism and democracy.
	   In fact, Pailin is run somewhat like a fiefdom by its governor,
former guerrilla commander Y Chhien, Ieng Sary's right-hand man.
	   While allowing capitalism to flourish relatively unrestrained,
he still maintains the kind of guerrilla discipline that
discourages crime. His control also allows the province to have
what was probably one of the country's fairest and least violent
election campaigns, election observers said.
	   Y Chhien himself announced he would not vote and did not endorse
any party, though Ieng Sary threw his support behind strongman Hun
Sen.
	   Even those who had voted before _ people who have come to seek
their fortune in the past two years _ described this as a model
election.
	   ``Everybody is talking about it and is real excited to vote,''
said Sam Sophea, 25, who had a job as a temporary election worker.
He said he voted in the 1993 U.N.-supervised election and ``that
was worse than this one, because last time a lot of people died.''
	   The most prominent voter in Pailin Sunday was Ieng Sary.
	   ``This is the first time in my life that I participated in
voting,'' he told reporters after casting his ballot at a Buddhist
pagoda. ``My feeling is that now that Cambodian people are starting
the democratic process. There is still a long way to go.''
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, he regretted that the
Khmer Rouge _ which went by the name Democratic Kampuchea _ did not
participate in the 1993 election, as it had agreed to do under the
country's 1991 peace agreement.
	   ``If at that time Democratic Kampuchea took the opportunity to
follow through, then we might have resolved the Cambodian problem
to a better extent,'' Ieng Sary said. ``But because Democratic
Kampuchea did not have the right position, the war was prolonged
for some more years.''
	   Ieng Sary's political group, the Democratic National Unity
Movement, last week endorsed Hun Sen's party. He said that Hun
Sen's strong point is that he is decisive, while a fault might be
that ``he becomes very angry a bit quickly.''
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun Sen's chief rival, has
difficulties in keeping his FUNCINPEC party united, Ieng Sary said.
	   ``In my view, His Excellency Hun Sen is better qualified,'' Ieng
Sary said. ``But I'm not saying that Prince Ranariddh is not
qualified.''

At least 20 dead in first massacres during U.N. mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UN mission meetings with opposition, military
chief
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed groups killed at least 20 people
overnight in western Algeria, officials said Sunday, in the first
massacres since a U.N. fact-finding mission arrived to investigate
a Muslim insurgency.
	   Security forces said 12 people were killed in the village of
Khelil, near the town of Tlemcen on the Moroccan border. Hospital
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 15 were slashed
to death and two wounded by gunfire.
	   Interior Minister Mustapha Benmansour visited the site, and
security forces were mobilized early Sunday to search for the
attackers, officials said.
	   Another armed group killed eight people overnight in Sidi
Athmane near Saida, 420 kms (250 miles) southwest of Algiers,
authorities and hospital officials said.
	   There was no claim of responsibility, but suspicion fell on
Muslim militants waging a 6 1/2-year-old struggle to topple the
military-backed government that canceled January 1992 elections the
Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in the insurgency. While the
Salvation Front has condemned massacres, the Armed Islamic Group
has been linked to the slaughter of hundreds of villagers in recent
months.
	   The wave of killings prompted the visit by a six-member U.N.
panel, led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares. The mission
arrived Wednesday for what was expected to be a two-week visit.
	   The panel issued no comment about the latest killings and
maintained a low profile Sunday, holding meetings with Ahmed
Djeddai, national secretary of the Front for Socialist Forces and
other opposition leaders.
	   The government was not expected to allow the group to meet with
the Salvation Front, banned in 1992.
	   But the mission on Sunday also grilled the armed forces chief of
staff, Mohamed Lamari, asking him about how the army was fighting
the insurgency, said an informed source speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The independent newspaper Le Matin reported the delegation
sought to meet with families of people missing in the insurgency
and that they would visit massacre sites identified by the
government.
	   On Friday, an Algerian human rights leader told the mission that
security forces could be responsible for the disappearances of as
many as 18,000 people since 1994.
	   The mission, which is to report back to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, is looking into allegations the government of the
petroleum-rich North African nation had at least a passive role in
the massacres.

Violence unabating, Serbian police advance against Kosovo rebels

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In some of the most intense fighting
in months, Serb forces backed by tanks advanced Sunday against
ethnic Albanian rebels, who offered strong resistance to government
efforts to clear key roads in rebellious Kosovo province.
	   Both sides said they suffered casualties in the fighting, which
has been raging since Friday night along at least three fronts.
	   Nervous Serb police turned back reporters who tried to reach the
scene of the fighting. Some police officers acknowledged that the
Kosovo Liberation Army was putting up a strong fight.
	   Reporters could hear explosions and the rattle of automatic
gunfire reverberating through the hills west of the provincial
capital of Pristina. Smoke could be seen rising from red-roofed
villages.
	   The offensive -- the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April -- appeared aimed at clearing KLA fighters
from three strategic highways: one westward from Pristina to
Kosovo's second-largest city, Pec, another south to the town of
Prizren and a third along the Albanian border in western Kosovo.
	   If successful, the operation would split the estimated one-third
of the province under rebel control and block routes to their
sanctuaries in neighboring Albania from which the insurgents
smuggle weapons.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said police drove KLA
fighters from the villages of Banja and Zociste, site of a Serbian
Orthodox monastery that the guerrillas had controlled since early
this month.
	   The Serbian Media Center said two policemen have been killed and
another two were wounded in fighting south of Pristina toward
Prizren. Serb sources claimed 11 Albanians died in fighting south
of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government forces in
western Kosovo.
	   In its account, the Kosovo Information Center, run by separatist
ethnic Albanians, reported at least 10 Serb policemen have died in
the fighting. The Albanians put KLA losses at one dead and one
wounded.
	   The Albanian center also said eight Albanian civilians have been
killed and about 40 wounded in two days of fighting across the
province.
	   On the road between Pristina and Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles)
to the west, police cleared some of the barricades rebels had
erected weeks ago. Fighting continued along the road Sunday.

87th annual Wagner festival opens in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAYREUTH, Germany (AP) _ The 87th annual Wagner opera festival
opened Saturday in Bayreuth with a repeat production of ``The
Flying Dutchman'' under the direction of Dieter Dorn.
	   President Roman Herzog was among the government officials and
other prominent guests at the opening night of the festival, which
runs through Aug. 28.
	   Some have complained about the lack of premieres at this year's
festival. Dorn's fairy-tale staging of ``The Flying Dutchman'' was
first shown here in 1990.
	   ``The staging is perhaps not so much exposed to an aging process
because it's not overemphasized,'' Dorn said in defending the
repeat.
	   Also to be shown for the last time is Alfred Kirchner's
interpretation of the ``Ring des Nibelungen,'' Richard Wagner's
most complex work. Juergen Flimm, director of the Thalia theater in
Hamburg, is to premiere his new staging of the Ring cycle at
Bayreuth in 2000.

Assad in Egypt to discuss Middle East peace prospects

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) _ The presidents of Syria and Egypt met
Sunday to discuss the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met Syrian President Hafez
Assad talked briefly with reporters after the meeting at the Ras
el-Tin Palace, but gave few details of their discussions, which
Mubarak described as a regular session on developing issues.
	   Assad left to return to Syria after the four-hour meeting.
	   The Egyptian leader, who in May joined with France in proposing
a new international conference on the Middle East, said that any
European role in the region would be supplementary to the U.S.
effort.
	   Mubarak and Assad talked privately before being joined by aides,
including Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria and Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzoury, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and the defense minister,
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
	   Among the topics the two leaders had been expected to discuss,
were the continued deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and
a new complication in Israel's possible withdrawal from Syria's
Golan Heights.
	   Syria expressed anger after Israel's parliament gave preliminary
approval July 22 to a bill requiring a referendum be held on any
decision to withdraw from the area.
	   Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
War. Syria insists the land must be returned as a condition for
peace, but Israel argues it cannot pull out entirely for security
reasons.
	   There have been no negotiations between the two countries since
February 1996.

Report: Israeli award to insurance firm sued over Holocaust claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to give
an award to an Italian insurance giant accused of failing to pay
out policies of Holocaust victims, Israel Radio said Sunday.
	   The award is being given to Assicurazioni Generali, based in
Trieste, Italy, for contributing to the Israeli economy through its
purchase of the Israeli insurance company Migdal, the radio report
said.
	   Michael Kleiner, a legislator in Netanyahu's Likud Party, said
the award should not go to a company that has refused to pay
policies of Jews who perished at the hands of the Nazis during
World War II.
	   ``It completely lacks sensitivity to give a prize to to the
president of a company which is sitting on the money of Jews who
were killed in the Holocaust,'' Kleiner said.
	   Netanyahu's office did not respond to requests from The
Associated Press for comment.
	   Generali has said it is not liable for the unpaid policies
because many of its east European offices and assets were taken
over by communist governments after World War II.
	   The Italian company is one of 16 European insurance companies
named in a federal class-action suit filed last year in New York.
Another suit was filed in February in a Los Angeles Superior Court
by family members of five Holocaust victims.
	   Some Jewish leaders, however, have praised Generali for actions
such as assisting Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial,
in gathering lists of Holocaust victims.
	   Last year, Generali established a dlrs 12 million fund for
Holocaust survivors. And the company has expressed support for an
international commission to investigate claims by victims and their
families.

Leaney Dutch Open champion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HILVERSUM, Netherlands (AP) _ Australian Steven Leaney held off
a late challenge from Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke to win the
Dutch Open golf by a single stroke Sunday.
	   Leaney survived a bogey on the 11th to go round in 67 and finish
at 18 under par. It was his second European PGA title of the year,
following the Moroccan Open.
	   ``I don't words can tell the whole story,'' he said after
picking up a first-prize cheque for 133,333 pounds (dlrs 220,000).
``It's great to win against guys like Darren Clarke, Nick Price and
Lee Westwood.''
	   Low scores were helped by almost perfect conditions with the
greens in best-ever state, and Clarke's 8-under-par 63 equalled the
Hilversumsche course record for the third time this week.
	   Leaney and Westwood shot the other two 63s in earlier rounds.
	   Clarke went out with four birdies and an eagle three on the
fourth for a front nine of 30. He bogeyed the 10th but came back
with at birdies 13 and 14.
	   England's Lee Westwood, who led the tourney for the first two
rounds, missed an eagle put at the par-5 18th for a share of second
place with Clarke.
	   Westwood's 1-over-par 72 put him tied for fourth on 16 under
with Zimbabwean Nick Price, who went round today in 69.

Tour de France looking to Alps with O'Grady taking stage

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) - Stuart O'Grady of Australia, who had the
overall lead for three days earlier in the race, used his sprinting
ability to capture the 15th stage of the Tour de France.
	   Defending champion Jan Ullrich still held the overall lead in
the race, 71 seconds ahead of American Bobby Julich.
	   O'Grady was part of a six-man breakaway that left the pack early
in the day. He just edged Itaian Giuseppe Calcaterra at the line
for the victory.
	   With a world title in team sprinting and Olympic medals on the
track, O'Grady knew he was expected be strong in the final stretch.
	   ``I knew if it came down to a sprint, they would be watching for
me,'' O'Grady said. ``But I didn't want to have done all that work
in the break and have the win go to someone else.''
	   O'Grady and the five others kept building their lead over the
last 120 kilometers (75 miles) ending up with 10 minutes over the
pack. Sunday's stage was from Valreas to Grenoble, 187 kilometers
(116 miles), the last day before the Alps.
	   With temperatures above 30 C (86 F) and no threats in the group
ahead, the major favorites conserved their strength with the Alps
coming up over the next three days.
	   Of the top six in the stage, Peter Meinert-Nielsen of Denmark
was the closest to Ullrich in the overall standings entering the
day at more than 38 minutes behind. The rest were nearly an hour or
more. So, even with the margin up to 11 minutes at one point, there
was no need for the pack to panic.
	   Meinert-Nielsen came in fifth, the second straight fifth-place
finish for a member of the U.S. Postal team.
	   Orlando Rodrigues of Portugal was third with Leon Van Bon of the
Netherlands.
	   Laurent Desbiens, another former yellow jersey holder earlier in
the Tour, was sixth.
	   Monday's 15th stage from Grenoble to Les Deux Alpes, 189
kilometers (117.5 miles) with four major climbs including two rated
``out of category'' on a scale of steepness, height and length.
	   While the Tour appeared almost racing under normal activity, the
next step of the drug scandal will unfold Monday.
	   The TVM team's director and doctor were ordered jailed over the
weekend. They were expected to be brought to Reims for more
investigation concerning a drug seizure in the car of one of its
officials in March.
	   Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc has said that he will throw the
TVM team out of the Tour, as he did with the Festina team, if there
is any evidance or statements concerning use of prohibited drugs by
the team.
	   Three officials of the Festina team, including the dirctor and
the team doctor, had drug charges against them and were jailed.

Violence unabating, Serbian police advance against Kosovo rebels

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In some of the most intense fighting
in months, Serb forces backed by tanks advanced Sunday against
ethnic Albanian rebels, who offered strong resistance to government
efforts to clear key roads in rebellious Kosovo province.
	   Both sides admitted suffering casualties in the fighting, which
has been raging since Friday night along at least three fronts. No
reliable, independent casualty figures were available.
	   Nervous Serb police turned back reporters who tried to reach the
scene of the fighting. Some of the policemen acknowledged that the
Kosovo Liberation Army was putting up a strong fight.
	   Reporters could hear explosions and the rattle of automatic
gunfire reverberating through the hills west of this provincial
capital. Smoke could be seen rising from red-roofed villages.
	   The offensive -- the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April -- appeared aimed at clearing KLA fighters
from three strategic highways: one westward from Pristina to Pec,
another south to the town of Prizren and a third along the Albanian
border in western Kosovo.
	   If successful, the operation would split the estimated one-third
of the province under rebel control and block routes to their
sanctuaries in neighboring Albanian from which the insurgents
smuggle weapons.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said police drove KLA
fighters from the villages of Banja and Zociste, site of a Serbian
Orthodox monastery which the guerrilla had controlled since early
this month.
	   The Serbian Media Center said two policemen have been killed and
another two were wounded in fighting south of Pristina toward
Prizren. Serb sources claimed 11 Albanians died in fighting south
of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government forces in
western Kosovo.
	   In its account, the Kosovo Information Center, run by
independence-seeking Albanians, reported ``at least'' 10 Serb
policemen have died in the fighting. The Albanians put KLA losses
at one dead and one wounded.
	   The Albanian center also said eight Albanian civilians have been
killed and about 40 wounded in two days of fighting across the
province, where Albanians form 90 percent of the population.
	   On the road between Pristina and Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles)
to the west, police used bulldozers to clear KLA barricades which
had blocked the road for several weeks. The bulldozers pushed aside
mounds of dirt, rocks, burned out cars and trucks which formed the
barricades.
	   Police said the road was still unsafe because it had been mined
with makeshift booby traps. Fighting continued along the road
Sunday, and the Serbian center conceded that ``armed Albanians are
giving strong resistance.''
	   Success by government troops could open way for talks on the
province's future between moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The KLA has refused to acknowledge Rugova's leadership because
he opposes violence. U.S. and European mediation has focused on
bringing the two sides to the table.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo called on the United
States, NATO and other foreign governments to halt the fighting,
warning it could increase ``the danger of total and bloody war'' in
Kosovo.
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' Rugova's party said.
	   Rugova also backs full independence for the Kosovo - which the
international community rules out - but the West is promoting him
as the chief Kosovo Albanian representative because he opposes
violence.
	   However, his renunciation of violence has alienated him from
many Kosovo Albanians. Shabana Shala, a former Rugova aide who had
defected to the KLA, said in an interview published Sunday in
Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore that ``Rugova...has lost
validity because he was not capable to fulfill promises and
people's will.''
	   Milosevic has offered to restore autonomy, which he abolished in
1989, but opposes independence. Kosovo is a province of Serbia,
which in turn is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Foreign powers fear the fighting will spread to other countries
with large Albanian communities. On Sunday, state television in
neighboring Macedonia said a ``large group'' _ presumably Albanians
_ tried to cross illegally into the country from Albania.
	   The report gave no further details except to say three people
were arrested.

England set eyes on a fourth test victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES tea score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Andrew Fraser's 10-wicket match haul
breathed new life into the test cricket series between England and
South Africa on Sunday.
	   The English medium-pace bowler took 5-62 in South Africa's
second innings 208, giving England a target of 245 to win the
fourth test at Trent Bridge and level the series at 1-1 with one
match to play.
	   Fraser, selected ahead of left arm fast bowler Allan Mullally
after a toss of a coin, claimed 5-60 in South Africa's first
innings _ it is only the second time in his 42-test career has
taken a 10-wicket haul.
	   The England openers _ Mark Butcher and Mike Atherton _ who put
on 145 in the first innings, took the home side to 26 without loss
at tea on the penultimate day.
	   South Africa secured a 38-run first innings lead but collapsed
in its second innings to give England it's only real chance of
victory this series since the first test at Edgbaston.
	   Hansie Cronje, who inspired South Africa with a fine 126 in the
first innings, held the second innings together after the visitors
were initially reduced to 21 for three.
	   Cronje, 67, shared a 98-run partnership with Daryll Cullinan
(56) and then combined with Mark Boucher (35) to prop the second
innings.
	   Dominic Cork, facing the selectors' axe after series of poor
bowling, took 4-60 and triggered the South African second innings
slump.
	   South Africa, resuming the day on 92 for three, progressed to
119 before Fraser removed Cullinan.
	   Cork had Jonty Rhodes adjudged caught behind and then forced
Shaun Pollock to chase a wide delivery and edge a catch to
wicketkeeper Alec Stewart.
	   Fraser mopped up the South African tail _ Boucher, Steve
Elworthy and Paul Adams _ to leave his batsmen a minimum of 135
overs to force a win.
	   But history suggests the task will be harder for England than it
seems.
	   England has only successfully chased anything over 240 to win a
test in the fourth innings on six occasions _ the last time was
against New Zealand in Christchurch in 1996-97 when England scored
307 for six chasing at target of 304.
	   The last time England won a test at home by scoring more than
240 in the fourth innings was in 1902 against Australia.
	   South Africa has lead the series 1-0 since its 10-wicket victory
at Lord's in the second test.

Kohl views reworked design for Holocaust Memorial; debate
</HEADLINE>
continues &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Berlin mayor also viewing model; spox refusing to
comment on Kohl's reaction. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has promised to decide
on a design for Germany's national Holocaust Memorial before the
fall election, went to see a reworked model by his favored artist,
a government spokesman said Sunday.
	   But whether it will actually be built in Berlin next year as
planned may depend on the outcome of the Sept. 27 election.
	   The designated cultural affairs minister for the opposition
Social Democrats, Michael Naumann, told German television his party
might not abide by Kohl's decision if it succeeds in unseating him.
	   The project has been surrounded in controversy since it was
first conceived more than 10 years ago, with Germans arguing over
its design, location and purpose.
	   Kohl rejected the original design in 1995 as too bombastic,
forcing a new competition. A winner was to be announced this spring
but has been repeatedly delayed, apparently by complaints about the
four finalists.
	   Last week Kohl, who remains committed to the project, promised
an announcement before the elections.
	   On Saturday, he stopped at the German Historical Museum in
Berlin for 30 minutes to see New York-based architect Peter
Eisenmann's revised model. Kohl's spokesman would not say what the
chancellor thought of it.
	   The original design by Eisenmann and American sculptor Richard
Serra _ known to be Kohl's favorite _ had envisioned a labyrinthian
field of 4,000 concrete pillars resembling a cemetery.
	   Serra withdrew from the project in June, citing personal and
professional reasons. Eisenmann's scaled-down design, which has yet
to be publicly shown, reportedly is sunken so that visitors on the
edges can get an overview of the entire memorial, and adds a border
of trees.
	   Naumann, who has criticized building any central memorial as too
cold and ``monumental,'' accused Kohl of acting like ``a baroque
prince'' in taking the decision upon himself.
	   Naumann told ZDF television he would like to see a national
documentation center about Nazi genocide instead of a memorial. He
added that the Social Democrats had not decided whether they would
stick with Kohl's decision about the memorial if they win the
election.
	   Michel Friedman, a board member of the Central Council of Jews
in Germany, told ZDF that Germany could use both a memorial and
documentation center.
	   Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, who has also spoken out against
the memorial, went with Kohl to see Eisenmann's revised model. A
party colleague said Sunday that Diepgen remained skeptical and
warned against rushing the decision.

3-0 shutout over China in nine innings.
	   China placed third at 5-2, followed by the Netherlands Antilles,

Israel may give award to insurance firm sued over Holocaust claims

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's economic
staff has recommended giving an award to an Italian insurance giant
accused of failing to pay out policies of Holocaust victims, his
office confirmed Sunday.
	   The award is being given to Assicurazioni Generali, based in
Trieste, Italy, along with a number of other companies that made
major investments in Israel, Netanyahu's adviser Bobby Brown said.
Generali purchased control of the Israeli insurance company Migdal
for more than dlrs 200 million.
	   Brown said the list of recommendations, which Netanyahu has not
yet acted on, includes all companies that invested more than dlrs
50 million in Israel.
	   Michael Kleiner, a legislator in Netanyahu's Likud Party, said
the award should not go to a company that has refused to pay
policies of Jews who perished at the hands of the Nazis during
World War II.
	   ``It completely lacks sensitivity to give a prize to to the
president of a company which is sitting on the money of Jews who
were killed in the Holocaust,'' Kleiner said.
	   Generali has said it is not liable for the unpaid policies
because many of its east European offices and assets were taken
over by communist governments after World War II.
	   The Italian company is one of 16 European insurance companies
named in a federal class-action suit filed last year in New York.
Another suit was filed in February in a Los Angeles Superior Court
by family members of five Holocaust victims.
	   Some Jewish leaders, however, have praised Generali for actions
such as assisting Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial,
in gathering lists of Holocaust victims.
	   Last year, Generali established a dlrs 12 million fund for
Holocaust survivors. And the company has expressed support for an
international commission to investigate claims by victims and their
families.
	   Brown said he would meet in New York later this week with
representatives of Generali and four other insurance companies to
discuss how to handle Holocaust claims. The discussions have no
connection to the economic award, he said.

More family time was key factor in McCurrey resignation from White
</HEADLINE>
House &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said Sunday
he has no doubt that a prime reason behind White House Press
Secretary Mike McCurry's decision to step down in the fall is to
spend more time with his young family.
	   ``It is difficult if you've got young children. He's got young
children. I've got young children and ... the phone never stops,''
Alastair Campbell said in a rare interview on BBC Radio 4. ``You
get that intrusion and pressure on family life, and it can be very
difficult.''
	   Campbell said he had ``no doubt at all that is one of the prime
reasons behind his decision.''
	   President Clinton announced Thursday that McCurry, who has been
at the White House since 1995, was resigning. McCurry did not
reveal his future plans, saying he would like to teach and explore
options that don't involve being a spokesman _ a duty he has
performed in Washington for 22 years.
	   Campbell described how McCurry broke White House protocol at a
banquet for Blair earlier this year by insisting that he and his
wife sit at the same table _ rather than at separate tables _ so
they could spend a few hours together. Campbell and his partner,
Fiona Millar, joined them.
	   The British and American spokesmen telephone each other
regularly.
	   Campbell said they spoke at least once a day during the Iraqi
crisis earlier this year and frequently during the negotiations on
a Northern Ireland peace agreement. Last week, he called McCurry
when a British newspaper reported that Britain and the United
States were set to approve a trial in The Netherlands for the two
Libyans accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland in 1988.
	   ``I didn't want to say anything that would in any sense make
things difficult for the United States on that, and the only way to
deal with that I'm afraid was to get Mike out of bed at 5 a.m.,''
Campbell said.
	   ``Mike doesn't object to that. He knows I wouldn't do it unless
it was important. And likewise there are times when he's got me out
of bed in the middle of the night to discuss things that he wants
to talk about,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) _ Miguel Cabrera was waiting in a long line
at a dingy market for the only things for sale: potatoes and
plantains.
	   He had waited for two hours, but it was lunchtime and the store
was closing. Cabrera walked away with an empty shopping bag,
wondering what his family of five would eat Saturday.
	   ``Forget it,'' he said. ``I'll try again in the afternoon.''
	   Cabrera wasn't planning to attend Fidel Castro's speech Sunday
night commemorating the anniversary of the battle that began the
Cuban Revolution.
	   ``I don't have time for that. I have things to do at home,'' he
said.
	   Forty-five years after the fight for the Moncada barracks _
Castro's rebels were repulsed, but consider it the beginning of
their 5 1/2-year uprising _ daily life tests many Cubans'
revolutionary spirit.
	   The gap between rich and poor has grown. While most people
praise government health care and education, they also complain
that their government salaries aren't enough to live on.
	   Most blame the three-decade U.S. embargo on their communist
nation, but some are coming to blame the government as well.
	   ``Some people still have hope for the revolution,'' Cabrera
said. Asked about those who don't, he looked away.
	   Still, there are those who support Castro with heartfelt
conviction.
	   ``I love Fidel,'' said Luis Hidalgo Castillo, 52, a toothless
retired construction worker drinking beer outside the Abel Santa
Maria apartment block. ``I adore my revolution. I adore my
government.''
	   Cabrera, an industrial mechanic in Santiago, his wife and his
mother-in-law earn a total of 423 pesos a month (dlrs 20). They
rely on government stores, where food is cheap _ when there is any.
	   On Saturday, potatoes sold at 40 centavos a pound (2 cents).
Plantains were 30 centavos (1 cent). There was nothing else
available.
	   Down the block, the San Agustin store offered more. There was
cooking oil, blue jeans, canned ham, frozen chicken, rum _ even
electric fans and TV sets. But prices were in dollars.
	   Still, dozens of people jammed up against the bars on the
window, waiting to be let through the door in shifts, a way to keep
down the crowds. Some were customers with relatives abroad who send
them dollars; others got tips from jobs at hotels or, a saleswoman
said, occasionally worked as prostitutes.
	   Cabrera's five-member family lives in a crumbling two-bedroom
rowhouse that has running water every fifth day. Two double beds
are covered with threadbare sheets. A thin veil hangs from the
ceiling to separate the beds.
	   Their ration booklet shows what they bought each month. The page
for July shows purchases of rice, flour, sugar, coffee, cigarettes,
matches and cooking oil.
	   The spaces for toothpaste, detergent, soap, tomatoes and butter
are empty. ``There isn't any to buy,'' Cabrera said.
	   And yet people survive.
	   Cabrera eventually took his 2-year-old daughter to carnival, and
he allowed himself a three-peso (14 cent) liter of beer.
	   ``People invent ways,'' said Miladis, a 25-year-old woman who
wouldn't give her last name. ``So far I haven't seen anyone starve
to death.''

Australia noses out United States in under-23 rowing cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IOANNINA, Greece (AP) _ The United States' mens eight was nosed
out at the finish as America's best hope for a gold medal was
washed away by Australia on Sunday in the finals of the under-23
Nations Cup.
	   The men finished .63 seconds off the pace with a final time of 5
minutes, 54.60 seconds.
	   The womens four was the only other medal winner for the United
States, also finishing second with a time of 6 minutes, 46.69
seconds, 6.43 seconds behind Australia.
	   Twenty nine U.S. athletes compteted in the two-day racing
chanpionships, with four of nine boats making Sunday's final. The
men's lightweight four took fifth in 6:17.99, 12.41 seconds behind
the French winners, while the men's double also reached the final.
	   The U.S. team finished in 10th place overall with 15 points,
while Germany finished on top with 63 points. Italy was second with
51 points and Australia took third with 37. Host Greece was sixth
in the 31-nation event with 18 points.
	   The Nations Cup is designed as a development regatta. The World
Championships will be held Sept. 6-13 in Cologne, Germany.

Violence unabating, Serbian police advance against Kosovo rebels

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In some of the most intense fighting
in months, Serb forces backed by tanks advanced Sunday against
ethnic Albanian rebels, who offered strong resistance to government
efforts to clear key roads in rebellious Kosovo province.
	   Both sides admitted suffering casualties in the fighting, which
has been raging since Friday night along at least three fronts. No
reliable, independent casualty figures were available.
	   Nervous Serb police turned back reporters who tried to reach the
scene of the fighting. Some of the policemen acknowledged that the
Kosovo Liberation Army was putting up a strong fight.
	   Reporters could hear explosions and the rattle of automatic
gunfire reverberating through the hills west of this provincial
capital. Smoke could be seen rising from red-roofed villages.
	   The offensive -- the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April -- appeared aimed at clearing KLA fighters
from three strategic highways: one westward from Pristina to Pec,
another south to the town of Prizren and a third along the Albanian
border in western Kosovo.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, the government radio said Serb
mortar and machine gun fire landed before dawn Sunday in the
Albanian border village of Morina, 220 kilometers (135 miles) to
the northeast, damaging an Albanian customs post.
	   The report mentioned no casualties and there was no confirmation
from the Albanian government.

Dutch to restore development aid to Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ After a six-year hiatus, the Dutch
government plans to restore development aid to Indonesia, Dutch
media reported Sunday.
	   In a letter to Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie asked for Dutch support for an international
assistance package to help the financially-troubled country,
according to the Dutch national news agency ANP.
	   It was ex-President President Suharto who suspended cooperation
and development relations between the two country in 1992 due to
Dutch criticisms of Indonesia's human rights record.
	   Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation Jan Pronk also
postponed parts of an aid package at the end of 1991 when
Indonesian troops attacked demonstrators in East Timor.
	   At that time, Dutch aid to Indonesia, a former Dutch colony,
totaled around 185 million guilders (dlrs 92 million).
	   Pronk believes the human rights situation in Indonesia has
improved under President Habibie and the democratization process
deserves support, reported ANP.

	   SPIELBERG, Austria (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen captured the
accident-filled Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday to pace a McLaren
triumph and increase his Formula One championship lead over Michael
Schumacher.
	   Driving a nearly perfect race, Hakkinen charged to the front
from the start, held off two early challenges by Schumacher and
cruised home for his fifth victory of the season.
	   ``It was an excellent victory,'' Hakkinen said.
	   ``The team played a very important part in this race with their
tactics. The one-stop strategy was ideal for me. I was able to
charge and go flat out. I didn't have any problems,'' the Finn
said.
	   With six races left in the year, Hakkinen has an eight-point
lead over Schumacher, the two-time champion who had won the last
three races.
	   David Coulthard finished second as the McLaren-Mercedes team
re-asserted its dominance.
	   ``Exactly what we wanted,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Coulthard, who also has one win this season, placed second
behind Hakkinen for the fourth time.
	   Schumacher lost the nose cone of his Ferrari when he swerved off
the track but battled back in the damaged car to take third place.
	   Eddie Irvine of Ireland drove the second Ferrari to fourth
place, after slowing down in the last few laps because of brake
problems that allowed Schumacher to pass with with three laps left
in the 71-lap race on the 4.6-kilometer (2.3-mile) A1-Ring.
	   Although it looked like Irvine was easing up let the German
pass, both denied there was any collusion.
	   ``It's natural that he wouldn't make it very difficult for me,''
Schumacher said. ``We were both slowing down because of brake
problems.''
	   Starting from the second row next to Schumacher, Hakkinen
blasted past pole holder Giancarlo Fisichella and Jean Alesi in a
chaotic start to grab the lead at the first corner. Schumacher was
right behind him.
	   ``I just put my foot down and I was in the front in the first
corner,'' Hakkinen said. ``The start is always a gamble but I was
able to make the best of it.''
	   ``I had some brake balance problems at the start of the race and
I was struggling in the corners,'' he said.
	   With Olivier Panis stalled on the starting grid, there were
crashes in the first corner and more accidents in the second that
brought out the safety car.
	   The most prominent victim was Mika Salo of Finland in an
Arrows-Yamaha, whose spinning car bumped into Coulthard in the
second corner.
	   ``I had to come back into the pits and get a new front wing,''
Coulthard said. ``But I was able to rejoin the field at the back
behind the safety car.''
	   ``It's quite easy to pass when you have a quick car,'' said
Coulthard, who zoomed through the field to end up behind Hakkinen.
	   Schumacher tried twice to overtake Hakkinen in the early going,
but the Finn stayed ahead. Schumacher lost the second place briefly
when he braked too late coming into a curve in the first attempt to
overtake, but quickly regained the second spot from Fisichella.
	   However, there was more trouble for the German on lap 18, when
he swerved out in a corner, hit the gravel hard and lost the nose
cone of his Ferrari.
	   ``It was a stupid mistake, I went off the line and hit the dust,
there was nothing I could do.''
	   ``There was less damage than I thought but there was enough
damage,'' he said.
	   ``This was an extraordinary race. Considering what happened to
me, I am extremely satisfied,'' Schumacher said.
	   Schumacher went into the box for a new front wing and battled
back from 16th place.
	   He also had to fight his way past brother Ralf in a Jordan-Mugen
Honda, and nearly went off the course again.
	   Another crash on lap 22 took out Fisichella and Alesi, after
Fisichella's Benetton had bumped into the Frenchman's Sauber
following a pit stop.
	   Ralf Schumacher placed fifth, while defending champion Jacques
Villeneuve of Canada, winner here last year, was sixth in his
Williams.
	   Hakkinen covered the distance of 306.649 kilometers (190.543
miles) in one hour, 30 minutes, 44.086 seconds, averaging a speed
of 202.777 kph (121.666 mph).
	   Coulthard was 5.289 seconds behind, and Schumacher 39.093.
	   By picking up 10 points for his victory, Hakkinen now has 66
points. Schumacher got four points and has a total of 58. Coulthard
remains third with 36.

Tour de France looking to Alps with O'Grady taking stage

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Calcaterra being placed sixth &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) - Stuart O'Grady of Australia, who had the
overall lead for three days earlier in the race, used his sprinting
ability to capture the 15th stage of the Tour de France.
	   Defending champion Jan Ullrich still held the overall lead in
the race, 71 seconds ahead of American Bobby Julich.
	   O'Grady was part of a six-man breakaway that left the pack early
in the day. He just edged Itaian Giuseppe Calcaterra at the line
for the victory.
	   Calcaterra moved slightly into O'Grady in the final line and was
dropped from second to sixth in the stage standings.
	   With a world title in team sprinting and Olympic medals on the
track, O'Grady knew he was expected be strong in the final stretch.
	   ``I knew if it came down to a sprint, they would be watching for
me,'' O'Grady said. ``But I didn't want to have done all that work
in the break and have the win go to someone else.''
	   O'Grady and the five others kept building their lead over the
last 120 kilometers (75 miles) ending up with 10 minutes over the
pack. Sunday's stage was from Valreas to Grenoble, 187 kilometers
(116 miles), the last day before the Alps.
	   With temperatures above 30 C (86 F) and no threats in the group
ahead, the major favorites conserved their strength with the Alps
coming up over the next three days.
	   Of the top six in the stage, Peter Meinert-Nielsen of Denmark
was the closest to Ullrich in the overall standings entering the
day at more than 38 minutes behind. The rest were nearly an hour or
more. So, even with the margin up to 11 minutes at one point, there
was no need for the pack to panic.
	   Meinert-Nielsen came in fourth after Calcaterra was dropped
down, the second top five finish for a member of the U.S. Postal
team.
	   Orlando Rodrigues of Portugal ended up second with Leon Van Bon
of the Netherlands third.
	   Laurent Desbiens, another former yellow jersey holder earlier in
the Tour, was fifth ahead of Calcaterra.
	   Monday's 15th stage from Grenoble to Les Deux Alpes, 189
kilometers (117.5 miles) with four major climbs including two rated
``out of category'' on a scale of steepness, height and length.
	   While the Tour appeared almost racing under normal activity, the
next step of the drug scandal will unfold Monday.
	   The TVM team's director and doctor were ordered jailed over the
weekend. They were expected to be brought to Reims for more
investigation concerning a drug seizure in the car of one of its
officials in March.
	   Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc has said that he will throw the
TVM team out of the Tour, as he did with the Festina team, if there
is any evidance or statements concerning use of prohibited drugs by
the team.
	   Three officials of the Festina team, including the dirctor and
the team doctor, had drug charges against them and were jailed.

	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) - A quick look at Sunday's stage of the
85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE: The 14th stage from Valreas to Grenoble, 187 kilometers
(116 miles), the last day before the Alps.
	   WINNER: Stuart O'Grady became the third Australian to win a
stage, heading a six-man breakaway that finished 10 minutes ahead
of the pack.
	   YELLOW JERSEY: Defending champion Jan Ullrich is in front by 71
seconds over American Bobby Julich with both finishing in the main
pack.
	   HOW THE OTHERS FARED: Laurent Jalabert is still third, 3:01
behind Ullrich. Marco Pantani of Italy is fourth, also 3:01 back.
	   The 1996 winner, Bjarne Riis of Denmark and Ullrich's teammate
on the Telekom team, is 7:00 back.
	   TOUR TIDBIT: The Tour passed through the Vercours region where
some of the fiercest Resistance fighting during World War II
occurred against the Germans because of the many narrow passes and
caves. Nearly every village has a monument to its heros.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``Every dog has his day and I've had a good
couple of weeks,'' Stuart O'Grady who has held the yellow jersey
and taken a stage in this year's race.
	   THE NEXT STAGE: The Tour hits the Alps with the 15th stage from
Grenoble to Les Deux Alpes, 189 kilometers (117.5 miles) with four
major climbs including two rated ``out of category'' on a scale of
steepness, height and length.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES wih unconfirmed report of shelling in Albania in grafs

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In some of the most intense fighting
in months, Serb forces backed by tanks advanced Sunday against
ethnic Albanian rebels, who offered strong resistance to government
efforts to clear key roads in rebellious Kosovo province.
	   Both sides said they suffered casualties in the fighting, which
has been raging since Friday night along at least three fronts.
	   Nervous Serb police turned back reporters who tried to reach the
scene of the fighting. Some police officers acknowledged that the
Kosovo Liberation Army was putting up a strong fight.
	   Reporters could hear explosions and the rattle of automatic
gunfire reverberating through the hills west of the provincial
capital of Pristina. Smoke could be seen rising from red-roofed
villages.
	   The offensive -- the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April -- appeared aimed at clearing KLA fighters
from three strategic highways: one westward from Pristina to
Kosovo's second-largest city, Pec, another south to the town of
Prizren and a third along the Albanian border in western Kosovo.
	   In the Albanian capital, Tirana, government radio said Serb
mortar and machine gun fire landed before dawn Sunday in the
Albanian border village of Morina, 220 kilometers (135 miles) to
the northeast, damaging an Albanian customs post.
	   The report mentioned no casualties and there was no confirmation
from the Albanian government.
	   If successful, the operation would split the estimated one-third
of the province under rebel control and block routes to their
sanctuaries in neighboring Albania from which the insurgents
smuggle weapons.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said police drove KLA
fighters from the villages of Banja and Zociste, site of a Serbian
Orthodox monastery that the guerrillas had controlled since early
this month.
	   The Serbian Media Center said two policemen have been killed and
another two were wounded in fighting south of Pristina toward
Prizren. Serb sources claimed 11 Albanians died in fighting south
of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government forces in
western Kosovo.
	   In its account, the Kosovo Information Center, run by separatist
ethnic Albanians, reported at least 10 Serb policemen have died in
the fighting. The Albanians put KLA losses at one dead and one
wounded.
	   The Albanian center also said eight Albanian civilians have been
killed and about 40 wounded in two days of fighting across the
province.
	   On the road between Pristina and Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles)
to the west, police used bulldozers to clear KLA barricades, made
of dirt, rocks and burned out vehicles, that had blocked the road
for several weeks.
	   Police said the road was still unsafe because it had been mined
with makeshift booby traps. Fighting continued along the road
Sunday.

BT, AT and T form dlrs 10 billion global alliance

	   LONDON (AP) _ British Telecommunications PLC and AT and T said
Sunday they will combine their international telephone operations
and create a new Internet system in a dlrs 10 billion alliance to
put them ``at the forefront of the global information age.''
	   ``We've got the two greatest brands standing shoulder to
shoulder and we think we're going to transform the global
telecommunications industry,'' the BT chief executive, Sir Peter
Bonfield, told a news conference.
	   BT, the biggest British telephone company, negotiated the joint
venture with AT and T, the biggest U.S. carrier, after BT's earlier
plan to merge with MCI Communications Corp. was busted up by a
higher offer from rival WorldCom Inc.
	   To join forces with BT, AT and T will leave two other
international deals: The AT and T-Unisource alliance that has Dutch
Swedish and Swiss partners, and its WorldPartners arrangement, a
loose alliance with other international long-distance companies.
	   ``The merging of our international assets to form this global
venture will enable BT and AT and T to deliver in a unique and
powerful way the seamless global services our multinational
customers need and want,'' said AT and T's president, John D.
Zeglis.
	   The companies said their 50-50 venture, to be named later, will
be based in the eastern United States with some 5,000 employees. It
will be a free-standing company run by executives from both BT and
AT and T.
	   The BT chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, will be its first chairman.
	   The telephone giants estimated that the business will have dlrs
10 billion in revenues and operating profits of dlrs 1 billion in
the first year, which will improve earnings at each company ``from
day one.''
	   The revenues would equal about 13 percent of the combined
turnover of the two companies: AT and T revenues are about dlrs 52
billion annually and BT's revenues are about dlrs 26 billion.
	   The companies predicted 15 percent annual growth after the first
year of operations.
	   Their goal, they said, is to create jobs rather than eliminate
them, although they acknowledged a few overlapping jobs may be in
trouble as the deal comes together.
	   The companies will use their combined international networks to
become a ``carrier's carrier'' for long-distance services offered
by telephone companies operating in numerous markets. BT and AT and
T said that 90 percent of the global telephone market will soon be
open to significant competition, and they want to woo business from
startup phone companies in numerous markets.
	   They will not hold stock in one another, however, and have no
plans to bring other companies in as partners in the joint venture.
	   BT and AT and T said they will be able to ``provide an
outstanding range of global services, far greater than either BT or
AT and T could provide alone or with their current alliances.''
	   The venture will operate in three main areas:
	   _A worldwide voice and data business that offers telephone
networks to multinational corporations and other big instituations.
	   _A global sales and service business that initially will target
corporate clients in the financial, oil and information technology
businesses.
	   _An international carrier services business that will develop
low-cost communications links around the world for both individual
and business customers.
	   In a related development, BT and AT and T also will invest dlrs
1 billion, on a 50-50 basis, in U.S. businesses involved in high
technology and ``emerging communications markets.''
	   After losing its deal with MCI, the No. 2 U.S. long-distance
carrier, BT went straight to the top of the U.S. market in cutting
a deal with AT and T, which has been expanding agressively since
chairman C. Michael Armstrong took over last year.
	   AT and T agreed in June to a dlrs 32 billion merger with U.S.
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., and just last week closed a
dlrs 11.3 billion takeover of Teleport Communications Group.
	   BT's agreed deal to purchase MCI for dlrs 24 billion was outdone
by a dlrs 37 billion offer from WorldCom. The new deal will be
bigger internationally for BT but unlike the deal with MCI, it will
not make BT a player in the domestic U.S. telephone market.
	   BT already has a global partnership with MCI, called Concert,
that BT plans to buy out as WorldCom buys MCI. AT and T will begin
selling Concert services in the United States under the name AT and
T Concert as the bigger deal with BT undergoes regulatory scrutiny.
	   Although the companies will need approval from regulators in the
United States, Britain and the European Union, they predicted they
can close on the deal within one year.

	   GRANJITA SIBONEY, Cuba (AP) _ The ragtag rebels who launched the
Cuban revolution 45 years ago Sunday have returned to the revolt's
cradle to help strengthen the resolve of a people in a troubled
hour.
	   Some of Castro's first followers returned to Granjita Siboney,
the farming village where they spent the night before the 1953
attack on the Moncada barracks that began the uprising, to tell
schoolchildren about the battle and to urge them not to lose faith
in the revolution.
	   ``When we were your age we didn't have even a tenth of what you
now have,'' Pedro Gutierrez, 69, told the children. ``We feel very
proud to have put our grain of sand into defeating the dictatorship
and helping to bring us everything that we have today.''
	   The children craned their necks and listened attentively to the
men who have become national heroes.
	   ``After hearing their words we are more clear about what
happened on that day _ and about what has been happening since
then,'' 13-year-old Ramon Enrique Suarez said.
	   Suarez and 91 other children, selected for their patriotism and
academic achievements, staged a symbolic reenactment of the attack
before dawn Sunday, rushing the barracks in mustard yellow uniforms
and toy rifles as thousands of people looked on.
	   Castro himself was expected in nearby Santiago on Sunday night
to lead the commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the ill-fated
battle considered the start of the uprising.
	   ``The Moncada veterans have won a place in the hearts of all
Cubans, said Anabel Perez, 14. ``After listening to them, we know
we must go forward.''
	   But these are troubled times in Cuba. A decades-old U.S.
economic embargo has taken a heavy toll, and most foreign aid dried
up almost a decade ago with the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
	   Although few people are starving, poverty is widespread and
begging and prostitution are common in the main cities.
	   But the old rebels have few regrets. ``Despite the blockade and
the economic crisis, people are living better than we were in
1953,'' Jose Luis Lopez Villa, 74, said.
	   Gerardo Soza Rodriguez, who was a 24-year-old waiter at the
Tropicana Hotel in Havana when he joined Castro, said he would
always believe in the revolution.
	   ``I feel the same as I did back then,'' he said. ``I'm very
happy about what we have achieved, and we couldn't have a better
leader than Fidel.''

Tamil rebels planned to assassinate President, says newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan detectives uncovered a
Tamil rebel plot to assassinate President Chandrika Kumaratunga
last week during a public appearance in the capital, Colombo, a
Sunday newspaper reported.
	   The report in the independent Sunday Times newspaper appeared
two days before the leaders of seven South Asian nations are to
meet in Colombo for an annual regional summit.
	   The newspaper, known for its investigative reporting, linked the
recent arrest of two Tamil journalists and a Tamil astrology
columnist with the plot. The assassination was to be carried out
when Kumaratunga, the top target of the Tamil Tigers rebel group,
appeared at a Hindu cultural festival in the capital on July 22.
	   But the president canceled the engagement on the advice of the
police and sent a government minister instead, according to the
Sunday Times newspaper.
	   Sri Lanka, an island country off India's southern coast is
wracked by a secessionist war which has claimed at least 54,000
lives since it began in 1983.The rebels are fighting for an
independent homeland for the minority Tamils saying they are
discriminated against in Sinhalese-majority Sri Lanka.
	   The police uncovered plans to assassinate the president and top
government ministers when they interrogated Ganesh Thanarani, a
21-year old Tamil woman arrested in May on suspicion she was
involved with the Tigers.
	   Based on Thanarani's interrogation, police last week arrested
Ponniah Manickavasagar, the principal correspondent for the Tamil
language Virakesari newspaper in Vavuniya, Sandaralingham Sri
Gajan, a Colombo-based reporter for Virakesari and astrology
columnist K. Theivanayagam.
	   Several other arrests were made, the newspaper said without
giving details.
	   The police raided a grocery store in Colombo and seized three
jackets that were filled with explosives and commonly worn by
suicide bombers.
	   The police also found more than 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of
explosives and 25 cyanide capsules in the raid, said the newspaper.
The capsules are the trademark of the Tamil rebels who used them to
commit suicide to avoid arrest.
	   Tamil Tigers have been blamed for assassinating top government
ministers and military officials. Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe
Premadasa was assassinated in 1993 by a suicide bomber. The rebels
have also been blamed for the killing of former Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

Hong Kong Telcom plans to lay off workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., one of the
territory's largest employers, plans to lay off about 1,000
workers, local press reports said Sunday.
	   Radio Hong Kong quoted Cheng Chun-man, chairman of Hong Kong
Telecom's Employees Union, as saying the company plans to ask
middle-level management workers and technicians to retire early or
to leave voluntarily.
	   Cheng said he was asking Hong Kong's Labor Department to help
workers who may be laid off by the company, which is a subsidiary
of Britain's Cable and Wireless PLC.
	   Press reports said the downsizing would affect about 7 percent
of the company's employees.
	   Hong Kong Telecom officials were not available for comment.
	   Earlier this year, the company surrendered its monopoly on
international phone calls after the Hong Kong government agreed to
pay it U.S. dlrs 858 million in compensation.

Nuclear tests to be criticized at Asia-major powers security talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7 and 13 with comments on Japan, India &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos ASEAN101-122 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Social upheavals that could result
from a prolonged Asian economic crisis raised as much concern as
Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests when Asian foreign ministers met
Sunday to discuss regional security with counterparts from outside
powers.
	   The man of the hour was Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi,
soon to be prime minister, who flew to the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations Regional Forum with promises ``for revitalizing the
domestic economy and making a contribution to Asia.''
	   Obuchi, 61, not known for his forceful personality, was
described by a senior U.S. official as ``going out of his way to
say he will be very decisive and dynamic in dealing with the
economic problems.''
	   The official quoted Obuchi as saying, ``I can and I will act. I
will act promptly,'' during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   ``He laid out a fairly comprehensive agenda and said he was
going to move on it very quickly,'' said the senior U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Obuchi said he intended to
follow through on a campaign promise of a dlrs 43 billion tax cut
and a spending stimulus package of about dlrs 71 billion.
	   Earlier in the day, he had told reporters he would choose a
finance minister who could grapple with the bad-debt problems
hanging over Japan's financial sector.
	   ``Under his leadership, Japan will have a strong force for
revitalization of the economy,'' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas told reporters after a late dinner meeting that formally
opened the forum.
	   In other meetings, Obuchi agreed with Russia that high-level
meetings between the two governments would continue on schedule,
and that aid to the Philippines would not be cut back.
	   On her way to the dialogue, Albright emphasized that Asia's deep
and widespread economic trouble is a security problem.
	   ``We strongly urge reform, but we will also do all we can to
help countries that are being hurt by the crisis and that are
committed to reform,'' she had said Friday in California.
	   Meanwhile, Filipino women protested outside the Manila Hotel
where the meetings were taking place, rallying against an accord
that would bring U.S. forces back to the Philippines in joint
military exercises. There have been no U.S. forces visits since
1996, when the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had
shielded U.S. military personnel from prosecution by the
Philippines for crimes committed locally.
	   Albright sought and received assurances from Philippine Foreign
Secretary Domingo Siazon that the new president wished the accord
to pass the Senate. But left-wing groups have said they would hound
Albright with protests until she leaves Wednesday.
	   Australia and Canada joined the ASEAN foreign ministers in
criticizing India and Pakistan for their recent nuclear tests.
Australia said the Regional Forum should condemn the newest nuclear
states in a statement at the end of the meeting Monday, but there
was a split among the delegates over whether strong language might
disrupt relations.
	   But the ASEAN ministers have also said they will press long-term
nuclear powers such as the United States and Russia to set an
example with faster progress on disarmament. ASEAN seeks to create
a nuclear weapons free zone in Southeast Asia, including a ban on
ships carrying the arms through international waters.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   They meet annually in the Regional Forum with Australia,
Cambodia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South
Korea, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Russia and the United States.
	   In addition, Britain and Germany are sending representatives
this year to participate in Post-Ministerial Conferences Tuesday
and Wednesday.

Chinese gymnast unlikely to walk again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BILL FOREMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ Despite successful spinal surgery,
a Chinese gymnast paralyzed after a fall during the Goodwill Games
will probably never walk again, her physician said Sunday.
	   The 7-hour operation performed on 17-year old Sang Lan on
Saturday has enabled her to regain some strength in her shoulders
and biceps, but there had been no improvement in mobility in her
hands and wrists, said Dr. Vincent Leone, director of spinal
surgery at Nassau County Medical Center.
	   Given the complexity of the injury and the healing process, it
was too soon to say how quickly the gymnast would recover and what
her final prognosis will be, Leone told reporters, but it was
unlikely she would ever walk again.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, fell on her head
Tuesday night during a training routine, injuring her spine and
leaving her unable to move her legs.
	   The surgery involved placing three titanium plates with screws
in her neck to stabilize a section of the spine.
	   Surgeons also used bone fragments from her left hip to rebuild
the broken vertebrae.
	   ``The implants basically prevent her head from falling off her
shoulders,'' Leone said.
	   With the implants, Sang was able to sit up in bed, something
impossible before the surgery.
	   Sang is also being treated with an experimental nerve drug
designed to regenerate damaged nerves in her spine. It was too
early to say how effective the treatment has been, Leone said.
	   ``There are just so many different nerve connections that have
to heal,'' he said.
	   Sang will have to stay at the hospital for at least a week under
observation. Her parents, who arrived Saturday from China, have not
decided whether to move her to another hospital or return home.
	   Sang begins rehabilitation Monday.
	   Physicians and others who have visited Sang said that she was in
high spirits Sunday.
	   ``This young lady did not stop talking,'' said Nassau County
Executive Thomas S. Gulotta. ``Her spirit was uplifting, you had to
be encouraged to be in her presence.''
	   Goodwill Games spokesman Michael Lewellen reiterated an earlier

Two Hungarian hostages home after nine months in Chechen captivity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ After nine months in dark basements and
with little food, the two Hungarian relief workers Sunday thanked
all those who contributed to their release by Chechen captors.
	   But the two refused to talk about details of their release.
	   ``We have lost weight but never lost faith to return home,''
Istvan Olah, 48, of the Charity Fund of the Hungarian Church, told
reporters.
	   Olah, and Gabor Dunajszky, 47, were kidnapped on Oct. 23 in
Grozny, where they had been distributing food to about 800 people a
day.
	   Hungarian officials also refused to say much about the
circumstances of the release.
	   ``What I can say is that no ransom was paid, and there was no
open armed operation to free them,'' Hungarian Foreign Minister
Janos Martonyi said.
	   Martonyi refused to say more out of concern for other hostages
stuill in Chechnya.
	   Martonyi also expressed gratitude to those ``who we owe much,
but who want to stay anonymous.''
	   The two former hostages said they were held in different parts
of the capital Grozny, handcuffed and denied basic hygiene.
	   ``For months we only got as much water as we needed for
drinking, not a drop more,'' Olah said.
	   ``The case of the two Hungarians, and those still held hostage
makes it an urgent issue to call an international conference on how
to avoid such kidnappings,'' head of the Hungarian Ecumenical
Charity Fund, Laszlo Lehel said.
	   ``This is all the more important, as there are crises all around
the world and these people want to go and help the helpless,'' he
said.

Chinese gymnast unlikely to walk again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL FOREMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ Despite successful spinal surgery,
a Chinese gymnast paralyzed after a fall during the Goodwill Games
will probably never walk again, her physician said Sunday.
	   The 7-hour operation performed on 17-year old Sang Lan on
Saturday has enabled her to regain some strength in her shoulders
and biceps, but there had been no improvement in mobility in her
hands and wrists, said Dr. Vincent Leone, director of spinal
surgery at Nassau County Medical Center.
	   Given the complexity of the injury and the healing process, it
was too soon to say how quickly the gymnast would recover and what
her final prognosis will be, Leone told reporters, but it was
unlikely she would ever walk again.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, fell on her head
Tuesday night during a training routine, injuring her spine and
leaving her unable to move her legs.
	   The surgery involved placing three titanium plates with screws
in her neck to stabilize a section of the spine.
	   Surgeons also used bone fragments from her left hip to rebuild
the broken vertebrae.
	   ``The implants basically prevent her head from falling off her
shoulders,'' Leone said.
	   With the implants, Sang was able to sit up in bed, something
impossible before the surgery.
	   Sang is also being treated with an experimental nerve drug
designed to regenerate damaged nerves in her spine. It was too
early to say how effective the treatment has been, Leone said.
	   ``There are just so many different nerve connections that have
to heal,'' he said.
	   Sang will have to stay at the hospital for at least a week under
observation. Her parents, who arrived Saturday from China, have not
decided whether to move her to another hospital or return home.
	   Sang begins rehabilitation Monday.
	   Physicians and others who have visited Sang said that she was in
high spirits Sunday.
	   ``This young lady did not stop talking,'' said Nassau County
Executive Thomas S. Gulotta. ``Her spirit was uplifting, you had to
be encouraged to be in her presence.''
	   Goodwill Games spokesman Michael Lewellen reiterated an earlier
pledge by the event's sponsor, Turner Sports, and its parent
company Time-Warner Inc. to provide all possible resources to
secure the family's future.
	   Lewellen said details had yet to be finalized.
	   ``The family has only been here for a few hours,'' he said.
``They haven't had the opportunity to state their wishes.''

	   SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) _ Miguel Cabrera was waiting in a long line
at a dingy market for the only things for sale: potatoes and
plantains.
	   He had waited for two hours, but it was lunchtime and the store
was closing. Cabrera walked away with an empty shopping bag,
wondering what his family of five would eat Saturday.
	   ``Forget it,'' he said. ``I'll try again in the afternoon.''
	   Cabrera wasn't planning to attend Fidel Castro's speech Sunday
night commemorating the anniversary of the battle that began the
Cuban Revolution.
	   ``I don't have time for that. I have things to do at home,'' he
said.
	   Forty-five years after the fight for the Moncada barracks _
Castro's rebels were repulsed, but consider it the beginning of
their 5 1/2-year uprising _ daily life tests many Cubans'
revolutionary spirit.
	   The gap between rich and poor has grown. While most people
praise government health care and education, they also complain
that their government salaries aren't enough to live on.
	   Most blame the three-decade U.S. embargo on their communist
nation, but some are coming to blame the government as well.
	   ``Some people still have hope for the revolution,'' Cabrera
said. Asked about those who don't, he looked away.
	   Still, there are those who support Castro with heartfelt
conviction.
	   ``I love Fidel,'' said Luis Hidalgo Castillo, 52, a toothless
retired construction worker drinking beer outside the Abel Santa
Maria apartment block. ``I adore my revolution. I adore my
government.''
	   Cabrera, an industrial mechanic in Santiago, his wife and his
mother-in-law earn a total of 423 pesos a month (dlrs 20). They
rely on government stores, where food is cheap _ when there is any.
	   On Saturday, potatoes sold at 40 centavos a pound (2 cents).
Plantains were 30 centavos (1 cent). There was nothing else
available.
	   Down the block, the San Agustin store offered more. There was
cooking oil, blue jeans, canned ham, frozen chicken, rum _ even
electric fans and TV sets. But prices were in dollars.
	   Still, dozens of people jammed up against the bars on the
window, waiting to be let through the door in shifts, a way to keep
down the crowds. Some were customers with relatives abroad who send
them dollars; others got tips from jobs at hotels or, a saleswoman
said, occasionally worked as prostitutes.
	   Cabrera's five-member family lives in a crumbling two-bedroom
rowhouse that has running water every fifth day. Two double beds
are covered with threadbare sheets. A thin veil hangs from the
ceiling to separate the beds.
	   Their ration booklet shows what they bought each month. The page
for July shows purchases of rice, flour, sugar, coffee, cigarettes,
matches and cooking oil.
	   The spaces for toothpaste, detergent, soap, tomatoes and butter
are empty. ``There isn't any to buy,'' Cabrera said.
	   And yet people survive.
	   ``People invent ways,'' said Miladis, a 25-year-old woman who
wouldn't give her last name. ``So far I haven't seen anyone starve
to death.''

Guinea-Bissau government, rebels agree to cease-fire, direct talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The government of the West African
nation of Guinea-Bissau and the leaders of a breakaway military
faction agreed Sunday to a cease-fire ahead of direct talks to end
their seven-week-old conflict, according to news reports.
	   The delegations representing President Joao Bernardo Vieira and
rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane signed the pact aboard a
Portuguese Navy frigate, anchored off the coast, after three days
of talks on the ship brokered by diplomats from Portuguese speaking
nations, Lisbon radio TSF reported.
	   Guinea-Bissau is a former Portuguese colony.
	   No date or venue was set for the direct talks, but TSF said they
could be held within 10 days in the Cape Verde islands, about 700
kilometers (430 miles) off the coast of Senegal.
	   Under the deal, the rebels, who claim to have most of the
country's 6,000 soldier on their side, and the government forces,
backed by some 1,300 Senegalese troops, will maintain their
positions while the talks are prepared, TSF reported.
	   The two sides were expected to discuss the deployment of an
international peacekeeping force made up of troops from
Portuguese-speaking countries.
	   The conflict erupted June 7 when a breakaway military faction
occupied the capital's main military garrison and the international
airport, where they are still entrenched.
	   No numbers were available on how many were killed in the
fighting, which also has spread to inland areas of this small
country of about 1 million people.
	   The rebels accuse Vieira of corruption and demand that he step
down.

Hingis battles to send Swiss to finals

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ World No. 1 Martina Hingis labored to a
three-set comeback win over Amelie Mauresmo at the Federation Cup
world group semifinals on Sunday, giving Switzerland an unbeatable
3-0 lead over defending champions France.
	   With her hard-fought 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-2 victory over Mauresmo,
Hingis led the tiny alpine nation to its first world group final
ever.
	   Switzerland will host the final against either the United States
or Spain next September 19-20.
	   Though it was widely expected the 17-year-old would easily
dipose of Mauresmo, ranked 34, several times it appeared Hingis
would disappoint the 8,000 Swiss fans crammed into the Tourbillion
stadium.
	   ``It was very tough,'' said Hingis, in her first tournament
since she was eliminated in the semifinals at Wimbledon. ``Amelie
played a tough match.
	   ``I was suprised by the way she played. I used to wonder with
what she beat the other girls. Today I found out.''
	   The Swiss Miss ran into trouble from the start, as the pair
exchanged four consecutive breaks. Hingis then failed to convert a
crucial set-point at 5-4.
	   Then, leading 4-1 in the tiebreak, Hingis was unable to close
out, allowing instead an impressive Mauresmo to save three
set-points and take a one-set lead.
	   The second set began much the same way, with Mauresmo breaking
Hingis' opening serve to move out to a 3-0 advantage.
	   The tension between Hingis and her mother and team captain
Melanie Molitor during change-overs was clearly visible, the
teenager even flinging a towel back into her mother's face.
	   But then, down 4-1 in front of her home fans, their cowbells
sitting silently at their feet, Hingis' pride and experience came
to the fore, the teenager pulling out all the stops to win the next
five games and the set.
	   Once she'd evened the score, the four-time Grand Slam champion
was not about to let the third set slip through her fingers.
	   Shifting into a higher gear, Hingis immediately broke Mauresmo's
opening serve to jump to a 2-0 lead.
	   As Hingis increased the heat, Mauresmo began to collapse,
allowing the Swiss-sensation to break her again to take a 4-1
advantage.
	   The 19-year-old Mauresmo showed a few last bursts of spirit,
breaking Hingis' serve to decrease the gap to 4-2, but was quickly
broken back on her next service game.
	   ``It's great to be down 7-6, 4-1 and still win the match,''
joked Hingis at a press conference following the match. ``It was
very frustrating at first.
	   ``I think everybody understood what was being said on the bench
even if they didn't speak Czech, but it's better that they don't
know exactly what was said...''
	   The contest marked the first time the two nations met since 1964
when France triumphed 3-0. It is also Switzerland's first time in
the world group since 1994.
	   Patty Schnyder, the only player to win five tournaments this
year, later defeated France's Julie Halard-Decugis 6-3, 6-2 in a
dead rubber, before pairing up with Emmanuelle Gagliardi to beat
France's Alexandra Fusai and Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat
2-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the doubles.

Australia noses out United States in under-23 rowing cup

<TEXT>
	   IOANNINA, Greece (AP) _ The United States' men's eight was nosed
out at the finish as America's best hope for a gold medal was
washed away by Australia on Sunday in the finals of the under-23
Nations Cup.
	   The men finished .63 seconds off the pace with a final time of 5
minutes, 54.60 seconds.
	   The women's four was the only other medal winner for the United
States, also finishing second with a time of 6 minutes, 46.69
seconds, 6.43 seconds behind Australia.
	   Twenty nine U.S. athletes compteted in the two-day racing
chanpionships, with four of nine boats making Sunday's final. The
men's lightweight four took fifth in 6:17.99, 12.41 seconds behind
the French winners, while the men's double also reached the final.
	   The U.S. team finished in 10th place overall with 15 points,
while Germany finished on top with 63 points. Italy was second with
51 points and Australia took third with 37. Host Greece was sixth
in the 31-nation event with 18 points.
	   The Nations Cup is designed as a development regatta. The World
Championships will be held Sept. 6-13 in Cologne, Germany.

Slovakia beats Belgium in Fed Cup play-offs, 4-1

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia is among the first eight
teams in women's world tennis after beating Belgium 4-1 in the Fed
Cup playoffs tournament that ended Sunday.
	   After gaining two points on Saturday, Slovakia secured victory
in the first match on Sunday when Slovak No. 1 Henrieta Nagyova
beat Belgium's Dominique Van Roost.
	   Both Nagyova, who ranks 22nd in the WTA rankings, and Van Roost,
ranked 14th, lost their services in the first four games. Nagyova
won the first set 6-4 after improvig the precision of her shots.
	   In the second set, Van Roost was winning 2-3, when Nagyova
staged a comeback. In her first match-ball, she took the set 6-3,
and with her second victory of the playoffs, gave Slovakia an
unbeatable 3-0 lead with just two matches left to play.
	   ``I'm happy I won both singles gaining two important points. The
advance among the best teams in the world is a success of for the
whole of Slovak tennis,'' Nagyova said.

 &UR; Hingis battles to send Swiss to finals &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with later dead rubbers, last graf &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ World No. 1 Martina Hingis labored to a
three-set comeback win over Amelie Mauresmo at the Federation Cup
world group semifinals on Sunday, giving Switzerland an unbeatable
3-0 lead over defending champions France.
	   With her hard-fought 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-2 victory over Mauresmo,
Hingis led the tiny alpine nation to its first world group final
ever.
	   Switzerland will host the final against either the United States
or Spain next September 19-20.
	   Though it was widely expected the 17-year-old would easily
dipose of Mauresmo, ranked 34, more than once it appeared as if
Hingis would disappoint the 8,000 Swiss fans crammed into the
Tourbillion stadium.
	   ``It was very tough,'' said Hingis, in her first tournament
since she was eliminated in the semifinals at Wimbledon. ``Amelie
played a tough match.
	   ``I was suprised by the way she played. I used to wonder with
what she beat the other girls. Today I found out.''
	   The Swiss Miss ran into trouble from the start, as the pair
exchanged four consecutive breaks. Hingis then failed to convert a
crucial set-point at 5-4.
	   Then, leading 4-1 in the tiebreak, Hingis was unable to close
out, allowing instead an impressive Mauresmo to save three
set-points and take a one-set lead.
	   The second set began much the same way, with Mauresmo breaking
Hingis' opening serve to move out to a 3-0 advantage.
	   The tension between Hingis and her mother and team captain
Melanie Molitor during change-overs was clearly visible, the
teenager even flinging a towel back into her mother's face.
	   But then, down 4-1 in front of her home fans, their cowbells
sitting silently at their feet, Hingis' pride and experience came
to the fore, the teenager pulling out all the stops to win the next
five games and the set.
	   Once she'd evened the score, the four-time Grand Slam champion
was not about to let the third set slip through her fingers.
	   Shifting into a higher gear, Hingis immediately broke Mauresmo's
opening serve to jump to a 2-0 lead.
	   As Hingis increased the heat, Mauresmo began to collapse,
allowing the Swiss-sensation to break her again to take a 4-1
advantage.
	   The 19-year-old Mauresmo showed a few last bursts of spirit,
breaking Hingis' serve to decrease the gap to 4-2, but was quickly
broken back on her next service game.
	   ``It's great to be down 7-6, 4-1 and still win the match,''
joked Hingis at a press conference following the match. ``It was
very frustrating at first.
	   ``I think everybody understood what was being said on the bench
even if they didn't speak Czech, but it's better that they don't
know exactly what was said...''
	   The contest marked the first time the two nations met since 1964
when France triumphed 3-0. It is also Switzerland's first time in
the world group since 1994.
	   Patty Schnyder, the only player to win five tournaments this
year, later defeated France's Julie Halard-Decugis 6-3, 6-2 in a
dead rubber, before pairing up with Emmanuelle Gagliardi to beat
France's Alexandra Fusai and Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat
2-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the doubles.

Israel may give award to insurance firm sued over Holocaust claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with prime minister's advisor. ADDS
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's economic
staff has recommended giving an award to an Italian insurance giant
accused of failing to pay out policies to Holocaust victims, his
office confirmed Sunday.
	   The award is being given to Assicurazioni Generali, based in
Trieste, Italy, along with a number of other companies that made
major investments in Israel, Netanyahu's adviser Bobby Brown said.
Generali purchased control of the Israeli insurance company Migdal
for more than dlrs 200 million.
	   Brown said the list of recommendations, which Netanyahu has not
yet acted on, includes all companies that invested more than dlrs
50 million in Israel.
	   Michael Kleiner, a legislator in Netanyahu's Likud Party, said
the award should not go to a company that has refused to pay
policies of Jews who perished at the hands of the Nazis during
World War II.
	   ``It completely lacks sensitivity to give a prize to the
president of a company which is sitting on the money of Jews who
were killed in the Holocaust,'' Kleiner said.
	   Generali has said it is not liable for the unpaid policies
because many of its east European offices and assets were taken
over by communist governments after World War II.
	   The Italian company is one of 16 European insurance companies
named in a federal class-action suit filed last year in New York.
Another suit was filed in February in a Los Angeles Superior Court
by family members of five Holocaust victims.
	   Some Jewish leaders, however, have praised Generali for actions
such as assisting Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial,
in gathering lists of Holocaust victims.
	   Last year, Generali established a dlrs 12 million fund for
Holocaust survivors. And the company has expressed support for an
international commission to investigate claims by victims and their
families.
	   Brown said he would meet in New York later this week with
representatives of Generali and four other insurance companies to
discuss how to handle Holocaust claims. The discussions have no
connection to the economic award, he said.

Dozens of children vaccinated after English boy dies of meningitis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with name of boy, all children vaccinated

<TEXT>
	   AUDRESSELLES, France (AP) _ Authorities have vaccinated 76
children at a campground near the northern port of Calais, where an
English boy stayed with his family before dying of meningitis,
officials said Sunday.
	   The 5-year-old boy, Matthew Scott of the Newcastle area, died
overnight Saturday at a hospital in the western city of Nantes
where he was admitted Friday night, officials said.
	   Upon learning of the boy's hospitalization, health officials
quickly alerted authorities in Audresselles, where he and his
family stayed at Les Ajoncs campground overnight Tuesday.
	   Seventy-six children were vaccinated there, ``kids who played in
the sand with the young English boy,'' said Marie-Therese Ellart,
the campground manager.
	   By Sunday afternoon, all families that had been at the camp
during the week but left before Saturday's alert were contacted and
their children vaccinated, officials said.

Russia beats Germany 4-1 in Fed Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Russia, playing without stars Anna
Kournikova and Elena Likhovtseva, defeated Germany 4-1 when Tatiana
Panova and Yelena Makarova won their singles matches Sunday in the
Federation Cup World Group I playoffs.
	   Russia was ahead 2-0 after the first day of competition when
Panova outplayed Anke Huber 7-5, 6-3. It was the first tournament
for the 14th-ranked Huber since she withdrew from the French Open
because of an Achilles tendon injury.
	   ``It's always difficult to come back after a three-month
break,'' Huber told reporters after the match. ''It's hard to play
first matches and that's what happened this weekend. It was tough
to play Panova, she was running every ball.''
	   The two were tied at 3-3 in the second set before Huber double
faulted four times and lost the rest of her serves.
	   The victory took Panova's win-loss record in Fed Cup singles to
6-0.
	   Makarova put Russia ahead 4-0 by defeating Andrea Grass 6-4,
6-1.
	   ``I guess the Germans overestimated the role of Huber and put
her in a difficult position,'' said Konstantin Bogorodetsky,
captain of the Russian team.
	   In doubles, Jana Kandarr and Meike Babel of Germany defeated
Yevgenia Kulikovskaya and Yekaterina Sysoeva of Russia 6-4, 6-2.
	   In 1999 Russia will play in the World Group I while Germany will
compete in World Group II.

Tour de France looking to Alps with O'Grady taking stage

 &UR; Eds: For AMs, CORRECTS to 14th stage Sunday &QL; 
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) - The Tour de France concentrated on the
basics for the most part on Sunday with the Alps coming up.
	   With the justice system off on the weekend, no new revelations
on the on-going drug scandal coming out and the riders calming down
after expressing their grief on Friday and Saturday, it seemed like
a normal day on the Tour de France.
	   So Stuart O'Grady of Australia took advantage of the situation
to gain a stage victory to go along with the three days he had in
the leader's yellow jersey last week.
	   Defending champion Jan Ullrich still held the overall lead in
the race, 71 seconds ahead of American Bobby Julich.
	   O'Grady used his sprinting ability to capture the 14th stage
Sunday from Valreas to Grenoble, 187 kilometers (116 miles), the
last day before the Alps.
	   O'Grady was part of a six-man breakaway that left the pack early
in the day. He just edged Itaian Giuseppe Calcaterra at the line
for the victory.
	   Calcaterra moved slightly into O'Grady in the final line and was
dropped from second to sixth in the stage standings.
	   With temperatures above 30 C (86 F) and no threats in the group
ahead, the major favorites conserved their strength with the Alps
coming up over the next three days.
	   O'Grady and the five others kept building their lead over the
last 120 kilometers (75 miles) ending up with 10 minutes over the
pack.
	   ``Over the last 20 K, with the hundreds of thousands of people
cheering, I was praying that `This would be my day,' '' O'Grady
said.
	   ``Every dog has his day and I've had a good couple of weeks,''
O'Grady said.
	   He became the third Australian to win a stage in the cycling
race. Neil Stephens won a stage last year but was kicked out of
this year's race along with the rest of the Festina team in the
doping scandal.
	   Phil Anderson also won for Australia in the 1980s.
	   With a world title in team sprinting and Olympic medals on the
track, O'Grady knew he was expected be strong in the final stretch.
	   ``I knew if it came down to a sprint, they would be watching for
me,'' O'Grady said. ``But I didn't want to have done all that work
in the break and have the win go to someone else.''
	   Of the top six in the stage, Peter Meinert-Nielsen of Denmark
was the closest to Ullrich in the overall standings entering the
day at more than 38 minutes behind. The rest were nearly an hour or
more.
	   So, even with the margin up to 11 minutes at one point, there
was no need for the pack to panic.
	   Ullrich is counting on his teammates to up the pace of the pack
when the real racing is needed in the Alps.
	   ``The spirit on the Telekom team is optimal and physically the
team is at 100 per cent,'' Ullrich said. ``There are people who I
have worked for and I know they will work for me now,''
	   Ullrich came in 37th on the day without losing any time to his
major rivals. The biggest jump came from Meinert-Nielsen who jumped
to 49th in the overall standings, still 28 minutes behind Ullrich.
	   Meinert-Nielsen came in fourth on the day after Calcaterra was
dropped down, the second top five finish for a member of the U.S.
Postal team.
	   Orlando Rodrigues of Portugal ended up second with Leon Van Bon
of the Netherlands third.
	   Laurent Desbiens, another former yellow jersey holder earlier in
the Tour, was fifth ahead of Calcaterra.
	   Monday's 15th stage from Grenoble to Les Deux Alpes, 189
kilometers (117.5 miles) with four major climbs including two rated
``out of category'' on a scale of steepness, height and length.
	   While the Tour appeared almost racing under normal activity, the
next step of the drug scandal will unfold Monday.
	   The TVM team's director and doctor were ordered jailed over the
weekend. They were expected to be brought to Reims for more
investigation concerning a drug seizure in the car of one of its
officials in March.
	   Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc has said that he will throw the
TVM team out of the Tour, as he did with the Festina team, if there
is any evidence or statements concerning use of prohibited drugs by
the team.
	   Three officials of the Festina team, including the dirctor and
the team doctor, had drug charges against them and were jailed.

Kohl's government considering new election-year plan to fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Looking for ways to fight Germany's
chronically high joblessness, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
is considering a plan that would allow long-term unemployed who
take low-paying jobs to continue receiving unemployment benefits.
	   A Labor Ministry spokesman on Saturday confirmed a report in
this week's Der Spiegel newsmagazine, which said a government
working group is drafting plans for a ``combi-wage'' financed
partly by government benefits, to be published before the Sept. 27
election.
	   The spokesman said the group is to finish its work early next
month, meaning there would not be enough time to enact any
proposals until after the election.
	   Germany's double-digit unemployment rate has been the main issue
in this year's election campaign. Kohl has been trailing the
opposition Social Democrats, who accuse him of not doing enough to
put Germans back to work.
	   Kohl, however, has pointed to recent declines in the jobless
rate _ to 10.5 percent in June _ as evidence that his policies are
working and a turnaround is underway.
	   Others, including the chairman of the government's council of
economic advisers, say the drop is due in large part to seasonal
factors and warn it is too soon to talk about a downward trend.
	   Kurt Biedenkopf, the governor of Saxony state and a member of
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, told German radio Sunday that
the recent developments were very gratifying, ``but it would be
false to say that we are over the mountain in reference to the job
market.''
	   Social Democratic chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder told a
party gathering in Bavaria that reducing unemployment would be the
gauge by which he would measure the success of his government, if
elected.
	   ``If we don't manage to considerably reduce unemployment in the
first years, then we haven't earned the right to continue to
govern,'' he said Sunday, while declining to set specific numerical
goals.

Daredevil dies during jump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LANCASTER, Pennsylvania (AP) _ A one-time record-holding
motorcycle jumper died after plummeting from a ramp while trying to
soar 150 feet (46 meters) on an all-terrain vehicle at a motor car
spectacular.
	   Todd Seeley, 35, of Tampa, Florida, missed the ramp during a
jump, landing face down in the dirt at Buck Motorsports Park
Saturday night. He died in the operating room of Lancaster General
Hospital late Saturday, a hospital spokeswoman said.
	   ``His back end just spun out about halfway up that ramp,''
spectator Ross Trimble of Darlington, Maryland, said.
	   Seeley, who held the Guiness Book of World Record from 1988 to
1991 for jumping 246 feet (75 meters) on a motorcycle, started the
evening with a successful 150-foot (46 meters) jump on his stock
motocross cycle.
	   He then geared up for the 150-foot (46 meters) jump on a
four-wheel all-terrain vehicle _ which would have been a record at
the arena. Seeley had jumped 160 feet (49 meters) on an ATV at the
Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, in 1993, for what is
considered the world's record, though Guiness doesn't recognize
that category.
	   As the stunt began, Seeley revved up the squat red-and-white ATV
to reach 65 mph (105 kmh), a shower of golden sparks from a
firecracker trailing behind it. Ahead of him, he aimed for the
12-foot (3.66-meter) wide, 84-foot (25.6-meter) long landing ramp
about 100 feet (30 meters) away.
	   More than 4,000 spectators gasped and rose to their feet as
Seeley came off the ramp _ the ATV visibly pulling left. He shoved
his vehicle away in mid-air, his body clipped the safety catcher
along the ramp's side, and he hit the dirt face down beside the
landing ramp. He didn't move as ambulance crews carried him away.
	   ``The point is to push the limits, but I think Todd was trying
to do too much, more than he'd planned,'' said stunt instructor
Daniel Gajecki of the Kahana Stunt School in Orlando, Florida, who
was traveling with Seeley. ``I told him not to do it, but the crowd
was so in back of him, and he wanted to give them something
extra.''
	   In Seeley's 15-year career _ during which he has participated in
about 60 stunt shows a year _ his worst injury had been a broken
ankle. He also was a professional stuntman, performing in Jim
Carrey's Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and TV's Miami Vice.
	   ``I'm not a daredevil, like Evel Knievel. I'm a professional
stuntman, and every stunt I do is very precise _ practiced,
measured and controlled,'' Seeley said before the event, signing
autographs in his white jumpsuit, emblazoned with red and blue
stars.
	   ``I love doing it. All I ever wanted to do, from the time I was
16, was to ride a motorcycle and make a living doing it.''

Laura Davies wins in Sweden to end 10-month winless slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Laura Davies ended a 10-month winless
slump with a six-shot victory Sunday in the Chrysler Open, a
European tour event.
	   The overnight leader by two shots, Davies three-putted for her
only bogey of the day on the 14th hole. But she hit back with an
eagle on the 15th and a birdie on the 16th in tough, windy
conditions en route to a 3-under-par 70.
	   **That really made it game, set and match,'' she said. **Two
real good holes. That's how I like to play. I like to play
aggressive golf when I'm leading. It's so fun to make eagles.''
	   Davies finished at 284, 8-under-par on the Sjogarde Golfklubb
course. Another Briton, Trish Johnson, also closed with a 70 to
share second with Raquel Carriedo of Spain, who shot a 73. Last
year's U.S. Open champion, Alison Nicholas of Britain, also had a
73 and was alone in fourth at 291.
	   It was the first victory in 10 tournaments in Sweden for the
long-hitting Davies, a former U.S. Open champion and world No. 1.
Her last win was the Hennessy Cup, another European Tour event,
last year.
	   ``This win has certainly lifted my confidence,'' said Davies,
who heads back to North America for the final major of the season,
the du Maurier Classic in Canada starting Thursday.
	   She'll be back for another Swedish tournament in late August.
	   Pernilla Sterner of Sweden, who trailed Davies by two shots
after the third roound, slipped to a 76 and was fifth at 292. Helen
Alfredsson and Carin Koch, two Swedish LPGA Tour regulars, finished
at 297 and 299.

Premier League's foreign legion could weaken England team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Future England soccer teams could become the
victims of the Premier League's insatiable hunger to sign the
world's best players.
	   Arsenal's FA Cup and League double winning manager Arsene Wenger
_ a French import _ says the number of foreign players in the
Premier League will ultimately weaken the England team.
	   Britain's Sunday newspapers were filled with predictions of
England's future woes.
	   The Express on Sunday said only 103 of the 220 players _ less
than half _ expected to start the Premier League season were
English.
	   Wenger told the Express that Premier League teams had to look
abroad for value for money because the transfer market for English
players is ``crazy''.
	   ``Nothing now can stop the arrival of so many foreigners into
the game here and everyone knows that eventually it will kill off
all the young talent,'' Wenger said.
	   ``When that happens, ultimately it can only mean the death of
the national team.''
	   The News of the World said foreigners were killing English
football.
	   ``It is frightening. I don't say England will ever be a third
rate but for me the national team's future is in danger,'' Wenger
told the News of the World.
	   ``The buying of so many foreign players means there is more to
obstruct the careers of of young English players,'' he said.
	   The Arsenal boss admitted he had contributed to the problem _
the Gunners had 12 foreign players on it's books at Highbury.
	   Chelsea's European Cup Winners' Cup winning coach Gianluca
Vialli _ an Italian _ is the leading importer with 16 foreign
players on his books, while Derby has 13, Liverpool has 12 and
Manchester United has 10.
	   Professional Footballers Association chief executive Gordon
Taylor said he had been trying to highlight the problem for years.
	   ``We don't want to be a finishing school for other countries _
the question that should concern all of us is how many (Michael)
Owens have been lost to the game because there was no stage for
them to develop their ability,'' he said.

Seles beats Sanchez Vicario to give U.S. 2-1 lead in Fed Cup semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Monica Seles crushed Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario 6-4, 6-0 on Sunday to give the United States a 2-1 lead
over Spain in the Fed Cup semifinal.
	   Seles, ranked fifth in the world, dominated what was her first
match against world No. 4 Sanchez Vicario since the Spaniard beat
her to take the French Open last month. Sunday's match lasted just
62 minutes.
	   Sanchez Vicario showed her trademark skill in chasing down just
about everything, but she had trouble holding service. After
holding serve to go 2-2 in the first set she did not manage to do
so again for the rest of the match.
	   Seles insisted there no revenge element to her victory.
	   ``I took it as an individual match,'' she said. ``I tried to do
some things differently from Roland Garros.''
	   In the other reverse singles match, Conchita Martinez was to
take on Lisa Raymond later Sunday. After that, Martinez and Sanchez
Vicario were scheduled to face Mary Joe Fernandez and Raymond in
doubles.
	   The team that takes the best of five series goes onto the finals
to face the winner of the Switzerland-France match also being
played this weekend.
	   On Saturday, Raymond started off strong in her singles match
against Sanchez Vicario, taking the first set 7-6 (7-4) and moving
to 2-0 in the second set. But the Spaniard came roaring back to
take that set and the third, 6-3 and 6-0.
	   In the other singles match Saturday, Seles downed Martinez 6-3,
3-6, 6-1.
	   Spain is a powerhouse in Fed Cup play, winning the title four
times between 1991 and 1995.
	   But it is seeking revenge for the 5-0 drubbing it suffered at
the hands of the United States the last time the two countries
played, in the 1996 finals in Atlantic City.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Silvia Farina beat Kvetoslava
Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic 6-2, 6-1 clinching a berth for
Italy in the Federation Cup World Group of women's eight best
tennis teams.
	   Farina broke Hrdlickova in the first game of the match and held
serve to lead 2-0. The young Czech then broke back and leveled at
2-2 but the match turned into a one-sided affair from then on.
	   Farina won sixteen points in a row and broke Hrdlickova twice at
love to win the set 6-2.
	   Serving at 1-1 in the second set, Hrdlickova squandered three
breakpoints, lost the game and second set to the more experienced
Italian 6-1.
	   ``I tried to show my best tennis, but unfortunately I did just
the opposite,'' Hrdlickova said after the match.
	   Farina's vioctory gave Italy an unbeatable 3-0 lead after Italy
won both Saturday's singles.
	   In the second match of the day, Radka Bobkova beat Rita Grande
2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Bobkova took a 2-0 lead in the third set, but Grande turned the
set around leading 5-2. Bobkova then came back to tie the score at
5-5 and eventually force a tiebreak she won 7-5.
	   In the final doubles match Italy's Francesca Lubiani and Flora
Perfetti beat Lenka Nemeckova and Michaela Pastikova of the Czech
Republic 6-2, 4-6, 7-5.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Divers who salvaged antique alcohol
from a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea were in for a few sad surprises
when they completed their arduous mission Sunday.
	   The 92-year-old champagne was still bubbling. But what freight
documents had said was cognac appeared to be just undistilled grape
mash, and the ship itself was in such bad shape that it probably
won't be restored.
	   The alcohol had been lying on the seabed off the southwest coast
of Finland since 1916, when a German U-boat torpedoed the schooner
that was carrying an order for the Russian army.
	   ``The cognac was a disappointment; it was sharp on the palate
and smelled bad,'' said salvage team member Markku Kankaristo by
telephone from the diving site near Rauma, about 250 kilometers
(155 miles) northwest of Helsinki.
	   A French wine grower who tasted the drink said it was grape mash
which had not yet been distilled into cognac, Kankaristo said.
``But the 1906 Hiedsieck Gout Americain champagne was excellent.''
	   According to freight documents, the Joenkoeping (pronounced
YEUN-sheu-ping) schooner was carrying about 5,000 bottles of
champagne, 67 barrels of cognac and 17 barrels of wine when it was
sunk.
	   Divers retrieved some 3,000 bottles of champagne and only 20
barrels of supposed cognac, Kankaristo said.
	   The wreck was discovered last year by a Swedish team of divers
which salvaged several hundred bottles of the champagne.
	   Along with weather problems, the salvage effort was delayed by a
dispute over ownership. Finnish businessman Peter Fryckman laid
claim to the cargo because the company of his great-grandfather was
involved in the order.
	   Fryckman's frogmen recovered hundreds of bottles from the wreck
until a Finnish court ordered him to remove his divers and vessel
from the salvage site, allowing the Swedish-led operation to
continue until the end of the year.
	   After waiting several months for calm weather, frogmen on Friday
attached cables under the wreck and gradually began to hoist it
from a depth of 64 meters (210 feet).
	   ``When we brought it up to the surface, it began breaking up
before our eyes,'' said Kankaristo. ``The hole in its side was
larger than we thought.''
	   ``I think we'll just drop it back into the sea where we found
it,'' he said.
	   The champgne bottles were placed in cold storage before
inspection by Finnish customs officers. Later, they will be shipped
to Sweden or Denmark for sale and auction, Kankaristo said.

	   ROME (AP) _ Colin Dixon's solo home run in the eight inning
Sunday gave Canada a 3-2 comeback win over Russia at the Baseball
World Championship, keeping the North Americans in the race for a
quarterfinal spot.
	   Canada trailed 2-0 after four innings, but reliever Dave Ross
came in to shut down Russia (0-5) with five innings of no-hit
pitching.
	   Outfielder Joe Colameco helped spark Canada (3-2) at the plate,
going 3-for-4 with a triple, and Dixon struck the winning blow.
	   Canada is third in Pool B. Australia leads with a perfect record
after winning its fifth straight game, 6-2 over Taiwan, also at
Palermo, Sicily.
	   Grant McDonald had three singles to raise his tournament batting
average to .450, Nathan Peterson drove in two runs with a double
and Andrew Scott added two hits for Australia.
	   In later action Sunday, the United States (2-2) played a key
Pool B game against Nicaragua (3-1), while the Dominican Republic
(4-0) and Japan (3-1) battled in Pool A.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A bomb exploded in an empty bus parked
at a bus terminal in the New Delhi on Sunday, killing two people
and injuring four others, domestic news agencies reported.
	   The casualties were standing near the bus when the explosion
occurred before noon Sunday. They included the bus driver and his
assistant. Several vehicles parked near the bus were also damaged,
the report said.
	   No one was immediately killed in the explosion, but two people
later died in the hospital from their injuries, according to news
reports.
	   Police suspect the bomb was placed in the back of the bus before
it entered New Delhi from a town in the neighboring state Haryana,
the Press Trust of India reported. The bus had come in just a few
minutes ago and was waiting to pick up passengers for the return
journey.
	   Police said damage from the powerful bomb was limited because
the bus was empty.
	   It was not immediately clear who was behind the explosions, but
police said it could be the work of terrorists. Police beefed up
security around the area and appealed to passengers who had
traveled in the bus earlier Sunday for information on the bombing.
	   Sunday's explosion was the third in the capital this year. One
person was killed and more than 50 were injured in an explosion
outside the police chief's office in central Delhi in January. Two
people were injured in another explosion in June in southern Delhi.

Illegal immigrants fight over food; boat rebuffed in Mediterranean
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Italian coast guard convincing Tunisian
authorities to turn back ship; Dini to discuss problem during
Morocco visit; EDITS to TRIM &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ In the latest tensions over illegal immigration,
police broke up a riot among detained North Africans fighting over
a sandwich on a tiny Sicilian island, and the coast guard Sunday
convinced Tunisian authorities to escort back a boat packed with
would-be immigrants.
	   RAI state TV showed Italian coast guardsmen tossing plastic
bottles of mineral water to some 70 Tunisians crammed into an
open-topped, 13-meter (40-foot) long boat) that was trying to make
it to Italian shores under a broiling sun.
	   Communicating by radio, the commander of the Italian coast guard
ship convinced the Tunisian naval ship to escort back the boat to a
Tunisian port, the ANSA news agency said, reporting from the coast
guard ship. All three boats were in international water.
	   The brawl took place on Lampedusa island, where 147 Tunisians
and Moroccans have been held for two weeks while awaiting
processing to be sent back home.
	   Under the European Union's open borders policy, Italy is obliged
to send illegal immigrants home.
	   RAI state radio reported that the North Africans hadn't had a
hot meal in two weeks and only received bars of soap two days ago.
It said the riot began when a Tunisian refused to give up the
sandwich that was distributed to him to another who demanded it.
	   Italian newspapers reported Sunday that the opposition Northern
League party would start gathering signatures in the Senate Monday
on a petition for a vote of no-confidence against Interior Minister
Giorgio Napolitano.
	   Napolitano has promised aid to North African countries if they
will better patrol their coasts to prevent the nightly exodus to
Italy.
	   The flood of immigrants was expected to dominate Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini's talks in Morocco with officials there
during a visit starting late Sunday.
	   Clandestine arrivals earlier this year by hundreds of Kurdish
refugees from Turkey led to an outcry from Germany, which claimed
Italy was too lax on stopping refugees from reaching Italian shores
and then moving on to northern Europe.
	   Warm temperatures and calm seas this month have aided the
clandestine runs of boats packed with North Africans seeking jobs
in Italy or elsewhere in Europe.
	   Roughly 3,000 people trying to slip in by sea have been tracked
since July 1.

Serbian police advance against Kosovo rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Yugoslav version of Albanian border
incident; CHANGES headline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In some of the most intense fighting
in months, Serb forces backed by tanks advanced Sunday against
ethnic Albanian rebels, who resisted government efforts to clear
key roads in rebellious Kosovo province.
	   The fighting even spilled across the Albanian border,
underscoring international concerns that the conflict could spread
through the volatile southern Balkans.
	   Yugoslav and Albanian sources reported shooting across the
border but gave widely conflicting versions.
	   In Kosovo, both sides admitted suffering casualties in the
fighting, which has raged since Friday night along at least three
fronts. No reliable, independent casualty figures were available.
	   Nervous Serb police turned back reporters who tried to reach the
fighting.
	   Explosions and the rattle of automatic gunfire reverberated
through the hills west of this provincial capital, and smoke rose
from red-roofed villages.
	   The offensive _ the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April _ appeared aimed at clearing Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters from three strategic highways: one
westward from Pristina to Pec, another south to the town of Prizren
and a third along the Albanian border in western Kosovo. The KLA is
fighting for independence for Kosovo.
	   If successful, the operation would split the estimated one-third
of the province under rebel control and block routes to their
sanctuaries in neighboring Albania, from which the insurgents
smuggle weapons.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, government radio said Serb
mortar and machine gun fire damaged an Albanian customs post before
dawn Sunday in the Albanian border village of Morina.
	   The report mentioned no casualties and there was no confirmation
from the Albanian government. The Yugoslav army confirmed the
incident but accused the Albanians of starting it. An army
statement said a Yugoslav customs building and a power line were
damaged.
	   The Yugoslav government's Tanjug news agency said police drove
KLA fighters from the villages of Banja and Zociste, site of a
Serbian Orthodox monastery that the guerrillas had controlled since
early this month.
	   The Serbian Media Center said two policemen have been killed and
another two were wounded in fighting south of Pristina toward
Prizren. Serb sources claimed 11 Albanians died in fighting south
of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government forces in
western Kosovo.
	   In its account, the Kosovo Information Center, run by
independence-seeking Albanians, reported ``at least'' 10 Serb
policemen have died in the fighting. The Albanians put KLA losses
at one dead and one wounded.
	   The Albanian center also said eight Albanian civilians have been
killed and about 40 wounded in two days of fighting across the
province, where Albanians make up 90 percent of the population.
	   On the road between the provincial capital Pristina and Pec, 75
kilometers (45 miles) to the west, police used bulldozers to clear
KLA barricades of dirt, rocks and burned out vehicles that had
blocked the road for several weeks.
	   Police said the road was still unsafe because it was mined with
makeshift booby traps. Fighting continued along the road Sunday,
and the Serbian center said ``armed Albanians are giving strong
resistance.''
	   Success by government troops could open the way for talks on the
province's future between moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The KLA has refused to acknowledge Rugova's leadership because
he opposes violence. U.S. and European mediation has focused on
bringing the two sides to the table.
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' Rugova's Democratic
League of Kosovo said Saturday.
	   Unlike the international community, Rugova backs full
independence for Kosovo. However, the West is promoting him as the
chief Kosovo Albanian representative because he opposes violence.
	   Rugova's renunciation of violence has alienated him from many
Kosovo Albanians. Shabana Shala, a former Rugova aide who defected
to the KLA, said in an interview published Sunday in
Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore that ``Rugova...has lost
validity because he was not capable to fulfill promises and
people's will.''
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Divers who toiled to salvage long-lost
liquor from a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea found a few sad surprises
when they completed their arduous mission Sunday.
	   The 92-year-old champagne was still bubbling. But what freight
documents had said was cognac appeared to be just undistilled grape
mash, and the ship itself was in such bad shape that it probably
won't be restored.
	   The liquor had been lying on the seabed off the southwest coast
of Finland since 1916, when a German U-boat torpedoed the ship that
was carrying an order for the Russian army.
	   ``The cognac was a disappointment; It was sharp on the palate
and smelled bad,'' said salvage team member Markku Kankaristo by
telephone from the diving site near Rauma, about 250 kilometers
(155 miles) northwest of Helsinki.
	   A French wine grower who tasted the drink said it was grape
mash, which had not yet been distilled into cognac, Kankaristo
said. ``But the 1906 Hiedsieck Gout Americain champagne was
excellent.''
	   According to freight documents, the Joenkoeping (pronounced
YEUN-sheu-ping) schooner was carrying about 5,000 bottles of
champagne, 67 barrels of cognac and 17 barrels of wine when it
sunk.
	   Divers retrieved some 3,000 bottles of champagne and only 20
barrels of supposed cognac, Kankaristo said.
	   The wreck was discovered last year by a Swedish team of divers
that salvaged several hundred bottles of the champagne.
	   Along with weather problems, the salvage effort was delayed by a
dispute over ownership. Finnish businessman Peter Fryckman laid
claim to the cargo because the company of his great-grandfather was
involved in the original order.
	   Fryckman's divers recovered hundreds of bottles from the wreck
until a Finnish court ordered him to remove his workers and his
vessel from the salvage site, allowing the Swedish-led operation to
continue until the end of the year.
	   After waiting several months for calm weather, divers on Friday
attached cables under the wreck and gradually began to hoist it
from a depth of 64 meters (210 feet).
	   ``When we brought it up to the surface, it began breaking up
before our eyes,'' said Kankaristo. ``The hole in its side was
larger than we thought.''
	   ``I think we'll just drop it back into the sea where we found
it,'' he said.
	   The champagne bottles were placed in cold storage before
inspection by Finnish customs officers. Later, they will be shipped
to Sweden or Denmark for sale and auction, Kankaristo said.

Kohl's party attacks opposition for overture to former communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats attacked the opposition Social Democrats on Sunday for
giving party leaders in eastern Germany a green light to cooperate
on the state level with former communists.
	   ``Democrats can't cooperate with extremists from the right-wing
or left-wing,'' said Erwin Teufel, governor of the western state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg.
	   His Christian Democratic colleague in the eastern state of
Saxony, Gov. Kurt Biedenkopf, said the Party of Democratic
Socialism, successor party to the east German communists, has not
the slightest interest in making a success out of German
unification.
	   ``Getting involved for governing purposes with such a party
means blocking oneself,'' he said.
	   They were responding to comments published Saturday from Franz
Muentefering, the Social Democrats party whip in federal
parliament.
	   He told the Leipziger Volkszeitung that he and other national
party leaders were wrong to oppose attempts by their party
colleagues in eastern Germany to cooperate with the PDS.
	   ``Whoever is given the responsibility by the voters must decide
for himself how to deal with the results of the election,'' he told
the newspaper.
	   Reinhard Hoeppner, the Social Democratic governor of eastern
Saxony-Anhalt state, faced hefty criticism after forming a minority
government tolerated by the PDS after state elections in April. He
had sought but failed to reach agreement with the Christian
Democrats on forming a grand coalition.
	   Kohl has called the PDS a danger for Germany and has sought to
win votes in western Germany by suggesting the Social Democrats
would ally with them in the federal parliament.
	   Social Democratic chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder, who
leads Kohl ahead of the Sept. 27 national election, has ruled out
such cooperation on the federal level.
	   The former communists get almost no votes in the west, but have
significant support in the economically struggling east, where
unemployment is twice that of the west.
	   The party finished the Saxony-Anhalt elections with 19 percent
of the vote, only 3 percent less than Kohl's party got.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Silvia Farina beat Kvetoslava
Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic 6-2, 6-1 clinching a berth for
Italy in the Federation Cup World Group of women's eight best
tennis teams.
	   Farina broke Hrdlickova in the first game of the match and held
serve to lead 2-0. The young Czech then broke back and leveled at
2-2 but the match turned into a one-sided affair from then on.
	   Farina won sixteen points in a row and broke Hrdlickova twice at
love to win the set 6-2.
	   Serving at 1-1 in the second set, Hrdlickova squandered three
breakpoints, lost the game and second set to the more experienced
Italian 6-1.
	   ``I tried to show my best tennis, but unfortunately I did just
the opposite,'' Hrdlickova said after the match.
	   Farina's vioctory gave Italy an unbeatable 3-0 lead after Italy
won both Saturday's singles.
	   In the second match of the day, Radka Bobkova beat Rita Grande
2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Bobkova took a 2-0 lead in the third set, but Grande turned the
set around leading 5-2. Bobkova then came back to tie the score at
5-5 and eventually force a tiebreak she won 7-5.
	   In the final doubles match Italy's Francesca Lubiani and Flora
Perfetti beat Lenka Nemeckova and Michaela Pastikova of the Czech
Republic 6-2, 4-6, 7-5.

Palestinian negotiator: Israel presented new ideas in secret talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Palestinian negotiator said that Israel did not
bring new ideas to the table and did not confirm meeting Saturday
meeting; Changes in graf 4 Erekat says leadership meeting to
discuss situation in peace talks; RECASTS lead to change
attribution for meeting to defense ministry spokesman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister met secretly with
Yasser Arafat's top deputy and bilateral talks between the sides
were expected to resume shortly, an aide to the defense minister
said Sunday.
	   Palestinian negotiators would not discuss the meeting but Avi
Beniahu, an aide to Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the
minister met with Mahmoud Abbas late Saturday in the Jerusalem area
and agreed that their negotiating teams would reconvene shortly.
	   Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator would not confirm
the meeting had taken place. He told Israel radio in Arabic that
Israeli negotiators ``haven't brought any new ideas at all,'' to
further discussions on a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal.
	   Israel's Army Radio said talks would resume on Monday.
	   Palestinian leaders were to meet late Sunday night in the Gaza
Strip to discuss the current situation in peace talks, Erekat told
The Associated Press.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have been deadlocked over an overdue
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Israel has rejected an American initiative, widely reported but
never formally unveiled, calling for it to withdraw from another
13.1 percent of the West Bank. Arafat has accepted the proposal.
	   Last week the two sides held their first high-level face-to-face
meetings in months at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, but the talks concluded with both sides asking
the United States to step in again.
	   U.S. officials, however, have indicated that the two sides need
to work out their differences themselves before the Americans
become involved again.
	   Abbas was scheduled to meet Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani on Monday, but the two were to discuss smaller,
day-to-day problems rather than the troop pullback terms.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman warned Sunday that the situation
was approaching an ``explosion.''
	   ``The two sides _ the Palestinians and we _ are approaching a
moment when we will have no choice but to do something,'' he told
Israel Radio. ``Otherwise, there will soon be _ maybe it's a harsh
word _ some kind of explosion.''
	   Weizman, whose position is largely ceremonial, repeated his call
for early elections because of the stalemate in the peace process.
	   ``There is a need for a shakeup,'' he said.
	   Also Sunday, dozens of peace activists demonstrated at
intersections around Israel, calling on Netanyahu to go ahead with
the West Bank troop withdrawal.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yugoslav version of Albanian border incident;
CHANGES overline. TRIMS. EDITS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In some of the most intense fighting
in months, Serb forces backed by tanks advanced Sunday against
ethnic Albanian rebels, who resisted government efforts to clear
key roads in the rebellious Kosovo province.
	   The fighting even spilled across the Albanian border,
underscoring international concerns that the conflict could spread
throughout the volatile southern Balkans.
	   Yugoslav and Albanian sources both reported shooting across the
border, but gave widely conflicting versions.
	   In Kosovo, both sides admitted suffering casualties in the
fighting, which has raged since Friday night along at least three
fronts. No reliable, independent casualty figures were available.
	   Nervous Serb police turned back reporters who tried to reach the
fighting.
	   Explosions and the rattle of automatic gunfire reverberated
through the hills west of this provincial capital, and smoke rose
from red-roofed villages.
	   The offensive _ the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April _ appeared aimed at clearing Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters from three strategic highways: one
westward from the provincial capital of Pristina to Pec, another
south to the town of Prizren and a third along the Albanian border
in western Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanian KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo,
a province of Serbia, which is part of the Yugoslav federation.
About 90 percent of the 2 million people living in Kosovo are
ethnic Albanian.
	   The government offensive, if successful, would split the
estimated one-third of the province under rebel control and block
routes to their sanctuaries in neighboring Albania, from which the
insurgents smuggle weapons.
	   In the Albanian capital, Tirana, government radio said Serb
mortar and machine gunfire damaged an Albanian customs post before
dawn Sunday in the Albanian border village of Morina.
	   The report mentioned no casualties and there was no confirmation
from the Albanian government. The Yugoslav army confirmed the
incident but accused the Albanians of starting it. An army
statement said a Yugoslav customs building and a power line had
been damaged.
	   The Yugoslav government's Tanjug news agency said police drove
KLA fighters from the villages of Banja and Zociste, site of a
Serbian Orthodox monastery that the guerrillas had controlled since
early this month.
	   The Serbian Media Center said two policemen have been killed and
another two were wounded in fighting south of Pristina toward
Prizren. Serb sources claimed 11 Albanians died in fighting south
of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government forces in
western Kosovo.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by independence-seeking
Albanians, reported ``at least'' 10 Serb policemen have died in the
fighting. The Albanians put KLA losses at one dead and one wounded.
	   The Albanian center also said eight Albanian civilians have been
killed and about 40 wounded in two days of fighting across the
province, where Albanians make up 90 percent of the population.
	   On the road between Pristina and Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles)
away, police used bulldozers to clear KLA barricades of dirt, rocks
and burned out vehicles that had blocked the road for several
weeks.
	   Police said the road was still unsafe because it was mined with
makeshift booby traps. Fighting continued along the road Sunday,
and the Serbian center said ``armed Albanians are giving strong
resistance.''
	   Success by government troops could open the way for talks on the
province between moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The KLA has refused to acknowledge Rugova's leadership because
he opposes violence.
	   Unlike the international community, Rugova backs full
independence for Kosovo. However, the West is promoting him as the
chief Kosovo Albanian representative because he opposes violence.

Cleaves out, Langdon in for Team USA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Mateen Cleaves, the Big 10 Player of the Year, was
dropped Sunday from the U.S. roster for the Basketball World
Championship because of a sprained ankle.
	   He'll be replaced by Duke's Trajan Langdon, one of the last
three players cut when the team was pared to 12 last week, Team USA
spokesman Craig Miller said.
	   Langdon will join the U.S. team Monday in Athens, Greece, where
the championship opens Wednesday. He was a third-team All-American
last season as a junior.
	   Cleaves hurt the ankle Saturday night in the second half of an
80-75 exhibition game win over Italy. The Michigan State guard
became entangled with teammate Wendell Alexis after trying an
off-balance, no-look pass near the baseline
	   ``It is a very unfortunate situation for Mateen. He was playing
well, playing hard and was our youngest player,'' said U.S. coach
Rudy Tomjanovich, of the Houston Rockets.
	   ``It's a big loss for us. Mateen's a great defender,'' said
Michael Hawkins, who had five key points down the stretch against
Italy.
	   Cleaves, a 6-foot-2 (1.85-meter) junior-to-be, was the only
college player who made the final cut.
	   USA Basketball initially selected 12 NBA players for the world
championship team, including Grant Hill, Tim Duncan and Kevin
Garnett. But with a lockout looming July 1, the All-Stars

Olympic chief Samaranch says doping list must be cut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds reaction from Britsh Olympic Association head last grafs

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The actual list of banned doping products
must be slashed and substances that don't damage an athlete's
health should not be prohibited, Olympic chief Juan Antonio
Samaranch said in an interview with a Spanish paper published
Sunday.
	   For the International Olympic Committee chairman, the recent
scandal involving the Festina team in the Tour de France is ``a
tough blow for cycling and for all sports,'' he told El Mundo
newspaper.
	   ``But the ones to blame are not the athletes but those around
them,'' he said. ``Doping demands an exact definition...and I have
been asking for it for years.''
	   He denied that the IOC has considered legalizing doping but
argued that ``the actual list of (banned) products must be reduced
drastically.
	   ``Doping (now) is everything that, firstly, is harmful to an
athlete's health and, secondly, artificially augments his
performance,'' Samaranch said.
	   ``If it's just the second case, for me that's not doping. If
it's the first case, it is,'' he added.
	   As for the immediate future, he said he didn't think blood
tests, instead of urine ones, would be a solution.
	   Samaranch insisted that although Tour de France episode was
particularly embarrassing, the overall situation was fairly
healthy.
	   ``For example, in the World Cup there were more than 60 games
and nearly 300 doping controls carried out, but not one player
tested positive,'' he told the paper.
	   The Festina cycling team, long ranked as one of the world's
best, was kicked out of the Tour de France after the team's
director admitted the team had supplied banned substances with
medical supervision to improve performances.
	   Last week saw the scandal widening when it was reported that
customs officials found the banned drug EPO in a car of officials
from the Dutch team TVM in March.
	   Samaranch denied that the IOC was in a position to impose a
change and said it needed the collaboration of all. A major turning
point for the Olympics, he said, was in the Seoul Games in 1988
when top athlete Ben Johnson was suspended.
	   ''Some said it was a bad day for sport. We said the opposite,''
Samaranch told El Mundo. ``And since then we have seen that we are
not alone in the struggle. We have been joined by federations and
sports groups of all sorts and, as the Tour showed, even by
governments.''
	   British Olympic Association chief executive Simon Clegg said the
comments attributed to Samaranch were against the BOA's current
thinking.
	   ``The BOA feels very strongly and has been one of the main
bodies in this fight against drugs _ so I look forward to hearing
exactly what the president of the IOC has said,'' Clegg said Sunday
	   ``It is BOA policy that any athlete who has proved positive for
a performance-enhancing drug with the IOC is ineligible to
represent Great Britain at any time in the future.''
	   Clegg said Samaranch's distinction between ``harmful'' and
merely ``performance-enhancing'' drugs is a dangerous path to tread
for sportsmen and administrators alike.

Iran says its new missile is not for first strike

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's new missile is not to be used in a
first strike attack on others, Iran's Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
	   Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi dismissed what he called
``the propaganda launched by some Western media against Iran''
after Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani announced Saturday that Iran
had successfully tested a missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers
(800 miles), known as Shahab-3.
	   Israel and the United States have expressed concern about the
missile, which was tested Wednesday, as it is capable of hitting
Israeli cities or U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
	   In a statement to the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
Mohammadi said Iran had developed its missile technology solely for
defensive purposes and not to launch a first strike against other
countries.
	   ``The Islamic Republic of Iran also reiterates its commitment to
the conventions and international treaties regarding weapons of
mass destruction and categorically denies the irresponsible
statements in international media claiming that Shahab missiles are
equipped with non-conventional warheads,'' the statement said.
	   Newspaper editorials said Sunday that the missile would prevent
any country from imposing its will on Iran.
	   ``One of the basic principles of the Islamic revolution is to be
independent and not accept the hegemony of any power,'' the Tehran
Times said.
	   Iran News's editorial said neighboring states had nothing to
fear.
	   ``Iran's relations with the neighboring states are so warm and
cordial that these countries are not concerned with Iranian
missiles,'' the paper said. ``Rather, they consider them weapons to
defend their interests.''
	   The paper said that Iran's military budget was among the lowest
in the region and that most of its allocations were for defensive
purposes.
	   The Shahab-3 is believed based on North Korea's No Dong missile,
but it remains unclear if Iran purchased equipment or technology
from the North Koreans.
	   Reports from Washington indicate that the CIA believed Iran was
getting substantial missile technology from Russia, and some from
China.

 &UR; Serbian police advance against Kosovo rebels
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Yugoslav version of Albanian border
incident; CHANGES headline.
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In some of the most intense fighting
in months, Serb forces backed by tanks advanced Sunday against
ethnic Albanian rebels, who resisted government efforts to clear
key roads in rebellious Kosovo province.
	   The fighting even spilled across the Albanian border,
underscoring international concerns that the conflict could spread
through the volatile southern Balkans.
	   Yugoslav and Albanian sources reported shooting across the
border but gave widely conflicting versions.
	   In Kosovo, both sides admitted suffering casualties in the
fighting, which has raged since Friday night along at least three
fronts. No reliable, independent casualty figures were available.
	   Nervous Serb police turned back reporters who tried to reach the
fighting.
	   Explosions and the rattle of automatic gunfire reverberated
through the hills west of this provincial capital, and smoke rose
from red-roofed villages.
	   The offensive _ the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April _ appeared aimed at clearing Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters from three strategic highways: one
westward from Pristina to Pec, another south to the town of Prizren
and a third along the Albanian border in western Kosovo. The KLA is
fighting for independence for Kosovo.
	   If successful, the operation would split the estimated one-third
of the province under rebel control and block routes to their
sanctuaries in neighboring Albania, from which the insurgents
smuggle weapons.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, government radio said Serb
mortar and machine gun fire damaged an Albanian customs post before
dawn Sunday in the Albanian border village of Morina.
	   The report mentioned no casualties and there was no confirmation
from the Albanian government. The Yugoslav army confirmed the
incident but accused the Albanians of starting it. An army
statement said a Yugoslav customs building and a power line were
damaged.
	   The Yugoslav government's Tanjug news agency said police drove
KLA fighters from the villages of Banja and Zociste, site of a
Serbian Orthodox monastery that the guerrillas had controlled since
early this month.
	   The Serbian Media Center said two policemen have been killed and
another two were wounded in fighting south of Pristina toward
Prizren. Serb sources claimed 11 Albanians died in fighting south
of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government forces in
western Kosovo.
	   In its account, the Kosovo Information Center, run by
independence-seeking Albanians, reported ``at least'' 10 Serb
policemen have died in the fighting. The Albanians put KLA losses
at one dead and one wounded.
	   The Albanian center also said eight Albanian civilians have been
killed and about 40 wounded in two days of fighting across the
province, where Albanians make up 90 percent of the population.
	   On the road between the provincial capital Pristina and Pec, 75
kilometers (45 miles) to the west, police used bulldozers to clear
KLA barricades of dirt, rocks and burned out vehicles that had
blocked the road for several weeks.
	   Police said the road was still unsafe because it was mined with
makeshift booby traps. Fighting continued along the road Sunday,
and the Serbian center said ``armed Albanians are giving strong
resistance.''
	   Success by government troops could open the way for talks on the
province's future between moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The KLA has refused to acknowledge Rugova's leadership because
he opposes violence. U.S. and European mediation has focused on
bringing the two sides to the table.
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' Rugova's Democratic
League of Kosovo said Saturday.
	   Unlike the international community, Rugova backs full
independence for Kosovo. However, the West is promoting him as the
chief Kosovo Albanian representative because he opposes violence.
	   Rugova's renunciation of violence has alienated him from many
Kosovo Albanians. Shabana Shala, a former Rugova aide who defected
to the KLA, said in an interview published Sunday in
Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore that ``Rugova...has lost
validity because he was not capable to fulfill promises and
people's will.''
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister met secretly with
Yasser Arafat's top deputy and bilateral talks between the sides
were expected to resume shortly, an aide to the defense minister
said Sunday.
	   Palestinian negotiators would not discuss the meeting, but Avi
Beniahu, an aide to Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, said the
minister met with Mahmoud Abbas late Saturday in the Jerusalem area
and agreed that their negotiating teams would reconvene shortly.
	   Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator would not confirm
the meeting. He told Israel radio in Arabic that Israeli
negotiators ``haven't brought any new ideas at all,'' to further
discussions on a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal.
	   Israel's Army Radio said talks would resume on Monday.
	   Palestinian leaders were to meet late Sunday night in the Gaza
Strip to discuss the current situation in peace talks, Erekat told
The Associated Press.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have been deadlocked over an overdue
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Israel has rejected an American initiative, widely reported but
never formally unveiled, calling for it to withdraw from another
13.1 percent of the West Bank. Arafat has accepted the proposal.
	   Last week the two sides held their first high-level face-to-face
meetings in months at the request of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. The talks concluded with both sides asking the
United States to step in again.
	   U.S. officials, however, have indicated that the two sides need
to work out their differences themselves before the Americans
become involved again.
	   Abbas was scheduled to meet Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani on Monday, but the two were to discuss smaller,
day-to-day problems, rather than the troop pullback terms.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman warned Sunday that the situation
could become dangerous.
	   ``The two sides _ the Palestinians and we _ are approaching a
moment when we will have no choice but to do something,'' he told
Israel Radio. ``Otherwise, there will soon be _ maybe it's a harsh
word _ some kind of explosion.''
	   Weizman, whose position is largely ceremonial, repeated his call
for early elections because of the stalemate in the peace process.
	   ``There is a need for a shakeup,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Divers who toiled to salvage long-lost
liquor from a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea found a few sad surprises
when they completed their arduous mission Sunday.
	   The 92-year-old champagne was still bubbling. But what freight
documents had said was cognac appeared to be just undistilled grape
mash, and the ship itself was in such bad shape that it probably
won't be restored.
	   The liquor had been lying on the seabed off the southwest coast
of Finland since 1916, when a German U-boat torpedoed the ship that
was carrying an order for the Russian army.
	   ``The cognac was a disappointment; It was sharp on the palate
and smelled bad,'' said salvage team member Markku Kankaristo by
telephone from the diving site near Rauma, about 250 kilometers
(155 miles) northwest of Helsinki.
	   A French wine grower who tasted the drink said it was grape
mash, which had not yet been distilled into cognac, Kankaristo
said. ``But the 1906 Heidsieck Gout Americain champagne was
excellent.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In some of the most intense fighting
in months, Serb forces backed by tanks advanced Sunday against
ethnic Albanian rebels, who resisted government efforts to clear
key roads in rebellious Kosovo province.
	   The fighting at one point spilled across the Albanian border,
with Yugoslav and Albanian officials reporting an exchange of fire
across the mountainous frontier early Sunday.
	   There was no report of casualties and each side blamed the other
for shooting first. The incident heightened fears that fighting
could spread elsewhere in the volatile Balkan region.

since early this month.
	   The Serbian Media Center said two policemen have been killed and
another two were wounded in fighting south of Pristina toward
Prizren. Serb sources claimed 11 Albanians died in fighting south
of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to government forces in
western Kosovo.
	   In its account, the Kosovo Information Center, run by
independence-seeking Albanians, reported ``at least'' 10 Serb
policemen have died in the fighting. The Albanians put KLA losses
at one dead and one wounded.
	   The Albanian center also said eight Albanian civilians have been
killed and about 40 wounded in two days of fighting across the
province, where Albanians make up 90 percent of the population.
	   On the road between the provincial capital Pristina and Pec, 75
kilometers (45 miles) to the west, police used bulldozers to clear
KLA barricades of dirt, rocks and burned out vehicles that had
blocked the road for several weeks.
	   Police said the road was still unsafe because it was mined with
makeshift booby traps. Fighting continued along the road Sunday,
and the Serbian center said ``armed Albanians are giving strong
resistance.''
	   Success by government troops could open the way for talks on the
province's future between moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The KLA has refused to acknowledge Rugova's leadership because
he opposes violence. U.S. and European mediation has focused on
bringing the two sides to the table.
	   ``We call on the United States, NATO, the United Nations and
European Union to urgently put pressure and take decisive steps
against Belgrade to stop the offensive,'' Rugova's Democratic
League of Kosovo said Saturday.
	   Unlike the international community, Rugova backs full
independence for Kosovo. However, the West is promoting him as the
chief Kosovo Albanian representative because he opposes violence.
	   Rugova's renunciation of violence has alienated him from many
Kosovo Albanians. Shabana Shala, a former Rugova aide who defected
to the KLA, said in an interview published Sunday in
Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore that ``Rugova...has lost
validity because he was not capable to fulfill promises and
people's will.''
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.

Belarus beats Venezuela 4-1 in Fed Cup

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Olga Barabanschikova of Belarus defeated
Milagros Sequera of Venezuela in straight sets 6-3, 6-2 Sunday
giving Belarus a 4-1 win over Venezuela and a place in World Group
II.
	   With Belarus ahead 2-0, the country's top player and Wimbledon
semifinalist Natasha Zvereva was outplayed by Maria Alexandra Vento
who took a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 win.
	   Zvereva looked tired and seldom approached the net. ``I felt bad
and lost concentration on the court,'' Zvereva said after the
match.
	   Vento, currently ranked 35th in the world, said Zvereva's lack
of concentration was the key to her victory. ``Natasha stuck to the
back line and her tactics were very convenient for me,'' she said.
	   For Barabanschikova, who defeated Vento on Saturday 6-2, 6-2, it
was her first appearance in the National Olympic Training Center in
2 1/2 years. ``I understood how much depended on my play and did my
best,'' she said of her victory.
	   In doubles play, Barabanschikova and Nadezhda Ostrovskaya of
Belarus defeated Vento and Sequera, 7-5, 6-3.

Serbian police advance against Kosovo rebels

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Albanians confirming border incident &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In some of the most intense fighting
in months, Serb forces backed by tanks advanced Sunday against
ethnic Albanian rebels, who resisted government efforts to clear
key roads in the rebellious Kosovo province.
	   The fighting even spilled across the Albanian border,
underscoring international concerns that the conflict could spread
throughout the volatile southern Balkans.
	   Yugoslav and Albanian sources both reported shooting across the
border, but gave widely conflicting versions.
	   In Kosovo, both sides admitted suffering casualties in the
fighting, which has raged since Friday night along at least three
fronts. No reliable, independent casualty figures were available.
	   Nervous Serb police turned back reporters who tried to reach the
fighting.
	   Explosions and the rattle of automatic gunfire reverberated
through the hills west of this provincial capital, and smoke rose
from red-roofed villages.
	   The offensive _ the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April _ appeared aimed at clearing Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters from three strategic highways: one
westward from the provincial capital of Pristina to Pec, another
south to the town of Prizren and a third along the Albanian border
in western Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanian KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo,
a province of Serbia, which is part of the Yugoslav federation.
About 90 percent of the 2 million people living in Kosovo are
ethnic Albanian.
	   The government offensive, if successful, would split the
estimated one-third of the province under rebel control and block
routes to their sanctuaries in neighboring Albania, from which the
insurgents smuggle weapons.
	   In the Albanian capital, Tirana, government radio said Serb
mortar and machine gunfire damaged an Albanian customs post before
dawn Sunday in the Albanian border village of Morina.
	   Albanian Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhja confirmed the
report and accused Yugoslav troops of trying to cross the frontier.
	   The Yugoslav army also reported the incident, but said the
shooting began from the Albanian side and that a Yugoslav customs
building and a power line were damaged.

Iran says its new missile is not for first strike

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's new missile is a defensive weapon
that will not be used in a first strike attack on other countries,
Iran's Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
	   Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi dismissed what he called
``the propaganda launched by some Western media against Iran''
after Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani announced Saturday that Iran
had successfully tested the Shahab-3 missile with a range of 1,300
kilometers (800 miles).
	   Israel and the United States have expressed concern about the
missile, which was tested Wednesday, because it is capable of
reaching Israeli cities and U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
	   In a statement to the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
Mohammadi said Iran had developed its missile technology solely for
defensive purposes and not to launch a first strike against other
countries.
	   ``The Islamic Republic of Iran also reiterates its commitment to
the conventions and international treaties regarding weapons of
mass destruction and categorically denies the irresponsible
statements in international media claiming that Shahab missiles are
equipped with non-conventional warheads,'' the statement said.
	   Newspaper editorials said Sunday that the missile would prevent
any country from imposing its will on Iran.
	   ``One of the basic principles of the Islamic revolution is to be
independent and not accept the hegemony of any power,'' the Tehran
Times said.
	   Iran News' editorial said neighboring states had nothing to
fear.
	   ``Iran's relations with the neighboring states are so warm and
cordial that these countries are not concerned with Iranian
missiles,'' the paper said. ``Rather, they consider them weapons to
defend their interests.''
	   The paper said that Iran's military budget was among the lowest
in the region and that most of its allocations were for defense.
	   The Shahab-3 is believed to be based on North Korea's No Dong
missile, but it remains unclear if Iran purchased equipment or
technology from the North Koreans.
	   Reports from Washington indicate that the CIA believed Iran was
getting substantial missile technology from Russia, and some from
China.

Chinese gymnast unlikely to walk again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix cycle designator &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL FOREMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ Despite successful spinal surgery,
a Chinese gymnast paralyzed after a fall during the Goodwill Games
will probably never walk again, her physician said Sunday.
	   The 7-hour operation performed on 17-year old Sang Lan on
Saturday has enabled her to regain some strength in her shoulders
and biceps, but there had been no improvement in mobility in her
hands and wrists, said Dr. Vincent Leone, director of spinal
surgery at Nassau County Medical Center.
	   Given the complexity of the injury and the healing process, it
was too soon to say how quickly the gymnast would recover and what
her final prognosis will be, Leone told reporters, but it was
unlikely she would ever walk again.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, fell on her head
Tuesday night during a training routine, injuring her spine and
leaving her unable to move her legs.
	   The surgery involved placing three titanium plates with screws
in her neck to stabilize a section of the spine.
	   Surgeons also used bone fragments from her left hip to rebuild
the broken vertebrae.
	   ``The implants basically prevent her head from falling off her
shoulders,'' Leone said.
	   With the implants, Sang was able to sit up in bed, something
impossible before the surgery.
	   Sang is also being treated with an experimental nerve drug
designed to regenerate damaged nerves in her spine. It was too
early to say how effective the treatment has been, Leone said.
	   ``There are just so many different nerve connections that have
to heal,'' he said.
	   Sang will have to stay at the hospital for at least a week under
observation. Her parents, who arrived Saturday from China, have not
decided whether to move her to another hospital or return home.
	   Sang begins rehabilitation Monday.
	   Physicians and others who have visited Sang said that she was in
high spirits Sunday.
	   ``This young lady did not stop talking,'' said Nassau County
Executive Thomas S. Gulotta. ``Her spirit was uplifting, you had to
be encouraged to be in her presence.''
	   Goodwill Games spokesman Michael Lewellen reiterated an earlier
pledge by the event's sponsor, Turner Sports, and its parent
company Time-Warner Inc. to provide all possible resources to
secure the family's future.
	   Lewellen said details had yet to be finalized.
	   ``The family has only been here for a few hours,'' he said.
``They haven't had the opportunity to state their wishes.''

A champion's tears: Joyner-Kersee says farewell
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EDWARDSVILLE, Illinois (AP) _ Jackie Joyner-Kersee could hold it
back for only so long.
	   She made it through the final long jump and through the end of
her last competition.
	   Then the tears fell _ just like the many records whenever she
competed during a remarkable 18-year career.
	   The world's greatest female athlete had finally stopped running
and jumping.
	   At a meet billed as ``Track and Field's Farewell to Jackie
Joyner-Kersee,'' she took one last victory lap Saturday night,
carrying an Olympic torch and accompanied by a group of youngsters
from her hometown just 20 miles (30 kilometers) away.
	   ``I didn't want it to end,'' she said, her voice choking. ``But
I told myself, `Jackie, you can't go on forever.' I knew the day
would come. I hate that I have to leave. I have no regrets.
	   ``To me, it was special that it ended like this. It made me feel
I've been blessed,'' she said. ``I'm happy also because a lot of my
friends and family were here to see me compete.''
	   A crowd of 9,100 nearly filled 10,000-seat Ralph Korte Stadium
at Southern Illinois-Edwardsville for the U.S. Open, including
about 3,000 youngsters from poverty-stricken East St. Louis, where
Joyner-Kersee was born
	   Appropriately, she wore uniform No. 1.
	   There was no Hollywood-style ending, however. She finished sixth
in the long jump, but none of her fans seemed disappointed.
	   ``It's almost like an extended family,'' said the 36-year-old
Joyner-Kersee. ``It's always a lift when people are willing to give
it their time. Even as I was struggling, I felt they didn't care
what the (result) was.
	   ``The kids were yelling, `We love you, Jackie.' That's
something. They don't even know who I am.''
	   They knew.
	   To many, Joyner-Kersee is their hero, a role model.
	   She is building the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Youth Foundation, a
facility to provide hope and a haven to 14,000 youngsters in East
St. Louis and surrounding communities.
	   ``I want to give back to my hometown ... the kinds of
opportunities afforded me as a youngster,'' she said.
	   As the meet began and Joyner-Kersee appeared on the field to
warm up, she waved to the crowd and the fans responded with
banners, signs and placards. One read, ``Thanks For the Memories.''
Another said, ``JJK _ We Love You.''
	   The warmth and affection enveloped the stadium.
	   Tamekia Howard of St. Louis, a 400- and 800-meter runner at
Lincoln University, recalled meeting Joyner-Kersee at a high school
meet.
	   ``She was very inspiring,'' the 19-year-old said. ``She told us
to work hard, never give up, always strive for the best, and never
let anything stop you in what you want to do.''
	   Eileen O'Brien, 53, of St. Louis, was another spectator who
wanted to be part of the historic event.
	   ``I admire her because of all the work she's done in the
community,'' O'Brien said. ``She's the greatest athlete in the
world. I wanted to see her last meet. I wanted to support her.
	   ``She's wonderful ... down to earth. She has no airs about
her.''
	   After the meet she received the key to the city by East St.
Louis Mayor Gordon Bush. She jogged her triumphant lap with the
torch and surrounded by the Tigerettes track team from her high
school, Lincoln High.
	   The song ``When I think of Home'' from ``The Wiz'' played, and
the fans went home satisfied.
	   ``I just wanted to walk away knowing I did my best,''
Joyner-Kersee said. ``I've done this for so many years. I know I've
done my best.''
	   Joyner-Kersee's best often was better than anybody else's.
	   She won six Olympic medals, including golds in the heptathlon in
1988 and 1992 and the long jump in 1988. She won four world
championship medals _ all gold _ in the heptathlon in 1987 and 1993
and in the long jump in 1987 and 1991.
	   She set the world record in the heptathlon four times between
1986 and 1988 and still owns the record with 7,291 points in the
Seoul Olympics. She set the world record in the long jump in 1987
and still has the American record of 24-7, set twice in 1994.
	   She tied the American record in the 100-meter hurdles in 1988,
and set the world indoor record in the 55-meter hurdles twice in
1989. She has the six highest heptathlon scores in history and is
one of only two multi-event athletes to surpass 7,000 points.
	   Joyner-Kersee completed her spectacular heptathlon career
Wednesday night, winning her fourth consecutive Goodwill Games gold
medal with 6,502 points, the highest score in the world this year.
	   But those numbers don't tell the whole story of Joyner-Kersee.
	   There's her devotion to her struggling hometown. There's her
generosity with her time and money. And there's respect from her
peers.
	   ``Now that she is leaving, people will start to realize what she
has meant to the sport,'' hurdler Reggie Torian said.

	   SALZBURG, Austria (AP) _ Barbara Schett beat Aleksandra Olsza
4-6, 6-0, 6-3 Sunday in a rain-delayed match, rested for one hour
and then finished off Magdalena Feistel-Mroz 6-0, 6-2 to lead
Austria to a 5-0 win over Poland and a place in World Group II.
	   Rain postponed the Schett-Olsza match Saturday. On Sunday, the
Austrian took only 30 minutes to score the victory.
	   After an hour's rest, she beat Feistel-Mroz, who substituted for
Poland's No. 1 Magdalena Grzybowska, who injured her knee Saturday
in a 6-2, 3-6, 6-0 loss to Austrian Slyvia Plischkes.
	   In doubles, Plischke and Schett defeated Katarina Teodorowicz
and Feistel-Mroz, 6-4, 6-0.
	   ``We reached our goal,'' said Austria's Fed Cup director, Judith
Wiesner.

Chinese gymnast unlikely to walk again, physician says

	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ A Chinese gymnast paralyzed in a
fall during the Goodwill Games was able to sit up Sunday, but
doctors said she would probably never walk again, despite
successful surgery to rebuild her spine.
	   Since her 7-hour spinal operation Saturday, Sang Lan has
regained some strength in her shoulders and biceps, said Dr.
Vincent Leone, director of spinal surgery at Nassau County Medical
Center in Long Island. But there has been no improvement in
mobility in her hands, wrists and legs.
	   But the operation, which stabilized her spine, did allow Sang,
17, to sit up in bed, something that was impossible before the
surgery, Leone told a news conference.
	   Given the complexity of the injury and the healing process, it
was too soon to say how quickly the gymnast would recover and what
her final prognosis will be, Leone told reporters, adding it was
unlikely she would ever walk again.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, struck the mat
with her head Tuesday after missing a simple vault during practice.
	   The goal of Saturday's surgery was to stabilize Sang's spine by
screwing three titanium plates into the section of the neck injured
in the fall. Surgeons also removed broken bone fragments and used
bits of bone from her left hip to fuse together vertebrae.
	   ``The implants basically prevent her head from falling off her
shoulders,'' Leone said.
	   Sang is also being treated with an experimental nerve drug that
doctors said was her only hope of walking again. But it was too
early to say if the drug, which provides the building blocks for
nerves to repair themselves, was working, Leone said.
	   ``There are just so many different nerve connections that have
to heal,'' he said.
	   Sang's parents _ who arrived from China just hours after the
surgery _ were driven from Kennedy Airport to the hospital and did
not speak to reporters. They plan to give a news conference in the
next several days, hospital spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg said.
	   Sang will have to stay at the hospital for at least a week under
observation, and her parents have not decided whether to continue
treatment for their only child here or move her back home.
	   Before her parents left China, Sang's saddened friends made
1,000 paper birds for the couple to take with them _ symbols of
their wishes for a quick recovery.
	   Sang's parent's rarely saw their child, who was chosen for
national team training when she was 11. Since then, her parents
have seen her only three times, most recently in October, as their
only daughter trained 740 miles (1,190 kilometers) from home in
Beijing.
	   Physicians and others who visited Sang on Sunday said that she
was in high spirits.
	   ``This young lady did not stop talking,'' said Nassau County
Executive Thomas S. Gulotta. ``Her spirit was uplifting, you had to
be encouraged to be in her presence.''
	   Gulotta said Sang asked to watch the Goodwill Games on Sunday
night and the hospital would arrange a special TV feed for her.
	   Goodwill Games spokesman Michael Lewellen reiterated an earlier
pledge by the event's sponsor, Turner Sports, and its parent
company, Time-Warner Inc., to provide all possible resources to
secure the family's future.
	   Lewellen said details had yet to be finalized.
	   ``The family has only been here for a few hours,'' he said.
``They haven't had the opportunity to state their wishes.''

Former US hostage in Tehran to meet Iranian hostage-taker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A former American U.S. hostage will meet a
leader of the Iranian students who seized the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran at a forum in Paris, the organizers said Sunday.
	   The meeting is scheduled to take place at the UNESCO
headquarters on Friday, said the hosts, the Centre for World
Dialogue.
	   The pro-government newspaper Iran News reported Sunday that the
encounter will be between Barry Rosen, who was a press relations
officer at the U.S. Embassy, and Abbas Abdi, who helped organize
the take-over of the embassy in November 1979.
	   It will be the first time that Rosen and Abdi meet and they will
address the forum, which will be chaired by the former French
ambassador and Middle East correspondent for Le Monde newspaper,
Eric Rouleau.
	   Rosen and Abdi will recall their experiences and give their
views of future relations between Iran and the United States, said
a statement from the Centre for World Dialogue, a private
foundation based in Nicosia, Cyprus.
	   Rosen, who was held with 51 other Americans in the embassy for
444 days, is now a public affairs officer at Columbia University,
New York. He could not be reached for comment Sunday, but was
quoted earlier this year as supporting moves to end the hostility
between Tehran and Washington.
	   ``The mistrust is very strong. But somebody has to make the
first move,'' he said.
	   Abdi is a senior editor at Salaam, an Iranian newspaper that
used to adopt a hard-line stance, but which is today among the most
moderate publications in Iran. He too could not be contacted
Sunday.

Martinez beats Raymond as Spain ties U.S. in Fed Cup semifinals

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Martinez win over Raymond &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain and the United States battled to a
2-2 draw Sunday in the Fed Cup semifinals, setting up a doubles
tiebreaker under the lights.
	   In the first match of the day, Monica Seles crushed Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario 6-4, 6-0 to give the United States a 2-1 lead.
Saturday's play had ended in a 1-1 draw.
	   But Conchita Martinez, ranked seventh in the world, averted her
team's defeat Sunday by downing Lisa Raymond 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 before
a boisterous home crowd waving red and yellow Spanish flags.
	   The doubles were due to pit the same two Spaniards against
Raymond and Mary Joe Fernandez.
	   The winning team faces either France or Switzerland in the Fed
Cup finals September 19-20.
	   Seles, ranked fifth in the world, dominated her first rematch
with No. 4 Sanchez Vicario since the latter beat her to take the
French Open last month. Sunday's match lasted just 62 minutes.
	   Sanchez Vicario showed her trademark skill in chasing down just
about everything, but had trouble holding service. After holding
serve to go 2-2 in the first set she did not manage to do so again
for the rest of the match.
	   Seles insisted there no revenge element to her victory.
	   ``I took it as an individual match,'' she said. ``I tried to do
some things differently from Roland Garros.''
	   In the other singles match, Raymond was serving for the first
set at 5-4 but failed to hold service. It went to a tiebreaker in
which she was swamped 7-1. In the second set, down 2-4, she fought
back to 4-4. But in the last two games she failed to win a single
point.
	   Neither player wanted to speak to reporters following the match.
	   On Saturday, Raymond started off strong in her singles match
against Sanchez Vicario, taking the first set 7-6 (7-4) and moving
to 2-0 in the second set. But the Spaniard came roaring back to
take that set and the third, 6-3 and 6-0.
	   In the other singles match Saturday, Seles downed Martinez 6-3,
3-6, 6-1.
	   Spain is a powerhouse in Fed Cup play, winning the title four
times between 1991 and 1995.
	   But it is seeking revenge for the 5-0 drubbing it suffered at
the hands of the United States the last time the two countries
played, in the 1996 finals in Atlantic City.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Colombia may form a ``group of
friends'' of Latin American and European countries to help peace
talks between the government and rebels, president-elect Andres
Pastrana said Sunday.
	   The group might include Venezuela, Mexico, Costa Rica, Spain and
Germany, aides to Pastrana said.
	   Pastrana, who was making a brief visit to Venezuela to meet
President Rafael Caldera, also said he was optimistic the talks
will end Colombia's 34-year civil war but he cautioned they may be
drawn out.
	   ``There is a lot of will on the part of the rebels'' to achieve
peace, he told reporters. But ``peace is a long process.''
	   He said leaders of paramilitary groups sent him a letter last
week stating their interest in participating in peace talks. Human
rights organizations say the groups are linked to Colombia's
military, drug traffickers and large landowners.
	   Leaders of Colombia's rebel groups have already met for
preliminary peace talks in Germany and with Pastrana in Colombia's
jungles.
	   Pastrana is to travel to Washington, D.C., this week to meet
with President Clinton and other officials. He takes office Aug. 7.

	   CAPE ELIZABETH, Maine (AP) _ It's a race she has dreamed of for
more than a decade, and Joan Benoit Samuelson won't even be running
in it.
	   The inaugural Beach to Beacon 10-kilometer race Saturday brings
some of the world's top distance runners to this scenic Portland
suburb where Samuelson grew up and launched a career that
culminated in a gold medal in the first women's Olympic marathon.
	   ``I can't tell you how many thousands of miles I've logged on
Shore Road and on (Route) 77. These world-class athletes and
recreational athletes will be retracing the steps that I've run
many, many times,'' she said at her seaside home in Freeport, a
half hour's drive up the coast of Maine, the northeastern-most
state.
	   Organizers capped the field at 3,000 for the race that begins
near Crescent Beach State Park and offers intermittent ocean views
en route to the finish line at Portland Head Light, the first
lighthouse commissioned by George Washington in 1790.
	   ``It's a fast race course,'' she said. ``It has the potential, I
think, for a world's best time to be established.''
	   Top male runners in the field include Joseph Kimani of Kenya,
who holds the world mark of 27:20 in a 10-K road race; two-time New
York Marathon winner German Silva of Mexico; Keith Brantly, the top
U.S. finisher in the 1996 Olympic marathon, and fellow American
Mark Coogan.
	   The women's competition features Kenyans Helen Kimaiyo-Kipkosei,
Gladys Ondeyo and Catherine Ndereba, along with Americans Libbie
Hickman and Kim Jones.
	   Interest generated by the race is seen first and foremost as a
tribute to Samuelson.
	   ``It's primarily because of the person behind the event, and
that's Joan,'' said Dave McGillivray, technical director of the
Boston Marathon and director of the Beach to Beacon. ``It certainly
is a testament to the respect that the running community has for
her as one of the all-time great ambassadors for long-distance
running.''
	   The route runs near some of the benchmarks of Samuelson's
career: the high school where she steered her athletic talent
toward track and cross-country after a skiing injury at age 15; the
bronze statue outside the town library that pays tribute to her
Olympic triumph; and her childhood home, not far from the finish
line.
	   Samuelson said thoughts of a hometown race began to percolate
more than 10 years ago, but the project moved forward only after
she lined up a sponsor, Peoples Heritage Bank. Samuelson has
appeared in the Portland-based bank's TV ads and its chairman is a
runner.
	   Everything else _ additional sponsorships, volunteers and
support from the town _ quickly fell into place.
	   At 41, Samuelson spends much of her time with her husband and
their two children, but still races several times a year. Although
she, like Jones, now qualifies for the masters category, she still
pits herself against the open field and the clock.
	   Samuelson is best known for her Olympic triumph in Los Angeles
in 1984. She is also a two-time winner of the Boston Marathon and
holds the U.S. women's marathon record of 2:21:21, set at Chicago
in 1985.
	   Maine has always attracted hordes of summer visitors, and
Samuelson expects the Beach to Beacon to generate a lot of buzz in
the running community and become a premier event on the summer
calendar. It offers dlrs 50,000 in prize money.
	   ``It won't be the East Coast version of the Bay to Breakers,''
the similar-sounding 12-K race that draws tens of thousands of
runners into the streets of San Francisco, she said.
	   ``But it's going to grow. Providing the sun shines and people
see the beauty of this course, this is going to turn into another
Falmouth Road Race,'' she predicted, referring to the popular
7.1-mile (11.4-kilometer) event on Massachusetts' Cape Cod that she
has won several times.
	   But instead of being in the lead pack Saturday morning,
Samuelson will be the guiding spirit of the race, showcasing it in
color commentary interviews on television
	   From the way Samuelson describes it, her day may turn out to be
more exhausting than if she were racing.
	   ``I'll be tending to a myriad of tasks on race day,'' she said.
``I'll probably run between the finish line and the starting line a
gazillion times.''

Graf trying to regain confidence before U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STANFORD, California (AP) _ Steffi Graf's knee is stronger and
she's getting back into shape. But Graf, who plays in the Bank of
the West tournament that starts Monday, still needs to regain the
confidence of a champion.
	   Graf, who has won 21 Grand Slam tournament singles titles and
held the No. 1 ranking for an unprecedented 377 weeks, is
attempting a comeback that began after reconstructive left knee
surgery last year.
	   She resumed playing competitively in the weeks leading up to
Wimbledon last month, and the knee has felt fine. And, despite
battling sinus problems at Wimbledon, she is starting to get back
into shape.
	   Now, the main objective is to play as many matches as possible
before the U.S. Open _ which she has won five times.
	   ``I think it's very important for me to play tournaments to get
match tough,'' she said. ``I think physically I'm starting to feel
real good about it. It's just knowing which points to play at
certain times and regaining the confidence to play tournaments.''
	   Though she's ranked just 57th in the world, Graf is seeded
fourth in the dlrs 450,000 Bank of the West tournament. The top
three seeds are Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles and Venus Williams.
	   All four top seeds have first-round byes and are not expected to
play until Wednesday night at the earliest.
	   Graf has had a difficult recovery from the knee surgery. Her
comeback has been stalled by other injuries and she became
frustrated at having to drop out of tournaments. Earlier this year,
she considered retiring.
	   Those thoughts have disappeared for now, though the 29-year-old
Graf acknowledges she's not completely sure what to expect from
herself during the next few weeks.
	   ``Right now I am entering a sort of a gray area where it's
difficult to know how well I'm going to be doing,'' she said. ``It
seems like I need another two to three tournaments and then I'll
feel comfortable and play the matches I want to and have the
confidence I need.''
	   Graf, who won an exhibition tournament in New Jersey last
weekend, plans to play tournaments in San Diego and Montreal in the
weeks following the Bank of the West event.
	   Graf is three short of Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam
singles titles, but said that mark never enters her mind.
Especially now, when just getting back into top form is her main
concern.
	   ``I don't really have too many goals left,'' she said. ``I've
pretty much done it all. I've got my place in history, so there
really is nothing much left.''

Sudan puts four dissidents on trial for subversion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Four supporters of a deposed prime
minister went on trial for subversion here Sunday amid a rowdy
crowd and tight security.
	   Dozens of men shouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, as the
dissidents appeared in a court in Omdurman, the twin city of the
capital, Khartoum.
	   The crowd quieted down only when a defense lawyer appealed to
them for calm. Police ringed the courthouse and lined the streets
nearby.
	   The four men were charged with subversion, disseminating false
information and disturbing public order. The state alleges they
wrote and delivered a sermon in Wad Nubawi mosque, Omdurman, early
this month that accused the government of slandering their
political group, al-Ansar, which supports former Prime Minister
Sadiq al-Mahdi.
	   The sermon allegedly attacked the government for claiming that
al-Ansar was involved in the planting of a series of bombs, which
were set to explode at government installations on June 30 during
celebrations of the military coup which overthrew al-Mahdi in 1989.
	   The government says the plan was foiled after some bombs
exploded prematurely without causing injuries.
	   After defense counsel asked for more time to prepare their case,
the judge adjourned the trial to Aug. 2.

Archeologists uncover 17th-century British settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FERRYLAND, Newfoundland (AP) _ The remains of a colonial British
settlement on Newfoundland's southern shore have drawn a variety of
scientists to one of the largest and richest 17th-century sites in
British North America.
	   One million artifacts have been uncovered and restored at an
on-site laboratory _ everything from rare Portuguese pottery and
gold-plated beads to fish hooks and tobacco pipes.
	   ``It's not King Tut's tomb, but in terms of colonial sites it's
quite spectacular,'' said archeologist Jim Tuck who heads up a team
in their seventh year of an extensive project to unearth what was
once Lord Baltimore's Colony of Avalon.
	   Besides archaeologists, fish biologists have come to study fish
bones found in the latrine, excrement has been examined for clues
about stomach parasites, and Atomic Energy of Canada wants to know
how well copper is preserved underground.
	   The colony, founded in 1621, was one of several settlements
backed by English investors. Others were located in Virginia, New
England and Bermuda.
	   The dig site is about 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres) of land at the
edge of town.
	   So far, the team has revealed a portion of the stone
harborfront, a warehouse and latrine, a blacksmith's hearth, parts
of a large upper-class home and portions of the cobblestone street
that ran through the village.
	   ``This is a much more complete picture of the life of people
who, for the most part, were illiterate,'' Tuck said. ``It's more
than just the stuff that comes from documents, which is always
biased because only a few people could write.''
	   Funding for the project runs out at the end of this season. More
than Canadian dlrs 1 million (U.S. dlrs 666.000) has been spent
since 1992 under a federal-provincial agreement.
	   Tuck has applied for more grant money.
	   Ferryland, a struggling fishing community of 700, has seen
significant economic spinoffs from the dig. More than 11,000
visitors toured the site last year, compared with 2,000 in 1992.

Miner reported alive nine days after Austrian mine accident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A miner feared dead after a massive
landslide buried him and 10 others nine days ago in a talc mine is
alive and has made voice contact with rescuers, the Austrian Press
Agency reported Sunday.
	   There was no word on the 10 others.
	   But APA quoted a doctor at the scene, Fritz Sartory, as saying
the miner, Georg Hainzl, had spoken with rescuers by microphone
lowered into an emergency shaft.
	   ``I'm alright,'' the doctor quoted Hainzl as saying. ``Only my
feet are cold.''
	   APA said rescuers were hoping to bring Hainzl to the surface
later Sunday night.
	   Hainzl was working in the mine in the town of Lassing, 200
kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna, when a mudslide brought
on by heavy rains trapped him July 17.
	   A 10-member team was sent to rescue him. But as the team was
riding on an elevator to the bottom of the 60-meter (200-foot)
shaft, a second, massive mudslide snapped the cable, plunging them
to the bottom of the shaft.
	   The mudslides left a crater 50 meters (165 feet) deep and about
150 meters (500 feet) in diameter. Several houses tumbled into the
pit.

Former Colombian Congresswoman Shot Dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)_ A former congresswoman and mayor from the
ruling Liberal Party was shot to death in her home Sunday morning,
police said.
	   Betty Camacho was inside her residence in the city of
Villavicencio, about 47 miles (75 km) southeast of Bogota, when she
was murdered by a gunman who fled on foot, police said.
	   One of Camacho's two children was also home, but did not witness
her mother's shooting, police added.
	   Police said they did not know the motive or the victim's age.
	   A former judge and mayor of Villavicencio, Camacho served 12
years in Colombia's House of Representatives and Senate before
stepping down in July after losing a reelection bid.
	   She was one of 110 legislators currently under investigation by
the Supreme Court for possible crimes in voting in 1996 to clear
President Ernesto Samper of wrongdoing in a dlrs 6 million
presidential campaign contribution from drug traffickers.

Italy's La Scala opera house performs in Beirut to celebrate peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The prestigious La Scala opera company of
Italy staged a one-night performance here Sunday to celebrate the
restoration of peace to Lebanon.
	   The 180 musicians and singers of the Milan-based La Scala
arrived in Lebanon only a few hours before they were due to perform
at the Forum de Beyrouth, a hall in the Karantina district that
witnessed some of the most savage fighting of the 1975-90 civil
war.
	   Italian Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni flew in especially
for the event, which was attended by President Elias Hrawi and a
packed audience of 6,000. The show was broadcast live on
television.
	   Conductor Riccardo Muti staged an entirely Italian program of
extracts from the operas of Bellini, Rossini, Verdi and Puccini.
	   Muti told reporters before the show that he had ``realized a
dream'' by performing in Lebanon after peace had returned to the
country. La Scala liked to perform in countries that were
recovering from war, as it had done in Sarajevo, the Bosnian
capital, last year.
	   The performance was subsidized by the Italian government and the
Ravenna Festival foundation. Ticket prices ranged between dlrs 25
and dlrs 100.
	   Since the end of the war, Lebanon has hosted a number of
international performers, such as Jose Carreras, Julio Iglesias,
Paul Anka, Shirley Bassey and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovitch.

Statehood referendum a huge gamble for Puerto Rico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAN PERRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ In calling a referendum on Puerto
Rican statehood, Gov. Pedro Rossello has taken a huge gamble that
might invigorate the statehood drive he champions _ but could
ultimately cripple it.
	   The plan dominated newspapers, radio and street talk Sunday, the
diversity of opinion underscoring the deep divisions on the issue.
	   But many on all sides of the debate questioned the wisdom of
holding another referendum _ the second in five years _ before
securing a promise from the U.S. Congress to respect the outcome.
	   ``It should be done with the support of Congress, not as the
governor wants,'' said Ruth Rosado, 53.
	   The House of Representatives breathed new life into the
statehood movement in March, voting 209 to 208 to give Puerto
Ricans the right to choose statehood, independence or the current
commonwealth status in a vote the United States would be bound to
honor.
	   But the bill is being held up in the Senate. Majority leader
Trent Lott has said there is not enough time to complete
legislation in 1998, but many here attribute the holdup to
Republican fears that as a state Puerto Rico would send mainly
Democrats to Washington.
	   Even if the Senate approves the bill and Puerto Ricans choose
statehood, the final decision rests with Congress.
	   A determined Rossello announced his decision to hold a
referendum in December, regardless of what the Senate does, to
thousands of cheering supporters at a rally Saturday marking the
centennial of the U.S. invasion of the Caribbean island.
	   The governor apparently believes a vigorous campaign will
energize what has become a somewhat tedious debate, and open minds
and hearts to his arguments _ that Congress could revoke the
commonwealth status at any time, for example, and statehood is the
only guarantee of citizenship.
	   But another defeat would likely freeze the statehood drive for
years, and be a bitter personal humiliation for the ambitious
leader.
	   Rossello also evidently hopes that a convincing victory could
sweep aside fears that the Spanish-speaking island might become the
U.S. equivalent of Quebec, the restive French-speaking Canadian
province.
	   Jeffrey Farrow, a leader of the White House Working Group on
Puerto Rico, was quoted Sunday in the San Juan Star as saying U.S.
President Bill Clinton would ask Congress to honor the referendum
result if statehood won.
	   But it's a roll of the dice, for statehood does not appear to
enjoy the majority it needs.
	   ``The only thing a plebiscite will do is to confirm what
everybody knows, which is that Puerto Ricans are divided,'' said
political commentator Alex Maldonado. ``To move Congress you need
consensus ... Getting 2 or 3 points more than commonwealth is not
going to prove anything.''
	   In a nonbinding 1993 referendum, voters decided 49 percent to 46
percent to remain a commonwealth, with 5 percent choosing
independence.
	   Rossello's New Progressive Party has tried to use the centennial
as a lever to advance statehood, but surveys suggest the deadlock
persists.
	   A San Juan Star poll two months ago showed statehood backed by
41 percent, commonwealth by 40 percent and independence by 8
percent. The poll's margin of error was 3 percentage points.
	   Anibal Acavedo Vila, head of the pro-commonwealth Popular
Democratic Party, said he was confident of another victory.
	   The statehood movement's largest hurdle is that Puerto Ricans
overwhelmingly consider themselves a distinct nation, and many of
them see the present arrangement as the best of all worlds.
	   Puerto Rico's residents are U.S. citizens, but they cannot vote
for president unless they live on the mainland and their sole
representative in Congress does not have a vote.
	   They do enjoy the benefits of being part of the United States:
their dlrs 8,000 annual per capita income, while low for the
mainland, is far more than most Latin American countries.
	   And they retain a sense of sovereignty: their own Olympic team
and a cherished flag.
	   ``We have freedoms, we are comfortable (economically),'' said
Angel Hernandez Cruz, 55. ``So with all (commonwealth's) defects,
it's a good thing.''
	   But for every person who believes that, another feels like
42-year-old Modesto Figueroa: ``Being part of the U.S. is being
part of the greatest nation in the world, but our present status is
not enough for me.''

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A Turkish Airlines plane carrying a top
soccer team returning from training made an emergency landing at
Ankara airport on Sunday after the captain detected a fault in its
landing gear, the transport minister said.
	   The plane, a Boeing 727 on its way to Trabzon from Istanbul,
circled the airport in Istanbul several times before being diverted
to Ankara, which has better facilities for emergency landings,
Minister Necdet Menzir told the semi-official Anatolia news agency.
	   The plane landed safely in Ankara, some 750 kilometers (450
miles) southwest of Istanbul.
	   All 188 passengers and crew, including members of the Black Sea
soccer team, Trabzonspor, returning from training in Germany, were
evacuated safely.
	   Last week, another Turkish Airlines plane bound for Dusseldorf,
Germany, was forced to return to Istanbul airport shortly after
takeoff because of an engine failure. No one was hurt.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A Turkish Airlines plane carrying a top
soccer team returning from training made an emergency landing at
Ankara airport on Sunday after the captain detected a fault in its
landing gear, the transport minister said.
	   The plane, a Boeing 727 on its way to Trabzon from Istanbul,
circled the airport in Trabzon several times before being diverted
to Ankara, which has better facilities for emergency landings,
Minister Necdet Menzir told the semi-official Anatolia news agency.
	   The plane landed safely in Ankara, some 750 kilometers (450
miles) southwest of Trabzon.
	   All 188 passengers and crew, including members of the Black Sea
soccer team, Trabzonspor, returning from training in Germany, were
evacuated safely.
	   Last week, another Turkish Airlines plane bound for Dusseldorf,
Germany, was forced to return to Istanbul airport shortly after
takeoff because of an engine failure. No one was hurt.

Sudan tries four dissidents for subversion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Four supporters of a deposed prime
minister went on trial for subversion in Sudan on Sunday amid a
rowdy crowd and tight security.
	   Dozens of men shouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God is great, as the
dissidents appeared in a court in Omdurman, the twin city of the
capital, Khartoum.
	   The crowd quieted down only when a defense lawyer appealed for
calm. Police ringed the courthouse and lined the streets nearby.
	   The four men were charged with subversion, disseminating false
information and disturbing public order. They are accused of
writing and delivered a sermon in Wad Nubawi mosque, Omdurman,
early this month that accused the government of slandering their
political group, al-Ansar, which supports former Prime Minister
Sadiq al-Mahdi.
	   The sermon allegedly attacked the government for claiming that
al-Ansar was involved in planting bombs in government installations
on June 30 during celebrations of the military coup which overthrew
al-Mahdi in 1989.
	   The government says the plan was foiled after some bombs
exploded prematurely without causing injuries.
	   After defense counsel asked for more time to prepare their case,
the judge adjourned the trial to Aug. 2.

Suspected would-be immigrants drown trying to enter Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The bodies of five suspected would-be
immigrants were found in waters off southern Spain and seven others
were rescued alive after their boat overturned, news reports said
Sunday.
	   The survivors were found some five kilometers (three miles) off
the southwestern coast close to the town of Tarifa, the private
Europa Press news agency said, citing the Marine Rescue Service.
	   It was not known how many people had been traveling in the
single-engine boat and authorities feared the number of dead could
rise.
	   The identities of the seven rescued and the five killed was not
immediately available.
	   Driven by poverty at home and hopes of a better life in Europe,
dozens of North African men, mostly from Morocco, attempt to cross
the Mediterranean Sea each year and enter Spain clandestinely.
	   The most common means of transport are rudimentry boats and many
sink along the way.
	   On Sunday, people aboard a yacht alerted police after they
picked up four of the survivors. Another yacht rescued a fifth
while the Marine Rescue Service picked up the bodies and two more
survivors.

Brazilians win beach volleyball gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with quotes, other results. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ On a pile of sand dumped on an ice-skating rink
surrounded by skyscrapers, a pair of Brazilians showed why they are
the world's top-ranked beach volleyball team and kept the sport's
senior dude from adding another victory to his record list.
	   Guilherme Marques and Para Ferreira beat the U.S. team of Karch
Kiraly and Adam Johnson 12-11, 12-4 Sunday to win the gold medal at
the Goodwill Games.
	   With almost 1 million pounds (460,000 kilos) of sand imported
from Canada to cover Wollman Rink in Central Park, a sport that's
used to endless horizons of the seashore was played with huge shade
trees nearby and the office buildings, hotels and apartment towers
of midtown Manhattan looming above.
	   A near-capacity crowd of 2,800 was charged up early, hoping to
see the 37-year-old Kiraly, who is often mentioned as his sport's
Babe Ruth, Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan, add another title to
the 130 he has won over his 12-year career.
	   It started well for the U.S. team, but the Brazilians, the
defending world champions, took control late in the first game and
dominated the second to sweep the best-of-3 match for the gold
medal.
	   The Brazilians, who shared dlrs 30,000 as champions, definitely
had age on their side, with the 29-year-old Guilherme five years
older than Para, who is considered the best player in the world
right now. Johnson, 33, and Kiraly, partners on the U.S.
professional circuit, split dlrs 20,000 for winning the silver.
	   The U.S. team had a 9-6 lead in the opening game, but the
Brazilians ran off five straight points to set up a game point.
Kiraly and Johnson managed to tie it 11-11 with Kiraly making a
great diving save on one point and coming up with a great stuff at
the net for the other.
	   The Brazilians got the serve back on the next play, then put the
opening game away with an immediate point.
	   Guilherme and Para _ just like Brazil's soccer players, they
usually go by one name only _ took command of the second game with
a 6-point run for an 8-1 lead. The second game was much closer to
the early round meeting that Brazil won 15-3, Kiraly and Johnson's
only loss before the gold medal match.
	   The air temperature was 81 degrees (27.22 Celsius) and a
thermometer in the sand registered 102 degrees (38.89 Celsius),
well off the 125 (51.67 Celsius) that was recorded earlier in the
week.
	   In the match for the bronze medal, Martin Conde and Eduardo
Martinez of Argentina beat Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner of
Australia 12-11, 12-9.

Congress makes minor game changes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Basketballs' international governing body
Sunday made some minor game changes, but did not take any steps to
bring it closer to NBA standards.
	   A two-day meeting by the World Congress of FIBA, the
International Basketball Federation, decided that the game will be
stopped after a field goal during the last two minutes of a match
and during extra periods. No substitutions or time out requests
will be allowed during this dead ball period.
	   Another change was the increase of time-outs from two to three
in the second half of a game, for a total of five in the two
20-minute periods.
	   The congress, however, did not discuss whether to increase the
distance of the three-point shot from 6.25 meters (20 feet 6
inches) to 6.75 meters (22 feet 2 inches), as in the NBA nor to
reduce the time of an attack from 30 to 24 seconds.
	   According to FIBA spokesman Florian Wanninger, the congress did
not discuss such amendments because the central board failed to
approve them in its meeting prior to the Athens congress. But
following a change decided at the congress, the central board is
from now on entitled to make amendments to the official basketball
rules at its biannual meetings whenever it is considered necessary.
	   National federations are obliged to put the new changes into
effect any time prior to the World Juniors Championships, to take
place in Portugal in June 1999.
	   The congress also elected Abdoulaye Seye Moreau of Senegal as
its president for the next four years. He will replace George
Killian of the United States.
	   The meeting took place two days before the opening of the final
rounds of the World Basketball Championships with the participation
of 16 teams divided in four groups.
	   Interest in the 10-day tournament has dropped because an NBA
lockout prevented a United States dream team from participating.
	   USA Basketball, the sport's national governing body, replaced
the 12 NBA players initially selected for the championships with a
team of CBA players and Americans currently playing in European
clubs.
	   The American team plays its first game Wednesday against Brazil.
Other teams in Group C are Korea and Lithuania.

Croatia qualifies For Group 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOL, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia qualified Sunday for the first time
for the Federation Cup World Group 1, defeating the last year's
finalist, the Netherlands, 3-2.
	   Croat Iva Majoli defeated Miriam Oremans, 6-2, 6-2, while
Silvija Talaja upset Amanda Hopmans, 6-2, 6-3.
	   Surprisingly enough, the victory came not thanks to the world's
No. 20 Majoli _ who was crushed 6-1, 6-0 on Saturday by Amanda
Hopmans _ but due to the 20-year-old Talaja, 145th on the WTA, who
only joined the team after Mirjana Lucic did not appear in Bol.
	   She won her both single matches.
	   Majoli however recovered on Sunday. She played patiently and
wisely, hitting the ball for Oremans's backhands, her weaker shot.
Majoli easily won.
	   Talaja, had no troubles with Hopmans, WTA's 168, in the first
set. In the second, she led 2-0, but Hopmans tied to 2-2. Still,
after 3-3, Talaja won three consecutive games and ousted Hopmans.
	   Playing in the doubles, Talaja and Jelena Kostanic lost to Manon
Bollegraf and Caroline Vis, 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (1-7).
	   Mirjana Lucic, Croat 16-year-old star, did not appear at the
tour due to unspecified health problems.

	   BROOKLYN, Michigan (AP) _ Three spectators were killed and six
others injured Sunday when a tire and suspension pieces flew into
the grandstand during a crash at the U.S. 500.
	   All of the dead and injured were adults, the track said,
although none was identified immediately.
	   Dr. Gregory Baumann, the chief medical director at Michigan
Speedway, said two people died instantly from the impact of the
debris.
	   He added that a third person was taken to one of the track's
medical units, where resuscitation efforts failed.
	   Six spectators were taken by helicopter to Foote Hospital in
Jackson.
	   ``Their conditions appeared to be stable at the time they left
here,'' Baumann said. ``They appeared to be primarily blunt force
type of injuries, as you would expect from that kind of debris.''

Controversial and colorful tycoon Roland ``Tiny'' Rowland dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in Graf 17 with Al Fayed comment, adds Rowland born in
internment camp, graf 18. trims
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Controversial and colorful tycoon Roland ``Tiny''
Rowland, who turned an unprofitable company in Rhodesia into a
multi-billion pound (dollar) international conglomerate, has died
at the age of 80.
	   Rowland had been suffering from skin cancer and died at the
London Clinic, The Observer newspaper announced Sunday. Rowland
owned the newspaper for 13 years, until 1992.
	   The former head of Lonrho Plc built a personal fortune estimated
by the British media at 150 million pounds (dlrs 250 million),
owned homes in Britain and Mexico and a yacht in the Mediterranean,
where he was vacationing with his family when he became ill last
week.
	   A spokesman for Lonrho Africa, a separate company that holds
Lonrho's trading interests in much of Africa, said he died Friday.
	   A truly international figure, Rowland was born in India of
German and Dutch stock and made his reputation as an entrepreneur
in Africa after World War II, calling himself a ``revolutionary
capitalist.''
	   He started by buying two farms in Rhodesia, then branched into
mining and in 1963 became chief executive of the money-losing
London and Rhodesian Mining and Land Company.
	   Recognizing independence in the wind, he realized the
continent's newly independent countries would need industrial and
commercial know-how.
	   Over the next 30 years, he turned Lonrho into a conglomerate
with more than 1,000 subsidiaries in over 60 countries _ including
manufacturing, publishing, oil, gas and shipping interests.
	   ``He believed in the massive resources of Africa and believed
that a British company could make a lot of money by associating
itself with it,'' former Observer editor Donald Trelford told Sky
Television News. ``He got to know all the African leaders. He was
on close personal terms. That was how he worked _ and he achieved
it.''
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, who gave Rowland the
country's highest award, the Order of Good Hope, for his
contribution to peace and prosperity, told The Observer that
Rowland was ``a tremendous friend to the whole country.''
	   ``We will remember him as a longstanding friend in the struggle
against apartheid,'' Mandela was quoted as saying.
	   Kenneth Kaunda, former president of Zambia, was quoted as
saying: ``He was a man full of compassion. He had love for fellow
human beings. We worked together to empower Africans economically
since the Seventies. He is a great loss to us.''
	   But Rowland's unconventional style led to prolonged legal and
political battles as well as brilliant business deals _ and he had
enemies.
	   For much of the last 15 years he waged a bitter campaign against
Mohamed Al Fayed, the Egyptian businessman who defeated him in a
takeover battle for the department store chain House of Fraser,
including London landmark Harrods. He claimed the former
Conservative government approved Al Fayed's 1985 takeover of House
of Fraser with too little investigation.
	   Rowland retired in 1995 after being ousted as head of Lonrho in
a power struggle with Dieter Bock, his joint chief executive.
Rowland had initially tapped Bock as a successor, but the two soon
began feuding.
	   Trelford said Rowland had an ``obsession'' with Al Fayed that
distorted his business judgment and led to his ouster from Lonrho.
Some estimates put the cost of Rowland's vendetta against Al Fayed
at 25 million pounds (dlrs 41 million).
	   ``Tiny Rowland and I were business rivals for many years but I
take no joy in his death,'' Al Fayed said Sunday evening. ``I am
sending my condolences to his widow and family.''
	   Roland ``Tiny'' Rowland was born Roland Walter Fuhrhop in
November 1917 in an internment camp in the British colony of India,
where his German father, from a respected merchant family in
Hamburg, had been working for the family business. When World War I
broke out, the family were interned as enemy aliens. Rowland's
mother, Muriel Carton, was English-born of Dutch stock.
	   His nickname ``Tiny'' is believed to have been given by a nanny
as he shot towards his eventual height of 6 feet 2 inches (1.88
meters).
	   After the war, the family returned to Hamburg. In his teens,
Rowland joined the Hitler Youth, but his father became known as an
anti-Nazi and the family moved to England.
	   After finishing his education at an English boarding school,
Rowland worked for an uncle in the shipping business. During a
business trip to Germany, he spent eight weeks in a Gestapo jail
because of his association with two well-known anti-Nazis.
	   In 1939, he changed his surname to that of his uncle _ Rowland _
and was conscripted into the British Army. But, because of his
German background, he was barred from combat in World War II, and
served with the Royal Army Medical Corps.
	   Rowland's father was again interned, this time on the Isle of
Man, in the Irish Sea. Rowland's constant efforts to win his
father's release led to an ultimatum that he stop badgering
authorities about his father. He did not, was discharged from the
army in 1942 and was interned himself on the Isle of Man.
	   His father was held until the end of the war, but Rowland was
released after nine months.
	   After the war, Rowland spent a short time in England, buying and
selling factories, and then made a fresh start in a new continent.
	   He is survived by his wife, Josie, whom he met in Rhodesia _ now
Zimbabwe _ and by a son and three daughters.
	   Family friend Paul Spicer said the funeral would be private.

Congress makes minor game changes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Basketballs' international governing body
Sunday made some minor game changes, but did not take any steps to
bring it closer to the standards of the U.S. National Basketball
Association.
	   A two-day meeting by the World Congress of FIBA, the
International Basketball Federation, decided that the game will be
stopped after a field goal during the last two minutes of a match
and during extra periods.
	   No substitutions or time out requests will be allowed during
this dead ball period.
	   Another change was the increase of time-outs from two to three
in the second half of a game, for a total of five in the two
20-minute periods.
	   The congress did not discuss whether to increase the distance of
the three-point shot from 6.25 meters (20 feet 6 inches) to 6.75
meters (22 feet 2 inches), as in the NBA nor to reduce the time of
an attack from 30 to 24 seconds.
	   According to FIBA spokesman Florian Wanninger, the congress did
not discuss such amendments because the central board failed to
approve them in its meeting prior to the Athens congress.
	   Sunday's congress voted to entitle the central board to make
amendments to the official basketball rules at its biannual
meetings whenever it is considered necessary.
	   National federations are obliged to put the new changes into
effect any time prior to the World Juniors Championships, to take
place in Portugal in June 1999.
	   The congress also elected Abdoulaye Seye Moreau of Senegal as
its president for the next four years. He will replace George
Killian of the United States.
	   The meeting took place two days before the opening of the final
rounds of the World Basketball Championships with the participation
of 16 teams divided in four groups.
	   Interest in the 10-day tournament has dropped because an NBA
lockout prevented a United States dream team from participating.
	   USA Basketball, the sport's national governing body, replaced
the 12 NBA players initially selected for the championships with a
team of CBA players and Americans currently playing in European
clubs.
	   The American team plays its first game Wednesday against Brazil.
Other teams in Group C are Korea and Lithuania.

	   BROOKLYN, Michigan (AP) _ Three spectators were killed and six
others injured Sunday when a tire and suspension pieces flew into
the grandstand during a crash at the U.S. 500.
	   All the dead and injured were adults, the track said, although
none was identified immediately.
	   Dr. Gregory Baumann, the chief medical director at Michigan
Speedway, said two people died instantly from the impact of the
debris. A third person was taken to a track medical unit, where
resuscitation failed.
	   Six spectators were flown by helicopter to Foote Hospital in
nearby Jackson.
	   ``Their conditions appeared to be stable at the time they left
here,'' Baumann said. ``They appeared to be primarily blunt force
type of injuries, as you would expect from that kind of debris.''
	   Mexican driver Adrian Fernandez, the pole winner for the CART
race, was running third at the time of the crash and was left with
bruised knees. His car slid into the wall on lap 175 of the 250-lap
race, run on a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer), high-banked oval.
	   His right front tire and pieces of the suspension broke off,
flying into the crowd in the fourth-turn grandstand.
	   This is the first spectator death at the track since 1969 when
one fan was killed during a Trans-Am race on the road course.
	   The fourth-turn grandstand area where the spectators were hit
was cleared immediately and a medical examiner's investigation was

estimated at about 50,000.

Iranian president praises Tehran mayor, convicted of corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iranian President Mohammad Khatami spoke out
in defense of Tehran's mayor on Sunday, saying the man convicted of
corruption was an excellent manager.
	   The president said he hoped the appeal court would clear
Gholamhossein Karbaschi, who was convicted Thursday of embezzling
public funds and misappropriating government money.
	   ``I hope that with the benefit of the enlightened views of
Islamic law, and the broad mindedness expected of higher judicial
authorities, the appeal court will allow the government to make use
of the services of that hard-working and outstanding manager,''
Khatami said in an Iranian television report monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp. and received in Cairo.
	   Khatami is an old friend of Karbaschi, having appointed the
popular mayor to run his presidential election campaign last year.
	   The month-long trial of Karbaschi was widely viewed as part of a
power struggle between hard-liners in the government and a
reformist camp that Khatami leads.
	   Karbaschi's lawyers have said they will appeal the verdict. The
mayor was sentenced to five years in prison, fined $530,000 and
barred from holding public office for 20 years.
	   ``As the official responsible for the executive branch and the
head of the government, I express my praise for His Excellency
Karbaschi for his services as a competent and serving manager,''
the television quoted Khatami as telling a meeting of the Cabinet.
	   The president also praised the openness of the trial, which was
broadcast live on state-run television and reported extensively in
the newspapers.
	   ``One of the advantages of the trial was that the people were
informed promptly of issues they are sensitive about. No one is
more deserving and qualified than the people for being informed of
the country's affairs,'' Khatami said.
	   Karbaschi won wide respect for his improvements during his eight
years as mayor. He built parks and social centers and reduced
pollution and traffic congestion. But he also made enemies among
the merchant class which resented his taxes and his support for
Khatami, a moderate cleric who believes in relaxing the Islamic
social code, incurred the enmity of hard-liners.

Plants and trees to return to Mexico City's main square
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Trees and plants will return to the Zocalo
plaza, one of Mexico's most important rallying sites, after
residents overwhelmingly backed the measure in a two-day poll,
officials announced Sunday.
	   The huge square at the heart of the capital had been a park from
1866 to 1952, when it was paved over during the administration of
Mayor Ernesto P. Uruchurtu.
	   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' administration wants to beautify the
plaza and a weekend survey at the Zocalo found the proposal backed
3-to-1 by citizens. Temporary lawns, trees and benches were placed
in the plaza to give visitors an idea of how it could appear.
	   Mexico City Environment Secretary Alejandro Encinas said trees
and green areas will be added to the plaza, which sits in front of
the historic Metropolitan Cathedral, this year.
	   ``We will immediately start the bidding process, and the project
could be ready by December,'' he said.
	   The Zocalo has been the site of political ceremonies and
protests, as well as concerts and performances of ancient Aztec
dances. Plans call for enough space to be preserved to accommodate
such activities in the future, Encinas said.
	   Local residents and tourists reacted positively to the decision.
	   ``From a tourist point of view, it would probably be nice to
have more greenery in the city,'' said Matthew Cronin, of
Vancouver, Washington.
	   Isabel Sanchez, who has lived in Mexico City for more than 50
years, welcomed the news.
	   ``It was beautiful,'' she said. ``It would be nice if they made
it the way it used to be.''

Nicklaus finishes Senior Open with sizzling 67
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus finished strong Sunday,
following up a horrendous 79 with a 4-under-par 67 _ a better score
than anyone had achieved during the first three rounds _ at the
U.S. Senior Open.
	   ``Yesterday was obviously not a source of pride,'' Nicklaus said
with a chuckle. ``This is going to be the last round of golf I'm
going to play for a while. I played pretty well.
	   ``The rounds you play yesterday are always important _ the last
round. I had a blast today, that was fun. It's always fun to play
well. I shot myself out of the tournament yesterday. If I had shot
a 72, I'd be right there.''
	   Nicklaus, among the early starters Sunday, has had problems with
his left hip and limped noticeably in Thursday's opening round. He
has talked about undergoing hip replacement surgery in the future.
	   He had a different take on the subject following his round
Sunday, which gave him a 72-hole score of 292 _ eight-over par on
the rugged 6,906-yard (6,313-meter), par-71 Riviera Country Club
course.
	   ``My body was great, no problems whatsoever,'' Nicklaus said.
``My hip wasn't bad today. It got better each day, I'm very
encouraged.''
	   Pete Egosque of Del Mar, California, has been working with
Nicklaus, prescribing an exercise program.
	   ``I call him an anatomical functionalist,'' Nicklaus said of
Egosque. ``My first option is to exercise, I haven't been able to
exercise. I've got to get weight off. That will only help me if I
have to have an operation.''
	   However, Nicklaus said Egosque has proven to him the last couple
days he doesn't necessarily need surgery, and can play pain-free.
	   ``To do what I have to do, I'm going to have to change my life a
little bit,'' Nicklaus said. ``I'm a pretty disciplined guy to
start with. I'm going to have to be more disciplined.''
	   Nicklaus said for all intents and purposes, as far as structured
tournament golf is concerned, he's probably finished for the year.
	   ``My priority is going to be one thing _ that's to be as
physically fit as I can,'' he said. ``I'm not going to play
(tournament golf) until next year.''
	   Nicklaus, 58, was attempting to become the oldest winner of the
Senior Open, an event he has won twice in nine attempts.
	   Nicklaus has won 20 major championships on the PGA Tour
including six Masters, five PGA Championships, four U.S. Opens,
three British Opens and two U.S. Amateurs.

Pak wins fourth of the year as Pepper misses 4-footer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOWLAND, Ohio (AP) _ Se Ri Pak birdied the final hole and then
watched as Dottie Pepper missed a 4-footer (1.2-meter putt) for
birdie, giving the rookie sensation a one-shot victory Sunday in
the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic.
	   The victory was the 20-year-old Korean's fourth of the season
and deprived Pepper of her first win since 1996.
	   Pepper, seeking her 15th career victory and first in 45
tournaments, rolled in a 5-foot (1.5-meter) birdie putt on the 17th
hole to catch Pak at 14-under.
	   On No. 18, Pak hit a fairway wood for her second shot on the
451-yard (412-meter), par-5 hole that hit on the front edge of the
green and rolled 15 feet (4.6 meters) short and right of the cup.
	   Pepper, playing one group behind Pak, was watching from the
fairway as Pak just missed the eagle putt but tapped in for birdie
to cap a 5-under-par 67 and finish at 15-under 201.
	   Pepper said she was not watching the leaderboard, focusing on
her own play, and wasn't aware of the situation on the final green.
	   ``Amazing,'' she said. ``I had no idea what was going on. When I
saw Se Ri miss her putt, I thought she had missed her birdie. I had
no idea it was for eagle.''
	   Pepper pushed her fairway wood right, but got a favorable bounce
off a hump behind the greenside bunker, the ball rolling to a stop
40 feet (12 meters) right of the cup.
	   Pepper made a charge at what could have been the winning eagle
putt, hitting it four feet past the hole. A television camera
caught Pak yawning as she watched the drama.
	   While Pak turned away to go to the scorer's tent, Pepper rammed
the birdie putt past the cup on the right side to give Pak the dlrs
120,000 first-place check.
	   ``People told me, `Playoff.' Then they said, `You win!' I didn't
know I win,'' Pak said.
	   Pepper, too, wasn't immediately aware of what had happened,
thinking she had gotten into a playoff with Pak even after
three-putting.
	   Not until she saw her caddie, John Killeen, take off his caddie
bib did she realize she had lost.
	   ``I asked John why he was taking his bib off. I said, `We're
going back to the tee, aren't we,' '' she said as her eyes began to
fill with tears. ``He said no.''
	   Pak has been on an incredible tear on the LPGA tour the last
month.
	   After capturing the LPGA Championship _ the year's first
grand-slam event _ Pak has won three of her last four starts. The
streak started with a dramatic 20-hole playoff victory over amateur
Jenny Chuasiriporn in the U.S. Women's Open. A week later, she set
LPGA records for 18-hole score (61), back-to-back rounds (61-63)
and 72-hole total (261) while winning the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic
by nine strokes.
	   In the Giant Eagle, she had rounds of 65, 69 and 67 with only
one bogey in the entire tournament.
	   Pak started the day tied for third, three shots back of Pepper.
But Pepper got off to a rocky start, hitting her drive on the first
hole into a lake and dropping out of the lead with a double bogey.
	   Pak was steady, posting three birdies and her lone bogey on the
front side before making birdies at No. 10, the 15th and the
closing hole.
	   The final round was more than a two-person struggle.
	   Robin Walton, who had nine birdies while tying the Avalon Lakes
course record with an 8-under 64, took the early lead at 13-under.
	   The 18th hole was Walton's undoing. While almost every player in
the field had little difficulty reaching the downwind par-5 in two
shots, she triple-bogeyed it the first day and had pars the last
two rounds.
	   Her 8 in the first round came when she hit her second shot into
the greenside bunker and failed to get her first sand shot out. She
was assessed a two-stroke penalty when she removed a golf
ball-sized stone from behind her ball before blasting out and
two-putting.
	   That would come back to haunt her after she ran off five birdies
in a span of seven holes on the back nine. She again faltered at
the 18th, hitting into the sand off the tee and having to get up
and down with a 5-foot (1.5-meter) putt to save par.
	   Pak's 7-foot (2.1-meter) birdie putt at the 10th pulled her even
with Walton, and a 6-footer (1.8-meter putt) at the 15th gave her
the lead by herself _ until Pepper birdied at 17 to pull even and
set the stage for the finish.
	   Walton finished alone in third at 13-under, with Kelly Robbins
shooting a closing 65 to share fourth place with Leta Lindley and
Pearl Sinn.

Car crash, bad hole can't stop Pate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD ULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUTTON, Massachusetts (AP) _ Steve Pate overcame his own wild
shots on the 18th hole of the CVS Charity Classic Sunday to win his
first tournament since a car crash knocked him off the PGA Tour for
nearly all of 1996.
	   Pate, once known for his hot temper, controlled it well after he
hooked his first three shots into the rough on the final hole,
putting his two-stroke lead in jeopardy. He recovered by calmly
knocking his fourth shot on the green, then needed just two putts
on the 583-yard (533-meter) final hole.
	   Willie Wood, playing in the last twosome in the last PGA event
at Pleasant Valley, could have caught up with an eagle on the 18th,
but finished with a par.
	   Pate's bogey on the 18th gave him a one-stroke win, his first
victory since 1992, over Scott Hoch and Bradley Hughes. Pate shot
4-under-par 67 for a 15-under 269 and the top prize of dlrs
270,000. Hoch shot 65 and Hughes 66 on the 7,110-yard (6,499-meter)
Pleasant Valley layout.
	   Wood (70), Nolan Henke (67) and Mike Heinen (67) were another
stroke back at 271.
	   The first PGA tournament at the course was in 1965, but this
year's title sponsor, CVS, wouldn't accept unfavorable dates
offered by the PGA for next year. After a two-year break, the tour
has been held annually at Pleasant Valley. Pate is the 32nd
different winner in 32 years.
	   Wood shared the third-round lead with Dave Stockton Jr., whose
71 Sunday left him at 272.
	   Until the 18th, Pate, 37, had rallied on the back nine with four
birdies and four pars. He had come a long way since an accident put
his career on hold.
	   He was driving home from the Phoenix Open in January 1996 when,
he said, ``I drove my car into a truck at 75 mph (121-kmh). I was
going 25.''
	   He broke a facial bone but, more damaging for a golfer, he broke
his right hand and wrist. ``Other than that,'' he said, ``I did all
right.''
	   Except for his only bogey on the 18th, he did just fine on
Sunday.
	   He trailed Henke, who was 14 under at the time, by one stroke
after he birdied the 10th hole. And when Henke bogeyed the 14th,
Pate's birdie at the 12th gave him a lead he never lost.
	   Hoch did tie Pate for the lead when he sank a birdie at the
17th, leaving both at 14 under. But consecutive birdies at the
371-yard (339-meter) 15th, which he bogeyed on Saturday, and the
200-yard (183-meter) 16th gave Pate enough of a cushion for his
first win since the 1992 Buick Invitational of California.

Illegal immigrants fight over food
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with report Tunisia failed to escort boat back, Dini's
comments; another melee; EDITS to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ In the latest tensions over illegal immigration,
police broke up riots Sunday among detained North Africans fighting
over a sandwich on a tiny Sicilian island and among other illegal
immigrants facing expulsion from Italy.
	   Trying to stem further clandestine arrivals, an Italian coast
guard ship urged Tunisian naval authorities to escort back a boat
packed with would-be immigrants.
	   RAI state TV showed coast guardsmen tossing plastic bottles of
mineral water to some 70 Tunisians crammed into an open-topped,
13-meter (40-foot) long boat) that was trying to make it to Italian
shores under a broiling sun.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA, reporting from the coast guard
vessel, said that a Tunisian naval ship agreed that the boat would
be escorted back to a Tunisian port. But hours later, Italian RAI
state radio reported that the escort ship never showed up and that
the Italians were leading the boat full of Tunisians to Lampedusa,
a tiny Italian island between Sicily and North Africa.
	   RAI quoted Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who was
beginning a visit Sunday night to Morocco, as saying that Morocco
was cooperating to discourage the immigration while Tunisia was
tolerating the exodus.
	   It was on Lampedusa where the brawl began late Saturday night
among 147 Tunisians and Moroccans have been held for two weeks
while awaiting processing to be sent back home.
	   RAI reported that the riot began when a Tunisian refused to give
up the sandwich that was distributed to him to another who demanded
it.
	   Another riot, among some 300 North Africans held in the Sicilian
port city of Agrigento, broke out Sunday night, RAI said, and
police called for reinforcements.
	   Under the European Union's open borders policy, Italy is obliged
to send illegal immigrants home.
	   Italian newspapers reported Sunday that the opposition Northern
League party would start seeking support in the Senate Monday to
bring a no-confidence motion against Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano.
	   Napolitano has promised aid to North African countries if they
will better patrol their coasts to prevent the nightly exodus to
Italy.
	   Clandestine arrivals earlier this year by hundreds of Kurdish
refugees from Turkey prompted Germany to accuse Italy of laxity on
stopping refugees, who often move on to northern Europe.
	   Warm temperatures and calm seas this month have aided the
clandestine runs of boats packed with North Africans seeking jobs
in Italy or elsewhere in Europe.
	   Roughly 3,000 people trying to slip in by sea have been tracked
since July 1.

Miner reported alive nine days after Austrian mine accident

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A miner feared dead after a massive
landslide buried him and 10 others in a talc mine was rescued late
Sunday. There was no word on the 10 others.
	   Austrian television interrupted its regular programming as Georg
Hainzl was hoisted by cables from the 60-meter (200-foot)
subterranean eating area where he was trapped by a mudslide during
heavy rains July 17.
	   A second, larger mudslide buried 10 others who had been sent to
rescue him after the accident in the town of Lassing, 200
kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna.
	   They are believed to have plunged to the bottom of the mine when
the mudslide cut the cable of their emergency elevator.
	   Floodlights were shut off during the late night rescue as Hainzl
was brought to the surface to avoid damaging his eyes after nine
days in darkness.
	   Hainzl, whose pregnant girlfriend was on hand, was examined by
doctors at the scene. He was expected to be transported to a
hospital in the provincial capital Graz. There was no word on his
condition.
	   Earlier in the day, Austrian officials had said there was no
chance that Hainzl or the others could still be alive so long after
the accident.
	   Austrian television had reported earlier Sunday that the rescue
operation was virtually over and that the area would be ``secured''
against further mudslides so as not to endanger those trying to
retrieve the bodies.
	   But later Sunday, the teams heard what they thought was a voice.
After lowering a microphone into an emergency shaft, Hainzl made
voice contact and said his only complaint was that his feet were
cold and wet.
	   Austrian President Thomas Klestil said the ``miracle of
Lassing'' showed ``how important it is never to give up in the
fight for human lives despite apparent hopelessness.''
	   The mudslides left a crater 50 meters (165 feet) deep and about
150 meters (500 feet) in diameter. Several houses in the small
mountain community tumbled into the pit.
	   Since the accident, rescue operations have been hampered by the
instability of the water-filled crater, subsequent rainfalls and an
apparent lack of information about unused shafts and subterranean
galleries.
	   The operations manager was replaced after several days. An
expert from Austria's only mining university, appointed to
investigate the accident, quit soon afterward because of what he
termed ``bias.''

	   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. (AP) _ The Chinese gymnast paralyzed in a fall
at the Goodwill Games was able to sit up Sunday after successful
spinal surgery, but doctors repeated that she probably would never
walk again.
	   After the seven-hour operation Saturday to rebuild her upper
spine, Sang Lan regained some strength in her shoulders and biceps,
said Dr. Vincent Leone, director of spinal surgery at Nassau County
Medical Center. But there was no immediate improvement in mobility
in her hands, wrists and legs, he said.
	   The operation, which stabilized her spine, allowed Sang, 17, to
sit up in bed, something that was impossible before the surgery,
said Leone.
	   Given the complexity of the injury and the healing process, it
was too soon to say how quickly the gymnast would progress and what
her final prognosis would be, he said, adding that it was unlikely
she would ever walk again. He made the same statement on Wednesday,
the day after the accident.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, struck the mat
with her head after missing a simple vault during practice.
	   The goal of Saturday's surgery was to stabilize Sang's spine by
screwing three titanium plates into the injured section of her
neck. Surgeons also removed broken bone fragments and used bits of
bone from her left hip to fuse vertebrae.
	   ``The implants basically prevent her head from falling off her
shoulders,'' Leone said.
	   Sang also is being treated with an experimental nerve drug that
doctors said was her only hope of walking again. But it was too
early to say if the drug, which provides the building blocks for
nerves to repair themselves, was working, Leone said.
	   Sang's parents, who arrived from China just hours after the
surgery, were driven from Kennedy Airport to the hospital and did
not speak to reporters. They plan to give a news conference in the
next several days, said hospital spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg.
	   Sang will have to stay at the hospital for at least a week, and
her parents have not decided whether to continue her treatment here
or move her back home.
	   Before her parents left China, Sang's saddened friends made
1,000 paper birds for the couple to take with them _ symbols of
their wishes for a quick recovery.
	   Sang's parent's rarely saw their only child, who was chosen for
national-team training when she was 11. Since then, her parents
have seen her only three times, most recently in October, while she
trained in Beijing, 740 miles (1,190 kilometers) from home.
	   Physicians and others who visited Sang on Sunday said that she
was in high spirits.
	   ``This young lady did not stop talking,'' said Nassau County
Executive Thomas Gulotta. ``Her spirit was uplifting. You had to be
encouraged to be in her presence.''
	   Gulotta said Sang asked to watch the Goodwill Games on Sunday
night and the hospital would arrange a special TV feed for her.
	   Goodwill Games spokesman Michael Lewellen reiterated an earlier
pledge by the event's sponsor, Turner Sports, and its parent
company, Time-Warner Inc., to provide all possible resources to
secure the family's future. Details had yet to be finalized, he
said.
	   ``The family has only been here for a few hours,'' he said.
``They haven't had the opportunity to state their wishes.''

Brazilians win beach volleyball gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, results from other events; WILL BE
UPDATED with evening results. &QL; 
 &UR; With Sports-China-Goodwill-Gymnast &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ On a pile of sand dumped on an ice-skating rink
surrounded by skyscrapers, a pair of Brazilians showed why they are
the world's top-ranked beach volleyball team and kept the sport's
senior dude from adding another victory to his record list.
	   Guilherme Marques and Para Ferreira beat the U.S. team of Karch
Kiraly and Adam Johnson 12-11, 12-4 Sunday to win the gold medal at
the Goodwill Games.
	   With almost 1 million pounds (460,000 kilos) of sand imported
from Canada to cover Wollman Rink in Central Park, a sport that's
used to endless horizons of the seashore was played with huge shade
trees nearby and the office buildings, hotels and apartment towers
of midtown Manhattan looming above.
	   A near-capacity crowd of 2,800 was charged up early, hoping to
see the 37-year-old Kiraly, who is often mentioned as his sport's
Babe Ruth, Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan, add another title to
the 130 he has won over his 12-year career.
	   It started well for the U.S. team, but the Brazilians, the
defending world champions, took control late in the first game and
dominated the second to sweep the best-of-3 match for the gold
medal.
	   The Brazilians, who shared dlrs 30,000 as champions, definitely
had age on their side, with the 29-year-old Guilherme five years
older than Para, who is considered the best player in the world
right now. Johnson, 33, and Kiraly, partners on the U.S.
professional circuit, split dlrs 20,000 for winning the silver.
	   ``You can look at the score and say `Oh, that was easy,' but
it's not just the score,'' Guilherme said. ``This tournament was
very difficult with a lot of great players, especially one today
who has a lot of international experience.''
	   The U.S. team had a 9-6 lead in the opening game, but the
Brazilians ran off five straight points to set up a game point.
Kiraly and Johnson managed to tie it 11-11 with Kiraly making a
great diving save on one point and coming up with a great stuff at
the net for the other.
	   The Brazilians got the serve back on the next play, then put the
opening game away with an immediate point.
	   Guilherme and Para _ just like Brazil's soccer player, they
usually go by one name only _ took command of the second game with
a 6-point run for an 8-1 lead. The second game was much closer to
the early round meeting that Brazil won 15-3, Kiraly and Johnson's
only loss before the gold medal match.
	   ``Even after the first game we thought we were in good shape,''
Kiraly said. ``We took them out of their game but they still played
really well and beat us. They picked it up and we didn't.''
	   Kiraly was terse when asked if the United States had to give up
the mantle of best beach volleyball country in the world to Brazil.
	   ``They're playing very well right now,'' he said.
	   The air temperature was 81 degrees (27.22 Celsius) and a
thermometer in the sand registered 102 degrees (38.89 Celsius),
well off the 125 (51.67 Celsius) that was recorded earlier in the
week.
	   In the match for the bronze medal, Martin Conde and Eduardo
Martinez of Argentina beat Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner of
Australia 12-11, 12-9.
	   What Kiraly and Johnson couldn't do, the U.S. wrestlers could _
win gold.
	   They beat Russia 16-14 for the title, with victories from Sam
Henson, Tony Purler, Cary Kolat, Lincoln McIlravy and Les Gutches.
	   Turkey beat Iran 16-13 for the bronze medal in a meet that had
none of the loud political protests by anti-Tehran exiles that
disrupted the U.S. win over the Iranians Saturday night.
	   U.S. cyclists won gold, too, taking an unusual two-day team race
over a squad of men and women riders from a handful of countries.
Russia was third.
	   At the diving pool, world champion Dmitry Sautin of Russia won
the men's 3-meter springboard, beating Troy Dumais of the United
States by almost 49 points. Dumais led early but Sautin, the
Olympic platform champion, registered a string of 8.5's and 9's to
win.
	   Gymnastics concluded with Huang Xu and Ling Jie of China taking
gold in the mixed team event, edging women's world champion
Svetlana Korkina and Alexei Nemov of Russia by 0.275 points. Anna
Kovaleva and Aleksei Bondorenko of Russia took the bronze, the
sixth medal of the games for Bondorenko, tying a meet record.
	   Doctors, meanwhile, reported that paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang
Lan was able to sit up Sunday after surgery that rebuilt her upper
spine, fractured in a practice accident on the vault. But they
repeated earlier statements that the 17-year-old probably would
never walk again.

McEnroe serves up victory over Connors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Michigan (AP) _ John McEnroe hit four aces in
the Champions Tiebreaker to defeat Jimmy Connors 6-2, 2-6, 10-5
Sunday and capture the Mentadent Joe Dumars Champions senior tennis
tournament.
	   It was the 40th time McEnroe and Connors have met during their
careers. McEnroe won 23 of their 33 on the men's tour, but trails
3-4 on the senior circuit.
	   ``It's been a while since I've beaten Jimmy in a big match,''
McEnroe said. ``From the first day I got into tennis until today,
Jimmy was there. So every time I look at what I've accomplished, I
have to compare it to Jimmy to see how I measure up.''
	   The match was marked by several swings in momentum and hinged on
big serving by McEnroe in the third set Champions Tiebreaker.
	   In the third set Champions Tiebreaker, McEnroe grabbed an 8-3
lead with four spectacular aces. A service winner and a forehand
return wide from Connors gave McEnroe his first senior circuit win
over Connors since 1995.
	   ``When he serves like he did in the tiebreaker, what are you
going to do?'' asked Connors. ``He got what, four free points off
his serve? He has the ability to do that when it counts, and that's
why he's who he is and where he is, not just today, but for the
last 20 years.''
	   The win gave McEnroe his second senior circuit victory of the
season and put him solidly in third place in the Nuveen Masters
Point Standings. Despite the loss, Connors regained the point lead
from Bjorn Borg.
	   The Mentadent Joe Dumars Champions is the fifth event on the
1998-99 Nuveen Tour schedule and the seventh event on the worldwide
senior tennis circuit, which continues Aug. 5-9 in Wellesley,
Massachusetts.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. loss, Cuba win, other results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Loidel Chapelli's home run highlighted a five-run
third inning and Yosvani Aragon tossed a five-hitter as Cuba
trounced China 10-0 Sunday to stay unbeaten at the Baseball World
Championship.
	   The five-time defending titlists took over sole possession of
first place in Pool A because the Dominican Republic lost to Japan
4-3. Cuba has won 36 consecutive games at the worlds.
	   In Pool B, Australia is 5-0 after beating Taiwan 6-2. Grant
McDonald had three singles to raise his tournament batting average
to .450, Nathan Peterson drove in two runs with a double and Andrew
Scott added two hits for Australia.
	   The United States' two-game winning streak ended in a 9-2 defeat
against Nicaragua (4-1). Ryan Ludwick and Patrick Boyd homered for
the Americans (2-3) _ the team's only hits. The game was tied 1-1
after four innings, but Nicaragua scored in each inning the rest of
the way.
	   Elsewhere in Pool B, Colin Dixon's solo home run in the eighth
inning gave Canada a 3-2 comeback win, keeping the North Americans
in the race for a quarterfinal spot.
	   Canada trailed 2-0 after four innings, but reliever Dave Ross
came in to shut down Russia (0-5) with five innings of no-hit
pitching. Outfielder Joe Colameco helped spark Canada (3-2) at the
plate, going 3-for-4 with a triple, and Dixon struck the winning
blow.
	   Canada is tied for third in Pool B with South Korea, which
handed the Netherlands its third straight defeat, 8-4, as Park
Han-Yi and Kang Hyuk hit homers.
	   In other Pool A action Sunday, Spain beat South Africa 6-3 and
Italy edged Panama 5-4.
	   The teams get a day off Monday. Preliminary round play resumes
Tuesday, with the top four teams from each group advancing to the
quarterfinals.

Three spectators killed, Moore wins wild race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLYN, Michigan (AP) _ Three spectators were killed _ the
first fan deaths at a major race in the United States in more than
a decade _ and six were injured by flying debris from a one-car
crash at the U.S. 500 Sunday at Michigan Speedway.
	   A tire and some suspension pieces from Adrian Fernandez's car
flew into the fourth-turn grandstand, killing two people
immediately. A third person could not be resuscitated.
	   The race went on, as there was no way for the drivers to know
the tragedy that what was taking place, and Greg Moore made the
last of a record-shattering 62 lead changes on the final lap and
held off Jimmy Vasser and Alex Zanardi to win the race.
	   ``People came here to watch us race and put on a good show,
which we did today,'' Moore said. ``But that tragedy definitely
puts a damper on it.''
	   None of the dead and injured were immediately identified. Tommy
Cameron, a speedway spokesman, said all were adults.
	   The six injured spectators were all in stable condition with
injuries ranging from fractured leg to neck and back pain, said
Robin Kirkpatrick, a spokeswoman for Foote Hospital.
	   They were the first fatalities at a Championship Auto Racing
Team event _ or any other major oval track race _ since the 1987
Indy 500, when a tire came off a car and was struck by Roberto
Guerrero's car, sending it into the top row of the grandstand and
killing a fan.
	   There have been other spectator deaths in the ensuing years at
drag races and other less prestigious events.
	   Fernandez, who was running third, slid up into the wall on lap
175 of the 250-lap race on the 2-mile (3.2-kilometer), high-banked
oval.
	   His right front tire and pieces of the suspension broke off and
flew into the crowd. Fernandez sustained bruises to both knees.
	   As the race was nearing the finish, it appeared either Vasser or
Zanardi, the Target-Chip Ganassi Racing teammates who had combined
to win six consecutive races, including the last four in a row by
Zanardi, were going to win the wild 500-mile (800-kilometer) event.
	   The last of seven caution flags was waved on lap 241 when Gil de
Ferran, who was running second at the time, blew his engine. That
left Vasser in the lead, Zanardi second and Moore fourth, just
behind former Michigan winner Scott Pruett.
	   On the restart with five laps to go, Vasser got a good jump
while Moore, a 23-year-old Canadian, quickly sped past Pruett and
took a bead on the two Ganassi drivers.
	   The aggressive youngster, who came up with his second win of the
season and the fourth of his career, led for part of lap 148, but
then slipped behind Vasser.
	   He stayed in second on lap 249, fending off Zanardi's challenge,
then went after the leader at the start of the last lap.
	   Moore, driving for Player's Forsythe Racing, drove his
Reynard-Mercedes underneath Vasser's Reynard-Honda heading into the
first turn of the 250th lap, grabbed the lead and pulled away to
the victory.
	   Vasser then had his hands full with his teammate, barely beating
Zanardi for second place.
	   ``It was flat out from beginning to end,'' Moore said. ``I knew
the Mercedes (engine) would be reliable enough. You just had to get
the breaks.
	   ``We stalled the car twice in the pits because we had a bit of a
mechanical problem, but we managed to bounce back.''
	   Vasser, the 1996 U.S. 500 winner, said, ``I just led the wrong
lap. I had to give Greg room. After the restart, I had 10
car-lengths, but suddenly they came flying right past me.''
	   The Handford Device, a bulky, boxy rear wing intended to add
drag to the cars and slow them down, kept race speeds under 230 mph
(370 kmh). But the new aerodynamics also made drafting and passing
easier, creating closer racing than usual for the open-wheel cars.
	   In fact, the previous record for lead changes in a 500-mile
(800-kilometer) Champ car race was 27, set at Michigan in 1982 and
matched in 1985.
	   Ten drivers were on the lead lap at the end, with Pruett third,
followed by Richie Hearn, Michael Andretti, Bobby Rahal, Patrick
Carpentier, Paul Tracy and Bryan Herta.
	   Robby Gordon and J.J. Lehto also had one-car incidents. Gordon
was not injured and Lehto came away with a bruised right knee.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A miner feared dead after a massive
landslide buried him and 10 others in a talc mine was rescued late
Sunday. There was no word on the 10 others.
	   Austrian television interrupted its regular programming as Georg
Hainzl was hoisted by cables from the 60-meter (200-foot)
subterranean eating area where he was trapped by a mudslide during
heavy rains July 17.
	   A second, larger mudslide buried 10 others who had been sent to
rescue him after the accident in the town of Lassing, 200
kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna.
	   They are believed to have plunged to the bottom of the mine when
the mudslide cut the cable of their emergency elevator.
	   Floodlights were shut off during the late night rescue as Hainzl
was brought to the surface to avoid damaging his eyes after nine
days in darkness.
	   Hainzl, whose pregnant girlfriend was on hand, was examined by
doctors at the scene. He was expected to be transported to a
hospital in the provincial capital Graz. There was no word on his
condition.
	   Earlier in the day, Austrian officials had said there was no
chance that Hainzl or the others could still be alive so long after
the accident.
	   Austrian television had reported earlier Sunday that the rescue
operation was virtually over and that the area would be ``secured''
against further mudslides so as not to endanger those trying to
retrieve the bodies.
	   But later Sunday, the teams heard what they thought was a voice.
After lowering a microphone into an emergency shaft, Hainzl made
voice contact and said his only complaint was that his feet were
cold and wet.
	   Austrian President Thomas Klestil said the ``miracle of
Lassing'' showed ``how important it is never to give up in the
fight for human lives despite apparent hopelessness.''
	   The mudslides left a crater 50 meters (165 feet) deep and about
150 meters (500 feet) in diameter. Several houses in the small
mountain community tumbled into the pit.
	   Since the accident, rescue operations have been hampered by the
instability of the water-filled crater, subsequent rainfalls and an
apparent lack of information about unused shafts and subterranean
galleries.

Three fans killed in U.S. 500 crash

	   BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) _ Three spectators were killed and six
others injured Sunday when a tire and pieces of a car flew into the
grandstand during a crash at the U.S. 500 auto race.
	   This was the first time in more than a decade that spectators
were killed at a major auto race.
	   Dr. Gregory Baumann, the chief medical director at Michigan
Speedway, said two people died instantly from the impact of the
debris. A third person later died at one of the track's medical
units.
	   Six spectators were taken by helicopter to Foote Hospital in
nearby Jackson. Hospital spokeswoman Robin Kirkpatrick said the six
are all stable with injuries ranging from a fractured leg to neck
and back pain.
	   All of the dead and injured were adults, track officials said.
	   A car driven by Adrian Fernandez of Mexico, the pole winner for
the CART race, slid into the wall on lap 175 of the 250-lap race,
run on a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer), high-banked oval.
	   His right front tire and pieces of the suspension broke off,
flying into the crowd in the fourth-turn grandstand. Fernandez, who
was in third place at the time of the crash, sustained bruised
knees.
	   The fourth-turn grandstand area where the spectators were hit
was cleared immediately and a medical examiner's investigation was
begun.
	   This was the first spectator death at the track since 1969 when
one fan was killed during a Trans-Am race on the road course.
	   At the 1987 Indy 500, a tire bounded off the track, landing in
the top row of the grandstand and killing a fan. There have been
other spectator deaths since at drag races and other auto events.
	   The U.S. 500, run before a crowd of about 50,000, continued
after the accident and was won By Greg Moore.
	   ``People came here to watch us race and put on a good show,
which we did today,'' Moore said. ``But that tragedy definitely
puts a damper on it.''

Sautin wins third diving gold for Russia, American Dumais takes

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Dmitry Sautin already had proved he
was the best diver in the world. The Russian merely confirmed it at
the Goodwill Games.
	   Sautin, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the 1994 and 1998
world champion on the platform, captured gold in the 3-meter
springboard Sunday, duplicating his 1998 world title in that event.
	   Sautin easily defeated U.S. teen-ager Troy Dumais, whose
silver-medal performance was a major climb from his 10th-place
finish in 3-meter at the World Championships in Perth, Australia.
	   Sautin never failed to get at least one mark of 8.5 or better on
each of his 11 dives and finished with 696.99 points, while Dumais,
18, of Ventura, California, was second with 648.15.
	   ``I try not to miss too many dives, but I'm human, I'm alive,''
Sautin said. ``Good training and the coach definitely play a major
part. I've been training since childhood. I started platform diving
when I was 9 years old.''
	   Dumais was 10th in the Goodwill 1-meter, an event in which he
finished second at the World Championships, and he criticized
himself for allowing ``stupid thoughts'' to enter his head.
	   ``Today, all I did was concentrate on doing my dive,'' Dumais
said. ``I sort of think in the opposite direction. Instead of
thinking (a dive) downwards, I think upwards.''
	   Dumais called Sautin ``a diving machine,'' but said he could
beat the Russian before too long.
	   ``This second-place finish gives me confidence in the future,''
he said. ``This should help me a a lot.''
	   Zhou Yilin of China won the bronze medal with 636.78 points. Zou
won the silver medal in the 1-meter ahead of Mark Ruiz of Orlando,
Florida, who was 10th in the 3-meter.

	   BROOKLYN, Michigan (AP) _ Three spectators were killed and six
others injured Sunday when a tire and pieces of a car flew into the
grandstand during a crash at the U.S. 500 auto race.
	   This was the first time in more than a decade that spectators
were killed at a major auto race.
	   Dr. Gregory Baumann, the chief medical director at Michigan
Speedway, said two people died instantly from the impact of the

	   Six spectators were taken by helicopter to Foote Hospital in
nearby Jackson, where they were listed in stable condition with
injuries ranging from a fractured leg to neck and back injuries,
hospital officials said.
	   All of the dead and injured were adults, track officials said.
	   A car driven by Adrian Fernandez of Mexico, the pole winner for
the CART race, slid into the wall on lap 175 of the 250-lap race,
run on a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer), high-banked oval.
	   His right front tire and pieces of the suspension broke off,

	   The fourth-turn grandstand area where the spectators were hit

	   This was the first spectator death at the track since 1969 when
one fan was killed during a Trans-Am race on the road course.

	   ``People came here to watch us race and put on a good show,
which we did today,'' Moore said. ``But that tragedy definitely
puts a damper on it.''
	   Jimmy Vasser, the runner-up, added, ``It's terrible, a tragedy.
We don't want to see that happen.''
	   The debris cleared a concrete wall and a debris fence before
reaching the spectators.
	   Greg Penske, president of Penske Motorsports Inc., which owns
the track, said one of the victims was in the eighth row and
another in about the 10th.
	   ``The wall is 4 feet (1.2 meters) above the track surface and
there's 11 feet (3.35 meters) of fence and cable,'' he said. ``So
there's 15 feet (4.6 meters) from the track surface to the top of
the fence.''
	   Gene Haskett, the speedway president, said there is no way to
say how tall such a fence should be to prevent this kind of an
accident.
	   ``It's impossible to say how high something would bounce or fly
over,'' he said. ``Thirty-one years of racing here on the oval and
this being our first incident of this nature is just something
that's very, very unfortunate.''
	   The track set up a telephone hotline for people trying to learn
if friends or family were among the dead and injured. The number is
1-517-592-1120.

Reforestation to begin in fire-damaged Mexican reserves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ More than 700,000 trees will be planted in
three ecological reserves in southern Mexico which suffered
widespread damage from wildfires this year, Chiapas state
environment officials said.
	   A severe drought had turned the normally lush rain forests _ La
Sepultura, La Frailescana and El Triunfo _ into tinder for the
fires, which smoldered for weeks and clouded skies with smoke as
far north as the U.S. plains states.
	   The Chiapas state Environment Secretariat announced Saturday it
would begin an intense reforestation campaign with the help of
private groups and the army, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
	   Plans also call for the planting of 30,000 coffee plants and the
collection of seeds from trees and plants affected by the fires,
the report said.

 &UR; Boston Red Sox 6, Toronto Blue Jays 3

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Nomar Garciaparra hit a three-run inside-the-park
homer, and Pedro Martinez pitched seven scoreless innings Sunday to
lead the Boston Red Sox to a 6-3 victory over the Toronto Blue
Jays.
	   Martinez (14-3) gave up six hits and one walk, he struck out six
and allowed only two batters as far as third base before leaving
with a 5-0 lead. He won for the eighth time in nine starts.
	   Pat Hentgen (9-8) allowed five runs on 10 hits and two walks in
seven innings. He lost his fourth straight decision.
 &UR; Kansas City Royals 9, Anaheim Angels 4
	   At Kansas City, Missouri Jose Offerman extended his hitting
streak to a career-high 15 games with a single during a five-run
first inning and the Kansas City Royals beat the Anaheim Angels.
	   Offerman doubled, singled twice, walked and scored twice. He has
reached base in 16 of his last 22 plate appearances. Dean Palmer
and Jeff Conine each drove in two runs for the Royals.
	   The American League-West-leading Angels fell to 7-15 in July.
Anaheim's Garret Anderson stretched his career-high hitting streak
to 23 games _ one behind Boston's Nomar Garciaparra for the longest
in the AL this season.
	   The Royals had six straight one-out hits in the first against
Omar Olivares (5-7). Jose Rosado (5-8) was the winner.
 &UR; Minnesota Twins 11, Texas Rangers 3
	   At Minneapolis, Todd Walker kept up his tear with four more
hits, including a three-run homer, and the Minnesota Twins beat the
Texas Rangers for their first three-game sweep of the season.
	   Walker, who has reached base in his last 10 plate appearances,
finished the six-game homestand 15-for-20 and raised his average to
.352.
	   Marty Cordova homered and drove in four runs for Minnesota.
	   Juan Gonzalez hit his 31st homer, a two-run shot in the Texas
sixth. His only hit of the series increased his major
league-leading RBIs total to 116.
	   LaTroy Hawkins (7-9) was the winner and Rick Helling (13-6) took
the loss.
 &UR; New York Yankees 6, Chicago White Sox 3
	   At New York, Bernie Williams' tiebreaking solo homer triggered a
three-run sixth inning that carried the New York Yankees over the
Chicago White Sox.
	   David Wells (12-2) allowed three runs and seven hits with 10
strikeouts in 7 2-3 innings, improving to 8-0 in 10 starts at home.
New York is 73-26, the best 99-game start ever for a Yankees team.
They are one win off the pace of the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates for
the best start this century.
	   Scott Brosius added a two-run single in the sixth to make it 6-3
and finish off White Sox right-hander Jamie Navarro (8-12).
	   Albert Belle hit his 31st home run for the White Sox. Jorge
Posada hit a two-run homer for New York.
 &UR; Seattle Mariners 10, Baltimore Orioles 4
	   At Baltimore, Ken Griffey Jr. stole a career-high three bases
and scored three runs as the Seattle Mariners handed the Baltimore
Orioles their second straight loss.
	   Griffey went 1-for-2 with three walks but did not homer for a
third straight game and remained at 40 for the season. He had 10
steals in 12 attempts before having a perfect day against Baltimore
catcher Lenny Webster.
	   David Segui went 4-for-5 with two RBIs and the Mariners scored
five unearned runs en route to their ninth win in 12 games. Seattle
won the series 2-1 to end the Orioles' string of five straight
series wins.
	   B.J. Surhoff homered for the Orioles, who won 14 of 15 before
losing successive games for the first time since the All-Star
break.
	   Jamie Moyer (8-7) won his third straight decision. Scott
Erickson (11-8) had his three-game winning streak stopped.
 &UR; Detroit Tigers 8, Cleveland Indians 1
	   At Cleveland, switch-hitter Tony Clark hit home runs from both
sides of the plate to help Brian Moehler earn a rare road victory
as the Detroit Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians.
	   Moehler (11-7) allowed one run in 6 2-3 innings. The
right-hander, 9-0 at home, improved to 2-7 on the road.
	   Dwight Gooden (3-6) lost his third straight start.
 &UR; Tampa Bay Devil Rays 3, Oakland Athletics 1
	   At St. Petersburg, Florida, Wilson Alvarez won for the first
time in over two months and Fred McGriff hit a two-run homer as the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays equaled a season-best four-game winning streak
with a victory over the Oakland Athletics.
	   McGriff's third-inning shot off Tom Candiotti (5-13) broke a 1-1
tie. Alvarez (5-8) allowed one run and three hits in seven innings.
	   Mike Blowers snapped an 0-for-27 slump with a second-inning
homer as the A's matched a season-worst six-game losing skid.
	   Esteban Yan pitched two perfect innings for his first career
save.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A miner feared dead after a massive
landslide buried him and 10 others in a talc mine was rescued late
Sunday. There was no word on the 10 others.
	   Austrian television interrupted its regular programming as Georg
Hainzl, 24, was hoisted by cables from the 60 meter (200-foot)-deep
eating area where he was trapped by a mudslide during heavy rains
July 17.
	   A second, larger mudslide buried 10 others who had been sent to
rescue him after the accident in the town of Lassing, 190
kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna.
	   They are believed to have plunged to the bottom of the mine,
which produces the minerals used in refining talcum powder, when
the mudslide cut the cable of their emergency elevator.
	   Floodlights were shut off during the late night rescue as Hainzl
was brought to the surface to avoid damaging his eyes after nine
days in darkness.
	   Hainzl, whose pregnant girlfriend was on hand, was examined by
doctors at the scene and injected with fluids. Officials said he
also drank a liter of lemonade before being transported to a
hospital in the provincial capital Graz.
	   There was no official word on his condition but Austrian
television said he appeared in relatively good shape considering
the ordeal.
	   Earlier in the day, Austrian officials had said there was no
chance that Hainzl or the others could still be alive so long after
the accident.
	   But later Sunday, the teams decided to make one more attempt to
determine if anyone was still alive before the shaft was to be
sealed with cement.
	   The Austrian Press Agency said rescuers lowered a camera into an
emergency shaft. When they saw what they believed was survivor, the
rescuers then lowered a microphone.
	   Hainzl made voice contact and said his only complaint was that
his feet were cold and wet. A friend of Hainzl's volunteered to be
lowered into the shaft and retrieved him.
	   The mudslides left a crater 50 meters (165 feet) deep and about
150 meters (500 feet) in diameter. Several houses in the small
mountain community tumbled into the pit.
	   Austrian President Thomas Klestil said the ``miracle of
Lassing'' showed ``how important it is never to give up in the
fight for human lives despite apparent hopelessness.''
	   Since the accident, rescue operations have been hampered by the
instability of the water-filled crater, subsequent rainfalls and an
apparent lack of information about unused shafts and subterranean
galleries.
	   The operations manager was replaced after several days. An
expert from Austria's only mining university, appointed to
investigate the accident, quit soon afterward because of what he
termed ``bias.''

Spain downs United States 3-2 in marathon doubles to reach Fed Cup
</HEADLINE>
final &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Spain winning semifinal 3-2 &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain knocked the United States out of the
semifinal of the Federation Cup winning a marathon doubles match
for a final score of 3-2 Sunday.
	   Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez of Spain beat Lisa
Raymond and Mary Joe Fernandez 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 11-9 in a match that
lasted 3 hours, 40 minutes under floodlights.
	   The victory was sweet revenge for Spain following its 5-0
drubbing by the United States the last time they met in the Fed Cup
in Atlanta City in 1966.
	   In the first match of the day, Monica Seles crushed Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario 6-4, 6-0 to give the United States a 2-1 lead.
Saturday's play had ended in a 1-1 draw.
	   But Conchita Martinez, ranked seventh in the world, averted her
team's defeat by downing Lisa Raymond 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 before a
boisterous home crowd waving red and yellow Spanish flags.
	   Seles, ranked fifth in the world, dominated her first rematch
with No. 4 Sanchez Vicario since the latter beat her to take the
French Open last month.
	   Sanchez Vicario showed her trademark skill in chasing down just
about everything, but had trouble holding service. After holding
serve to go 2-2 in the first set she did not manage to do so again
for the rest of the match.
	   In the other singles match, Raymond was serving for the first
set at 5-4 but failed to hold service. It went to a tiebreaker in
which she was swamped 7-1.
	   In the second set, down 2-4, she fought back to 4-4. But in the
last two games she failed to win a single point.
	   On Saturday, Raymond started off strong in her singles match
against Sanchez Vicario, taking the first set 7-6 (7-4) and moving
to 2-0 in the second set. But the Spaniard came roaring back to
take that set and the third, 6-3 and 6-0.
	   In the other singles match Saturday, Seles downed Martinez 6-3,
3-6, 6-1.
	   Spain is a powerhouse in Fed Cup play, winning the title four
times between 1991 and 1995.

Congressional session ends without constitutional change
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSE MONEGRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ A constitutional change
allowing presidents to be re-elected appeared doomed as the
Dominican legislature ended its last regular session Sunday.
	   A newly elected legislature dominated by the Dominican
Revolutionary Party takes office Aug. 16, and it is expected to
block any amendment that might allow Dominican President Leonel
Fernandez a second term.
	   Fernandez could call a special session to consider the measure,
but observers said it was unlikely Congress would act on it.
	   ``We have to face reality, and it appears that the
constitutional reform is not going to be a possible,'' said Jose
Tomas Perez, publicity director for Fernandez's Dominican
Liberation Party.
	   The government put the one-term limit on the presidency in 1994
to limit the power of outgoing president and longtime political
strongman Joaquin Balaguer.
	   Since Fernandez's election in 1996, his party has been
frustrated in its attempts to push through free-market reforms.
Fernandez had hoped to get a second chance in 2000.
	   Those hopes dimmed when the Revolutionary Party, buoyed by the
death of its leader, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, snapped up 83 of
the 149 seats in the lower house and 24 of 30 in the Senate in the
May congressional elections.
	   Balaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party secured 17 seats in
the lower house and two in the Senate.
	   The wins gave the opposition parties the power to override
Fernandez's veto.
	   Liberation Party officers said privately they are now turning to
the task of choosing a presidential candidate to succeed Fernandez
in the 2000 election.
	   The party's vice president, Jaime David Fernandez, and secretary
Danilo Medina are frequently mentioned as possible nominees.

Three fans killed in U.S. 500 crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fan reaction, identities of injured, REWRITES
thruout. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLYN, Michigan (AP) _ As they heard the noise of a crash
below, brothers Gerald and Rich Bramer stood up to see what was
going on during the U.S. 500 on Sunday at Michigan Speedway.
	   ``The next thing I know, a tire was flying in the air right at
us,'' Gerald Bramer said.
	   Three spectators were killed and six others injured when the
one-car crash hurled a tire and other car parts into the grandstand
at the fourth turn. It was the first time in more than a decade
that spectators were killed at a major auto race.
	   All the dead and injured were adults, the track said. None of
the dead were immediately identified.
	   Dr. Gregory Baumann, the chief medical director at Michigan
Speedway, said two people died instantly from the impact of the
debris. A third person was taken to a track medical unit, where
resuscitation failed.
	   Six spectators were taken by helicopter to Foote Hospital in
Jackson. Hospital spokeswoman Robin Kirkpatrick said the six had
injuries ranging from a fractured leg to neck and back pain. All
were expected to be released Sunday night, she said.
	   The area where the fans were hit included a block of seats that
the hospital had complimentary tickets for, and one of the injured
worked at the hospital, Kirkpatrick said.
	   Gerald Bramer said he threw up his arm to block the tire from
Mexican driver Adrian Fernandez's car as it brushed by him. It hit
Rich Bramer in the back, but neither was injured seriously.
	   Becky Lutgen, the news director of Lansing's WLNS-TV, was at the
track with her boyfriend watching Fernandez's car as it rounded the
bend. She said they didn't see the tire from his car until it hit
the stands and then landed about four or five rows behind them.
	   ``It ricocheted in the stands and came to rest between some
rows. It went by so fast,'' Lutgen said.
	   Fernandez, the pole winner for the CART race, was running third
at the time of the crash and was left with bruised knees. His car
slid into the wall on lap 175 of the 250-lap race, run on a 2-mile,
high-banked oval.
	   This was the first spectator death at the track since 1969 when
one fan was killed during a Trans-Am race on the road course.
	   At the 1987 Indy 500, a tire bounded off the track, landing in
the top row of the grandstand and killing a fan. There have been
other spectator deaths since at drag races and other auto events.
	   The U.S. 500, run before a crowd of about 50,000, continued
after the accident and was won by Greg Moore.
	   ``People came here to watch us race and put on a good show,
which we did today,'' Moore said. ``But that tragedy definitely
puts a damper on it.''

Australian election observer: Cambodian vote not free and fair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Cambodia's weekend elections were not
free and fair in the way Australians would understand, an
Australian member of an international observer team and former
federal politician said Monday.
	   ``My conclusion ... is that it would be really impossible for us
to say this was a free and fair election, given what has happened
in the way of manipulation, the denial of human rights to
opposition political parties in various ways in the registration
and election process,'' former treasurer Ralph Willis told Radio
National from Cambodia.
	   ``So in that situation I couldn't come away saying this is a
fair and free election in the context that we would understand
that.''
	   The international observer group, of which Australia is a
member, refused to certify the election campaign as free and fair
but said it was possibly broadly representative.
	   An estimated 5.3 million voters _ nearly all who had registered
_ were reported by election officials to have cast ballots in
parliamentary elections Sunday, hoping for a fresh chance at peace
and stability. The elections were tarnished by a Khmer Rouge attack
that left 10 people dead.
	   Former Australian ambassador to Cambodia Tony Kevin said,
however, that voting had gone smoothly and bolstered Cambodia's
case to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   ``The opinion around town of most election observers that we
have met and talked to is that the voting had gone well without any
evident signs of fraud or intimidation at any polling stations,''
Kevin told Radio National.
	   ``Before we all go back into the old sterile debate about
whether voters were intimidated in the 12 months leading up to the
election or not, I think (leader) Hun Sen's trying to simply say to
ASEAN, take what we've done at it's face value, it's gone very
well.''
	   Kevin said Cambodia would rank ``pretty well above five'' on a
scale of one to 10 of democracy in both the election and the
campaign over the past three months.
	   ``I'm not sure whether the same can be said of a number of
another countries in the region.
	   ``If there is to be a single standard for all countries in
ASEAN, I think that Cambodia is well on the way to meeting that
standard now,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) _ As the sun set over the stone army
barracks where Fidel Castro launched his revolution 45 years ago
Sunday, thousands of communist faithful anticipated a message of
hope amid economic hardship as the Cuban leader took the podium.
	   ``In difficult moments, the people unite to support the
revolution,'' Manuel Valdez, 63, a retired soldier from this
eastern provincial city, said shortly before Castro took the stage.
``I am proud to be part of the revolution.''
	   Some 10,000 people crowded into a clearing before the Moncada
barracks where Castro and his followers launched a disastrous
offensive against the Cuban army.
	   ``We defend socialism with unmovable firmness!'' the government
supporters chanted.
	   Earlier in the day, some of Castro's first followers returned to
Granjita Siboney, the farming village where they spent the night
before the 1953 attack on the Moncada barracks that began the
uprising, to tell schoolchildren about the battle and to urge them
not to lose faith in the revolution.
	   ``When we were your age we didn't have even a tenth of what you
now have,'' Pedro Gutierrez, 69, told the children. ``We feel very
proud to have put our grain of sand into defeating the dictatorship
and helping to bring us everything that we have today.''
	   The children craned their necks and listened attentively to the
men who have become national heroes.
	   ``After hearing their words we are more clear about what
happened on that day _ and about what has been happening since
then,'' 13-year-old Ramon Enrique Suarez said. has taken a heavy
toll, and most foreign aid dried up almost a decade ago with the
collapse of the Soviet bloc.
	   Although few people are starving, poverty is widespread and
begging and prostitution are common in the main cities.
	   But the old rebels have few regrets. ``Despite the blockade and
the economic crisis, people are living better than we were in
1953,'' Jose Luis Lopez Villa, 74, said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Counting begins Monday for millions
of ballots cast by Cambodians in parliamentary elections,
expressing a hope for peace after decades of war and genocide. But
remnants of the murderous Khmer Rouge tarnished the day earlier
with an attack that left 10 people dead. The attack against a
military outpost in the northern jungles amounted to little more
than a spoiling tactic, but signaled that any new government must
still deal with what remains of the genocidal revolutionary group
that has terrorized Cambodia since the 1970s. Elsewhere, the
election unfolded in relative peace despite a violent run-up where
strongman Hun Sen was accused of murdering opponents and
intimidating voters to ensure victory for his Cambodian People's
Party. (CAMBODIA-ELECTION)
	   LONDON (AP) _ In the latest move to expand its reach, AT and T
is forming a joint venture with British Telecommunications that
will combine their international operations and develop a new
Internet-type of network. The tie-up, announced at a news
conference Sunday, follows the failure ot an earlier plan by BT to
acquire MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2 U.S. carrier behind AT
and T. BT was outbid by rival WorldCom Inc. ``The merging of our
international assets to form this global venture will enable BT and
AT and T to deliver in a unique and powerful way the seamless
global services our multinational customers need and want,'' AT and
T's president, John D. Zeglis, told reporters. The new company,
which has yet to be named, is expected to have revenues of dlrs 10
billion a year and employ some 5,000 people. It will be based in
the eastern United States and will be run by executives from both
BT and AT and T. The BT chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, will be its
first chairman. (BRITISH TELECOM-AT-and-T)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Two Capitol officers cut down in a burst of
gunfire will be honored Tuesday at a special ceremony at the
historic building where they worked and died. Their remains will
lie in the Rotunda, where the coffins of presidents and commanding
generals have rested. Capitol Police Chief Gary Abrecht announced
plans to memorialize the two ``fallen heroes'' as the suspect in
the shooting, Russell E. Weston Jr., lay in a hospital bed in
serious condition. Coffins bearing the remains of officers Jacob J.
Chestnut and John Gibson will be in the Capitol Rotunda early
Tuesday and remain there all day. (US-CAPITOL SHOOTINGS)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed groups killed at least 20 people
overnight in western Algeria, officials said, in the first
massacres since a U.N. fact-finding mission arrived to investigate
a Muslim insurgency. Security forces said Sunday that 12 people
were killed in the village of Khelil, near the town of Tlemcen on
the Moroccan border. Hospital sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said 15 were slashed to death and two wounded by
gunfire. Interior Minister Mustapha Benmansour visited the site,
and security forces were mobilized early Sunday to search for the
attackers, officials said. Another armed group killed eight people
overnight in Sidi Athmane near Saida, 420 kms (250 miles) southwest
of Algiers, authorities and hospital officials said.
(ALGERIA-VIOLENCE)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Hopes that a highway standoff between
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and Myanmar's military government
would end evaporated as she prepared to spend a third night in her
car. ``She is free to return to Yangon anytime, but she cannot
proceed to her destination,'' said a military officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity as he accompanied reporters to the scene
Sunday. Suu Kyi was stopped Friday morning 51 kilometers (32 miles)
west of the capital while driving to Bassein, 160 kilometers (100
miles) west of Yangon, to meet members of her political party. In
her battle to bring democracy to Myanmar, Suu Kyi has tried three
times in recent weeks to break away from her military security
detail and drive out to the provinces to meet supporters.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tom Hanks goes to war in ``Saving Private Ryan''
and feels immensely lucky it was only make-believe.
	   '' I'm glad I didn't have to fight in any war,'' Hanks, 42, says
in Sunday's USA Weekend magazine. ``I'm glad I didn't have to pick
up a gun. I'm glad I didn't get killed or have to kill somebody. I
hope my kids enjoy the same lack of manhood.''
	   Hanks, who won best actor Academy Awards for ``Philadelphia''
and ``Forrest Gump,'' thinks Steven Spielberg's take on the horrors
and moral dilemmas of war is as educational as it is entertaining.
	   ``I can't fight in WWII, but maybe I can do my part to help
people understand,'' Hanks said.
	   ``Without giving anything away, the first 25 minutes is set on
Omaha Beach and it's purely hell on earth. By the time they start
gunning down Germans trying to surrender, you honestly don't want
to see anybody ever kill anybody again.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Natasha Richardson has trouble getting up for
happy roles like the perky single mom she plays in ``The Parent
Trap.''
	   ``It's the light, bright parts I have to work at,'' Richardson,
35, says in the July 31 Entertainment Weekly. ``It's weird, but
where I'm comfortable going is where the emotionally painful stuff
is. That's where I feel a connection I can channel into.''
	   One element of the rosy remake's plot, in which twins try to
reunite their divorced parents, did bother Richardson though: the
fact that the parents split the two girls up when they went their
separate ways.
	   ``What kind of mother FedExes one of the twins off to Napa and
says, `It's O.K., I'll never see you again?''' Richardson wonders.
	   She may soon get her chance at a darker screen role, co-starring
with husband Liam Neeson in ``Asylum.'' She plays the adulterous
spouse of a mental institution doctor who has an affair with a
wife-killing patient played by Neeson.
	   ``I've had the opportunity on stage to play some incredible
women,'' she said. ``But I feel I haven't had that part on film
yet. I hope this is the part.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NASHVILLE, Tenness (AP) _ Instead of hip-swiveling Billy Ray
Cyrus making ``Achy Breaky Heart'' a country dance anthem, imagine
if the former gospel quartet the Oak Ridge Boys had recorded the
song.
	   The group, which crossed over to country stardom in the late
1970s, was offered the tune several years before Cyrus turned it
into a monster hit in 1992.
	   They passed.
	   ``It's one of the few times we kind of tanked,'' said group
member Joe Bonsall in the Aug. 4 issue of Country Weekly magazine.
	   ``Duane Allen, our lead vocalist, said that he didn't like the
words `achy breaky.' Duane still shakes his head about that one
today.''
	   The Oak Ridge Boys, also featuring Richard Sterban and William
Lee Golden, peaked with the 1981 hit ``Elvira.'' Their list of 17
No. 1 hits also includes ``Bobbie Sue'' and ``American Made.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Lack of experience was just what Dominique
Swain needed to play the title role in ``Lolita.''
	   Director Adrian Lyne picked her over 2,500 other candidates to
be the 12-year-old object of desire in the new movie version of
Vladimir Nabokov's novel.
	   At the time, Swain was just 14 and her acting work was limited
to school plays.
	   ``I think Adrian was very glad that I didn't have star
staidness,'' Swain says in Sunday's Orange County Register. ``He
said he liked my spontaneity. ... I definitely understand Lolita.
Lolita just wanted love.''
	   Swain, now a 17-year-old high school senior in Malibu, got the
part after sending Lyne a videotape of herself reading a passage
from the novel. Her co-star is Academy Award-winner Jeremy Irons.
He plays Humbert Humbert, the middle-aged man who becomes
infatuated with Lolita.
	   Because of its subject matter, the film failed to land a U.S.
distributor. It can be seen Aug. 2 on Showtime cable TV.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The prestigious La Scala opera company of
Italy staged a one-night performance in Beirut on Sunday to
celebrate the restoration of peace to Lebanon.
	   The 180 musicians and singers of the Milan-based La Scala
arrived only a few hours before they were due to perform at the
Forum de Beyrouth, a hall in the Karantina district that witnessed
some of the most savage fighting of the 1975-90 civil war.
	   Italian Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni flew in especially
for the event, which was attended by President Elias Hrawi and a
packed audience of 6,000. The show was broadcast live on
television.
	   Conductor Riccardo Muti staged an entirely Italian program of
extracts from the operas of Bellini, Rossini, Verdi and Puccini.
	   Muti told reporters before the show that he had ``realized a
dream'' by performing in Lebanon after peace had returned to the
country. La Scala liked to perform in countries that were
recovering from war, as it had done in Sarajevo, the Bosnian
capital, last year.
	   The performance was subsidized by the Italian government and the
Ravenna Festival foundation. Ticket prices ranged between dlrs 25
and dlrs 100.
	   Since the end of the war, Lebanon has hosted a number of
international performers, such as Jose Carreras, Julio Iglesias,
Paul Anka, Shirley Bassey and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovitch.

Irwin wins U.S. Senior Open with birdie on No. 18
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Hale Irwin opened the U.S. Senior Open with
his worst round of the year. By the time the tournament ended
Sunday, that 77 hadn't kept him from winning it.
	   Irwin made birdie putts on the 16th and 18th holes to complete a
round of 2-under-par 69 Sunday, giving him a one-shot victory over
Vicente Fernandez of Argentina, who finished with a 68.
	   Raymond Floyd, who led following each of the first three rounds,
was alone in third place at 287 after closing with a 74.
	   ``Of all the tournaments on the Senior Tour, this is the one I
wanted the most,'' said Irwin, whose birdie putts were from about
20 feet on the par-3 16th hole and 15 feet on the par-4 18th.
	   He also just missed a 20-footer (6 meters) for birdie on No. 17,
settling instead for a par.
	   ``I'll not want to forget this for a long time,'' Irwin said.
``I tasted victory here in 1976 (in the Los Angeles Open), this is
even better. I'm real proud of it, this is a highlight of my
career.''
	   Irwin, who has dominated the Senior Tour since 1996, became the
seventh player ever to win the U.S. Open and U.S. Senior Open
tournaments, and set a Senior Tour record for poorest first round
by a winner.
	   Irwin's 72-hole total of 285 on rounds of 77-68-71-69 was
1-over-par on the rugged 6,906-yard (6300-meters), par-71 Riviera
Country Club.
	   It didn't seem Irwin would be a factor after his horrendous
first round _ two shots higher than his previous worst round of the
year.
	   But he got back into contention with a 68 on Friday, and chipped
in from off the green on the 18th hole Saturday, putting him into
position to win for the fifth time this year.
	   ``The only thing I really felt was I wasn't out of it,'' he said
about his first-round score. ``The 77 certainly put a big bump in
the road.''
	   But not too big for Irwin, who earned dlrs 267,500 from a purse
of dlrs 1.5 million to boost his 1998 earnings to dlrs 2,002,750.
He has finished no worse than a tie for fifth in 14 senior
tournaments this year.
	   Irwin, 53, led all seniors in earnings two years ago at dlrs
1,615,769, and was first again last year at dlrs 2,343,364 _ a
record for seniors and more than anyone on the PGA or LPGA tours.
	   Fernandez, 52, was trying to win his first major of any kind and
was the leader in the clubhouse before Irwin's two late birdies.
	   Fernandez, who entered the Senior Open ranked ninth on the
earnings list, finished at 73-71-74-68_286, and earned dlrs 157,500
to increase his 1998 bankroll to dlrs 730,797.
	   Floyd, 55, took a three-shot lead over Irwin into the final
round, but it disintegrated over the first seven holes.
	   Floyd and Irwin, playing in the final twosome, both birdied the
first hole, but Floyd bogeyed the third and fifth holes, and Irwin
birdied the seventh to draw even.
	   Both players bogeyed the 10th hole, and suddenly, Fernandez,
playing four groups ahead of Floyd and Irwin, was just one shot
behind.
	   Fernandez erased the deficit by sinking a 10-foot (9-meter) putt
for birdie on the 16th hole, and became the undisputed leader when
Irwin and Floyd both bogeyed No. 13.
	   A few minutes later, Fernandez maintained his advantage by
knocking in a 15-foot putt on the 17th hole to save par, and then
parred No. 18.
	   He had the lead, but it wouldn't stand up.
	   Fernandez said he was behind the television tower near the 18th
green and didn't see Irwin's winning putt.
	   ``I had the feeling he was going to hole it,'' Fernandez said.
	   Floyd earned dlrs 101,537 for his third-place finish.
	   Brian Barnes, who finished with a 69, and Isao Aoki, who closed
with a 72, tied for fourth place at 288.
	   Dave Stockton was next at 289 after carding a 73, and Gil
Morgan, Dan Wood, Jose Maria Canizares, Ed Dougherty and Hugh
Baiocchi all finished at 290.
	   Barnes could have had an even better score. He incurred a
two-stroke penalty on the 11th green for playing his ball from the
wrong place.
	   Officials said Barnes marked his ball ``over'' one putter-head
length and failed to replace his ball before putting out. So
instead of an even-par 5 on the hole, he had to take a 7.
	   ``It was plain stupidity,'' said Barnes, who said he remained
angry at himself throughout the remainder of his round.
	   Jack Nicklaus, who shot himself out of contention Saturday with
a 79 _ his worst round ever as a senior _ rebounded dramatically
with a 4-under-par 67 in the final round. It was the best round of
the tournament.
	   ``Yesterday was obviously not a source of pride,'' Nicklaus said
with a chuckle. ``I had a blast today, that was fun. It's always
fun to play well.''
	   Nicklaus finished at 292 _ eight-over-par.

Hakkinen captures fifth race of the season in Austrian GP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPIELBERG, Austria (AP) _ The Flying Finn used a flying start to
capture his fifth Formula One race of the season and pull away from
Michael Schumacher.
	   By winning a chaotic Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday, Mika
Hakkinen opened an eight-point lead over Schumacher in the Formula
One championship. Schumacher finished third, but did well to move
from the back after damaging his car.
	   ``It was an excellent victory,'' said the McLaren-Mercedes
driver.
	   ``The team played a very important part in this race with their
tactics. The one-stop strategy was ideal for me. I was able to
charge and go flat out. I didn't have any problems,'' the Finn
said.
	   With six races left in the season, Hakkinen is far from secure.
But Schumacher had come into the race with the momentum of three
straight victories and was closing in on Hakkinen, whose once big
lead was down to two points.
	   Schumacher did not give up without a magnificent battle.
	   He and Hakkinen had started from the second row and both blasted
past pole leader Giancarlo Fisichella and Jean Alesi. It was
Hakkinen, however, who was in the lead at the first corner.
	   A number of accidents brought out the safety car before the
first lap was over.
	   Once it was gone, Schumacher tried twice to overtake Hakkinen
but the Finn stayed ahead. Schumacher lost the second place briefly
when he braked too late coming into a curve in the first attempt to
overtake, but quickly regained the second spot from Fisichella.
	   There was more trouble for the German on lap 18, when he swerved
out in a corner, hit the gravel hard and lost the nose cone of his
Ferrari.
	   ``It was a stupid mistake, I went off the line and hit the dust,
there was nothing I could do,'' Schumacher said.
	   ``There was less damage than I thought but there was enough
damage,'' the German said. ``This was an extraordinary race.
Considering what happened to me, I am extremely satisfied.''
	   In a race filled with accidents, Fisichella and Alesi went out
on lap 22, after Fisichella's Benetton had bumped into the
Frenchman's Sauber following a pit stop.
	   David Coulthard of Britain finished second to confirm McLaren's
exit from a slump.
	   After winning the first five of the season's six races, the
McLaren team has watched Schumacher give Ferrari three straight
wins.
	   Coulthard was one of the victims of the early crashes and also
had to fight his way through from the back of the field after
making a pit stop for quick repairs.
	   ``It's quite easy to pass when you have a quick car,'' Coulthard
said.
	   Hakkinen and Coulthard have now finished 1-2 four times this
season.
	   Eddie Irvine of Ireland finished fourth, after slowing down in
the last few laps and being overtaken by Schumacher with three laps
to go. Both drivers blamed brake problems and rejected suggestions
Irvine had helped Schumacher finish higher.
	   Hakkinen covered the 71 laps, or 306.649 kilometers (190.543
miles), in one hour, 30 minutes, 44.086 seconds, averaging a speed
of 202.777 kph (121.666 mph). Coulthard was 5.289 seconds behind,
and Schumacher 39.093.
	   By picking up 10 points for his victory, Hakkinen now has 66
points. Schumacher got four points and has a total of 58. Coulthard
remains third with 36.

Chinese gymnast unlikely to walk again, physician says

<TEXT>
	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ For an athlete who spent her
childhood perfecting vaults, flips and twirling dismounts, a
mundane feat like sitting up in bed shouldn't be a big deal for
Chinese gymnast Sang Lan.
	   But that simple act became a major event Sunday for Sang,
paralyzed since she fell on her head last week during practice at
the Goodwill Games.
	   Sang's modest progress followed a seven-hour spinal operation to
stabilize her neck Saturday. Although her doctors called the
procedure a success, they still said it's unlikely the 17-year-old
will walk again.
	   ``There are just so many different nerve connections that have
to heal,'' Dr. Vincent Leone told a news conference at the Nassau
County Medical Center in Long Island.
	   Since the surgery, Sang has gained strength in her shoulders and
biceps, but there has been no improvement in mobility in her hands,
wrists and legs, said Leone, the hospital's director of spinal
surgery.
	   Given the complexity of the injury and the healing process, it
was too soon to say how quickly the gymnast would recover and what
her final prognosis will be, Leone said.
	   Using a yellow rubber model of the spine, Leone explained the
goal of Saturday's surgery was to stabilize Sang's spine by
screwing three titanium plates into the section of the neck injured
in the fall.
	   ``The implants basically prevent her head from falling off her
shoulders,'' Leone said.
	   Surgeons also removed broken bone fragments and used bits of
bone from her left hip to fuse together vertebrae.
	   Sang is also being treated with an experimental nerve drug that
doctors said was her only hope of walking again. It was too early
to say if the drug, which provides the building blocks for nerves
to repair themselves, was working, Leone said.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, was chosen for
national team training when she was 11. Since then, her parents had
seen her only three times in China, most recently in October, as
their only daughter trained 740 miles (1,190 kilometers) from home
in Beijing.
	   Hours after her operation, Sang's parents arrived in New York
and were driven from Kennedy Airport to the hospital. The couple,
who did not speak to reporters, plan to give a news conference in
the next several days, hospital spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg said.
	   Sang will have to stay at the hospital for at least a week under
observation, and her parents have not decided whether to continue
treatment for their only child here or move her back home.
	   Before her parents left China, Sang's saddened friends made
1,000 birds for the couple to take with them _ symbols of their
wishes for a quick recovery.
	   Physicians and others who visited Sang on Sunday said that she
was in high spirits.
	   ``This young lady did not stop talking,'' said Nassau County
Executive Thomas S. Gulotta. ``Her spirit was uplifting, you had to
be encouraged to be in her presence.''
	   Gulotta said Sang asked to watch the Goodwill Games on Sunday
night and the hospital would arrange a special TV feed for her.
	   Goodwill Games spokesman Michael Lewellen reiterated an earlier
pledge by the event's sponsor, Turner Sports, and its parent
company, Time-Warner Inc., to provide all possible resources to
secure the family's future.
	   Lewellen said details had yet to be finalized.
	   ``The family has only been here for a few hours,'' he said.
``They haven't had the opportunity to state their wishes.''

Switzerland reaches landmark final on Hingis win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ Led by world No. 1 Martina Hingis,
Switzerland completed a three year climb out of the tennis minor
leagues on Sunday, booking a place in their first ever Fed Cup
final with a 5-0 demolition of defending champions France.
	   When Hingis joined the squad in 1995 the Swiss were languishing
in the third division of Fed Cup play. Now, three years later, the
team is on the brink of a landmark title.
	   ``As the world No. 1 you are always expected to be a key player
in the Fed Cup, and help the team advance,'' said Hingis, the
winner of four Grand Slams. ``With me as number one and Patty doing
so well this year we have a really good chance at the finals.''
	   Though it marks the team's first time in the world group since
1994, it was no surprise to see Switzerland march through to the
finals unencumbered.
	   Billing the world No. 1 and the emerging Patty Schnyder _ the
only women's player to win five tournaments this season _
Switzerland has been a favorite since the beginning of its Fed Cup
campaign.
	   Despite being excluded from the world's elite four years ago,
the small alpine nation has resurged with admirable speed, winning
every one of its ties since 1996.
	   In 1995 Melanie Molitor and her then-14-year-old daughter Hingis
joined the team. Under Molitor's guidance, Switzerland climbed out
of the European qualifying group a year later.
	   Last year, both Hingis and Schnyder joined forces to elevate the
nation into the world group by winning over Argentina in Zurich.
	   Continuing with their steamroller approach, Switzerland
flattened the Czech Republic 4-1 in April in Brno for their place
in the semifinals against holders France.
	   Switzerland delivered a sweeping blow to coach Yannick Noah's
squad, with Hingis' 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-2 victory over Mauresmo
giving her team the decisive 3-0 lead.
	   Switzerland will face either the United States or Spain in the
finals on Schnyder territory in Basel on September 19-20.
	   It was Hingis, playing competitively for the first time since
her semifinal loss at Wimbledon, who led the onslaught against the
French, dispatching Julie Halard-Decugis in straight sets to give
Switzerland a 1-0 lead.
	   After Schnyder's difficult victory over Mauresmo, it was Hingis'
turn to struggle against the French player.
	   Under the broiling sun, the Swiss labored throughout the match,
and the tension between Hingis and Molitor during change-overs was
obvious, Hingis even tossing a towel into her mother's face.
	   But the desire to do well before her public, along with her
experience, saw her through: After 2 hours, 19 minutes of intense
effort, the 17-year-old offered the landmark victory to the 8,000
cowbell-ringing spectators.
	   ``The public was so helpful, it was thanks to them it was
possible for me to come back,'' said Hingis, who at one point was
trailing 6-7, 4-1. ``Their support kept me going. It was incredible
how they made me feel out there.''
	   Schnyder, fresh off back-to-back titles, handed Switzerland the
sweep, defeating Julie Halard-Decugis 6-3, 6-2 in a dead rubber
before pairing up with Emmanuelle Gagliardi to defeat Nathalie
Tauziat and Alexandra Fusai 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 in a playful doubles
match.

Ullrich ready for the mountains

	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ Jan Ullrich says he is ready for the
mountains. If he comes out of the Alps the same way he came out of
the Pyrenees _ wearing the leader's yellow jersey _ chances of him
wearing it all the way to Paris would be virtually certain.
	   Monday's 189-kilometer (118-mile) stage to Les Deux Alpes
features four major climbs, and Ullrich is counting on his
teammates to help him.
	   ``The spirit on the Telekom team is optimal and physically the
team is at 100 percent,'' Ullrich said. ``There are people who I
have worked for and I know they will work for me now.''
	   His German Telekom teammates know how to defend the yellow
jersey. In 1996 Bjarne Riis won with Ullrich second. Last year was
Ullrich's turn. Now Riis rides to help Ullrich.
	   Ullrich is 71 seconds ahead of Bobby Julich of the United States
_ who has promised his best in the Alps. There are three days of
climbs before the Tour heads to a time trial on Saturday Aug. 1,
the day before the traditional finish on the Champs Ulysses.
	   The Tour de France returned to the traditional business of
racing Sunday, moving ahead of the drug scandal and the riders'
protests.
	   Stuart O'Grady of Australia used his sprinting ability to
capture the stage.
	   ``Every dog has his day and I've had a good couple of weeks,''
O'Grady said. He had the overall lead for three days during the
first week of the Tour and now adds his name to stage winners.
	   Orlando Rodrigues of Portugal was second with Leon Van Bon of
the Netherlands third.
	   Denmark's Peter Meinert-Nielsen came in fourth, the second
straight top-five finish for a member of the U.S. Postal team.
	   Laurent Desbiens, another former overall leader, was fifth.
Giuseppe Calcaterra of Italy, who was originally second, was
dropped to sixth for failing to keep a straight line in the final
sprint with O'Grady.
	   The top six finished 10 minutes ahead of the main pack.
	   The 187-kilometer (116-mile stage) from Valreas to Grenoble was
the last before the Alps. With temperatures at 30 C (86 F) the
favorites conserved their strength.
	   Ullrich came in 37th on the day without losing any time to his
major rivals. The biggest jump came from Meinert-Nielsen, who moved
to 49th in the overall standings, still 28 minutes behind Ullrich.
	   As much as three days in the Alps looms ahead for the cyclists,
there are also more drug problems ahead.
	   During the weekend, the director and doctor of the Dutch team
TVM were jailed. They are expected to be brought to Reims for
questioning concerning drugs found in the car of one of the team
officials in March.
	   Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc has said he will expel the TVM
team, as he did the Festina team, if there is evidence or
acknowledgment of drug use by the team.
	   Three Festina officials, including the director and team doctor,
were jailed on drug charges.

Agassi becomes four-time winner at Legg Mason Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with quotes.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Andre Agassi won a record fourth Legg Mason
Tennis Classic title Sunday, needing just 50 minutes _ the fastest
final match on the ATP Tour this year _ to defeat Scott Draper
Australia of 6-2, 6-0.
	   The second-seed Agassi, scheduled to play in Los Angeles this
week, has his sights set on the last Grand Slam of the year _ the
U.S. Open starting Aug. 31.
	   ``If I'm playing like this, I feel like I can win this U.S.
Open,'' Agassi said. ``There's no question in my mind it's in my
wheelhouse.''
	   Agassi, 28, didn't lose a set this week and is playing his best
tennis since 1995 when he was the world's top-ranked player.
	   ``I played him when he was No. 1 in the world and he played
better today,'' the 14th-seeded Draper said.
	   Agassi finished out of the top 100 last year for the first time
since turning pro in 1986. His ranking sank as low as No. 141, but
Agassi climbed back into the top 20 with tour victories in San Jose
and Scottsdale this year.
	   He rose to a season-high No. 13 after Sunday's victory.
	   ``It's time to step my game up to the next level. It's starting
to happen,'' Agassi said.
	   Drapper was trying to become the first Australian to win in
Washington since Tony Roche in 1972, some two years before Draper
was born.
	   While Sunday was Agassi's 52nd career final _ and 37th title _
Draper was in just his third.
	   ``I tried to outsmart him and in turn outsmarted myself,'' said
Draper, who advanced to the finals after top-seed Michael Chang
pulled out of the semifinals with a wrist injury.
	   Draper started out strongly and the first set was tied 2-2
before Agassi took over.
	   Agassi got triple-break point on Draper with a couple of
overhead smashes and a drop shot. Draper then buried a forehand
into the net for the break.
	   It was just the first of many unforced errors the rest of the
match for Draper and the beginning of 10 straight games won by
Agassi.
	   Draper's service faltered and he was able to get in only 39
percent of his first serves, compared to Agassi's 72 percent.
	   Agassi had everything working from forehand flicks down the line
to backhand crosscourt winners to aces that peaked at 123 mph.
	   ``When I'm playing well I have a versatility of shots on both
wings,'' Agassi said.
	   By the time the second set started, Agassi was rolling, winning
13 of the first 15 points and wrapping up the set in less than 20
minutes.
	   Draper was reduced to doffing his cap to crowd when he won a
rare point.
	   Sunday's quick match was typical of Agassi's Washington week.
His average match time was 59 minutes and he was broken once all
week, holding 40 of 41 service games.
	   Agassi collected $95,000 while Draper earned $49,750.
	   The South African team of Grant Stafford and Kevin Ullyett
dropped top seeds Wayne Ferriera and Patrick Galbraith in the
doubles final, 6-2, 6-4.

Obuchi reportedly wants ex-premier Miyazawa for finance minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ New ruling party president Keizo Obuchi may ask
former premier Kiichi Miyazawa to serve as finance minister in a
new Cabinet expected to be announced later this week, news reports
said Monday.
	   Miyazawa's participation was seen as necessary to help Japan
overcome an ``unprecedented'' economic crisis, reported the mass
circulation Yomiuri newspaper. The paper, Japan's largest, did not
name its sources, identifying them only as top officals in the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
	   Obuchi, who was elected president of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party on Friday, is expected to be formally voted into
office as prime minister Thursday.
	   The widely respected Miyazawa _ who according to the reports
would also be deputy prime minister _ is known as an expert on
financial affairs.
	   Before serving as prime minister from 1991-1993, he served in
various top Cabinet positions, including foreign minister and
finance minister. Before entering politics, he worked as a
bureaucrat in the Finance Ministry.
	   Obuchi will succeed fellow LDP member Ryutaro Hashimoto, who
announced earlier this month his intention to step down.
	   Hashimoto tendered his resignation after the LDP suffered a
humiliating defeat in July 12 elections for the upper house of
Parliament as voters vented their anger about the declining
fortunes of Japan's recession-bound economy.

Spain downs United States 3-2 to reach Fed Cup final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain knocked the United States out of the
Federation Cup semifinals Sunday when Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and
Conchita Martinez beat Lisa Raymond and Mary Joe Fernandez 6-4, 6-7
(5-7), 11-9 in doubles for a 3-2 victory.
	   The match lasted 3 hours, 40 minutes and finished under
floodlights before a boisterous home crowd waving red and yellow
Spanish flags.
	   The victory was revenge for Spain following its 5-0 drubbing by
the United States the last time they met in the Fed Cup in 1966.
	   Spain will play Switzerland for the title in September. The
Swiss beat France 5-0.
	   In the first match of the day, Monica Seles crushed Sanchez
Vicario 6-4, 6-0 to give the United States a 2-1 lead. Saturday's
play had ended in a 1-1 draw.
	   Martinez, ranked seventh in the world, averted her team's defeat
by downing Raymond 7-6 (7-1), 6-4.
	   Seles, ranked fifth in the world, dominated her first rematch
with No. 4 Sanchez Vicario since the latter beat her to take the
French Open last month.
	   Sanchez Vicario showed her trademark skill in chasing down just
about everything, but had trouble holding service. After holding
serve to go 2-2 in the first set, she did not manage to do so again
for the rest of the match.
	   In the other singles match, Raymond was serving for the first
set at 5-4 but failed to hold service. It went to a tiebreaker in
which she was swamped 7-1.
	   In the second set, down 2-4, she fought back to 4-4. But in the
last two games she failed to win a single point.
	   Spain is a powerhouse in Fed Cup play, winning the title four
times between 1991 and 1995.
 &UR; Switzerland 5, France 0
	   In Sion, Switzerland, Martina Hingis labored before beating
Amelie Mairesmo and clinching Switzerland's first appearance in the
final. The 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-2 victory by Hingis gave the Swiss an
unbeatable 3-0 lead over defending champion France.
	   Patty Schnyder, the only player to win five tournaments this
year, then completed the 5-0 Swiss sweep, defeating Julie
Halard-Decugis 6-3, 6-2 before pairing up with Emmanuelle Gagliardi
to beat Alexandra Fusai and Nathalie Tauziat 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the
doubles.
	   ``It was very tough,'' Hingis said of her match against
Mauresmo. ``Amelie played a tough match.''
	   The tension between Hingis and her mother, Melanie Molitor, who
also was the Swiss team captain, during changeovers was clearly
visible, the teenager even flinging a towel back into her mother's
face.
	   Hingis trailed 7-6 (8-6) 4-1 before raising her game to the
level that has made her No. 1 in the world.
	   ``I was suprised by the way she played,'' Hingis said of her
French opponent. ``I used to wonder with what she beat the other
girls. Today, I found out.''
	   The contest marked the first time the two nations met since 1964
when France triumphed 3-0. It is also Switzerland's first time in
the world group since 1994.
	   In qualifying for next year's Fed Cup World Group I, Russia beat
Germany 4-1, Slovakia downed Belgium 4-1, Croatia edged the
Netherlands 3-2 and Italy downed the Czech Republic 4-1.

	   LONDON (AP) _ In the latest move to expand its reach, AT and T
is forming a joint venture with British Telecommunications that
will combine their international operations and develop a new
Internet-type of network.
	   The tie-up, announced at a news conference Sunday, follows the
failure ot an earlier plan by BT to acquire MCI Communications
Corp., the No. 2 U.S. carrier behind AT and T. BT was outbid by
rival WorldCom Inc.
	   ``The merging of our international assets to form this global
venture will enable BT and AT and T to deliver in a unique and
powerful way the seamless global services our multinational
customers need and want,'' AT and T's president, John D. Zeglis,
told reporters.
	   The new company, which has yet to be named, is expected to have
revenues of dlrs 10 billion a year and employ some 5,000 people. It
will be based in the eastern United States and will be run by
executives from both BT and AT and T. The BT chairman, Sir Iain
Vallance, will be its first chairman.
	   After losing its deal with MCI, BT went straight to the top of
the U.S. market in cutting a deal with AT and T, which has been
expanding agressively since chairman C. Michael Armstrong took over
last year.
	   AT and T agreed in June to a dlrs 32 billion merger with U.S.
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., and just last week closed a
dlrs 11.3 billion takeover of Teleport Communications Group.
	   In order to join forces with BT, AT and T will leave two other
international deals: The AT and T-Unisource alliance that has
Dutch, Swedish and Swiss partners, and its WorldPartners
arrangement, a loose alliance with other international
long-distance companies.
	   ``We've got the two greatest brands standing shoulder to
shoulder and we think we're going to transform the global
telecommunications industry,'' the BT chief executive, Sir Peter
Bonfield, told reporters.
	   The companies predicted 15 percent annual growth for the new
company after the first year of operations. Their goal, they said,
is to create jobs rather than eliminate them, although they
acknowledged a few overlapping jobs may be in trouble as the deal
comes together.
	   The companies will use their combined international networks to
become a ``carrier's carrier'' for long-distance services offered
by telephone companies operating in numerous markets. BT and AT and
T said that 90 percent of the global telephone market will soon be
open to significant competition, and they want to woo business from
startup phone companies in numerous markets.
	   They will not hold stock in one another, however, and have no
plans to bring other companies in as partners in the joint venture.
	   BT and AT and T said they will be able to ``provide an
outstanding range of global services, far greater than either BT or
AT and T could provide alone or with their current alliances.''
	   The companies said their new Internet operation will be a global
system ``unparalleled in capability and reach,'' facilitating
international electronic commerce and communications and serving as
a host for Web sites.
	   The venture will operate in three main areas:
	   _A worldwide voice and data business that offers telephone
networks to multinational corporations and other big instituations.
	   _A global sales and service business that initially will target
corporate clients in the financial, oil and information technology
businesses.
	   _An international carrier services business that will develop
low-cost communications links around the world for both individual
and business customers.
	   In a related development, BT and AT and T also will invest dlrs
1 billion, on a 50-50 basis, in U.S. businesses involved in high
technology and ``emerging communications markets.''
	   BT's agreement to purchase MCI for dlrs 24 billion was outdone
by a dlrs 37 billion offer from WorldCom. The new deal will be
bigger internationally for BT, but unlike the arrangement with MCI,
it will not make BT a player in the domestic U.S. telephone market.
	   BT already has a global partnership with MCI, called Concert,
that BT plans to buy out as WorldCom buys MCI. AT and T will begin
selling Concert services in the United States under the name AT and
T Concert as the bigger deal with BT undergoes regulatory scrutiny.
	   Although the companies will need approval from regulators in the
United States, Britain and the European Union, they predicted they
can close on the deal within one year.

Britain's National Health Service at 50: Can it survive?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic BRITAIN NHS &QL; 
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It was the early hours of July 5, 1948, and Doris
White was rejoicing over the birth of her daughter. But she had an
extra reason to celebrate: Thanks to Britain's brand new
free-to-all national health system, her hospital stay would cost
her nothing.
	   ``My mother is very fond of telling me how, during her labor,
she drove all the nurses mad by asking what the time was,'' says
her daughter, Susan Sewell. ``When it got to midnight, she stopped
asking, because she knew that the National Health Service was born
and her hospital stay would be free.''
	   In the 50 years since, the national health service has cared for
millions of Britons from cradle to grave, providing most treatment
without direct charge.
	   But as the NHS enters middle age, the question looms: Can an
already overloaded system funded almost solely by taxes continue to
cater to a population with growing expectations and longer
lifespans, in a world where expensive new treatments appear almost
daily?
	   With the number of taxpayers steady at about 25 million and the
proportion of elderly in the population of 60 million creeping
steadily upward, spending and services lag demand. There are now
almost 1.2 million patients waiting for non-urgent hospital
treatment, such as hip replacements and cataract operations.
	   Many hospitals and clinics are dilapidated, and the number of
available beds has declined from 550,000 in the 1960s to around
200,000 today.
	   The service has suffered a series of embarrassing failures, such
as a scandal at the Royal Bristol Infirmary, where surgeons
continued to perform heart operations on babies despite warnings
that death rates were unusually high.
	   On July 14, the government announced it will inject an extra 21
billion pounds (dlrs 34 billion) into the NHS over the next three
years, much of it for new technology and equipment and for new
buildings. Some of the money will come from the sale of government
assets, but most will be provided by taxpayers.
	   Health Secretary Frank Dobson pledged to ``improve and modernize
the NHS to make it fit for the 21st century.''
	   Rudolf Klein, professor of social policy at Bath University, and
some other experts contend the system must be reorganized because
it is over-centralized.
	   The government's own audits show ``many of the NHS's financial
ills are self-inflicted. Resources are often used inefficiently and
ineffectively,'' Klein said.
	   Government officials reject the idea of pushing responsibility
down to local or regional authorities.
	   On the plus side, Britons can summon their doctors, free of
charge, around the clock for emergency consultations and check out
of hospitals without having to settle hefty bills.
	   Life expectancy is up: A boy born in an NHS hospital today is
expected to live an average of 75 years, compared with 66 years for
a boy born before 1948.
	   The NHS, which dispenses 1.7 million prescriptions a day, has
done pioneering work in hip replacements, the use of ultrasound and
in-vitro fertilization techniques.
	   A recent Gallup poll said 89 percent of Britons consider the
service a success, with 91 percent of those who had used it in the
past three months satisfied with their treatment. Gallup questioned
1,006 voters by phone June 25-July 1, with a margin of error of 3
percentage points.
	   ``Yes, the NHS has its problems,'' said Julian Le Grand, a
professor of social policy at the London School of Economics. ``But
it is the least worst of all health systems. It costs relatively
little, produces a reasonable quality of health care and its health
outcomes are not bad.
	   ``Male life expectancy here is higher than in both the United
States, which spends 14 percent of its gross national product on
health, and in Germany, which spends 10 percent,'' Le Grand said.
	   Britain puts 7 percent of GNP into health care.
	   Aneurin Bevan, health minister in the post-World War II Labor
Party government, launched the state-run service to provide medical
treatment ``free at the point of delivery.''
	   In 1948, most British hospitals were overcrowded, inefficient
and rundown. Historian Geoffrey Rivett notes, for example, that the
legs of beds in the maternity ward at London's Paddington general
hospital stood in tins of oil to stop cockroaches from crawling up.
	   Many hospitals were run by charities, or were grim municipal
infirmaries built in former workhouses. More than half Britain's
people had no medical insurance.
	   Early in 1948, every home in Britain received a leaflet
announcing that beginning that July 5, the new National Health
Service would ``provide you with all medical, dental and nursing
care.''
	   ``Everyone _ rich or poor, man, woman or child _ can use it or
any part of it,'' the leaflet promised.
	   Bevan bought up broke charity hospitals and won over doctors by
offering them decent pay and conditions.
	   Soon, lines formed at doctor and dentist offices and, in its
first nine months, the service spent tens of millions of dollars
more than expected. The government assumed it all was due to a
backlog _ but the lines grew steadily and the service continued to
gobble money.

LONDON: gobble money.

<TEXT>
	   Since the 1950s, the NHS has charged for dental work. A fee for
eye tests was introduced in 1989, although the government said
Tuesday that pensioners will now be exempt from this charge. Most
patients pay a standard charge of 5.80 pounds (dlrs 9.30) for each
prescription.
	   But the fees bring in only 2 percent of the NHS's annual budget,
which stands at 46 billion pounds (dlrs 74 billion).
	   Despite its cost, the NHS has remained in state hands, surviving
even Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's relentless privatization
drive in the 1980s.
	   Some experts have suggested the government encourage more people
to take out private health insurance, but Britons remain committed
to the NHS. Only 10 percent of Britons now have such insurance, a
proportion that has changed little since the mid-1980s. Most who
``go private'' cite the slowness in NHS treatment.
	   In an analysis of the NHS's state of health, John Willman of the
private Social Market Foundation suggested patients be required to
directly pay some of their medical costs. For instance, 10 pounds
(dlrs 16) for a doctor visit and 50 pounds (dlrs 80) a day for
hospital stays would raise an extra 5 billion pounds (dlrs 8
billion) a year, he said.
	   Sweden's health system gets 10 percent of its budget this way,
Willman said. But Britain's government has ruled out extra charges.
	   At a 50th anniversary ceremony, Dobson, the health secretary,
said the NHS succeeds because of ``the bargain that each of us
strikes with one another.''
	   ``While I'm doing well, I'll pay into the system,'' he added.
``... And I do so in the sure and certain knowledge that if I fall
ill, or have an accident, or get old, other people will pay in to
help me.''
	   So, Le Grand, the social policy professor, said, ``the system
will continue to muddle along, funded by taxes _ with lots of sound
and fury when things go wrong.''

	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Mount Athos, the largest community of monks
outside Tibet, has always evoked an air of mystery. Its solitude
and strict customs are far removed from the pace of modern Greece.
But, after a long decline, the all-male Christian Orthodox
peninsula is humming with new energy.
	   ___
 &UR; By THANASSIS CAMBANIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   MOUNT ATHOS, Greece (AP) _ The monks claim their mountain is
timeless and immune to the mundane cares of the world.
	   On first glance, it seems they're right. More than a millennium
after St. Athanasios founded the all-male monastic community of
Mount Athos, little has changed.
	   Women and even most female animals are banned.
	   Monks rise hours before dawn and begin a disciplined day of
prayer, labor and contemplation. Their diet is built around a
spartan offering of boiled vegetables and the occasional fish _
just like their predecessors centuries before.
	   But a new noise is rising above the Byzantine chants and ocean
winds: the sound of hammers, saws and chattering workmen.
	   For the hermits of the ``Holy Mountain,'' it's joyous music.
	   ___
	   The buzz of activity has not been seen for centuries on the
peninsula, a rocky finger poking into the northern Aegean Sea about
130 kilometers (80 miles) southeast of Salonica.
	   The hopes of the approximately 2,000 monks are rising along with
scaffolding and other stages of a vast construction effort mounted
to prevent the collapse of the 20 grand Christian Orthodox
monasteries in the semiautonomous enclave.
	   ``Thirty years ago, the population was plummeting. The
government was already making plans to hire caretakers, assuming
the monasteries would become uninhabited museums,'' said Father
Vasilios, abbot of Pantokratoros Monastery.
	   ``Some people wanted to see Mount Athos fall,'' he added.
	   That was literally the threat to another monastery,
Stavronikitas, perched atop a cliff 100 meters (330 feet) above the
sea. The rock foundation had worn away and cracks had split all
four main walls.
	   ``This place was a wreck ... The monastery was ready to unfold
like a flower and fall into the sea,'' said the abbot, Father
Toichonas.
	   At Stavronikitas, workers have pumped the bedrock full of cement
and anchored the monastery in place with 60-meter-long
(200-foot-long) steel cables.
	   ``They have brought new life to the Holy Mountain,'' said
Toichonas.
	   After the overthrow of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, Mount Athos
began a long period of decline. Funds dried up. With the fall of
the Russian czars in 1917, the last significant outside benefactor
disappeared.
	   Once a bustling center of 40,000 Orthodox monks, Athos started
falling apart. The population fell to 1,000. Abandoned wings of the
monasteries collapsed into disrepair.
	   The peninsula's obstinate independence _ a council of monks
decides local matters although a governor is appointed by Greece's
ministry of foreign affairs _ clashed with its material needs.
	   In the early 1990s, the monks turned down a European Union aid
package to reconstruct dilapidated monasteries, fearing that
outside money would erode their control. A continuing worry is that
the EU will try to force Athos to admit women on the grounds its
all-male status violates EU provisions on equal rights and free
travel for all.
	   Indeed, some EU officials, led by complaints from women
politicians, have declared 1998 the ``Year of Mount Athos'' to
focus attention on ending the men-only rule.
	   Despite snubbing the EU's aid proposal, the monks did accept a
1994 offer from the Greek government to provide Mount Athos with
dlrs 70 million over six years, with promises of more funds later.
	   Not all monks were pleased at extending a hand to the outside
world. ``Some here objected to accepting money from the Greek state
because they fear it will enslave us,'' said Vasilios, the
Pantokratoros abbot.

<TEXT>
	   ___
	   Visitors quickly realize Athos is a different world.
	   Cars bear special Holy Mountain license plates. There are no
modern buildings. The only inhabitants not wearing black robes are
the police officers and workmen stationed there.
	   The double-headed eagle _ the sign of the Byzantine empire _
flies on the flag outside every monastery and adorns everything
from door handles to chandeliers.
	   Church bells and deep chanting echo from the monasteries. Monks
try their best to ignore the estimated 350,000 visitors each year _
some tourists, some pilgrims.
	   An influx of young monastics in the past decade has doubled the
population of monks to about 2,000.
	   Suspicion of the outside world has abated to some degree.
	   After much deliberation, the monks agreed to exhibit many of
Athos' art treasures during Salonica's stint as European Cultural
Capital in 1997.
	   The exhibit, which drew more than 700,000 spectators, was the
first _ and perhaps only _ chance for women to view Athos'
artifacts such as gilded crosses and jewel-encrusted icons.
	   Much of the government aid money has gone to restoring the
monasteries' religious objects: icons up to 1,000 years old, relics
such the hand purported to be the Apostle Luke's, immense doors of
ivory inlay, bronze filigree chandeliers, ancient manuscripts.
	   The work is a restoration, not a revolution. The community still
retains most of its old ways. Athos uses the Julian calendar, which
is 13 days behind the rest of the world. The monks also divide each
day into 12 Byzantine hours of varying lengths, although
visitor-friendly monasteries hang an ``outside world'' clock next
to an Athos clock.
	   ___
	   A sense of peace and plenty _ and a new satisfaction _ pervades
the quiet peninsula. Each monk has a task, from keeping the library
to cultivating vegetables or honey to peeling potatoes.
	   The eight hours of required prayer and the hours of solitary
labor fit in with the monks' code of silence. A strict routine
regulates each day, and the monks say neither the flood of visitors
nor the flurry of construction can distract them.
	   ``The construction doesn't bother us,'' said Father Gabriel, the
gardener at Iviron Monastery, one of Athos' oldest. ``We live as
simply as possible.''
	   The advent of young, well-educated monks has added energy to the
monasteries, he said. ``Young people are beginning to express an
interest in spiritual things and in the life here,'' he said.
``More are interested in becoming monks than we are able to
accept.''

	   MOUNT ATHOS, Greece (AP) _ Up in the hills among the laurel and
thyme bushes, the monks of Simonopetra Monastery have tended
beehives for seven centuries.
	   Recently, they have been harvesting another bounty: the sun's
rays with solar panels.
	   The monks of Mount Athos' 20 monasteries are renowned for strict
adherence to tradition. But some are now on the cutting edge of
technology, borrowing useful elements of the outside world without
disrupting the centuries-old foundations of meditation and worship.
	   Cellular phones, cameras and jeeps are now common on Mount
Athos. A full-service bank opened last year.
	   At Simonopetra Monastery, the monks include lawyers, doctors and
engineers as able to discuss the complexities of the newest
computer chip or digital camera as they are to talk about the
nature of the soul.
	   Father Theodosius, director of Simonopetra's energy program,
holds a chemistry degree from his native Germany. He was drawn to
the meditation and spirituality of monastic life, but he sees it as
a haven for high intellectual pursuits.
	   His only complaint: ``The band width of our phone lines doesn't
allow us to connect to the Internet. But that will be fixed in
time.''
	   In the last three years, Theodosius has put together a power
plant for the monastery using solar and hydroelectric sources.
	   ``Right now we're producing a surplus of electricity,''
Theodosius said, sitting at his computer in an air-conditioned
office.
	   Simonopetra, founded in 1257, boasts several computers, a
temperature-controlled library and antiquity preservation wing,
several air-conditioned spaces and round-the-clock electricity.
	   Down the peninsula, monks at Aghiou Dionissiou monastery are
busy creating a digital archive of its 1,000 ancient handwritten
manuscripts.
	   Father Gabriel, a graduate of Athens Economic University, spends
several hours every day scanning manuscripts and processing the
computerized images.
	   ``When digital cameras become high quality enough, we'll be able
to put icons and more fragile manuscripts into the computer,''
Gabriel said with a big smile.
	   ``The monks who had problems with technology are gone from here
now,'' he added.
	   Eventually, scholars around the world will have access to the
files, perhaps via the Internet. But Gabriel said there's no hurry.
	   ``We've got all eternity.''

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) - Spain advanced to the Fed Cup finals Sunday
with a grueling late-night doubles win over the United States.
	   World No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and No. 7 Conchita Martinez,
both of whom had played singles matches earlier in the day,
defeated Lisa Raymond and Mary Joe Fernandez 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 11-9
over three hours and 40 minutes.
	   The overall team score in the semifinal match was 3-2. In the
finals September 19-20, Spain will face Switzerland, which defeated
defending champion France 5-0 this weekend.
	   Spain's win was sweet revenge for the 5-0 drubbing it suffered
at the hands of the Americans the last time they met, in the 1996
finals in Atlanta City.
	   Spain is a powerhouse in Fed Cup tennis, winning the
championship four times between 1991 and 1995. It lost in the
finals three other times.
	   Eager for another cup, the crowd at the Club de Campo outside
Madrid erupted in cheers and the Spaniards hugged each other at
center court after winning a third set that had seemed set to go on
forever. The match ended at 1:20 a.m. (2330 gmt) on Monday.
	   Sanchez Vicario said she and Martinez were so tired in the final
set that the game could have gone either way.
	   ``It was a flip of the coin,'' she said.
	   ``I don't know where we found the strength,'' Martinez added.
	   U.S. coach Billie Jean King called it ``unbelievable tennis''
all around. Her players did not meet with the press.
	   The Americans jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first set but
squandered it to go 4-5, then saw Sanchez Vicario ice the set with
a nice cross court volley.
	   In the second set the Americans again started strong, leading
4-1, but barely held on to win the tiebreaker 7-5.
	   The final set was hard fought from the outset, with Spain saving
four break points. Victory came on a drop shot from Sanchez Vicario
that Fernandez returned into the net.
	   In the first match of the day, Monica Seles crushed Sanchez
Vicario 6-4, 6-0 to give the United States a 2-1 lead. Saturday's
play had ended in a 1-1 draw.
	   It was the their first rematch since the Spaniard beat Seles to
take the French Open last month. Sunday's match lasted just 62
minutes.
	   Martinez later revived Spain's chances by defeating Raymond 7-6
(7-1) 6-4.
	   On Saturday, Raymond started off strong in her singles match
against Sanchez Vicario, taking the first set 7-6 (7-4) but the
Spaniard came roaring back to take the second and third sets 6-3
and 6-0.
	   In the other singles match Saturday, Seles downed Martinez 6-3,
3-6, 6-1.

New Japanese leader promises action to fix economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Fresh from victory at home, Japan's
incoming prime minister has promised anxious neighbors and the
United States that his top priorities are lifting Japan out of
recession and ``making a contribution to Asia.''
	   Keizo Obuchi told U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
that he will overcome his reputation for indecisiveness by
following through on a campaign pledge and have enacted a package
of a dlrs 43 billion tax cut and dlrs 71 billion in government
spending, U.S. officials said Sunday.
	   Asia's financial crisis tops the agenda for Monday's meeting of
the states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with the
United States and other countries. Another critical area of
concern: last May's nuclear explosions by India and Pakistan.
	   Although Albright has been pressuring Japan to do more, in
Sunday's meeting Obuchi ``laid out a fairly comprehensive agenda
and said he was going to move on it very quickly,'' a senior
administration official said, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity. ``In a sense, it wasn't really necessary for her to give
him a long laundry list.''
	   Obuchi, currently Japan's foreign minister, was elected Friday
to head the Liberal Democratic Party, all but assuring his
succession to the prime minister's position next week. He spent
much of Sunday touching base in Manila with leaders gathered for
the annual meeting of an ASEAN regional forum.
	   Foreign ministers of the ASEAN nations _ Philippines, Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar,
formerly Burma _ held a festive dinner Sunday night with their
outside colleagues.
	   Albright, who also met Sunday with the Philippine foreign
minister, Domingo Siazon, planned one-on-one meetings Monday with
the foreign ministers of China, Russia, Korea and India.
	   Obuchi's words on his economic plans were followed closely
because Southeast Asian nations look toward Japan, which has the
world's second-largest economy, to pull the region out of its
yearlong crisis.
	   U.S. officials fear worsening of Japan's economic situation
could aggravate the Asian crisis dramatically and increase its
impact on the U.S. economy as well.
	   On his flight from Tokyo Sunday, Obuchi told reporters he is
aware of Asian countries' worries about the state of Japan's
economy.
	   ``I want to communicate strongly my ideas for revitalizing the
domestic economy and making a contribution to Asia,'' he told
reporters on the plane.
	   Japan must ``expedite the implementation of its economic
measures in support of the economic recovery of ASEAN countries,''
the ASEAN ministers said in a communique Saturday.
	   The best thing Japan can do for economic recovery in ASEAN ``is
to get its own financial house in order,'' said Thai Foreign
Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul. ``The financial disease started
in Japan in 1991-92, and they never cured it. So it cropped up
somewhere else, like malaria. We were the manifestation of that
disease.''
	   Not all of the Japanese leader's meetings dealt with the
economy.
	   In a 25-minute chat at the Manila Hotel with Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the subject of the economy never came
up, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. Russia has
deep-seated financial troubles of its own.
	   Obuchi also met separately with the foreign ministers of China
and South Korea.
	   Members were keeping a watchful eye on elections in politically
turbulent Cambodia, held Sunday apparently without major trouble or
violence. Counting returns will take several days.

Communist faithful anticipate message of hope on Revolution Day

	   SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) _ As the sun set over the stone army
barracks where Fidel Castro launched his revolution 45 years ago
Sunday, thousands of communist faithful anticipated a message of
hope amid economic hardship as the Cuban leader took the podium.
	   ``In difficult moments, the people unite to support the
revolution,'' Manuel Valdez, 63, a retired soldier from this
eastern provincial city, said shortly before Castro took the stage.
``I am proud to be part of the revolution.''
	   Dressed in his trademark olive military fatigues but without his
billed cap, Castro started out with a lengthy history lesson about
Santiago, which was invaded by the U.S. military a century ago this
year _ and one of his traditional attacks on the U.S. government.
	   ``On April 19, 1898, the U.S. Congress adopted a joint
resolution declaring that the people of Cuba should be free and
independent. It was was a deceitful resolution,'' Castro said.
Spanish rule of Cuba ended when the Americans landed in 1898, but
the United States continued to control the Caribbean island until
1902.
	   ``It is good to remember these things,'' he said, his voice
breaking frequently as he started out, but growing stronger and
clearer as the speech wore on. He also called ``illegal'' the U.S.
military's continued presence at Guantanamo Bay, on the island's
eastern tip.
	   Some 10,000 people crowded into a clearing before the Moncada
barracks where Castro and his followers launched a disastrous
offensive against the Cuban army. Although the attackers were
repelled, and either killed or jailed, the offensive is seen as the
start of the revolution that triumphed 5 1/2 years later.
	   ``We defend socialism with unmovable firmness!'' the government
supporters chanted.
	   Earlier in the day, some of Castro's first followers returned to
Granjita Siboney, the farming village where they spent the night
before the 1953 attack on the Moncada barracks that began the
uprising, to tell schoolchildren about the battle and to urge them
not to lose faith in the revolution.
	   ``When we were your age we didn't have even a tenth of what you
now have,'' Pedro Gutierrez, 69, told the children. ``We feel very
proud to have put our grain of sand into defeating the dictatorship
and helping to bring us everything that we have today.''
	   The children craned their necks and listened attentively to the
men who have become national heroes.
	   ``After hearing their words we are more clear about what
happened on that day _ and about what has been happening since
then,'' 13-year-old Ramon Enrique Suarez said.
	   But these are troubled times in Cuba. A decades-old U.S.
economic embargo has taken a heavy toll, and most foreign aid dried
up almost a decade ago with the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
	   Although few people are starving, poverty is widespread and
begging and prostitution are common in the main cities.
	   But the old rebels have few regrets. ``Despite the blockade and
the economic crisis, people are living better than we were in
1953,'' Jose Luis Lopez Villa, 74, said.

Albanians say offensive an attempt by Milosevic to negotiate from

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed by tanks, Serb forces are
pressing their offensive in what Albanian leaders see as a move by
the government to bolster its position before more talks on the
future of Kosovo province.
	   Serb sources reported tough fighting Sunday in the rugged hills
of central and western Kosovo as police battled the Kosovo
Liberation Army for control of key roads linking the provincial
capital Pristina with major towns to the west and south.
	   The offensive _ the most widespread and coordinated Serb
operation since April _ appeared aimed at clearing KLA fighters
from three strategic highways: one westward from Pristina to Pec,
another south to the town of Prizren and a third along the Albanian
border in western Kosovo.
	   If successful, the operation would split the estimated one-third
of the province under rebel control and block routes to their
sanctuaries in neighboring Albania, from where the insurgents
smuggle weapons.
	   An Albanian political analyst, Behlul Beqaj, said, however, that
the offensive could prove costly for the government because the KLA
has traditionally been ``strongest when defending its positions.''
	   The KLA has so far refused appeals by the United States and
European powers to accept moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
to represent the ethnic Albanian community in more talks with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the future of the
province.
	   Albanians compromise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
The KLA opposes Rugova because he has renounced violence. Rugova's
League of Democratic Kosovo has appealed to the United States, the
European Union and other organizations to stop the government
offensive, which began late Friday.
	   Rugova's top aide, Fehmi Agani, told The Associated Press that
the offensive appears aimed at gaining a clear advantage on the
battlefield before peace talks, which the Americans and Europeans
are trying to broker.
	   ``Milosevic is trying in every way and at all costs to secure a
superior position before possible negotiations,'' Agani said. ``It
has always been his position to negotiate from a superior
position.''
	   Milosevic has offered to restore Kosovo's autonomy, which he
abolished in 1989, but he opposes independence. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   The Americans and Europeans also oppose independence, fearing it
will lead to greater demands by the ethnic Albanians to unite with
Albanian communities in other Balkan countries and destabilize the
entire region.
	   Early Sunday, the fighting spilled across the Albanian border,
with Yugoslav and Albanian officials reporting an exchange of fire.
Explosions and the rattle of automatic gunfire reverberated through
the hills west of Pristina, and smoke rose from red-roofed
villages. Both sides acknowledged casualties in the fighting.
	   But no reliable, independent casualty figures were available.
Nervous Serb police turned back reporters who tried to reach the
fighting.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said police drove KLA
fighters from the villages of Banja and Zociste, site of a Serbian
Orthodox monastery that the guerrillas had controlled since early
this month.
	   The Serbian Media Center said Sunday that two policemen have
been killed and another two were wounded in fighting south of
Pristina toward Prizren. Serb sources claimed 11 Albanians died in
fighting south of Pristina, while another 20 surrendered to
government forces in western Kosovo.
	   In its account, the Kosovo Information Center, run by Albanians,
reported ``at least'' 10 Serb policemen have died in the fighting.
The Albanians put KLA losses at one dead and one wounded.
	   The Albanian center also said eight Albanian civilians have been
killed and about 40 wounded during the latest Serb offensive.

	   LONDON (AP) _ In the latest move to expand its reach, AT and T
is forming a joint venture with British Telecommunications that
will combine their international operations and develop a new
Internet-type of network.
	   The tie-up, announced at a news conference Sunday, follows the
failure of an earlier plan by BT to acquire MCI Communications
Corp., the No. 2 U.S. carrier behind AT and T. BT was outbid by
rival WorldCom Inc.
	   ``The merging of our international assets to form this global
venture will enable BT and AT and T to deliver in a unique and
powerful way the seamless global services our multinational
customers need and want,'' AT and T's president, John D. Zeglis,
told reporters.
	   The new company, which has yet to be named, is expected to have
revenues of dlrs 10 billion a year and employ some 5,000 people. It
will be based in the eastern United States and will be run by
executives from both BT and AT and T. The BT chairman, Sir Iain
Vallance, will be its first chairman.
	   After losing its deal with MCI, BT went straight to the top of
the U.S. market in cutting a deal with AT and T, which has been
expanding aggressively since chairman C. Michael Armstrong took
over last year.
	   AT and T agreed in June to a dlrs 32 billion merger with U.S.
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., and just last week closed a
dlrs 11.3 billion takeover of Teleport Communications Group.
	   In order to join forces with BT, AT and T will leave two other
international deals: The AT and T-Unisource alliance that has
Dutch, Swedish and Swiss partners, and its WorldPartners
arrangement, a loose alliance with other international
long-distance companies.
	   ``We've got the two greatest brands standing shoulder to
shoulder and we think we're going to transform the global
telecommunications industry,'' the BT chief executive, Sir Peter
Bonfield, told reporters.
	   The companies predicted 15 percent annual growth for the new
company after the first year of operations. Their goal, they said,
is to create jobs rather than eliminate them, although they
acknowledged a few overlapping jobs may be in trouble as the deal
comes together.
	   The companies will use their combined international networks to
become a ``carrier's carrier'' for long-distance services offered
by telephone companies operating in numerous markets. BT and AT and
T said that 90 percent of the global telephone market will soon be
open to significant competition, and they want to woo business from
startup phone companies in numerous markets.
	   They will not hold stock in one another, however, and have no
plans to bring other companies in as partners in the joint venture.
	   BT and AT and T said they will be able to ``provide an
outstanding range of global services, far greater than either BT or
AT and T could provide alone or with their current alliances.''
	   The companies said their new Internet operation will be a global
system ``unparalleled in capability and reach,'' facilitating
international electronic commerce and communications and serving as
a host for Web sites.
	   The venture will operate in three main areas:
	   _A worldwide voice and data business that offers telephone
networks to multinational corporations and other big institutions.
	   _A global sales and service business that initially will target
corporate clients in the financial, oil and information technology
businesses.
	   _An international carrier services business that will develop
low-cost communications links around the world for both individual
and business customers.
	   In a related development, BT and AT and T also will invest dlrs
1 billion, on a 50-50 basis, in U.S. businesses involved in high
technology and ``emerging communications markets.''
	   BT's agreement to purchase MCI for dlrs 24 billion was outdone
by a dlrs 37 billion offer from WorldCom. The new deal will be
bigger internationally for BT, but unlike the arrangement with MCI,
it will not make BT a player in the domestic U.S. telephone market.
	   BT already has a global partnership with MCI, called Concert,
that BT plans to buy out as WorldCom buys MCI. AT and T will begin
selling Concert services in the United States under the name AT and
T Concert as the bigger deal with BT undergoes regulatory scrutiny.
	   Although the companies will need approval from regulators in the
United States, Britain and the European Union, they predicted they
can close on the deal within one year.

Dollar higher, Tokyo stocks fall in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Monday
as renewed concerns about the Asian financial crisis weighed on the
Japanese currency. Tokyo stock prices fell moderately.
	   The dollar bought 141.62 yen in early trading, up 1.08 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
141.44 yen on Friday.
	   Renewed worries emerged after Moody's Investors Service, a U.S.
credit rating agency, on Friday downgraded Malaysia's sovereign
debt ratings, although it still kept the nation at investment-grade
status.
	   But some currency traders were retreating to the sidelines to
await the formation of a new Japanese Cabinet expected later this
week.
	   Keizo Obuchi, elected Friday to head the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party in place of resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, is expected to be chosen premier by Parliament on
Thursday.
	   Hashimoto announced he would resign after his ruling LDP
suffered a devastating setback in July 12 elections for the upper
house of Parliament.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices started lower as the
yen's renewed weakness against the dollar dampened sentiment amid
light trading.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 105.15 points, or 0.64
percent, to 16,256.74 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Friday, the average closed up 173.88 points, or 1.07 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 4.45 points, or 0.35 percent, 1,253.56. The
TOPIX closed up 8.14 points, or 0.65 percent, on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.350 percent from Friday's finish of 1.370 percent,
driving its price up to 110.74 yen from 110.68 yen.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A conservative U.S. political
lobbyist has been called to testify in an investigation into the
extradition of a Honduran man convicted in the United States of
drug trafficking, a judge announced Sunday.
	   Deborah De Moss, a former aide to U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms, has
been asked to testify Tuesday, Judge Roberto Villalobos said. Her
husband, retired Honduran army Col. Hector Rene Fonseca, has also
been summoned.
	   Justice officials are investigating the 1988 extradition of Juan
Ramon Matta. Prosecutors say U.S. and Honduran police kidnapped
Matta and took him to the United States in violation of Honduras'
constitutional ban on extradition.
	   The case set off violent protests in 1988, including the burning
of a U.S. Embassy office and the deaths of five people.
	   Matta's family claims De Moss was involved in the extradition.
They say a videotape shows her standing next to the former Honduran
armed forces chief, Gen. Humberto Regalado, when he was honored for
capturing Matta.
	   Regalado is among several people being targeted by prosecutors
in the case.
	   Matta, who was convicted of drug trafficking in a U.S. court, is
serving a life sentence in a Colorado prison.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian government began
erecting a 10-foot (3-meter) high fence around Rio stock exchange
to prevent violence from disrupting the sale of the state-held
telecommunications company, Telebras.
	   Telebras is scheduled to be sold at the Rio de Janeiro stock
exchange on Wednesday, barring any last-minute court injunctions
designed to derail the sale.
	   The government has set a 13.5 billion real (dlrs 11.7 billion)
minimum price tag on the company, making it Latin America's largest
privatization. The sale has attracted many of the world's largest
telecom companies.
	   In addition to the fence, the government announced that at least
1,500 policemen will be on hand to prevent demonstrators from
interrupting Wednesday's sale.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A moderate earthquake shook the western
Mexican state of Guerrero on Sunday but there were no reports of
material damage or injuries.
	   The magnitude-4.7 quake occurred at 11:24 a.m. (1524 GMT) and
was centered along the Pacific Coast in southern Guerrero, the
government news agency Notimex reported. ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Ten Cubans whose boat broke up at sea while
en route to the Florida coast were rescued by a passing ship and
brought to a Mexican port in Tamaulipas state, a report said
Sunday.
	   A Cypriot vessel picked up the seven men, two women and a boy
and carried them to Altamira on Friday, the daily La Jornada
reported. The Cubans, who said they wanted to go to the United
States to improve their economic situation, expected they would be
returned to Cuba.
	   The group's fiberglass launch had left Cuba on July 18, a port
official told the newspaper. ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian Air Force is
preparing a funeral for a pilot whose AMX fighter plane plummeted
into the sea two days ago, Globo News reported Sunday.
	   The body of Lt. Col. Cesar Bonbonatto was found Saturday
afternoon off the Brazilian coast near Restinga da Marambaia, about
64 kilometers (40 miles) west of Rio de Janeiro.
	   Bonbonatto, 42, was on a routine training flight with two other
pilots when his plane plunged unexpectedly into the sea. The cause
of the accident is still under investigation.
	   A spokesman for the Air Force was unavailable on Sunday.

	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) _ Two Mexican soldiers were shot and wounded
in an attack blamed on leftist rebels in the southern Mexican state
of Oaxaca, the state attorney general said Sunday.
	   Gunmen traveling in a van opened fire on soldiers at the
military reserve in San Andres Huayapan, on the outskirts of Oaxaca
city, about 11 p.m. (0300 GMT Sunday) Saturday, state Attorney
General Roberto Pedro Martinez Ortiz said.
	   Investigators suspected members of the Popular Revolutionary
Army, he said.
	   The soldiers, Alberto Santiago Cruz, 25, and Aniceto Martinez
Santaella, 16, were taken to a Oaxaca hospital.
	   The rebel group, known by its Spanish initials EPR, rose up in
neighboring Guerrero state in June 1996 to demand political reform.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Oil gushing from a ruptured Ecuadorian
pipeline has damaged marine life along a 39-mile (62 km) stretch of
Colombia's pacific coast and threatens an ecological reserve,
authorities reported Sunday.
	   The pipeline burst last month due to a landslide.
	   Currents pushed the petroleum slowly north into Colombian
waters, where it has blackened beaches and will destroy sea plants,
said Jesus Rosero, governor of the southern Colombian province
affected by the spill.
	   Damage was concentrated near the Colombian port city of Tumaco.
	   But the spill was also headed towards the Gorgona Island
ecological reserve and requires a cleanup by authorities from both
countries, added Rosero.

Russia, South Korea fail to resolve diplomatic row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Russia and
South Korea met in Manila but failed to resolve a diplomatic row
touched off by spy charges, officials said Monday.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his South Korean
counterpart, Park Chung-soo, met for 75 minutes _ 30 minutes longer
than scheduled _ on Sunday but could not resolve the dispute,
Foreign Ministry officials said.
	   The foreign ministers were in Manila to attend a meeting of the
Asian Regional Forum, a security forum, which opened on Monday.
	   The row started on July 4 when Russia ordered the expulsion of a
South Korean diplomat in Moscow after he reportedly was caught
accepting classified documents from a Russian contact.
	   The Russian, identified as a senior Foreign Ministry official,
was later arrested on treason charges.
	   South Korea retaliated four days later by expelling a Russian
diplomat in Seoul, saying he had engaged in ``activities that go
against his status as a diplomat.''
	   Then, on July 20, South Korea withdrew five more officials from
Russia under an agreement to limit the number of intelligence
agents each country assigns to its diplomatic missions.
	   South Korean officials had hoped that would end the dispute.
	   But at the foreign ministers' meeting in Manila, Russia raised
the issue again and asked South Korea to retract its earlier
decision that expelled the Russian diplomat in Seoul.
	   ``Both sides spent most of the time exchanging views on the
issue. There was no time to discuss other issues, including a
proposed summit between the two countries,'' a Foreign Ministry
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The foreign ministers were to have discussed a planned meeting
between their presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Kim Dae-jung, during an
Asian-Pacific Economic Forum conference in Malaysia in November.
	   They also were to have discussed a proposed state visit to
Russia by the South Korean president early next year.
	   It was the most serious diplomatic dispute reported between
Moscow and Seoul since the former adversaries opened formal
diplomatic relations in 1990. Russia's predecessor, the former
Soviet Union, was a longtime ally of Seoul's rival, communist North
Korea.
	   Relations between Seoul and Moscow have warmed significantly in
the recent past, while ties between Moscow and Pyongyang have
cooled considerably.

Purler's pin helps U.S. to wrestling gold.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ An old college trick _ and a little luck _
helped Tony Purler spark the United States to the Goodwill Games'
wrestling gold medal Sunday.
	   Jet lag might have had a hand in it, too.
	   Purler, from Norman, Oklahoma, pinned Murat Ramanazov of Russia
in 27 seconds of their 128-pound (58 kilos) match, the second of
four straight wins that sent the American team to a 16-14 dual meet
victory.
	   The Russians adjusted their lineup to try to combat the U.S.
quickness, moving Ramazanov up from 119 pounds (53 kilos) to face
Purler.
	   But the strategy backfired when Purler, a 1993 NCAA champion at
Nebraska, put Ramazanov on his back almost as soon as the match
began.
	   ``He got his legs crossed, I grabbed his knee and put him in a
hold,'' Purler said. ``It was one of my old college moves. It was
luck. You don't get many falls in international competition.''
	   The pin was good for four points and, added to an opening
decision by Sam Hensen over Leonid Chuchunov, put the United States
on track for victory.
	   ``We made some things happen in those first two matches,'' U.S.
coach John Smith said.
	   The home team got another boost when world champion Les Gutches
scored a takedown with 50 seconds remaining to defeat Olympic
champion Khadzimurad Magomedov 4-3 at 187.
	   Gutches, from Corvallis, Ore., said the Russians may have been
fighting jet lag, having only arrived in New York Friday.
	   ``The third day is the hardest day on your body,'' he said.
``And that may be a little evidence of what we're seeing today.''
	   Smith said the Goodwill gold would be a springboard for the
world championships, scheduled for Iran. The Iranian team staged a
brief walkout of its Saturday night match against the United States
because of demonstrations by anti-Tehran exiles in the crowd at
Madison Square Garden.
	   The American wrestlers, who competed in Tehran earlier this
year, said they didn't think there'd be a payback for them when
they return in September.
	   ``I think that the Iranian Wrestling Federation and the Iranian
government in particular have a lot to gain from us getting there
and getting back safe,'' Gutches said. ``I'm going there to win a
world championship, I don't care if I have to sleep in a barn and
set my stuff on a bale of hay.''

Brazilians win beach volleyball gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. gold medal in women's platform diving. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ On a pile of sand dumped on an ice-skating rink
surrounded by skyscrapers, a pair of Brazilians showed why they are
the world's top-ranked beach volleyball team and kept the sport's
senior dude from adding another victory to his record list.
	   Guilherme Marques and Para Ferreira beat the U.S. team of Karch
Kiraly and Adam Johnson 12-11, 12-4 Sunday to win the gold medal at
the Goodwill Games.
	   With almost 1 million pounds of sand imported from Canada to
cover Wollman Rink in Central Park, a sport that's used to endless
horizons of the seashore was played with huge shade trees nearby
and the office buildings, hotels and apartment towers of midtown
Manhattan looming above.
	   A near-capacity crowd of 2,800 was charged up early, hoping to
see the 37-year-old Kiraly, who is often mentioned as his sport's
Babe Ruth, Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan, add another title to
the 130 he has won over his 12-year career.
	   It started well for the U.S. team, but the Brazilians, the
defending world champions, took control late in the first game and
dominated the second to sweep the best-of-3 match for the gold
medal.
	   The Brazilians, who shared dlrs 30,000 as champions, definitely
had age on their side, with the 29-year-old Guilherme five years
older than Para, who is considered the best player in the world
right now. Johnson, 33, and Kiraly, partners on the U.S.
professional circuit, split dlrs 20,000 for winning the silver.
	   ``You can look at the score and say `Oh, that was easy,' but
it's not just the score,'' Guilherme said. ``This tournament was
very difficult with a lot of great players, especially one today
who has a lot of international experience.''
	   The U.S. team had a 9-6 lead in the opening game, but the
Brazilians ran off five straight points to set up a game point.
Kiraly and Johnson managed to tie it 11-11 with Kiraly making a
great diving save on one point and coming up with a great stuff at
the net for the other.
	   The Brazilians got the serve back on the next play, then put the
opening game away with an immediate point.
	   Guilherme and Para _ just like Brazil's soccer player, they
usually go by one name only _ took command of the second game with
a 6-point run for an 8-1 lead. The second game was much closer to
the early round meeting that Brazil won 15-3, Kiraly and Johnson's
only loss before the gold medal match.
	   ``Even after the first game we thought we were in good shape,''
Kiraly said. ``We took them out of their game but they still played
really well and beat us. They picked it up and we didn't.''
	   Kiraly was terse when asked if the United States had to give up
the mantle of best beach volleyball country in the world to Brazil.
	   ``They're playing very well right now,'' he said.
	   The air temperature was 81 degrees and a thermometer in the sand
registered 102 degrees, well off the 125 that was recorded earlier
in the week.
	   In the match for the bronze medal, Martin Conde and Eduardo
Martinez of Argentina beat Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner of
Australia 12-11, 12-9.
	   What Kiraly and Johnson couldn't do, the U.S. wrestlers could _
win gold.
	   They beat Russia 16-14 for the title, with victories from Sam
Henson, Tony Purler, Cary Kolat, Lincoln McIlravy and Les Gutches.
	   Turkey beat Iran 16-13 for the bronze medal in a meet that had
none of the loud political protests by anti-Tehran exiles that
disrupted the U.S. win over the Iranians Saturday night.
	   American cyclists won gold, too, taking an unusual two-day team
race over a squad of men and women riders from a handful of
countries. Russia was third.
	   Laura Wilkinson, a University fo Texas sophomore, nailed her
final try to win the women's platform diving gold medal. It was the
first U.S. gold in the pool.
	   World champion Dmitry Sautin of Russia won the men's 3-meter
springboard, beating Troy Dumais of the United States by almost 49
points. Dumais led early but Sautin, the Olympic platform champion,
registered a string of 8.5's and 9's to win.
	   Gymnastics concluded with Huang Xu and Ling Jie of China taking
gold in the mixed team event, edging women's world champion
Svetlana Korkina and Alexei Nemov of Russia by 0.275 points. Anna
Kovaleva and Aleksei Bondorenko of Russia took the bronze, the
sixth medal of the games for Bondorenko, tying a meet record.
	   Doctors, meanwhile, reported that paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang
Lan was able to sit up Sunday after surgery that rebuilt her upper
spine, fractured in a practice accident on the vault. But they
repeated earlier statements that the 17-year-old probably would
never walk again.

Howard welcomes Obuchi, urges further economic reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John Howard
on Monday wished prospective Japanese prime minister Keizo Obuchi
well and hoped more action would be taken to reform Japan's
economy.
	   ``He certainly has a lot of experience and we all hope that
there'll be further measures taken to strengthen the Japanese
economy,'' Howard told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Obuchi, currently foreign minister, was elected president of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Friday. He is expected to be
formally voted into office as prime minister Thursday.
	   ``I wish him well, I've written to him, I hope to have early
contact with him and I expect to see him at the APEC (Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation) meeting in Kuala Lumpur later this year.''
	   Japan is the world's second largest economy and Australia's
biggest export customer.
	   ``It is very important to Australia (that Japan make economic
reforms) because Japan is such a big economy and such a strong
customer of Australia,'' Howard said.
	   Japan's economy is in recession with growth weighed down by a
host of factors, including weak domestic demand, loads of bad debt
in the country's banking system and the Asian economic crisis.
	   Howard's comments follow those of Industry Minister John Moore,
who has questioned Obuchi's credentials to rescue Japan's economy.
	   ``Unless the new Japanese prime minister has stronger economic
credentials than the (news)papers present him as (having), one has
to have some concern about the Japanese economy,'' Moore said.

Wilkins win swomen's platform, Sautin wins third diving gold for

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. UPDATES with Wilkinson winning women's platform &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL BARNARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ The first U.S. diving gold medal at
the Goodwill Games came from an unlikely source.
	   Laura Wilkinson of Houston, fifth in the platform at this year's
World Championships, defeated three women who beat her in that
event Sunday, edging Cai Yuyan of China by just 2.64 points.
	   If Wilkinson's surprise gold showed the future of diving, then
the present had a strong day, too.
	   Dmitry Sautin of Russia, the world'd best diver, easily beat
American teen-ager Troy Dumais for the men's 3-meter springboard
gold.
	   Wilkinson was in second place going into the last round, but she
scored 67.20 points with a back 2{ somersault with 2{ twists, while
Cai had 61.20 with a forward 3{ from a pike position.
	   ``I was trying not to think about it,'' Wilkinson said of the
pressure of trying to take No. 1 on the last attempt. ``I just
wanted to hit my dive.''
	   Wilkinson, a 20-year-old Texas sophomore, trailed Cai, Olena
Zhupina of Ukraine and Chantelle Michell of Australia in the World
Championships in Perth, Australia. On Sunday, Cai was second,
Zhupina fourth and Michell 10th.
	   Wilkinson had 504.21 points and Cai 501.57. Sang Xue of China
won the bronze with 483.45. Zhupina's total was 482.44.
	   Sautin, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the 1994 and 1998
world champion on the platform, duplicated his worl title on the
springboard.
	   He finished nearly 49 points ahead of Dumais, whose silver-medal
performance was a major climb from his 10th-place finish in 3-meter
at the World Championships in Perth, Australia.
	   Sautin never failed to get at least one mark of 8.5 or better on
each of his 11 dives and finished with 696.99 points, while Dumais,
18, of Ventura, Calif., was second with 648.15.
	   ``I try not to miss too many dives, but I'm human, I'm alive,''
Sautin said. ``Good training and the coach definitely play a major
part. I've been training since childhood. I started platform diving
when I was 9 years old.''
	   Dumais was 10th in the Goodwill 1-meter, an event in which he
finished second at the World Championships, and he criticized
himself for allowing ``stupid thoughts'' to enter his head.
	   ``Today, all I did was concentrate on doing my dive,'' Dumais
said. ``I sort of think in the opposite direction. Instead of
thinking (a dive) downwards, I think upwards.''
	   Dumais called Sautin ``a diving machine,'' but said he could
beat the Russian before too long.
	   ``This second-place finish gives me confidence in the future,''
he said. ``This should help me a a lot.''
	   Zhou Yilin of China won the bronze medal with 636.78 points. Zou
won the silver medal in the 1-meter ahead of Mark Ruiz of Orlando,
Florida, who was 10th in the 3-meter.

	   SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) _ Standing before the stone army barracks
where he launched his revolt 45 years before, Fidel Castro told
Cuba's communist faithful that the revolution remains intact
despite economic hardship.
	   ``We now have to perfect it, to become stronger, more cultured,
more prepared,'' the 71-year-old leader said after listing the
accomplishments of his socialist revolution: free education and
health care, access to utilities, home ownership.
	   All that, he said, ``despite the enormous difficulties of the
special period,'' _ the official term for the economic crisis that
slammed Cuba when it lost its Soviet bloc trading partners at the
beginning of this decade.
	   ``In difficult moments, the people unite to support the
revolution,'' Manuel Valdez, 63, a retired soldier from this
eastern provincial city, said shortly before Castro took the stage.
``I am proud to be part of the revolution.''
	   Dressed in his trademark olive military fatigues but without his
billed cap, Castro started out with a lengthy history lesson about
Santiago, which was invaded by the U.S. military a century ago this
year _ and one of his traditional attacks on the U.S. government.
	   ``On April 19, 1898, the U.S. Congress adopted a joint
resolution declaring that the people of Cuba should be free and
independent. It was was a deceitful resolution,'' Castro said.
Spanish rule of Cuba ended when the Americans landed in 1898, but
the United States continued to control the Caribbean island until
1902.
	   ``It is good to remember these things,'' he said, his voice
breaking frequently as he started out, but growing stronger and
clearer as the speech wore on. He also called ``illegal'' the U.S.
military's continued presence at Guantanamo Bay, on the island's
eastern tip.
	   Some 10,000 people crowded into a clearing before the Moncada
barracks where Castro and his followers launched a disastrous
offensive against the Cuban army. Although the attackers were
repelled, and either killed or jailed, the offensive is seen as the
start of the revolution that triumphed 5 1/2 years later.
	   Earlier in the day, some of Castro's first followers returned to
Granjita Siboney, the farming village where they spent the night
before the 1953 attack on the Moncada barracks that began the
uprising, to tell schoolchildren about the battle and to urge them
not to lose faith in the revolution.
	   ``When we were your age we didn't have even a tenth of what you
now have,'' Pedro Gutierrez, 69, told the children. ``We feel very
proud to have put our grain of sand into defeating the dictatorship
and helping to bring us everything that we have today.''
	   But these are troubled times in Cuba. A decades-old U.S.
economic embargo has taken a heavy toll, and most foreign aid dried
up almost a decade ago with the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
	   Although few people are starving, poverty is widespread and
begging and prostitution are common in the main cities.
	   But the old rebels have few regrets. ``Despite the blockade and
the economic crisis, people are living better than we were in
1953,'' Jose Luis Lopez Villa, 74, said.

	   EAST MEADOW, New York (AP) _ A Chinese gymnast paralyzed in a
fall at the Goodwill Games was able to sit up after successful
spinal surgery, but doctors repeated that she probably would never
walk again.
	   Since the seven-hour operation Saturday to rebuild her upper
spine, Sang Lan has regained some strength in her shoulders and
biceps, said Dr. Vincent Leone, director of spinal surgery at
Nassau County Medical Center. But there has been no improvement in
mobility in her hands, wrists and legs.
	   The operation, which stabilized her spine, did allow Sang, 17,
to sit up in bed Sunday, something that was impossible before the
surgery, Leone told a news conference.
	   Given the complexity of the injury and the healing process, it
was too soon to say how quickly the gymnast would progress and what
her final prognosis will be, Leone said, adding it was unlikely she
would ever walk again. He made the same statement on Wednesday, a
day after the accident.
	   Sunday night, after the gymnastics competition closed with an
exhibition performance, the Chinese team joined Sang's parents in
visiting her in her hospital room.
	   Sang had asked to watch the event on television, but officials
were unable to run the proper cables into her intensive-care unit
room, Goodwill Games spokeswoman Jan Fanbro said. She said Sang
would watch the exhibition later on tape.
	   Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault champion, struck the mat
with her head after missing a simple vault during practice.
	   The goal of Saturday's surgery was to stabilize Sang's spine by
screwing three titanium plates into the section of the neck injured
in the fall. Surgeons also removed broken bone fragments and used
bits of bone from her left hip to fuse together vertebrae.
	   ``The implants basically prevent her head from falling off her
shoulders,'' Leone said.
	   Sang is also being treated with an experimental nerve drug that
doctors said was her only hope of walking again. But it was too
early to say if the drug, which provides the building blocks for
nerves to repair themselves, was working, Leone said.
	   ``There are just so many different nerve connections that have
to heal,'' he said.
	   Sang's parents _ who arrived from China just hours after the
surgery _ were driven from Kennedy Airport to the hospital and did
not speak to reporters. They plan to give a news conference in the
next several days, hospital spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg said.
	   Sang will have to stay at the hospital for at least a week under
observation, and her parents have not decided whether to continue
treatment for their only child here or move her back home.
	   Before her parents left China, Sang's saddened friends made
1,000 paper birds for the couple to take with them _ symbols of
their wishes for a quick recovery.
	   Sang's parents rarely saw their child, who was chosen for
national-team training when she was 11. Since then, her parents
have seen her only three times, most recently in October, as their
only daughter trained 740 miles (1190 kilometers) from home in
Beijing.
	   Physicians and others who visited Sang on Sunday said that she
was in high spirits.
	   ``This young lady did not stop talking,'' said Nassau County
Executive Thomas S. Gulotta. ``Her spirit was uplifting, you had to
be encouraged to be in her presence.''
	   Goodwill Games spokesman Michael Lewellen reiterated an earlier
pledge by the event's sponsor, Turner Sports, and its parent
company, Time-Warner Inc., to provide all possible resources to
secure the family's future.
	   Lewellen said details had yet to be finalized.
	   ``The family has only been here for a few hours,'' he said.
``They haven't had the opportunity to state their wishes.''

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Three U.S. lawmakers have asked President
Alvaro Arzu's administration to maintain its support of the 1996
peace accords which ended Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
	   Democratic Reps. Ciro Rodriguez of Texas and Nancy Pelosi and
George Miller of California told reporters Sunday that they hoped
the April slaying of a Catholic bishop would not shake the
country's confidence in the accords.
	   Bishop Juan Gerardi Conodera was bludgeoned to death in his
garage two days after he had presented a human rights report which
blamed the army and pro-military death squads for most of the
deaths and disappearances during the war.
	   Speculation initially fell on the military or the death squads,
but last week police arrested a priest and a church cook in
connection with Gerardi's death.
	   The three lawmakers came to Guatemala on Friday to learn about
developments in the case and to request that the government make
sure the investigation is carried out justly and transparently.
	   The met with government officials, including Defense Minister
Gen. Hector Mario Barrios Celada, Foreign Minister Eduardo Stain
Barillas and Interior Minister Rodolfo Mendoza Rosales. They also
spoke with the nation's human rights attorney general and human
rights watchdog groups.
	   They were to return to Washington on Monday.

<TEXT>
	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ The first U.S. diving gold medal at
the Goodwill Games came from an unlikely source.
	   Laura Wilkinson of Houston, fifth in the platform at this year's
World Championships, defeated three women who beat her in that
event Sunday, edging Cai Yuyan of China by just 2.64 points.
	   If Wilkinson's surprise gold showed the future of diving, then
the present had a strong day, too.
	   Dmitry Sautin of Russia, the world's best diver, easily beat
American teen-ager Troy Dumais for the men's 3-meter springboard
gold.
	   Wilkinson was in second place going into the last round, but she
scored 67.20 points with a back 2 1/2 somersault with 2 1/2 twists,
while Cai had 61.20 with a forward 3 1/2 from a pike position.
	   ``I was trying not to think about it,'' Wilkinson said of the
pressure of trying to take No. 1 on the last attempt. ``I just
wanted to hit my dive.''
	   Wilkinson, a 20-year-old Texas sophomore, trailed Cai, Olena
Zhupina of Ukraine and Chantelle Michell of Australia in the World
Championships in Perth, Australia. On Sunday, Cai was second,
Zhupina fourth and Michell 10th.
	   Wilkinson had 504.21 points and Cai 501.57. Sang Xue of China
won the bronze with 483.45. Zhupina's total was 482.44.
	   Sautin, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the 1994 and 1998
world champion on the platform, duplicated his world title on the
springboard.
	   He finished nearly 49 points ahead of Dumais, whose silver-medal
performance was a major climb from his 10th-place finish in the
3-meter at the World Championships in Perth.
	   Sautin never failed to get at least one mark of 8.5 or better on
each of his 11 dives and finished with 696.99 points, while Dumais,
18, of Ventura, California, was second with 648.15.
	   ``I try not to miss too many dives, but I'm human, I'm alive,''
Sautin said. ``Good training and the coach definitely play a major
part. I've been training since childhood. I started platform diving
when I was 9 years old.''
	   Dumais was 10th in the Goodwill 1-meter, an event in which he
finished second at the World Championships, and he criticized
himself for allowing ``stupid thoughts'' to enter his head.
	   ``Today, all I did was concentrate on doing my dive,'' Dumais
said. ``I sort of think in the opposite direction. Instead of
thinking (a dive) downwards, I think upwards.''
	   Dumais called Sautin ``a diving machine,'' but said he could
beat the Russian before too long.
	   ``This second-place finish gives me confidence in the future,''
he said. ``This should help me a a lot.''
	   Zhou Yilin of China won the bronze medal with 636.78 points.
Zhou won the silver medal in the 1-meter ahead of Mark Ruiz of
Orlando, Florida, who was 10th in the 3-meter.

Malaysian child dies of dehydration inside parked car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A five-year-old boy died of
dehydration inside a parked car while his mother shopped for
groceries, a news report said Monday.
	   Lim Chang Sheng's body was found Sunday afternoon, with a
serious sunburn and nosebleed, after he wandered from his mother
and two siblings as they shopped at a supermarket in the southern
state of Johor, the New Straits Times quoted a relative of the
family as saying.
	   Lim's mother, whose name was withheld, said she took her three
children shopping at 11 a.m. and realized three hours later that
Lim had disappeared.
	   After searching inside the supermarket, she returned to her car
at 4 p.m. and discovered her child's body.
	   The New Straits Times article said the boy apparently returned
to the car by himself to wait for his mother.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stock, late morning bond and currency
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose sharply against the yen Monday
morning amid disappointment about the likely shape of the next
prime minister's administration. Tokyo stock prices tumbled.
	   The dollar bought 141.83 yen in early trading, up 1.29 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
141.44 yen on Friday.
	   The U.S. currency gained ground against the yen on worry
outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's likely replacement,
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, will be unable to put Japan's
economy back on track for recovery, traders said.
	   Obuchi was elected to head the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
on Friday, a post which will almost certainly enable him to succeed
fellow LDP member Hashimoto in a Parliamentary vote expected
Thursday.
	   Hashimoto announced he would resign after his ruling LDP
suffered a devastating setback in July 12 elections for the upper
house of Parliament.
	   Traders signaled concern that Obuchi, known more for his
congeniality than policymaking skills, was reported Monday to be
leaning toward appointing elderly former premier Kiichi Miyazawa as
finance minister in his Cabinet.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, share prices posted a
big drop in line with the weakening of the yen and a general lack
of enthusiasm for an Obuchi-led government, traders said.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average sank 280.27 points, or 1.71
percent, to 16,081.62 as of midday. On Friday, the average closed
up 173.88 points, or 1.07 percent.
	   ``Market participants are worried that the choice of Cabinet
members will likely be driven by rivalries among factions (within
the LDP),'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock
division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 18.30 points, or 1.45 percent, to 1,239.71. The
TOPIX closed up 8.14 points, or 0.65 percent, on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.330 percent from Friday's finish of 1.370 percent,
driving its price up to 110.89 yen from 110.68 yen.

Vote counting begins in Cambodia, fears of trouble remain

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Officials began tallying results
Monday from Cambodia's parliamentary elections following a massive
turnout by millions of voters hoping their ballots will bring the
tragedy-stricken country a new chance at peace and stability.
	   Despite a largely peaceful and surprisingly smooth vote Sunday,
fears persisted that trouble may lie ahead in the counting process
or after results become known and political leaders with deep
grudges against each other jockey for position in a likely
coalition.
	   An attack by die-hard remnants of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla
group against a military outpost that left 10 people dead was the
most serious trouble reported Sunday. But in a far more historic
move, thousands of ex-revolutionaries who have made peace in recent
years cast the first ballots in their lives.
	   In Phnom Penh, election officials began unsealing the boxes and
counting ballots cast by some 5.3 million of their countrymen.
Crowds of workers, observers and party officials milled around or
peered through windows to make sure there was no cheating.
	   The Committee for Free Elections in Cambodia, the leading
national observation group, issued a statement saying that despite
scattered irregularities the ``polling took place smoothly and with
few incidents.''
	   Thung Sary, COMFREL president, told a news conference he was
afraid of disruption at counting stations when authorities linked
to strongman Hun Sen discovered the ruling Cambodian People's Party
was getting fewer votes than expected.
	   The main post-count worry was ``the reaction of activists or
leaders of different parties, because they have supporters in the
military or police,'' Thung Sary said. ``The extent of the problem
could depend on the result. If the ruling party gets one-third, I
worry perhaps we will have some problems.''
	   The National Election Committee expected to be able to announce
preliminary results later Monday, but it was unclear if there would
be an immediate breakdown for the 122 National Assembly seats from
which a new government will be formed.
	   Hun Sen was widely accused during the campaign of using
violence, including murder, and intimidating voters to ensure
victory. But no party was likely to win the two-thirds of seats
necessary to fully control the legislature.
	   The two main challengers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy, were expected to be in talks with the ruling party about
reaching a power-sharing arrangement. That could lead either to
stability or, as in the past, sow the seeds for more turmoil.
	   In 1993, Ranariddh's royalist FUNCIPEC won elections organized
by the United Nations under the protection of 20,000 peacekeepers.
The vote was the most democratic in Cambodian history.
	   But Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 during the harsh
Vietnamese occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge regime, refused
to accept the result and forced his way into a joint premiership by
threatening civil war.
	   A year ago, Hun Sen ended the arrangement by sending tanks into
the streets of Phnom Penh and deposing the prince in two days of
fighting followed by a looting rampage.
	   Ranariddh was allowed to return when Hun Sen called new
elections in a bid to win back international legitimacy and aid.
Phnom Penh residents, who feared he might call out the army if he
loses, stocked up on rice and other essentials in recent weeks.
	   The biggest difference since 1993 was the change in fortunes of
the Khmer Rouge. Five years ago, they were a formidable fighting
force. Now, following two years of mass defections, only a few
hundred hard-liners are still fighting in the northern jungles.
	   They vowed to disrupt the polls, but the two attacks they staged
in recent weeks amounted to spoiling tactics and had no national
impact.
	   The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people
when they ruled between 1975 and 1979.

Myanmar pro-democracy activists stage Tokyo sit-in

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Several pro-democracy activists from Myanmar began
a sit-in Monday in front of their country's embassy in Tokyo
protesting a military blockade of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   Suu Kyi was stopped Friday morning 51 kilometers (32 miles),
west of Yangon, Myanmar's capital, while driving to the western
city of Bassein to meet members of her political party.
	   It was the third time that Myanmar's military government has
tried to block her from traveling to townships outside Yangon in
recent weeks. As of Sunday there had been no resolution to the
standoff and Suu Kyi prepared to spend a third night in her car.
	   ``We want the world to know that Burmese people are still under
the oppression of the military regime,'' said Kyaw Lun Tin,
secretary of the National League for Democracy's Japan branch, in a
statement.
	   Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   A spokesman at Tokyo's Shinagawa police station said an
unspecified number of police were posted around the Myanmar
Embassy, but that no trouble was reported with the protest.
	   An official at embassy, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
several activists were seen conducting a sit-in near the building's
gate Monday morning.
	   The sit-in was scheduled to last one day, the release said.

Padres beat Houston, 5-4
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ In 41 straight save chances, Trevor Hoffman had
been perfect. Then on one pitch, his streak ended and so did his
bid to set a major league record.
	   The San Diego closer gave up a home run to Moises Alou on his
first delivery in the ninth inning Sunday, tying the game. The
Padres wound up beating Houston 5-4 in the 10th, but Hoffman blew
his chance at history.
	   Hoffman entered the game to the loud sounds of AC/DC's ``Hell's
Bells'' playing over the public address system, just as he did
Saturday when he matched the consecutive save record of 41 set by
San Francisco's Rod Beck from 1993-95.
	   After the music, most of the 41,034 fans stood to cheer for
Hoffman. There was just silence, however, after Alou connected for
his 25th homer of the season to tie it at 4.
	   Hoffman, who had recorded 33 saves this season, had not blown a
save chance since last Aug. 22.
	   The Padres won in the 10th on Andy Sheets' RBI single with two
outs off Mike Magnante (3-5). Donne Wall (4-2) picked up the
victory.
 &UR; Giants 2, Reds 1, 10 innings
	   In San Francisco, Jeff Kent hit reliever Stan Belinda's second
pitch for a home run in the 10th inning, giving the San Francisco
Giants a victory over the Cincinnati Reds.
	   After Cincinnati's Brett Tomko two-hit the Giants over a
career-best nine innings, Belinda (4-7) allowed Kent's fourth homer
in three games and 13th of the year, a drive into the left-field
bleachers.
	   Jose Mesa (1-0) struck out the side in the 10th for his first
victory since joining San Francisco on Friday. It also marks the
first series the slumping Giants have won since the All-Star break.
 &UR; Cubs 3, Mets 1
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa hit his 38th homer and Kerry Wood
remained unbeaten at Wrigley Field as the Chicago Cubs downed the
New York Mets, giving them a 3 1/2-game lead in the NL wild-card
race.
	   With the Cubs trailing 1-0 in the sixth, Sosa drove a 2-2 pitch
from Rick Reed (11-7) into the shrubbery beyond the center-field
wall, following a one-out walk to Jose Hernandez.
	   Wood (10-5) allowed four hits in seven innings and ran his home
record to 7-0 in nine career starts at Wrigley. The rookie walked
three, struck out six and gave up Brian McRae's 15th homer in the
third.
	   Rod Beck pitched the ninth for his 31st save, converting 14
straight chances.
 &UR; Phillies 10, Marlins 9
	   In Philadelphia, Rico Brogna hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom
of the ninth inning and the Philadelphia Phillies rallied from an
early seven-run deficit to beat the Florida Marlins.
	   Todd Zeile's two-run homer and RBI single helped the Marlins
take a 7-0 in the third inning. But the Phillies struck for their
32nd comeback win of the season, including their second victory
after trailing by seven runs.
	   Philadelphia won three of four games in the series, all three by
comeback. Scott Rolen homered and drove in four runs for the
Phillies.
	   Mark Leiter (5-2) was the winner and Antonio Alfonseca (2-5)
took the loss.
 &UR; Braves 2, Pirates 1
	   In Pittsburgh, Greg Maddux extended his four-year winning streak
against Pittsburgh, repeatedly squirming out of jams before Andres
Galarraga's go-ahead single in the eighth inning gave the Atlanta
Braves a victory.
	   Maddux (14-4), who had lost two of his previous three decisions,
made certain he didn't lose consecutive starts for the first time
this season by limiting the Pirates to a run on four hits in 7 2-3
innings.
	   Maddux improved to 5-0 in nine starts since last losing to
Pittsburgh on April 30, 1994.
	   Kerry Ligtenberg pitched the ninth for his 13th save. Former
Braves teammate Jason Schmidt (8-8) lost his seventh in a row.
 &UR; Brewers 6, Expos 5
	   In Milwaukee, Bob Hamelin and Jeff Cirillo hit home runs and
Darrin Jackson doubled home the tiebreaking run in the eighth
inning, lifting the Milwaukee Brewers over the Montreal Expos.
	   The Brewers overcame an injury to starting pitcher Cal Eldred.
He left the game because of a strained right arm after throwing one
warmup pitch before the second inning.
	   With the score 5-all in the eighth, Jeromy Burnitz drew a
one-out walk from Shayne Bennett (3-4), moved up on a groundout and
scored on Jackson's drive to right-center field.
	   Bob Wickman (5-6), who started the eighth, won in relief for the
second straight day.
 &UR; Cardinals 3, Rockies 1
	   In Denver, Mark McGwire ended an 0-for-16 slump with his major
league-leading 44th homer as St. Louis snapped Colorado's five-game
winning streak.
	   The homer, a 452-foot (138-meter) shot in the fourth inning,
broke the Cardinals' mark of 43 set by Johnny Mize in 1940 and was
McGwire's first since last Monday as he added to his major league
record for home runs before Aug. 1.
	   It was McGwire's only hit of the game _ he went 1-for-4 _ and
his first hit of any kind since last Monday. His 0-for-16 drought
was his longest of the season.
 &UR; Dodgers 5, Diamondbacks 3
	   In Los Angeles, Matt Luke and Eric Karros homered and Ismael
Valdes pitched five scoreless innings before leaving with an injury
as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   Four relievers combined to help Valdes (9-9) win three
consecutive starts for the first time since last August. The
right-hander gave up four hits before straining a muscle in his
left side while warming up for the sixth. He will be re-evaluated
on Monday.
	   Andy Fox had three hits for Arizona, including a bases-loaded,
two-run single in the eighth that narrowed the gap to 5-2.

Police say curry was source of cyanide-laced food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police investigating a mass poisoning that killed
four in western Japan said Monday they believe cyanide had been
mixed into a pot of curry served at a weekend festival. But they
still had no suspects in the case.
	   Four died and 60 were sickened after eating dishes of curry
served over rice at the local festival Saturday in Wakayama, 453
kilometers (283 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Cyanide had been found in leftover dishes and in the vomit of
some of those who fell ill.
	   About 150 investigators were questioning local residents Monday
and searching the area for traces of the poison, a police spokesman
in Wakayama said.
	   Police suspected the poison had been mixed into one of three
pots of curry prepared at a local resident's garage by a group of
housewives, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Those who died included an elementary school boy, 10, a high
school girl and the 64-year-old head of the local community group.
	   A local man told national broadcaster NHK that someone had
tasted the curry before it was taken to the festival site and
detected nothing unusual.
	   About 100 people attended the annual festival held in a vacant
neighborhood lot. The curry dish was served on disposable plates
under a white awning.
	   Shortly after the meals were distributed Saturday evening at
about 6 p.m., those who had eaten them became violently ill. Many
collapsed and began vomiting.
	   Among those who fell ill, 39 remained hospitalized.
	   Residents didn't know how anyone could have slipped poison into
the curry because someone had been watching over it from the time
it was taken to the festival ground until festival-goers were
served, the local man told NHK.
	   The poisonings prompted Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on
Monday to urge strict control over cyanide, according to Kyodo News
service.
	   ``I solemnly mourn for the victims of the poisoning. We have to
prevent wide circulation of cyanide,'' Hashimoto was quoted as
saying.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An air-conditioning technician drowned early
Monday when he drove his car off the runway of closed Kai Tak
airport and plunged into the water, police said.
	   The 20-year-old man surnamed Wong, and his passenger, a
29-year-old man surnamed Fung, were lost on the dimly lit,
3.5-kilometer (2.2-mile) runway when heading to a water-pumping
plant located at its end to carry out maintenance work, a police
spokeswoman said.
	   ``Maybe it was too dark, they couldn't find the plant and
instead plunged off the runway,'' the spokeswoman said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The runway juts into Kowloon Bay and is surrounded by water.
	   She said Fung managed to swim back to the runway and call
police. Police found Wong, who could not swim, unconscious in the
sea about 90 minutes later. He was declared dead on arrival at a
hospital, she said.
	   The South China Morning Post identified the victims as Fung
Wing-kit and Wong Wai-keung, but police would not verify their
names.
	   Kai Tak airport, famous for its low approach over the congested
urban center, was closed July 6 after 73 years of service.
	   The air cargo terminal since has been reopened after serious
mechanical and computer glitches halted air cargo services at the
new dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport.
	   A marathon was held earlier this month on the runway. The
government plans to use the passenger terminal as a shopping mall
temporarily, and eventually turn the airport into residential and
commercial developments.

World diamond congress opens in Bangkok
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The 28th World Diamond Congress opened
Monday morning in Bangkok with more than 300 industry professionals
from around the globe attending the four-day meeting.
	   Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panichpakdi delivered the opening addresses.
	   Gems and Jewelry have been one of Thailand's top ten exports for
over a decade, placing seventh through the first six months of 1988
by generating 44 billion baht (dlrs 1.07 billion).
	   Thailand is also the world's fifth largest center for diamond
cutting.
	   The skill level of Thai diamond cutters has improved so much in
recent years that DeBeers of South Africa, one of the world's
largest diamond suppliers, has increased the number of diamonds it
sends to Thailand for cutting, finishing and polishing.
	   Diamonds are not mined in Thailand, but the country has deposits
of rubies and sapphires.
