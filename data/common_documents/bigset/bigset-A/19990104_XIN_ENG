<HEADLINE> S. African Police Baffled by Cape Town Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- South African police Sunday were
still unable to establish what kind of bomb was used in Friday's car bomb
explosion at Cape Town's premier tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Police have offered a 50,000-Rand (8,600-U.S. Dollar) award for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the blast which injured five
people. Three people were treated at the scene and two others were treated
for shock.
</P>
<P>
In most of the 70 explosions which occurred in the Western Cape
Province last year, pipe bombs were used, according to South African Press
Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted police spokeswoman Anine de Beer as saying that police were
still studying photographs and video footage of the blast.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately the revolving security camera near the blast was turned
away when the explosion occurred, but it did record the scene prior to, and
after the explosion, and could contain valuable clues," de Beer said.
</P>
<P>
She said police believed the bomb was placed in the boot of a stolen
Toyota which was parked near the entrance to Victoria wharf.
</P>
<P>
She confirmed that police were aware that the recently released
Hollywood movie, The Siege, was showing at the waterfront in which Islam
and Moslems were portrayed as terrorists, adding that police would look
into all possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Moslem community in South Africa expressed
strong disapproval of distributing the movie in South Africa and demanded
an apology from Ster Kinekor, South Africa's largest cinema chain.

<HEADLINE> 7 Wounded in Israeli Air Raids on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Seven people, including a
Lebanese mother and her four daughters, were wounded on Sunday in
Israeli air raids on Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, the Orient
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying that Israeli jets
fired two air-to-surface missiles at a radio station run by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, near the country's
ancient Roman city of Baalbek in Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
The group's Voice of the Oppressed radio station, whose
transmitter was damaged during the air attack, went off the air,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli jets also fired four missiles at the hills around
the villages of Nabi Sheet and Janta, about 23 kilometers
southeast of Baalbek.
</P>
<P>
A 55-year-old woman and her four daughters were wounded in the
raid in Janta, scene of the Israeli air raids on December 20, in
which a mother and her six children were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli jets also injured a Hezbollah member and a Syrian
worker who happened to be walking in the area.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, the Israeli army spokesman confirmed the attack,
saying its jets blasted terrorist bases, including a Hezbollah
radio station.
</P>
<P>
Following the raids, Hezbollah's Vice Secretary-General Naiim
Gausem announced in Baalbek that his group reserved the right to
respond and will chose a proper time and ways for retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli attack came three days after its security cabinet
decided to attack Lebanon's infrastructure if and when its north
was hit again by Hezbollah's Katyusha attack.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli decision followed the group's Katyusha attack on
Israel's northern areas to revenge the killing of Lebanese
civilians in Janta, wounding at least 16 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation troops.

<HEADLINE> Financial Analysts Discuss Effects of Euro on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The launching of the European single
currency Euro Saturday will affect the value of Nigerian
currency Naira and Nigeria's foreign trade and other industries, according
to local analysts.
</P>
<P>
A special report carried by Sunday Tribune quoted R.O. Bakare of Unic
Insurance as saying that since the value of the Pound Sterling which is the
strongest of all European currencies is bound to fall, the development
would force the Naira to gain strength in the world market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the appreciation of the Naira would cause the prices of
imported items from European countries to fall, and this would be a boost
for individuals and companies in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
On how the Euro would affect insurance industry, Bakare said, since
insurance companies pay their premium through foreign exchange, the
appreciation of the local currency automatically means that insurance
companies would have to pay less.
</P>
<P>
V.O. Akinola of the Nigeria Arab Bank told the paper that dealing with
such a currency would not be easy, adding that Nigeria may have a lot of
problems deciding on the terms of trade and measurement of exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the issue of European single currency, a manager of
Afribank said the Euro would create some sort of monopoly in the European
market, which means Nigeria would have limited choice to make.
</P>
<P>
For example, he explained, in the new arrangement, Nigeria and other
countries willing to buy from Europe would not have the privilege of
dictating the country whose goods they prefer.
</P>
<P>
He said the Euro would have substantial effect on the banking system in
the west African country, adding that just as the U.S. Dollar is being used
as the unit of measurement because of its prominence in the world market,
the Euro may also become a standard of measurement as it is also likely to
gain more economic power and prominence.
</P>
<P>
Tayo Fagade, a financial analyst, was quoted as saying that the
introduction of the Euro may not have serious implication of the Nigerian
economy other than an easier foreign exchange system for Nigerian importers.
</P>
<P>
He cited the example of the recent crash of the Southeast Asian
economies with the attendant effects on the global economy which
accordingly affected Nigeria's economy.
</P>
<P>
"By and large, it will now be easy to do business with any member of
the European Union without any problem of foreign exchange since a single
currency would be in use," he added.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Inputs Still Dog Zambian Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Thirty four years after independence,
Zambia's agricultural sector is still characterized by desperate cries
from farmers over the no-availability or late delivery of inputs, Sunday
Times of Zambia reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted agricultural sector insiders as attributing this
perennial problem to a number of factors which need lasting solutions,
otherwise there may be an adverse effect on the country's food security.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Cooperative Federation managing director , Grieve Sibale said
the
inputs problem is likely to remain unchanged as long as the there is no
body set up to deal specifically with it.
</P>
<P>
"Each year we have this problem of inputs, it is either they come late
or when they do come, then we have distribution bottlenecks. This problem
is likely to be there as long as there is no institution to deal with
inputs specifically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sibale said that the problem has been further exacerbated by the
increasingly prevalent loans defaulting culture among some farmers
especially small scale ones, who are unwilling to repay their loans even if
they have a bumper harvest.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for a streamlined approach to the inputs issue,
Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) chief, Ajay Vashee, said that at the
moment, a clear-cut policy relating to this is lacking.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the market might have been liberalized and there
are now a number of private sector players, there appears to be no guiding
parameters within which they can operate.
</P>
<P>
Vashee proposed establishing a national fertilizer committee to be
composed of representatives from the government and fertilizer dealers, the
ZNFU and other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, while acknowledging the necessity of private sector
participation in the agricultural sector, veteran leader of Truckers
Association of Zambia, Charles Madondo, said that this involvement has on
the
whole, had a very token effect.
</P>
<P>
Madondo, who has had a 30 year involvement in the agriculture marketing
sector, noted that the private participants concentrate their efforts
in urban and peri-urban areas at the expense of the productive rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Expressing similar views, Program Against Malnutrition director Friday
Luhila said the private sector appears to be more interested in selling and
battering agricultural products instead of ensuring inputs reaching their
intended beneficiaries.

<HEADLINE> President Forces Me Out: Tanzanian Police Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Police Boss Cossy Odomel, who
has announced his plan to resign soon, said that he was forced by
President Yoweri Museveni to step down.
</P>
<P>
He made this remarks Saturday when interviewed by the New Vision
newspaper, which was published by the newspaper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Odomel said he was directed to resign from the top police post by the
appointing authority on the top of which is the president.
</P>
<P>
Hel did not specify the reasons for the directive although there is
speculation that the president acted on a corruption probe report about him.
</P>
<P>
Police Commander of Kampala Region Extra, Benjamin Namanya told Xinhua
Sunday morning in a telephone interview that he was greatly shocked at the
police boss' announcement at the party hosted Friday here to entertain
senior police commanders.
</P>
<P>
"I did not expect that at the time. Odomel just said he would quit his
job and live a civilian life. He did not say anything about what he would
do after resigning," Namanya said.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision report said the police boss is running businesses which
are supplying items to the police force.
</P>
<P>
He is alleged to have been a signatory to all payments and his
companies were always paid earlier than other suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The Inspector General of Government has since October 1998 been probing
Odomel's alleged amassing of wealth estimated at two billion shillings (two
million U.S. Dollars), but he said he had not seen any report on alleged
abuse of office.
</P>
<P>
This is shocking news to Ugandans following exposure of big scandals in
the privatization of parastatals in which one minister has resigned and
another is likely to face censure from the Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Pays Closer Attention to Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is paying more
attention to agricultural production in the new year.
</P>
<P>
 The government has decided to invest 600 million Kwacha(250,000 U.S.
Dollars) in the Zambia National Service (ZNS) and 246 million Kwacha(100,
000 Dollars) in the Prisons Service. Both are major agricultural
institutions in the country and have strong production bases.
</P>
<P>
 With thef money, the two organizations will be able to redouble their
efforts in improving their production.
</P>
<P>
 It has often been said that agriculture should be Zambia's economic
backbone and that the sector should be given the due support to develop to
levels that would truly make it the country's major source of livelihood.
</P>
<P>
 For long, however, the sector has either been mismanaged or merely
given lip-service.
</P>
<P>
 Today, even local farmers are in a dilemma as imported farm produce is
being preferred over local products. Several supermarkets imported produce
like tomatoes, carrots, oranges and even cabbages.
</P>
<P>
 Under such situation, the two institutions are being revamped.
With proper management they can make a major difference in the country's
agricultural production and supply to consumers. The two already have a
strong foundation and all that will be needed is to build an equally
strong structure.
</P>
<P>
 The private sector too seems to be on the right path but needs further
encouragement to improve its production. The problem, however, is that
cheaper imported products push some of the local produce out of business.
</P>
<P>
 This will soon be a thing of the past, Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi
 said,
as measures are being put in place to have more local products sold in
supermarkets and to tighten importation of farm produce, Zambia's
newspaper Sunday Mail reported.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Chairs Cabinet Meeting on U.S. Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on Sunday chaired the first cabinet session of this year on Sunday
to discuss his government's position toward the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Saddam accused the U.S. of spreading false information to "calm
the Arab public opinion rejective of such imperialistic
Anglo-American onslaught on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the U.S. allegation that it did not attack
Iraqi sites first, but the Iraqi air defense force started firing
at U.S. planes, according to the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
"What these planes are doing in flying over a state of
sovereignty and independence and why this state's air spaces are
being violated for eight years in time when the U.N. does not
issue a resolution endorsing such an act?" INA quoted Saddam as
asking.
</P>
<P>
The president added that such an act indicated a flagrant
breach of the U.N. Security Council resolutions which, although
being unjust, did call for respect to Iraq's integrity, political
independence and unity.
</P>
<P>
On the deferment of the Arab summit Yemen had called for,
Saddam said the purpose behind such postponement was to dismember
the Arab attitude regarding such an onslaught on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An Arab summit had been scheduled for the end of last year to
discuss the Arab position pertaining to the December 16-19
U.S.-British air strike against Iraq, but it was put off because
of objection of some Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said if the summit was being held during the air
strikes on Iraq by U.S. missiles, the Iraqi question would be the
sole one, but the postponement of the summit would indulge Arab's
attitude into a long list of issues.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that those who postponed the summit would hope
that the Arab stand toward the assault on Iraq would not take the
priority of topics, therefore they would carry out their hostile
role according to a scheme designed to attach Iraq and the Arab
Nation.

<HEADLINE> British PM to Visit S. Africa Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
is to visit South Africa Wednesday in a bid to promote relations between
the two countries, the Sunday Independent, a newspaper published here
reported.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day visit, Blair will have talks with South African
leaders focusing on building new relations which began after South Africa's
1994
elections. He is also expected to announce British assistance for South
Africa's election to be held in May.
</P>
<P>
Blair's visit follows South African President Nelson Mandela's trip to
Britain in July last year and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's meeting with
Blair at Downing Street in November.
</P>
<P>
It will also mark the second meeting of Britain-South Africa Bilateral
Forum, a body established in July last year to enhance existing trade,
development and investment relationships.
</P>
<P>
Trade ties between South Africa and Britain are certain to receive a
significant fillip this year as three of the seven billion-U.S. Dollar
defense contracts approved recently by the South African cabinet were won
by Britain.
</P>
<P>
Counter trade deals will see 5.7 billion U.S. Dollars worth of
bilateral trade in 1997 (up by 28 percent from 1996) surge this year,
according to South African trade officials.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Top Leader Calls for Campaign Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's ruling Communist Party
chief Le Kha Phieu said Sunday that Vietnam will launch a
campaign against bureaucracy and corruption in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary was speaking at a meeting with mediamen
here on the occasion of the new year, according to Vietnam News
Agency (VNA).
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Phieu regarded "bureaucracy and corruption in
the state apparatus as the biggest concerns", VNA said.
</P>
<P>
However, the top leader believed that the party, state and
people will "sweep away the evils with drastic measures".
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Politburo and PCC, party and state officials
will practice criticism and self-criticism and the party building
work will be combined with the fighting against bureaucracy and
corruption as well as the making of the party and state apparatus
to be clean and strong," Phieu said.
</P>
<P>
The party leader stressed that it should be "more determined to
dismiss degraded members from the party" so as to "build the party
strong in ideology, morality and lifestyle".
</P>
<P>
"The party revamping work will be implemented continuously in
many years", Phieu said.
</P>
<P>
The general secretary pointed out that "the regional financial
crisis is not the main reason of the lower growth rate of
Vietnam's national economy", but "mainly the subjective reasons
and weakness in management and control of the economic
structure".
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have not mobilized all our internal resources and
people's strength yet. The state apparatus is still bureaucratic,
cumbersome and less effective."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam should continue speeding up administrative reform to
make the state administrative system more effective, Phieu noted,
adding that the restructuring must be done step by step and all
social issues arisen during the process should be settled.
</P>
<P>
The party leader also said practicing thrift and fighting
wastefulness and bureaucracy must be strictly implemented.
</P>
<P>
He urged the entire party and people to practice thrift so as
to have more investments in boosting production and improve the
living conditions of the poor people.
</P>
<P>
Phieu held that the people's right to mastery must be
truthfully practiced and called for reorganizing patriotic
emulation movements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the journalists' role, the party leader stressed
that "as  fighters on the cultural and ideological front,
journalists have the tasks to disseminate the party's lines and
policies and to get in close touch with the daily life in order to
thoroughly understand realities to help the party and state work
out appropriate policies."
</P>
<P>
He added that journalists are also the people's voice and the
voice of justice, who "take an active part in the fight against
bureaucracy and corruption".

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission to Stop Flights into C. Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 3 (XInhua) -- The United Nations observer mission in
Angola said Sunday it will stop chartering planes including those
delivering humanitarian aid to central Angola where fighting are still
going on.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a time when a U.N. C-130 transport plane
was shot down Saturday in central Angola, bringing the number of planes
downed in the same area to two in eight days.
</P>
<P>
A press communique by the U.N. mission said the second plane crashed in
central Angola, about 80 km northwest of Huambo city, capital of Huambo
Province, where the government army was still fighting with the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) .
</P>
<P>
U.N. mission chief Issa Diallo confirmed that all U.N. flights in Angola
now had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said he was outraged that a second U.N.
-chartered aircraft was shot down in Angola over UNITA held territory
within eight days.
</P>
<P>
The plane which was rented from South Africa's Transafrik corporation
took off from
Huambo airport at 15:00 pm Saturday and was heading for the capital Luanda.
 There were eight people aboard, four of them were U.N. officials while the
rest were the crew members.
</P>
<P>
On December 26 of last year, a U.N. C-130 transport plane was downed
near Huambo city. So far, no one knows if there is any survivor among the
ten on board the plane or the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has called on the Angolan government and the UNITA to
offer their cooperation so as to enter the site. Diallo said the U.N. was
trying to obtain government and UNITA assistance in the search and rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
The downing of the two U.N. planes comes as Angola's peace accord
unravels and the oil- and diamond-rich southern African country resumes its
civil war which started with independence from Portugal in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says Arab Consultations Underway for Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Sunday that consultations are underway among Arab
countries on the planned Arab foreign ministers meeting scheduled
for later this month.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that he and a number of Arab foreign
ministers held a meeting in Egypt Saturday on the issue. He did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted well-informed sources as
saying that Moussa and his counterparts of Oman, Saudi Arabia,
Syria and Yemen met in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada, 400
kilometers southeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The five-way meeting was aimed at reaching a general agreement
among Arab countries on issues to be raised at the upcoming
foreign ministers meeting, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that intensive discussions of the kind will
continue in the upcoming stage to seek good preparations for the
meeting and examine the current situation in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries planned initially to hold a foreign ministers
meeting to discuss a Yemeni call for an emergency Arab summit on
the Iraqi issue after the recent U.S.-Britain military strikes on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Requested by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries,
Arab states agreed last Monday to put off the proposed meeting to
January 24.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Claims of Stalling Peace in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Sunday denied claims by
Zimbabwean press that it was stalling efforts to end fighting in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The South African Foreign Affairs Department said in a statement
it would do nothing that would encourage the forces in conflict which might
have any effect of undermining the peace process in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
"In so doing the government has been acutely aware that any delay in
bringing about a negotiated solution to the conflict could have disastrous
consequences, not only for the economic reconstruction and development of
the DRC, but for the well-being of all the inhabitants of our continent,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Congolese rebel forces were an important element
which
could not be excluded from the cease-fire if an end to the hostilities was
to be ensured.
</P>
<P>
"This, however, does not amount to elevating rebels to heads of state,
according them VIP treatment, or undermining the sovereignty of the DRC
government as alleged in the Zimbabwean press," it added.
</P>
<P>
The South African government remained committed in assisting all
international efforts aimed at bringing lasting peace in Congo (K) at the
earliest possible moment.
</P>
<P>
"Only all-inclusive negotiations involving all parties to the conflict
can ensure lasting peace in the DRC," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Congo (K) erupted in August last year when rebels,
being
supported by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, tried to topple the government
headed by President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
South African leaders, together with their African counterparts, have
been trying to mediate between the warring sides, but no efficient results
have
been achieved yet.

<P>
CAIRO, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Following are the economic briefs
from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Heavy rains over last week in Morocco raised
expectations that the country's grain output would be higher this
season.
</P>
<P>
After this season's profuse rains, the farm land area is
expected to expand from the current 7.5 million acres to 10
million acres.
</P>
<P>
It was predicted that Morocco's 1998 to 1999 harvest would
decrease to 4 million tonnes from 6.35 million tonnes last season
due to the dry weather.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government earmarked 4 billion pounds
(1.2 billion U.S. dollars) of loans to farmers at a 10 percent
interest rate over 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Khidre, president of the Credit and Agricultural
Development Bank said in a statement that the loans come within
the new facilities of lending offered by the bank's branches
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as being in favor of animal husbandry, fishing
and poultry entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordanians were caught by an unexpected shortage of
liquefied gas though officials with the Jordan Petroleum Refinery
Company are trying their best to meet the public demand.
</P>
<P>
Relief to the situation is expected Wednesday when 40,000
tonnes of liquefied gas, ordered from Greece, arrives at the
Aqaba harbor in southern Jordan, Minister of Energy Hani Mulki
was quoted as saying by the national daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied rumors that liquefied gas supplies from
Iraq, the only oil and natural gas source of the kingdom
following the 1991 Gulf War, was affected by the U.S.-British air
attack on Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan does not face a problem with Iraq concerning gas and
Iraqi officials are very understanding of Jordan`s situation", the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company just
received 37,000 tonnes of liquefied gas from Iraq, and employees
at gas stations are working 24 hours a day to meet the need of
some desperate Jordanians who are queuing up outside gas stations
with empty cylinders in the freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
The company had attributed the sudden shortage of liquefied
gas to the current cold wave sweeping the kingdom, where daily
consumption of liquefied gas soared to 1,250 tonnes a day from 500
to 550 tonnes a day under normal circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Says Preparation Essential for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said on Sunday that good preparation is
essential for an Arab summit aimed at discussing critical issues
in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Consultations are underway among Arab leaders in this respect,
Abdel-Meguid told a press conference held here with Boutros Boutros
Ghali, secretary general of the Francophone Organization.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome holding this summit," which is agreed upon by the
Arab leaders, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kuwait has informed him about its decision to
attend the Arab foreign ministers meeting scheduled to be convened
on January 24.
</P>
<P>
There is no sign at present that the meeting will be delayed
once again, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries planned to convene a foreign ministers meeting
last Wednesday to discuss the recent U.S-British military attack
on Iraq. Requested by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
countries, the meeting was put off last Monday to January 24.
</P>
<P>
Boutros Ghali said the Francophone Organization could cooperate
with the Arab League to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
"What matters now is the Iraqi people who suffer the
consequences of the crippling economic and political sanctions,"
Boutros Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed the trade embargo
on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed with Abdel-Meguid economic, diplomatic and
cultural cooperation between their two organizations, adding that
he has invited Arab League to attend a Francophone conference on
investments and foreign trade to be held in Monaco in April.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid has agreed to send an observer to the conference,
Boutros Ghali said, stressing that both organizations have the
desire to cooperate for the interests of their member states.

<HEADLINE> OAU Won't Militarily Intervene Congo Conflicts: Salim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Africa Unity
(OAU) Sunday ruled out the possibility of using military forces to end
conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim made the remarks
here when interviewed by the Dar es Salaam Television (DTV) that use of
military force in the central African nation will flare up the war
uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
He said the only lasting solution to the conflicts in DRC is to broaden
a political ground where every interested party in the conflicts could be
given a chance to participate in promoting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Relevant parties should be given chances to express their security
concerns, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if OAU principle on non-intervention in sovereign states could be
written off from the OAU charter to make way for countries to intervene in
situation like that of the DRC, Salim said that could be more dangerous to
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the provision is a cornerstone of OAU, and scrapping it from
the OAU charter would mean allowing big powers to intervene in small
nations'
affairs at will.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief, however, noted that maintenance of the principle is not
a certificate of acceptability for rulers in some African countries who
would do whatever they like.
</P>
<P>
Questioned about how long OAU should wait for negotiations on the DRC
conflicts to bear fruits, Salim said he hoped the current efforts made by
OAU would gear up the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Salim said although he wished peace could prevail in the vast central
African country, peace might be achieved longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on human rights violation in the continent, the
OAU chief said the situation of human rights agenda in the continent is
gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
"There is a big change. The press is now dynamic and independent and
that there is a vivid sensitization of people to their human rights," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the resolution to introduce a human rights court in Africa
passed by OAU was yet another example of Africa's commitment to observance
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
On whether OAU was financially sound to set up the court, Salim said
Africa could not make financial constraints an excuse for not starting the
important court.
</P>
<P>
Some countries in Africa have shown an interest in instituting the
court and some of them have even expressed desires to foot initial bills,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges U.N. to Take Measures against UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia Foreign Ministry Sunday in
a statement strongly condemned Angola's UNITA guerilla group for
shooting down another U.N. plane in the Angolan skies on Sunday,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side insistently demands that the United Nations
immediately react to these outrageous actions of UNITA. The
Security Council must use against this organization resolute and
utterly rigorous measures allowed by the U.N. Charter," the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in the last few days that UNITA (the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), shot down a
U.N. plane over Angola.
</P>
<P>
"This terrorist act is particularly outrageous because only two
days have passed since the U.N. Security Council demanded that the
UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi, make an immediate investigation into
an incident in which a U.N. aeroplane was shot down in December
and take urgent measures to find out what had happened to the crew
and passengers of the plane, who included two Russian citizens,"
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Six civilian aeroplanes have lately been shot down over the
territory controlled by UNITA. It, the ministry said, "is evidence
that this antigovernment group is in effect pursuing a systematic
line against the entire international community."
</P>
<P>
The victims are "citizens of various countries, including
Russia, and it is still unknown what has happened to them."
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, there had been no
Russians aboard the craft.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Calls for More African-American Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambian president Frederick Chiluba Sunday
called on African-American investors to help their African brothers and
sisters by investing more in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when Cyrhia Mckinney, U.S. congress woman from the
city of Atlanta, paid a courtesy call on him.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Zambia needs investment from African-Americans in
order to cement the relationship which already exists between Zambia and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Zambia is a heaven of peace and tranquility as no
investor will take his investment in chaos.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has reached a critical point in the economy after the
liberalization, and has experienced a lot of retrenchments because the new
owners of companies want to make them more viable.
</P>
<P>
The privatization, he said, has caused some social and political
problems in his country and reduced living standard of some people.
</P>
<P>
Mckinney told Chiluba that before coming to Zambia she held discussions
with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Africa and Zambia in particular.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with President Clinton that the United States policy in Africa
has not been as it should be," she said.
</P>
<P>
She called for more support to Zambia from the the U.S. government,
adding that Zambia should be supported for its efforts in
democratization.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants partnership with Africa based on dignity and
cooperation and improved relations with Africa through business ties, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
Mckinney also praised Zambia for its peace efforts in the war-torn
Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola.

KUWAIT CITY, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Sunday that an ICRC sub-committee
meeting to discuss the issue of Kuwaiti and third country's
prisoners of war (POWs) was indefinitely postponed because the
Iraqis refused to show up.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Pfefferle, regional delegate of the ICRC, said the
meeting of the technical sub-committee, which was scheduled to be
held Monday on the Kuwaiti side of the border with Iraq, would not
take place, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting has been indefinitely put off," Pfefferle said.
</P>
<P>
He said the "Iraqi authorities has informed the ICRC that the
Iraqi delegation will not be participating in the 37th session of
the technical sub-committee."
</P>
<P>
"The ICRC was in the process of clarifying the reason of such
non-participation," Pfefferle said.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC-sponsored sub-committee is composed of Iraq on one
side, the United States, Britain, France, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
on the other.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insisted that Iraq still holds more than 600 Kuwaiti
and third country's detainees since the end of the 1990 Gulf
War. But Baghdad has repeatedly denied that it held any POWs of
any country.

KAMPALA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Police Boss Cossy Odomel, who
has announced his plan to resign soon, said that he was forced by
President Yoweri Museveni to step down.
</P>
<P>
He made this remarks Saturday when interviewed by the New Vision
newspaper, which was published by the newspaper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Odomel said he was directed to resign from the top police post by the
appointing authority on the top of which is the president.
</P>
<P>
Hel did not specify the reasons for the directive although there is
speculation that the president acted on a corruption probe report about him.
</P>
<P>
Police Commander of Kampala Region Extra, Benjamin Namanya told Xinhua
Sunday morning in a telephone interview that he was greatly shocked at the
police boss' announcement at the party hosted Friday here to entertain
senior police commanders.
</P>
<P>
"I did not expect that at the time. Odomel just said he would quit his
job and live a civilian life. He did not say anything about what he would
do after resigning," Namanya said.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision report said the police boss is running businesses which
are supplying items to the police force.
</P>
<P>
He is alleged to have been a signatory to all payments and his
companies were always paid earlier than other suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The Inspector General of Government has since October 1998 been probing
Odomel's alleged amassing of wealth estimated at two billion shillings (two
million U.S. Dollars), but he said he had not seen any report on alleged
abuse of office.
</P>
<P>
This is shocking news to Ugandans following exposure of big scandals in
the privatization of parastatals in which one minister has resigned and
another is likely to face censure from the Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Attracts Over 4 Bln Dollars of Foreign Investment in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 260 foreign-invested
projects with combined capital of 4.058 billion U.S. dollars were
granted licenses in Vietnam in 1998, Vietnam news agency reported
Monday, quoting the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI).
</P>
<P>
In addition, 133 on-going projects were permitted to increase
their investment capital by 769 million U.S. dollars, bringing the
country's total investment capital licensed last year to over 4.8
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of projects and the amount of foreign
investment capital in Vietnam in 1998 dropped by 21.5 percent and
10.1 percent respectively compared to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Among 29 countries and regions investing in Vietnam last year,
Russia ranked first in terms of investment capital with 2 billion
dollars, followed by Singapore, which registered 893 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sectors that attracted large foreign investment in 1998
included the oil and gas industry with four projects worth 1.358
billion dollars, hotel and tourism with six projects capitalized
at 810.4 million dollars, heavy industry with 40 projects valued
at 551.3 million dollars, transport, communications and post with
12 projects worth 366.2 million dollars, and light industry with
54 projects worth 202.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Operating foreign-invested projects' total turnover last year
reached 3 billion dollars, a 27.6 percent increase over 1997, and
their export value was 2 billion dollars, a year-on-year rise of
11.7 percent. These projects created 269,500 jobs and contributed
320 million dollars to the state budget, a growth of 1.6 percent
over 1997.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on Plane Crash in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
is expected to meet behind closed doors at 5:00 p.m. EST Monday to
discuss two U.N. planes downed in Angola in eight days, U.N.
officials announced.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to brief the
15-nation council on what is going on in Angola, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The council's closed-door meeting came after the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was reported to
shoot down a U.N.-chartered cargo plane Saturday, the second
United Nations plane apparently attacked in Angola's central
highland war zone in eight days.
</P>
<P>
The C-130 aircraft, with eight people aboard, was hit by
anti-aircraft fire 20 minutes after it took off from the city of
Huambo, about 480 kilometers southeast of the Angolan capital of
Luanda.
</P>
<P>
However, UNITA denied that it downed the plane.
</P>
<P>
The plane that crashed Saturday was carrying U.N. equipment out
of Huambo. Last week, the United Nations evacuated dozens of staff
members from the city after it was briefly shelled by the
advancing rebels.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has condemned the rebels for failing
to help the United Nations determine the fate of crash victims and
has signaled it may take unspecified action against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Annan, who said he was "outraged" by the
accidents, reiterated the appeals for the Angolan government and
rebels to assist in rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
"All threats to U.N. personnel -- in the air and on the ground
-- must cease immediately," Annan said in a statement, urging both
sides to observe an immediate cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
UNITA stymied the implementation of the 1994 peace pact by
refusing to surrender the control of its central highland
strongholds and by keeping a 30,000-strong army hidden in the
bush.
</P>
<P>
The accord unraveled in December when government troops tried
to take the strongholds by force and were beaten back. Recent
battles have focused around Huambo, the provincial capital which
is 150 kilometers away from the crash site.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Deputy PM to Visit Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime
Minister Abdel Aziz Al-Dekheel will pay a visit to Jordan Tuesday,
marking a further step to the normalization of Kuwaiti-Jordanian
ties.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dekheel, also Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs, will
meet with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan and convey him a letter on
bilateral ties from his Kuwaiti counterpart Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister will be the highest-ranking Kuwaiti
official to visit Jordan since the Kuwaiti-Jordanian ties soured
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, when Amman, along with a
few other Arab states, sided with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
A rapprochement process between the two sides began in May
1997 when Kuwait declared it would like to "improve ties with all
Arab countries except Iraq".
</P>
<P>
Since then the two countries have exchanged a number of
middle-level visits.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah said on Sunday that he had invited his
Jordanian counterpart Abdul Ilah al-Khatib to visit Kuwait, the
strongest signal so far that the ties between the two countries
will be resumed very soon.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Deploys More Troops in Niger Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has deployed more
troops in the oil-producing Niger Delta areas where youth protests are
threatening oil production, media reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Bayelsa were quoted as saying that many military check-
points had been installed while armored personnel carriers patrolled
Bayelsa State.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Yenagoa, capital of Bayelsa State, said that the government
deployed more troops in Niger Delta Sunday and two naval vessels crossed
into the waters of the area at the weekend with combat ready personnel on
board.
</P>
<P>
A source said that 10 military tanks and several police armored
personnel carriers had been moved in to help end the four-day crisis which
had claimed at least 20 lives.
</P>
<P>
"A further reinforcement of troops is being expected from the army
barracks in Emele, Port Harcourt," the source added.
</P>
<P>
The Bayelsa State police commissioner, Nahum Eli, said at the weekend
that the state police command had closed two police stations to avoid an
imminent violent clash between the police and youths in the state,
according to a Daily Times report Monday.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out in the area last Wednesday following the expiration
of December 30 ultimatum given to the Nigerian government by the Ijaw
youths.
</P>
<P>
Bayelsa State Administrator Paul Obi declared a state of
emergency in the state following three people were killed by government
troops during a confrontation on December 30.
</P>
<P>
The youth in Bayelsa State held a meeting on December 11 and issued the
"Kaiama Declaration" , demanding the withdrawal of security force sent to
protect oil installations in the area and the stoppage of oil exploration
and exploitation activities by oil companies until the ownership and
control of the coast oil deposits is determined.

<HEADLINE> Tax Collectors Achieve Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji recently
congratulated more than one million local tax collectors for
achieving the national target for increasing last year's annual
tax revenues by 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu praised the efforts in a recent letter to the State
Administration of Taxation (SAT). He said tax officers
successfully achieved the goal under "difficult objective
conditions" by strengthening taxation management, plugging
loopholes, rendering punishment for corrupt practices and clearing
tax payments due in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
SAT statistics released today show that China collected 855.1
billion yuan in tax revenues from the industrial and commercial
sectors, up 13.3 percent or 100.3 billion yuan on 1997.
</P>
<P>
Total revenues, domestic value-added tax and consumer taxes hit
455.3 billion yuan, up 12.5 percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The successful results quelled earlier fears that China would
face difficulty in achieving its annual tax collection target due
to the negative impact of the financial crisis engulfing many part
of Asia and devastating summer flooding in many parts of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The central government introduced to render severe punishment
for illegal tax practices, with local taxation departments
strengthening efforts to collect overdue taxes owned by
debt-ridden companies and thwart tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Local governments work diligently to collect overdue taxes from
local firms and enhance general public awareness of the importance
of taxation in terms of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Tax revenues grew on a monthly basis during the second half of
last year, especially for the November-December period when
revenues hit 191.2 billion yuan and accounted for 22.4 percent of
the annual total.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of industrial and commercial 1998 tax revenues to
gross domestic product stood at 10.7 percent, up 0.7 percent on
the previous year.

<HEADLINE> OAU Urges African Countries to Fight HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 ADDIS ABABA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Monday called on all African heads of state and government to
formulate a plan of action to fight the
AIDS disease.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Ambassador Ahmed Haggag, OAU Assistant Secretary
General, at the opening session of a two-day colloquium on the challenge
of HIV/AIDS in Africa, which was held at the Africa Hall here.
</P>
<P>
Haggag stressed that multi-sectoral committee should be set up in each
member state with national budgetary allocations in order to effectively
coordinate all programs and activities aimed at implementing the OAU Dakar
(1992) and Tunis (1994) declarations on HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that programs to control further spread of HIV and to
take care of those affected by AIDS should be country-driven rather than
donor-driven.
</P>
<P>
"Governments should encourage the mass media, schools and religiours
leaders to provide free information against HIV/AIDS to all communities
especially in rural areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session, Klint Nyamur Yekung'e, the Joint
United Nations
programs on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) country program adviser, said Monday that
out of a total of 5.8 million who acquired the infection in 1998 worldwide,
4.0 million live in Africa south of Sahara.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the epidemic began, 34 million Africans have been
infected, and almost 12 million of them have died.
</P>
<P>
 The two-day meeting is organized by the Mother and Child African
Relief Organization, which is a non-governmental organization in special
consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, Africa will be confronted with 20 million of her
children infected by HIV, according to the Mother and Child African Relief
Organization.

<HEADLINE> India Prepared to Face Widening Trade Deficit:Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government was
prepared to face the widening trade deficit which had reached 6.7
billion U.S. dollars during April-November last year, Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen the trend so far," Sinha told reporters, adding
that "We are prepared ourselves" for a widened trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinha refused to specify any figure concerning the
trade imbalance at the year-end, saying he would not hazard a
guess against various estimates that had come so far.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit for the first eight months of the current
fiscal year which began on April 1, 1998 was officially estimated
at 6.7 billion U.S. dollars, which is more than double that of 3.3
billion U.S. dollars in the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data, India's exports during the
eight-month period were estimated at 21.5 billion U.S. dollars, or
3.97 percent less than 22.36 billion U.S. dollars registered in
April-November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Imports were put at 28.2 billion U.S. dollars, 9.5 percent
higher than 25.7 billion U.S. dollars in the same period 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the increasing gold import was the main reason for the
widening trade deficit and the government was looking ways to curb
it.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the fiscal deficit was under pressure and said
he was trying to keep it as close to the budget estimate of 5.6
percent of the Gross Domestic Product as possible.

 JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's efforts to fight
the
millennium bug are being hampered by the growing brain drain of computer
professionals, the latest issue of Intelligence, the magazine for members
of the computer society of South Africa, said.
</P>
<P>
Many computer specialists with Y2K skills, including Y2K project
managers are being lured overseas by high salaries.They are leaving South
Africa in pursuit of opportunities overseas and to get away from spiralling
crime, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Madhi, Chief Executive of Pretoria's Y2K Decision Support
Center, was quoted as noting that there is a "trek of skills".
 The brain drain is posing a problem for those working against computer
catastrophe when the clock ticks over to January 1, 2000.
Madhi said the areas which were most likely to be affected were small and

<HEADLINE> Property Value Goes up in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Over estimation of property value and
the pegging of property rentals to the U.S. Dollar has resulted in an
average of
30 percent increase in property values in 1998 particularly in the capital
city of Lusaka, Times of Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a real property consultant as saying that because
of the slumping property market and the construction industry as well as a
40
percent depreciation of the country's currency Kwacha in the year, most
landlords have overestimated the value of their properties without
consulting qualified valuation surveyors.
</P>
<P>
 Managing partner of Bitrust Real Estate Consult, Holand Mulenga said
because of this trend tenacy defaults on rental payment increased by a
wide margin during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Giving a preview of the property market in Zambia, he said
tire dollarization of property rentals by most landlords in the country is
due to the constant fall of the Kwacha and the desire by most property
owners to stabilize their investment.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that charging rent in Dollars is not a fool proof
hedge
against fluctuating investment returns on property.
</P>
<P>
"Tenants also derive their incomes from the same economically weak
investment environment, and 90 percent of potential customers earn their
incomes in Kwacha and so will have the same difficulties in raising the
dollar rental demands,"he said.
</P>
<P>
 The trend in 1998 saw most property owners concentrating on the drive
for maximum rental income returns without commensurate rise in the level of
maintenance of property, he said,
</P>
<P>
 Mulenga noted that property owners in Zambia should not expect rentals
to
keep rising in the new year due to a fall in effective demand in real
property.
</P>
<P>
 He urged the property owners to increase investment in 1999 in
property maintenance to achieve a positive growth.

<HEADLINE> China Lists Licensed Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China has sharply reduced the
number of licensed export commodities in an effort to boost
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
recently announced that 58 export products, or half the 115
products in 1998, will be subject to licensing administration
during 1999. In addition, the number of commodity codes will be
reduced from 707 to 395.
</P>
<P>
The new list consists of commodities exported to certain
countries and regions, as well as fresh crab, livestock and
poultry exports to Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Designated departments will license part of the listed
commodities for entry through designated customs areas.
</P>
<P>
A MOFTEC official noted that the move is a major part of
China's reform on administration of exports during 1999. He said
the move will help increase China's exports, streamline
application procedure and standardize order in the export
sector.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Release More Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran will set free 776 Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs) in the coming days, said Deputy Speaker of
Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) Ajeel Jalal Ismaail on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ismaail and his delegation have just returned home after a
four-day visit to Tehran at the invitation of Iranian Majlis
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
He told the Iraqi News Agency that the Iranian parliament
decided to release 400 Iraqi POWs in appreciation of the Iraqi
parliamentary delegation's visit, apart from what was agreed on by
the technical committees between Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Ismaail said Iran would set free another 376 Iraqi POWs in the
coming days according to the agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iraqi delegation held talks with Iranian
parliamentary members as well as governmental officials on
expanding relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the U.S.-British air strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain raided Iraq for four consecutive
nights on December 16-19 in an operation code-named "Desert Fox,"
which was condemned by the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has long stood on the way of normalization
between Iraq and Iran, two former foes that fought an eight-year
war in the 1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing began trading in the
euro today on the first banking day following introduction of the
new currency.
</P>
<P>
Nine outlets operated by the Beijing Branch of the Bank of
China (BOC), China's leading foreign currency bank, recorded 39
transactions with U.S. dollars used to purchase 557,000 euros.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by BOC's Beijing Branch also indicated that 15
individuals opened euro accounts on Monday, with the total number
of related euro accounts rising to 16 since the formal launch of
the new currency.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Branch also reported two euro remittance
transactions today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, three companies have opened euro accounts with the
Beijing Branch of BOC so far.
</P>
<P>
"While there are certainly risks involving the foreign exchange
rate, opening a euro account will greatly simply our European
business settlements and it will reduce costs for exchanges,"
according to Ba Ping, an accountant with China-Schindler Elevator
Co. Limited. The China-Schindler was the first company to open a
euro account with the branch.
</P>
<P>
Ba said the company's annual export volume of elevator parts to

ISLAMABAD, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz
said Monday that Pakistan and the U.S. will discuss a five-point
non-proliferation agenda during U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott's visit early next month.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Parliament lobby, Aziz said the two

Ban Treaty, the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty, deployment of
nuclear weapons, export control and the Pakistan-India ties with
special reference to the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the Nuclear Regulatory Authority bill would be
introduced in the National Assembly within six to eight weeks to
tighten control over exports of nuclear technology and sensitive
materials to a third country.
</P>
<P>
An autonomous body will be set up with the participation of
Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and other related institutions
to deal with the nuclear program, he added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also said he was sending letters to member countries of
the G-8 (Group of Eight) to convey Pakistan's serious concern over
the recent defense deal between Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
There is a need to control the arms race rather than inking
more deals for the spread of traditional weapons, he said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Produces 2m Karat of Diamond in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Angola yielded two million karats of
diamond
 in 1998, with a value of 450 million U.S. Dollars, the major source of
income for the mineral sector, the Ministry of Geology and Mines revealed
in a
document.
 The document available here Monday said that the figure represents a 65
percent
growth over 1997, when Angola produced 1.314 million karats of diamond, with
a value of 350 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the diamond sector is regaining its vigor from
decline
and standstill for many years, the ministry document said.
</P>
<P>
 Angola had registered its record high diamond production of 2.41
million karats,
ranking the fourth in the world diamond-producing nations, but its
production saw
a sharp decline in the decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
 The ministry is implementing its plans to revitalize the
diamond industry and absorb more foreign investment, so as to make the
industry contribute more to the restoration of the national economy, the
document said.
</P>
<P>
 The ministry is still concerned over the re-start of military
conflicts in
some parts of the country, which may hinder the plans implementation and
the inflow of investment from abroad, it said.
</P>
<P>
 It said that about half of the diamonds produced in 1998 are still in
the
hands of smuggler groups, including the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) .

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The euro began its first day of
trading in Thailand on Monday but had little impact on markets
here or in the rest of the region, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The unit was selling at 42.58-84 Thai baht in early trade and
the buying of euro here was very light, according to the dealers.
</P>
<P>
Because of the strength of the European unit, the baht was
trading stronger at 36.27-34 to the U.S. dollar, compared to
36.60-65 on the last day of trade in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Japanese yen might be pushed back to third
position as the currency of choice with respect to the euro's
arrival.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have been pushing the yen aggressively as an
alternative to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Although the trade of euro was light, traders would be watching
the unit closely.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's central bank said it would change a chunk of its
foreign exchange reserves into the new Europe currency.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank here will gradually convert its assets in
Deutsch marks, French francs and other European currencies into
the euro," said Assistant Bank of Thailand governor Kiatisak
Meecharoen.
</P>

"Those holdings together account for about 10 percent of
foreign currency holdings," he said.

The survey also indicated respondents were satisfied with
China's abundant labor resources, vast market potential,
preferential policy for overseas investors, related laws and
stable prices.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Hit by Textile Smugglers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 4 (Xinhua) - Tanzania suffers a loss of billions
of Tanzanian Shillings (one U.S. Dollar equals to 680 Shillings) annually
in
revenue from textile smuggling, a national newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mail newspaper quoted a report by the Textile Manufacturers
Association of Tanzania (TMAT) as saying that tax evasion and smuggling
have been the major cause leading to a total collapse of the domestic
textile sector.
</P>
<P>
The report, addressed to the government last week, disclosed the
techniques used by the textile importers to evade taxes.
</P>
<P>
The TMAT said that under the transit route technique most of the Duty
Entitlement Pass Book documents indicate that the consignments originate
from Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, and the destination port usually is
Zanzibar or Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
It elaborates that on receiving the merchandise mostly from India, the
agents in Dubai would re-ship the cargo to countries neighboring Tanzania
via Dar es Salaam Port.
</P>
<P>
"The goods would then be falsely declared at Dar es Salaam port and
cleared by the use of transit entries. The papers would then be taken to
the border entry points for stamping by Tanzania Revenue Authority
officials there," the report said.

It added that the transit entry documents were then brought back to
Customs Department in Dar es Salaam for bond cancellation, while the goods
found their way into the local market virtually free of tax.
</P>
<P>
"Under this technique the Exchequer is totally denied of any revenue
and the domestic industry virtually robbed of its legitimate market share. "
</P>
<P>
Besides the transit route technique, textile importers have evaded tax
by importing goods into the Mainland through Zanzibar by under declaration
of the quantity of the goods and their price value.
</P>
<P>
"The Mombasa-Sirari-Mwanza and Mombasa-Kisumu-Mwanza routes have also
been used to evade tax by textile importers," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan PM Condemns Mass Killing in Central Punjab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Monday strongly condemned the killing of 16 faithfuls in
central Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said 16 Shia worshippers were killed and more
than 20 others injured Monday morning during an armed attack by
four masked men at Imambargah near the central Punjab town of
Muzaffargarh.
</P>
<P>
"The government is fully determined to weed out terrorism from
the country," Sharif said in a condolence message.
</P>
<P>
Sharif instructed the Punjab government and district
administration not to leave any stone unturned to nab the
culprits.
</P>
<P>
He said Muslims cannot even imagine the "devilish act of
shedding the blood of innocent people during the holy month of
Ramadan. But some anti-state elements are carrying out these
nefarious acts to create instability in the country for their
ulterior motives."
</P>
<P>
These "anti-state elements" cannot escape punishment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the basic obligation of the government to provide
security and protection to the life and property of the citizens.
"We will fully exploit our resources for this purpose," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bjorkman Beats Gambill in Hopman Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two teams split the singles matches, but Bjorkman and
teammate Asa Carlsson were too strong in the mixed doubles,
winning in straight sets to clinch the tie, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman is aiming to rejuventate his singles career this
year, having slipped to No. 24 in the rankings after reaching a
high of four in 1997, and looked in great touch with the
Australia Open less than a month away.
</P>
<P>
He was far too strong for American Jan-Michael Gambill, ranked
38th in the world, in the singles, winning 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman then carried that form through to the mixed doubles,
controlling play and covering plenty of court to win 7-6 (7-2)
6-4.
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 Lindsay Davenport had earlier got the Americans
off to a flying start by downing Carlsson 6-2, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman, 26, said he had been having troubles with his right
hamstring in recent weeks and hadn't expected to find touch so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
"I even surprised myself," he said."I played really well in
singles and mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great way to start 1999."
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old American didn't help his cause with five
double faults and didn't have a break point in either set.
</P>
<P>
The mixed doubles result was a great relief to Carlsson, who
hadn't won a match in her two previous visits to Perth, having
lost four doubles matches and four singles matches.
</P>
<P>
She earlier lost her fifth singles match when Davenport gave
the United States a perfect start, overpowering the 92nd ranked
Carlsson in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Davenport said she was delighted with the way she hit the ball
in her first match for six weeks, but commended the Swedes for
their performance in the mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
The United States now face Switzerland in their next Group B
match, while Sweden meets the Slovak Republic.
</P>
<P>
The late match tonight is between France and Spain.

<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 4 (xinhua) -- Rebels in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) reportedly sent an envoy to Uganda to represent
their interests in the land-locked east African country.
</P>
<P>
This move prompted the security to deploy policemen to guard the
embassy of the DRC in Uganda, the New vision reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
 But an official in the Information Department of the Foreign Affairs
Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Xinhua Monday morning
that she could not confirm that because she had not heard of it .
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the DRC envoy, Gaston Mubawa Kengere, as saying
here Sunday that he was appointed as representative plenipotentiary to
Kampala and that another representative was also appointed to Kigali,
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He said that an office is soon to be opened here to aid whoever
wants to travel to eastern DRC.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been accused of backing DRC rebels fighting to
oust DRC president Laurent kabila. At present there is no end to fighting
in sight, because none of the countries who deployed troops in that
country agreed to withdraw its troops first.

<HEADLINE> New Group Formed in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Afghan
president Sibghatullah Mujaddedi and chief of National Islamic
Front of Afghanistan (NIFA) Pir Syed Gillani have formed a new
group with the aim of achieving an immediate cease-fire and
restoring peace to their war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Monday at the residence of
Mujaddedi, they announced the formation of "Associated for Peace
and National Unity in Afghanistan, aimed at bringing peace in
Afghanistan and halting the on-going war through rapprochement
among the warring Afghan factions.
</P>
<P>
"Our effort has been supported by a number of Afghan
organizations, political and religious groups, important
personalities, intellectuals and others," they claimed, adding:
"We have also been assured of cooperation by these people."
</P>
<P>
Mujaddedi said that since the troops of the former Soviet Union
withdrew from Afghanistan, the Afghans have not seen calm yet in
their country.
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, this blood-letting continued in Afghanistan and if
a serious effort was not made to stop it, it seems to me that it
will devour generation after generation of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The increasing agonies and torment faced by the Afghans in the
wake of war have compelled us to take a new initiative to create a
peaceful and a livable atmosphere in the war-torn country,"
Mujaddedi added.
</P>
<P>
Pir Gillani hoped that the Afghans will extend full support to
their efforts for peace. He said that despite being in control of
most of the Afghan territory by the Taliban, it is not possible
for them to provide basic needs to the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
Pir Gillani stressed the need for convening a Grand Girga
(assembly of people) of Afghans to decide the type of the future
system in Afghanistan. But Grand Girga cannot be held without
peace in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Mujaddedi said they were committed to
making efforts for the peace and hoped that the Afghan nation will
support them.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China has used overseas
funds of close to 4.7 billion US dollars for environmental
protection projects over the past three years, according to
today's China Economic Times.
</P>
<P>

Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission had approved the use
of overseas funds totaling 2.3 billion US dollars for 21
environmental protection projects by the end of 1998, the third
year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
An additional 19 projects involving 2.4 billion dollars were
approved during the early stage of preparations, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds have been used for the construction of
environmental protection infrastructure, pollution control and
developing the industry.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the sector note that the use of overseas funds
has injected substantial capital into China's environmental
programs and has helped transform the industry into a new economic
growth area.

<HEADLINE> China's Medical Experts Concerned at Growth of Sex Shops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Worried about the growing number
of sex shops, which are opening all over China, and their often
unprofessional practises, Chinese medical experts are calling for
a nationwide plan to bring order to the business.
</P>
<P>
There are no official statistics on the number of such shops
but they can now be found in cities and rural townships alike; in
the downtown areas of the bigger metropolises and in the
backstreets of remote counties.
</P>
<P>
China's huge 1.2 billion population has undoubtedly the
potential to become the world's largest market for sexually
related products.
</P>
<P>
But the absence of any national code of conduct or regulations
governing the burgeoning industry has resulted in chaos with
unlicensed sex shops opening up and many selling suspicious sex
aids.
</P>
<P>
"The fledgling sex health business, which can be a boon to
China in terms of population control, is doomed if such a trend is
left unchecked," cautioned Li Zeyou, a member of China's Sexuality
Society (CSS), which took part in a national medical seminar in
Hefei.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government should make hospitals,
health rehabilitation centers and special hospitals for
sex-related problems the main suppliers of sex health products
such as condoms and birth control pills. It should also issue
business licenses to sex shops to standardize their activities.
</P>
<P>
"Even grocery stores can be found selling condoms and
contraceptive pills, with prices varying from one yuan (about 0.82
U.S. cents) to ten yuan (1.25 U.S. dollars) apiece." added Li.
</P>
<P>
The executive chairman of the Society, Cao Xinwu, said: "What
also upsets a lot of people is that some drug stores display big
posters of naked men and women with erotic captions."
</P>
<P>
He added people's attitudes toward sex have changed a lot in
the last dozen or so years and he believes proper guidance has
become imperative. He stressed that the CSS will make every
efforts to ensure sex shops become more professional.

<HEADLINE> Euro Traded Actively in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The new currency, the euro, of the
European Union was actively traded in Bangladesh's local
inter-bank market on Monday, which ended with a strong note
against the local currency, the taka, the official BSS news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The taka was quoted at 58.95 against the euro at the close of
the trading, from 56.9 at the beginning of trading, the news
agency quoted dealers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahmudur Rahman, assistant vice president of the Arab
Bangladesh Bank, said he was the first local dealer to make an
inter-bank deal on the euro with the Standard Chartered Bank
(SCB).
</P>
<P>
The SCB, which had the largest dealing in euros with local and
foreign commercial banks here, had quoted over 1 million U.S.
dollars of trading in the new currency.
</P>
<P>
The euro was officially introduced on January 1 this year, but
came to the world money market trading on Monday (January 4) after
the New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Demand for the euro was high because the euro zone represents
30 percent of the world trading community and nearly 45 percent of
exports from Bangladesh goes to the euro zone, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Bank, the central bank, has issued instructions to
all commercial banks for smooth transaction of the new currency
and requested those facing difficulties in euro trading to contact
the bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, demand for the U.S. dollar remained steady at the
end of the trading and the greenback was quoted at 48.6500/48.6520
against the taka.

<HEADLINE> VietCombank Sets Vietnam Dong-Euro Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ho Chi Minh City branch of
VietCombank (Vietnam commercial bank) announced the Vietnamese
Dong (VND)-euro exchange rate over the weekend, Vietnam's English
daily the Saigon Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The purchasing price of Europe's new currency, which was
introduced on January 1, was set at 16,273 VND, and the selling
price, 16,339 VND.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's state bank, however, has yet to make any official
announcement although the international financial market has begun
to trade the euro.
</P>
<P>
Due to a lack of the VND-euro exchange rate set by the central
bank, the difference between the buying and selling prices of the
euro against the local currency quoted by VietCombank Ho Chi Minh
City was as high as VND 66.
</P>
<P>
Truong Van Phuoc, deputy director of VietCombank Ho Chi Minh
City, explained that his branch had allowed such a wide difference
because the dollar-euro exchange rate on the world market was
fluctuating all the time.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is hard for businesses to choose the euro for
payments.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has requested the government to allow banks to
settle payments in the euro.
</P>
<P>
EU (European Union) countries now account for 11 percent of
Vietnam's total foreign investment and 42 percent of official
development assistance (ODA).
</P>
<P>
Five of the 11 EU member countries are traditional business
partners of Vietnam. In 1997, Vietnam's exports to France, Italy
and Belgium were worth more than 1 billion U.S. dollars.

Yang said the Beijing lab had passed such test for 10 times in

<HEADLINE> Australia Dollar Ends Stronger As Euro Makes Its Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
a touch higher Monday after relinquishing center stage in local
trade to the debut of the euro - the world's first new currency in
three decades.
</P>
<P>
Attention was focused on Australia as the euro officially began
its first full trading day after being launched on January 1 as
the electronic currency of 11 of the 15 European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Australia had been expecting the privilege of being the first
to trade the euro when markets opened here Monday, but rare New
Year's Day trading in India grabbed that honor.
</P>
<P>
At the close of local trade, the Australian dollar was buying
61.47 U.S. cents compared with 61.43 late New Year's Eve in local
business.
</P>
<P>
The local unit spent the day between 61.14 and 61.49 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
At 5am Monday morning the euro was trading at 1.1744 U.S. cents
and ended at 1.1746.
</P>
<P>
The euro was buying 1.9162 Australian dollars in early trading
and finished at 1.9109.
</P>
<P>
MMS Standard &AMP; Poor's currency strategist Alex Douglas said the
Australian dollar spent the day range-bound as attention was
focused on the euro.
</P>
<P>
"First up this morning most people's attentions were focused on
the launch of the euro and once that was out of the way I guess
for the start of the new year people were not so keen to jump in
and set new positions in the Aussie.
</P>
<P>
"Particularly so with the trade data due out tomorrow - people
are a bit hesitant ahead of the trade data."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will release
the balance of goods and services trade for November.
</P>
<P>
Economists' forecasts center on a 900 million Australian
dollars (553.5 million U.S. dollars) deficit.
</P>
<P>
Douglas said the outlook for the Australian dollar over the
next 24 hours was dependent on Tuesday's trade data.
</P>
<P>
"If the trade deficit is smaller than expected then Aussie
could have some quite significant gains."
</P>
<P>
At the close of local trading, the Australian dollar was at
69.72 Japanese yen from 70.51 on New Year's eve. And it was buying
0.3680 British pounds from 0.3685.

It is estimated that for sale are some 300 kinds of books and

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has issued a final warning to all local
government officials in the Jaffna Peninsula to resign immediately
from their positions, informed sources here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Failure to do so would be punishable by death, according to the
warning.
</P>
<P>
Under this situation, government officials in the peninsula in
the country's Northern province were prepared for such an
eventuality, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has also warned other local officials not to have any
dealing with the government troops.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna peninsula was once the stronghold of the LTTE
rebels, who have been waging a 16-year war for a separate state in
the north and east of the island country.
</P>
<P>
Having lost the peninsula to government forces in May 1996,
they have been pushed into jungle hideouts from where they have
been launching attacks on government troops and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Later last month the LTTE gunned down the Tamil United
Liberation Front's Jaffna District Secretary Pon Mathimugarajah,
who was believed to be the next mayor of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE also assassinated two Jaffna mayors, Sarojini
Yogeswaran and P. Sivapalan, respectively in May and September
last year.

CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Following are the economic briefs
from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabian chemical and plastic industries
represent some 20 percent of the country's industrial production
and provide about 70 percent of the value of the country's
industrial exports.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a statistical report issued by the Saudi consultative
services agency, the Saudi Press Agency said Monday that the 616
chemical and plastic factories make up 19.8 percent of the 3,111
Saudi productive factories.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's foreign currency reserves reached 22.7
billion U.S. dollars in December, 1998, up 223 million dollars, or
nearly 1 percent, from 22.5 billion dollars in November, according
to the Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Overall foreign currency reserves grew by 2.37 billion dollars
in 1998 as the local currency shekel's relatively high interest
rates attracted investors from abroad.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- World-leading accounting firm Price Waterhouse
Coopers (PWC) intends to set up a 50-million-dollar fund in Israel
to invest in Israel's high-teach and life-science companies, PWC's
global managing partner Jermyn Brroks said in Tel Aviv on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the PWC is willing to invest 1 billion dollars a year,
of which some 500 million dollars would be spent on improving the
technological abilities of the company.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli government entered the new year of
1999 without a state budget as the budget bill failed to pass the
Knesset (parliament) in December, 1998. Accountant-general of the
Finance Ministry Shai Talmon said last week that the lack of a
budget for 1999 was a temporary setback and the nation could
survive January without one.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- All police forces in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines, have been placed on red alert following
a grenade explosion in Jolo, Sulu, last Saturday, which killed 10
people and wounded 74 others, the Philippine News Agency said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Director General Roberto T. Lastimoso, acting
chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), issued the order to
forestall any similar incident from happening.
</P>
<P>
Suspected members of the extremist Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG)
exploded a grenade inside a bakery in Downtown Jolo in an apparent
retaliation for the death of their leader, Abdurajak Janjalani, in
a gun battle with a police patrol in Basilan last December, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Lastimoso ordered PNP forces in General Santos City, Cotabato
City and Davao City to be very careful by stepping up their
intelligence gathering to detect any possible attack by Abu Sayyaf
members in their respective localities, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted the police chief as saying police visibility
in crowded areas must be maintained at all times to pre-empty
surprise attacks by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
All police forces in Mindanao must be alert and look for
possible presence of terrorists in their respective communities,
Lastimoso said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expected to Import Less Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is expected to
import less rice this year than last year's 2.14 million tons
despite the lingering La Nina weather phenomenon, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency Monday quoted Agriculture Secretary
William Dar as saying typhoons, which are expected to visit the
country during the first half of 1999, will not have a substantial
effect on the country's major crops.
</P>
<P>
Irrigated areas are ensured of enough water for the next four
months and thus, rice production is seen to increase by 30 to 50
percent this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to improve the self-sufficiency level of
grain from 92-96 percent to 98 percent to lower rice imports, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, should the 98 percent sufficiency level target is
attained, we may no longer import rice this year," Dar said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the agricultural sector is expected to recover
this year with a 2-3 percent growth rate from 1998's 1 percent
because of the El Nino and La Nina phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
He said the sector will be mainly spurred by increased rice and
corn output, poultry, livestock, coconut and fisheries sectors.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Banks Set Dinar-Euro Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's commercial banks
have set their initial Kuwaiti dinar-euro exchange rate, with
analysts predicting the new currency will eventually change the
dinar's exchange rate mechanism.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspapers published Monday, National Bank
of Kuwait offered Sunday to buy one euro for 0.35090 Kuwaiti dinar
(KD) and sell it for KD 0.35540 and Burgan Bank offered KD
0.351889 and KD 0.355245.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Bank will set its first euro-dinar rate Monday.
</P>
<P>
The present exchange rate for U.S. dollar and dinar in Kuwait's
banks is 1 to 0.2990 for buy-in and 1 to 0.3045 for sell-out.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti banks said that they were prepared to deal in euros and
they had received a number of calls from interested traders,
individuals and speculators.
</P>
<P>
As the euro will coexist with the national currencies until
they become fully obsolete in mid-2002, customers with Kuwaiti
banks are free to keep their legacy accounts or have them
converted into a euro account.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say the euro will affect trade between Kuwait
and European countries and ultimately affect the dinar exchange
rate mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Kuwait Economic Society Amer Al-Tameemi told
local daily the Kuwait Times that the euro will prompt the
Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) to change its exchange rate
mechanism, but stressed this would only be a "technical" change
and will not greatly affect the value of dinar.

Speaking before leaving for the United States, Jayasinghe said

found an experienced track and field coach for her.

harassment by a senior official and she didn't perform well at
Bangkok Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
She withdrew from the 100 and 200 meter events, citing injury

<HEADLINE> Increase in Agricultural Loans Boosts Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- There has been a sharp
increase in the number of farmers seeking loans from credit
cooperatives in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Most are used for agricultural schemes such as planting more
trees or undertaking water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
The increase is mainly attributed to the fact that the
land-contract policy in rural areas will remain unchanged for 30
years, which gives farmers a long tenure and encourages them to
invest in their land. The second round of allocating land
contracts has now been completed.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, agricultural credit cooperatives, in line with China's
banking policies, began to operate independently from the
Agricultural Bank of China and provide services solely to the
agricultural sector, which was then considered a poor market with
little potential.
</P>
<P>
Since then, there has been an impetus in the growth of small
towns and cities in the region due to the confirmed high status
given to agricultural activities throughout China and the State's
policy of increasing domestic demand, according to the Chongqing
Rural Economic Restructuring Office.
</P>
<P>
Credit cooperatives have now decided to expand their services
to include more infrastructure projects such as roads, electricity
grids and commercial housing.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai ordered Monday morning the Israel Defense Force
(IDF) to impose an immediate curfew on and a closure of
Hebron, following attacks on Jewish settlers in the city, the
army said.
</P>
<P>
Unknown gunmen opened fire Monday morning at a bus the
Jewish settlers were riding in Hebron, and two women settlers
were hit by bullets, one of them seriously, the army said.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister is receiving constant reports of the
situation in Hebron and directing the actions of the IDF and
other Israeli security forces in and around the city, the army
added.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister has ordered the immediate curfew and
closure of the city to prevent the situation in Hebron from
further worsening, the army added.
</P>
<P>
The army believed that the gunmen were Palestinians and the
IDF and other Israeli security force are conducting a manhunt
for the attackers, the army said.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is situated in the south of the West Bank. The
majority population of the city are Palestinians, but there are
45 Jewish families living in the city with heavy protection of
the IDF.
</P>
<P>
Clashes and confrontations occurred quite often in the city
between the Palestinians and Jewish settlers in the past.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Israeli settler Rabbi Shlomo Ra'anan was stabbed
to death at his home in the city.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Invited to Visit Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul
Ilah Al-Khatib has received an invitation from his Kuwaiti
counterpart Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah to visit the Gulf
emirate to end strains in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times Wednesday quoted Al-Khatib as
saying that he had received a message from Sheikh Sabah, inviting
him to visit Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Such a visit would officially end the strains in bilateral
relations which were severed following the 1990 Gulf Crisis,
Sheikh Sabah was quoted as saying by news agencies in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides has not set a specific date for the
visit.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, along with a few other Arab nations, sided with Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian embassy in Kuwait has been closed since then,
but the Kuwaiti mission in Amman headed by a charge d'affaires
remains open.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Jordan began to thaw in May 1995,
when Amman apparently distanced itself from Baghdad, and called
for political changes in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, then planning minister Rima Khalaf became the
first Jordanian cabinet minister to visit Kuwait after the
crisis, but the visit turned out to be highly symbolic with few
concrete results.

BANGKOK-- The Thai Transport and Communications Ministry is
asking for the cabinet's approval to let the private sector take
over the operation of 26 provincial airports which are currently
under the control of the Aviation Department, the Bangkok Post
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A government source was quoted as saying that the ministry
said the Aviation Department, as a state agency, was not flexible
enough to improve the operation of its provincial airports
because it had red-tape procedures in withdrawing budgets and
could not attract capable personnel due to its low salaries.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Religious Leader Outlaws Use of Fireworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 4 (Xinhua) -- One of Lebanon's top religious
leaders has issued a religious edict, or Fatwa, outlawing the use
of fireworks as "sacrilegious," the Daily Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Sunday, Sayyed Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the Shiite Muslims community, the
country's largest single sect, said that people had spent a
sleepless night on New Year's Eve because the "merchants of
noise" had lured children into buying fireworks.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of harassment is sacrilegious because there is no
difference between storming someone's house and waking up people
violently and using fireworks on the streets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The leader said the use of fireworks encouraged children to
revel in an atmosphere of "backwardness unbecoming in all
civilized countries."
</P>
<P>
More than any other year since the end of the 1975-1990 civil
war, fireworks and tracer bullets lit up the skies of the capital
and other parts of the country on the New Year Eve.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
drawing up an incentive package for investors willing to pour
their resources into the countryside in a bid to stimulate the
rural economy and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here Monday, Undersecretary Melito Salazar
Jr. of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said a task
force created for this purpose will come up with recommendations
on a common incentive package to standardize the grant of these
benefits to potential rural investors.
</P>
<P>
The official said that at present the grant of incentives
varies depending on which government agency is handling a certain
project.
</P>
<P>
Incentives are usually granted to investors in economic zones,
the Subic Freeport and the Clark Special Economic Zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said the incentives offered at the economic zones
include the duty-free importation of capital equipment.
</P>
<P>
In line with its program to drum up economic activity in the
countryside, the DTI has also revised its Investment Priorities
Plan (IPP) for 1999 to give local governments more influence in
determining the kind of development projects that will be set up
in their communities.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1999 IPP, the approval of proposed projects in a
certain community will depend on the economic benefits they will
generate, their relevance to social needs and their compliance
with environmental laws, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Netherlands' former Wimbledon
champion Richard Krajicek said in Sydney on Monday the top
players should ask for more details concerning the Petr Korda
doping case.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for the players to start asking questions
about what really happened," said the Dutch player, who will play
in the Sydney International tournament starting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very sensitive issue to talk about but I don't
understand it ... if he tested positive maybe he must have done
it but maybe there must be another side to the story," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Either you test positive or you don't and people should know
exactly what went on."
</P>
<P>
Korda, the Australian Open champion from the Czech Republic,
tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone at last year's
Wimbledon championship but has said he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
The International Tennis Federation (ITF) announced the
positive test late last month and that Korda would be stripped of
his ranking points and the 94,529 U.S. dollars he earned in prize
money at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
However, the ITF said it would not ban Korda because it
believed him when he said he had not knowingly taken the drug.

<HEADLINE> Lower Childbirth Death Rate Amongst Shanghai Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to improved health
facilities, over the last two years China's largest city of
Shanghai has cut the death rate of women in childbirth to that of
most developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The number of women dying in childbirth is now only 12.48 per
100,000 people, compared to 13 per 100,000 in developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1996, according to a report in the "Wenhui Daily", 62
out of every 100,000 pregnant women died in China's major coastal
cities before or during childbirth. This was still far below the
actual world average of 430 women per 100,000 and as many as 480
in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the mortality rate in China's poor rural areas is
still 200 per 100,000 women. Health officials blamed hemorrhaging,
hypertension, amniotic embolism, heart attacks, and inaccessible
maternity services as the major causes.
</P>
<P>
A national action program for child development has been
running in China throughout the 1990s and by the year 2000 the
national average death rate in childbirth is expected to have
fallen to about 95 women, half of the 1990 rate.

ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 6,743 hectares of
forests were burnt in 1,924 fires in Turkey in 1998, local Daily

</P>
<P>
According to data from the Turkey's Forestry General
Directorate, carelessness and negligence resulted in 976 fires

</P>
<P>
The paper said that electrical power lines malfunctions,
traffic accidents and lightning are cited as other causes of
the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
The province of Mugla in western Turkey topped the list of
provincial fire occurrence with 240 forest fires while the
southwestern province of Antalya had the severest damage from
fires, losing 1,425 hectares of forest.

<HEADLINE> Rules Simplified on Supply of Livestock, Frozen Commodities to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to increase the
mainland's market share of livestock and frozen foodstuffs sold
to Hong Kong, China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) has simplified pig supply procedures and
canceled the quotas on certain other products.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Ministry's influential
"International Business Daily," it will allow pig farms direct
access to the market, which was originally monopolized by trading
companies.
</P>
<P>
However, MOFTEC insists that those farms applying for an export
license must reach approved targets in their annual production.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the quality of the pigs will be guaranteed and breeding
methods be improved," said Liu Guosheng, an official with MOFTEC's
Department of Foreign Trade Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry also intends to introduce the new export
procedures for other commodities if this trial period proves
successful.
</P>
<P>
It has already canceled the restrictive quotas for live ducks,
geese and pigeons, along with those for frozen ducks.

GUANGZHOU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Last year industrial and

Local officials attributed the rise to the smooth operation of

by 10.1 percent, with consumer retail sales rising by 11.3 percent
and individual savings deposits increasing by 120 billion yuan.
</P>

The Guangdong taxation departments also intensified their
efforts to crack down on various kinds of financial malpractices

<P>
COLOMBO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Sunday confronted the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels in separate clashes in the north of the country, killing
seven rebels, a military spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ink Dewage said government troops observed a rebel
bunker line ahead of defenses in Mankulam and engaged the rebels
with rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, killing three rebels.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, government troops conducted a small group
operation forward of defenses east of Ampakamam and killed three
rebels, Dewage said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, the government troops operating forward of
defenses at Paranthan sniped and killed one rebel, the spokesman
added.

<P>
Imports of unpolished diamonds decreased 27 percent to 2.7

polished diamonds grew 21 percent over 1997 to over one billion
dollars, reflecting the trend of shifting polishing process to
lower-wage countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel's diamond business was also affected by last year's
market crash in southeast Asia, it added.
</P>
<P>
The United States acquired 61 percent of Israel's exports in
1998, up from 50 percent in 1997, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian market made up 19 percent of the polished diamond
exports market in 1998, while Europe remained steady at 17
percent, compared to 16 percent in 1997, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Build More Farm-to-Market Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
this year speed up a program to speed up the construction of
farm-to-market roads to energize the agricultural sector, an
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued here, acting Agriculture Secretary William
Dar said 20 provinces in the country have released about 250
million pesos (6.25 million U.S. dollars) to build more than 250
kilometers of farm-to-market roads.
</P>
<P>
With nearly three-fourths of the country's poor dependent on
agriculture for employment and income, the government has given
utmost priority to modernizing agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's two-pronged objective is to improve
the quality of life of the agricultural workers and create
conditions favorable to them such as through the construction or
improvement of farm-to-market roads.
</P>
<P>
In addition to hastening the construction of farm-to-market
roads, the Estrada administration has also intensified
agricultural support services, Dar said.
</P>
<P>
According to Dar, his department has distributed 23 units of
outdoor storage equipment, 885 moisture meters, 12 in-store
dryers, 17 electric grain dryers, five tobacco flu-curing dryers
and 274 units of multi-purpose drying pavements or solar dryers to
thousands of farmers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Farm equipment like hand tractors, thresher-shelters, threshers
 and stripper-harvesters was also distributed to farmers and
cooperatives, Dar added.

HAIKOU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Ten computer game shops involved
in gambling or violations of intellectual property rights, have
been closed down in Haikou, capital of the Island Province of
Hainan, and authorities have confiscated 146 computers.
</P>
<P>
Under the guise of providing computer training or consultation,
the owners and operators of the shops were actually engaged in
illegal activities such as offering customers the use of smuggled
or pirated software, many of them pornographic and violent films
in compact disks.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Haikou bureau for industry and
commerce, these practices violate intellectual property rights and
are simple disguises for gambling dens, which are detrimental to

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The remains of a human, sacrificed
in an ancient religious ceremony, have been discovered in the
foundations of a house approximately 5,000 years old in Tengzhou
city in east China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that the victim was tied up and that the
incident dates back to the late Dawenkou Culture, which historians
say was prevalent in the region maybe some 6,300 to 4,500 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Local archaeologists say it is an unusual find as similar
discoveries from that period only involved pigs.
</P>
<P>
The ancient ruins are located in a village where both domestic
living quarters and tombs were mixed.
</P>
<P>
According to the archaeologists, they have so far unearthed
about 20 tombs but found only limited amounts of pottery,
indicating that the locals were poor, which were buried with the
dead.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Good or Bad, Child Marriage Common in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- When Rita Luintel was just 14
years old, her parents married her off against her own will.
</P>
<P>
"Though I'm happy now with my two-year-old son and husband who
is very helpful and takes care of me, I have the feeling that
marriage should not be done before 20 as said in the TV and
radio," 18-year-old Luintel told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"It is not good to marry at an early age," she held. "I
attended primary school only but my parents married me at the age
of 14."
</P>
<P>
"I listened to the radio and TV and they say that it is not
good to marry before 20. I wanted to study. But what could I do?"
said Luintel who lives in a village in the Kathmandu Valley,
Nepal's most developed area.
</P>
<P>
She is only one of the thousands bounded in child marriage, an
age-old practice in the Himalayan kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"The history of child marriage in Nepal goes back to the
ancient times," Rishi Keshiv Regmi, professor of sociology at the
Tribhuvan University, said.
</P>
<P>
He said parents think that they have fulfilled their
responsibilities after they marry their children off at a young
age.
</P>
<P>
Lal Bahadur Tamang living in a village in Kathmandu is a father
with a similar mindset.
</P>
<P>
"It is not good to keep daughters for a long time," he said.
"They are supposed to be given to others. Then why should we take
their responsibility?"
</P>
<P>
"There is a fear with the grownup daughter all the time until
she is married," he explained. "It is good to marry at an early
age. I could not send her to school because of my poverty."
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm satisfied because I fulfilled my responsibility," he
added. "I myself, my brothers and sisters also married before the
age of 15."
</P>
<P>
But it seems unlikely that his fear ends there because three
other daughters are still living under his roof.
</P>
<P>
Professor Regmi attributed child marriage to the lack of
knowledge and awareness.
</P>
<P>
"The literacy rate of Nepal is very low and this is very very
low in the remote western part of the country so they don't have
knowledge about at what age they should marry their children," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Superstition, religion and tradition have also played an
important role for this trend," he added.
</P>
<P>
He continued to say child marriage used to be found in every
part of the country until some years ago. It is now popular
particularly in the western part of the country and other remote
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Most of the people in the rural areas want to marry their sons
earlier so that they can help them in their work, he said, adding
that the practice exists as well in urban areas where people live
in poverty.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after the introduction in 1964 of the Civil Code
prohibiting the marriage of girls and boys aged below 16 and 18
respectively, the cases of child marriage have been going down
slowly in the country.
</P>
<P>
He believed that with the spread of education and the effective
implementation of the law, the child marriage system will come to
an end.

<HEADLINE> Significant Growth for South China's Industrial Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 4 ( Xinhua) -- Despite the negative impact
of the Asian financial crisis, industrial production in south
China's Guangdong Province witnessed a high rise last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the added value of Guangdong's industry grew on 1997's
figures by 11.5 percent to 350.8 billion yuan, with industrial
output jumping by 13.5 percent to 1,187.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Rapid development in basic industries largely accounted for the
overall industrial growth. The turnover of posts and
telecommunications rose by 21.74 percent to 36.8 billion yuan in
1998, while the number of passengers carried by the transport
sector hit 596 million, up 20 percent. Power generation reached
103.4 billion kwh, an increase of 5.4 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 also witnessed a substantial rise in exports of
manufactured goods. In particular exports to Europe, North
America, Latin America and Oceania surged by 23.7 percent, 23.8
percent, 33.9 percent and 44.5 percent respectively but exports to
the Asian region were sluggish and only grew by 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
To boost it's industrial growth, Guangdong shut down a number
of loss-making enterprises in such sectors as mining and sugar
production, while within the textile industry production was
slashed with 113,000 spindles destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Easier Access to South China's Pearl River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A highway network is taking
shape in the Pearl River Delta, an economic powerhouse in south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the people of Hong Kong needed 4 hours to go to
Guangzhou, Guangdong's capital, from Shenzhen, the country's first
special economic zone near Hong Kong, but it only takes an hour
and a half now and the Delta area is becoming smaller.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has built a highway network to link
Guangzhou with Shenzhen, Sanshui, Huadu, Shantou, Foshan and
Kaiping since August of 1989. Now the province is crisscrossed by
a total of 785 kilometers of higheays.
</P>
<P>
In the Pearl River Delta, the highways used to be separated by
rivers, which seriously affected the transport of raw materials
and finished products and local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the provincial government introduced
market competition for highway construction and developed various
ways of raising funds. In the past two decades, it allocated two
billion yuan (about 250 million U.S. dollars) annually for highway
construction.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial transportation department officials, by
2000, Guangdong will have 1,800 kilometers of highways and all
prefecture-level cities will be connected.
</P>
<P>
And, by 2010, a network centered on Guangzhou will connect
national trunk lines, major cities, transportation hubs, and
ports, and cargo from anywhere in the province can reach harbors
within 24 hours.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province in east China is
set to improve the water quality of Chaohu Lake, around which are
109 enterprises, each of them producing more than 100 tons of
waste water every day.
</P>
<P>
All the factories in the valleys will have to meet state
emission standards by the end of this year, according to a
provincial government official.
</P>
<P>
Chaohu Lake, one of China's five largest freshwater lakes, has
been seriously polluted in the past several years because of rapid
economic development in the region. Environmental officials say
that the government will help enterprises raise funds and develop
technology to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
Factories that have no hope of meeting state emission standards
will be shut down and have production changed as soon as possible,
the official says.
</P>
<P>
The province has banned new projects that will cause pollution
in the lake valleys.
</P>
<P>
A loan of some 140 million U.S. dollars from the Asian
Development Bank will be used in dealing with the problem.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh City Polls to Be Held in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Elections to 139 municipalities in
Bangladesh will be held on February 23-25 and polls to the
country's four city corporations in late March or early April this
year, the Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission made the decision at a meeting here on
Sunday, but the schedule of the elections for the 139
municipalities would be announced in the middle of this month, an
Election Commission official told Xinhua on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are 182 municipalities in Bangladesh, but the February
elections would not take place in 43 of them for various reasons.
The tenure of elected councils is not over in seven
municipalities, and there are cases over 25 and border disputes in
19 of the municipalities.
</P>
<P>
According to a court order, the municipality elections have to
be held by March 19.
</P>
<P>
The tenure of the 139 municipalities ended in February 1998,
but the elections were deferred one year because of a writ
petition against a certain amendment to the electoral law.
</P>
<P>
Under the amended provision, the government would enjoy the
right to appoint a bureaucrat to run the municipalities for the
period between the expiry of the tenure of an elected body and the
take-over by another elected body.
</P>
<P>
A specific date for the city corporation elections was yet to
be decided. Officials said the Election Commission had a plan to
hold the corporation polls in Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and
Khulna with a brief break after the municipality elections.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 summit (Developing Eight) would be held in Dhaka on
March 1-2, and the secondary school certificate examinations would
start on March 4 and continue to weeks. "So we are planning to
hold the city corporations elections at the end of March or early
April," Secretary of the Election Commission Abdullah Harun Pasha
said.
</P>
<P>
The last municipal polls in Bangladesh were held on January 30,
1993.

<HEADLINE> Encyclopedia of Bangladesh to Be Out by 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Banglapedia, an Encyclopedia of
Bangladesh in ten volumes both in English and Bangla, will come to
light in 2002, leading English newspapers here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bangapedia, a 100-million-taka (about 2.06 million U.S.
dollars) project of the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh (ASB), will
encompass the whole range of knowledge of the Bangladeshi people
and their culture and civilization from the pre-history times to
date, ASB president Professor M. Harunur Rashid was quoted as
saying in Dhaka Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Encyclopedia of Bangladesh has been designed as a national
reference work, research and information tool for scholars,
professionals, students and other general users, he said.
</P>
<P>
Encyclopedias in English are available in plenty, sources from
ASB noted, adding that only one or two have been compiled in
Bangla, and their lives and usefulness were short-lived for one
reason or another.
</P>
<P>
Twelve selected scholars from different disciplines have
already written the outline of the encyclopedia and another 65
scholars have been selected to scrutinize the draft, according to
the sources.
</P>
<P>
The encyclopedia is expected to contain a minimum of 10,000
entries to be contributed by more than 1,000 scholars from both
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
There is also a plan to preserve the Encyclopedia, when
completed, on a CD-Rom, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Prepares to Meet EU Standards in Fish Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has set up a special
unit to inspect and ensure the required quality standards of fish
exports to the European Union (EU), officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new unit functions under the Ministry of Fisheries and
Aquatic Resources Development which has been appointed as the
competent authority for the health control of fishery products,
said a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
This follows representations by the EU that Sri Lanka should
maintain several guidelines to ensure quality of fish products if
it desires to continue to export fish to European countries
without being included in the list of banned countries.
</P>
<P>
The unit will undertake inspection activities with regard to
land sites and vessels, said the spokesman, adding that fisheries
harbors are being restructured in accordance with EU directives.
</P>
<P>
Laboratories servicing the fishing industry will be accredited
in accordance with International Standardization/Standards
Organization (ISO) Guide 25.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen will also be trained to hygienically handle fish on
board fishing vessels, the spokesman said.

and seven cars, including the vehicle of a trooper who had been
working on an earlier accident.
</P>

The accidents left Interstate 81's northbound lanes closed and
backed up traffic at least 10 kilometers. The highway was exp

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Warns Against Loss of Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General
Tin Oo has called on the people to oppose and prevent the
situation which can cause the nation to lose its sovereignty and
plunge into the life of a vassal or a satellite nation of
neo-colonialist powers.
</P>
<P>
Tin Oo, second secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, made the call at an inaugural ceremony of a
newly-built dam in Mandalay division on Sunday without naming the
colonialists.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for the people to keep a wary eye on
"reactionaries," charging them with taking a head-on collusion
course and heading for conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that building of a modern and developed nation
is not for a single person or a single group, but for the
interests of all the national people.
</P>
<P>
He called on the people to work in perfect union to build a new
nation with goodwill to bring about benefit to the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been accusing foreign neo-colonialists of
interfering its internal affairs and attempting to endanger its
sovereignty, calling for opposing and crushing those who rely on
external elements and try to jeopardize the stability of the state
and progress of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Mafia Boss Nabbed in Southern Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 3 (Xinhua) -- An Italian Mafia clan boss accused
of ordering nine murders was arrested Sunday in the country's
southern region of Calabria after being at large for over a year.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Cordi, one of Italy's most wanted fugitives, evaded
capture during a police sweep in October 1997 that put an end to
a long and bloody feud between two Mafia clans based in Calabria.
</P>
<P>
Cordi served as a politician in the crime-ridden town of Locri
in Calabria before taking over his clan's leadership in the wake
of his brother's assassination in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
He is believed to have ordered nine murders between 1994 and
1997, setting off a full-scale gang war that claimed seven lives
in seven months of 1997.

WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Jerry Quarry, a former
American heavyweight boxer, died in Templeton, California on
Sunday after being taken off life support at the request of his
family. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
Quarry was hospitalized on December 28 with pneumonia and then
suffered cardiac arrest while at Twin Cities Community Hospital.
</P>
<P>
He died after family members directed doctors to remove life
support.
</P>
<P>
Quarry finished his career with a 53-9-4 record including
fight with Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson after having fighting
more than 200 bouts as an amateur.
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights of Quarry's career were two fights
against Patterson, the former heavyweight champion. The first
ended in a draw and he won the second on a controversial split
decision.
</P>
<P>
Quarry, 1.83-meter and 88-kilogram, earned his biggest payday,
338,000 dollars, by fighting Ali.
</P>
<P>
The pounding he had taken in his boxing life caused severe
damage to his brain, turning him into a confused, childlike man
by the age of 50.

<HEADLINE> Euro Begins Cautious Trade in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The euro, Europe's new single
currency, started formal trading in Sydney Monday morning quietly
and cautiously.
</P>
<P>
Australia was to have been the site of the first official trade
in the euro but India jumped the gun and traded the new currency
on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
As it was, trading in Sydney was quiet with many foreign
exchange dealers hesitant to take positions in a currency with no
history.
</P>
<P>
The new European currency first traded in Sydney at 1.1744 U.S.
dollars almost level with the expected rate of 1.1668 U.S.
dollars, and 1.91828 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Australian Financial Services Minister Joe Hockey said Monday
Australia's status as a regional financial center was boosted by
the start of trade in the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
Hockey said the eyes of the world's major central banks and
financial institutions were on Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Our time zone advantage over Singapore and Hong Kong was not
lost on world financial markets this morning," Hockey said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Trade in the euro appeared to go smoothly from the open of the
local market at 5 a.m. Monday local time (18:00, Sunday GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia's foreign exchange desk was
more heavily staffed than usual and one dealer said despite the
slow start the euro was very liquid.
</P>
<P>
But, he said a lot of that could be attributed to participants
simply wanting to be trading on the first day.
</P>
<P>
By 6 a.m., the new currency had traded to a high of 1.1750 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The open of the local interbank market at 6 a.m. was quiet but
dealers expected it to pick up as the day proceeds.
</P>
<P>
ANZ Investment Bank head of foreign exchange John Reedyk told
the Australian Associated Press that trade in the euro so far in
the morning had been moderate.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the main participants in the trade in Sydney were
international banks such as ABN Amro and Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the European Union's 15 members have adopted the
euro: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Denmark and Sweden have decided to wait and see before
joining the currency and Greece was refused membership after it
failed to meet the stringent economic targets set by the Union.
</P>
<P>
From midnight on New Year's Eve, the 11 national currencies
ceased to exist as separate currencies and became subdivisions of
the euro.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the hard currency of the euro will not be
released until January 2002 and notes and coins of the national
currencies will remain in circulation until June that year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Differ on Plan to Expedite Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Senators of the United
States on Sunday voiced differing opinions on a plan to expedite
the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Several senators said the president should consider delaying
his State of the Union address, scheduled for January 19, if the
trial is not wrapped up by that time.
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be unseemly and distracting for the
president to be giving a State of the Union address to Congress
while he was under trial in the Senate," Senator Slade Gorton, a
Republican, told NBC's "Meet the Press".
</P>
<P>
Gorton and Senator Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat, were the
first to conceive of the bipartisan plan for a condensed
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which was later floated by the Senate's Majority L
eader Trent Lott, would allow for an early "test vote" to see
whether the required two-thirds of senators would back the
president's ouster if the substance of allegations in the Monica
Lewinsky case were proven true.
</P>
<P>
The vote would be taken after summary arguments from both
sides and no witnesses would need to be called. If the
preliminary vote failed to show support for expelling Clinton,
the Senate could then move on to consider censure.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has been searching for a resolution to the impeach
ment issue after the Republican-dominated House of
Representatives, in a vote cast mostly along party lines,
approved last month two articles of impeachment charging Clinton
with lying under oath and obstructing justice. Both charges stem
from his affair with Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
Democratic senators expressing their views on Sunday's talk
shows were generally supportive of the bipartisan proposal that
Lott has been working on with Senate Democratic Leader Tom
Daschle.
</P>
<P>
But there were different views among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Senator Thad Cochran, a Republican, said he personally would
endorse the Lott compromise, but said it will need to be
discussed among other senators. "If it isn't acceptable then we
may have to make amendments to it or changes to it to accommodate
all senators," he told CBS's "Face the Nation" program.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Phil Gramm said on "Meet the Press" that a
trial was needed because the president, although acknowledging an
improper relationship with Lewinsky, has disputed charges that he
lied under oath and obstructed justice. "We've got to hear from
both sides to do justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Senator Arlen Specter, another Republican, who had said
publicly in the past he did not think removing Clinton was in the
nation's best interests, said senators nevertheless had a duty to
hold a trial and complete it with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The new 106th Congress is set to convene on January 6. One of
the first orders of business in the Senate will be to swear in
the 100 members as jurors in the Clinton trial.
</P>
<P>
House Republicans who will serve as "managers" -- or
essentially prosecutors -- of the Senate trial already have
criticized Lott's idea of an expedited trial followed by a "test"
impeachment vote, saying it would deprive them of the chance to
make their case.
</P>
<P>
But Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, said House Republicans
had shown "condescending arrogance" and accused them of trying to
meddle in the Senate's decision on how to conduct the trial.

<HEADLINE> China Suceeds in Breeding More Giant Pandas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding
Research Base in China's Sichuan Province has used artificial
insemination to produce 45 giant pandas, with 27 surviving more
than 6 months.
</P>
<P>
After more than 10 years of efforts by researchers, according
to Yu Jianqiu, a specialist in the field, the simulated wild
environment of the base has allowed researchers to do a
comprehensive study of breeding and illness prevention of giant
pandas and develop artificial insemination technology.
</P>
<P>
Twelve zoos and one animal reserve in the world have bred about
140 giant pandas with a much lower surviving rate, 29 percent,
though, since China used artificial insemination to breed the
first baby in 1963. The 30-hectare base in the northern suburb of
Chengdu has been developing breeding technology since it used
frozen semen for artificial insemination in 1980.
</P>
<P>
All naturally born giant pandas and 80 percent of those
produced by artificial inseminations have been able to have
babies. Giant pandas only have one or two babies each time. Less
than 10 percent of the base's males and 24 percent of the females
are able to mate by themselves.
</P>
<P>
There are only about 1,000 pandas in existence, in China's
Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces, 80 percent of them in
Sichuan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Cocoa Production Expected to Bounce Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's cocoa production is
expected to recover in 1999 after being hit by a severe dry spell
caused by El Nino, the Jakarta Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's cocoa production is expected to reach 330,000 tons
in 1999, a 6-percent increase compared to the 310,000 tons
produced last year.
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the La Nina weather phenomenon for this year's
cocoa harvest will not be as drastic as El Nino's. If the weather
condition continues to be favorable for cacao trees, I believe
that our cocoa output could reach 330,000 tons in 1999," executive
director of the Indonesian Cocoa Association P.S. Siswoputranto
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the effects of the 1998 El Nino-caused
drought, the drop in the country's cocoa output in 1998 was not as
extreme as predicted.
</P>
<P>
"We expected that production in 1998 would at least reach the
1997's level of 307,000 tons. But we are still gathering data from
the provinces, and we believe that cocoa production might increase
slightly to 310,000 tons for 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the El Nino cycle in 1997/1998, Indonesia experienced
its most severe drought in 50 years. The country could only
produce 307,000 tons of cocoa beans in 1997, far below its initial
forecast of 330,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino weather phenomenon is an abnormal weather system in
the tropical Pacific Ocean which triggers exceptionally warm and
long-lived ocean currents which disrupt global rainfall and wind
patterns and cause droughts or flooding across the globe.
</P>
<P>
La Nina is brought about by unusually cool temperatures in the
Pacific Ocean and often follows the drought-inducing El Nino. Its
arrival brings more rain and violent tropical storms.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is currently the world's third largest cocoa producer
after Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana with an output of 317,000 tons of
cocoa beans in 1996, or about 10 percent of the world's supply.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Calls for Building Great National Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior-General
Than Shwe Monday called on its national brethren of the union to
build a great national force full of physical and intellectual
powers so as to carry on with the task of building a new peaceful,
modern and developed nation.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion of the country's Independence
Day which falls on Monday, Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), said Myanmar has
always fought and vanquished all attempts perpetrated by
treasonous internal elements and self-seeking malevolent external
threats to break up the union.
</P>
<P>
"Movements crowned with victories throughout history also stand
testimony to the fact that we had possessed awesome might and
power of resolving and overcoming all emergent difficulties and
building anew," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present when moving on towards the end of 20th century,
Myanmar has already laid down three main national causes --
non-disintegration of the union, non-disintegration of national
solidarity and perpetuation of sovereignty, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the on-going National Convention is
formulating an enduring state constitution that will guarantee the
country's three main national causes.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to strive with might in carrying on with
the historic responsibility.
</P>
<P>
On international relations, he stated that Myanmar, not only as
a member of the United Nations but also a member of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, is participating in Asian
and global affairs on equal terms, firmly holding the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
A flag-hoisting and saluting state ceremony was also held at
the People's Square here Monday morning to mark Myanmar's
Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SPDC also conferred religious titles, medals for
excellent performance in different fields, medals for making good
public services and good people's police force services to
winners.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar regained its independence on January 4, 1948 from the
British colonialist rule.

JAKARTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 miners at the Mt.
Pongkor gold mine in Bogor, West Java province of Indonesia, were
believed to be killed when the shafts in which they were working
caved in last Saturday, Antara News Agency reported Monday.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector in Hunan Province Helps Jobless Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- In 1998, the private sector in
Hunan Province, central China, has become a major means of easing
the unemployment pressure of people laid off from state and
collectively-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the laidoff workers have found jobs in
private enterprises, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
By November, private enterprises in the province had taken over
some 2,000 state and collectively-owned enterprises through
mergers or leasing agreements, helping 300,000 people get jobs.
And, the skills and discipline of the former employees of state and
collectively-owned enterprises are welcome in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
And the provincial government has also issued licenses for
200,000 laidoff workers.
</P>
<P>
Because of the improved management and distribution systems in
the private sector, these workers have a more positive attitude
toward their work and earn more.
</P>
<P>
Many have set up their own businesses. Cao Zhibin, who was let
go by a sock factory, established the Yiyang Yinbin Sock
Factory by raising 140,000 yuan (about 17,500 U.S. dollars) and
gave jobs to 30 laidoff workers. In 1998, the factory
earned one million yuan and paid taxes of 20,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> 26 Provincial Airports in Thailand to be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A government source was quoted as saying that the ministry said
the Aviation Department, as a state agency, was not flexible
enough to improve the operation of its provincial airports because
it had red-tape procedures in withdrawing budgets and could not
attract capable personnel due to its low salaries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the ministry considered transferring those airports to
the Airports Authority of Thailand. However, the state enterprise
had financial and personnel constraints.
</P>
<P>
After handing over the provincial airport operation to the
private sector, the Transport and Communications Ministry planned
to transform the Aviation Department into a regulator governing
the safety standard of air transportation and promoting aviation
businesses, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The plan has already received the consent of the National
Economic and Social Development Board, the Finance Ministry and

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko has vowed to take whatever it takes to keep the
country's currency stable this year.
</P>
<P>
In talking to the Ukrainian Interfax news agency Saturday,
Pustovoitenko said the stabilization of Hrivnia is mandated by
the 1999 budget law passed on December 31.
</P>
<P>
While adopting the legislation, the Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, recently has also set forth principles for monetary
and credit policies, said the head of government.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, he said, these measures would allow people to know
clearly about the fluctuation of the exchange rate of Hrivnia
against U.S. dollar throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
The rate was 1.8-2.25 Hrivnias to one dollar January through
July in 1998, and then 2.5-3.5 Hrivnias to one dollar in
September in the wake of Russia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
For now, the country's central bank has managed to keep the
exchange rate at around 3.427 Hrivnias to the dollar for more
than two months.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed as Floods Blanket 6 Provinces in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Floods hit at least six
provinces in Indonesia over the weekend, causing seven deaths in

</P>
<P>
The rain, which has fallen since New Year's Eve on Thursday,

<HEADLINE> Dongguan City Enjoys Double-Digit Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The city of Dongguan in south
China's Guangdong Province exported products valued at over 11.19
billion US dollars during the first 11 months of 1998, up 22.21
percent on the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The export growth rate was 22 percentage points higher than the
national rate in spite of the negative impact of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Dongguan, which accounts for 6.8 percent of China's total
exports, is situated between Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong
Province, and Shenzhen, the forerunner in the nation's reform and
opening drive.
</P>
<P>
The city, one of China's largest export processing and
manufacturing bases, is home to 13,000 companies engaged in related
production. Dongguan's processing sector exported products valued
at over 10.67 billion US dollars during the 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shunguang, director of the Dongguan Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Commission, attributed the city's
double-digit export growth to the 1995 implementation of a
strategy to upgrade the processing industry.
</P>
<P>
Dongguan has shifted from developing labor-intensive industries
to expanding the fund- and technology-intensive sectors which
feature high valued-added value and in-depth processing services,
as well as from assembling imported components to manufacturing
products according to buyer specifications.
</P>
<P>
Dongguan also approved 1,246 overseas-funded projects during
the first 11 months, with total investments rising 10.94 percent
to slightly over 1.23 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city has expanded its the traditional exports market in
Southeast Asia to the United States, the European Union, and
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Bassett Dismisses Claims of Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Nottingham Forest football club
manager Dave Bassett squashed suggestions that he is about to
quit the Premiership's bottom club, according to local reports on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rumors of his resignation aroused after Nottingham Forest was
beaten by First Division club Portsmouth 1-0 in the third round
of the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Bassett delegated assistant Mickey Adams to attend a
post-match press conference after deciding to go home because he
was suffering from flu.
</P>
<P>
But he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek program on Sunday:
"I haven't resigned. Radio Nottingham put it out, which is a
scandalous decision. People speculate, but that's the day and age
we live in."
</P>
<P>
He said: "Basically as I was feeling a bit rough I said to
Mickey Adams - as a manager you can delegate - 'Go and talk to
the press.'
</P>
<P>
"People started to add things up and decided I'd resigned, but
that's not the case."
</P>
<P>
Bassett insisted he did not feel let down by his players, but
acknowledged that confidence was low at present.
</P>
<P>
"We were within three minutes a fortnight ago against
Blackburn. Had we won that, they would have felt a lot different.
But that knocked the stuffing out of them and there's no easy way
to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We've taken another blow where we've gone out of the FA Cup,
which is disappointing because players only get a few chances to
get to Wembley in their career and each year you get knocked out
of the FA Cup you miss the chance."
</P>
<P>
Dave Bassett's managerial career began at Wimbledon, where he a
chieved promotion in three successive years, taking the Dons from
the Fourth Division to the First.
</P>
<P>
After he left Wimbledon, Bassett took charge at Watford for a
season, and then worked his promotion miracles with Sheffield
United, taking them from the Third division to the First.
</P>
<P>
He took over at Crystal Palace after leaving United, before
quitting mid-way through the 1996-97 season to become general
manager of Forest, working alongside caretaker boss Stuart Pearce.
</P>
<P>
Forest's relegation to the first division saw Pearce stand
down and leave the club, and Bassett took sole control.
</P>
<P>
He enhanced his popularity at the City Ground by leading them
back to the Premiership at the first attempt.

<HEADLINE> Charlton Backs World Cup Status Quo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Sir Bobby Charlton has given a
cool reception to news that FIFA's executive committee is
considering a plan to stage the World Cup every two years.
</P>
<P>
The finals currently take place every four years but Sepp
Blatter, president of football's world governing body, said the
policy is now "out of date".
</P>
<P>
He believes staging the game's biggest tournament more often
will combat the growing influence of leading European clubs.
</P>
<P>
Blatter told the Swiss newspaper SonntagsBlick: "I am
demanding a clear statement: 'Do we want national teams or do we
only want club football?'."
</P>
<P>
His proposal would see the finals taking place in
even-numbered years, with national sides taking part in
qualifying during the intervening 12 months.
</P>
<P>
"The existing four-yearly tournament is out of date. It dates
from the 1930s when the teams chugged from one continent to
another on ships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blatter confirmed that his call was a direct response to plans
for a European Super League, which he fears would result in clubs
being unwilling to release players for international duty.
</P>
<P>
The next World Cup will be co-hosted by Japan and South Korea
in 2002 and any changes could not come into force before 2006.
</P>
<P>
But Sir Bobby, a member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning
side, said "My own personal feeling is that every four years is
often enough. You have to wait for it and it increase the whole
value of it."
</P>
<P>
He added: "When it comes from Sepp Blatter you take it
seriously because he won't have said it lightly. But my own
feeling is that it wouldn't have the same attraction and that
would be very sad."
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Football Association also has reservations, but
is willing to judge the proposal on its merits.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Andy Mitchell said there were "obvious practical
difficulties" with the European Championships currently taking
place between World Cups.
</P>
<P>
"I think there would have to be a lot of hard bargaining
between UEFA and FIFA for the proposal to become reality," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Given the pressures there are on international football at
the moment, it might not be possible."
