<HEADLINE> Tanzania Witnesses Record Revenue Increase in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government's
revenue hit a record high to reach 77.2 billion shillings (about
96.5 million U.S. dollars) in May due to a boost in the collection
of income tax, customs duty and value added tax.
</P>
<P>
This represented an increase of 23.2 billion shillings (about
29 million dollars) compared to the revenue collected in the
previous month, the Bank of Tanzania said in its latest monthly
economic review.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, government expenditure in May
amounted to 76.5 billion shillings (about 95.6 million dollars), a
figure which is 12.9 billion shillings (about 16.1 million dollars)
higher than that for April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the annual headline inflation rate remained stable
at a minimal 6 percent throughout April and May, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Measured on a month-to-month basis, the overall inflation went
down by 0.8 percentage point in May.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank cautioned that the declining trend in
the overall inflation may be subdued by food shortages in several
regions of the country, though the trend is expected to continue
in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the bank's governor Daudi Ballali expressed
his optimism about Tanzania's economy and outlined several
conditions to be fulfilled within the next 18 months before the
country qualifies fully for debt relief conditions given by the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, the main condition is to maintain
macro-economic stability, particularly having sustainable economic
growth and low inflation levels.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's economic record in the last five years is clearly
impressive. The economy has been growing at about 4.8 percent,
well above the 2.8 percent population growth, while the annual
inflation was kept at 6.6 percent as of May.
</P>
<P>
There are clear signs that economic growth in the eastern
African country will continue to maintain the upward trend,
following interest being shown by foreign investors in various
sectors of the economy, including industry, mining, agriculture
and tourism, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Lanka's Deputy Speaker to be Envoy to Austria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Deputy Speaker of
Parliament Anil Moonesinghe is tipped to be the country's new
ambassador to Austria, Foreign Ministry sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Moonesinghe, who is a nationalist Member of Parliament of the
ruling People's Alliance, is expected to resign shortly to take up
the new appointment, said the sources, adding that he will succeed
C. S. Poolokasingham who returned to the island a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear who fill the vacancy created by
Moonesinghe in the Lankan parliament which stands to be dissolved
on August 24 after concluding a six-year term.
</P>
<P>
However, it is widely believed that Vartharajah Perumal, former
chief minister of Sri Lanka's North Eastern Province, will be
brought in to Parliament. Perumal, who once lived in exile in
India for several years, has returned to Sri Lanka and become an
ardent supporter of President Kumaratunga.

<HEADLINE> Workers' Welfare Committee in EPZs Endorsed by Bangladeshi PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Prime Minister's office has
finally endorsed the Workers' Welfare Committee as outlined by
Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA), Commerce
Minister Abdul Jalil said at an inter-ministerial meeting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commerce minister said the Prime Minister's office endorsed
the framework of the committee with some changes and decided that
the labor groups in Export Processing Zones (EPZs) would select
their representatives in the welfare committee.
</P>
<P>
A committee headed by the Board of Investment (BOI) Executive
Chairman on July 4 formulated the framework of Workers' Welfare
Committee and neutral Labor Relations Tribunal to ensure workers'
rights in the EPZs.
</P>
<P>
The BEPZA first outlined the formula to avoid direct trade
unionism in the EPZs as all the investors excepting those from the
United States opposed the U.S. move for allowing trade union
activities in the EPZs.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government primarily opposed the U.S. idea but
finally considered some sort of labor union type under tremendous
pressure which included a threat of canceling Generalized System
of Preference facilities on Bangladesh exports to the U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has long been pressing Bangladesh
government to allow trade union activities in the exclusive
economic zones under the pressure of the American Federation of
Labor and Congress for Industrial Organization.
</P>
<P>
A Bangladeshi delegation, led by Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil,
is likely to go to Washington next month to explain Bangladesh's
position and its alternative measures for ensuring EPZ workers'
rights.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Sees Bright Future for African Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Liu Hao, Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
LOME, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Organization
of the African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said here on
Wednesday that an African Union will play an more important role
than the OAU in the development of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Salim told a press conference that the 37-year history of the
OAU showed that Africans need an organ with greater powers to deal
with political, economic, and social challenges facing Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has not other choices but the union to meet the
challenges in the economic globalization," he said, stressing that
"Africa will have a more united union than the European Union."
</P>
<P>
He said that the founding of the African Union is of the same
significance with the founding of the OAU in early 1960s when the
African states got rid of the western colonial rule one after
another.
</P>
<P>
After three-day deliberations, leaders attending the 36th OAU
summit signed the Draft Constitutive Act of the African Union here
on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Under the Act, the African Union will be officially established
until the OAU member states ratify the document which covers the
establishment of a series of organs including the Assembly, the
Executive Council and the Pan-African Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The African Union will also establish a series of financial
institutions including the African Central Bank, the African
Monetary Fund and the African Investment Bank.
</P>
<P>
Salim rejected doubts about the future of the African Union,
saying history has proved that the OAU is very successful though
many doubted it at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that from the OAU to the African Union, Africans
will enhance their cooperation in all sectors in a more effective
way.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the ratification will be well done before an
extra-ordinary summit of the OAU in March next year in Sirte,
Libya where the African Union was initiated by the African leaders
on September 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"However, we don't force the member states to make ratification
if their people don't accept it," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Salim, "OAU will be dissolved one year following
the founding of the African Union."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that more than 80 percent of the heads of state
and government at the present summit signed the Act while others
including South Africa, Uganda and Nigeria promised to follow in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
Salim pointed out that those countries which boycotted the OAU
summit did not mean they boycotted the OAU but the venue, Lome.
</P>
<P>
Angola and its alliances including the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) boycotted the Lome Summit, accusing Togo of
supporting Angolan rebels by providing weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, Salim reaffirmed the OAU's decision to exclude the
Comoros and Cote d'Ivoire from the summit, claiming that
unconstitutional change of government is no longer tolerated.
</P>
<P>
"African people prefer to choosing their leaders by votes
rather than by bullets," he said.
</P>
<P>
On regional conflicts, Salim said the OAU and its member states
will try every means in cooperation with the international
community to explore ways to end the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief appealed again for the release of the United
Nations peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone, the national
reconciliation in Somalia, a quick cease-fire and withdrawal of
foreign troops from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Salim said that during the three-day summit sessions, African
leaders discussed the African economies and the challenges of
globalization, the role of the regional economic communities in
the process of African integration, African debts and approaches
for solution, and the challenges of peace, security and stability
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed solutions to the conflicts between Ethiopia
and Eritrea as well as in the DRC, Sierra Leone and Somalia, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Founded on May 25, 1963, the OAU is designated to promote the
unity and solidarity of the African states, defend the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of members, coordinate and
intensify the cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life for
the people of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Following eradicating all forms of colonialism from Africa, the
organization has been focused on peace and development and
reversion of the growing marginalization of Africa in economic
globalization.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Start Peacekeeping Operation in Ethio-Eritrean Border Region: Major General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations, together
with the Organization of African Unity (OAU), will deploy
peacekeeping forces along the Ethiopia-Eritrean border as soon as
possible in a bid to keep the momentum of peaceful settlement of
the border dispute between the two countries, a senior U.N.-
designated military officer said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I have an impression that both Ethiopia and Eritrea have the
will for peace, the two countries want to have the peacekeeping
forces deployed at their border region as soon as possible," said
Major General Timothy Ford of the U.N. Reconnaissance Mission.
</P>
<P>
He said that pending the deployment of peacekeeping forces,
the United Nations will deploy liaison officers in the capitals of
both countries within a few days.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that there will be five to six U.N. liaison
officers and about three OAU officials, Ford said, noting that "
this will be the first U.N. presence in this area."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the structure of the peacekeeping troops, the
general said that there will be military observers supported by
peacekeeping troops including aviation unit, demining unit,
engineering unit and logistic unit.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question where the U.N. peacekeeping troops
will be deployed, Ford said that the troops will be deployed in a
temporary security zone that is yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
Under the cessation of hostility agreement signed by Ethiopia
and Eritrea in Algiers on June 18, the Ethiopian troops will not
withdraw from their position which is about 25 kilometers inside
Eritrea until the deployment of U.N. peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
According to Ford, the number of countries contributing
peacekeeping troops has not been decided either, but he confirmed
that the neighboring countries of Ethiopia and Eritrea will not be
involved.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the U.N. peacekeeping forces will be
deployed as quickly as possible. It is important to complete the
deployment before the end of rainy season, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the demining along the Ethio-Eritrean border, the
major general said that all mines in the region must be cleared so
as to pave way for the deployment of the peacekeeping troops and
to avoid deaths and injuries of people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in addition to international effort, it is
also the responsibility of the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea
to carry on with the demining activity.
</P>
<P>
Ford and his entourage arrived here Tuesday after a four-day
visit to Eritrea where they visited key sites along the frontlines
and held discussions with Eritrean officials on the implementation
of the cease-fire agreement as well as on the U.N. peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ford had similar discussions with Ethiopian
military authorities over the establishment of a temporary
security zone along the Ethio-Eritrean border region, a military
coordination commission, the main tasks and composition of a U.N.
peacekeeping operation and demining.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. reconnaissance team headed by Ford has also conferred
with the diplomatic community based in Addis Ababa on the
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
Ford is due to make a field visit to the northern front of
Ethiopia, before departing for New York next Tuesday to prepare
and submit his findings and recommendations to U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan concerning the deployment of a U.N.
peacekeeping force.

fight against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration on HIV/AIDS in Africa issued at the end of a

responsibility and provide leadership for the fight against the
scourge of AIDS.

make it a development issue.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to develop and enact national strategies to
deal with HIV/AIDS as a priority within national development plans.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Parliament Condemns Arrest of Turkish Cypriot Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus House of Representatives
President Spyros Kyprianou on Thursday protested against the arrest
of Turkish Cypriot journalists by the breakaway Turkish Cypriot
regime of the island.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou made the protest in a letter to European Parliament
President Nicole Fontaine, President of the Parliamentary Assembly
of the Council of Europe Lord Russell Johnston and Secretary
General of the International Federation of Journalists Aidan White.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia. In 1983 the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a
breakaway state in northern Cyprus which is only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to Greek Cypriot media, the chief editor and three
journalists of the Turkish Cypriot newspaper Avrupa and two other
persons in the Turkish Cypriot area were arrested last week on
charges of spying against the Turkish Cypriot regime and Turkish
troops, which controls northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said in the letter that the Cyprus parliament "
condemns this abhorrent act" aimed at muzzling voices which could
be heard in favor of rapprochement between Greek and Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou urged the international community, all
parliamentarians and journalists in particular, to intervene in an
effective manner for the immediate release of the arrested.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sarah de Jung, an official of the International
Federation of Journalists, will arrive here Friday to investigate
the
case.
</P>
<P>
Reports said de Jung will visit Sener Levent and the other
journalists detained, as well as the Avrupa's offices.
</P>
<P>
She will also seek a meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash and Turkish Cypriot party leaders to demand immediate
release of the journalists and an end to the persecution of the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Putin Vows to Improve Economic Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia is trying to create
conditions favoring expansion of industry and the entire economy
rather than winning short-term popular support, President Vladimir
Putin said in an interview to be published in the Friday edition
of the Izvestia newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The state has been honoring all its social commitments, making
use of the favorable situation on the world markets, but will not
expand its social programs without proper consideration, the
Interfax news agency quoted Putin as saying in the interview.
</P>
<P>
"The state has been working to meet the targets of budget macro-
indexes. Now, for the first time in the years of reform, budget
revenue exceeds expenditures," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the state has acted more vigorously "in the
spheres related to business such as taxation and law enforcement
in the economy."
</P>
<P>
"You can see that we act cautiously but are moving forward,"
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the measures have met with strong resistance,
but the state does not "resort to unconstitutional steps."
</P>
<P>
"Whenever it is in the scope of the executive branch we pass a
presidential decree or a Cabinet ordinance, but some issues cannot
be resolved in the framework of existing law, and then we go to
the Duma," the lower house of parliament, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who offer resistance will do their utmost to discredit
our steps," Putin said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno promised Thursday to review the e-mail monitoring system used
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) so that privacy can
be safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
"When we develop new technology, when we apply the Constitution,
I want to make sure that we apply it in a consistent and balanced
way," Reno said at her weekly news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking a look at it now," she said, "if additional
regulations are needed, we will pursue those."
</P>
<P>
She said that she is looking into FBI's new high-tech "
Carnivore" system to ensure that privacy safeguards and the needs
of federal law enforcement officials are met.
</P>
<P>
The "Carnivore" system can scan all incoming and outgoing e-
mails for messages associated with the target of a criminal probe.
</P>
<P>
"It can be a wonderful tool and I don't want it to be a tool
that is, in any way, a cause of concern for privacy interests,"
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. civil rights group have complained that the system
breaches the Internet provider's rights and the rights of all its
customers by reading e-mails and their addresses.

<HEADLINE> Greece Dismisses Denktash's Criticism Over Geneva Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 ATHENS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday dismissed the
charges made by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash over Greece's
"interference" in the Geneva proximity talks, saying that Denktash
must realize that he was not the judge but the one who was being
judged.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas urged Denktash to comply with the framework of the
U.N. resolutions and contribute to a solution to the Cyprus issue,
which he was not doing but, on the contrary, he was undermining.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To reunite the divided island, The Greek Cypriot side-led by
President Glafcos Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot side-led by
Denktash have held two rounds of the U.N.-sponsored indirect talks
in Geneva and New York, and the third round of such talks ended in
Geneva Wednesday with no sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
Greek ministers said earlier this week that Denktash's
positions was unacceptable as it envisaged the continuing division
of the island, and Denktash complained that Athens was trying to "
kill the talks through unacceptable interference."
</P>
<P>
Greece, who signed a joint defense pact with Nicosia, and
Clerides has insisted that the island must be reunited in a
federation formula in line with the U.N. resolutions while the
Turkey and Denktash demand that a confederation formed by two
sovereign states be set up on the eastern Mediterranean island.

<P>
Blair made the commitment while detailing the government's
third annual report to members of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The publication of the report, seen as a key part of Labor's
fight-back after a rocky few weeks, coincided with a warning by
Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain, who said the government was
out of touch with the voters.
</P>
<P>
Blair told MPs that the government's key goals remained health,
education and transport, while he was keen to point that
unemployment was down, inflation was down and wages were up.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would tackle any remaining problems in
the school system with: "Investment, investment, investment
guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
Turning to transport, he said substantial extra investment was
needed. "We admit it. The 10-year transport plan to be published
shortly will show how it can be done," he said.
</P>
<P>
On crime, the prime minister promised more police officers.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the health service, he said waiting lists for in-
patients were down and the next stage would be to create a"
sustained fall in outpatient waiting".
</P>
<P>
In the report, which is based on the commitments laid out in
Labor's 1997 manifesto, Blair wrote: "We are on the way to meeting
our five election pledges and 10-point contract with the people."

<HEADLINE> China Questions Election Fairness in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday voiced its
concerns over whether a free and fair election can be held in
Kosovo, as the relevant U.N. resolution is not fully implemented
in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xu, member of the Chinese Mission to the United Nations,
told an open Security Council meeting that the security situation
on the ground remains very grave because of the terrorist actions
by Albanian extremists and the ineffective protections given by
the international peacekeeping force (KFOR).
</P>
<P>
"Our worries are whether elections can be held in a free, fair
and peaceful environment," he said, adding that the insecure
situation on the ground demonstrated that the Security Council
resolution 1244 is not fully implemented in Kosovo and the U.N.
Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR should
work much harder to reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
Serb refugees have a lot of difficulties in returning home in
Kosovo, and those who have returned home are very few, he said,
this is simply because the Albanian extremists are taking
terrorist actions to prevent Serb refugees from returning while
crimes against those who have returned, such as abductions and
murders, frequently took place in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Authorities Must Be Strong, Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, Putin said, the authorities must be open at the same
time, because "if the authorities remain in place thanks only to
restrictions and prohibitions... the value of such authorities is
zero."
</P>
<P>
"The authorities cannot be truly effective or strong unless
they are open, predictable and use their tools to protect the
dignity of the people, their liberties and right to choose," the
Interfax news agency quoted the Putin as saying in the interview.
</P>
<P>
"It is a deeply entrenched Russian habit to curse the
authorities, to fear them and not expect anything good to come
from them," Putin said. He attributed it to what he described as
the country's horrible history and the "continuous changing of the
rules of the road, the instability of property rules (and)
inconsistent legislation."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "while the state was loosening the reins on
the economy, tax dodging and other abuses have assumed a massive
scale, so numerous businessmen risk strained relations with the
law. They have every reason to be nervous," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"It would hardly be fair to shift the blame onto individuals
and make believe that the state is not responsible for the
situation. This is the reason why we have taken steps designed to
improve the entrepreneurial climate in the country," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Bills concerning taxes and deductions to extra-budgetary funds
have already been sent to the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Once these measures are approved, a new stage of conscientious
mutual responsibility and mutual commitments between the
authorities and the business community will settle in, he said.

concluding his visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Upon departure, Medelci said he has reached agreement with Iraqi
officials on enhancing relations, especially trade ties, between

</P>
<P>
Medelci affirmed his country's willingness to conclude new
contracts with Iraq under the current United Nations oil-for-food

<HEADLINE> UAE Says No Intention to Unilaterally Raise Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates'
Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Obeid bin Saif Al
Nassiri said on Thursday that his country has no intention of
increasing its oil output unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
He added that any decision on such an increase will come within
the framework of the decision of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which the UAE is a member.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a closed-door meeting with visiting
Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister and OPEC president Ali
Rodriguez Araque, who was on a lightning visit to the UAE,
according to the official WAM news agency.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued at the end of the meeting, the
ministers emphasized their countries' determination to maintain
stability of the oil market and to cooperate with other OPEC
members and non-OPEC oil producing countries in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Both agreed that fluctuations on world oil market are not in the
interest of either the producers or the consumers in the long run.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ali Rodriguez said the two sides had
exchanged ideas on the current oil market and had agreed on all
points of their discussions. He dismissed the necessity of an OPEC
emergency meeting to assess the oil market situation.
</P>
<P>
He added that he also discussed with his UAE counterpart a
number of other issues including the OPEC summit scheduled in the
Venezuelan capital of Caracas in September and the upcoming visit
of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to the UAE on August 9.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was on a tour of the region which had already taken
him to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, during which he discussed with
officials of the two countries the situation in oil market, which

</P>
<P>
Lebanon is the first Arab country to pass such a legislation and

are similarly equipped such legislation.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Nasser Saidi said the law is "a revolution." He

<HEADLINE> New Jordanian Cabinet Wins Overwhelming Support From Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new government headed by
Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb on Thursday won a vote of confidence
in the lower house of the National Assembly (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The new government won 74 favorable votes in the 80-seat House
of Representatives as against only six blackballs, believed to be
the most overwhelming victory in the kingdom's history.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb had headed the Economic and Financial Committee of the
House before he was appointed prime minister in mid-June by King
Abdullah Bin Hussein, who has the constitutional rights of sacking,
appointing governments or dissolving the parliament.
</P>
<P>
A new prime minister is subject to a vote of confidence in the
House four weeks after the appointment by the monarch.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's vote came after three days of debate in the House
during which 75 deputies took the podium to call on the government
to improve services, fight corruption, nepotism, bloated
bureaucracy, poverty and soaring unemployment.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, many deputies asked the government to
help realize the right to return of the Palestinian refugees living
in the kingdom and their adequate compensation; and many others
called on the government to bolster relations with Arab countries,
notably with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his reply to deputies during the debate, Ragheb reiterated
that the government wants a role in any Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations on the refugee issue to ensure the right to return or
compensation of the 1.5 million Palestinians refugees seeking
shelter in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees here have been granted Jordanian
citizenship, but the government supports their rights to choose
between returning to their homeland or staying in the kingdom while
asking for compensation from parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Iraq, Ragheb affirmed that Jordan sought an
end to the United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq, the main
supplier of oil of Jordan, since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also pledged to implement sweeping reforms,
including broader freedom for the press and political parties and
drafting a modern election law.
</P>
<P>
On economy, he said the situation was not easy and the
government was faced with a big challenge, but he projected a 3-
percent economic growth for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a royal decree to appoint Ragheb prime minister, King
Abdullah asked the government to make it a top priority to develop
national economy and improve the living standards of the people.
</P>
<P>
One third of the Jordanians are living below the poverty line --
with a monthly income of less than 80 dinars (112 U.S. dollars) --
and the unemployment rate stands at over 14 percent by official
statistics while independent estimates put it at 27 percent.

<HEADLINE> Detention of Egyptian-American Professor in Egypt Prolonged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian higher state security
prosecution on Thursday renewed detention for another 15 days of
Saad Eddin Ibrahim, an Egyptian-American sociology professor at the

American University in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Maher Abdel Wahed approved the decision taken
by the security prosecution in the presence of Ibrahim who was
charged with undermining Egypt's social stability, the country's
official Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, also director of the Ibn Khaldoun Center for
Development Studies, was accused of taking money from foreign
sources to draft
reports on the internal situation in Egypt and produce a film
tarnishing the country's reputation. He was also charged with
fomenting internal problems that could threaten Egypt's stability.
</P>
<P>
Nadia Mohamed Abul Nour, an accountant of the center, will also
be detained for 15 more days pending investigations, the news
agency said. Ibrahim and Nour were arrested on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecution ordered on Wednesday the detention of
four other people for 15 days, bringing the total number held in
the case to 13.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said the four -- one from the Ibn Khaldoun
Center and the three others from the Women Voters' Support Center,
affiliated to Ibrahim's center -- received bribes from Ibrahim to
forge voting cards.
</P>
<P>
Stacks of voting cards have been seized from Ibrahim's center,
and investigators have accused him of paying people for forging the
cards and registering names of fictitious voters on them.

<HEADLINE> Scientists at AIDS Conference on Significance of "Durban Declaration" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A panel of scientists from
Africa, Asia, Europe, North and Latin America unanimously agreed
on Thursday that the controversial so-called "Durban Declaration"
had paved the way for future scientific debate on HIV within
orthodox parameters.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hoosen Coovadia, chairman of the 13th International AIDS
Conference, said the document had been a watershed in the debate
that raged recently in South Africa regarding the link between HIV
and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of this document cannot be underestimated. To
me it stands in belief of scientific principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Durban Declaration, which a total of 5,000 scientists across
the world signed before the conference, categorically refuted the
assertion by dissidents that the HIV might not cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Coovadia, also a member of South African President Thabo Mbeki
's AIDS panel, said the Durban Declaration was never meant to be
an attack on the president.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he believed the dissidents in the panel never
took the HIV debate any further in any constructive way.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Chewe Luo from Zambia said the future of the declaration
should not hinge on the Mbeki angle, adding that HIV was killing
people and to ask whether HIV caused AIDS was futile.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Botswana and Zambia, which had high infection
levels because of inaction, could be an warning for other
countries where infection levels were not yet so rampant, Luo said.
</P>
<P>
American scientist Dr. Charles Van Der Horst, who was involved
in the initial coordination of the draft of the Durban Declaration
a month ago, said he sent electronic messages to eminent
scientists around the world, petitioning the cause.
</P>
<P>
He received an overwhelming response, including from 12 Nobel
Prize Laureates.
</P>
<P>
"The scientific evidence that HIV causes AIDS is unambiguous.
The unprecedented document has been backed by scientists who have
dedicated their lives to fighting AIDS," Van Der Horst said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Export More Power to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Kenya are negotiating
to increase the former's power sale to the latter from the current
30 megawatts to 80 megawatts, a Ugandan official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda now exports to Kenya up to 30 megawatts power a day and
stops exporting during the peak hours between 6:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.
m. when the demand in Uganda is high," Godfrey Turyahikayo, energy
commissioner of Uganda's Energy and Mineral Development Ministry,
told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's power export to Kenya has increased after the Unit 11
of the Owen Falls Extension Project with a capacity of 40
megawatts was launched in May this year.
</P>
<P>
"When the Unit 12 at the expanded power generating dam in the
Ugandan city of Jinjia is launched early next month, Uganda will
be able to export to Kenya up to 30 megawatts during peak hours
and totally 80 megawatts a day," he added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has an installed capacity of 240 megawatts. With the
Unit 11 and 12 of the Owen Extension Project being brought on line,
Uganda will be able to export more power to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Uganda exports three megawatts of power to Rwanda and five
megawatts to Tanzania. Kenya is the leading importer of its power,
contributing 750,000 U.S. dollars to the Ugandan treasury every
month.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sets up Panel on Angola Diamond Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
formally selected experts from Britain, Chile, Senegal, Sweden and
Zimbabwe to continue a probe into how the Angolan rebel armed
group -- the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (
UNITA) -- sold diamonds to finance warfare in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
The selection was announced Thursday by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan in his letter to the president of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The panel, headed by Christine Gordon of Britain who is a
consultant and writer on Angola's diamond industry, will work for
a period of six months to investigate into the UNITA violation of
the relevant U.N. resolutions, which imposed sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
Serving on the new panel are Juan Larrain of Chile, a former
history professor and his country's deputy representative to the
United Nations, James Manzou of Zimbabwe, Ismail Sekh of Senegal,
an African regional coordinator for INTERPOL, the international
criminal police organization, and Lena Sundh from Sweden, a
director in her country's foreign ministry and a former ambassador
to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has asked Annan to establish a "
monitoring mechanism" of up to five experts to collect additional
information and report by October 18.
</P>
<P>
A month later, the Council is expected to decide whether to
take action against violators, some named in the March report.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council in 1993 imposed an arms and fuel embargo
on UNITA in an effort to end a 25-year-long civil war in the
former Portuguese colony that has killed some 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In March, a ground-breaking U.N. report by an independent
panel revealed how UNITA imported arms from Bulgaria, using South
African weapons brokers, Belgian diamond merchants, and African
leaders, bribed with diamonds, to circumvent the bans.
</P>
<P>
The "name and shame" report, commissioned by the Canadian
permanent representative to the United Nations, Robert Fowler, had
recommended arms embargoes and diplomatic isolation against
nations intentionally breaking its sanctions. But several Council
members were opposed.
</P>
<P>
The report accused the presidents of Burkina Faso and Togo,
and the later Zairian dictator Mobuto Sese Seko of receiving
diamonds for helping UNITA with arms and fuel shipments. Rwanda
was also accused of facilitating guns-for-gems deals.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak Hold Bilateral Meeting at Camp David </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday held face-
to-face talks at Camp David, the first of its kind since the three-
way summit started at the presidential retreat in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"A meeting was held between the two leaders, but I cannot
elaborate on the content," an Israeli official told reporters on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton had shuttled back and forth between the
Israelis and Palestinians during the past two days of talks.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton left Camp David Thursday morning for commitments in
Baltimore and Washington, Barak and Arafat were expected to pursue
their rounds of face-to-face talks to settle differences on final
status issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides remain at loggerheads over all the core issues:
the future of Jerusalem, the borders of a Palestinian state, the
fate of Palestinian refugees, and future of Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
During Clinton's absence, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
has reportedly take charge of the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investigates Police Beating of Black Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
Thursday started an investigation into the beating of a black
suspect by police officers in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said at her weekly news conference
that U.S. Attorney has commenced an investigation.
</P>
<P>
A dozen police officers were seen beating Thomas Jones after a
chase Wednesday. The scene was captured by videotape from a news
helicopter and broadcast around the nation.
</P>
<P>
Police and witnesses said officers chased Jones in a stolen car
until it crashed, then exchanged gunfire with him.
</P>
<P>
Jones was able to commandeer a police car and fled before he
was cornered and subdued, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
This event has reminded people of the 1991 Rodney King case
that ignited rioting in Los Angeles after four white officers were
acquitted of state charges. Two officers were eventually convicted
of federal civil rights charges.
</P>
<P>
Jones was in fair condition Thursday at Temple University
Hospital with injuries to his abdomen and arms.
</P>
<P>
An officer who was shot was in good condition at Hahnemann
University Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Underlines Lessons on Srebrenica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Five years after the fall
of Srebrenica in Bosnia, the U.N. Security Council Thursday
underlined the importance of the lessons on Srebrenica, a U.N.-
designated safe area where the fall led to the killing of
thousands of innocent civilians, and reiterated its commitment to
the full implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council, Patricia Durrant of
Jamaica, invited the members of the 15-nation Council to observe a
minute of silence in honor of the victims of the Srebrenica murder
when the Council met in an open session on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
In a commemorative statement on Srebrenica, Durrant described
the tragic events as "one of the worst civilian massacres in
Europe since the end of World War II."
</P>
<P>
"The tragic events at Srebrenica must not be forgotten," the
statement said. "The Council regrets the deplorable events and
recalls its resolve to ensure that justice is carried out fully
through the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia, and that the crimes are not repeated in the
future."
</P>
<P>
"The Council stresses the importance that lessons be learned
and acknowledges the (U.N.) Secretary-General's report on
Srebrenica," the statement said. "The Council reiterates its
commitment to the full implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords
and to the establishment of multi-ethnic democracy and the rule of
law throughout the territory of the former Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has expressed his "deepest
regret and remorse" on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the
Srebrenica massacre.
</P>
<P>
"The tragedy of Srebrenica will forever haunt the history of
the United Nations," Annan said in speech here Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 Muslims are believed to have been executed by
Serb forces after the fall of the U.N.-proclaimed safe zone in
July 1995.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 bodies have been found so far in the vicinity of
Srebrenica, but only 70 have been identified.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot undo this tragedy, but it is vitally important that
the right lessons be learnt, and applied in the future," Annan
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The principal lesson of Srebrenica is that we must oppose evil
not with compromise but with "implacable resistance," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
In a report last November, Annan admitted U.N. errors, but
maintained that the collective international community was
responsible for the massacres.
</P>
<P>
Srebrenica has become the symbol of the suffering caused by
the Bosnian war, which cost 200,000 lives between April 1992 and
November 1995.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Hold More Talks With Taliban on Women's Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Coordinator for
Afghanistan, Erick de Mul, is planning to travel to Kabul on
Sunday to continue his discussions with the Taliban authorities on
the recent issue concerning the employment of women in
international organizations, U.N. said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Erick Mul traveled to Kandahar Wednesday and had talks with
the Taliban, the biggest warring party in Afghanistan, on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
U.N. said Erick had positive talks with the Taliban and the
issue concerning the employment of women by the U.N.in Afghanistan
was in the process of being resolved.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban issued the edict last week which banned Afghan
women from international nongovernmental organizations and U.N.
agencies in the country. Should it be put into effect, it would
have a detrimental effect on the United Nations 's capacity to
deliver aid to Afghans.
</P>
<P>
While women are restricted from working in the Taliban-
controlled areas of Afghanistan, in the past, exceptions have been
made for women working in the health sector and other essential
roles within national and international organizations. Without
their continued participation, a number of humanitarian assistance
program for Afghanistan would be severely constrained.
</P>
<P>
U.N. said that a major concern has been the possible effect on
the World Food Program's bakery projects. The World Food Program
is currently feeding 1.5 million Afghans in the country.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Bisons to Be Returned to The Wild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is footing a
project in Romania for returning to the wild of the bisons from
the reservations, the local daily Romania libera reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the project nursed by Romania's Forests Authority and the
Institute for Forest Research and Administration, six bisons
living in the northeastern Vanatori Neamt Forest Park will be
released into a nearby forest enclosure in a first stage of this
project.
</P>
<P>
The welcoming enclosures will become increasingly large, up to
200 hectares, in order to help bisons feed by themselves.
</P>
<P>
A specialist from a country where bisons managed to stay alive
in the wilderness, will come over to set the conditions for this
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Neamt reservation managers hope this first stage where bisons
living in captivity would try to adapt to the wilderness will
become successful during the next five years and be expanded into
other areas of Romania's Carpathian Mountains and thus join the
area across the northern border of the country.
</P>
<P>
The bison was an extinct species in southern Carpathian
Mountains since the 17th century and in eastern Carpathians since
the 19th century.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Highlights Significance of Peace Agreement For Palestinian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Special
Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Terje Roed-Larsen,
on Thursday released a report on the Palestinian economy which
details many of the major challenges that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the report, the Special Coordinator said "Real long
term growth of the Palestinian economy requires sustained private
investment and increased exports.
</P>
<P>
Only a viable peace agreement would provide the stability and
predictability necessary to achieve these goals, he said.
</P>
<P>
 The talks at Camp David represented a unique window of
opportunity to achieve a lasting peace, and to ensure a durable
prosperity for the Palestinians, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
 In his report, the Special Coordinator also highlighted the
importance of a more rapid pace of institutional and fiscal reform
by the Palestinian Authority
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. report, referring to developments in 1999, finds the
following:
</P>
<P>
 -- Real GDP and GNP growth of 6 percent and 7 percent
respectively;
</P>
<P>
 -- A 15 percent increase in employment in Israel;
</P>
<P>
 -- A 7 percent increase in domestic private sector employment;
</P>
<P>
 -- A 14 percent increase in planning construction activity;
</P>
<P>
 -- Significant growth in new company registrations;
</P>
<P>
 -- A 32 percent increase in outstanding bank credit to
business;
</P>
<P>
 -- A 12 percent increase in donor assistance;
</P>
<P>
 -- A 3 percent increase in the average daily wage.
</P>
<P>
 Despite these improvements, the report noted that Palestinian
exports and non-construction private investment, the two
fundamental components of sustained growth and development, remain
depressed, lagging behind general economic gains.
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, while per capita income grew 2 to 3 percent in
1999, it remained 10 percent below its 1993 level.
</P>
<P>
 The report also noted the slower growth in 2000.

making "false and misleading" statements to a federal court during
President Clinton's impeachment trial.

Prosecutor John Griffith declared that in fact, Bakaly "had

If Bakaly is convicted, he could get a sentence of six months

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Comprehensive Measures on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
said that large-scale social rehabilitation, an effective
political process, resources and sacrifices in addition to force
are needed to resolve the problem of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody must understand that the choice is between resolving
this issue now or flinching it, withdrawing and facing the same
problems later with casualties much higher than now," Putin said
in an interview that will appear in the Friday edition of the
Izvestia newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops launched a military campaign against
rebels in the breakaway republic last September in the wake of
armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a series of
apartment explosions that left over 300 Russian dead in Moscow and
two other cities.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale military actions have ended in Chechnya, but the
remaining rebels, estimated at around 2,000, are mounting sporadic
attacks on federal troops and police units.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of federal soldiers and policemen were killed last week
in a series of rebel suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
"Patience, delicate and balanced action are needed in tackling
problems such as those that we are facing in the North Caucasus. A
high price will have to be paid for every mistake."
</P>
<P>
If cut loose by Russia, Chechnya would not be free. Instead, it
would be taken over by extremists and immediately become a
springboard for attacks on Russia, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Russian media reported earlier Thursday that federal aircraft
flew 56 bombing and reconnaissance missions in Chechnya over the
previous 24 hours, targeting rebel strongholds there.
</P>
<P>
As tensions persist in and around Chechnya, security measures
have been stepped up elsewhere across Russia.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, all vital systems and facilities have been put under
increased control, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting
sources with the municipal government of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has instructed the district authorities to
strengthen the security of educational establishments, medical
centers, transport and communication systems, bridges and
industrial enterprises, Interfax said.

WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Democratic Senator
Bill Bradley Thursday joined Vice President Al Gore's presidential
campaign at a campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
Bradley, Gore's rival for presidential nominee during the
primary season, appeared for the first time together with Gore at
the rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, since the former senator
dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
"I am especially pleased to be here with Al Gore," Bradley told
a cheering audience.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities and difficulties of our new age require new
thoughts, new ideas, and new actions. The vice president will
provide that kind of innovation. The nation, as a whole, will
benefit from his leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who warmly embraced the long-anticipated get-together
with Bradley, spoke highly of the former senator in his positions
on campaign finance reform, racial discrimination, health care
reform and others.
</P>
<P>
"I treasure Bill Bradley's support. He is a good Democrat, who
speaks and stands for principles we all believe in," Gore said. "
Bill Bradley will be an important part of this campaign and an
important part of America's future."
</P>
<P>
Gore and Bradley met privately in an airport lounge before
heading to the rally. Aides said the two men shook hands and
loosely embraced.
</P>
<P>
Bradley is expected to address the Democratic National
Convention scheduled to be held in Los Angeles from August 14 to
17.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Resumes Regular Flights to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A passenger plane of Egypt's national
carrier flew to Libya on Thursday, resuming regular flights between
the two countries after a hiatus of eight years due to
international sanctions imposed on Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The EgyptAir plane carried 71 passengers and 62 civil aviation
officials, who will discuss some remaining technical issues with
their Libyan counterparts, the state-run Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir board chairman, Mohammed Fahim Rayyan, said the
Egyptian company will have three flights each week from Cairo to
Libya -- two to the capital Tripoli and one to the Mediterranean
city of Benghazi.
</P>
<P>
The number of flights may be increased if needed, Rayyan said.
</P>
<P>
Libya's first plane in eight years touched down at Cairo
International Airport last Saturday, carrying 11 passengers and a
delegation of Libyan civil aviation officials. The Libyan Arab
Airlines (LAA), the national carrier, will make 12 return flights a
week between the two countries including seven linking Tripoli and
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
LAA's two flights will link the Mediterranean cities of Benghazi
in Libya and Alexandria in Egypt in addition to two weekly flights
between Benghazi and Cairo and one between Sabha, 600 kilometers
south of Tripoli, and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of air link between Egypt and Libya came more
than a year after the United Nations Security Council suspended an
eight-year air embargo on Tripoli following the handover of two
Libyans suspected of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Officials on both sides have attributed the delay to technical
and commercial reasons.

known as the Uluburun Wreck, will be put on display as of July 23
at the Underwater Archaeology Museum at Turkey's western Aegean Sea
port of Bodrum, Anatolia News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The wreck of a Syrian vessel sunk into the waters of the
Mediterranean in about 1306 B.C. while transporting the goods it
loaded from Egypt to the Greek Mediterranean island of Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
It is presented to the public 18 years after its discovery off
the shores of Uluburun, after which the wreck was named, near
Turkey's southern Mediterranean port of Kas.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said the Uluburun Wreck "is a matchless, living
Late Bronze Age example" that has survived all the way through the
ages, with its rich load and other important equipment.
</P>
<P>
The museum, which was termed as one of the "nine most important
museums of Europe," hails the Uluburun Wreck as its "pillar of
underwater archaeology."
</P>
<P>
Director of the museum Oguz Alpozen, one of the first divers to
reach the wreck, said the wreck will be displayed in the same way
as when it was discovered so that visitors can see how it looked
under the water with its load and everything aboard.
</P>
<P>
"Enthusiasts and museum officials from the United States,
Britain, France, and Greece will attend the inauguration to be made
by Culture Minister Istemihan Talay," said Alpozen.
</P>
<P>
The 20-meter long vessel was discovered by a diver in 1982 at
some 60 meters below the sea surface and was recovered in 25,000
dives carried out between 1984 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The vessel is a fine example of the Late Bronze Age maritime
creation, lighting up archaeologists about that age with the items
it had been carrying.
</P>
<P>
A golden seal of Queen Nefertiti, royal consort of Pharaoh
Akhenaten (reigning 1379-1362 B.C.) of Egypt famous for her
colorful limestone bust now in Berlin Museum and her support for
the pharaoh's religious reforms, is considered the most important
item of the load.
</P>
<P>
Another seal, carrying the name of a later pharaoh, supports
estimation that the ship might have sunk in 1306 B.C.
</P>
<P>
A small note pad, with two boxwood leaves attached to each other
with an ivory hinge, is considered the oldest book of the world.
</P>
<P>
The golden seal of Nefertiti and many other important items
found in the wreck will be displayed at a separate hall in the
museum.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the "astonishing" load also include 10 tons of
Cyprus copper, 1 ton of pure tin, over 150 round and flat bullions
of different sizes, shapes, and colors, one ebony tree, one cedar
tree, over 100 amphoras, 1 ton of resin collected from different
types of Middle Eastern and Aegean trees.
</P>
<P>
It was also loaded with many other delicate craftworks such as
processed ivory pieces, sea shells, turtle shells used to make
musical instruments, ceramic and metal mouthpieces, ostrich shells
used to make vases and cups, ceramics, wine cups, gold and silver
bracelets and necklaces.

<HEADLINE> African Scientists Call for Coordinated Anti-AIDS Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- African scientists on
Thursday called for coordinated efforts to find an affordable
vaccine for the HIV/AIDS virus by 2007.
</P>
<P>
They were unanimous at the launch of the African Strategy for a
HIV vaccine at the ongoing 13th International AIDS Conference in
east South Africa's Durban city, finding that a vaccine was the
only way to win the war against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The strategy which was drawn up in Nairobi, Kenya, on June 14
aims to bring together scientists on the continent to coordinate
their efforts to find an affordable vaccine.
</P>
<P>
They spoke out against what they termed the "scientific
exploitation and manipulation" of Africa by international agencies.
This would also assist in curbing the uncontrolled spread of the
disease in Africa, where 24 million people were already infected.
</P>
<P>
Professor Malekgapuru Makgoba, president of the African Medical
Research Council, said there was the need for a coordinated
African effort to find a vaccine, and to achieve this, the
scientists on the continent had to work together and exchange
information.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize we have a serious epidemic in Africa. In the
midst of this epidemic we have African scientists all doing their
own thing to find a vaccine. The fact that we are not working
together allows us to be exploited by international agencies,"
Makgoba said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of trials for an African vaccine started in
Uganda last year. Kenya, in partnership with the United Kingdom,
will start trials for another possible vaccine in December, while
South Africa and the United States trials will begin next January.
</P>
<P>
While pledging the commitment of the African scientists to
work together to find the vaccine, Makgoba stressed the need to
work with urgency to the solution to the epidemic threatening to
wipe the nation on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"We are racing against time," he said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, these scientists want at least one vaccine in
its final stages of testing by 2007.
</P>
<P>
Two main strains of the virus were found in Africa, and
African scientists will focus on developing a "broad" vaccine
which could effectively deal with the disease, according to
Makgoba.

<HEADLINE> Two accused of Hacking Into NASA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The teenager hacker surrendered to police Tuesday for allegedly
hacking into three NASA computers in Virginia and New York, local
media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Long Island student allegedly broke into the NASA computers
in November. The youth, charged with computer tampering, was
released into his father's custody. He allegedly defaced the NASA
Web site by replacing certain files on the site with various
images.
</P>
<P>
The teen said he hacked into the sensitive systems for fun.
</P>
<P>
Raymond Torricelli, a 20-year-old New Yorker, was arrested
Wednesday at his home and charged with using his personal computer
to break into two computers belonging to NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The lab is the lead center for
exploration of space with robotic spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found 76,000 passwords on Torricelli's computer,
including usernames from computers owned by San Jose State
University and Georgia Southern University.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said in court papers that Torricelli installed a
program on a computer used by NASA to perform satellite design and
mission analysis concerning future space missions. He then
allegedly used the program in chat-room discussions with other
hackers.
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the most serious charge, Torricelli faces up to
10 years in prison and a 250,000-U.S.-dollar fine.

<HEADLINE> Two U.S. Telecom Giants Scrap Merger Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. telecom giants WorldCom
and Sprint announced Thursday they were scrapping their merger
plans, citing opposition from U.S. and European antitrust
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the companies said that "the set of conditions
ultimately demanded by the U.S. Department of Justice would
compromise the customer and financial benefits of the merger."
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Attorney General Janet Reno announced the
Justice Department was suing to block the 129-billion-U.S.-dollar
deal. The Justice Department contended that the merger of the
second- and third-largest U.S. long-distance carriers would leave
millions of Americans paying more for less service.
</P>
<P>
The merger was also opposed by European regulators, who judged
it would corner too much of the Internet. WorldCom offered to sell
Sprint's high-capacity Internet network to alleviate the
regulators' concerns, but the move was considered insufficient.
The two companies had already pulled their merger application in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Both the Westwood, Kansas-based Sprint and the Clinton,
Mississippi-based WorldCom said the Department of Justice had
informed them it would not be able to go to trial before January
2001. Even if the companies were successful in that trial,
approval by the Federal Communications Commission and the European
Commission would still be needed.
</P>
<P>
"Given the competitive nature of the marketplace, prolonged
delay and uncertainty would not be in the best interest of our
shareholders, employees or customers," Sprint Chairman and Chief
Executive William Esrey said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
WorldCom announced plans to acquire Sprint last October,
triggering an investigation by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S. long-distance market, WorldCom's share amounts to
19 percent and Sprint's eight percent. And in the market for
Internet backbone services, WorldCom controls 37 percent and
Sprint 16 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects More Stringent NMD Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a 52-48 vote, the Senate killed a measure requiring testing
of the project against decoys and other countermeasures designed
to foil the system.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, offered as an amendment to a 310-billion-U.S.-
dollar defense authorization bill, also called for an independent
panel to evaluate testing for the system, which has suffered
several highly publicized failures.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department has set a timetable for having the
NMD ready for initial deployment by the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has faced strong pressure in Congress to
take steps to construct the system, designed to shield the United
States from attacks by so-called rogue states such as the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Two of three Pentagon tests have failed to prove the system
would work, most recently on July 8 when an attempt to intercept
and destroy a dummy warhead in space failed because the weapon did
not separate from the second stage of its liftoff rocket.
</P>
<P>
The defense authorization bill would provide 1.9 billion
dollars for the NMD, more than double the amount spent last year.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. NMD, opposed by the
international community, will not only spark a new arms race, but
also threaten security and stimulate nuclear proliferation,
instead of promoting security and stemming the spread of nuclear
weapons.

<HEADLINE> China Finds Prehistoric Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China has discovered a prehistoric
town which has an inner and an outside wall in the city of
Lianyungang in eastern Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the town belonged to the Longshan Culture, a
late Neolithic civilization 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weichao, an expert at the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage (SACH), said the town is one of the best-preserved large
prehistoric sites and will be valuable for research.
</P>
<P>
The town lies in an area south of Zhucao Village in the
Lianyungang Development Zone, covering an area of 150,000 square
meters.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Longshan culture site discovered in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The town's walls stretch for 1,400 meters and its layout can be
clearly seen, archaeologists said. They have found ancient
riverbeds and stone piers, a number of rectangular and round
houses, and ditches outside the town wall.
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the town are paddy fields, well-made roads that are
three to four meters wide, and a high mound of earth used for
religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
Inside the town, the experts uncovered a number of stoneware
and pottery pieces, such as stone adzes, axes, arrowheads, and a
three-legged pottery caldron, basins, pots, plates, cups, as well
as spinning wheels and remains of animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuehai, a well-known Chinese archeologist, said the town
is an important and highly representative Longshan culture site,
which can give clues to the history of other states and cities.
</P>
<P>
The Longshan Culture gets its name from the city of Longshan
near Jinan, capital of Shandong Province. Longshan culture sites
usually contain black, shining pottery.

<HEADLINE> Potential Development of Dunhuang Studies in 21st Century (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Past research focused on single subjects, she said, while the
future research will emphasize Dunhuang art as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"We will find the relationship between each aspect of Dunhuang
art so as to reveal origins of society, science and culture in the
country's medieval times," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, comprehensive academic works and books on Sutra Cave
relics will be published, and further research will be done on
some special subjects such as religion, music, Buddhist art,
ethnic languages and folk customs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts are confident they will continue to play a
leading role in Dunhuang studies in the 21st Century, the 64-year
old archaeologist said.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has the world's richest treasury of documents
and data on Dunhuang Studies. Over 10,000 historical documents
discovered in the Sutra Cave are housed in China, and the country
also has film of 40,000 other documents scattered overseas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the well-preserved Mogao Grottoes provide Chinese
experts a chance to carry out detailed studies on the unique

<P>
Duan Wenjie, a famous Chinese expert on Dunhuang studies,
stressed the importance of collaboration in the research on the
100-year-old branch of learning in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Duan, also honorary president of the Institute of Dunhuang
Studies, said materials and references that are still locked away
in archives will be no good to the development of Dunhuang studies.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to more Dunhuang cultural relics abroad will be
returned to China," said Duan, adding that Chinese experts will
have a better understanding of the relics.
</P>
<P>

cooperation and collaboration in Dunhuang studies, Duan said.

<P>
DUNHUANG, (Gansu Province), July 13 (Xinhua) -- Experts on
Dunhuang studies agree that the research on the 100-year-old
branch of learning will be even more successful in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Fan Jinshi, president of the Institute of Dunhuang Studies,
said that the discovery of the Sutra Cave at the Mogao Grottoes
was a major cultural discovery. The documents in the cave cover
almost all fields of ancient Chinese history, culture and society.
</P>
<P>
The Sutra Cave, also known as Cave 17, was discovered in 1900
by Wang Yuanlu, a monk who lived at this famous archeological site
in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The cave contained 50,000 Buddhist scriptures, documents,
embroidery, and paintings on paper and silk.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 20th Century, Chinese experts launched
the world's first research into Dunhuang studies. Headed by Luo
Zhenyu and Wang Guowei, they published a series of research works
on the field in 1910.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China, Dunhuang studies have
flourished, with plenty of outstanding research developments in
diverse areas such as geography, religion economy, art, literature,
mathematics, astronomy and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dunhuang studies have attracted flocks of experts
from dozens of countries and regions worldwide, including the
United States, Japan and France who also contributed considerable
findings to the studies of document research and grotto art.
</P>
<P>
"If we concluded the past century was a success in the Dunhuang
studies, experts of Dunhuang studies now face the challenge to
achieve even greater progress in the new century," Fan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- An Egyptian survey indicated that 45,000 Egyptian
scientists emigrated to foreign countries in the recent five years.
Among them are 600 scientists of rare specialities, including 94
specialists in nuclear engineering, 26 in nuclear energy, 28 in
chemistry, 25 in astronomy and space science, 28 in biology, 72 in
laser uses and 93 in electronics and software, according to the
survey by the Egyptian Scientific Research Academy.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The World Bank has recently finalized a feasibility
study pertaining to the financing of five development programs in
Morocco to the value of 212 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These programs provide for setting up projects aimed at
reinforcing the infrastructure of villages, overhauling the
educational system, developing the agricultural field, combatting
poverty and updating the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Internet cafe which was set up by industrialists in
Kayseri province, central Turkey, has contributed to the
development of trade with many countries.
</P>
<P>
Kayseri Chamber of Commerce Director Erdal Cinar said that
industrialists in Kayseri had become used to e-commerce at the
Internet cafe which was opened at the Organized Industry Region
seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
The industrialists have started trading with European countries,
Israel and other countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Qatar planned to step up total oil output to about 1
million barrels per day (bpd) by 2001, according to a senior Qatari
official with the General Qatari Oil Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's current daily oil production is 854,000 barrels while
its quota under the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) is around 659,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government put off a program designed to raise
oil production in light of the slump in crude price then. The
decision by OPEC in March 1999 to slash output pushed up the crude
price almost three-fold.

<HEADLINE> Armed Conflicts Erupt Between Different Clans in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Ten people were killed and 15
others were injured in an armed confrontation broke out Thursday
in Galkaio, 800 kilometers north of the Somali capital of
Mogadishu, according to local radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts between the two hostile clans of Habar Gidir
and Majerten in the central town of Galkaio, derived from a
fighting Wednesday afternoon when Majerten fighters sought
extortion money from the animal market dominated by the other clan.
</P>
<P>
The town has fallen into the control of Majerten, led by
Colonel Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed, who was also president of the
regional government of Puntland.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the reason Ahmed chose to take control of
the town is to get more political support when his deputies, clan
elders and intellectuals of the clan have gone to the Djibouti
conference negotiating for the establishment of a new Somali
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another two separate armed confrontations also
erupted in southern Mogadishu Thursday, killing at least 13 people
and wounding 20.

<HEADLINE> HK Customs Vows to Suppress Illicit Fuel, Cigarettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Customs and
Excise Department has devised a multi-pronged approach to address
the illicit fuel and cigarettes problem, a customs official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Acting Assistant Commissioner of Customs and Excise Simon
Wong Shiu-ming revealed the Department's strategy and enforcement
actions against illicit fuel and cigarettes activities at a press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
It has also endeavored to eradicate and suppress illicit fuel
and cigarettes at all levels, i.e. import, export, distribution,
retail and use, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the Anti-Illicit Cigarette Task Force with
a complement of 84 officers was set up. It incorporated the then
40-man-strong Anti-Cigarette Smuggling Task Force.
</P>
<P>
Up to 30 June, 57 large-scale operations (including joint
operations with the Hong Kong Police and Environmental Protection
Department) against the sale and storage of illicit fuel have been
mounted, resulting in the arrest of 248 persons and a total
seizure of 587,991 liters of illicit fuel.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the suppression of illicit cigarettes, various region-
wide operations aiming at enforcement action against street
peddling of illicit cigarettes were launched resulting in the
seizure of 10.4 million sticks of cigarettes with a value of 13.7
million HK dollars (1.7 million U.S. dollars) over the past three
months.
</P>
<P>
During these three months, a total arrest of 75 buyers were
made which represents a 74 percent increase comparing to the
arrest of 43 buyers in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the department seized a total of 239 million sticks of
illicit cigarettes with a value of 301 million HK dollars
representing an increase of 120 percent comparing with the seizure
of 104 million sticks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A total of 8.57 million liters of illicit fuel have been seized
in 1999 with a value of 39.57 million HK dollars which marks a 64
percent increase when compared to the seizure of 5.23 million
liters in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition Showcases Aesthetics of Japanese Arts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition featuring 100
pieces of fine artifacts from the Tokyo National Museum opened at
the Hong Kong Museum of Art Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The month-long exhibition, titled "Japanese Art of the 19th
Century - Treasures from the Tokyo National Museum," reflects not
only the cultural trends in the Edo and Meiji periods in 19th
century Japan, but also the aesthetic taste of Japanese living
around that time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Director of Leisure and Cultural
Services Paul Leung Sai-wah said the exhibition was mounted as an
exchange program between the Hong Kong Museum of Art and the Tokyo
National Museum of Japan.
</P>
<P>
He also said Museum of Art was honored to be the first Chinese
museum to establish an exhibition exchange program with the Tokyo
National Museum.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Museum's treasures of Chinese antiquities
were sent to the Tokyo National Museum to mark the opening of its
refurbished Hyokeikan. The exhibition was well received in Japan.
In exchange, the Tokyo National Museum organizes the present
exhibition on Japanese art.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus lies on the 19th century when Japan progressed
steadily towards modernization. It would be meaningful to observe
from the present display how Japan opened up to the West and still
managed to maintain its own national characteristics in art," said
Leung.
</P>
<P>
Since the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907), Japan was deeply influenced
by Chinese culture and gradually developed its own distinctive art
forms and styles. From 19th century onwards, Japanese arts became
known by the West and their frequent cultural contacts paved way
for a new look in the modern Japanese art world.
</P>
<P>
Featuring a rich mixture of works in seven categories, namely
painting, calligraphy, ceramics, lacquer ware, metalwork and
textile, the exhibition reflects the artistic merits representing
various schools and styles flourished in 19th century Japan.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is jointly presented by the Leisure and Cultural
Services Department and the Agency for Cultural Affairs, Japan,
and organized by the Hong Kong Museum of Art and the Tokyo
National Museum and sponsored by Japan Airlines Company Limited.

<HEADLINE> Revised Product Quality Law to Check Fake, Shoddy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators have passed an
amendment to the law on product quality, aiming to upgrade the
level of China-made products.
</P>
<P>
Li Chuanqing, director of the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision, said that the revised law further defines
the responsibility for the government to improve product quality
and stresses that enterprises must accept supervision from the
quality control departments.
</P>
<P>
The amended law includes 74 articles; the original version had
51.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised law, which goes into effect on Sept. 1,
anyone selling fake or inferior products will be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
China launched a series of clampdowns on fake and shoddy
products in recent years. However, the production of poor-quality
products is still a serious problem, especially in small
enterprises, said Li.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the product quality law is urgent, as China
will join the World Trade Organization soon and face competition
from overseas enterprises, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Coalition Government Partially Reshuffled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Mesut Yilmaz, leader of Turkey's
junior ruling partner Motherland Party (ANAP), was appointed on
Thursday as state minister and deputy prime minister for the
European Union affairs while Cumhur Ersumer was dismissed from his
post as deputy prime minister but retained the post of state
minister for energy.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet was partially reshuffled at the request of Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit. It was accepted by Turkish President Ahmet
Necdet Sezer and was issued in the Official Gazette on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz's appointment was within expectations but it was not
clear why Ersumer was dismissed from the post of deputy prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ecevit held 40-minute talks with Yilmaz, who was
recently cleared of corruption allegations in the parliament, and
announced that Yilmaz will take up the position in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Thursday's confirmation of Yilmaz's appointment by the
president, Ecevit said Yilmaz will be responsible for public
institutions and organizations within the framework of the
preparation process to the European Union (EU) membership.
</P>
<P>
But he said foreign relations related with the EU will still be
carried out by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
As an EU candidate, Turkey is stepping up its accession process
to the European club.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz was born in Istanbul in 1947. He graduated from Ankara
University's Political Science Faculty in 1971 and later studied at
Germany's Koln University for two years.
</P>
<P>
As a founding member of ANAP, he acted as deputy chairman of the
party and was elected as a parliamentarian in 1983. Eight years
later, he was elected as the leader of ANAP at the party's general
congress and acted as prime minister for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Last year when Democratic Left Party (DSP) leader Ecevit formed
the current coalition, together with Deputy Prime Minister Devlet
Bahceli's Nationalist Action Party (MHP) and Yilmaz's ANAP, the
ANAP leader rejected a role in the cabinet as he was facing eight
corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who acted as prime minister three times, was accused of
abusing power for self-interests during his tenures.
</P>
<P>
Last month, tension was brewing in Ankara once again as three
MHP deputies joined the opposition deputies in a parliamentary
investigation commission in a bid to file Yilmaz to the Supreme
Court over allegations of graft.
</P>
<P>
The move soured relations between ANAP and MHP, the two junior
partners within the coalition, and jeopardized the coalition's
stability which Ecevit has strived for and is imperative for his
economic reforms program.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that the MHP and ANAP are trying to damage each
other as part of their election strategy as both parties are aiming
to woo nationalist and conservative votes in the absence of the
pro-islamic opposition Virtue Party (FP).
</P>
<P>
The possibilities of an early election still exist because the
Turkish constitutional Court will decide whether the FP is the
successor to the defunct Islamic Welfare Party or not in October.
</P>
<P>
If the court makes a "yes" verdict, the FP will be closed and 70
deputies of 103 FP deputies in Parliament will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Turkish Constitution, if five percent (about
28) of the 550-seat Parliament's deputies are absent, the country
should be forced into an early parliamentary election within three
months.
</P>
<P>
After the decision to file Yilmaz to the Supreme Court failed in
the parliament, the coalition left behind the tension, if
tentatively.
</P>
<P>
Also, the decision in the parliament meant to have cleared
Yilmaz of the corruption allegations, paving the way for his entry
into the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
After offering the position in the cabinet for Yilmaz, Ecevit
said , "Mesut Yilmaz is an experienced statesman with time in the
government. This is a great advantage, ensuring coordination among
public and private institutions."

550 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The consortium will work with the online service provider

textile and apparel trade," Chan added.
</P>
<P>
The eight leading Hong Kong clothing manufacturers in the

<HEADLINE> Estrada to Be Granted Special But Limited Powers for Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A measure seeking to give
Philippine President Joseph Estrada special but limited powers to
speed up the rehabilitation of war-torn Mindanao will be filed
Monday before the House of Representatives, a press official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential palace briefing, Press Undersecretary Mike
Toledo said the bill will be filed by House Majority Leader
Eduardo Gullas when Congress opens it special session on July 17.
</P>
<P>
According to Toledo, Estrada is seeking for special but limited
powers so that his pro-poor administration can expedite projects
geared to transform Mindanao into an economic powerhouse following
the fall of Camp Abubakar, the main stronghold of the separatist
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), into the hands of the
government.
</P>
<P>
"It is intended to set in place or in motion policies to ensure
that Mindanao becomes a competitive and investor-friendly region,"
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
"The special but limited powers will have a life span of about
two years, and we will ensure that there will be no abuse in the
exercise of such powers," he added.
</P>
<P>
Toledo said a special oversight committee composed of five
members of the Senate and the House each will be created to
monitor the exercise of these powers and activities of the
Mindanao Coordination Council (MCC), which held its first meeting
here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The presidential palace, he noted, is "quite confident" that
the measure will pass the scrutiny of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada is committed to bringing genuine and lasting
peace and economic development to Mindanao and reverse the decades-
old official neglect of the southern island.
</P>
<P>
Estrada wants to transform Mindanao into a major financial
center and the country's next food basket, Toledo added.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- One of the world's largest

a week-long goodwill visit to South Africa in September.
</P>
<P>
South African Navy spokeswoman Lisa Hendricks said the 74,000

<P>
SEOUL, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will close its Seoul
office Friday, two years and three months after helping South
Korea overcome its financial crisis which was caused by corporate
bankruptcies and bad loans in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
As South Korea does not need additional loans and agreements
with the bank have all been carried out, the Seoul office will
close as of Friday, the Ministry of Finance and Economy said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank opened its office in April 1998, appointing Sri-
Ram Aiyer as the country director in South Korea to review the
loan program.
</P>
<P>
It has loaned South Korea a total of 7 billion U.S. dollars
since the financial crisis in 1997 and provided 40 million U.S.
dollars through the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting) Trust Fund, which
was set up in 1998 to assist southeast Asian countries to overcome
the financial crisis, to support technology development.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Korean Economic Growth to Reach 8.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's economic growth is
expected to reach 8.6 percent this year despite a slower growth
rate in the latter half, the Korea Development Institute (KDI)
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the government-run think tank warned that the economy
may face a drastic downturn from next year if the ongoing
corporate restructuring fails to produce a substantive outcome.
</P>
<P>
"Should the government only focus on mitigating the credit
crunch through expansion of liquidity without removing the
insolvent factors of enterprises and financial institutes, the
national economy may face a serious setback," said KDI in a report.
</P>
<P>
Time is running out for South Korea to complete the corporate
restructuring as it will become more difficult to carry out
reforms under an economic decline, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The coming six months will be the critical period that will
determine the success or failure of the corporate restructuring,
it noted.
</P>
<P>
It put the restructuring in business sector over that of the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
"Although many financial institutions managed to decrease debts
due to injection of public funds, the debts incurred by
enterprises have remained the same as the pre-crisis level," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The think tank underlined the need to take resolute steps to
normalize the management of insolvent companies through transfer
of loans to investment.
</P>
<P>
It also forecast that the growth rate of South Korea's GDP,
which stood at 12.8 percent and 9.5 percent in the first and
second quarters, will decrease to 7.2 percent and 5.6 percent in
the third and fourth quarters, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Private sector consumption is projected to reach 8.2 percent on
an annual basis as the economic growth rate will drop in the
second half of this year amid decreases in virtual income and
stabilized asset prices, it said.
</P>
<P>
Exports are expected to continue to increase while imports will
also rise sharply due to increases in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus is likely to reach 9.5 billion U.S.
dollars this year, a drastic decline from last year's 25 billion.
</P>
<P>
The KDI estimates that the consumer commodity prices will
remain stable at 2.1 percent on an annual basis but the
inflationary pressure would rise in the latter half of this year
because of rising wages and public utility fares.
</P>
<P>
With the relatively favorable economic climate at present, the
corporate restructuring needs to be accelerated in the upcoming
six months to one year period, the last chance to achieve the
objective, added the institute.

<HEADLINE> Homesick Ambassadors Trounce Chinese All-Stars to Win ABA Super League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- the NBA Ambassadors, homesick yet
highly-motivated, gave the demoralized Chinese All-Stars a 103-68
beating in the deciding match of the best-of-three Asian
Basketball Association Super League here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The visitors dominated the court in every quarter and had once
extended their lead by 38 points even though two teams looked to
be on the same par after splitting their previous six encounters.
</P>
<P>
The two teams split the first two games of the finals. The
Ambassadors won 95-78 here on Monday and the Chinese All-Stars,
all Chinese internationals, made it one-all by beating the
Ambassadors 111-103 in Tianjin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Let's go home now," said the Ambassadors' top scorer Mike
Jones, who admitted he was homesick as much as his teammates after
leaving home for a month to play the ABA Super League which kicked
off on June 8.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who scored 19 points including 10 in the second quarter,
was one of six two-digit Ambassadors players. He also grabbed
seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Rasul Salahuddin, who garnered 33 points in Game Two,
contributed 16 points Thursday night. Wayman Strickland also
turned in 16 points. Matt Steigenga, Jason Dixon and Ross Land
snatched 14, 12 and 11 points respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dixon pulled down 11 rebounds to be the top rebounder of the
visitors.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassadors was rotating nine players, of whom Dixon had
teh longest playing time-26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
China's 7-footer center Wang Zhizhi, a 1999 second-round draft
pick of the Dallas Mavericks, pumped in 24 points and grabbed 11
rebounds, but he alone was not enough to save the All-Stars who
was outshot and out-rebounded by the faster and more agile
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Yao Ming, who stands 7-3, scored only 4 points in the first
half and was benched in the third quarter after his jaw was
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
China was beaten in every aspect. The Ambassadors snatched 40
rebounds against China's 29. China had 16 turnovers and 28 fouls
while the Americans had only 8 turnovers and 19 fouls.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassadors, coached by Hall of Fame point guard Nate "Tiny
" Archibald, had been pressuring the Chinese from teh very
beginning, leading 22-12 at the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The visitors, led by Jones, widened their lead to 55-25 at
halftime and kept a 78-49 lead after the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese had lagged by 38 points in the fourth quarter
before the Americans slackened off a bit in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned a lot from the NBA Ambassadors," said Chinese
head coach Jiang Xingquan. "We know how many weaknesses and
loopholes we have through the ABA Finals."
</P>
<P>
China will take on the American squad, hailed as "Dream Team",
in the opener of the Olympic basketball competition this summer.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
met with a visiting Taiwanese delegation of press leaders here
today.
</P>
<P>
Noting that media is an important window to the mainland for
Taiwanese compatriots, the vice-premier expressed his appreciation
of the positive role played by friends from the Taiwanese media
sector in promoting cross-Straits understanding and relationship.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, said the mainland has
always been in support of cross-Straits exchanges, including
exchanges between media organizations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that increasing people-to-people exchanges and co-
operations in economic, trade, culture, science and technology
across the Straits are providing a broader stage for Taiwanese
media to come to the mainland for both news reporting and
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier expressed his hope that Taiwanese media would
play a bigger role in promoting journalism exchange and the
relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that stabilizing and developing cross-Straits
relations is the common wish of the compatriots on both sides of
the Straits and that only by sticking to the One-China principle
could cross-Straits relations have a good development.
</P>
<P>
The mainland is willing to exchange opinions with Taiwanese
political parties, organizations and individuals on cross-Straits
relations and the peaceful reunification of the homeland, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that organizations from both sides would
work together for further improving cross-Straits relations by
strengthening bilateral exchanges, promoting mutual understanding
and expanding consensus.
</P>
<P>
The 19-member Taiwanese press delegation arrived in Beijing on
Monday for a four-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Meets U.S. Defense Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
emphasized here today that the proper settlement of the Taiwan
issue is the key to maintaining healthy and stable China-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian, in a meeting with visiting Defense Secretary of the
United States William Cohen, urged the U.S. to earnestly abide by
the three China-U.S. joint communiques and other commitments
related to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said this year is a key year for China-U.S. relations.
Realization of stable and improving China-U.S. relations this year
will have a very important significance to the healthy development
of the bilateral relations in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of China-U.S. relations is facing both
opportunities and challenges, referring to the meeting between the
two presidents during the United Nations Millennium Summit this
September.
</P>
<P>
On China-U.S. trade relations, Qian said exchanges between the
two countries in the field have seen great achievements. China-U.S.
trade relations will gain a vast range of prospects and benefit
people of the two countries if China enters the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and receives Permanent Normal Trade Relations (
PNTR) status at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the U.S. government has attached great importance to
the development of U.S.-China relations, and adhered to the One-
China policy. The U.S. government supports China's accession to
the WTO, and will commit to granting China's PNTR status as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes and believes that his visit to China will keep
bilateral military relations developing on a normal track.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also delivered a speech this morning at the Chinese
People's Liberation Army University of National Defense.

<HEADLINE> CMC Vice Chairman Meets U.S. Defense Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- With so many profound changes
taking place globally, Sino-U.S. relations need to advance on a
healthy, stable track, Zhang Wannian, vice chairman of the Central
Military Commission (CMC), told visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen during talks today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the continuing improvement of Sino-U.S.
relations has provided a favorable climate for the development of
the military relations of the two countries, and Secretary Cohen's
visit is further proof that the ties between the two militaries
have developed well.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Zhang said that the new leader of the
Taiwan authorities has adopted an attitude of reconciliation, but
has taken an evasive and vague attitude toward the One-China
principle.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities are not sincere about improving the
relations across the straits, he said, adding that the Chinese
government will "listen to his words and watch his deeds."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government's ground rules for
resolving the Taiwan issue are the principles of "peaceful
reunification, and one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
But China will not renounce the use of force, and the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) has the determination and capability to
smash any attempt to gain independence for Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the proper settlement of the Taiwan issue is
at the heart of the healthy, stable development of Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that the U.S. side would cautiously deal
with the issue of arms sales to Taiwan. He hoped that the U.S.
side would extend its vision to gain a clear perspective, and
review Sino-U.S. state and military relations from a long-term and
strategic point of view.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that the U.S. side is ready to improve bilateral
state and military relations. On the Taiwan issue, he said that
the U.S. side has always adhered to One-China principle, and will
not support Taiwan's independence.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets Niger Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The development of China-Niger
relations proves that the promotion of friendship and cooperation
between the two countries conforms to the fundamental interests of
the two peoples, said a senior official of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) here today.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the remark in a meeting
with Sekou Hamidou, president of Niger's National Movement for the
Society of Development (MNSD-NASSARA), and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, said bilateral cooperation in various fields has been
progressing since the restoration of diplomatic relations between
the two countries in 1996 and friendship between the two peoples
has deepened, although there was a time of twists and turns in
bilateral relations after the establishment of diplomatic
relations in 1974.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that through joint efforts, China-Niger
friendship and cooperation will develop further in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of friendly relations between the CPC and the
MNSD-NASSARA, he said increased exchanges and study of each other'
s ruling experience will be conducive to their respective national
development, and the further development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Sekou said Niger and many other African countries have had
close relations with China, because African countries and China
have similar histories and common tasks, and China stands by the
African people in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
He said China is a multi-nationality and multi-culture country,
and China's national unity left a deep impression on his
delegation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that the Chinese people will score
even more achievements, and achieve the complete reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is visiting China at the CPC's invitation.

<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that a healthy and stable growth of Sino-U.S. relations
not only accords with the fundamental interests of the people of
the two countries, but also is conducive to the peace in the Asia-
Pacific and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission,
made the remarks today while meeting with visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the two governments and leaders of the two
countries should proceed from a strategic, long-term perspective
as they guide the course of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations should be properly handled on the basis of
the three joint communiques between the two countries and in the
spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and seeking
common ground while reserving differences, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Jiang said that the Taiwan issue is China'
s internal affair, adding that the one-China principle is the
prerequisite for the peaceful solution of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Taiwan sticks to the one-China principle is a
test of its sincerity to conduct dialogue, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that as long as the new leader of the Taiwan
region accepts the one-China principle, the dialogue and talks
across the Taiwan Straits can be resumed and everything can be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the Taiwan issue is the most important and
most sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government and far-sighted statesmen should proceed
from the comprehensive situation in Sino-U.S. relations, strictly
observe the three joint communiques between the two countries and
relevant commitments made by the U.S. side, and make a wise choice,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that the purpose of his current visit to China is to
promote the ties between the armed forces of the two countries,
adding that he believes the visit will be helpful to the long-term
positive development of the relations between the two countries
and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. and China share a lot of common interests,
adding that a good U.S.-China relationship will benefit the Asia-
Pacific region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that the U.S. government adheres to the one-China
policy and observes the three joint communiques between the two
countries and relevant U.S. commitments.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side does not support Taiwan independence, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission
and Chinese minister of national defense, was among those present
on the occasion.

<HEADLINE> More Israelis Support Barak's Peace Move: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- More Israeli people have shown
their support for Prime Minister Ehud Barak's peace move, but said
it is hard for Barak to bring home a peace agreement with the
Palestinians from the Camp David summit, the results of an opinion
poll indicate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted on 522 Israelis by a local firm for Israel
Radio on Tuesday when the Camp David summit began, showed support
for Barak's peace move has risen by 8 percent to 60.1 percent from
the previous poll on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Among those interviewed, only 30.9 percent thought the summit
will end in a deal and 18.5 percent did not know or refused to
answer. Some 53.7 percent respondents said Barak has a mandate to
make concessions, up from 53 percent in Sunday's poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll gave Barak a boost if elections were held right now
against former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with 45.5 percent
saying they will vote for Barak and 34.2 percent for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The results of the new poll represents a significant jump for
Barak, who trailed Netanyahu in a poll taken last month.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are holding their
summit at Camp David near Washington with U.S. President Bill
Clinton to solve the key issues such as the status of Jerusalem,
borders, refugees, Jewish settlements and water.
</P>
<P>
The summit is aimed at reaching a framework agreement on all
these issues ahead of a September 13 deadline for a final peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
Three coalition partners left Barak's government on Sunday in
protest against Barak's attendance at the summit, leaving Barak
with a minority in the Knesset (parliament).

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore authorities seized
more than one million pirated articles and apprehended over 800
persons in their anti-piracy actions in the first half of this
year, officials from Singapore's Trade Development Board (TDB) and
the police told a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They said the enforcement units conducted a total of 1,147
raids on shopping centers, storage locations and makeshift stalls
and recovered infringing products with market value of some eight
million Singapore dollars (about 4.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the same period last year, 1,228 raids were conducted and a
total of 680,858 infringing articles were seized.
</P>

piracy efforts, noting the police have upgraded the Intellectual
Property Rights (IPR) Warrant Unit to a branch level and the newly
established Intellectual Property Rights Branch (IPRB) has also
been moved from the Commercial Crime Division to the Specialized
Crime Division of the Criminal Investigation Department.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Forms Committee to Deal with Deviationists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has formed an Action
and Monitoring Committee to handle investigations relating to
deviationist groups and the detention of their members, Minister
in the Prime Minister's Department Abdul Hamid Othman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the authorities' new approach in checking the spread of
deviationist teachings in the country, he told reporters at
Parliament House lobby here.
</P>
<P>
He said the government finds it necessary to adopt the new
approach to avoid the recurrence of arms heists as those staged by
members of the Al-Ma'unah deviationist group in Gerik in the
northern state of Perak early this month.
</P>
<P>
"We now have to monitor all existing religious organizations,"
he said, urging the Registrar of Societies to alert the Department
of Islamic Advancement and the police about religious
organizations indulging in dubious activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the authorities could come up with a special
program to rehabilitate members led astray by deviationist groups
to return to true religious teachings.
</P>
<P>
The committee is made up of police and officers of the
department of Islamic advancement and state religious affairs
departments.
</P>
<P>
Earlier only religious department officers were involved in
investigating suspected deviant groups, he said, adding the
previous process was rather time-consuming as it involved much
persuasion to steer those concerned back to the correct path.

<HEADLINE> Manila Moves to Upgrade Skills of Women Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government pushed
Thursday for the upgrading of women workers' skills to help them
land in remunerative and better paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said it is currently hard
for women without training or education to find employment.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report from the Bureau of Labor and Employment
Statistics (BLES Laguesma said women employed with elementary or
low level of education decreased from 44 percent of the total
employed women in 1989 to 36.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said the BLES data showed that employed women with high
school and college education rose from 26.6 percent and 25 percent
in 1989 to 31.7 percent and 28.5 percent in 1999 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Data also showed that more employed women were agricultural
workers accounting for 28.1 percent, followed by women in sales
for 26.1 percent, service for 15.9 percent, production for 11
percent, clerical for 6.9 percent, and managerial position for 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The data indicated the need to train women in various skills to
enable them find better jobs or engage in livelihood, Laguesma
stressed.
</P>
<P>
To address the need, Laguesma said the Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE) has intensified its programs to promote the
employability of women workers.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE's Bureau of Women and Young Workers, in its report to
Laguesma, said it focused its assistance to women along with the
efforts to train women in entrepreneurial and other skills.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Inflicts Serious Socio-Economic Losses: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries'
wealth will be reduced by 15 to 20 percent over the next 10 years
as a result of HIV/AIDS, according to new research presented on
Thursday by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
This will impose serious socioeconomic costs on the economies
of these countries, the world bank said in a report at the 13th
International Conference on HIV-AIDS in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Citing growing evidence, the report said lower economic growth
and increased poverty threatens to form a vicious cycle in which
HIV-AIDS drives many families into deepening poverty, and at the
same time poverty speeds the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
Breaking this cycle will require not only greatly increased
investments in more effective HIV prevention and care, but also
more effective measures to combat poverty, participants agreed,
said Robert Hecht, UNAIDS Associate Director for Policy, Strategy
and Research.
</P>
<P>
World Bank's Vice-President Callisto Madavo announced that the
World Bank was developing a 500-million-U.S.-dollar fund to help
African governments pay for expanded AIDS programs.
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with the epidemic requires money and commitment -- and
it also requires knowledge", said Madavo.
</P>
<P>
"We will be drawing on what you have learned in helping
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Three new studies presented at the symposium suggest that high
levels of HIV infection do significantly reduce growth, making it
harder for countries to reduce poverty and to generate the
resources needed to cope with the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Southern African countries are the hardest hit by HIV/AIDS,
with an estimated 25 million AIDS sufferers. In South Africa, an
estimated 20 percent of the population is infected with HIV, and
because of this, researchers forecast that the country's GDP will
be 17 percent lower by 2010 than it would have been without an
epidemic. Individual families will also find their incomes reduced.
</P>
<P>
Another study on Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago also warned
that AIDS would significantly harm economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a study of diamond-rich Botswana, which has the
world's highest incidence of HIV, with 36 percent of its adult
population infected, warned that the country would face "a rapid
increase in the number of very poor and destitute households in
the coming decade."
</P>
<P>
Although income from diamond exports would cushion the impact
on GDP growth, per capita household income for the poorest quarter
of all households is likely to fall by 13 percent, the study said.

<P>
TAIYUAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The moisture in the air may help
north China's Shanxi province relieve its acute water shortage,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
A group of scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences
concluded after recently doing research in the province that
exploiting water resources in the air can be a sustainable way to
solve water scarcity in north China.
</P>
<P>
Based on advice of the scientists, the provincial government
has made a six-year plan to develop weather modification
technologies, mainly seeding clouds to increase precipitation.
</P>
<P>
The province will strive increase its annual rainfall by 2 to 3
billion cu m a year.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi is among one of the most arid provinces in China, with
about 4 million people and nearly 1 million head of livestock
being affected every year. Dry weather also leads reduced grain
harvest, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, Shanxi has been seeding clouds to
increase precipitation by 600 million to 800 million cu m a year.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Pursue Peace Despite MILF's Call for Holy War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it is ready to pursue just and lasting peace in
Mindanao despite the call of the leadership of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) for a holy war against the government.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech that
this goal remains President Joseph Estrada's top priority for
Mindanao, which his administration is determined to transform into
the country's food basket.
</P>
<P>
"We are still determined to pursue peace and we will do that
with or without the MILF," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He also described as a big mistake the decision of the MILF
leadership to call for a jihad (holy war), stressing anew that the
government is not at war with the Bangsamoro people.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government will not force the MILF to accept
peace, but is ready to respond to any abuse that the group may
commit against the people.
</P>
<P>
"If they want war, how will we respond to that? We cannot force
them to accept peace if they don't want it," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada, Zamora said, is set to convene the Mindanao
Coordinating Council (MCC) to discuss the problem in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting would include the drafting of a proposed
measure to be submitted to Congress seeking extra powers for the
president to speed up the implementation of development projects
in the south.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the president described the declaration of a holy
war by MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat as unwarranted, saying that
the government has not declared war against the Bangsamoro people.
</P>
<P>
The President said that as Commander in Chief of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines (AFP), he had only ordered government
troops to step up efforts in running after MILF rebels "who have
violated the ceasefire agreement who committed other criminal or
illegal acts."
</P>
<P>
The president was reacting to the reported call by Salamat for
his people to rise in jihad or armed struggle against the
government, after the fall of Camp Abubakar, the MILF's main
headquarters, to government hands early this week.

LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Authorities of the southern Nigeria'
s Delta State, where some 250 people died in a fuel pipeline fire,
have appealed for the wounded to come forward for hospital
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Most of the injured have reportedly sought help from
traditional doctors because they fear arrest on suspicion of
stealing oil if they attend hospitals, reported Nigerian press on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the state's capital Asaba, Governor James Ibori appeal on a
local radio late on Wednesday that they would not be arrested.

along a stretch of pipeline between the villages of Adeje and
Ovire Court outside Warri, a major oil town in the south of Africa
's largest oil-exporting country.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened when people were using buckets to
collect petrol flowing from the pipeline after it had been
punctured by thieves on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The blaze flared up again after a second smaller explosion on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Warri quoted a local senior police
officer as saying that "an exact toll is unlikely to be clear for
some time but we know more than 250 people have died."
</P>
<P>
Doyin Okupe, President Olusegun Obasanjo's spokesman,
reportedly called on Wednesday the disaster an "avoidable tragedy"

SHANGHAI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai witnessed a sharp
increase in exports and also a rise in foreign investment in the
first half of the year, official statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period, exports by this largest industrial
and commercial center of China amounted to 11.69 billion U.S.
dollars, compared with 8.035 billion U.S. dollars in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Shanghai has also reversed the trend of
decline, due to the growth of the world economy, said Zhu Xiaoming,
director of Shanghai Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, the number of approved
overseas-funded projects, contractual overseas investment and
realized overseas investment increased 12.6 percent, 6.3 percent
and 5.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the rise of exports and foreign investment shows that
Shanghai has got out of the shadow of Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai's foreign trade companies are making preparations for
China's accession to the World Trade Organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year, Shanghai's exports may surpass 22 billion U.S.
dollars and the city may attract more than 4.5 billion U.S.
dollars of contractual overseas investment, he predicted.
</P>

ray some dubious paper-like items wrapped in two bags in his
suitcase. The items proved to be 500,000 U.S. dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
The man, surnamed Cheng, had not declared the cash to the
customs. He later claimed that the cash was brought into China
from abroad by himself and he planned to buy a house with the
money in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The case is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Chinadotcom to Be Profitable by End of 2001: SSB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinadotcom Corporation, the
first Asian Internet company listed on Nasdaq, is forecast to
become profitable by the end of next year, according to a report
released here Thursday by two Internet analysts of the Salomon
Smith Barney (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Pete Hitchen, SSB's Regional Internet Research Analyst, and
Pratik Gupta, SSB's Head of Regional Internet Research, expect the
company to incur losses in the near term given the build-out of
operating infrastructure in all divisions of the company.
</P>
<P>
"But with revenues expected from multiple sources in the medium
to long term, we expect Chinadotcom to be one of Asia's first
profitable Internet plays. Based on current estimates, we expect
Chinadotcom to be net-income positive by the fourth quarter of
2001," they said.
</P>
<P>
The report expects Chinadotcom's revenues to increase at a
compound average growth rate of 132 percent over the next two
years, driven mainly by web services and online advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
They believe that Chinadotcom's expanding portal network will
have to depend mostly on advertising revenue in the near term, as
the market in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan is at a
less mature stage in terms of online transactions and,
consequently, e-commerce revenues.
</P>
<P>
Chinadotcom recorded 561 million U.S. dollars in liquid funds
as of the end of the first quarter of 2000, with an average
monthly burn rate of only 3 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"With many dotcoms in Asia unable to source funding,
Chinadotcom is in a strong position to play the role of a major
consolidator by acquiring companies that will fit in with its
portfolio of companies," said Hitchen and Gupta.

<HEADLINE> China Closely Monitoring Red Tide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China's State Oceanic
Administration has called on the coastal areas to strengthen their
round-the-clock monitoring against red tide, which kills fish and
other organisms in sea waters.
</P>
<P>
The urgent call was made with the approaching of the season of
red tide outbreak in offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
A number of large-scale red tides have been reported at the
Zhoushan Islands, east China's Zhejiang Province, since May, said
Li Hang, an official from the China Maritime Supervision Corps.
</P>
<P>
And outbreak of large-scale red tides is possible in Bohai sea
area in July and August, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that about 20 to 30 red tides are expected to
occur this year in the coastal sea waters, and aquacultural and
sewage discharge areas as well as ports are listed as the most
dangerous regions.
</P>
<P>
Satellite remote sensing technology is used to monitor red
tides in China's coastal areas, together with planes and ships.
</P>
<P>
A red tide is a dense population of aquatic microscopic
organisms that breed in the abundance of salt in surface water.
The micro-organisms appear in most of the world's waters and most
are harmless. However, some single-cell organisms produce a poison
that paralyzes and kills fish. These organisms may also suffocate
fish by consuming nearly all the oxygen in the water.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, red tide is mainly caused by pollution
from land and the large-scale farming in coastal waters, which
produce too much nitrogen and phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
China has experienced increasing red tides off the coast since
the 1990s due to increasing pollution caused by industrial waste
water, according to a recent report issued by the State Oceanic
Administration.
</P>
<P>
China registered more than 200 red tides in the past decade. A
total of 45 large-scale red tides occurred between 1997 and 1999,
causing direct economic losses of 240 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Affected by Global Warming: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The temperatures of the world will
continue to rise in the next 30 years and China will be no
exception, according to a leading Chinese scientist here.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, much of the world has been hit by waves of
heat. The Chinese capital of Beijing has already witnessed
temperatures above the major psychological mark of 40 Celsius
degrees C.
</P>
<P>
Many people began to wonder if the temperature will continue to
go up in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Atmospheric physicist Ye Duzheng said that the world
temperature has been on the rise over the past century and will
continue to climb.
</P>
<P>
Observation showed that the average temperature of the globe is
0.5 degrees higher than that of the beginning of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Many scientists agreed that the world's temperature is expected
to continue to go up as a result of an increased amount of
greenhouse effect gases, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that around the year of 2030, the average
winter temperature in north China is expected to rise one to 1.5
Celsius degrees, while the summer temperature to rise 0.5 to 0.8
degrees.
</P>
<P>
The rise of temperatures, especially in winter, will bring a
host of changes to the nature and the human society.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists are studying how to cope with the changes
and how to maintain sustained social and economic developments of
the country, Ye said.

<HEADLINE> 70% Zimbabwean Families Live Below Poverty Line  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The living conditions of
Zimbabweans have worsened with up to 70 percent of families now
living beyond their means owing to the prevailing economic
hardship, the weekly Business reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) shows
that a family of six needs at least 9,000 Zimbabwean dollars (236
U.S. dollars) to buy a month's basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
CCZ regional manager Victor Chisi said many workers could not
afford this, which meant that the majority of people were living
below the poverty datum line.
</P>
<P>
Chisi said, "This basically means that a lot of Zimbabweans go
without basic consumer needs and goods."
</P>
<P>
"This has been worsened by manufacturers and suppliers of
consumer goods who now increase prices of commodities arbitrarily
in pursuit of their sectoral needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Consumers have been reeling from economic hardship
characterized by a high inflation rate of 70 percent and a severe
shortage of foreign currency, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Egypt in Trade Dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The trade dispute between Kenya
and Egypt has taken a new twist with Egypt vowing to institute a
33-percent levy on Kenyan tea following a 33-percent suspended
duty on Egyptian products levied by Kenya, Kenyan media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to Kenya Refaat al-Ansary Wednesday told
the press here that the consignment of Kenyan tea currently held
at Port Said in Egypt would not allowed into the Egyptian market
until the tariff stalemate is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Egypt on Monday moved to block Kenyan tea imports into its
domestic market after Kenya imposed the suspended duty on Egyptian
rice which was one of the recommendations in Kenya's June 15
budget.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said there were 52 commodities from Egypt to
Kenya which do not enjoy preferential treatment under the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Both Kenya and Egypt are COMESA members.
</P>
<P>
Refaat al-Ansary appealed to Kenyan authorities to remove all
barriers to bilateral trade and stick to COMESA regulations on
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Egypt had consulted the matter with Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi who agreed to take up the issue with the
relevant ministries to ensure it was brought to a conclusion
agreeable to both countries.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that currently a big trade imbalance exists
between the two countries with Kenya being the beneficiary. Egypt
is the third biggest consumer of Kenyan tea after Pakistan and
Britain.

hostage crisis in the southern Philippine island of Jolo as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf has been holding 37 hostages
for 12 weeks and kidnapped three French television journalists
last week. The 37 hostages include five French citizens, four
Germans, two Finns, two South Africans and one Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Chirac expressed deep concern about the
situation of the 40 hostages and his hope that "all would be done
to seek a happy and quick solution," said Colonna.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting last week with the family of one of the French
hostages, Chirac said that he will make an initiative "at European
level" to seek the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, scheduled to arrive in Manila Thursday with German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and Finnish Foreign Minister
Errki Tuomioja, will ask the Philippine authorities to "intensify"
talks with the Muslim rebel group.
</P>
<P>
They will also ask the Philippine authorities not to resort to
force to liberate the hostages and to keep the "humanitarian
corridor" open for sending food and medicines to the hostages.

<HEADLINE> China Cutting Down Coal Production, Stockpile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China has made headway in the
efforts to reduce coal production and stockpiles for balanced
supply and demand and keep this year's coal output within 900
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianzheng, deputy director of the State Administration of
Coal Industry, said here today that so far the number of legal
coal production enterprises has been cut down from 300,000 to 80,
000 nationwide, with a large number of illegal small coal mines
closed down.
</P>
<P>
The situation of coal supply exceeding demand has also been
eased to some degree, he added.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the country's large state-owned coal
enterprises will take further steps in the latter half of this
year to produce according to market demand, adjust their product
mix, and lower production costs in a bid to turn losses into
profits.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Plan for Development of New and Renewable Energy Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC) has worked out a plan on the development of new
and renewable energy resources in the next 15 years, according to
an SETC official.
</P>
<P>
Bai Rongchun, director in charge of the resources utilization
under the SETC, said by 2015 China will annually develop new and
renewable energy resources amounting to 43 million tons of coal
equivalent (TCE), accounting for two percent of the country's
total energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
With the new and renewable energy resources, the country's coal
consumption will be cut by 60 million tons, which will amount to
reduction of pollutants including 30 million tons of carbon
dioxide and 2.1 million tons of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides
and soot.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the volume of China's annual exploitation and
utilization of new and renewable energy resources amount to three
million TCE, accounting for about 0.2 percent of the total
commercial energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the largest energy producers and consumers,
especially the world's largest coal consumer, said Bai at a press
conference held here today. He noted that heavy reliance on coal
has had severe environmental impacts.
</P>
<P>
Bai noted that China has made great efforts in the past years
to readjust its energy utilization structure and decided to take
effective measures to solve the energy problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the new plan, by the year 2015, the annual output
of new energy development and of related equipment manufacturing
will reach nearly 67 billion yuan. The industry as a whole will
provide nearly 0.5 million job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
To promote the development of new energy resources, the SETC
and five other departments will jointly sponsor the International
Environment, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Exhibition and
Conference, to be held on November 28-December 1.

BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan is doomed to failure in its
effort to enter the United Nations whatever tricks it will play,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said today.
</P>
<P>
As a province of China, Taiwan has no qualification to enter

The spokesman reiterated that the United Nations, an inter-

<P>
"The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate one representing China, and Taiwan cannot enter the U.N.
and all of its agencies under any names and through any methods."
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the General Committee of each U.N. General Assembly
has refused to include the so-called representation of Taiwan in

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Reopen Second Largest Pyramid of Famous Giza Trio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will soon reopen the second
largest pyramid of the Giza trio on the outskirts of Cairo after a
year-long facelift involving scraping salt, lipstick and graffiti
off the inner walls, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The restoration work on the 4,500-year-old pyramid of Khafra,
also known as Khefren, has just finished and tourists will now see
an even more impressive display than before, said Zahi Hawas,
director of Giza pyramids and antiquities.
</P>
<P>
The lighting system inside the 136-meter high structure has been
rearranged in a way that enhances the magic and mystery for
visitors, the English-language newspaper quoted Hawas as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cracks have been patched up by using sand, water and rock chalk,
the same building materials used by the ancient Egyptians, and
cameras will now monitor tourists to catch graffiti artists and
visitors who leave lipstick kisses and marks on the walls, the
guardian of the pyramids said.
</P>
<P>
The salt deposits resulted from the water vapour in the breath
of visitors, each of whom produces about 20 grams, Hawas said. He
added a new ventilation system has been installed to reduce
humidity and improve the air quality for visitors to the monument.
</P>
<P>
Hawas said a limit will be set on the number of visitors as it
had been when the largest pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) was reopened in
June 1999 after restoration. Before it was closed for a facelift,
Khufu's Pyramid attracted more than 4,000 tourists each day,
prompting safety concerns. Now, only 300 people are allowed in
every day.
</P>
<P>
The pyramid of Menkaure (Mykerinos), the smallest of the famous
trio on the Giza plateau, is next in line for temporary closure
under a restoration scheme for the three pyramids started in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Knesset (Parliament) members from the ultra-Orthodox
Shas party defied the Supreme Court ruling Wednesday on former Shas
leader Aryeh Deri and vowed that he "will always lead" the
movement, even as he enters prison to serve a three-year term.
</P>
<P>
Knesset faction chairman Yari Peretz explained that the faction
decision does not mean that Deri will return to the chairmanship,
but rather that he will be "a partner and active" in party affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Shas faction met Wednesday afternoon in "urgent" session to
discuss the court ruling. A statement released afterward said "we
are all in anguish over the appalling discrimination," repeating
the theme that Deri has not been given a fair trial because of his
Sephardi origin.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will propose a "relatively
high degree of autonomy" for the Palestinian neighborhoods in
Jerusalem, as well as an exchange of territory in which some Jewish
neighborhoods near Jerusalem will be incorporated into the Holy
City in exchange for the transfer of some of the Palestinian
neighborhoods to the area of the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Alpher, Barak's special advisor on media relations for
the summit talks, said "everything related to Jerusalem is on the
table" but that the Jerusalem issue is the hardest in the
negotiations, and it is not certain that agreement will be reached.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's former Shas party leader Aryeh Deri will spend his
last month of freedom before entering prison on August 13 to serve
a three-year term by appearing in a series of Shas rallies around
the country, in order to take leave of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court Wednesday upheld the Shas leader's conviction
of bribery, but reduced his sentence from four to three years. He
can be free in two years, depending on his good behavior.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the court hearing, Deri went to Shas spiritual
leader Rabbi Yosef's home, where he called for "unity" in Shas
ranks and an end to the party's factionalism. He also attacked
Barak's government and then the secular Israelis, "who cannot bear
the idea that the Sephardi public is returning to religion."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued a brief statement
from Camp David following the Supreme Court's ruling on former Shas
party leader Aryeh Deri's appeal on Wednesday, saying he "regrets
that the Deri family is facing a difficult period, but Israel is a
law-abiding state and we must all respect the decision of the
court."
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said it was a "sad moment" when,
for the first time in Israel's history, an individual who served as
a cabinet minister, will serve time in prison. Beilin urged the
politicians "to display public responsibility and prevent
incitement and rifts in the society."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President Undergoes Final Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto underwent investigation again on Thursday for corruption
charges at his residence in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"Prosecutors gave Soeharto some simple questions due to the
poor condition of Pak Harto (Mr. Soeharto)," Soeharto's lawyer
Juan Felix Tampubolon told reporters after the questioning, adding
that Thursday's investigation was the final one.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Attorney General's Office (AGO) Yushar Yahya
told Xinhua that there was a new development in Soeharto's case.
</P>
<P>
"But for the time being we think that is enough," he added
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Yahya also said that dossier of Soeharto in corruption cases
will be submitted to the court before Soeharto's house arrest
status expires on August 10.
</P>
<P>
"And in connection with Soeharto's healthy condition, the court
has to decide whether or not Soeharto would be tried. Just wait,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was suspected of abusing power and authority by
issuing decrees and government regulations to amass funds through
seven tax-free charity foundations he set up and chaired during
his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
He was put under house arrest and has been banned from leaving
the country since May.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has pledged to try Soeharto
before August 10 this year or before the country's highest
decision-making body of the People's Consultatives Assembly (MPR)
hold its annual session scheduled for August 7.

<P>
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of people killed in the
dumpsite avalanche that occurred Monday in Payatas, Metro Manila,
has climbed to 137 as of 02:00 a.m. Thursday, the Philippine
government said.
</P>
<P>
The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) said 89

There were about 50,000 people residing in Payatas. The open
dumpsite was scheduled to be closed in October 1999, but the
closure was held back for lack of an alternative disposal site for
Quezon City's more than 700 tons of daily garbage.
</P>
<P>
Due to a week of continuous monsoon rains, the tons of garbage
must have loosened which resulted in its erosion and eventually
became a landslide, said Mathay.
</P>
<P>
The military officials said military dogs used in the Mindanao
campaign would soon be deployed in assisting military and rescue
personnel in locating bodies buried.
</P>
<P>
The dogs were earlier used in sniffing bombs and land mines
planted by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Defense Secretary and NDCC Chairman Orlando
Mercado said the government could not give a time frame as to when
recovery efforts would stop.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Welcomes Release of Hostages in Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark and Foreign Minister Phil Goff said here Thursday
night that the release unharmed of the hostages in Fiji came as "a
tremendous relief."
</P>
<P>
But they said Fiji "remains far from a return to democratic
government."
</P>
<P>
In a government press release, Clark and Goff noted there's
evidence that Fiji is sliding towards anarchy.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand has signaled clearly in the last few weeks that
the installation of a government in Fiji which lacks a basic
commitment to democracy will lead to the application of a number
of measures against Fiji," they said.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to urge the Great Council of Chiefs to show
leadership and display wisdom in signaling a desire to return to a
democratic government and constitution as soon as possible," they
added.
</P>
<P>
"If there are signs of goodwill, New Zealand will work with,
encourage and support a new administration. If not, and there is
instead an ultra-nationalist regime denying basic human rights to
many, New Zealand will bring into force a range of sanctions," the
New Zealand leaders said.

<P>
However, many investors sold iron and steel stocks afterwards

climbed up and fluctuated all day, according to Beijing-based on-

market as investors became more confident about China's economic
growth this year, Homeway analysts said.

BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China's T-bond extended the narrow

totaled 1.36 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that 010004 finally climbed up 0.11 percent to

All the other bonds fluctuated within a narrow range of less

</P>
<P>
The stock indices on the two bourses closed up at new record

<HEADLINE> Motherland Party Leader to Join Turkish Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the ruling
partner Motherland Party (ANAP), will be appointed state minister
for European Union Affairs after the parliament recently cleared
him of corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
In a 40-minute talks with Yilmaz Wednesday, Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit invited him to take up the vacant seat in his three-
way coalition government, Anatolia News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz accepted the offer. It was expected that the decision
will be presented to President Ahmet Necdet Sezer for approval on
Thursday, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Last year when Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party
(DSP), formed the current coalition together with Deputy Prime
Minister Develet Bahceli's Nationalist Action Party (MHP) and
Yilmaz's ANAP, the ANAP leader rejected a role in the cabinet as he
was facing eight corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who had served as prime minister three times, was
accused of abusing power for self-interests during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Last month, tension was brewing in Ankara once again as three
MHP deputies joined the opposition deputies in a parliamentary
investigation commission in a bid to file Yilmaz to the Supreme
Court over allegations of graft.
</P>
<P>
The move soured relations between ANAP and MHP, the two ruling
partners, and jeopardized the coalition's stability which Ecevit
has strived for and was imperative for his economic reforms
program.
</P>
<P>
Rumors emerged that MHP and ANAP are trying to damage each other
as a part of their election strategy as both parties are aiming to
woo nationalist and conservative votes, in the absence of the pro-
Islamic opposition Virtue Party (FP).
</P>
<P>
The possibility of an early election is real because Turkish
Constitutional Court will decide whether FP is the successor to the
defunct Islamic Welfare Party or not in October.
</P>
<P>
If the court makes a "yes" verdict, the FP will be closed and 70
of the 103 FP deputies in the 550-member parliament will be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Under Turkey's Constitution, if five percent, or about 28 of the
parliament's deputies are absent, an early parliamentary election
should be held within three months.
</P>
<P>
After the decision to send Yilmaz to the Supreme Court for trial
on graft charges failed in the parliament, the coalition left
behind the tension, if tentatively.
</P>
<P>
Also, the vote in the parliament meant to have cleared Yilmaz of
the corruption allegations, paving the way for his entry into the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"Mesut Yilmaz is an experienced statesman with time in the
government. This is a great advantage, ensuring coordination among
public and private institutions," said Ecevit.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen expressed his satisfaction and appreciation to a gathering of
military police on Thursday that the unit had committed hard work
to help stabilizing the country's political and security sectors.
</P>
<P>
"I really appreciate the hard work of the military police on
their three missions so far on administration, justice and
military," Hun Sen said at a show of the military police's skills
at the Kambol training center, seven kilometers west of Phnom Penh.

Meanwhile, Hun Sen appealed to all military police to respect
religion and the King, and to serve the interests of the nation as
well as to respect human rights, democracy and laws.
</P>
<P>
When the first coalition government was set up in 1993 by the

personnel in the military police, but currently, the number has
risen to 7,110, said Sao Sokha, head of the military police.
</P>
<P>
Military police have been trained on various respects of
professionalism, including military skills, knowledge of laws and
democracy as well as human rights.
</P>
<P>
Military police have been seen as one of the most competent
authorities to protect social order, especially to fight against
crimes in this country.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Fiji's Hostage Crisis Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's deposed Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry and 17 of his colleagues were released on
Thursday after being held in hostage for 56 days, the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry and his colleagues were then escorted to the Red Cross
headquarters and reunited with their families, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister's wife, Vimira Chaudhry, was among a
crowd of about 300 friends, media and onlookers, many of whom
cheered and clapped as all of the former hostages arrived.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another former prime minister and now chairman of
the Great Council of Chiefs, Sitiveni Rabuka, is expected to
announce the chiefs' nomination for the country's president later
Thursday evening, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs issued an ultimatum to
the coup plotters over the release of the hostages, according to
the ABC.
</P>
<P>
They told George Speight's coup group that if they did not free
the hostages soon, they would lose immunity from prosecution,
promised in an agreement aimed at solving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before the release of the remaining hostages at the parliament
compound in Fiji's capital Suva, Speight conducted a traditional
ceremony asking for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry was given a bowl of kava and shook hands with Speight
before leaving, the ABC reported.
</P>
<P>
Journalists had been refused entry to the parliament compound
and army checkpoints are also turning back the media.
</P>
<P>
Police have shut off the area in front of the Red Cross
headquarters where the 18 former hostages would be given a medical
check-up.
</P>
<P>
Under an accord reached by Speight and Fiji's military last
Sunday, the 50-strong Great Council of Chiefs was to meet on
Thursday to name a new president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
In return, Speight was committed to releasing all the hostages,
including Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Ports Urged to Upgrade Service Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian ports has been
urged to improve productivity and upgrade service quality through
information technology (IT) applications such as computerized
container terminal management systems and web-based transaction
systems.
</P>
<P>
To become a major regional hub, the major ports in the country
should improve their operational efficiency, manpower training,
infrastructure development and ship planning, the Productivity
Report 1999 released here Thursday by the National Productivity
corporation (NPC) said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian ports were affected by the 1998 economic downturn and
the volume of cargoes handled in that year came down by 13.3
percent to 159.299 million tons against 183.645 million tons in
1997.
</P>
<P>
There was a marginal decrease in shipcalls to the country's 13
major ports with 51,183 ships in 1998 from 59,214 ships in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the performance of the port industry continued to
improve throughout the year following steps taken by port
operators and the government, including implementing programs to
improve productivity and quality at all levels of port operations
and greater promotion of local ports.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, added value per employee grew 1.8
percent to 87,440 ringgit (23,010 U.S. dollars) in 1998 thanks to
management efficiency, positive work attitude or quality programs.
</P>
<P>
And as for the competitiveness of labour cost, added value per
labor cost declined 2.78 percent in 1998, labor cost per employee
grew 3.1 percent while unit labor cost increased 2.1 percent,
indicating that higher labor cost did not commensurate with added
value creation, the NPC said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Union, Africans' Dream in New Century by Zhang Dacheng and Liu Hao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 13 (Xinhua) -- As African leaders met in the
Atlantic town of Lome, Togo, to convene the 36th summit of the
heads of state and government of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), establishment of a more integrated regional body, the
African Union, to replace OAU has come on the top of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
The OAU, founded by the forerunners of Pan-Africanism in the
early 1960s, has been playing a key role in guiding Africans in
wiping out colonialism and racism and ushering in a new era of
self-reliance and development.
</P>
<P>
Now that nearly four decades have passed, Africa found itself
in a tight corner in a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
When the world economy developed so fast in the tide of
globalization, Africa has been dragged into endless armed
conflicts, facing such burdens as a great amount of refugees,
heavy debt, unbridled spread of HIV/AIDS and uncontrolled
population growth among others.
</P>
<P>
To face ever-increasing new challenges from the outside world,
African leaders gradually have reached the consensus that, Africa
needs a continental organ which is more powerful than OAU in all
sectors.
</P>
<P>
A solution was found on September 9, 1999 when the OAU leaders
gathered in the small town of Sirte, Libya and approved the well-
known Sirte Declaration which advocates the establishment of the
African Union.
</P>
<P>
Following deliberations at ministerial level, the leaders who
attended the 36th OAU summit from July 10-12, this year, signed
the Draft Constitutive Act of the African Union, officially
starting the process for establishing the Union.
</P>
<P>
The main characteristic of the African Union is that with a
more reasonable organizational structure, it was authorized more
power and rights. As a leading continental organ, the African
Union will be in charge of the political, economic, military,
social and cultural affairs of the continent to accelerate
political, economic and social integration and to maintain peace,
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Leaders at the OAU Lome summit have agreed to improve the
African Union by setting up it first, although some of them are
worried that conditions are not ripe for such a speedy stride in
establishing the Union.
</P>
<P>
The OAU summit decided to hold the fourth extra-ordinary summit
in March next year in Sirte, Libya again to review the
ratification by member states of the Draft Act, which says that
the Union can be set up only when the Act is ratified by more than
two thirds of the member states.
</P>
<P>
Once coming into being, the African Union is expected to
sharpen Africa's competitive edge and to prevent the continent
from being marginalized.
</P>
<P>
At the very beginning of a new century as well as a new
millennium, the Africans are sparing no effort in establishing
their Union, a major step forward to their long-expected dream of
a Unites States of Africa.

<HEADLINE> Unlawful Driving More Likely Involved in Road Accidents: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 12 (Xinhua) -- One of every five fatal car
crashes in the United States involves a driver who is not properly
licensed, a traffic safety group reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The findings by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety are an
analysis of 183,749 fatal crashes between 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The study concludes that 20 percent of all fatal crashes
involves drivers who were driving with an invalid (suspended,
revoked or canceled) license, who were unlicensed, or who were of
unknown license status.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 18 percent of the drivers in the "suspended
license" grouping had been convicted of drunk driving during the
three years prior to the fatal crashes.
</P>
<P>
A driver with a suspended or revoked license is 3.7 times more
likely than a driver with a valid license to be involved in a
fatal crash. Meanwhile, an unlicensed driver is 4.9 times more
likely than a driver with a valid license to be involved in a
fatal crash, the study said.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, New Mexico was the state with the
highest rate (23.7 percent) of improperly licensed drivers
involved in fatal crashes during the five-year study period,
followed closely by Washington D.C. (23 percent) and Arizona (23
percent).
</P>
<P>
The study, carried out by Lindsay Griffin and Sandra DeLaZerda
of Texas A&AMP;M University, indicated attempts to change human
behavior might not be the best solution for reducing unlawful
driving.
</P>
<P>
Instead, a better solution may be found in vehicle sanctions or
modifications that physically impede unlawful driving through
vehicle impoundment, electronic driving licenses or alcohol
ignition interlocks, which require the driver to provide a breath
sample every time he or she attempts to start the automobile, the
study said.

LOS ANGELES, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A report issued on Wednesday

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops Allegedly Discharge Toxic Chemicals Into S. Korean River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) has
discharged a large amount of toxic chemicals into the Han River
via drain pipes from its Yongsan headquarters camp in central
Seoul, said Green Korea United (GKU) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, the GKU accused the USFK of secretly
discharging some 480 bottles of solution mixed with formalin and
methanol into Han River which runs through the central part of the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
The GKU showed as evidence photos, empty bottles and remaining
solution.
</P>
<P>
Formalin and methanol are poisonous chemicals that can lead to
mental unrest and memory loss. Long-term exposure can kill fish
and other marine beings.
</P>
<P>
The USFK is said to have used the chemicals in preserving the
corpses of its servicemen who died from various accidents in South
Korea before repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The GKU said it will demonstrate in front of the USFK camp and
the U.S. embassy starting Friday to protest against such
irresponsible acts.
</P>
<P>
After the news conference, the South Korean Environment
Ministry asked the USFK to confirm the allegation.

<HEADLINE> Thorpe Says He Is Clean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian swimming teenage
sensation Thorpe said he would release the results of his next
drugs test to prove he is clean.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old world champion said he had asked the Australian
Sports Drug Agency to release his sample results.
</P>
<P>
Doping suspicions over Thorpe resurfaced after allegations by a
German swimmer, reported in a Sydney newspaper, that Thorpe's size
17 feet were the result of using human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
"Any suggestion that the size of Ian's feet are associated with
human growth hormone are absolutely ridiculous," his mother
Margaret Thorpe said.
</P>
<P>
"From a very, very young age, I couldn't find booties to fit
him. Big feet run in the family."
</P>
<P>
Thorpe's manager Dave Flaskas described the allegations "
ludicrous".
</P>
<P>
"He's totally discarded the accusation," Flaskas said. "He's at
training this morning, the whole thing's quite ludicrous. He might
have big feet, but the Germans have the big mouths."
</P>
<P>
"Every time they accuse him he goes quicker. The last time they
did that he broke a world record by one and a half seconds," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Asian Elephant Fossils Found in Good Shape in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered well-preserved fossils of the Asian elephant dating
back about 50,000 years to 100,000 years in a mountain cave in
Pubei County of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists believe that the fossils were those of Asian
elephants that lived in the late period the Pleistocene.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the archaeological team said that the fossils of
the Asian elephant's skull, thighbones, ribs and part of its chine
were found in a mountain cave near Mocun Village, Pubei County.
</P>
<P>
A senior researcher with Guangxi Regional Museum of Natural
Sciences believes the findings are the most complete Asian
elephant fossils ever excavated in China.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists also unearthed the fossils of more than 30
kinds of mammals that lived at the same time with Asian elephants.
Experts held the animals belonged to the giant panda-stegodon type,
a typical animal group of the Pleistocene.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that the discovery is highly valuable for
studying the distribution and evolution of the animal groups in
south China since the Quarternary Period and for studying the
ecological environment at that time.
</P>
<P>
Local government departments have earmarked a special fund for
continuing the excavation and preservation of the fossils, sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Wild Animals Increasing Rapidly in Tarim River Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of wild animals has
grown rapidly in the Tarim River valley, northwest China, over the
past 20 years due to improved environment, said an engineer who
has been engaged in wild animal protection for decades.
</P>
<P>
Gu Zhengqin said that surveys in recent years indicate that the
number of wild animals can match that of the domestic animals,
mainly horse, cattle and sheep, in some places in the river valley.
</P>
<P>
In some grassland areas, he added, if there are seven domestic
animals, you are likely to find five wild animals.
</P>
<P>
Gu said he once saw a herd of more than 4,000 wild Mongolian
gazelles and a flock of about 3,000 vultures during his out-door
investigation. Every year, 5,000 to 7,000 swans are seen in the
grassland in the river valley.
</P>
<P>
The 1,321-kilometer-long Tarim River in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region is the longest inland river in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 100 species of wild animals and
over 500 kinds of birds once lived in the Tarim River valley.
</P>
<P>
However, due to excessive poaching and lumbering in the 1960s-
1980s in the river valley, the number of wild animals dropped
drastically. Some species have even become extinct forever, such
as the Xinjiang tiger which can only been seen in history books
and the journals of some Western explorers.
</P>
<P>
Today, the rapid increase in the number of wild animals has
aroused interest among foreign experts. Some have come from Sweden
and Japan to investigate the wild animals sources. A Japanese
professor plans to provide fund to build a large wild animals
museum in the region.

<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China's central government has
approved the plan of setting up a satellite telecommunication
operator -- ChinaSat to further break up the market monopoly of
the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Ministry of Information Industry (MII) Cheng
Guanghui told a press conference here this morning that the
creating plan of ChinaSat has been approved by the State Council.
</P>
<P>

Telecom has been divided to two parts: China Telecom and China
Mobile.
</P>
<P>
Other major competitors include China Unicom, China Netcom, and
China Jitong.
</P>
<P>

their daily operation, the government tightened control of
industrial standards.
</P>
<P>
"The Telecommunications Administration Regulations is now under
the examination and to be approved by the State Council," Cheng
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has exerted efforts to improve market
access and standards of its telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we have worked hard to formulate the information
laws and regulations so as to meet the challenges brought by China
's accession into the World Trade Organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The efforts also include revising the tariff regulations,
according to Cheng.
</P>
<P>
MII is now working with taxation authorities to draft
implementation rules of tax incentives for computer software and
integrated circuit companies and is also drafting a catalogue of
duty-free integrated circuit goods by consulting with foreign
trade and customs authorities.
</P>
<P>

<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has been on a
track of steady growth in the first half of this year, said an
official with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate is 8.2 percent from January to June, according
to Qiu Xiaohua, deputy director of the NBS. Details are expected
to be officially released next week.
</P>
<P>
Qiu predicted that China's decrease in economic growth rate
caused partly by the Asian financial crisis will come to an end
within this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Qiu, demands of investment, consumption and export
have increased by 11, 10.1 and 38.3 percent respectively, thanks
to the continuous development of the industrial and service
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"If China had not adopted the positive fiscal policy, the
growth rate would have been 5 or 6 percent at most," said Qiu,
adding that the international economic environment has also been
favorable for China to boost export and attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Restoring confidence of consumers and producers and tapping new
sectors of development such as the "Western campaign" and efforts
for entry into the World Trade Organization have also contributed
to the growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Qiu warned that the current growth rate only indicates
a good starting point, and more work is yet to be done to secure a
stable growth trend.

TEHRAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Thursday expressed satisfaction with his three-day visit to
Germany, hopeful that good Tehran-Berlin ties will have a favorable
impact on Iran's ties with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his return from Germany, Khatami said
his talks with German President Johnannes Rau and Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder as well as other senior German officials have
been positive and good.
</P>
<P>
He added Tehran and Berlin are determined to expand relations in
all spheres, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Germany, he said, is interested in playing a greater role in the
world political scene, which is befitting for Germany's economic,
technical and scientific status. Relations with Iran, which enjoys
an excellent geopolitical position, are important for the country,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out, however, that the satisfactory visit
does not mean there is no difference between Iran and Germany. He
said only through talks can these misunderstandings be partly
removed.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed hope that his visit will serve as a prelude to
good and decisive ties between Iran and Germany and will be
beneficial for peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The German visit was the first by an Iranian president since the
1979 Islamic revolution.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Return Picasso Paintings to Owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Culture Minister Istemihan
Talay has promised to return two smuggled Picasso oil paintings to
their real owners, reported Turkish Daily News on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two paintings "La Fermiere" and "Dora Maar" were seized by
police in Izmir, southwest of Turkey, in two separate operations
while smugglers were trying to sell them, by chance, to undercover
police last month.
</P>
<P>
Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), a Spanish painter, moved to settle
down in Paris in 1904 and later became a pioneer painter of French
modernist school.
</P>
<P>
Talay told reporters in Izmir Wednesday the two paintings are
now kept in Ankara's State Painting and Sculpture Museum.
</P>
<P>
"Some countries are claiming to be the owner of these paintings
and have applied to the Foreign Ministry asking for return of the
works," he said. "Turkey will carefully examine these international
claims and if these countries can prove ownership according to the
international criteria, these paintings will be returned to them."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Manufacturing Sector Increasing IT Usage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The usage of information
technology (IT) in terms of the extent and intensity among
Malaysia's manufacturing industries showed an improvement over the
last two years, according to a Productivity Report 1999 released
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report released by the National Productivity Corporation
said IT was widely used for administrative functions and the
majority of the companies are using IT intensely to support such
functions.
</P>
<P>
All sub-sectors of the manufacturing sector recorded strong
growth, achieving more than 90 percent in IT usage for
administrative functions.
</P>
<P>
To encourage further growth in the manufacturing sector, the
government has initiated a Worldwide Manufacturing Web to provide
a conducive environment for value-added manufacturing using IT.
</P>
<P>
With the web, the government is enhancing the potential of
manufacturing companies to use advanced IT in their activities,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing companies should take heed of the government's
move to consider IT strategically and improve on existing
capabilities towards greater efficiency and competitiveness," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, the most important sector in the
economy with its contribution to the gross domestic product
amounting to more than one third, is expected to register a
productivity growth of 4.4 percent, employment growth of 3.5
percent and output growth of eight percent this year.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Opposes Nuclear Fuel Shipments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Trade Phil Goff said here Thursday that his country
remains firmly opposed to all shipments through its Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) of nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to reports that Britain and Japan had reached
an agreement on the fate of a mixed oxide fuel shipment that Japan
had rejected on arrival last year. It is understood that Britain
will now accept the return of the fuel.
</P>
<P>
In a government press release, Goff said his government has
made it clear to both Japan and Britain that New Zealand is
opposed to all such shipments and wants them to stay away from the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We accept that the risk of an accident is low, but the
consequences of an accident would be immense," the minister said.
"If there must be shipments, we expect prior warning. We expect
that the shipment should remain outside our EEZ."
</P>
<P>
The transport of such a hazardous substance raises the risk to
New Zealand, Goff said, stressing: "We believe that the transport
states should accept liability and responsibility to pay
compensation for any accidents."

<P>
BANGKOK, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia have reached an agreement on rubber trade
to prop up rubber prices and eliminate price-cutting among the
world's three largest rubber producers, the Thai News Agency (TNA)
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Arkom
Engchuan was quoted as saying that the agreement was reached at a
recent meeting between officials of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the three countries would use central prices,
which will be jointly set up based on an agreed currency, for
exports of their rubber products and would not sell their products
at prices lower than the jointly set-up levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
They would also cooperate in exchange of information on rubber
trade, stock control, and the opening up of rubber markets, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the three countries will meet in Malaysia
next month to discuss and set up the central prices to be
presented before the upcoming ministerial meeting of the three
countries, which will be held in Thailand's southern city of
Phuket in September, Arkom added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Firms Study More on Competitors Than on Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Organizations in Malaysia are
placing more emphasis on research on their competitors instead of
customers or suppliers, according to the National Productivity
Corporation (NPC) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NPC said in its Productivity Report 1999 that about 20.5
percent of the organizations surveyed indicated that they carried
out research on their competitors while only 16.3 percent carried
out research on customer preference and evaluating suppliers
electronically.
</P>
<P>
The findings came from a survey on "Electronic Commerce
Applications in Malaysia 1999" carried out by the NPC in
collaboration with Universiti (University) Malaya to explore the
extent of usage and implementation of e-commerce in various
sectors of the Malaysian economy.
</P>
<P>
The survey focused on trends of e-commerce applications in
marketing, advertising, customer support service, delivery and
payment.
</P>
<P>
The survey comprised 590 respondents, of which 12 percent
represented the trade sector, 8.6 percent finance and 7.5 percent
electrical &AMP; electronics.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that organizations were keen to use e-
commerce to provide better services to their customers, thus
improving the relationship between them, which was important for
business, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OAU Leaders Poised to Face Challenge  by Liu Hao and Zhang Dacheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The first annual summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) in the new millennium with the
theme of integration has paved the way for Africa to confront the
great challenges of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day summit which ended on Wednesday in the
Togolese capital, over 30 heads of state or government, together
with representatives of member states, discussed issues ranging
from AIDS, debt, refugees to poverty which have long plagued
Africa.
</P>
<P>
They seemed to run with time by reaching consensus on the draft
treaty of African Union at the last minute as they agreed that
there is no way but a closer union that can save Africa from being
marginalized by the globalization trend, though there was serious
debate over the speed, the nature and form of the Union.
</P>
<P>
At the closing ceremony, 25 member states inked signature on
the Draft Constitutive Act of the Union which will replace the OAU.
However, the act shall not come into force until two-thirds of the
OAU's 53 members ratified it.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the act signaled another decisive step to
accelerate integration process after the special summit in Sirte,
Libya, last September, which decided to create an African Union.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Union will be established at a special
summit in Sirte next March at the earliest date.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders believed that peace and security should be
the foundation on which the African Union was to be built.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that persistence of conflicts and wars is seriously
undermining the security and stability, and gravely hampering the
development efforts, they reaffirm their strong resolve to make
the year 2000 a year of peace, security and solidarity in Africa
in accordance with the Algiers Declaration at last summit in July
1999.
</P>
<P>
They were committed to intensify actions for peace and to
support efforts aimed at the peaceful settlement of conflicts in
Africa, particularly through the strengthening of the OAU
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they urged the U.N. and international
community to pay necessary attention to the management and
resolution of conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
With recurrent conflicts, widespread poverty, heavy external
debt burdens and the largest number of refugees and people
infected with HIV in the world, Africa is rightly expecting more
assistance from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the African leaders are aware that whatever the
help is given, their own responsibility is more important and it
is high time that Africans assume it so that peace and stability
prevail in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji's Europe Tour Fruitful: Chinese FM (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tang said that Zhu's visit to the six European countries and
the EU executive Commission promoted mutual understanding and
expanded common ground.
</P>
<P>
It was only normal for China and those European countries to
have different views on human rights, since they have different
histories, cultures, values and political systems with their
economic development at different stages, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Zhu discussed these differences with leaders
of the European countries and the EU commission. But in contrast
with the past, this time those countries affirmed China's great
progress in human rights and stressed their willingness to hold
further dialogues with China on the issue, the Chinese foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said
differences between countries should be respected and that he
opposed teaching other countries lessons on the human rights issue.
The Netherlands expressed its willingness to cooperate with China
on training juridical professionals, while Italy said different
political systems should not affect normal bilateral ties and
normal contacts.
</P>
<P>
China signed an agreement with Germany on judicial cooperation
and exchange. The EU said it will seek more fruitful dialogues
with China on the human rights issue, based on the nine dialogues
on the topic and four seminars on justice already held.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier's official visit also deepened Sino-EU
relations, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 will see the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of official relationship between China and the EU.
Under the circumstances of multipolarization and economic
globalization, the EU has taken China as the key factor in its
Asia policy while readjusting its internal and external policies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Developing Sino-European ties is a major part of China's
foreign policy because the EU is an important player in the
international arena, he said.
</P>
<P>
To have a closer Sino-EU ties are the common aspiration of the
two sides and are in the interests of both China and the EU, he
added.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Zhu exchanged views with EU leaders on the
further development of Sino-European relations and achieved
important common ground in terms of deepening mutual and equal
cooperation in all fields, according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
Tang added that there are no direct conflicts of interest
between China and the European countries, and that the two sides
hold identical or similar positions on many international issues.
</P>
<P>
China and Europe, both are exerting ever greater influence in
world affairs, prefer multipolarization to unipolarization, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Chinese delegation's successful visit to the
six European countries and the EU headquarters will definitely
push China's relations with these countries and the EU to a new,
higher level," Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji's Europe Tour Fruitful: Chinese FM (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
successful Europe tour has achieved the aim of deepening mutual
understanding, enhancing friendship and cooperation, and promoting
the development of Sino-European ties, Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who accompanied Zhu on the tour, described as a vital
Chinese diplomatic move in Europe the premier's six-nation tour,
which took him to Bulgaria, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Italy, Belgium and the European Union (EU) headquarters from June
27 to July 12.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Zhu held talks with leaders of the six
nations and the EU on a wide range of issues, including
differences, Tang told reporters.
</P>
<P>
They achieved common understanding on many major international
issues, including the U.S. National Missile Defense (NMD) program
and the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) program, developments in
Asia and Europe, and the reform of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu had extensive contacts with local industrial, business and
financial communities and delivered speeches on China's economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 cooperation accords were signed with the six
nations in the fields of economy, culture and legislation.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the tour as "fruitful," Tang said that it would further
consolidate and bolster bilateral political relations between
China and the six nations and the 15-nation EU.
</P>
<P>
Zhu emphasized that China adopts a positive approach in
developing bilateral relations with all these countries and that
it is willing to increase bilateral political dialogue and
consultations at all levels on the basis of mutual respect,
equality, mutually benefiting and seeking common ground while
reserving differences, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, Zhu said that China respects the Bulgarian
people's choice of their development path, and attaches great
importance to developing the traditional friendship between the
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
During his visits to the five EU member states and the EU
headquarters, Zhu expressed China's support for the ongoing
integration process in Europe, and called on the EU to further
play its active role in the establishment of a just, reasonable
international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhu elaborated on China's basic stance of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems" on resolving the
Taiwan issue. He expressed appreciation to those countries who
have kept their promises on the Taiwan issue while criticizing the
conducts of breaking promises on the issue.
</P>
<P>
All the six nations and the EU expressed their firm support for
China's early entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), and
reiterated that they will continue to pursue the one China policy
while refraining from developing official ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Zhu's visit further promoted the economic and trade
relations between China and those countries, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu briefed the hosts on China's economic situation and
development prospects. He said China's economy is experiencing an
upturn after getting rid of the negative impact brought about by
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a rather long period of time to come, China will maintain a
rapid, sound and sustainable economic growth, make bigger strides
in restructuring its economy, reforming the economic system and
effectively implementing the opening-up policy in a broader range,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China's strategy to develop its western region will inject new
vitality into its economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
With China's entry into the WTO and the deepening of its
opening-up policy, the country will further open its market,
improve its laws and regulations and optimize the investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
In response, leaders of the six European countries and the EU
and the business circles all expressed their strong desire to
expand economic, trade and financial cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian leaders reaffirmed that the country is working to
promote its relations with China, especially hoping to develop
bilateral economic, trade and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs from western European states indicated that they
are willing to involve themselves in developing China's western
region and have put forth many ambitious investment plans. At the
same time, medium- and small-sized enterprises have shown great
interest in entering the Chinese market, hoping to get support
from both the Chinese and their own governments.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Foreign Ministers Meeting Ends With Pledge to Prevent Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the Group of
Eight (G-8) nations Thursday concluded their two-day meeting in
Miyazaki, southwestern Japan, after issuing a joint statement and
a comprehensive action plan on conflict prevention.
</P>
<P>
The statement underlined G-8 commitments to deal with regional
issues in Asia, disarmament and nonproliferation, U.N. reforms,
fight against international organized crime and terrorism and
environment problems.
</P>
<P>
The action plan, called the "Miyazaki Initiative," focused on
five conflict-prevention measures, including controlling small
arms and illegal diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
The two documents will serve as a blueprint for political and
security talks at the July 21-23 summit in Okinawa Prefecture that
brings together the G-8 leaders from Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The action plan commits the G-8 ministers to comprehensively
dealing with a "full spectrum" of political, economic and social
problems in states or areas vulnerable to conflict, currently in
crisis, or coping with the aftermath of strife.
</P>
<P>
The plan features five key measures, tightening controls on the
diamond trade to stem arms purchases in such war-torn African
countries as Sierra Leone, pressing countries to stop recruiting
children as soldiers, strengthening regulations on exports of
small firearms to strife-torn areas, promoting the eradication of
poverty, and helping nations establish and train civilian police.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to set up a high-level working group to
formulate and follow up on measures to prevent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is the G-8's first comprehensive conflict-
prevention package.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, who chaired the meeting,
demonstrated Japan's leading role in the initiative at the first-
day session by announcing that Japan will actively use its
official development assistance to support conflict prevention and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working for the cause, a
Japanese official said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright skipped the meeting
to focus on the U.S.-hosted Middle East peace summit that opened
Tuesday in Camp David, Maryland. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott attended the meeting in Albright's place.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers from the other G-8 countries took part in
the annual pre-summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
On regional issues, they welcomed the first-ever inter-Korea
dialogue held last month in Pyongyang and expressed hope it will
lead to "easing tension in the region."
</P>
<P>
The statement underscored G-8 support for reform efforts in
Indonesia, citing the importance of its "territorial integrity" in
alluding to a spate of separatist activities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
On East Timor, which has won independence from Indonesia, the
ministers reaffirmed their commitments to helping its
reconstruction and nation-building efforts.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not include a Russian-proposed expression of
concern over a U.S. plan to build a national missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
But it contains commitments from Moscow and Washington to
quickly implement the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (
START II) and conclude START III.
</P>
<P>
The ministers pledged to promote the implementation of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons and the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The statement calls for maximizing efforts to realize U.N.
reforms, including an overhaul of the Security Council, saying the
U.N. Millennium Summit slated for early September should be a key
venue for members of the world body to discuss reform.
</P>
<P>
Other regional issues covered in the statement include Sri
Lanka, Iran, Iraq, Peru, Afghanistan, Cyprus, Balkan stability,
African conflicts and Colombia.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have designed
a compound vaccine after four years of tests on mice, rabbits and
monkeys, and found it is resistant to Hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
A thesis on the research was recently published in the country'
s leading scientific journal -- Chinese Science Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, from Fudan University, No.1 Medical College of
the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and a medical college in
southwest China's Yunnan Province, have used gene engineering
techniques in the development of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis has prevailed for a long time and spread widely in
the world, especially in developing countries in Asia, Africa and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
But researchers said they still have a long way to go before
the vaccine is applied to human beings.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Productivity Set to Grow by 4.2 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's productivity has
been forecast to grow by 4.2 percent this year from 3.9 percent
last year, the National Productivity Corporation (NPC) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 4.2 percent productivity growth this year against the
forecast year-on-year increase of three percent can be expected
amidst further growth resulting from strong economic fundamentals,
a conducive investment climate and sound macro-economic policies,
NPC said in its 1999 productivity report released here.
</P>
<P>
The productivity level increased to 22.026 billion ringgit (5.
79 billion U.S. dollars) last year against 21.207 billion ringgit
(5.58 billion dollars) in the previous year, it said.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve higher productivity growth, emphasis will have to
be placed on enhancing Total Productivity Factor (TFP) and
application of appropriate technology in both the private and
public sectors," the corporation said, adding in this respect, the
Knowledge Economy (K-economy) could be the most appropriate
strategy to enhance productivity.
</P>
<P>
This strategy could be expected to generate added value per
unit of factor of production and hence lead to a higher
productivity, it said.
</P>
<P>
The most important sector, manufacturing, is expected to
register a productivity growth of 4.4 percent, employment 3.5
percent and output eight percent. The sector's performance is
expected to be stimulated by greater demand, domestically and in
the global market.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector is expected to post a productivity
growth of 3.7 percent, employment 1.3 percent, output 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The finance sector is expected to record a productivity growth
of 4.4 percent, employment 1.0, and output 5.4 percent, while the
trade sector is expected to register a productivity growth of 1.7
percent, employment 2.8, and output 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, productivity contributed 70 percent, while
employment contributed 29.0 percent to the annual Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth of 5.6 percent, the NPC said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's productivity last year outstripped that of several
selected major Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) countries where Japan saw a 2.3 percent growth,
the United States 2.3 percent, and Germany 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that to improve productivity growth and competitiveness,
small and medium-sized industries need to further increase their
added value generation through adoption of higher technologies and
venturing into high value-added products.

HARARE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's army and police will not
withdraw their units from identified "flash points" in Harare
despite widespread condemnation of perceived strong-arm tactics by
the troops, The Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police Spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena
Wednesday said in a statement that the public's claims of army
brutality had not been substantiated.
</P>
<P>
He said as far as he knew the officers deployed to the suburbs
were under instructions not to harass anyone but to suppress
lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers have been accused of imposing "marshal law" over wide
swatches of Harare and other parts of the country, beating up
revelers at beer halls and people found in groups, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Bvudzijena said that police were sure that calling off the
operation would result in a resurgence of post-election political
violence.
</P>
<P>
About 30 people were arrested in the recent days after sporadic
incidents in suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Reports Profit Increase for 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Motorola Inc., the world's
second-largest supplier of wireless phones, Wednesday reported a
second-quarter operating profit that nearly doubled from the same
period last year amid stronger sales in broadband communications
and network systems.
</P>
<P>
Motorola said it earned 515 million U.S. dollars from ongoing
operations, or 23 cents per share in the quarter, excluding
special items, up 91 percent from 269 million dollars, or a split-
adjusted 13 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Second-quarter 2000 revenues climbed to 9.3 billion dollars
from 7.6 billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In Motorola's widely watched personal communications segment,
which includes wireless phones, sales rose 20 percent to 3.3
billion dollars and orders declined less than 1 percent to 3.1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in profitability in the second quarter versus
the first quarter was driven by better gross margins from phone
products and better overall conversion costs in manufacturing, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
In the network systems segment, sales increased 23 percent to 2.
0 billion dollars and orders were up 37 percent to 2.1 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Broadband communications unit sales increased 23 percent to 768
million dollars and orders increased 28 percent to 900 million
dollars from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In semiconductor products, sales increased 27 percent to 2.0
billion dollars and orders rose 31 percent to 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Overall company results continue to show solid improvement in
sales and profits," Robert L. Growney, Motorola's president and
chief operating officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We are particularly pleased by the performance of the
Broadband Communications and Network Systems segments," he said.

<HEADLINE> Weakening Baht Helps Thailand's Recovery by Boosting Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The recent weakening of the Thai
baht will help support Thailand's economic recovery, given that
exports remained the country's main engine for growth, Bank of
Thailand's governor Chatumongol Sonakul was quoted Thursday by
Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the baht dipped as low as 40.16 to the U.S.
dollar, its weakest level for at least nine months. But
Chatumongol said the baht remained within "optimal" levels, and
said the central bank had no plans to intervene in the market.
</P>
<P>
"The baht has moved along with the currencies of our 22 main
trading partners, although some competitors, like the Philippines
and Indonesia, have seen greater weakness," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The baht's current value would boost Thailand's export
competitiveness, with exports remaining the only sector with
strong performance, as government spending and investment had
remained flat, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We see no necessity to intervene in the current situation,"
Chatumongol remarked.
</P>
<P>
He said even the baht dipping as low as 42 to the dollar and
oil prices of 30 dollars per barrel would remain acceptable.
</P>
<P>
"We have run economic models under that scenario and the
results came out that it is fairly acceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to say specifically at which point intervention
would be considered.
</P>
<P>
The weaker baht would have no impact on the country's debt
servicing ability, given existing current account surpluses and
foreign direct investment levels, according to him.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts said the economy remained fragile, given
recent revisions of total foreign debt upwards by 20 billion
dollars to 92 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The baht on Wednesday traded at 40.045/40.125 to the dollar,
gaining some ground after dropping as low as 40.165 before noon
and 39.955 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking by offshore players helped the baht's rebound in
the afternoon trading, dealers said, with short-term technical
targets now set at around 40.25/40.30 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Interbank rates have also shown increased volatility in the
past few days, with overnight rates quoted at 2.5-3 percent
Wednesday from 2 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said it was unlikely that the baht would break
41 to the dollar, and expected that the recent volatility will
ease in the next two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
With Thai export performance being still strong, fundamental
factors would support the baht against further declines, they said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Top Political Leaders' Scheduled Meeting Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The planned meeting of Indonesia's
four most influential political figures on Wednesday was delayed
for an indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the cancellation of the meeting, President
Abdurrahman Wahid said that he and Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputri, People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) Chairman Amien
Rais and House of Representatives (DPR) Speaker Akbar Tandjung
canceled the meeting due to different agendas and political
interests.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult for us to be together because each of us
has a different purpose, therefore I chose to stay here a little
bit longer," the president was quoted Thursday by the Indonesian
Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president did not say if it would be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's close confidant and Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said
the informal meeting was postponed after Rais opted out due to a
reported illness.
</P>
<P>
Akbar was originally named the host of Wednesday's event, the
follow-up to a previous meeting between Wahid, Akbar and Rais at
the Crown Plaza Hotel last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Observer speculated that the four top political
figures would meet soon in a bid to quell mounting political
bickering ahead of a key MPR session next month that has pummeled
the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah hit a 21-month low, closing at 9,415/9,425 per U.S.
dollar on Wednesday. The Indonesian currency has fallen 25 percent
so far this year on political and security concerns.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the benchmark one-month Bank Indonesia
certificates rate rose to 13.11 percent Wednesday from 12.69
percent last week.

COLOMBO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka recorded a 21 percent
growth in exports during the first quarter of this year with

</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate was significant during the initial years
of 1995 to 1997 which recorded a 18.23 percent growth in dollar
term. But from 1998 onwards due to the East Asian financial crisis,
the Russian Rouble crisis and other factors, Sri Lanka's export
growth rates have been lowered, Hewawasam said.
</P>
<P>
A market development scheme was adopted by the government for
the entire export sector with single country exhibitions, special
product trade fairs, multi-product exhibitions and sales missions
in both established and emerging markets in western countries like
Japan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Significant achievements in the export sector is that between
1994 and 1999 textiles and garments increased from 1.55 billion
dollars in 1994 to 3.42 billion dollars in 1999 and industrial
exports went up from 2.47 billion dollars in 1994 to 3.51 billion

BANGKOK, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will not provide
political asylum for the 17 Laotians who fled into the country
after they raided a Lao border checkpoint on July 3, a senior
official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It would be unreasonable for authorities to consider giving
political asylum to those Laotians who committed crimes," National
Security Council Secretary-General Kachadpai Burusapatana was
quoted by a government source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The group of rebels would be handed back to Laos after they
were tried in Thailand for illegal entry and possession of illegal
weapons, according to him.
</P>
<P>
The 17 Lao were among a group who clashed with Lao government
forces at the Vang Tao border checkpoint on July 3 and fled across
the Thai-Lao border with 11 Thais.
</P>
<P>
The 28 men were detained by Thai authorities in the Ubon
Rachathani Province, 695 kilometers northeast of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The Lao government has formally demanded the extradition of all
28 people but the Thai authorities said the 11 Thais will not be
handed over.

<HEADLINE> Status quo Forces in Indonesia Exploit Press Freedom: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid has accused the forces loyal to former President Soeharto of
exploiting press freedom to fight against political reforms in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The status quo forces are fighting against political reform
through the media that they control, the Jakarta Post daily
Thursday quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Wahid ruled out controlling the press the way Soeharto
often did.
</P>
<P>
"Parties defending the (Political) status quo are using every
means to prevent change. They do this by buying up shares and
taking control of media institutions," Wahid said Wednesday here
at a seminar on the ethics of journalism.
</P>
<P>
Although falling short of naming the parties or the media, he
said the media involved are distorting facts, concealing positive
achievements and giving undue attention to the negative aspects of
his administration. "They make it look like my administration is
about to fall apart," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that all the five commercial TV stations are owned
or partly owned by children and cronies of Soeharto. They also
control some newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also criticized the press in general for their failure to
uphold the foremost principle in the journalist' code of ethics,
namely accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed the need for the media to adhere to
their code of ethics and conduct as they enjoy the freedom now
guaranteed by law.

<HEADLINE> Ottey Returns to Race after Doping Ban Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Jamican sprinter Merleno Ottey won
the women's 100-meters in a regional track in Nuoro of Italy on
Wednesday, only nine days after being cleared of accusations that
she used steroids.
</P>
<P>
"It felt good to get started again," the 40-year-old five-time
Olympian said after the race."My goal now is to get to Sydney and
reach 20 years of Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Ottey, a double silver medalist at the 1996 Games, said the
doping ban that had kept her out of international competition for
12 months was ``like being sentenced to life in prison for
something you didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
Track and field's world governing body, the IAAF, reinstated
Ottey last Monday after concluding that a Swiss lab had improperly
tested her urine sample when she came up positive for the steroid
nandrolone at a meet in Switzerland in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Her next competition will be the Jamaican national championship,
July 20-22 where she will run the 100 and 200 meters, seeking to
qualify for her sixth Olympic Games. Ottey has won 34 individual
medals in major international championships and is a former world
200-meter champion.
</P>
<P>
In its decision to reinstate the sprinter, the IAAF said its
arbitration panel found fault with the Swiss laboratory, saying it`
`had not taken into sufficient account factors regarding the
specific gravity of the sample which as a result did not exceed
the IOC (International Olympic Committee) recommended reporting
threshold.''
</P>
<P>
Nandrolone is a steroid that is easily detectable in standard
drug tests. However, there have been a spate of positive
nandrolone cases around the world over the past year, prompting
speculation that the drug is contained in nutritional supplements.

<TEXT>
<P>
He said that security personnel while searching the three
vessels found 600 home-made firearms, 232 home-made bombs, 290
sharp weapons, 14 molotov cocktails, 11 detonators and 2,127 bows.
</P>
<P>
"All these weapons and the three boats are now confiscated and
kept at the naval base in Maluku, while the 475 persons on board
the ships were later released," Soedarsono was quoted by the
Antara News Agency Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Eastern Fleet's patrols intercepted and held 17
motor boats and thousands of various standard and home-made
weapons and firearms from July 2 to 10.
</P>
<P>
The Navy launched regular patrols in the Maluku waters to back
the civil emergency status which was enacted in Maluku and North
Maluku provinces on June 27.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Indonesian Military (TNI) Commander Adm. Widodo A.S.
said the security situation in Maluku has been improved since the
civil emergency was declared. However, to maintain order there,
the TNI will dispatch two battalions of reinforcement troops.
</P>
<P>
Widodo said security authorities have seized thousands of
weapons and explosives in a series of arms sweeping operations in
Maluku. He said he expected to see the operation to disarm the
disputed parties net more weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the civil emergency ruler in Maluku Saleh
Latuconsina complained about the lack of authority he holds in
restoring order.
</P>
<P>
"Although I'm the civil emergency ruler, I cannot give orders
but only ask for immediate security measures," Latuconsina, who is
Maluku governor, was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Violence has been rife in the Maluku capital of Ambon since the
enactment of the civil emergency in the province. One of the worst
incidences was the predawn attack which totally destroyed the 30-
hectare compound of the state Pattimura University and three
neighboring villages on July 4.
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday night, gunfire and explosions were still heard
coming from some areas in Ambon. School and business activities

JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The official number of HIV/AIDS
cases in Indonesia now stands at 1,283, although health experts
predicted the real figure could be as high as 350,000 or more, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the latest official report from the Health
Ministry dated June 30, 2000, there are 1,283 HIV/AIDS cases,
consisting of 331 AIDS patients and 952 HIV-positive patients,
based on a very limited number of blood tests," the Indonesian
Observer daily Thursday quoted Coordinating Minister for People's
Welfare and Poverty Eradication Basri Hasanuddin as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the HIV/AIDS cases recorded in the country
were transmitted through heterosexual contact.
</P>
<P>
Eight of cases involved mothers passing the incurable disease
on to their offspring, he said, adding several cases were also
caused by intravenous drug users sharing unclean needles.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't break our silence in this time of dire need, a
disaster may soon engulf our people," Hasanuddin added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an official of the Health Ministry said that the
number of those infected with HIV has shown an alarming increase
in Indonesia this year, with the total number of new sufferers in
the first five months of 2000 nearly being equal to last year's 12-
month total.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Romania, as a sovereign state,
should remain neutral, said visiting Chairman of the State Duma of
Russia Gennady Seleznev at a press conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is unnecessary for Romania to join an alliance, because it
does not face any threat, the Romanian Press quoted Seleznev, the
Russian parliament speaker, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly opposes any move to expand the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), said Seleznev, emphasizing that NATO,
as a military bloc, should have been disbanded as the Warsaw
Treaty Organization did in July 1991.
</P>
<P>
Romania has its own right to decide whether to join NATO or not.
But Russia "will certainly feel unhappy" when it is surrounded by
NATO troops, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The NATO bombing of Yugoslav in 1999 sets "a bad example" and
such bombing can solve no issues, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the pollution caused by the bombing, Seleznev said,
NATO alone should take the responsibility for the environmental
pollution and detriments to the health of the local people.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Rebels Delay Release of Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's coup leaders said they
were unlikely to release on Thursday the last 18 hostages they
were holding in parliament, the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC) reported.
</P>
<P>
Coup leader George Speight had agreed to release the hostages
on Thursday, as the Great Council of Chiefs met to select a new
president and vice president for the country.
</P>
<P>
But rebel spokesman Joe Nata said the release was unlikely to
go ahead Thursday because the martial law authorities, which had
negotiated an end to the crisis with Speight, have not gazetted
the necessary decrees, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
"This will torpedo the whole process," Nata said.
</P>
<P>
Under an accord between Speight and the military, which
declared martial law on May 29, the 50-strong Great Council of
Chiefs was to meet on Thursday to name a new president and vice
president.
</P>
<P>
In return, Speight was committed to releasing all the hostages,
including Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
But Nata said that would probably be put off.
</P>
<P>
Of the original 31 people taken hostage eight weeks ago, 13
have been set free.
</P>
<P>
The ABC quoted Radio Fiji as saying candidates the 50 chiefs
will consider include the previous president, Ratu Sir Kamisese
Mara, the council's chairman, Sitiveni Rabuka, and the previous

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2,000 houses were destroyed
in Wednesday's earthquake measuring 5.1 on the Richter Scale which
shook West Java, Indonesia, according to national newspapers
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No fatalities were reported, but around 30 employees of the PT
Honey Lady factory in Bogor, situated around 60 kilometers south
of Jakarta, were injured when 2,500 workers, mostly women,
panicked and tried to flee the factory.
</P>
<P>
In Cibadak village near Sukabumi, some 100 kilometers south of
Jakarta, at least 35 workers were being treated for shock.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday night, nearly 5,000 people were seeking temporary
refuge at their neighbors' and relatives' houses as well as
mosques.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the tectonic quake which lasted some 20
seconds was in the area of Sukabumi. The quake was also felt by
residents as far away as in Jakarta, Bogor and Bandung, capital of
West Java, but with less intensity.
</P>
<P>
In Bandung, people rushed out of their houses and offices as
soon as they felt the quake at 08:10 a.m. local time (01:10 GMT).
Many shops turned on their alarms ordering people to leave the
buildings. Three buildings in the city were slightly damaged by
the tremor.
</P>
<P>
The quake did not disrupt the activities of people in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The head of the seismotectonic division at the geological
research and development center in Bandung Engkon K. Kertapati
said at least nine quakes hit Sukabumi this month and Wednesday's
tremor was the strongest.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's quake came only a month after a strong 7.3
magnitude quake shook Bengkulu in West Sumatra, killing 130 people
and leaving thousands homeless.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
reduced its debt to the United Nations by some 135 million U.S.
dollars, but still owes more than 1.5 billion dollars, a U.N.
spokeswoman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 135-million-dollar payment went to reduce arrears to a
number of U.N. peacekeeping operations, 30 percent of whose costs
are assessed against the United States according to the
universally accepted principle of "the capacity to pay."
</P>
<P>
But Washington still owes some 1.16 billion dollars for
peacekeeping and about 460 million in arrears to the regular
budget, for which the U.S. assessment is 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States is often under fire at the United Nations
for its reluctance to pay its back dues full, on time and without
conditions. However, Washington is seeking a review by the General
Assembly of the scale of assessment.

<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Trademark Administration
has overruled an appeal by the Shell Oil company of the United
States against a Chinese company which was alleged to have
violated Shell's intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The name "Shell" is the trademark of a drink developed by the
Ningbo Native And Live Stock Products Company in east China's
Zhejiang province in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the U.S. Shell company delivered a paper of objection
to China's State Trademark Administration (STA), demanding that
the use of the trademark by the Ningbo company be discontinued.
</P>
<P>
The Ningbo company claimed that it was innocent and delivered a
document to safeguard its rights.
</P>
<P>
The STA recently decided that the two "Shells" are engaged in
producing entirely different products and there is no infringement
of intellectual property rights in this case.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Shell is asking the international trademark jury to
make the final judgment.

XI'AN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province, an arid area in
northwest China, is expected to turn 60,000 hectares of dry land
into irrigated fields when a World Bank-funded project is
completed.
</P>

At present, construction of three pump stations, a 130-km-long
canal and a 5-km-long tunnel is winding up. During a recent test
operation, 1,066 ha of land were watered.
</P>
<P>
When fully operational in October, the irrigation project is to
bring adequate water to 60,000 ha of dry land and provide clean

<HEADLINE> Archeological Survey Tells True Figures of Murals Plundered by Foreign Explorers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A recent archeological survey in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region showed that the
amount of murals plundered by foreign explorers at Kizil Thousand
Buddha Cave some 90 years ago was much more than the figure they
had announced before.
</P>
<P>
The One Thousand Buddha Cave, located in Baicheng County of
Aksu Prefecture, is the largest group of grottoes cut in the
ancient Guizi State of Western Regions with 236 caves. It is one
of the four famous grottoes in China together with grottoes at
Dunhuang in Gansu Province, Longmen in Henan Province and Yungang
in Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The German royal inspection team went to Kizil caves in 1906
and 1913 respectively and took many murals away. A report
published by Germany in 1933 say it had taken 252 pieces of murals
from 37 caves in Kizil with a total area of 328 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The one-year archeological survey proved that almost all the 60
caves found at that period were plundered by explorers from Russia,
Japan and Germany. A total of 480 square meters of murals were
taken away, most of which were stolen by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
Huo Xuchu, a researcher at the Guizi Grottoes Institute,
attributed the difference between the two figures to the amount of
murals damaged in the course of transportation to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Albert Grunwedel, head of the then German royal inspection team,
admitted that the Chinese murals are of great importance to the
study of the history of arts in central Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Once a complete set of murals is destroyed, it is impossible
for others to study the general picture of these murals," said
Huang Wenbi, a noted Chinese archeologist.
</P>
<P>
"Though the historical period that made us sad has elapsed, the
regret created by the history must be made up," Huo said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Referee Indicted for Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- NBA referee Ken Mauer was
charged on Wednesday with tax evasion, becoming the latest NBA
official implicated in an airline ticket scam.
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old referee was charged with tax evasion and
obstructing federal tax laws in Minneapolis as he received "
substantial taxable income" from 1989 through 1994 but failed to
declare it.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen other referees have faced similar charges. Like
them, Mauer is accused of being reimbursed for first-class airline
tickets after buying less-expensive tickets.
</P>
<P>
Under their union contract, referees were allowed to downgrade
their first-class tickets to coach and keep the difference as a
way of supplementing their incomes. But the Internal Revenue
Service required them to report the excess reimbursements as
income on their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 other NBA officials pleaded guilty earlier. Most
were fined a few thousand dollars, put on probation and ordered to
pay their back taxes. Some also had to serve short periods of home
detention.

Roed-Larsen said here Thursday that the U.N. will step up its
efforts to help achieve a peace in the region under the framework

</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference after a meeting with
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib over the latest
developments in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The envoy stressed that the U.N. will mainly work under the
framework of all U.N. resolutions on the Middle East, and help
parties concerned to find solutions to their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
On Lebanon, Larsen said the U.N. has provided help to the
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, and the U.N. hoped the
ongoing sporadic conflicts on the Israel-Lebanon border would cease
by the end of July after the two sides reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Cooperation Among Branches of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
has called on the country's different branches of power to stop
their tug-of-war and resume cooperation for the well-being of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
State authority is in short supply in Russia, so balance and
cooperation between the branches of authority must be urgently re-
instituted, Putin said in an interview to be published in the
Friday edition of the Izvestia newspaper, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin was apparently referring to the opposition in the
Federation Council to measures he proposed on the reorganization
of the upper house of parliament. The measures, already passed by
the State Duma lower house of parliament, remain stranded in the
council.
</P>
<P>
The bills on restructuring the authority "remain within the
logic of setting the rules because every state or municipal body
of authority must have clear-cut responsibilities as well as
rights," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The branches of authority must stop playing tug-of-war and
working on their own corporate or personal ambitions rather than
the interests of the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he wants to put an end to the situation in
which Russians seem to be subjects of different regions rather
than citizens of the same country.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Chile To Establish Bioceanic Corridors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian and Chilean
governments will examine the establishment of bioceanic corridors,
Chilean Foreign Minister Soledad Alvear said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bioceanic corridors would make up an eventual part of an accord
to be signed between the National Aeronautic Company of Chile (
Enaer) and Brazil's to Embraer, said the head of Chile's
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Alvear is accompanying President Ricardo Lagos, who arrived in
Brazil Wednesday for a tree-day visit.
</P>
<P>
One of the corridors would connect the Chilean ports of Arica
and Ireque, the Peruvian port of Ilo, and Santos in Brazil and
would include Tambo Quemado and Santa Cruz de la Sierra stretches
in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
Another corridor would lie between the Chilean port of
Antofagasta, and Resistencia and Santos in Brazil, and would
include Salta and Jujuy (Argentina).
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that though there's an aeronautic
accord, Enaer will make parts for tail ends of Brazilian military
and trade planes.
</P>

Lagos met this Thursday Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso at the Planalto Palace, where both leaders signed a joint
statement.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Vietnam Sign Historic Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Vietnam
on Thursday signed a historic trade agreement, President Bill
Clinton announced at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"From the bitter past, we plant the seeds of a better future,"
said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He described the agreement as "another historic step in the
process of normalization, reconciliation, healing between our two
nations."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the agreement signed by U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky and Vietnamese Trade Minister Vu Khoan would
drastically open Vietnam's economy and increase trade between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky and Khoan resumed trade talks last Thursday in a bid
to finalize a trade pact after four years of on-and-off
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the trade pact marked a major step toward
completing the normalization process which began on July 11, 1995,
when Clinton extended diplomatic ties to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The trade agreement must be approved by the U.S. Congress
before taking effect.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Vietnam would reduce its tariffs and
undertake a series of measures to open its markets to U.S. goods,
services and investment.
</P>
<P>
In return, Vietnam would get access to the U.S. market under
the same system of low tariffs accorded most nations.

<P>
ATHENS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government Thursday
decided to take drastic measures to combat the spate of forest
fires around the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after an emergency government meeting chaired by
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis Thursday, Greece's Interior
Minister Vasso Papandreou said that the measures included putting

capital city.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 11,500 hectares of forest and farm land have been

<HEADLINE> UK Car Prices Much More Expensive Than Europe's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The massive gap between new car
prices in Britain and those in Europe has widened, according to
figures compiled by the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The figures reveal that the price of the Vauxhall Astra is 65
percent higher in the UK than the cheapest EU country, while the
Renault Laguna is 60 percent more, a Citroen Xentia 41 percent
more and a three-series BMW 33 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge gulf in prices, the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the figures did not reflect
the fall in prices during the past six months.
</P>
<P>
It said that the reason for the growing gap was the 10 percent
fall in the value of the euro against the pound since November.
</P>
<P>
According to the SMMT, the value of the pound has risen by 44
percent since May 1996 and 10 percent in the six months since the
previous European price survey.
</P>
<P>
The figures come at a time when the UK motor industry is
reaching the end of a consultation period in which it has to
respond to government demands to implement a package of measures
designed to lower the price of new cars.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Pledges to Change Laws to Meet WTO Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has submitted a large
amount of documents at the working party on its accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and pledged to bring its laws into
conformity with WTO rules, trade sources said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Economy Andriy Gonchurak made a statement in
which he described the new stage of economic reforms which began
after Kuchma was re-elected president in November 1999 and took
further shape in the "Reforms for Wellbeing" approved by the
Verkhovna Rada in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Privatization of large-scale industries, profound market
reform in the control over the economy, liberalization of markets
of trade in goods and services are among key components of the
program," Gonchurak said.
</P>
<P>
He listed statistics from the first five months of 2000 showing
how the Ukrainian economy is improving. He said, "For the first
time in the history of Ukraine's independence, a 5.4 percent
growth in GDP was reached."
</P>
<P>
He added that "the most dynamic growth of production activity
is observed in industrial sectors oriented at the domestic market
and producing end-products."
</P>
<P>
Growth rates in these sectors include 31.4 percent for the
textiles industry, 31.9 percent for foodstuffs production, and 37.
3 percent for wood processing and pulp and paper.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has almost finished market access negotiations with
some members, but not the major players such as the U.S. and EU,
and more informal meetings are possible towards the end of the
year, but not necessarily the working party. The previous meeting
was in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Trade sources believe that a lot of work remains on Ukraine's
accession negotiation.

<HEADLINE> Canada's June Inflation Up but Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada's annual inflation rate was
up to 2.9 percent in June from 2.4 percent in May, largely as a
result of soaring gasoline prices, Statistics Canada reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the country's core inflation rate, which excludes energy
and food, remained steady at 1.4 percent, indicating that the Bank
of Canada is under no pressure to raise interest rates in the
short term and the Canadian dollar will remain stable.
</P>
<P>
"Core consumer prices remained well-behaved, with the year-over-
year rate of change staying below the Bank of Canada's one to
three percent target band," said Craig Alexander, a leading
economist of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, at the
release of the inflation report by Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
Among major inflation contributors, gasoline prices rose 6.3
percent from May to June, accounting for nearly half of the rise
in the overall price index.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage interest rates rose 0.7 percent on a month-to-month
basis, the highest jump since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hotels and Motels entered into summer rates by raising prices
by 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tuition fees, natural gas and fuel oil also cost more in June
while the effects were offset by flat or declining prices of autos,
clothing, fresh fruit, furniture and computers.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Closes World AIDS Conference with Call for Greater Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela on Friday closed the 13th International
AIDS Conference in Durban by calling on the international
community to rise above differences and combine efforts to fight
the scourge.
</P>
<P>
"We have to rise above our differences and combine our efforts
to save our people. History will judge us harshly if we fail to do
so now, and right now, " said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He noted that these people, who were most afflicted by the HIV/
AIDS scourge, would want their needs addressed with collective
action.
</P>
<P>
Mandela received a resounding welcome from AIDS experts and
international media alike when he arrived at the conference, which
was attended by 2,700 delegates from 200 nations and regions.
</P>
<P>
The retired president said that the only way to stem the tide
of the HIV pandemic was to adopt a multi-sectoral approach, adding
large-scale actions were needed to prevent mother-to-child
transmission.
</P>
<P>
Mandela encouraged the search for a vaccine, which is estimated
to need five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need for information programs to spread
awareness of the disease.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is to move from rhetoric to action, and action
at an unprecedented intensity and scale," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
The former president also rebuked those who criticized
President Thabo Mbeki or his support of "dissident" scientists who
challenged the traditional theory that HIV causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The president of this country is a man of great intellect who
takes scientific thinking very seriously and leads a government
that I know to be committed to those principles of science and
reason," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Mbeki had been instrumental in driving AIDS
initiatives when he was deputy president, and "continues to place
this issue on top of the national and continental agenda".
</P>
<P>
Mandela also committed his foundation to exploring ways in
which it could get involved in the battle to contain the scourge.
</P>
<P>
He said it was up to Africans to fight the disease ravaging its
people.
</P>
<P>
"Others will not save us if we do not primarily commit
ourselves," Mandela said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Start Final Phase of Land Redistribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday said the government will start the final phase of land
redistribution on Saturday, despite criticisms from countries like
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the burial of former Political Commissar Cephas
Cele who died in Bulawayo last week, Mugabe said the government
will not tolerate any impediments on the land issue because it had
stayed unsolved for too long.
</P>
<P>
"When we talk about the need to redistribute land, voices ring
from those who empowered themselves yesterday, they say we are
practising racism and grabbing land," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the invasion of about 1,600 mostly white-owned
commercial farms by war veterans was a clear sign that blacks were
desperate to retake their forefathers' land stolen by settlers.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain, Zimbabwe's former colonial master, had refused
to give financial assistance for the land redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
"The call still rings, give us our land. I say to you, your
land starts coming tomorrow and tomorrow is D-day for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has announced that it will
compulsorily acquire 5 million hectares of land from the white
farmers to distribute landless Zimbabweans.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: World Awakened to Gravity of AIDS, but More Action Needed by Yu Dabo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The 13th International AIDS
Conference, with the theme of "breaking silence", ended in Durban,
South Africa on Friday after focusing world attention on the
gravity of the disease.
</P>
<P>
About 13,000 delegates from across the world reiterated their
commitment to curbing the pandemic, but frustration was also
shared by the delegates over the disproportionate spread of
resources to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
The conference came to the conclusion that governments,
scientists, businesses and activists all play a part in driving
the AIDS pandemic to the forefront of the global agenda.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has claimed 18.8 million lives since the first
AIDS patient was diagnosed in 1981. Now almost 35 million people
are suffering from the disease, with the majority in developing
countries, the sub-Saharan Africa in particular.
</P>
<P>
The dominant theme at the six-day conference had been the need
for poor countries, which bear the brunt of the pandemic, to have
access to expensive treatment that is only available to wealthy
countries.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that 12 million AIDS sufferers in developing
countries would die in the next five years because of the
prohibitive cost of anti-retroviral drugs and the failing health
care infrastructures of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 90 percent of those who need HIV
drugs have no way of getting them, fueling the spread of the
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, thousands of people living with the disease in the
industrialized world led relatively full and healthy lives because
they had access to medicine which suppressed the HIV and treated
opportunist infections.
</P>
<P>
But to buy anti-retroviral drugs at current prices for all
those who need them would cost 60 billion U.S. dollars a year,
making the anti-AIDS task too formidable for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Some delegates also associated the spread of AIDS with
worsening poverty in developing countries. They shared the view of
South African President Thabo Mbeki that the world's biggest
killer and greatest cause of ill-health and suffering was extreme
poverty, and not the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
There had been a strong call for debt relief so as to allow
developing countries to have more resources to fight AIDS. African
debt servicing amounts to 15 billion dollars annually, and the
continent was in need of about 3 billion dollars every year for
basic AIDS prevention and treatment.
</P>
<P>
African delegates noted that without debt relief, African
countries would lack resources to fight the war over AIDS. The
conference, however, seemingly have failed to persuade developed
countries to come to African countries' recuse with debt relief.
</P>
<P>
International Monetary Fund managing director Horst Kohler said
during the conference that simply writing off Africa's debt was
not a wise option, as it may serve as a disincentive for Africans
to do something to improve their own situation.
</P>
<P>
This prompted African delegates to call for more reliance on
African efforts to seek a solution suitable for the African
continent through coordinated efforts. African scientists launched
the African Strategy for an HIV vaccine at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference disclosed that two main strains of the virus
were found in Africa, and African scientists will focus on
developing a "broad" vaccine which could effectively deal with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Also encouraging was the announcement by the South African
government that a new vaccine Nevirapine has been developed as a
cheaper alternative to AZT in reducing mother-to-child
transmissions. Research revealed that only two doses of Nevirapine,
at a cost of about four dollars, would significantly reduce the
number of babies who tested HIV positive after birth.
</P>
<P>
The much-expected conference also offered other encouraging
signs. The U.N. anti-AIDS agency, UNAIDS, has sought to bring down
the cost of drugs used in combinations from between 25,000 dollars
and 12,000 dollars a year, to below 1,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under mounting pressure, pharmaceutical companies have begun
announcing donations of medicine and money to help African
countries fight the devastating AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) released a
detailed working five-year agenda on Monday, vowing to make AIDS
vaccines available to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the international Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation pledged 50 million dollars over five years to help
South Africa strengthen its primary health care system. The number
of South African AIDS victims is estimated at 4.2 million, the
highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical giant Merck and Co. also announced it would join
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in donating 100 million
dollars worth of medicine and money to help fight AIDS in Botswana,
where nearly 36 percent of adults are infected.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, meanwhile, announced it had set aside 500
million dollars for anti-AIDS programs in African countries.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission also announced it was beginning a new
initiative which will work to expand access to existing prevention
and treatment options.
</P>
<P>
These joint efforts were boosted when the U.S. pledged a budget
of over 200 million dollars for this year to stop the spread of
AIDS in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
The conference has seen the world mobilized to confront the
challenge of AIDS. But it's widely hoped that the best of the
gathering can be translated into policy and, the more important,
be put into action.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's House of Representatives Gives Red Card to IMF Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Lower chamber of Nigeria's top
legislature, the House of Representatives, has passed a motion,
barring the government from taking a 1 billion U. S. dollar loan
offered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The government must make all the details of the conditions
going with the loan clear to the House first, Nigerian press
Friday quoted the House leaders as saying.
</P>
<P>
The House leaders said on Thursday before passing the motion
that the government's move regarding to the loan appeared ill-
advised, considering that Nigeria is currently owing its foreign
creditors about 30 billion dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
They said in view of the ongoing efforts to secure debt
cancellation, it would be unwise to go into another commitment
that is likely to worsen the country's indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government earlier barred all of its agencies from
borrowing money without its acceding, but saying that the interest
of the IMF loan is "very favorable" therefore beneficial to the
country.

<HEADLINE> Africa's First Batch of Trolleys Produced: Malawian Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Malawi's Plumbing and Engineering
Works Company (PEW), which usually manufactures buses, claimed it
has become the first firm on the African continent to manufacture
rail trolleys locally, a report reaching here said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Using locally available raw materials and a 460,000-U.S.-dollar
World Bank loan, the company has produced six so-called gang
trolleys with a franchise licence from Wickham Rail Cars of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Wickham Rail Cars contracted out the company to produce the
trolleys under a Malawi railway system's restructuring process.
</P>
<P>
The first company to buy the trolleys is the Central Africa
Railways (CEAR), a consortium of American and Mozambican rail
companies, which has just won a 20-year concession to run the
railway system in Malawi.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Declares Site of Oil Pipeline Fire Disaster Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has declared
the site of last Monday's oil pipeline fire disaster area and
barred further entry into it, press here reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken to avert further explosion because the
air was still pregnant with petrol fumes, according to Environment
Minister of State Ime Okopido,
</P>
<P>
The minister, who led a Federal Government team to the scene on
Thursday, directed security agencies in the state, the Pipelines
and Products Marketing Company (PPMC) and the local government to
provide an indefinite round-the-clock security in the area, adding
that defaulters of the order should be apprehended.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened last Monday when people were using
buckets to collect petrol flowing from the pipeline after it had
been punctured by thieves on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
About 300 people have been confirmed dead in the accident.

<HEADLINE> Railway Line Closure Costs Mozambique 7.5 Million U.S. dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The closure of the flood-wrecked
Limpopo Railway Line, linking Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of
Maputo, has so far cost the Mozambican publicly-owned ports and
railway companies some 7.5 million U.S. dollars, said reports
reaching here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Mozambican CFM Company said that with the
534-kilometer railway line paralyzed, the company sees the losses
running some 50,000 dollars per day, as the Zimbabwean exports
destined for Maputo have to be transferred to South African ports.
</P>
<P>
CFM has begun emergency rehabilitation on the worst affected
stretches at a cost of 7 million dollars and hopes that the line
will be operational by September, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Major work on the line is currently under way in Chokwe
district, located in south Mozambique along the Limpopo river,
where 14 kilometers of track was destroyed by the flooding of the
river caused by cyclones earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> High Malnutrition Rate Among Kenyan Children in Drought-hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Malnutrition rates among Kenyan
children under five years old are unacceptably high as a result of
drought which has been declared a national disaster in 19
districts throughout the country, the U.N.Children's Fund (UNICEF)
has said.
</P>
<P>
A press release from UNICEF reaching here Friday said a food
and nutrition survey in six districts carried out in June by the
agency and the Applied Nutrition Program, University of Nairobi,
attests to this fact.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered some worst-affected divisions in Turkana,
Marsabit and Moyale districts in northern Kenya, and Mandera,
Wajir and Garissa districts in northeastern Kenya. The data
collected included weight, height and mid-upper circumference.
</P>
<P>
Based on weight for height, the malnutrition rates were: 37.2
percent in Kerio Division of Turkana, 35.2 percent in Loyeingalani
Division of Marsabit, 32.6 percent in Griftu Division of Wajir, 29.
4 percent in Shimbri Division of Mandera and 27.2 percent in
Modoogashe Division of Garissa and 17.3 percent in Obbu Division
of Moyale.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said the results of the nutrition survey are being used
to better target supplementary feeding activities in the affected
areas.
</P>
<P>
The agency is ready to distribute 484 tons of UNIMIX (a high-
protein food specially for children under five) to the affected
population in Kenya, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, UNICEF is continuing its field emergency support
activities in water and sanitation sector and directly supporting
the maintenance, rehabilitation or installation of over 50 water
supply points in Turkana, Wajir and Garissa.
</P>
<P>
Forty additional pumps are being dispatched to the affected
districts for installation in sites being drilled by the Kenya
Army and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
In order to continue to provide health and nutrition
interventions in the affected areas, UNICEF needs an additional 1
million U.S. dollars for vaccines, needles, syringes, vitamin A,
UNIMIX and cold chain equipment, the release added.

<HEADLINE> European Musicians Want End to CD Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The music industry on Thursday
urged the European Union to get tougher with Internet piracy and
urged the world's CD consumers to stop cyber shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry,which
represents the global recording industry, backs the high-level
star-studded campaign against Internet music sharing through
companies such as Napster Inc., whose service allows computer
users to make perfect copies of digital recordings over the net.
</P>
<P>
The federation warned that Internet pirates are the big new
threat to the business with at least 25 million illegal files
available and up to 1 billion downloaded each year.
</P>
<P>
French composer Jean Michel Jarre has gathered over 1,400
signatures from artists around Europe calling for stronger
protection.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was time to stop considering the work of
musicians as toothpaste. "Six hundred thousand people work in the
music industry in Europe alone," he added.
</P>
<P>
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry
criticized that the existing European Union anti-piracy proposals
were too lax.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, first proposed to update copyright rules in 1998 to take
into account digital revolution by allowing private copying over
the computer networks.
</P>
<P>
The proposals have been discussed at length in the European
Parliament and by the governments of the EU member states. If
approved in the Autumn, private copying would be allowed unless
individual governments outlaw it.

<HEADLINE> Chile Formalizes Request for Mercosur Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chile formalized Thursday its
request for adhering to the Southern Common Market (Mercosur),
Brazil's Minister of Foreign Affairs Luis Felipe Lampreia
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chile could become one of the bloc's effective members in
coming December during a Mercosur summit in Florinapoles, Brazil,
through an additional protocol to the Asuncion Treaty, Lampreia
said before the banquet offered by President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso to his Chilean counterpart, Ricardo Lagos, who is visiting
here.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the two leaders decided Thursday
morning during talks to begin effective negotiations to make Chile
's adhering Mercosur a reality.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations will hinge around four points, Lampreia explained.
The first point is adhering to norms and rules already approved by
Mercosur. The second refers to the question of macroeconomic
convergence, which is the path of the bloc's economic union, said
the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Quickening and deepening of free trade between Chileans and the
bloc is the third point, whose objective is to get as quick as
possible a zero tax between Chile and Mercosur member countries,
and widen quotas and horizons, Lampreia explained.
</P>
<P>
The fourth point refers to the Common External Tax, considered
as the main obstacle for Chile's full entry to Mercosur, because
there are "notorious and sensible" differences between both sides
in this matter, according to Lampreia.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Chile is only an associate member, along with
Bolivia, of the Mercosur, which is composed by Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay.

<HEADLINE> EU to Let Data Deal With U.S. Stand As It Is </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Thursday
said that there was no need to amend the trans-Atlantic deal on
data protection though the European Parliament had raised concerns
about its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
The union's Internal Market Commissioner Frits Bolkestein felt
that the deal offered Europeans enough protection for personal
data transferred to the United States, according to European
Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted the commissioner as adding that he would
recommend that the commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, give the deal its final go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
The governments of the 15 EU member states have already
approved the data protection deal, yet the European Parliament
last week rejected the deal in a non-binding resolution. The
legislators argued that key provisions need to be re-negotiated to
strengthen data privacy and protection.
</P>
<P>
Some European as well as American business people have opposed
the deal, saying that individual privacy rights were not strong
enough while Bolkestein said that he would re-negotiate only if
those rights were violated.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on a data protection pact dated back to the
introduction of EU data privacy rules that had been passed in 1998
to give national regulators the right to stop information from
being sent to other countries that lack adequate data protection
laws.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one such country that does not have data
protection laws but relies on a self-regulatory system to ensure
data privacy.
</P>
<P>
The trans-Atlantic data protection deal was designed to
facilitate easier transfer of consumer data in the insurance,
financial services, tourism and aviation sectors.

<HEADLINE> Witness Absence Should Not Wreck Trial: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Law experts on
Thursday said that the refusal of some witnesses to testify at the
Lockerbie trial should not wreck the court procedure.
</P>
<P>
They argued that the absence of witnesses listed to give
evidence on airport security around Malta's Luqa was a hindrance
to the prosecution but not an obstacle to wreck the trial.
</P>
<P>
Court proceedings were adjourned for one day on Wednesday after
an undisclosed number of witnesses had refused to travel to the
Scottish court on Dutch soil to testify.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that it was not clear how crucial the absence of
the Maltese witnesses to testify would finally be but that some
other avenues remained open to obtain the testimony on Luqa
airport security.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleges Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin
Khalifa Fahima placed a bomb in a suitcase which was then placed
on an Air Malta jet departing from Luqa on the morning of December
21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day the suitcase was transferred onto the New York-
bound Pan Am Flight 103 that was blown out of the sky over
Lockerbie, killing all 259 people on board and 11 others on the
ground in the Scottish town.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans went on trial on May 3 before the Scottish
court at Camp Zeist, a former U.S. air force base in central
Netherlands. They are charged with conspiracy of murder,and
breach of international aircraft safety laws.
</P>
<P>
Al-Megrahi and Fhimah both pleaded innocent to the charges
which carry a maximum life sentence in a Scottish jail.
</P>
<P>
One of the prosecution's principal witnesses is a Libyan
defector who allegedly saw one of the defendants introduce the
suitcase onto the Air Malta flight at Luqa.
</P>
<P>
The trial, that got underway after almost 12 years of
investigation and preparation, was adjourned several times for
both technical and witness reasons.
</P>
<P>
The court was last adjourned for 12 days to give the
prosecution extra time to examine the statements given by
witnesses lifted by the defense team just prior to the start of
the trial.
