<HEADLINE> German Pro Sieben TV Network Takes Lead in Going Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Pro Sieben AG today became the first
German television broadcaster to list its shares on the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Pro Sieben preference shares met strong
interest from about one million private investors who drove the
share price to 95 German marks (54.3 U.S. dollars) on the first
trading day from the originally planned 72 marks (41.1 dollars).
</P>
<P>
"It's a perfect start," the German private TV network said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 850 million shares were ordered, though only 17.5
million will be sold on the market, the company said. The issue
will raise 1.26 billion marks (720 million dollars) for the
company and increase its capital by 360 million marks (206 million
dollars) to more than 700 million (400 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to improve its program, and probably,
to take over other TV broadcasters, the company said.

<HEADLINE> BA Faces Strike Chaos as Talks Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Air travelers face 72 hours of
chaos when British Airways (BA) cabin crew go on strike after
talks to settle their dispute collapsed last night.
</P>
<P>
BA will be forced to ground thousands of flights from 6am on
Wednesday as each side blamed the other for the latest breakdown.
</P>
<P>
The dispute involve BA's 9,000 cabin crew staff who voted by a
2-1 majority in a secret ballot last month for industrial action.
BA's proposals were accepted by the small breakaway Cabin Crew 89
union.
</P>
<P>
Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, said BA wanted a strike and "was prepared to
incite it" no matter what damage was done to the traveling public.
</P>
<P>
However, Robert Ayling, BA chief executive, regretted that the
union was not prepared to resolve the dispute through "reasonable"
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
BA said it now had "no option" but to implement its contingency
plans from Wednesday. These will involve using replacement staff
to do cabin crew work on some flights.
</P>
<P>
It is reported BA is to take out advertisements in newspapers
showing which flights will be operating. The information will also
be on Teletext.
</P>
<P>
BA says it will try to employ "short-term staff and volunteers"
to keep to its schedules.
</P>
<P>
Staff in the company claim that the airline is concentrating on
recruiting a strike-breaking army rather than resolving their
dispute over restructuring contracts.

PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- France today urged a "return of the

<HEADLINE> Joulwan: Nato Policy Unchanged About Indictees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Nato's outgoing military chief
General George Joulwan said on Monday that there is no change in
the policy of Nato-led Stablization Force (SFOR) regarding war
crime indictees.
</P>
<P>
"The instructions that I received (on this issue) have not
changed," said Joulwan, who will retire after four years as
Supreme Allied Commander for Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Nato policy has been that SFOR soldiers will not arrest war
crime indictees unless they come across those persons. But some
American media have reported that the Clinton administration is
planning to nab those indicted persons with special forces.
</P>
<P>
Joulwan said that whether there will be a change of the Nato
mandate will be determined by the capitals of the Nato countries.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of war criminals needs to be addressed at the
political level," he said, "what needs to happen is that the
political will needs to be there if I am to receive a different
mandate."
</P>
<P>
Joulwan, who has commanded Nato-led peace-keeping forces for the
past 18 months, said he believed that Western countries should
continue to presure the Bosnian parties to hand in by themselves
the war crime indictees.
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe that the parties themselves must come to grips
with understanding that these indicted war criminals needs to be
brought to justice in the Hague, the parties themselves have this
responsibility," he added.

PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed worry over the
rising tension on the Israeli-Lebanese border, where Israeli
troops and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah Shiite guerrillas shelled
each other over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried about the renewal of tension on the

"France appeals to all the parties to exercise restraint,"
said the spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Airlines Ready for Privatization: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Air Botswana General Manager
Joshua Galeforolwe said in Gaborone today that his company is
expected to start privatization operation in August.
</P>
<P>
"We were told by the government that as soon as we become
profitable, we would be privatized," the South African Press
Association quoted Galeforolwe as reporting.
</P>
<P>
According to Galeforolwe, Air Botswana recorded the first net
profit in March this year ever since it was formed in 1965.
Figures will be announced in August, he said.
</P>
<P>
Galeforolwe took the airlines from annual 20-million Pula
(5.77 million U.S. Dollars) losses to turning a profit in three
years after the government told him it was sink or swim and
refused further loans.
</P>
<P>
Galeforolwe said he had a plan for privatization ready to put
on the table. "We have been talking to many parties, including
the International Finance Corporation...They have made us a
proposal which we are taking up with the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The general manager believes that it will be at least two,
maybe three, years before privatization can be concluded in his
company.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Calls on Justice Ministry Be More Active </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin on Monday called on the Justice Ministry to be more
active in Russian social life.
</P>
<P>
Presenting Sergei Stepashin, the new head of the Justice
Ministry, Chernomyrdin noted that "the Ministry of Justice should
increase its role," while "most control over the government's
lawmaking work" should be concentrated in the Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hatred to the situation that "the country
would live by temporary resolutions and decrees".
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin stressed the need to broaden the functions of the
ministry following Russia's accession to the Council of Europe and
its obligation to bring its legislation in line with European
norms.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also suggested the government should provide
financial support and even a new building for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin is to replace Valentin Kovalyov who has been
dismissed from the ministerial post after a Moscow newspaper
published what it said were stills of a video tape showing him in
a gangland sauna frolicking with naked women.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin declined to comment on the scandal around
Kovalyov, saying that it is "a shame for both the government and
the ministry."
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized Kovalyov for bad work and recalled a
couple of incidents when the minister opposed some document
discussed at a government meeting although earlier it had been
approved by the Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin recently told the Itar-Tass in an interview that he
will start in his new job by restructuring the ministry and
launching a large-scale justice reform.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin headed the Federal Security Service in 1994 and 1995,
but had to step down after Chechen guerrilla's raid on the
southern Russian town of Budennovsk in mid-1995 which claimed over
100 lives.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed head of the administrative department of the
Russian government in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin was appointed justice minister by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin on July 2.

<HEADLINE> New Israeli Finance Minister to Be Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu is expected to appoint former Justice Minister Yaacov
Neeman as new finance minister soon, possibly late today, ending
weeks of speculation about the cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
In order to complete the long-delayed cabinet reshuffle
following the resignation of former Finance Minister Dan Meridor
last month, Netanyahu held intensive consultations today on the
line-up of the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio reported that Netanyahu could present the
appointment of Neeman as early as tonight to the Knesset
(Parliament) for approval. The Knesset will debate two
non-confidence motions filed by the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Neeman resigned from the justice portfolio last August after
the state prosecution decided to open a criminal investigation
against him for obstructing justice during the investigation of
the bribery case involving Shas Party leader Aryeh Deri. But he
was acquitted of the charges on May 16 by the High Court, which
paved the way for his return to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
By way of Neeman's appointment, Netanyahu solved the thorny
problem of appointing National Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon to the finance portfolio in his original plan.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has conditioned his transfer to the new post on his
inclusion into the inner security cabinet comprising of Netanyahu,
Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who has been threatening to leave the coalition in the
past weeks, is reportedly opposed to the inclusion of the
ultra-rightist Sharon into the inner cabinet. He insists on his
sole authority as the man in charge of the peace talks with the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has held three meetings with Levy in a bid to solve
the crisis that could topple the government. A deal is said to be
near to define Levy's role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sharon reportedly has given his blessing to Neeman's
appointment following the promise by Netanyahu to grant him a
greater say in the government decision making over security and
diplomatic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said the prime minister would
consult from time to time with Levy, Mordechai and Sharon on the
security and diplomatic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The reappointment of Neeman, an observant Jew who does not
belong to any party but is closely linked to the religious
communities, was especially welcomed by the religious parties
which are Likud's major ruling partners.
</P>
<P>
The reaction from the opposition camp was mixed. Former
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat of the Labor Party praised
Neeman, who has served as former director-general and attorney of
the Finance Ministry, as a professional candidate.
</P>
<P>
But Shohat also expressed disappointment at Neeman for his
close association with the Orthodox religious parties which are
stalling the peace process with their tough positions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it remained still unclear who would be appointed to
the science portfolio, which has been vacated since former
minister Benny Begin resigned in January to protest the signing
of the Israeli-Palestinian Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Michael Eitan, head of Likud faction in the Knesset, and Likud
lawmaker Silvan Shalom are the two leading candidates for the
science minister.

In a report on micro and small enterprises in Africa released

The report said one of the major impediments to SME
development is that foreign donor agencies, generally influenced
by research from the North, direct research on the crucial
sector.
</P>
<P>
The report said, "their research agenda and implied models of
development often have conformed to their own interests and
perspectives, and had been less attentive to the needs, interests
and development goals of the local users of research findings and
the ultimate beneficiaries."
</P>
<P>
Few entrepreneurs were consulted about research objectives and
the research outcome was ineffective in addressing the pressing
needs, the report said, adding that this wasted limited resources
and undermined local action-oriented research capacity.
</P>
<P>
It suggested demand and action-oriented research which
supports a wide range of SME development be carried out by
professional researchers and non-research stakeholders with
intended beneficiaries also fully involved.
</P>
<P>
SMEs, better known as the informal sector, have been viewed by
most African governments as a method of combating unemployment,
reducing wide income disparities, enhancing national productive
capacities and improving access to basic goods and services in
respect of the poorer majority.

<HEADLINE> 41 Zimbabwean Companies Liquidated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 41 Zimbabwean companies,
mostly in the textile sector, have been liquidated so far this
year compared with 63 for the whole of last year, a business
information and service provider said today.
</P>
<P>
Dun and Bradstreet Zimbabwe Managing Director Fernando Aleixo
said that 16 companies had been declared insolvent so far this
year, up from 18 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He, however, could not say how many people had lost jobs as a
result.
</P>
<P>
"The section which has been most affected is the textile
industry. This is due to the competition from South Africa and
other countries, and the large amount of second-hand clothing
coming into the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The other areas also affected included the leather and
engineering sectors which were also facing stiff competition as a
result of the opening up of the economy under the structural
adjustment program, he added.
</P>
<P>
Notable among the companies liquidated last year were Cone
Textiles, one of the country's largest textile concerns which
went into liquidation in 1995 making about 4,000 workers jobless,
the source said.

<HEADLINE> FM: Egypt Resists Assassination Attempts on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is resisting the attempts to
assassinate the Mideast peace process and exerting its utmost to
salvage the peace march, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the foundered peace process, Moussa said these
endeavors can be realized by not respecting the signed agreements
and planting obstacles before reaching just and balanced peace
whether on Palestinian, Syrian or Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and any sensible country in the region should take up
the responsibility for resisting peace-assassination attempts,
Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone concerned with this issue should rescue the peace
march from such attempts," he added.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Palestinian leader's call for holding an Arab
Summit to confront Israeli recalcitrance, Moussa said that the
Arabs maintain consultations to handle the situation. However, no
date or venue has been determined as yet, according to Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat dismissed the question that major
world powers are not concerned with Israeli attempts to blow up
peace, saying that everyone is trying to salvage the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"We can not accuse anyone of condoning the serious crisis
facing the peace drive," Moussa said. "Neither the U.S., Russia,
nor Europe could accept that," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We all shoulder the responsibility of salvaging the peace
process and restoring the basic principle of the peace march,
namely land for peace," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The summit of the seven industrialized states plus Russia
recently held in Denver, U.S., stressed that the peace process
can not be salvaged except through the land for peace principle,
he added.
</P>
<P>
International mediating efforts have failed to bring the
Palestinians and Israelis back to the negotiating table three
months after the peace talks collapsed when Israel began building
a new neighborhood for Jews.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has stepped in as the main mediator between the two
sides over the past few weeks as a result of what many Arabs
perceive as a lack of U.S. interest in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Begins Vacation in Petrozavodsk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
spent his first day of vacation by taking a ride in a speed boat
on lake Ukshezero, Karelia, and by fishing, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported from Petrozavodsk.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, claiming that he liked the location of the Summer
house where he is vacationing, inspected an in-door tennis court
built in time for his arrival and tried out a new tennis racket
and a couple of tennis balls.
</P>
<P>
As usual, the president will not be able to get away from state
concerns completely and he is expected to combine vacationing with
work.
</P>
<P>
It is said that First Vice-Premier Boris Nemtsov is expected to
arrive to Karelia on Tuesday for a discussion of current affairs
with the Russian head of state.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin arrived in Karelia on Sunday where he will spend part
of his annual leave.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will probably tour Karelia, where he was elected a
delegate to the 19th All-Union Communist Party conference in old
times. Then, he arrived here in the Summer of 1990 on the eve of
the first elections of Russian President. He came here the last
time in August 1993 when there was a meeting of the heads of the
Russian Federation's subjects in Petrozavodsk.
</P>
<P>
During his vacation the president is also expected to visit the
republic's capital Petrozavodsk, the paper-making center at
Kondopoga, the island of Kizhi and lake Onega, the report said.

<HEADLINE> British Govt Condemns Violence in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary, Mo Mowlam, today condemned "orchestrated violence" that
swept the province overnight in protest at a Protestant parade.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland saw the worst outbreak of nationalist unrest
in years early Monday morning in which rioters and police clashed
in Belfast, Londonderry and other towns after an Orange Order
march through a Catholic area of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Mowlam said: "I understand the anger
there is in nationalist communities, but nothing justified the
orchestrated violence that we have seen in the last 24 hours."
</P>
<P>
She also appealed the Protestant Orange Order to display
"willingness and understanding" in the holding of parades as their
annual "marching season" reaches its high point this week.
</P>
<P>
"There can and should be no triumphalism," she added.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair backed Mowlam in the Northern
Ireland peace efforts and pledged to press on with the search for
peace through year-old Northern Ireland talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to go on searching for peace. We will not give
up, even for a moment," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, called for
"calm and dignified" protests, saying the rioting was
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said: "We want to call for an
end to the hijackings and burnings."
</P>
<P>
The display of firepower by the Irish Republican Army in
overnight unrest across the divided province was the biggest in
years and the outpouring of nationalist fury appeared to mark the
end of any honeymoon with Britain's new Labor government.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Bank Chief Calls for Combating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Central Bank chief today
urged regulatory authorities worldwide to adopt appropriate
measures to combat money laundering, stressing that fighting money
laundering is an international problem.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus Afxentis Afxentiou was
speaking at a three-day international conference on money
laundering which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
He called upon regulatory authorities worldwide to remain
vigilant, keeping under constant review the development of new
money laundering techniques.
</P>
<P>
The conference will examine issues such as the impact of
organized crime on national and the world financial systems, and
suggestions for developing a response to international organized
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Afxentiou revealed that the amount of money laundered each year
in the world's financial system exceeds 500 billion U.S. dollars,
noting that the vastness of the amounts of money involved poses a
severe danger to the world financial system, threatening the
smooth functioning of financial markets.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that 70 percent of laundered funds are drug-
related, while other offenses include illegal arms deals,
premeditated murders, abduction, smuggling and product
counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
It seems that organized crime is turning into "a threat to most
of us, to financial institutions, and to the society as a whole,"
Afxentiou said.
</P>
<P>
The abolition of exchange controls in most countries and
liberalization and globalization of financial markets have
facilitated money laundering, the governor added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that organized crime can now operate across
national borders more easily and speedily, taking advantage of
the latest technological innovations, such as electronic banking
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, participants from the United States,
Britain, Switzerland and other countries will express their
views and submit suggestions on efforts to combat money
laundering.

<HEADLINE> Military Junta Faces Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 7 (Xinhua)- Six weeks after seizing power from
the civilian government of president Tejan Kabbah, the military
junta in Sierra Leone is now faced with a shortage of petroleum
products including black oil to generate electricity in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, motorists have been queuing to buy only
three gallons of petrol for each vehicle. Most queues run as far
as a mile and obervers say if the trend continues, a long stretch
is likely to build up as from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the state-run National Petroleum
(NP), the ration "will shortly be reduced to two gallons".
</P>
<P>
"We are nearly reaching the bottom of the barrel. We usually
have a three month buffer stock but this is what we have been
using since the coup. No order has yet been placed and oil
tankers have been frightened off by the insecurity of the
situation".
</P>
<P>
A west African diplomat noted that the main bulk of petroleum
imports come from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Given the present chill between Abuja and the Junta in
Freetown, I doubt whether the Nigerians would be prepared to send
a single drop", he told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Under Sierra Leone's structural adjustmant programme, the
World Bank for the past three years has been paying for all oil
importation into the country. The commodity is then sold and the
money recycled for fresh imports.
</P>
<P>
The bank has however suspended all assistance on June 19 as a
reaction to the May 25 coup and canncelled nine other projects
according to Mamadou Diallo, country officer for Sierra Leone at
the bank's Washington office in a letter sent to finance ministry
officials here.
</P>
<P>
They include agricultural sector support of 21,000,000
dollars, infrastructural project for Freetown, 26,000,000
dollars, techmical assistance, 10,000,000 dollars, urban water
supply 36,000.000 dollars, transport sector 35,000,000 dollars
and housing sector, 20,000,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Diallo, total figues in terms of commitments is
about 264.65 million dollars which has now been cancelled.
</P>
<P>
"Any decision to resume any World Bank programme will depend
on the extent to which present conditions chance", he added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Unveils Plan to Improve Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- British Education and Employment
Secretary David Blunkett published a White Paper policy statement
today aimed at taking control of schools and improving education
standards.
</P>
<P>
"Children don't get a second chance in school. This White Paper
is a vital step in our crusade to raise standards and offer
opportunity to all of them," Blunkett said in his speech to
parliament while unveiling his new education plan.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper aims to raise the number of children leaving
primary school at 11 who have reached the expected reading
standard for that age to 80 percent by 2001 from 57 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
Under the education plan, all primary schools will be ordered
to devote an hour each day to the two subjects.
</P>
<P>
The government will also take powers to replace local councils
in running schools which do not meet targets and warns that
teachers who do not perform adequately will be subject to "speedy
but fair" dismissal.
</P>
<P>
In the campaign for the May 1 election, Prime Minister Tony
Blair promised his voters he would put education on the top
priority of his agenda once he moved to Downing Street to govern
the country.

LUANDA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of the Interior
Pitra Petroff said here today that the governments of Angola and
the Democratic Republic of Congo will cooperate to guarantee
peace and stability in their border regions.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to reporters before leaving for a 24-hour
visit to former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the border regions between the neighboring
countries is still tense, the Angolan minister said, noting that
former Zairean government soldiers and Angola's UNITA movement
soldiers are continuing to make trouble there to destabilize the
border regions.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he is going to hold discussions with
his Congolese counterpart during his visit to find specific
measures for security in the border regions.
</P>
<P>
Petroff added that the Angolan government is now taking action
to restore rule of law, order and public security.
</P>
<P>
Angola is bordered with the Democratic Republic of Congo on
the north and northeast. Their boundary line is 2,600 kilometers
long.
</P>
<P>
The overthrow of the former Zairean government by Laurent
Kabila and his force in May this year had forced many former
Zairean government soldiers to flee to the border areas, whose
presence there is posing a threat to public security there.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Distances from Idea of Mideast Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has shown
no interest in advancing the plan of forming a Middle East Bank,
a symbol of the regional economic cooperation in an era of peace.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has
not sent signals to Washington expressing its support for the
bank, despite the fact that it was asked to express its view,
The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Barring a last-minute push by Netanyahu during his visit to
Washington this week, U.S. congressional funding for the bank is
liable to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The bank was not part of the U.S. House of Representatives
foreign aid legislation, and the Senate Appropriations Committee
did not include it in the 12.15 billion U.S. dollars foreign aid
bill which is expected to reach the floor within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the bank was the centerpiece of the
U.S.-backed Amman economic summit of the Middle East and North
African Countries in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had originally agreed to provide more than 260
million dollars, or 21 percent, of the bank's start-up capital
over five years. The money was to finance infrastructure
projects in Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Netanyahu government has not prioritized the
bank.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Gravity Flow Scheme Improves Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- For the past ten years, Uganda has
carried out a Gravity Flow Scheme (GFS) in a bid to improve
people's sanitation status, enabling about 300,000 people
currently to benefit from the program.
</P>
<P>
GFS refers to a water supply system whereby water is tapped
from a spring, river or lake and transported through pipes to
communal taps in lower areas. There is no need for external power
to transport the water because the water source is at a higher
altitude than all the other points of the system.
</P>
<P>
Therefore it is a method for people to spend little money to
access safe drinking. "Users of the scheme normally pay only
between 400 shillings and 500 shillings (1,050 Ugandan shillings
equal to one U.S. dollar) per cubic metre of the water," said Mr.
Kisembo who is in charge of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
In the last ten years, cooperative arrangements have been
established between non-governmental organisations, donors,
public bodies and local communities to carry out the scheme while
central government has been responsible for resource mobilisation
and technical support to districts in the country through
district water offices.
</P>
<P>
Up to now 45 GFS are operational and, as a result, 300,000
Ugandans are getting access to safe drinking water and improved
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 34 schemes are under construction, 24 schemes have
been designed and 77 schemes have been identified with potential
for development.
</P>
<P>
According to Ugandan Ministry of Natural Resources, when fully
developed by the year 2000, these 135 schemes can benefit a total
of 800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the ministry shows that at least another
150 potential sources exist to meet the needs for a further
700,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Therefore it is evident that sufficient gravity flow schemes
potential exists to benefit approximately 1.5 million people in
the country, which is about 9 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
In other words, the GFS potential may contribute significantly
to increase the safe water coverage to 35 percent of the rural
areas at present. The figure has been steadily increasing at an
average rate of 1-2 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is endowed with rich water resources, for 15 percent of
the country is covered by lakes and rivers. Ground water reserves
are also adequate in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite these favorable conditions, however, 65 percent of the
population cannot get access to safe drinking water at present.
This causes constant incidences of water related diseases such as
cholera, dysentery and Guinea worm in the country, resulting in
high mortality rate especially among children.
</P>
<P>
For the rest 35 percent of the population who can drink safe
water, 2.85 million get it by boreholes and 262,800 people get it
by shallow wells, whereas 3.091 million obtain it by protected
springs and 50,000 by rain water catchment, besides 300,000 by
GFS.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Gravity Flow Scheme Improves Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- For the past ten years, Uganda has
carried out a Gravity Flow Scheme (GFS) in a bid to improve
people's sanitation status, enabling about 300,000 people
currently to benefit from the program.
</P>
<P>
GFS refers to a water supply system whereby water is tapped
from a spring, river or lake and transported through pipes to
communal taps in lower areas. There is no need for external power
to transport the water because the water source is at a higher
altitude than all the other points of the system.
</P>
<P>
Therefore it is a method for people to spend little money to
access safe drinking. "Users of the scheme normally pay only
between 400 shillings and 500 shillings (1,050 Ugandan shillings
equal to one U.S. dollar) per cubic metre of the water," said Mr.
Kisembo who is in charge of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
In the last ten years, cooperative arrangements have been
established between non-governmental organisations, donors,
public bodies and local communities to carry out the scheme while
central government has been responsible for resource mobilisation
and technical support to districts in the country through
district water offices.
</P>
<P>
Up to now 45 GFS are operational and, as a result, 300,000
Ugandans are getting access to safe drinking water and improved
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 34 schemes are under construction, 24 schemes have
been designed and 77 schemes have been identified with potential
for development.
</P>
<P>
According to Ugandan Ministry of Natural Resources, when fully
developed by the year 2000, these 135 schemes can benefit a total
of 800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the ministry shows that at least another
150 potential sources exist to meet the needs for a further
700,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Therefore it is evident that sufficient gravity flow schemes
potential exists to benefit approximately 1.5 million people in
the country, which is about 9 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
In other words, the GFS potential may contribute significantly
to increase the safe water coverage to 35 percent of the rural
areas at present. The figure has been steadily increasing at an
average rate of 1-2 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is endowed with rich water resources, for 15 percent of
the country is covered by lakes and rivers. Ground water reserves
are also adequate in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite these favorable conditions, however, 65 percent of the
population cannot get access to safe drinking water at present.
This causes constant incidences of water related diseases such as
cholera, dysentery and Guinea worm in the country, resulting in
high mortality rate especially among children.
</P>
<P>
For the rest 35 percent of the population who can drink safe
water, 2.85 million get it by boreholes and 262,800 people get it
by shallow wells, whereas 3.091 million obtain it by protected
springs and 50,000 by rain water catchment, besides 300,000 by
GFS.

OTTAWA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The value of building permits issued for
housing in Canada rose for the second consecutive month in May,
although non-residential construction levels were off, Statistics
Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
Municipalities issued permits for housing worth 1.1 billion U.S.
dollars, up 1.4 percent from April. This followed declines in both
long- and short-term mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the value of non-residential permits dropped after four
consecutive increases. Permits were down 28.6 percent in May to 630
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The level in April was exceptional, the highest in almost seven
years," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Overall, municipalities issued 1.7 billion in building permits in
May, down 12 percent in the wake of non-residential decline.
</P>
<P>
Permits for single-family dwellings dropped one percent, but
multiple-family units were up 7.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed Amid Riot Before Kenya's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes between the police
and opposition supporters broke out in Nairobi and some other
major Kenyan towns today, claiming at least seven lives and
causing leading business there to an almost complete standstill.
</P>
<P>
Local reports quoted police sources as saying that two men
were killed in Nairobi during the day-long disturbance with four
people in the Nyahururu town and one in Thika. Both towns are
located near the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Among the four victims in Nyahururu, two were crushed to death
when a crowd stampeded as the police moved in, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Kamotho, chief of the ruling Kenya African National
Union (KANU), later strongly condemned the violence caused as
soon as the illegal rallies seeking for constitutional reforms
were broken up by the police in these towns.
</P>
<P>
Violence can only "derail the country from the process of
democracy" and "make the impending general elections impossible,"
he warned in a statement issued this evening.
</P>
<P>
The KANU has already put general elections at the first place,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that this year's fiercest game of "cat and
mouse" was seen today between more than 4,000 policemen and
thousands of demonstrators around main streets of Nairobi, where
most shops had been closed and many barricaded against looters.
</P>
<P>
Along Jogoo Road, nearby the planned rally venue of Kamakunji
Ground, conflicts had lasted for hours between the stone-armed
crowd and the police firing tear-gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
Huge stones were scattered along the road, several cars were
smashed and heavily pounded there. Ambulances marked with red
cross and trucks of police with shields were back and forth while
military carrier planes whistling overhead.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of protesters were said to be severely beaten by the
police during the so-called Saba Saba rally. Saba Saba means the
date of July 7 in Kiswahili. On the day seven years ago, at least
20 people were killed during a similar Nairobi rally.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the opposition leaders announced they would hold the
Saba Saba rallies in some 50 towns in the eastern African
country, disregarding the banning order from the government and
its warning of breaking-up.
</P>
<P>
An estimate of far more than 10,000 police had been deployed
around the scheduled rally site across the country days before
when the government rejected to issue a license to the rallies.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said the rallies were designed to press for
constitutional reforms and direct dialogue between the government
and the opposition before the general elections whose date is yet
to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
However, the KANU lashed out at the rally plan, charging it
was "a plan by the opposition to disrupt normal business and
endanger lives of innocent citizens."
</P>
<P>
The opposition disrupted reading of the budget in parliament
on June 19 and failed to hold two rallies due to police
intervention by force in Nairobi in May.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Vows to Enhance Secularism and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz today reiterated that his government will spare no effort
to safeguard Turkey's secularism and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his government's program in the parliament, Yilmaz
said that the newly established tripartite coalition government
will save the country from the political crisis caused by the
former Welfare Party-led administration.
</P>
<P>
He promised that his government will do its utmost to
reinstate the reputation of the state establishment and to
strengthen the country's constitutional democracy and secularist
system.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, also chairman of the Motherland Party, emphasized
that the new government will try to establish "a culture of
compromise" in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Showing the government's determination to fight
fundamentalism, the program said that the compulsory primary
education will be extended from the current five years to eight
years.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a basic aim (of the government) to train people
equipped with the knowledge and capability to deal with the
information age and assimilate Ataturk (founder of Turkey)'s
principles and reforms," it said.
</P>
<P>
The program also vowed to firmly fight political corruption in
order to create a clean government.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Appeals for Calm, End to Hijackings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, today urged Roman Catholic youths to be
calm and stop car hijackings and burnings in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams called on nationalists "to be
calm, to be disciplined, to refuse to accept the burden of second
class citizenship."
</P>
<P>
He said even he himself saw the hijacking of a truck in west
Belfast on his way to a meeting today.
</P>
<P>
"We just discovered that some young people had hijacked this
lorry and we are trying to return it to its owner," he told local
reporters.
</P>
<P>
A Catholic national violence erupted overnight in Northern
Ireland after the pro-British Protestants were allowed to march
through a Catholic area of Portadown Sunday, with hundreds of
cars, trucks and buses being hijacked and burned.
</P>
<P>
However, despite his appeals, local Catholics, who are strongly
opposed to the parades of the Protestants, were still burning
vehicles only a short distance from where he was speaking,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Across Northern Ireland, Catholic young people used the
well-worn tactic of hijacking cars, setting them on fire and then
stoning or throwing petrol bombs at emergency services and police
and small scale violence was still going on.

<P>
SARAJEVO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Stablization Force
(SFOR) today denied a report by the Bosnian Serb media that troops
in the Muslim-Croat federation are on high alert.
</P>
<P>
According to SFOR spokesman Chris Riley, the Bosnian Serb news
agency, SRNA, Sunday carried a letter presumably written by Serb
army Chief of Staff Pero Colic to the Serb republic's President
Bilijana Plavsic.
</P>

The letter claimed that soldiers had not been released from
service in the military forces of the federation and were
currently in a "heightened state of readiness."
</P>
<P>
"The SFOR constantly monitors the activities of the entity
armies and there are no indicators at present to suggest that the
Federation Army is preparing to take any action against the VRS
(Serb army)," Riley said.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic has been in a political confrontation with her
colleagues in Pale whom she accused of corruption. The letter,
written in the name of Colic, has warned Plavsic of consequences
that the political crisis is bringing on the Serb entity.

<HEADLINE> US Hopes for Peaceful Settlement of Cambodia Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States today called
on both parties concerned in Cambodia's violent conflict to
restrain themselves so that no further violence could be
rekindled.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has been sliding into chaos over the past two days as
troops backing each of the country's two prime ministers battled
with rockets, artillery and small arms in the streets of the
capital of Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Reports said forces loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, who
launched the attack, tried to control the capital while First
Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh was abroad in Paris and
his party had said they would not give up.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters
that the United States was deeply concerned at the violence and
loss of life caused by the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We called on the authorities (of Cambodia) to take decisive
measures, to prevent further violence," Burns said at a regular
briefing. "We urge Cambodia's leaders to resolve their political
difference peacefully, and abide by the principles of the Paris
peace accords."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also called
on the rival factions to settle their differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"What we believe is important is that the various contending
parties solve their problems through peaceful means and not
military means," Albright told a news conference in Madrid where
she is to attend a NATO summit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States was consulting this afternoon with
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries in the
State Department over the situation in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of that meeting is to exchange information with
them and to share our respective assessments over the meaning, the
political meaning of what happened over the weekend," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope that all of us internationally could agree that
we ought to coalesce to argue for an end to the fighting and for
the recommencement of some kind of political cooperation between
the two co-prime ministers and their political parties so that the
people of Cambodia do not have to live through a civil war," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States has not contemplated any kind of
evacuation at the moment of American citizens in Cambodia as the
fighting has subsided over the last 24 hours. But he strongly
recommended that American citizens "defer travel to Cambodia for
the time being."

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Urges Earnest Implementation of Grain Purchase Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- People involved in the nation's
grain production must make concerted efforts to purchase grain at
appropriate prices in a bid to protect the farmers' enthusiasm for
production and maintain the sustained development of agriculture
and the entire national economy.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said this at a national video and
telephone conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
China has seen a bumper summer harvest for the third
consecutive year, which has led to a drop in grain prices in some
places.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji asked localities at all levels to publicize the fact
that the government will purchase the farmers' fixed quotas of
grain at the prices set by the State Council last year and
reaffirmed in a recent circular from the State Council. And the
grain exceeding the fixed quotas will be purchased at protective
prices, which refers to the standard prices set by the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
China has witnessed good harvests for several years running,
and the grain reserve is at an all-time record high. This is an
important guarantee for the sustained, rapid and healthy
development of the national economy, Zhu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He asked the state-run grain systems to purchase grain at
protective prices and never reject, stop or restrict grain
purchase or give farmers IOUs.
</P>
<P>
Talking about how to increase the farmers' incomes and protect
their interests, Zhu said that the grain growing structure should
be rationally adjusted according to the market demand.

<HEADLINE> IGAD Summit Urges End on Sudan, Somalia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today called for end to conflicts in Sudan and Somalia while
opening a two-day regional summit attended by leaders from six
eastern and northeastern African countries.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the sixth Inter-Governmental Authority
on Development (IGAD) summit is Sudan's crisis and its thorny
ties with Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda, especially the fate of
114 Sudanese prisoners of war held by Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The summit is attended by President Moi, his counterparts Omar
el-Bashir of Sudan, Hassan Aptidon of Djibouti and Issaias
Afeworki of Eritrea, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and
Ugandan First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign
Affairs Eriya Kategaya.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) leader John
Garang arrived here Monday before the summit. He said he has come
only for consultations and would not attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
SPLA has fought in southern Sudan since 1983 for greater
autonomy of the Christian south from the Moslem north and now is
allied with armed opposition groups in northern Sudan with
battles continuing in the north as well as in the south.
</P>
<P>
"We must bring the escalation of the conflict in eastern and
northern Sudan to the forefront and find a quick solution by
urging all parties in the conflict to pursue peace," urged Moi,
who is also the IGAD chairman, in his opening speech.
</P>
<P>
"In order to break the impasse, the talks must be resumed by
all parties in the conflict so that a lasting solution can be
found," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD held two high-level meetings in 1994 on the crisis in
Sudan but the talks were deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has accused for a long time its
fellow-IGAD members Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda of sending
troops over the border to fight alongside rebels.
</P>
<P>
In response, Uganda accuses Sudan of providing havens and
support for a northern Ugandan rebel group, the Lord's Resistance
Army (LRA), which has been fighting for 10 years in a bid to
topple Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Moi today also called for peace and stability restored in
Somalia and expressed regret that "leaders in Somalia have not
seen it fit to take seriously the suffering of the people,
particularly women and children."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Somali leaders will realize that the primary
responsibility for finding a negotiated settlement is in their
own hands and that they must put their heads together to stop the
suffering of their people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's chair is vacant at the seven-member IGAD summit as
usual because it has not had a central government since 1991 when
clan leaders combined to oust former leader Mohamed Siad Barre
and then brought the Horn of African nation into a war-torn
state.
</P>
<P>
IGAD was set up in 1986 for enhancing cooperation on
anti-drought and economic development among the member countries.
Regional political affairs have been on its agenda since 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"We all have an obligation to support a strong IGAD in order
to move toward the realization of the African Economic
Community," Moi added when presiding over today's summit.

NEW YORK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Justice Department of the
United States approved Monday British Telecom's acquisition of the
MCI Communication Corporation of the United States, thus clearing
a major regulatory hurdle for the acquisition of MCI, the nation's
second-largest long-distance telephone company only next to AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
The London-based British Telecom and MCI Communications of
Washington announced their merger plan in November last year. In
May this year, the European Union cleared the deal valued at 22
billion U.S. dollars, subject to conditions to protect
competition.
</P>
<P>
The two telecommunication giants expressed confident that the
merger could be completed by fall this year, according to a report

</P>
<P>
The companies said that their proposed merger would benefit
consumers and businesses, creating competition that would bring
down phone rates on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
The combined company would rank second only to AT&AMP;T as a
long-distance carrier worldwide. It would have annual revenue of
about 43 billion U.S. dollars and business and residential
customers in 72 countries.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees Record Mergers This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadian companies are on track for
a record year of mergers and acquisitions, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of transactions in Canada increased 21 percent to
628 in the first half of this year from 521 in the same period of
last year, according to a survey by the Toronto-based Crosbie &AMP;
Co. Inc..
</P>
<P>
Canadian businesses are on target to break last year's record
number of deals of 1,185 as well as the 1995 record for the total
annual value of transactions of 56 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To the end of June, the combined value of all mergers and
acquisitions was 32.7 billion dollars, up from 25.2 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very buoyant environment from the point of view of
doing transactions," Alan Crosbie, managing partner of the
company, was quoted as saying by the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I just don't see anything that is going to cause this to
change," he said.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates, a strong economy and a move toward
globalization are the key reasons for the increased activity, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest deals so far this year include the 3.2 billion
dollars merger of Abitibi-Price Inc. and Stone Consolidated Corp.
and the 1.7 billion bid for London Insurance Group Inc. by Royal
Bank of Canada.

</P>
<P>
The drop is the steepest slide in the past three years,

"Not only are these numbers promising from a real estate

<HEADLINE> Japan Announces New Budget Request Rules for Fiscal 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government today rolled
out new rules to cut budgetary spending and move toward restoring
the nation's deficit-ridden state finances by the target year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Effective from fiscal year 1998, the guidelines for budgetary
requests will cap government ministries and agencies' expenditure
growth according to the policy sectors they are involved.
</P>
<P>
They will replace the current system under which the cabinet
decides limits on budgetary growth for each ministry and agency, a
Kyodo News report quoted Finance Ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, general account expenditures for fiscal
1998 starting next April 1 will be cut by 240 billion yen (2.1
billion U.S. dollars), or 0.5 percent off the fiscal 1997 level,
to about 43,560 billion yen (385.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
To improve the efficiency of fund allocation, the system sets
aside a special outlay of 550 billion yen (4.9 billion dollars)
for areas deemed important for economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The measures, which were recommended in June by the Conference
on Fiscal Structural Reform, a forum headed by Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, were approved at a cabinet meeting this morning.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new system sets quantitative reduction targets
on major spending ranging from public works to official
development assistance (ODA) for foreign recipients.
</P>
<P>
Outlays for Japan's ODA program in fiscal 1998 will be cut by
10 percent or 110 billion yen (970 million dollars) from the
previous year, the Finance Ministry officials said.

<HEADLINE> Brisk Market for Hydroplanes South of Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Light-duty hydroplane transport has
a brisk market potential in the southeastern part of China, an
area rich in water resources, according to a civil aviation expert.
</P>
<P>
The area, south of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
river, has not enough land airports, while it would take up too
much arable land to build a new airport, said Pan Jichun, an
engineer with the Changzhou Aircraft Manufacturer, in east China's
Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
A small airport of 20 ha would cause the loss of more than 80
tons of grain annually, he said, adding that in China each airport
has to serve an area of 90,000 sq km on average, 18 times the
world average.
</P>
<P>
China's major freshwater lakes are all located on the middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze, including Taihu, Hongze and
Poyang lakes. In addition, the area has a number of large
reservoirs. "The conditions here are very beneficial for
developing hydroplane transport," said Pan.
</P>
<P>
A hydroplane port needs a special water surface of only 1,000 m
long and 65 m wide, according to him.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces can both introduce
60 to 70 hydroplanes to cater to the growing numbers of business
travelers and tourists.
</P>
<P>
While speeding up research and development of China's own
hydroplanes, foreign hydroplanes can be introduced to the Yangtze
area first, Pan said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM: Cabinet Shifted to Improve Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's limited cabinet reshuffle
today is aimed at boosting efficiency in the government, said
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
"The present stage requires speed and decisiveness in
performance in various domains of production and services,"
Ganzouri told reporters after the swearing-in of the ten new
ministers.
</P>
<P>
In the shake-up, some ministries were split up to create new
ones like ministries of environment and higher education,
according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"Some changes were made to take the burden off some big
ministries such as education... while environment is coming up as
another important concern," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the new appointees that took the constitutional oath
before President Hosni Mubarak at the presidency headquarters,
four of them are first timers in the cabinet which has remained
intact since Ganzouri took office in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mufeed Shihab, rector of Cairo University, was assigned the
post of minister of higher education and minister of state for
scientific research affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abdel Halim Abu Zeid, chairman of the Water Resources
Conservation Research Center, will head the Ministry of Public
Works and Water Resources to replace the late minister Abdel-Hadi
Radi who died last November.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Ambassadress to Japan Mervat el-Talawi takes charge of
the Ministry of Insurances and Social Affairs. And Nadia Riyad
Makram, who was in charge of women and development affairs at the
UN Development Program, was chosen for environment minister.
</P>
<P>
The three drop-outs from the 32-member cabinet, all women
including the economy minister, were either criticized for
mismanagement and inefficiency or simply accused of staying in the
cabinet for too long.
</P>
<P>
Three key ministers -- Defense Minister Mohamed Hussein
Tantawi, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Interior Minister Hassan
el-Alfy -- retain their posts.
</P>
<P>
The appointments were made this morning during a session
between Ganzouri and these new appointees.
</P>

The cabinet reshuffle is to be followed by a governorship
shake-up in a drive to speed up the country's economic
development, according to local press.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 (xinhua) -- The seven-member Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today urged rival groups in
Cambodia to stop fighting immediately and resolve their
differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN calls for an immediate ceasefire," Malaysian Foreign
Minister and Chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi said today in a statement on behalf of the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that ASEAN was dismayed and deeply regretted the
unfortunate turn of events in Cambodia resulting in the loss of
innocent lives of both Cambodian citizens and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, called on Cambodia's two
co-prime ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen to resolve
their differences peacefully, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Cambodian people have suffered from conflict for the past
two decades. It would be tragic for the conflict to re-ignite in
the country that has long suffered from war," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN also urged the Government of Cambodia to take immediate
steps to ensure the safety of foreign nationals and provide
protection for their properties in that country.
</P>

He said ASEAN would monitor the situation in Cambodia and
convene a special meeting of ASEAN Foreign Ministers in Kuala
Lumpur on Thursday to review the situation in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said today in Jakarta
that the ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting on Thursday in Kuala
Lumpur is expected to come up with a proposal on how to settle the
conflict in Cambodia peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a proposal earlier for a senior officials
meeting to discuss the Cambodian crisis but Indonesia suggested to
make the meeting a ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh said Hun
Sen has taken control of the capital during weekend fighting

<HEADLINE> Uganda Peace-Keepers to be Deployed on OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's peace-keeping detachment,
to be trained by U.S. Green Beret soldiers, will be deployed once
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) permits, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
Amama Mbabazi, the State Minister for Defense, told ''The
Monitor'' paper here Monday, what attracted the Uganda army in
U.S. Green Beret Unit training is its building capacity.
</P>
<P>
But deployment of the detachment must be consulted with the
OAU, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
''Building capacity is one thing and deploying that force is
another,'' Mbabazi told the newspaper. ''We can train and develop
capacity, when it comes to deploying that force, we have to get
the mandate from the OAU,'' said the official.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a high-ranking official stated his
point of view on the matter.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said some 60 U.S. Green Beret soldiers will
arrive within a week to train an 800-men battalion for two
months.
</P>
<P>
The object of the training is to create rapidly deployable
peace-keeping troops of eight to 10 battalions under the auspices
of the United Nations and the OAU. They would be sent to such hot
spots in Africa as Congo (Brazzaville) to help maintain peace
there.
</P>
<P>
U.S. soldiers will train army men from Senegal, Tunisia,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali and Malawi later this year under the same
plan.

<HEADLINE> France Favors International Mobilization Over Cambodian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it favors an
international mobilization to pressure the conflicting sides of
Cambodia to resume dialogue over the present crisis in their
country.
</P>
<P>
"Faced with the fullness of the crisis, the mobilization of the
international community is necessary," said a spokesman of the
French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
France invites different parties in Cambodia to show moderation
and to resume as soon as possible dialogue aimed at going out of
the present crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
This message was delivered by the Assistant General Secretary
of the French Foreign Ministry, Claude Martin, to Cambodia's First
Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh during their meeting in the
latter's residence in Aix-en-Provence, southeast France, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
France has also expressed to Cambodia's Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen its wish for a halt of hostilities, the resumption without
delay of the normal functioning of government institutions, and
the respect for the constitutional principles adopted by Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The French government Monday urged a "return of the law" in
Cambodia, after troops loyal to Hun Sen ousted the troops of
Ranariddh from Phnom Penh on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
France has called on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) to "use their influence upon different sides of Cambodia"
to seek an end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN countries, which include Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei, today expressed
regret over the violence that took place in Cambodia over the past
several days and called for an immediate ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Report: Aid Insufficient to Meet Iraq's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A report by the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNCICEF) has said aid supplies fall short of
meeting Iraq's actual needs and warned of deteriorating health
status in Iraq, local newspaper the Baghdad Observer reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report released last week by UNICEF's Executive Council's
12th ordinary session said that aid supplies offered by the
U.N. agency to Iraq are unsufficient even if they are offered at
appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF has funded most of the children's health programs
in Iraq since the Gulf War in 1991. But it cut its activities in
the country after the Iraqi-U.N. "oil-for-food" deal came into
force last December.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Iraq can sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over six months on a renewable basis for the purchase of
humanitarian goods urgently needed in the country, which has
been under harsh U.N.-imposed sanctions for nearly seven years
after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
From its oil revenues, Iraq has earmarked 210 million dollars
for medical supplies and another 10 million dollars for health
repairs. However, only a small part of the medical supplies
bought by Iraq under the "oil-for-food" deal has arrived the
country up till now.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the U.N. agency was accused of being
indifferent to Iraq's needs which are submitted by Iraq's Health
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In March, the UNICEF and Iraq's Health Ministry launched a
country-wide campaign to immunize more than 3 million Iraqi
children against polio.
</P>
<P>
Figures published by the Iraqi Health Ministry indicated that
U.N. sanctions have made the death toll of the Iraqis ever year
rise from about 30,000 before 1991 to 140,000 now.
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization (WHO) warned earlier that Iraq's
health system is close to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Government drug warehouses and pharmacies have few stocks of
medicines and medical supplies, WHO said.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry
today refuted a Turkmen protest against the Russian-Azerbaijani
contract on the Kyapaz oil field in the Caspina Sea, reported the
Interfax News Service.
</P>
<P>
"Such statements cannot have any influence on the
Russian-Azerbaijani agreement signed in Moscow," Azerbaijani
Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov.
</P>
<P>
Gasanov said that his country was always ready to give a
positive response to constructive Turkmen proposals for
cooperation in the development of offshore oil fields.
</P>
<P>
These proposals remain valid, he continued, and Azerbaijan
"intends to discuss any beneficial proposals with fraternal
Turkmenistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-Azerbaijani agreement on joint development of the
Kyapaz oil field was signed on Friday during Azerbaijani President
Geidar Aliyev's visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen Foreign Ministry lodged a protest Saturday over the
the contract signed between the Kyapaz offshore field by Russia's
Lukoil and Rosneft oil companies and the State Oil Company of the
Azerbaijani Republic (SOCAR).
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan demanded categorically that this agreement be
annulled in order to avoid consequences for which Turkmenistan
"will bear no responsibility."
</P>
<P>
"Turkmenistan could only welcome such cooperation if the
Serdar field (the former promezhutochnoye field) which belongs to
Turkmenistan and is referred to in the agreement as Kyapaz had not
been included in the zone of joint development operations (between
the Russian and Azerbaijani companies)," the Turkmen ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian-Azerbaijani agreement, SOCAR will have a 50
percent stake in the project, Lukoil a 30 percent stake and
Rosneft a 20 percent stake.

"But the lack of a mediator is not our problem here," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar also said the government must have misread the message
and erroneously believed that the solution to the impasse is a
broker.
</P>
<P>
Ramos today ordered government troops in Mindanao to cease from
conducting offensive actions against the MILF in order to allow
government negotiators to talk with rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line here is sincerity. Both sides must be
sincere," Jaafar noted.
</P>
<P>
"The MILF is sincere. The government, it appears, is not," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Asked what would bring the MILF back to the negotiating table,
Jaafar said the government must stop the "massive and all-out
military operations against our forces here in Central Mindanao
first."

<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia expects 5.3 billion U.S.
dollars in new foreign loans this year from the Consultative Group
on Indonesia (CGI) despite a possible reduction in aid from Japan,
a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Official news agency Antara today quoted Coordinating Minister
for Economy and Finance Saleh Afiff as saying that Indonesia
expected the CGI, which will hold its annual meeting in Tokyo
early next week, to give at least the same amount as last year.

The CGI committed 5.26 billion U.S. dollars in new loans and
grants last year, compared to 5.358 billion the year before.
</P>
<P>
Afiff said that Japan -- CGI's largest creditor -- was facing
financial problems which had forced it to reduce its foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Japan's foreign aid to Indonesia through the CGI was 1.917
billion dollars last year or 36 percent of the total, as compared
to 2.14 billion dollars or 40 percent of the total in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The CGI groups the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, Britain, Italy, Japan, Germany, Canada, South
Korea, Norway, France, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and

KHARTOUM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan
Ahmed al-Bashir left here today for Kenya, heading the Sudanese
delegation for the summit of Inter-Governmental Authority on
Drought and Development (IGADD).

The IGADD organization groups Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia
Eritrea, Djibouti and Somali.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mustafa Osman
Ismail announced that the Sudanese delegation would brief the

Khartoum peace agreement signed last April between the Sudanese
government and two groups of the rebel movement in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
John Garang, leader of the mainstream rebel group in southern
Sudan, is expected to participate in the IGADD summit, which is
due to discuss the issue of achieving peace in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources here, there has been a

<HEADLINE> Increase in Autumn Grain Production Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A national conference on agriculture
has urged all departments in charge of agricultural production to
spare no efforts to ensure another bumper harvest of autumn grain.
</P>
<P>
The conference, held in Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, and
attended by Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang and heads of
provincial-level departments of agriculture, asked the departments
to try their best to keep autumn grain production at the same
level of last year.
</P>
<P>
The officials warned of possible unfavorable weather conditions
for autumn grain production, even though a bumper summer grain
harvest has been registered in most parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Water-saving technology and dry-land farming techniques should
be widely adopted in north China, and the fine strains of grain
should be developed nationwide in order to improve the Chinese
people's diet, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The conference urged the departments to attach special
importance to extending the term of farmers' land-use contracts
for another 30 years.
</P>
<P>
China started to carry out the "household contract
responsibility system" in rural areas in 1979. Under this system
farmers obtain farmland through land-use contracts and have the
freedom to grow various kinds of crops according to market demand.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the system is still a fundamental policy in
rural China, and should be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
The conference closed today.

SHENYANG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Liaoning Province has been
holding activities recently for the 60th anniversary of the
outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan on July 7, 1937.
</P>
<P>
Many people have visited memorials and museums in the
provincial capital, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Museum for the September 18 Incident, an important
national patriotic education center, has had about 900,000
visitors in the past six years, and mementos of the "Pingding
Mountain Massacre" in Fushun have become an important way to help
people think about the past, according to the official.
</P>

Recently, various meetings have been held to commemorate events
in Liaoning, the first province in China to be captured by
Japanese troops and the first to rise in resistance, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cease-fire Monitors Call for Self-Restraint by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A five-nation group monitoring a
cease-fire in south Lebanon today called on Israeli occupation
forces and Lebanese guerrilla of Hezbollah, which are involved in
a war of friction in south Lebanon, to maintain self-refrainment.
</P>
<P>
However, the international panel failed to blame either side
for the escalation of the Arab-Israeli conflict on the last
active battlefront in the past few days, in which nearly a dozen
of Lebanese civilians were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which comprises the United States, Israel,
France, Syria and Lebanon, currently headed by U.S. diplomat
David Greenly, started a meeting on Monday morning to discuss two
complaints filed by the Lebanese government and the other two
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued following their meeting in the south
Lebanese border town of Naqoura, representatives from the five
nations, also urged the fighting sides to totally comply with
the cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel
in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese complaints lodged on July 3 and July 7 said
Israeli artillery intentionally targeted civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued this morning, the cease-fire monitoring
committee said it "accepted as factual" that the Israeli
shelling had caused injuries.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese delegate stated that the firing was far from
the area of military conflict ... and that Israeli targeting of
civilians has become routine," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Israeli delegate claimed that the
bombardment "was conducted in self-defense", according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Israeli complaints filed on July 3 and July 6,
the committee also "accepted as factual" that at least one 120mm
mortar and one 122mm Katyusha rocket had impacted on Israel. It
noted that neither attacks caused injuries.
</P>
<P>
This was the 13th meeting of the committee since this
year. Many Lebanese have doubted about the panel's effectiveness
in monitoring the cease-fire in light of the repeated
low-profile statements it has issued since its establishment in
August 1996 under the "April understanding."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army sources said that two Katyusha rockets hit
northern Israel on Sunday night after they were apparently
targeted on the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Israeli-client militia, South Lebanon Army
(SLA), claimed that seven rockets landed in Israel on the
outskirts of the coastal town of Nahayiey.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, confirmed today
that two of its fighters were killed Monday in action against
Israeli forces and the SLA.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by Hezbollah in Beirut identified the two
members as Mohsen Abdullah Fneigh and Mahmoud Hussein Salman, but
it did not specify. "They were martyred when performing their
holy struggle duties on July 7," it said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO leaders today approved
invitations to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join the
alliance, Spanish news agency EFE quoted NATO sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The United States, with the backing of some European allies,
insisted that the first wave of eastward expansion should be
limited to the three countries.
</P>
<P>
But France, Italy and other allies wanted invitation also
extended to Romania and Slovenia, in an effort to avoid too heavy
a shift in NATO's future orientation toward Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the NATO leaders will announce the
invitation list later today at their summit meeting in the Spanish
capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met here
today with overseas representatives participating in the ongoing
Transcultural Seminar on Economic Development and International
Exchanges in the Asia-Pacific Region Into the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed the politicians, entrepreneurs and academic
personnel from Japan, the United States, Canada and Germany to
participate in the seminar and hoped that it would make positive
contributions to enhancing mutual understanding and promoting
friendly cooperation among Asia-Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
Mankind is at a crucial point in moving toward another century,
Li said. He stressed that all countries should give answers to
such challenges and issues as how to establish a stable and
peaceful international environment, how to make sure that all
countries can enjoy equal rights in international affairs, how to
establish a new type of international economic order featuring
mutual benefit, complementarity and common development, how to
jointly abide by the principles of mutual non-interference in
international affairs and respect for the wishes of the people of
all countries in choosing their own development road in line with
their own conditions, and how to manage effective international
cooperation to deal with the issues of environmental protection
and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the East and Northeast Asian regions should
maintain their momentum of economic growth while adapting
themselves to the rapid development of science and technology, Li
noted.
</P>
<P>
As a country of the Asian-Pacific region, China pursues its
independent foreign policy of peace and has always attached
importance to its exchanges and cooperation with Asian-Pacific
countries, devoting itself wholeheartedly to both regional and
global peace and stability, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Teruyuki Akema, chairman of the Japanese Association for the
Communication of Transcultural Studies, said, on behalf of the
overseas participants at the seminar, that he fully agreed with
what Premier Li said. All countries should take new steps to greet
the 21st century, he added. The seminar, focusing on the prospects
in the 21st century, bears important significance as it is being
held in China, which is a country playing an extremely important
role in the region and in the world as a whole, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Calls on International Community to Condemn Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh today called on the international community to
condemn the "coup d'etat" staged by Hun Sen, the country's second
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference in Paris today, Ranariddh called on
the international community, the United Nations, the signing
countries of the 1991 Paris peace agreements on Cambodia, the
European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) "never to recognize a regime resulting from a coup d'etat."
</P>
<P>
"I demand all countries to condemn the criminal and bloody coup
d'etat, and to insisit that any solution should conform to the
Paris agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would go to Washington and New York on Wednesday to
meet with U.S. officials and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
while Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung Huot will go to ASEAN
countries to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said that resistance is being organized in the
western part of Cambodia under the control of royalist forces, and
that he keeps telephone contact with his generals in the field.
</P>
<P>
He also said he himself would go back to Cambodia to head
the resistance.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a resistance inside the country and the chief
of the resistance should be inside the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is reportedly going on in Siem Reap, 314 kilometers
north of the capital Phnom Penh and near the 12th century
historical site of Angkor Temples, between the royalist forces and
the troops of Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh said that he would go to Thailand first, and that his
return to Cambodia "would be conditioned by the attitude of
Thailand, which seems to adopt an attitude of neutrality."
</P>
<P>
He denied that he would establish a military alliance with the
Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who have for their part called for a
people's uprising against Hun Sen.

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches T-72 Tank Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today inaugurated the first phase of T-72 tank plant
in Dorroud, Lorestan province, west Iran, according to a Radio
report.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that some 60 Iranian
industrial units are supplying the T-72 factory, which is located
some 420 kilometers southeast of the capital city of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention when and where the T-72
tank plant was imported. Specialists believe the plant was brought
in from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The tank, massively used by Iran's long-standing foe Iraq in
their eight-year war (1980-88), was then one of the most advanced
in the world.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony today, Rafsanjani said that the tank production
line served as a significant step toward technology transfer and
strengthening of engineering design of Iran.
</P>
<P>
"This great service, which saves the country more than 1
billion dollar in hard currency, will have great economic
blessings for Iran," the Iranian president was quoted by the
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
He praised Iran's defense industry for its creativity, adding
that the manufacturing of T-72 tanks was among the greatest
dreams of the Iranian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"The committed technicians of the defense industry are striving
to add another proud chapter to their history," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the official news agency IRNA kept silent over the
inauguration of the T-72 plant.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Calls for Immediate Ceasefire in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 (xinhua) -- The seven-member Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today urged rival groups in
Cambodia to stop fighting immediately and resolve their
differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN calls for an immediate ceasefire," Malaysian Foreign
Minister and Chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi said today in a statement on behalf of the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that ASEAN was dismayed and deeply regretted the
unfortunate turn of events in Cambodia resulting in the loss of
innocent lives of both Cambodian citizens and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, called on Cambodia's two
co-prime ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen to resolve
their differences peacefully, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Cambodian people have suffered from conflict for the past
two decades. It would be tragic for the conflict to re-ignite in
the country that has long suffered from war," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN also urged the Government of Cambodia to take immediate
steps to ensure the safety of foreign nationals and provide
protection for their properties in that country.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN would monitor the situation in Cambodia and
convene a special meeting of ASEAN Foreign Ministers in Kuala
Lumpur on Thursday to review the situation in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh said Hun
Sen has taken control of the capital during weekend fighting
against supporters of Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Phnom Penh was reported to have calmed down.

<HEADLINE> HK Property Prices Be Curbed: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Local experts suggested that the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government curb
soaring property prices in an effort to improve the business
environment and increase the competitiveness of Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
Extremely high property prices may add the operational cost of
companies and increase inflation, experts attending a symposium on
the direction of the HKSAR's economic and social development, Wen
Wei Po reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some multi-national companies which have based their regional
headquarters here might be forced to move out if the rental prices
for office buildings were kept at a high level, they warned.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that a huge gap between supply and demand
should be blamed for the ever rising real estate prices, and they
suggested that the HKSAR government increase the supply of land.
</P>
<P>
As the experts put it, promotion of high-tech industries and a
balanced development of the manufacturing and service sectors
would also increase the competitiveness of Hong Kong economy with
a perspective into the next century.

Malaysian Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim asked the Foreign
Ministry today to study with its ASEAN counterparts the
possibility of a change in ASEAN's stand on admitting Cambodia
into the regional grouping.
</P>

Anwar said although ASEAN is sticking to the original schedule
for Cambodia's admission, Malaysia has to study the latest
development in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN foreign ministers decided in Kuala Lumpur on May 31
to admit Cambodia, along with Laos and Myanmar, into the regional
grouping during the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting scheduled for
July 24-25.

<P>
Anwar said Monday that Cambodia would definitely be accepted
into ASEAN at the end of the month together with Laos and Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's New Ministers Take Oath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's new ministers, having
survived the limited cabinet reshuffle, took the constitutional
oath before President Hosni Mubarak at the presidency headquarters
today.
</P>
<P>
Ten newly-appointed ministers were sworn in at the ceremony,
attended by Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and Chief of the
Presidential Cabinet Zakaria Azmi.
</P>
<P>
Four of them are new comers in the one-and-half-year-old
cabinet which has remained intact since Ganzouri took office in
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mufeed Shihab, Rector of Cairo University, was assigned the
post of minister of higher education and minister of state for
scientific research affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abdel Halim Abu Zeid, chairman of the Water Resources
Conservation Research Center, will head the Ministry of Public
Works and Water Resources to replace the late Abdel-Hadi Radi who
died last November.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Ambassadress to Japan Mervat el-Talawi takes charge of
the Ministry of Insurances and Social Affairs, and Nadia Riyad
Makram, who was in charge of Women and Development at the U.N.
Development Program, took the post of minister of environment
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members with the key portfolios -- Defense Minister
Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Interior
Minister Hassan el-Alfy -- remain in their jobs. The personnel
shift will take in two women, one short of the original cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Others that assumed new ministerial portfolios and took the
constitutional oath are old faces.
</P>
<P>
Atef Ebeid, who currently takes charge of the Public Sector as
well as Administrative Development and Environment, was nominated
minister of public enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Youssef Boutros-Ghali, minister of state at the Cabinet, who
cut short his week-long trip to London and returned home this
morning, was assigned the heavy-weight economic portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Zafer al-Beshry, steering the Ministry of Planning at the
moment, becomes the minister of State for planning and
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abu-Amer, the current Minister for People's Assembly
and Shura Council Affairs, turns out to be the new minister of
state for administrative development.
</P>
<P>
While Mahmoud Sherif, Minister of Local Government, was trusted
to lead the newly-installed Ministry of Rural Development, Hussein
Kamel Bahaa Eddine managed to keep the portfolio of education.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak later held a meeting with the ministerial body. Absent
from the meeting were Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif,
Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Goweili, and Minister of Finance
Mohi Eddin el-Gharib, who are all abroad.
</P>
<P>
The nominations were made this morning during a consultation
session held by Ganzouri with these new appointees.
</P>
<P>
Rumors about injecting new blood to the one-year-old cabinet
have been rife since the beginning of this year. No new members
have joined the 32-member cabinet since Ganzouri took office in
January 1996.

<HEADLINE> HK Press Hails SAR's External Affairs Functions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Two of Hong Kong's major
newspapers published commentaries today, hailing the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government's being
authorized by the Central People's Government to handle certain
external affairs on its own.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner of the country's Foreign Ministry in the
HKSAR, Ma Yuzhen, met with Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
yesterday and passed on to Tung a letter from Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen which authorizes the HKSAR
Government to negotiate bilateral agreements with concerned
countries in five fields.
</P>
<P>
The authorization demonstrated once again the sincerity and
determination of the Central People's Government in implementing
the Basic Law, a commentary carried by Wen Wei Po said.
</P>
<P>
Article 13 of the Basic Law stipulates that the Central
People's Government shall be responsible for the foreign affairs
relating to the HKSAR; the Chinese Foreign Ministry shall
establish an office in Hong Kong to deal with foreign affairs; the
Central People's Government authorizes the HKSAR to conduct
relevant external affairs on its own in accordance with this Law,
said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The authorization will benefit Hong Kong's high degree of
autonomy and its economic development and social stability, and
will also help safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of
the Hong Kong people, the commentary concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily said that the meeting between Ma
and Tung marked the formal establishment of working relationship
between the Office of Commissioner and the HKSAR Government.
</P>
<P>
Ma described the relationship as that of mutual respect and
close cooperation during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Upon the inauguration of the HKSAR Government, the Central
People's Government authorized the HKSAR Government to negotiate
bilateral agreements with concerned countries on air service
transit, investment promotion and protection, transfer of fugitive
offenders, transfer of sentenced persons and mutual legal
assistance in criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
This fully reflected the trust of the Central People's
Government in the HKSAR Government, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
That the Office of Commissioner and the HKSAR Government make
good cooperation on foreign affairs of the HKSAR will accumulate
experience for the handling of foreign affairs under "one country,
two systems," and the experience is very significant to the final
realization of reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao carried a commentary today, titled "Sooner or
Later, Taiwan Will Embark on the Road of 'One Country, Two
Systems'."
</P>
<P>
The solution of the Hong Kong problem with the concept of "one
country, two systems" is very smooth and perfect, and it signifies
a vital step toward reunification of the motherland, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The principle of "one country, two systems" is applicable in
Hong Kong and, certainly, it will be applicable in Taiwan, it
noted, adding whether the Taiwan authorities are willing or not,
Taiwan will sooner or later take the road.
</P>
<P>
The smooth handover of Hong Kong demonstrates that the
principle respects both history and reality, gives good
consideration to the interests of all sides, and is the best way
to solve problems left by history, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It is foreseeable that the "one country, two systems" policy
will soon show its vitality in Hong Kong, setting a good example
for Taiwan, it added.

Special traffic arrangements would be made to avoid unnecessary

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Halt of Offensive Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today ordered
government troops to cease from conducting offensives against
Muslim rebels in order to save the endangered peace process in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Aguirre, head of the Presidential Management Staff,
said that President Ramos, through Defense Secretary Renato de
Villa, had directed the troops to hold on to their positions
instead of taking offensive actions.
</P>
<P>
But Aguirre said the military will also be forced to move if
the civilian population is threatened by the rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
He said government negotiating panel chairman Fortunato Abat
and Governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao Nur
Misuari are expected to establish contacts with MILF leaders for
the resumption of the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said Misuari has been authorized to talk with MILF
leader Hashim Salamat to bring back the MILF to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
The MILF pulled out of the sixth round of low-level peace talks
with the government late last month after the military seized Camp
Rajah Muda, the second largest MILF headquarters in central
Mindanao, after two weeks of fierce offensives.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a militant Muslim group which has sought to
establish an independent Islamic state in Mindanao. The MILF and
Manila started peace talks in January this year, but the talks
have been on-and-off for sporadic fightings between the two sides.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The stalemate in Chittagong port came
to an end this afternoon as rival unions agreed to submit their
dispute to arbitration by the Shipping Ministry, said official
news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS).
</P>
<P>
The six-day deadlock came to an end following a fruitful
meeting between Deputy Minister for Shipping Nath Shambu and
representatives of concerned organizations, including the Merchant
Workers' Union and the Coaster Hatch Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 merchant workers started the strike Thursday
afternoon in protest against engagement of hatch workers in
lighterage of cargo from ships anchored at the outer anchorage,
claiming they were supposed to that job.
</P>
<P>
The hatch workers, however, said that they were driven out from
their work by the merchant workers by force in 1986 and they were
struggling for the last few years to get back their right.
</P>
<P>
It was unanimously decided at the meeting that the Ministry of
Shipping will take decision regarding this dispute in the next 10
to 15 days while workers will maintain a status quo till the
decision comes from the ministry, the BSS reported.
</P>
<P>
Port officials said that the striking workers have already
resumed their duties and full-length operation activities are
going on.
</P>
<P>
The Strike has forced over 30 ships including nine ships at the
outer anchorage stranded, creating congestion in this country's
commercial lifeline.

<HEADLINE> Petition for Charter Changes Dismissed in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Charter changes advocates in the
Philippines today received another heavy blow after the seven
members of the Commission on Elections unanimously voted against a
petition calling for Constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
A 14-page resolution signed by the seven commissioners said
that, in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court, the
Commission dismissed at bench the petition filed on June 23 by the
People's Initiative for Reform, Modernization and Action (PIRMA).
</P>
<P>
The resolution said no hearing would be scheduled to determine
the sufficiency of the petition, and the commission would not
order its election officers to verify the 5.5 million signatures
the PIRMA submitted to the Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission also asked the PIRMA to retrieve all the files
and the signatures within five days, saying that it would not
assume responsibility for the safe keeping of these files upon the
expiration of the period granted.
</P>
<P>
The country's Supreme Court has ruled for the second time
against charter changes that would lift the term limits for
President Fidel Ramos and other incumbent officials and
congressmen.
</P>
<P>
But advocates of charter changes are not reconciled to defeat.
After the court made its decision, the PIRMA filed its petition
which called for a plebiscite to change the Charter.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos said he would step down as his term ends next
June. But meanwhile, he admitted that he was facing mounting
pressure from supporters who favor him staying in power.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Calls for Faster Asia-Europe Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto has
called on the business communities in Asia and Europe to foster a
sincere and mutually beneficial partnership.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto made the remarks here today when he opened the first
Asia-Europe Business Conference. Some 450 representatives from 25
countries, namely 15 European Union members and seven ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) as well as China, Japan
and South Korea, are attending the three-day conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting, the business communities of
the two continents will have a better mutual understanding for the
creation of a conducive environment for the intensified economic
and business relations among them.
</P>
<P>
"We are all preparing to enter a new era, characterized
primarily by the very rapid globalization process," he said.
</P>
<P>
To realize the people's well-being, he noted, it is a
prerequisite that there must be a partnership between the
government and private sector. This applies everywhere, whether in
the West or in the East, in the North or in the South.
</P>
<P>
The conference is a follow-up activity of the decision of the
first informal Asian-European Leaders Meeting (ASEM I ) in Bangkok
in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM agreed to expand the opportunities for economic and
business cooperation through greater flow of investment, experts
and technology and generate faster two-way trade and investment
flows based on common commitment to market economy, open
multilateral trade system, non-discriminative liberalization and
open regionalism.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to discuss four issues, namely
developing small and medium size enterprises including supporting
industries; improving trade and investment facilitation and
infrastructure; future direction of Asia-Europe business
relationship and Asia-Europe business matchmaking for the common
good.
</P>
<P>
Some ministers from the Indonesian government and famous
businessmen will make speeches on economic cooperation between the
two continents.
</P>
<P>
The results of the meeting will be reported to the economic
ministers meeting to be held late September this year in Makuhari,
Japan and the second ASEM leaders meeting in London in Spring next
year.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto hoped the conference will become a forum for the
economic and business players from Asia and Europe to get in touch
with each other and foster a mutually beneficial cooperation
between the two important regions.

<HEADLINE> Ten Kenyans Died in Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The death toll reached 10 during
violent confrontations between the police and opposition
supporters in Kenya on monday, a local report said today.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 killed were one student and a policeman.
</P>
<P>
Scores of people, including three opposition parliament
members, were seriously injured in the capital Nairobi, where
most shops were closed on the day and many barricaded against
looters.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has voiced strong condemnation on the
nationwide disturbance.
</P>
<P>
"The government will deal firmly with those found to be
inciting others to violence, looting or destruction of property,"
warned a government statement issued Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"Changes will always come and go but a culture of violence and
lawlessness should not be nurtured in our nation as it may easily
take root and destroy our stability, undermine security and all
our national achievements and aspirations," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Joseph Kamotho, Secretary General of the Ruling Kenya
African National Union (KANU), said the tragedy is "a conspiracy
by the opposition to seize political power by force," charging the
opposition with attempting to unleash chaos so as to make the
general election impossible.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders and some church groups had called the
so-called Saba Saba (July 7 in Swahili) rallies in some 50 towns
in the eastern African country, disregarding the banning order
from the government and its warning of breaking-up.
</P>
<P>
They claimed the rallies were designed to press for
constitutional reforms and direct dialogue between the government
and the opposition before the general elections whose date is yet
to be fixed.

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Living Plant Discovered in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A leading botanist has said the
world's oldest living plant has been discovered in the Tasmanian
wilderness in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen Harris, chief of the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife
Service, said tests indicated the Lomatia tasmanica (Lomatia
tasmanica), commonly known as King's Holly, was 43,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
The plant, found in a one square kilometer patch of rainforest
in Tasmania's south-western World Heritage Area, was originally
found in the 1930s but its age had never been suspected, Dr.
Harris was quoted today by the Australian Associated Press (AAP)
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful creation to be able to study," Dr. Harris
said.
</P>
<P>
Botanists previously thought the world's oldest living plant
was a 13,000-year-old United States huckleberry. The oldest tree
is an Arizona bristle-cone pine, dated at a youthful 4,700 years
of age.
</P>
<P>
The Tasmanian plant was a self-propagating clone, which meant
it did not produce seeds but reproduced by shedding "cuttings" of
itself onto the forest floor which grew into genetically identical
clones.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harris said the plant looked like it consisted of several
hundred individual shrubs but research had shown they were all
genetically identical, meaning they were essentially the same
plant.
</P>
<P>
Cuttings from the plant were identical to fossilized remains in
the forest floor carbon-dated at 43,000 years, according to AAP.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Harris said the plant had glossy, pointed leaves resembling
holly and flowered regularly, which was unusual for a plant that
did not seed.
</P>
<P>
He said after studying the plant's ecology and chromosomes,
scientists hoped it could eventually be reproduced and sold to
gardeners.
</P>
<P>
A cutting had lived for years in a pot at the Royal Tasmanian
Botanical Gardens, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Trade Deficit with Japan Tripples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's trade deficit with Japan
more than trippled last year from 44.4 million U.S. dollars in
1995 to 143.7 million although total trade witnessed a big
increase, the local press Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Nigeria's trade with Japan amounted to 476.7 million
U.S. Dollars, compared with 313.8 million in the previous year,
the local newspaper said, quoting a release from the Japan
External Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, the country's exports to Japan rose by 23.6
percent from 134.7 million dollars to 166.5 million, while
imports from Japan reached 310.2 million dollars, a sharp rise
from the previous year's 179.1 million.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, crude oil accounted for 95.2 percent
of Nigeria's exports to Japan to 158.5 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of the non-oil exports, sesame seed gained 6.9 million
dollars, accounting for 82.3 percent f non-oil earnings from
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's export of cocoa beans, which penetrated the Japanese
market for the first time in 1995, fell from 100,000 dollars last
year from the previous year's 300,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other non-oil commodities, including tropical wood, ornamental
fish and bones and horn cores, each fetched 100,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Japan last year mainly include iron and steel,
trucks and buses, pumps and engines, cars and motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have attributed Nigeria's improved trade
relations with Japan to the government's desperate search for
alternative trade partners as its major traditional trade
partners in the West impose some sanctions on it over its alleged
slow pace to democratic rule and human rights abuse record.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has since 1995 begun to turn to Asia, Pacific and
Latin America for more economic and trade activities as a
counterpoise to the sanctions.

integrated military structure in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the alliance's two-day summit
here today, Aznar said that Spain was satisfied with the progress
made so far in negotiations with NATO in which Spain has insisted
on a sub-regional Iberian command over all its territory including
the Canary Islands and control of the Straits of Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, Spain decided to take the necessary steps for
participating fully in the Alliance's new command structure, in
accordance with the decision taken by the Spanish Parliament,"
Aznar said in his speech, "We have started to do this, and will
continue to do so."
</P>
<P>
Aznar said on Monday after meeting with United States President
Bill Clintion that there were still problems to be solved in the
Spain-NATO negotiations, but he was confident he could make a
decision on the matter by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
NATO was founded in 1949. Spain joined it in 1982, but stayed
out of the alliance's integrated military structure.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's new military ruler,
Major Johnny Paul Koromah admitted for the first time on Monday
that the May 25 coup that brought him to power is ill-timed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with members of the Sierra Leonean Chamber of
Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, Koromah deplored that the
intervention of the military in politics is no more fashionable
in Africa, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
He, however, claimed that his coup had saved the country from
a worse calamity by striking before a planned massacre of
politicians and senior military officers on May 30 by some rebel
groups.
</P>
<P>
Koromah urged the business community to be patient with his
administration, promising that a committee that would address
their legitimate grievances would soon be set up.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the heads of foreign missions who fled the
country in the wake of the coup to come back and resume their
duties.
</P>
<P>
In another development, reports said an acute fuel shortage
has hit Freetown, paralyzing government business and commercial
activities.
</P>
<P>
The situation has forced many vehicles off the roads in Serra
Leone while many others were in long queues at the few filling
stations that still served, said the reports.

urged today to eradicate school violence by all means after a
recent string of increasingly serious violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
Deaths, suicides and violent beating have resulted over the
past few months from organized school bullying and intimidation
activities.
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of organized juvenile delinquent groups
operating across the country, and violence has affected both high
and middle schools, including girls' schools, said the Home
Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Police apprehended 913 teenagers involved in 106 organized
delinquent criminal groups during the first half of this year, of
whom 327 were arrested.
</P>
<P>
School violence has reached alarming level, said Prime Minister
Koh Kun last weekend, calling on the police, parents and teachers
to make a concerted effort to ward off violence in and around
school.
</P>
<P>
Kim asked the government to improve education and other systems
to uproot school violence, adding that the school violence should
be handled by the whole society.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Home Affair Ministry has set up a special task
force to deal with the problem and ordered nationwide crackdown on
juvenile delinquents.
</P>
<P>
Some 13,427 policemen, teachers and civic group members have
been mobilized to keep order at 7,784 schools, private libraries
and learning institutions across the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coal Producer Improving In Continued Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Technical upgrading and market
competition are expected to help China's money-losing coal
industry to show a profit by the end of this year, according to a
source at the Ministry of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
The Yanzhou Coal Mining Group Co. Ltd. in east China's Shandong
Province, which was one of the key state coal producers but which
has been debt-ridden since the 1980s, has set an example for these
mines nationwide.
</P>
<P>
With the central government's relaxing of coal price controls,
the company was brought in line with the market, and set up new
development guidelines: concentrating on coal cutting while
putting equal stress on coal cutting and other non-coal
undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The group separated the coal cutting and dressing from other
undertakings, a usual international practice. Beginning from 1993,
the group organized efforts to improve the fully mechanized coal
cutting, simplifying the multi-cutting of the thick coal seams
into one-time cutting. The major breakthrough in the coal cutting
technique helped save two-thirds of the equipment and great amount
of workforce.
</P>
<P>
These efforts helped bring in more than 150 million yuan in
direct returns annually. In addition, it has spent over 40 million
yuan annually improving equipment and its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The number of work faces in coal mines with large thick coal
seams was cut to one to two from four to five, and the number of
miners on the cutting teams was cut from 25,000 in 1990 to the
present 16,000. In 1996, its seven teams mined 2.28 million tons
of coal each, and the group's annual coal output rose to 18.645
million tons from 10.07 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Last year, sales of more than 10 non-coal undertakings topped
two billion yuan, accounting for a third of the company's total
sales.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the group raised more than 300 million
yuan for these undertakings and started 30 new construction and
expansion projects, each costing over five million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the group had 1.2 billion yuan in pre-tax profits, and
664 million yuan in net profits. In the first five months of this
year, total sales were 1.9 billion yuan, with 250 million yuan
profits, up 35 percent and 62 percent respectively year-on-year.

<HEADLINE> Economic Cooperation in China's Yellow River Valley Beneficial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nine provinces and autonomous regions
along the Yellow River Valley in China have seen their combined
GDP, which was 1.485 trillion yuan by the end of last year,
increase 153.7 percent since 1988, the year they decided to get
involved in cross-border co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The rate of growth is 24.6 percentage points higher than the
national average, according to a report by the State Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The valley has half of China's land mass and about two-fifths
of the country's 1.2 billion people, and runs all the way from
Qinghai Province in the far northwest to coastal Shandong Province
at the eastern end.
</P>
<P>
The inter-provincial co-operation has included improving
information exchanges, human resource training, sharing natural
resources, and industrial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, there were 27,000 regional cooperation
projects involving more than 24 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Many companies in the eastern part of the river valley, where
the economy is more developed, are moving production to the west
to take advantage of the natural resources and cheap labor.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Gets Funds for Power project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved of
Kenya's request for 125-million-U.S.-Dollar credit for its power
development project scheduled to start soon, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the project, which has been dormant for more than
five years due to lack of funding, is attracting considerable
interest both from foreign donors and private financiers, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Co-financiers who have shown great interest include the
European Investment Banks, Kreditanstalt Fur Wie Deraufban (KFW)
of Germany and Oversea Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's offer, which is part of the 700 million
Dollors required for Kenya's energy reforms and power development#,
comes at a time when the Kenya Power and Lighting Company has
ended power rationing nationwide.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the project, spearheaded by the World
Bank, will definitely curb the power blackouts in the eastern
African country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's total demand for industrial and commercial energy has
been rising steadily from 2.6 million tons of oil equivalent in
1991 to over 3.0 million tons in 1995, representing a growth rate
of 3.7 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Kenya imported 72 percent of its total commercial energy,
comprising crude petroleum, coal and coke and hydro-electric
energy imported from Uganda, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has planned five major power projects
with a combined capacity of 338 megawatts to be added between
1997 and 2001 but the investment in the power sector of Kenya has
stalled after the suspension of donor aid in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Cabinet Reshuffle Expected: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian newspapers indicated today
that a cabinet reshuffle is expected in hours or in days, with six
or seven ministers possibly being replaced.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper The Egyptian Gazette reported that most
of the outgoing of the 30 ministers or state ministers are those
in charge of public services and economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members with the key portfolios -- Defense Minister
Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Interior
Minister Hassan el-Alfy -- will probably remain in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Two portfolios are to be created, one for public works and the
other for Toshka, a major land-reclamation and development project
in southern and western Egypt, the Arabic newspaper Al Ahram
reported.
</P>
<P>
In remarks carried by the Al-Gomhuria newspaper Saturday,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said that candidates would be
chosen carefully to ensure a smooth succession.
</P>
<P>
"It's not possible that I appoint a minister and then discover
after a couple of months that he is not suitable. Stability is the
key," Mubarak was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak met with Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri Monday as
expectations for an imminent cabinet shakeup soared. Later in the
day, Ganzouri again met with a couple of his ministers.
</P>
<P>
In a move seen related to the reshuffle, Youssef Boutros Ghali,
state minister for cabinet affairs, cut short his week-long visit
to London and was summoned home.
</P>
<P>
Rumors about injecting new blood to the one-year-old cabinet
have been rife since the beginning of this year. No new members
have joined the cabinet since Ganzouri took office in January 1996
and a vacancy caused by the death of a minister has yet to be
filled.

<HEADLINE> Manila Adopts New Vehicle Volume Reduction Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine capital of Manila
will start next Monday the implementation of a new modified
odd-even scheme for private vehicles in an attempt to ease the
city's traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
The new vehicle volume reduction program was announced here
today by Florencio Fianza, the new traffic executive director of
the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA).
</P>
<P>
Only private vehicles will be affected by the scheme, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new scheme, he said, all private vehicles will be off
the road of Metro Manila on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays if
their plate numbers end in 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9.
</P>
<P>
Those whose plate numbers end in 2, 4, 6, 8 and 0 will not be
authorized to use all Metro Manila's streets on Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays, Fianza said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will be free-zone for private vehicles on
Sundays and holidays.
</P>
<P>
Violation of the new modified odd-even scheme will be penalized
as mandated in the previous program, Fianza said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Manila municipal authorities has tried several
schemes to ease traffic in the capital, including the odd-even
scheme.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city adopted a "Unified Vehicular Reduction
Program," under which, private cars whose plate numbers end in 0
or 1 are banned on the city's roads on Monday, 2 or 3 on Tuesday,
4 or 5 on Wednesday... The ban is lifted on Saturday and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
But all these programs have achieved little success. In Manila,
with 1.6 million vehicles on the roads, the travel speed of cars
is often limited to less than 20 kilometers during the rush hour.

<HEADLINE> Health Delivery System Declines in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's health delivery system
has deteriorated considerably, with doctors and nurses leaving
government services in great numbers,the daily ''the Herald''
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was mainly caused by a 40 percent decline in per capita
expenditure on health since the launch of economic reforms in
1991, the report said.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 nurses, including the 300 who were dismissed
following a nationwide strike last year, and some 14 doctors,
have resigned from government employment over the past 12 months
alone.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and Child Welfare has 1,500 vacant
posts for nurses, and about 80 other vacancies for doctors, said
Paulinus Sikhosana, secretary for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Although the government had increased the training capacity of
nurses, the move was not helping as such, since the Ministry of
Health was only able to retain between 50 and 60 percent of the
trained nurses.
</P>
<P>
To boost its manpower, the government was now offering nurses
training posts at all its provincial hospitals countrywide.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Offers Grain Aid to DPRK Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government recently
decided to offer 80,000 tons of free grain as aid to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
</P>
<P>
In recent years there has been a decrease in grain production
in the DPRK because of natural calamities and other reasons, and
grain is in extreme short supplies.
</P>
<P>
Some international organizations and countries have provided
humanitarian aid, and the Chinese government and people have paid
close attention to the situation and have felt sympathy for the
people of the DPRK and offered help for several times.
</P>
<P>
The 70,000 tons of grain as China's first free aid for this
year were transported to the DPRK on June 21. Proceeding from the
traditional relations between the peoples of the two countries and
from humanitarian reasons, the Chinese government has decided to
provide aid again to help the people there tide over the
difficulty of the current grain shortage.
</P>
<P>
The decision shows the consistent stand and desire of the
Chinese government to value and actively develop its traditional
friendly relations with the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Gold Price Crash Forces S. African Mine Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The plummeting gold price in
global market has forced a South African gold mine to close,
local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
Benoni Gold, a wholly owned subsidiary of Boksburg-based East
Rand Proprietary Mines, announced yesterday it had decided to
close due to technical hitchers and a free-falling gold price,
which had erased its monthly profit of 500,000 Rand (111,111 U.S.
dollars ).
</P>
<P>
Gold price slumped to a 10-and-a half year low of 315 U.S.
dollars an ounce at the close in London from last Friday's 324.50
dollars. In New York it lost seven dollars from last Thursday's
finish to close 318.25 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange's all gold index yesterday
followed gold's fall, hitting its lowest level in four-and-a-half
years.
</P>
<P>
The South African currency of Rand also weakened, losing
almost a cent to 4.5370 Rand a dollar, while bonds followed suit,
local finanncial sources said.
</P>
<P>
Following the gold crash in the world market, about 60 percent
of world gold production was being mined at a loss, analysts
said, predicting that only five gold mines in South Africa could
produce gold profitably if the price fell below 300 dollars an
ounce.

<HEADLINE> Israel OK's Global Accord on Information Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
ratified the World Trade Ministerial Declaration on trade and
information technology products to liberalize further its market,
reported The Jerusalem Post newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Trade and Industry announced Monday that
Israel will accordingly cut customs duties on computer and
telecommunications products immediately, and gradually eliminate
them by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The 40 participants in the accord include the U.S. and European
Union members, with whom Israel already has free-trade agreements,
and Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea,
Australia and Thailand, which are non-free-trade partners.
</P>
<P>
The agreement gives Israel an opportunity to join the markets
"we've never been able to get into," said Marcia Harpaz, director
of the ministry's multinational affairs department.
</P>
<P>
The document also stipulates that import taxes on more
sensitive products, such as telephone switches, antennas, printed
circuits and certain cables must be eliminated by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The information technology accord is the second of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) agreements designed to liberalize world
markets.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, the WTO issued a global accord to free the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which went into effect in February, paved the
way for Israel's two private telephone companies, Barak and Golden
Lines, to enter the markets usually controlled by state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The WTO is now negotiating a financial services accord that
would liberalize the banking, insurance and foreign exchange
rates regulations. Such an accord would be designed to make the
international investment environment more secure.
</P>
<P>
Israel produces close to 1 percent of the world's information
technology products. Information technology is a 500 billion
U.S. dollars market worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Port Deadlock Continues Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The deadlock in Bangladesh's largest
seaport Chittagong continued for the sixth day today as several
rounds of multilateral negotiations failed to settle the hassle
between the two rival unions.
</P>
<P>
Port sources said a seven-hour meeting among port authorities,
leaders of the striking workers and hatch workers ended late
Monday night without any tangible results.
</P>
<P>
The merchant workers started the strike Thursday afternoon in
protest against engagement of hatch workers in lighterage of cargo
from ships anchored at the outer anchorage.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who just ended her six-day visit
to Japan on Sunday, has pledged that her government would take
initiatives to break the stalemate immediately.
</P>
<P>
She said that this untoward situation had been created at a
time when the government was trying its best to lure foreign
investment. An incident like this in the country's principal port
would give foreign investors a wrong impression about the
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eleven opposition lawmakers in a joint statement on
Monday demanded a judicial inquiry into the deadlock at Chittagong
port.
</P>
<P>
These lawmakers blamed the ruling party's local leaders and
several officials of the port for the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Up till today, over 30 ships including nine ships at the outer
anchorage got stranded while each stranded ship had been incurring
an average demurrage of 10,000 U.S. dollars a day, which
ultimately would be passed on to the importers.
</P>
<P>
According to Customs officials, the amount of revenue loss
which has been incurred in the strike stood over one billion taka
(about 23 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the rivalry between the two union -- the
Merchant Workers' Union and the Coaster Hatch Workers Union -- has
been continuing for a long time over the sharing of work at the
hatch of vessels at the outer sea.
</P>
<P>
The hatch workers said that they were driven out from their
work by the merchant workers by force in 1986 and they were
struggling for the last few years to get back their right of
handling lighterage works at the outer sea.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Down in Uganda's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents in the Ugandan
capital Kampala have reduced by 40 percent in the first six
months this year due to police vigilance, the local daily "the
New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the police authority said the total
number of accidents in the first six months of 1997 was recorded
at 1991, a remarkable drop from the 3,335 in the same period of
1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of vehicles involved in the accidents also reduced
from 4,898 to 2,891, representing a 41 percent decrease, said the
press release.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved this through rigorous intensified checks on
all routes and roads leading into and out of the city," the
release said, adding that it is still unfortunate that 125
persons were killed for the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Most drivers have been subjected to a retest especially those
whose driving licences were in doubt, said the press release,
adding measures like this have forced city drivers with fake
licences to abandon driving completely.
</P>
<P>
To reduce accidents further, the police will continue to
promote road safety awareness to the road users through seminars,
the media and school education programs, the report said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Central Bank Optimistic on National Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's economy will grow 6.3
percent in the second half of this year, up 0.7 percentage point
from the first half of the year, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said
today.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year, the average growth rate will be 6 percent,
the central bank predicted.
</P>
<P>
Although corporate investment in equipment and plants will
continue to be sluggish, exports, construction investment and
private consumption will be on the upswing, boosting the economy
in the period, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the current account deficit for the entire year
will be 17 billion U.S. dollars, one billion dollars less than
its March projection.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices will rise 4.3 percent in 1997, down 0.2
percentage point from last year's 4.5 percent. The inflation rate
will be 2.4 percent and 1.9 percent for the first and second half
of the year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Bright economic prospects for the second half are not based on
the government's industrial restructuring policy aimed at
increasing the international competitiveness of South Korean
products through cost-effective management, bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the increase to better external economic
conditions, such as increasing world trade and the strong Japanese
yen.
</P>
<P>
But they also said that financial shortage will continue to
trouble many businesses, discouraging them from ambitious
investment in new equipment and machinery.

The statement said that the TAMOFA delegation held talks with the

<HEADLINE> Feature: Publicizing Hong Kong Basic Law (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Beijing, the law has been taught in primary and secondary
schools, and in Shanghai, university students made recordings of
the law and gave them to blind people. In Shangdong province, one
teacher, Li Chuanchen, wrote the full text of the law on a long
piece of silk and exclaimed proudly, "The return of Hong Kong is
the great concern of every Chinese."
</P>
<P>
Some misunderstandings concerning the handover were corrected
after the law was read by more people. A popular pop song at the
time says that after Hong Kong is returned every person in the
inland areas would be free to go to Hong Kong, but that is
something that is simply not in the Basic Law. Many people wrote
letters to newspaper editors criticizing the person who composed
the song.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jianfan said that the Basic Law is something of a
milestone: "The law relates to the smooth transfer and to the
long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, to the
fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, and even to the peace
and development of Asia and the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
"Publicizing the Basic Law on such a large scale shows the
Chinese government's sincerity and determination to implement
the 'One Country, Two Systems' policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is perhaps the reason why the law has been welcomed in
Hong Kong. One book on the law has been on the top-ten list of
best sellers in the region. And an education committee has set up
an eight-million-HK-dollar fund to publicize the law. It will also
be taught in Hong Kong's primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
This enthusiasm has fueled a publicity campaign on the Macao
Basic Law, sources say. Macao will return to China in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, the first Chief Administrative Executive of the
Hong Kong SAR, said that the "One Country Two Systems" mechanism
will work successfully if the Basic Law is implemented well and
communications are improved.

<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren,
meeting in Beijing this morning with Raul Lema Patino, President
of the Senate of the National Congress of Bolivia, said he hopes
that Sino-Bolivian economic and trade cooperation can be further
promoted.
</P>
<P>
Rong said that Bolivia's President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's
successful state visit to China in March made a new contribution
to the development of bilateral co-operation for mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes Lema's visit will further the development
of bilateral friendship and cooperation, and noted that although
China and Bolivia are far from each other, bilateral relations
have developed smoothly since the two countries forged diplomatic
ties.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the two countries have continuously
strengthened co-operation in politics, the economy, trade and
culture, and that the co-operation has been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
China is pleased to see that in the past few years, under the
leadership of President Sanchez, the Bolivian government has made
an effort to promote political stability and economic prosperity,
and to improve the Bolivian people's lives, and has had some
remarkable achievements, Rong said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China and Bolivia are both developing
countries facing the common task of safeguarding national
sovereignty and developing the national economy, and that the two
countries, as trusted friends, share similar views on many issues
and have supported each other and had close co-operation in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lema congratulated China on the return of Hong Kong, and said
that the return shows again that Chinese people have a high-degree
of wisdom and patience. He noted that since China adopted its
reforms and opening-up policy, it has accomplished a lot in
economic construction and in improving people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Lema said he hopes to further strengthen bilateral political,
economic and cultural co-operation, as well as co-operation among
developing countries.

<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will exchange its oil products
for the Philippines' food and other commodities under a 185
million U.S. dollar trade accord signed between the two countries,
the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the trade agreement was signed by the two
countries when an Iraqi mission visited Manila recently.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had proposed an oil-for-food counter-trade scheme under
which it will exchange its oil for Philippine food products, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil trade is regulated under United Nations trade
sanctions imposed on the country as a consequence of its 1991
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
But the United Nations allows Iraq to spend up to four billion
dollars from its oil revenue for basic commodity imports including
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the trade accord, Manila will export to
Baghdad cooking oil, palm oil, sugar, rice, milk and detergents
and medicine, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Introduce High-tech Mobile Post Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Postal Authority
(IPA) is to introduce 10 high-tech mobile post offices by the end
of this year to provide convenient on-line banking and
telecommunications services, according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
The new facilities, said to be the world's first computerized
mobile post offices, are linked by a cellular phone line to the
Postal Bank computer. The first such a mobile unit has been very
successful in its trial run.
</P>
<P>
The IPA has shown the new facility to the members of the
Knesset (Israeli parliament) Economics Committee during their
recent visit to the authority in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Tery, director-general of the authority, said that by
the end of this year, another 10 computerized mobile offices
would be shuttling around the country to provide services to
local communities. There are urrently 50 mobile post routes.
</P>
<P>
The cellular-linked mobile post offices will provide on-line
banking and telecommunication services to 1,000 small communities
in the periphery, Tery said.
</P>
<P>
By using the mobile services, customers will be able to
transfer vehicle ownership, receive National Insurance Institute
payments, exchange foreign currencies, remit money overseas and
buy compulsory vehicle insurance from insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Postal Bank Director Moshe Tepper said the linkage to its
central IBM computer would allow customers to carry out
transactions in real time rather than order such services in
advance.
</P>
<P>
The mobile post office was designed by a team from Masad, or
the country's Computerized Postal Branches, with the help from
IPA staff.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Criticises Smear Campaign Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) Laurent Kabila on Monday accused some
members of the international community of conducting a smear
campaign against his government.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, arrived in Namibia on Monday for a two-day state visit
at the invitation of Namibian President Sam Nujoma, made the
remarks at a banquet in his honour at State House in Windhoek,
capital of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said there was a lot of evidence that the smear
campaign was by the same great power that "does not wish well to
the Democratic Republic of Congo", formerly known as Zaire, local
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the refugee problem, Kabila said that not even
France or the United Nations High Commission for Refugees had
been able to achieve what he had done -- send home one million
Hutu refugees to neighbouring Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"Not one of the great power said thand you," he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community, some members of which "shared the
cake" in the former Zaire until former president Mobutu Sese Seko
was ousted in May, did not demand democracy for more than 30
years, but it was demanded of his new government in just three
days, Kabila said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day tour to Namibia is Kabila's second official visit
out of his new DRC since taking power in May.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Kabila and Nujoma held official discussions about
the possibility of Namibia drawing water from the Congo River,
the bilateral cooperation in the fields of transport,
communications and economic relationship between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Publicizing The Hong Kong Basic Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Wu Jianfan became famous over night
earlier this year when he was asked to talk to President Jiang
Zemin and other Chinese leaders about the ABCs of the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, at Zhongnanhai,
headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
And, he became busier than ever. "After that, I had to deal
with several calls from different people and units every day, all
inviting me to give the same lecture to them," said the
mild-mannered member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Wu was a member of a panel that drafted the law that supports
the "One Country, Two Systems" and encourages Hong Kong people to
rule Hong Kong. "Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders, listened
carefully, took notes seriously, and raised a number of profound
questions," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu's lecture was broadcast by China Central Television to
millions of viewers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The law took effect on July 1, when Hong Kong returned to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong to think that the Basic Law is implemented in Hong
Kong and has nothing to do with the inland areas. It is the
concern of the whole nation and relates to every citizen," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The law was approved by the National People's Congress, China's
top legislature, in April of 1990. Since then, Chinese lawmakers
and government workers have been publicizing it.
</P>
<P>
Anything related to the Basic Law over the past seven years was
covered by the media in detail.
</P>
<P>
First, it is a stunning historical event rather than an
abstract text and included the Sino-British negotiations, the
election of the administrative executive, and the establishment of
the provisional legislature. These showed many Chinese people how
important the law is, Wu explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the past few years, dozens of different versions of the
Basic Law have appeared on the market, ranging from books and
picture albums to audio and visual aids. Some experts say that
more than 10 million copies of the full text have been distributed
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Xin Guangwei, a member of the Press and Publications
Administration, said that the publicity campaign is unusual in
terms of scale when compared with similar programs for other laws.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the handover, "People's Daily", Xinhua and other
key state news sources were busy releasing editorials and
commentaries on the importance of the law. The barrage was
supported by other powerful media. Internet even had a web site
operated by the telecommunications department.
</P>
<P>
Officers and enlisted men of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) to be stationed in Hong Kong also became students of
the law. "Studying it enabled us to better understand the defense
system in Hong Kong as well as our responsibilities," noted Xiong
Ziren, political commissar of the troops.
</P>
<P>
The PLA's General Political Department then ordered the army as
a whole to study the law.
</P>
<P>
The law has understandably caught the attention of business
people. "Executives from Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong say that
they will firmly observe the law," said Gu Yongjiang, who is in
charge of a Chinese business association in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The general public also showed a great deal of interest. One
contest that was held by Guangzhou's Yangcheng Evening News
attracted 100,000 readers who wrote in answers to questions
like: "What does the HKSAR emblem looks like?"
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese capital, some 1,000 lawyers took to the streets
and lanes to explain the law to local citizens. And one agency
even sent its employees to villages to explain to farmers just
what "One Country, Two Systems" means.

<HEADLINE> Five Arrested For Killing Sri Lankan Tamil MP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Police Monday arrested
five persons suspected of having assassinated Tamil
Parliamentarian Arunachalam Thangathurai and four others at
Trincomalee on Saturday night, according to police sources here
today.
</P>
<P>
All five arrested persons are believed to be cadres of the
rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) whom police say are
the masterminds behind the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Several clues on those lines have been uncovered, the sources
said, adding that "the style in which the attack was carried out
and certain other tell-tale signs will lead us to the culprits."
</P>
<P>
Thangathurai is among several leaders of the Tamil United
Liberation Front (TULF) who have been assassinated by the LTTE,
starting with the assassination of Jaffna Mayor Alfred Thuraiappah
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The TULF, one of the mainstream Tamil political parties in Sri
Lanka, supports the ruling people's Alliance government.
</P>
<P>
TULF President M. Sivasithamparam has condemned the killing as
a cowardly and reprehensible act. He was an ardent supporter of
the peace process and had rendered enormous service to the Tamil
community in the process of settling the ethnic issue, said a TULF
statement issued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
All other Tamil political parties condemned the killing as a
cowardly act. The ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party also condemned
the assassination.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM, Former PM Clash Over Genocide Tag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard has clashed with former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser over
the latter's claim that forced removals of aboriginal children
from their parents amounted to genocide.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister has backed a Human Rights and Equal
Opportunity Commission (HREOC) report which finds that the
practice of forced removals of up to 100,000 aboriginal children
from their families during 1910 and 1970 was genocide under
international law definition.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard said today the word genocide was
inappropriate term for practices of assimilation.
</P>
<P>
"I stand by the statements I have made previously that to use
the word genocide in relation to the practices of the removal of
children was inappropriate," Howard told a local radio.
</P>
<P>
Fraser said yesterday that the term genocide was appropriate
because the policy has sought to achieve the disappearance of the
aboriginal race over a long term. He warned that Australia faced a
moral crisis over its handling of aboriginal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Howard said: "I know all Australians, myself included, would
regard them (the practices of forced removals) in this day and age
as utterly and completely unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
"To use the word genocide was the wrong use of the word and I
understand that we will have to agree to disagree," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has said its legal advice is that the
practices do not fulfill the requirements for the definition of
genocide under international laws.
</P>
<P>
Fraser said today he was unaware his statement contradicted
views put by the government.
</P>
<P>
Howard offered personal apology late last May to aboriginal
people over the sufferings inflicted upon them by the official
practices of the removals.
</P>
<P>
The HREOC report issued last May calls for government apology
for the practices and financial compensation for the victims. The
proposal was rejected by government ministers.
</P>
<P>
Justice Marcus Einfeld, who was former head of the official
Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, said yesterday
Australian political leaders should recognize the "violent
history" of black-white relations in the same way former South
African President F W de Klerk apologized for apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Einfeld said he felt ashamed of the government policy of
destroying aboriginal culture by forcibly removing children from
their families and culture.
</P>
<P>
Some state governor and church leaders have apologized formally
for the practices of removal during the past month.

<HEADLINE> Nomura Suspected of Having Paid Two More Racketeers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan's biggest brokerage, Nomura
Securities, is suspected of having paid a total of 110 million yen
(980,000 U.S. dollars) in cash to a further two "sokaiya,"
corporate racketeers, as compensation for stock investment losses
before 1993, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The cash was used to make up for losses stemming from stock
deals made by Nomura dealers for the accounts of the two sokaiya,
a practice that runs counter to Japan's Securities and Exchange
Law, sources familiar with the case were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The payment in question also violates the Commercial Code,
which bans corporate payoffs to sokaiya. However, the two sokaiya
cannot be charged because the three-year statute of limitations
has run out.
</P>
<P>
Nomura is embroiled in a scandal involving alleged payments to
sokaiya Ryuichi Koike who has been indicted on charges of
receiving 49.7 million yen (440,000 dollars) from Nomura between
January and June 1995 for agreeing not to disrupt a Nomura
shareholders meeting in June that year.
</P>
<P>
He is also suspected of taking 320 million yen (2.83 million
dollars) in cash from Nomura to cover stock investment losses in
March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The scandal, the second involving Nomura in six years, has led
to the arrest of four Nomura executives, including its former
President Hideo Sakamaki.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Slashes Tariffs, Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has cut
import tariffs on 1,600 items, slashed the number of local taxes
and fees, banned new loans for land acquisition and development,
and allowed imports of used cargo and fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
These measures were stipulated in a new package of economic
reforms announced last night.
</P>
<P>
"The measures are a continuation of preceding deregulation
policies aimed at improving efficiency and simultaneously to
confirm our commitment to multilateral trade agreements,"
Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance Saleh Afiff said.
</P>
<P>
The package cuts tariff rates on 1,461 industrial products, 136
agricultural commodities and three health products.
</P>
<P>
"After this latest deregulation package, 62.55 percent of the
total tariff codes will be in the range of 0 to 10 percent," said
Afiff.
</P>
<P>
Afiff said the number of items with zero tariff rose to 1,419
from 1,399, while the number of items with a 5 percent tariff rose
to 2,275 from 2,066. Those with a 10 percent tariff increased to
1,556 from 610.
</P>
<P>
"This reform decreased Indonesian average, unweighted import
tariffs from 13 percent to 11.9 percent, the second lowest in
Southeast Asian countries after Singapore," he said.
</P>
<P>
No further details on the tariff reductions were immediately
available as the government only announced a summary of the
ministerial decrees, rules and directives which enforce the
measures.
</P>
<P>
A complete set of the measures in technical detail is to be
distributed today.
</P>
<P>
The government last year introduced two reform packages in
January and June respectively.
</P>
<P>
The measures also free imports of used fishing and cargo
vessels in a bid to further develop efficient inter-island
freighter services and bolster the fisheries industry.
</P>
<P>
In an another concerted drive to reduce the costs of doing
business in the country, the number of local taxes was cut from 42
to nine and local fees or levies from 192 categories to 30
categories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an effort to control increased lending to the
property sector, Bank Indonesia issued a decree Monday which bans
new loans for land acquisition and development by property
companies, except for the development of cheap housing.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Married Couple in the World Live in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The world's oldest
married couple are both celebrating their 100th birthday this
year, the newspaper El Nuevo Siglo reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Rudesindo Montenegro Carvajal and Amparo
Roa, who live just outside the Colombian capital, are the oldest
surviving couple in the world and have been married for 77 years.
</P>
<P>
Montenegro was born on May 8, 1897 in Manta in the Central
department of Cundinamarca while Roa will turn 100 on August 28,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The couple, who are second cousins, were married on March 14,
1920 in the San Joaquin church in Manta by Assistant Vicar
Guillermo Garavito.
</P>
<P>
The copy of the marriage certificate issued by the church said
that they were granted a dispensation against marriages between
relatives.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper, the couple had only one
explanation for their longevity: "God has wanted this to be."
</P>
<P>
One key to their longevity may be in what they eat. Their
youngest son Arsenio said that they have eaten tortillas, cheese,
eggs and peas all their lives.
</P>
<P>
The 100-year old couple have 9 children (a son and a daughter
have died), 45 grandchildren, 55 great grandchildren and 10 great
great grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
They have spent the last 40 years on a small farm in Tabio,
Cundinamarca, west of the capital.

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed in Renewed Clash in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 Muslim rebels were
killed and seven army soldiers wounded Monday when the two sides
clashed fiercely anew in central Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted again when the separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas shelled a former MILF camp they
lost to the military late last month, the reports quoted a
military spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Noel Detoyato, spokesman for the Army's Sixth Infantry
Division, said the government troops, backed by tanks and
helicopter gunships, had repulsed the attack by the rebels on Camp
Rajah Muda in Pikit town, Cotabato province.
</P>
<P>
The government troops overran the camp, the second largest MILF
headquarters, on June 28 after two weeks of military offensives.
The MILF had vowed to retake the camp and had been massing its
forces in preparation for a siege.
</P>
<P>
The latest outbreak of hostilities in the region has dimmed
prospects of reopening exploratory talks between the government
and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which suspended peace talks with Manila soon after
the fall of Rajah Muda, Monday laid down four conditions for the
group to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The conditions include cessation of military operations by the
government and return of all government troops to the barracks in
the region. But these conditions were reportedly rejected by the
military.

<P>
YANGON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities seized
nearly 198 tons of illegal forest products in the country's Bago
division at the end of last month, the official paper The New

</P>
<P>
The forest products, which were confiscated mostly in the
Nyaunglebin township by local Forest Department Authorities,

canes.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's hardwood export in the 1996-97 fiscal year ended
March was estimated at 142,000 cubic meters, while that of teak at
184,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UN to Help China Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' Development
Program (UNDP) will give 1.89 million US dollars to the Chinese
Government to fight HIV/AIDS in the next four years, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on co-operation has been drawn up and will be
signed soon between UNDP and several Chinese ministries and
provincial governments, according to the UNDP's China Office.
</P>
<P>
The four-year project, which starts this month, aims to assist
the central government and the provincial governments of Fujian,
Guangdong and Hainan in preventing and controlling HIV
transmission.
</P>
<P>
To be developed are appropriate responses directed to
communities and population groups with the highest risks of
acquiring HIV. These activities will be supported by
multi-sectional efforts at national and local levels and
complemented by national policy development, said the UNDP official.
</P>
<P>
The project will help increase the management and training
capacity of the Ministry of Health, increase HIV/STD programs in
other ministries and carry out intervention activities among
high-risk population groups, said Shen Jie, division chief in
charge of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases control with
the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Shen said she was very satisfied with previous UNDP-China
collaborations in this field. UNDP started to aid China in
HIV/AIDS control in the summer of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The country received 1.1 million US dollars from UNDP during
the last three and half years to carry out activities aimed at
minimizing HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP also helped the country establish the capacity to
produce high quality educational written, audio and visual
materials that can be reproduced and distributed in the country.

<HEADLINE> China To Help Laid-off Workers Find New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China has asked local officials to
try harder to find employment for laid-off workers and guarantee
their basic living standard this year, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labour, along with another 11 government
departments, has jointly issued a directive ordering provincial
officials to create new jobs for more than half of local jobless
workers.
</P>
<P>
The rules apply to China's pilot cities chosen for implementing
bankruptcies: Under State guidance, these cities urge debt-laden
State enterprises to declare bankruptcy. While ending loss-making
operations, this restructuring does exact a toll.
</P>
<P>
The government has expanded the number of these key pilot
cities to 111 this year from 58.
</P>
<P>
The four million jobless and laid-off workers will gain new
employment opportunities through a re-employment project, said
Labour Minister Li Boyong.
</P>
<P>
Labour departments should play an active role in helping make
macro-economic policy, promoting job opportunities and helping
labourers adjust to the market economy including training schemes,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, the number of urban and rural labourers
will increase greatly. Li estimated there are 13.7 million urban
people to be settled while only 7.8 million people can find
jobs. Unemployment will hit 5.9 million by the end of this year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
To ease the pressure on laid-off workers from State
enterprises, the re-employment project will continue to be
launched, while at the same time deepening economic reform in the
200 selected pilot cities, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials should also take measures to prevent workers'
income from falling short of the minimum living standard set by
each municipal government.

<P>
ATHENS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today pledged
to support Albania's Socialist Party after it won a landslide
victory in general elections on June 29.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a telephone conversation, Greek Prime Minister
Costantinos Simitis assured Albania's Socialist Party leader Fatos
Nano that Athens would be "on the side of Albania" and was ready
to provide assistance to help restore order there, acting
government spokesman Nikos Athanasakis said today.
</P>
<P>
Nano informed Simitis that his party had won a two-thirds
majority in the Albanian parliament over President Sali Berisha's
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Greece said recently it hoped the elections in Albania would
result in a government of the widest possible consensus to
undertake the work of restoring order in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian general elections followed a civil conflict
sparked by the collapse of pyramid investment schemes in
January. More than 1,500 people were killed in the clashes.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Justice Minister Sergy
Holovaty should be condemned and Coal Industry Minister Yuri
Rusantsov should be fired due to their failure in fighting crimes,
acting Prime Minister Vasyl Durdynets said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cabinet meeting, he said that some government
ministries, including the Justice Ministry and the ministry of
Coal Industry, turned a blind eye to the serious corruption within
their organizations.
</P>
<P>
No significant achievements have been made in fighting against
crimes and criminal cases are still rising despite efforts made by
the president and government, Durdynets added.
</P>
<P>
Through examining the implementation of anti-corruption laws,
the prime minister said that he has found the grounds for the
increase of crimes -- the inability of law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, a large number of criminal cases
have emerged, especially the sharp increase of economic crimes and
corruption cases, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He did not reveal the details, but stressed that the
wide-spread corruption has severely damaged the reputation of the
country.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- WBA heavyweight champion
Evander Holyfield met President Nelson Mandela on Monday and gave
him with his personal purple and white boxing robe.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, a former amateur boxer, praised Holyfield's style and

</P>
<P>
Holyfield, on a business to South Africa, was accompanied by
his wife Janice and Mandela by his companion Graca Machel of
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"He is a three times world champion and therefore his style is
the envy of many boxers," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield retained his title in Las Vegas on June 28 when
opponent Mike Tyson was disqualified for twice biting Holyfield's
ears.

<HEADLINE> Greece Pledges to Support Socialists in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government pledged today
to support Albania's Socialist Party after the latter won a
landslide victory in the country's general elections on June 29.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a telephone conversation, Greece's Prime Minister
Costas Simitis told Albania's Socialist Party leader Fatos Nano
that Athens would be "on the side of Albania" and offered to
provide assistance to restore order in the neighboring country,
acting government spokesman Nikos Athanasakis told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Athanasakis said that Nano officially informed Simitis that his
party had won a two-thirds majority in the Albanian parliament
over President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the Greek troops participating in
the Italian-led multinational protection force in Albania would
begin its gradual withdrawal from the country on 18 July.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the Greek contingent could prolong their
presence in Albania if the new Albanian government hoped them to
do so.
</P>
<P>
The general elections in Albania came after months of civil
conflict sparked by the collapse of pyramid investment schemes in
January. More than 1,500 people were killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Greece said recently that it hoped the completion of the
electoral process in Albania would result in a government of the
widest possible consensus to undertake the work of restoring order
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Kipketer Equalls 800m World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Wilson Kipketer of Denmark was on
a edge to break the oldest world track record on Monday when he
equalled Sebastian Coe's 16-year-old 800 meters mark at the
Stockholm Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan-born Dane was clocked one minute 41,73 seconds to
have a share of the world record. However, the clock first showed
that Kipketer was timed at one minute 41.74 seconds, 0.01 of a
second outside Coe's mark.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer emigrated to Denmark in 1990, was ranked world number
one in 1994 and raced away with the world title in Gothenburg in
the following year.
</P>
<P>
Following protests by the Kenyan Federation he was not allowed
to compete for Denmark at last year's Atlanta Olympics but was
still the world number one with five successive times under 1:42.
</P>
<P>
He broke the world indoor record twice at the Paris world
championships in March and was clearly set to mount a serious
assault on a mark which has defied the best two-lap runners in the
world since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Three times world steeplechase champion Moses Kiptanui, who had
not trained since the middle of last month through illness, failed
in a valiant bid on his own world record earlier in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
But his time of 8:01.80 was still the third fastest in history
and only the Kenyan himself has ever run faster.
</P>
<P>
Moroccan Hicham el Guerrouj, just half a second outside
Noureddine Morceli's world mile record in Oslo on Friday, was
again a disappointed man.
</P>
<P>
El Guerrouj clocked 3:29.30 seconds over 1,500, outside
Morceli's world mark. But it was the fastest time of the year and
only Morceli has ever run faster.
</P>
<P>
One man clearly delighted with his night's work on a sweltering
Scandinavian evening at the venue which staged the 1912 Olympics
was Trinidad's Ato Boldon.
</P>
<P>
Boldon, bronze medallist in both the 100 and 200 in Atlanta,
won the 100 in 9.95 seconds and followed with victory in the 200
in 19.82 seconds, fastest this year and sixth fastest of all time.
</P>
<P>
The impressive American 100 champion Marion Jones won the
women's 200 in a year's best of 22.16 and there was another year's
best for Slovenia's Igor Kovacs who clocked 13.13 with a following
wind of 1.6 meters in the 110 meters hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Despite the string of world class performances in the
penultimate grand prix before the world championships, the most
popular man of the night was nine times Olympic champion Carl
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, sporting a new hairstyle which gave him a passing
resemblance to former French tennis champion Yannick Noah,
anchored the Santa Monica Track Club to victory in the 4x100 relay
and was still signing autographs in the infield well after the
meeting had finished.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson dropped from the World
Boxing Association ratings Monday after his infamous bitings of
Evander Holyfield's ears in their June 28 bout in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
The ratings committee of the Caracas-based WBA said it was
dropping Tyson because according to its regulations no boxer who
has been suspended by a local commission can be rated by the WBA.
</P>
<P>
Tyson has also been suspended by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"We are acting in solidarity with the commission of Las Vegas,"
said Alberto Sarmiento, one of the seven members of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The former champion's biting "was an illegal act, like poking a
finger in the eye, and deserves to be sanctioned," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Tyson could be reinstated in the rankings if the Nevada
commission ends his suspension.
</P>
<P>
South African boxer Franz Botha was promoted to the No. 1
challenger's spot.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican police reported 94
homicides in the first half of this year, the Cosa Rican Judicial
Investigation Organization (OIJ) announced today.
</P>
<P>
San Jose had the largest number of murders with 49, followed by
Limon, a city 131 kilometers east of the capital with 17, while
Heredia was the city with the least violence with 4 murders, the
OIJ said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
One of the most disturbing crimes in Costa Rica was the murder
of Kristal Autiel Fernandez, a seven-year-old girl who was killed
in a hotel in the capital city on January 19.
</P>
<P>
Of the 94 homicides reported between January and June, 50 were
caused by firearms.
</P>
<P>
According to police statistics, homicides doubled in Costa Rica
during the first half of this decade.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Laura Chinchilla attributed the higher
crime rate to the enormous numbers of firearms in the hands of
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Sociologist Rocio Fernandez believes that the
economic crisis and the disintegration of families are the most
important reasons for the increase in violence in the country.

KIEV, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China is an
enormous success for China's foreign policy, Vladisslav Shednev,
chairman of the All Ukrainian Center of the Chinese Language was
quoted as saying by the press today.

Praising the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's concept of
"one country, two systems," Shednev said that Deng's use of
peaceful means to get Hong Kong back was a great contribution to
global stability.

"If the 'one country, two systems' principle succeeds in China,
it will be the first time in history for two different political
systems to exist in one country," the chairman added.
</P>

Mikhail Pavlovsky, chairman of the Ukrainian-Chinese Friendship
Committee of the Ukrainian parliament, said Hong Kong's return is
not only the restoration of justice, but also a great achievement
for China's foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fire Declines Markedly in Southeast China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian Province
has seen a dramatic decrease in the number of forest fires this
year, thanks to local greater attention paid to forest fire
control.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the year, there were 127 forest fires
in the province, a big drop from the figure 417 that hit during
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the amount of forests destroyed by fire fell to
1,278 ha. from 4,346 ha. in 1996, and the number of casualties was
down 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
As part of this effort, 25,000 km of fire-prevention belts were
built and professional forest fire brigades were organized in most
of the 38 major counties in the vast forest area.
</P>
<P>
The larger amount of spring rainfall this year also helped keep
down the threat of forest fires in the province.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Speeds up Construction of Key Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 23.5 billion yuan is to be
invested in 58 key projects in southwest China's Sichuan Province
this year, a 42 percent rise over the figure for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Most of the projects will involve infrastructure construction
and hi-tech industries, such as iron and steel plants, railways,
highways and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The projects are expected to include the building of 14
satellite ground stations, and the adding of five million kw of
electricity generating capacity, more than two billion cu m of
reservoirs and nearly 240,000 ha of irrigated land. In addition,
more than 710 km of railways, 157 km of electrified railway lines
and 403 km of highways will be built.
</P>
<P>
In order to speed up such construction, the province has raised
money from different channels and has introduced nearly 1.7
billion yuan of overseas investment for 15 projects. Also, nearly
1.1 billion yuan has also been raised by enterprises and through
the issuing of stocks.

<HEADLINE> US Government Approves British Takeover of MCI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
today approved the British Telecommunications (BT) takeover of MCI
Communications, a deal which is regarded as the biggest foreign
takeover of a U.S. corporation.
</P>
<P>
The department's green light clears a crucial regulatory hurdle
for the purchase of the nation's second-largest long-distance
company.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed merger still requires approval from the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and a few state regulatory
bodies, including one in California.
</P>
<P>
The European Union in May okayed the proposed merger subject to
conditions to protect competition. The shareholders of the BT and
MCI also have approved the transaction.
</P>
<P>
When the London-based British Telecommunications and MCI
Communications announced their merger proposal in November of
1996, the deal was valued at 20.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the combined company would rank second only to AT&AMP;T
as a long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
The combined company would have annual revenues of 43 billion
dollars and 43 million business and residential customers in 72
countries. It would be called Concert, after a joint venture began
four years ago when the BT bought a 20 percent stake in MCI.
</P>
<P>
British Telecom shareholders would have about 66 percent of
Concert, and MCI shareholders the rest.

<HEADLINE> Germany, US Lobby for Tax-Free Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Both German and U.S. officials said
here today that governments should not levy new taxes on business
conducted over the Internet and, instead, they should turn it into
a "free trade zone."
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international meeting on Internet opened in Bonn
today, German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said, "We must
support digital commerce and should not put it under new burdens."
</P>
<P>
Noting that trade over the Internet could reach several hundred
billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000, Rexrodt said governments
should allow the international computer network to develop as free
as possible in order to make full use of its economic potential.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt's U.S. counterpart, William Daley, today also warned
against too many national regulations on the Internet. "The
Internet should not become a national market," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton issued a report last week deciding
not to impose new taxes or regulations on business conducted over
the Internet and instead will largely allow the private sector to
determine on its own how it will operate in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
Daley said the United States and the European Union (EU) have
more common ground on this issue than their differences.
</P>
<P>
Despite the support for a market-oriented approach, EU
commissioner Martin Bangemann said at the meeting in Bonn that the
EU still favors a set of minimum international regulations to
safeguard the Internet against criminal content and to enable data
protection.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
meanwhile announced in Bonn that it would organize a conference in
Canada in autumn next year to discuss necessary Internet
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Internet meeting in Bonn was sponsored by the EU and were
attended by 40 government ministers and 80 international companies
and organizations. On Tuesday, the EU ministers are expected to
adopt a unbinding declaration to make clear their positions on the
use of the Internet.

<HEADLINE> More Than 100 Countries to Observe World Population Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 countries will
commemorate World Population Day on July 11 with special events,
according to the UN Department of Public Information.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued today, the UN department reported
that the theme for this year's observance is adolescent
reproductive health care. In particular, the focus is on the need
to provide adolescents with sex education and reproductive health
care so that they can make informed choices, including how to
protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy and sexually
transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
Among the events planned throughout the world are rallies and
speeches by national and local leaders; lectures; seminars; radio,
television and film programs; newspaper and magazine supplements;
special publications; exhibits and sports events.
</P>
<P>
To mark World Population Day, the United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) is issuing three booklets: "Generation 97," the
results of a survey of the views of young women and men on sexual
and reproductive health; "The Youth Perspective," which includes
the winning entries of the 1996 International Youth Essay Contest
of the UNFPA; and "UNFPA and Adolescents," a discussion of the
special problems that adolescents face and a description of how
the UNFPA designs and implements programs that address those
problems.
</P>
<P>
World Population Day was first celebrated in 1987, when the
world population reached 5 billion. The United Nations authorized
the event as a vehicle to build awareness of population issues and
the impact they have on development and the environment.

UNITED NATIONS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Five more countries have
ratified the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women in the past months this year,
bringing the total number of parties to the convention to 160, a

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Falls Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell to a nearly
four-week low against the yen today after Japan reported a surge
in its June trade surplus, refreshing concern that the U.S.
currency's strength is hurting American exporters.
</P>
<P>
But the dollar recovered from an early selloff against the mark
and ended higher against the pound, helped by British economic
data that showed unexpected manufacturing weakness.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the foreign-exchange volume was thin due to summer
vacations, exaggerating currency movements. But the rise in
Japan's surplus surprised the market.
</P>
<P>
The data showed Japan's surplus rose to 453.20 billion yen in
the first 20 days of June, far more than expected and more than
double the 197.65 billion yen surplus a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The dollar traded as low as 112.16 yen in intraday dealings
before settling in New York at 112.77 yen, down from 113.890 yen
Thursday and the lowest closing level since June 11.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also fell to an intraday low of 1.7421 marks before
recovering to settle at 1.7521 marks in New York, down from 1.7535
marks Thursday. The pound cost 1.6886 U.S. dollars, down from
1.6906 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday: 1.4610
Swiss francs, down from 1.4697; 5.9056 French francs, up from
5.9055; 1,706.00 Italian lire, up from 1,705.00; 1.3767 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.3730.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finances Reforms in Kenya's Power Sub-Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the approval of a 125 million U.S. dollar credit for Kenya to back
the government's reform in the power sub-sector.
</P>
<P>
The energy sector investment project, the total cost of which
is estimated at some 1 billion dollars, is designed to result in
the development of an efficient and viable energy sector to
support the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The project includes sector restructuring and reorganization,
legal and regulatory reforms for the power sub-sector and
facilitate private sector entry, power expansion and
rehabilitation at least-cost, including two 75 MW power plants in
Mombassa, two 32 MW power plants at Olkaria and a 60 MW hydropower
plant on the Sondu River.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the concessionary lending arm of
the World Bank. In addition to the IDA credit, the Commonwealth
Development Corporation and the European Investment Bank are also
considering cofinancing the project.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Predicts 3 Nations for NATO's Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
predicted today that only three nations would be invited to join
NATO at the alliance's Madrid summit which starts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton flew to the Spanish capital on the eve of the two-day
summit which faces a hard debate over whether to limit the
alliance's eastward expansion to three -- Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic -- or to include Slovenia and Romania as well.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the consensus decision will be for three, but I
hope and believe there will be a clear message that the door to
NATO remains open," Clinton told reporters after meeting with a
bi-partisan delegation of Republican and Democratic members of the
U.S. Congress in Spain for the summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton clearly sought to soften his opposition to allowing
Romania and Slovenia NATO membership now, saying he was "very
enthusiastic about the developments that have taken place" in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad they want to be in NATO," he said, "and I think that
they should get consideration. I just don't think at this time
that they should be admitted."
</P>
<P>
France and Italy, supported by seven other NATO members
predominately from southern Europe, have lobbied hard for the
candidatures of Romania and Slovenia as well, in an effort to
avoid too heavy a shift in NATO's future orientation toward
Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
While reaffirming that five countries now fulfilled the
conditions for joining, France indicated in a statement on July 2
that it would not block the admission of only three countries if
Clinton insisted.
</P>
<P>
"The consensus has yet to be reached and the final decision
will be taken by the heads of state and government of the (NATO)
member states on Tuesday," a Senior NATO official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the 16 NATO leaders Tuesday would not
only make a decision regarding the expansion list, but also
announce "the policy of open door."
</P>
<P>
"NATO enlargement is not a one-shot operation... the leaders
will also give substances to NATO's declaration of open door," he
said.
</P>
<P>
It seems already clear that President Clinton will get his way
to limit the accession group to three.
</P>
<P>
"Now people are waiting to see what kind of language would be
used in the Communique due to be released on Tuesday regarding
NATO's commitment to include Romania and Slovenia in the second
wave, which will probably be announced in 1999 when the first
three formally join the alliance," an expert said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Exports of British Beef Seized in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A shipment of 170 tons of illegally
exported British beef has been confiscated by German authorities
on the Baltic Sea island of Ruegen, reports reaching here today
said.
</P>
<P>
The beef, which was on its way to Russia, had been exported by
a Belgian firm using forged papers, a German official said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission confirmed last Friday that Belgian
authorities were investigating two Belgian firms involved in
exports of British beef in defiance of a worldwide ban.
</P>
<P>
It also said that about 1,600 tons of British beef had been
exported illegally using forged Belgian papers.
</P>
<P>
The ban on British beef exports was imposed in March 1996 after
scientists said that the so-called "mad cow" disease, officially
known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), could spread to
humans in the form of the deadly Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease.

<HEADLINE> Muslims, Croats Fail to Reach Joint Police Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslims and Croats today
failed again to sign an agreement on the establishment of a joint
police force in the Herzegovina-Neretva canton, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is the precondition demanded by the Muslim side
for a summit between Chairman of the Bosnian Presidency Alija
Izetbegovic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. The summit,
originally scheduled for June 30, has been postponed for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Fatima Leho, governor of the Herzegovina-Neretva canton, was
quoted as saying today that the agreement was not reached because
Croat representatives insist on establishing the ethnic balance of
the joint police force based on the current population structure.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim side wants to form the police force on the basis of
the pre-war 1991 census. The Herzegovina-Heretva canton covers
Mostar, which is largely Croat-dominated, with majorities of
Muslims and other nationalities fleeing as refugees.
