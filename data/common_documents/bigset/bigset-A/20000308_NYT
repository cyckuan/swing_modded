LITTLE LUCK BRINGS PEPPERDINE TO .500
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pepperdine baseball coach Frank Sanchez found a
penny on the ground Tuesday. He put it in his ear for good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever works.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine is relying on savvy, timely hitting, and yes, even
luck, to get above the .500 mark. The Waves took a step at Cal
State Northridge, beating the host Matadors 6-3 in a nonconference
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long haul, just trying to get consistency,''
Sanchez said after Pepperdine improved to 9-9. At this point last
season, the Waves were 17-1. ``Up until today, we've been trying to
identify who can do what and who can pitch where. It's been hit-
and-miss.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (7-10) is in the same situation but with a different goal.
The Matadors are one of the youngest teams in the nation and five
freshmen and sophomores started against the Waves. Four of
Northridge's six pitchers Tuesday were also underclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine wants to get back to the NCAA playoffs. Northridge
wants respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to run 10 freshmen and sophomores against
Pepperdine and you're going to take your lumps,'' CSUN coach Mike
Batesole said. ``We're playing as tough a schedule as we can play.
In the process, you're going to get slugged in the mouth a few
times.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened only once on this cold, rainy afternoon. The
Matadors took a 3-1 lead into the seventh, but the Waves rallied
for five runs. The last two came on a two-out home run by Dane
Sardinha, a preseason All-American catcher, off reliever Merrill
Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give (Sardinha) credit, he hit a good pitch,'' Batesole said.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the seventh, though, and CSUN looked like a team
that's slowly finding its way. Northridge is a program on the rise,
which is peculiar, considering the Matadors are 165-96-1 in the
last four-plus seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, junior third baseman Bobby Koba made a nice
play on a sharp grounder by Damon Katz, snaring the ball on a dive
to his left and throwing out Katz by a stride. The next inning,
freshman right fielder Tim Coltey made a diving catch on Duke
Sardinha's long foul ball near the fence.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's top five hitters each got a hit. Freshman
outfielder-pitcher Bill Murphy had a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get four recruiting classes like I've had these last two,''
Batesole said, ``and we're not 7-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are looking up a little for the Waves, too.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Cliffords (El Camino Real) was 2 for 2 with two runs
scored. On the mound, freshman Jason Provisor, a little-used
right-hander from Cincinnati, started and pitched three hitless
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Provisor, who retired 14 in a row in relief in Saturday's 12-9
loss at Gonzaga, struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we found a diamond in the rough,'' Sanchez said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore crushed their
rivals from ocean to ocean Tuesday in powerful displays that
assured them their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   After claiming the two biggest electoral powerhouses of
California and New York, which account for more than 40 percent of
the delegates chosen Tuesday, Bush and Gore immediately turned to
each other _ and to firing the first salvos of the general election
campaign that lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victories over former Sen. Bill Bradley were particularly
impressive because he was supported by a majority of every
demographic group in the 16 states with Democratic contests, and,
significantly, by women, who backed him in some states by margins
of more than 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   In several states Gore held a margin of 3-to-1 or better. Gore
also racked up a double-digit margin in New York, a victory made
even sweeter by the memory of his dismal performance in the 1988
presidential primary, where he won a paltry 10 percent and quit the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not win one state, a defeat so pronounced that his
advisers said it was only a matter of days before he withdraws.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican verdict Tuesday was decisive, though not as
overwhelming. Bush prevailed over Sen. John McCain by comfortable
margins in California and New York, as well as in Ohio and Missouri
and in the only southern state voting Tuesday, Georgia. McCain
captured five relatively small New England states: Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Gore and Bush victories in California, the most
sought-after electoral prize of all, it was not clear which of the
four contenders would prevail in that state's popular vote, which
is not binding but could be a telling measure of a candidates'
potency in November.
</P>
<P>
   Before the outcome was certain in some states, Bush declared to
supporters in Austin, Texas, that ``we have good news from sea to
shining sea'' and laid out several themes for the general election
in a combative speech that was mostly devoted to lambasting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is celebrating victory as well,'' Bush said,
struggling to contain a satisfied grin. ``I congratulate him and
look forward to the contest. He is the candidate of the status quo
in Washington, D.C., and he has a tough case to make in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``American must not give Clinton/Gore four more years,'' he
said, reciting a list of ills of the current administration. And,
pointedly, he raised Gore's fund-raising troubles, saying, ``I will
remind Al Gore that Americans do not want a White House where there
is no controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   At a boisterous rally in Nashville earlier in the evening, Gore
praised Bradley, saying he was ``moved and touched'' by his rival's
commitment to healing racial divisions.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Bush, he quickly looked to the general election,
calling on the Republican nominee to debate him twice a week, spurn
unregulated soft money donations and appear with him at open
meetings around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will challenge the Republican nominee to hold joint open
meetings with me,'' he said, ``to make this contest of ideas and
not insults, a campaign conducted in full daylight and not through
secretly funded special interest attack ads or smear telephone
calls from the extremist right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also put forth an unvarnished plea for the
independents and Republicans who backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore did not mention Bush by name, he depicted the
Republicans as intolerant. ``In this election, we are the party of
the mainstream,'' he said. ``We are the party of hope. We appeal to
hope, not anger, not to exclusion. We look to the future, not the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday night, Gore had begun concentrating his
assaults on Bush, while the Texas governor has softened his
conservative oratory in recent days, positioning himself for the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   The voting Tuesday was tantamount to a national primary. Never
before have so many states, in every region, held contests on the
same day. Roughly a third of the delegates to the parties' national
conventions were up for grabs. The Democrat needs 2,170 delegates
to get the party's nomination; the Republican needs 1,034.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side the primaries capped the most contentious
nomination battle in decades, a week-by-week electoral see-saw in
which Bush would win one round, only to be humbled by McCain in the
next. Bush entered Tuesday's voting with more victories and more
delegates. But no one could safely bet what would happen because in
the entire yearlong run-up to the primaries, Bush had been widely
viewed as the front-runner, only to see his prospects grow far more
precarious after McCain trounced him in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But McCain, of Arizona, vowed not to give up, asserting in a
brief speech at a late rally in West Hollywood: ``Our crusade
continues, tonight, tommorow, the next day, the day after that and
for as long as it takes to restore America's confidence and pride
in the practice and institutions of our great democracy.''  &UR;  &LR;  His
advisers said they and McCain would retreat to Arizona to decide
whether the senator should pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race was far less climactic Tuesday because while
Bradley emerged as a threat last fall _ polls at one point had him
beating Gore in New Hampshire _ that spurt of popularity never
translated to the voting booth. Bradley, a former senator from New
Jersey, was shut out by Gore in every contest before Tuesday.
Bradley's campaign had so sputtered that even before the voting
Tuesday, many of his most prominent supporters said it would take a
miracle for him to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At a subdued gathering in Manhattan Tuesday night, Bradley said
he had called the vice president to congratulate him _ and he
insisted that his campaign was a worthy crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our lack of victory tonight, we've shaped the national
debate in this campaign,'' he said. ``We've brought core Democratic
issues to the fore. When no one was talking about the 44 million
Americans without health insurance, we gave voice to the voiceless.
When no one was talking about the 13 children who die every day of
gun violence we heard their cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has so fizzled that even on his signature issue, health
care, voters were more likely to say that the vice president had
the preferable plan. The sweep of Gore's triumph allows him to move
more quickly to patch up relations with Bradley's backers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was not as pronounced. The polls of voters
Tuesday, conducted by a consortium of the television networks and
the Associated Press, found that Bush and McCain continued to draw
from far different bases of support. Republicans backed Bush
overwhelmingly while independents and Democrats, in states where
they could vote for a Republican, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The victors in each state depended largely on the proportion of
independents and Republicans in the electorate. In Ohio, for
example, more than seven in 10 voters described themselves as
Republicans and seven in 10 of them voted for Bush. By contrast, in
Massachusetts, nearly six in 10 of the voters described themselves
as independents, and seven in 10 of them backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that either candidate had cut into the
other's constituency. Those who described themselves as
conservatives, and those who want abortion to be illegal, voted for
Bush; those calling themselves moderates or liberals, as well as
those who favor abortion rights, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While the days leading up to Tuesday's primaries have been
dominated by McCain's repudiation of religious right leaders and
Bush's apology for his much-ridiculed appearance at Bob Jones
University _ an institution that is viewed as anti-Catholic _ there
was no sign in the exit polls that those episodes significantly
affected the voting. Bush held his own among Catholics, although he
did not do as well with them as with other groups.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain's attacks on the religious right appeared to be a
mistaken gambit _ or one that did not yield him new support among
more moderate voters. In New York and Ohio, people who said
McCain's criticisms mattered backed Bush; those who said they did
not matter backed McCain. In New York, six in 10 voters said
McCain's outspoken comments did not affect their vote; in Ohio,
nearly half said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who was harshly
attacked by McCain, said Tuesday night that he had been
``absolutely dumbfounded when Senator McCain had come to my home
town and launched that barrage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to destroy his campaign, and I didn't know
why he did it,'' he said in an interview with the Fox News Channel.
``To attack 25, 30 percent of your base just isn't smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he was opposed to a Bush-McCain ticket. Asked
whether he thought such an alliance were out of the question, he
replied, ``I really think so. That kind of anger, the concept that
there are people who are agents of evil, that kind of thing isn't
civility in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case throughout the contest, voters said they
were more concerned about candidates' morals than about issues.
While McCain was widely seen as someone who stands up for his
beliefs and tells people the truth, Bush was seen as having high
moral values.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio and Missouri, two pivotal battlegrounds in the fall,
Bush did extraordinarily well. In those states, Bush won the
backing of men and women, the young and old, voters who are
educated and those who are not, and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, where a quarter of the Republican electorate is
Catholic, Bush drew half their vote and McCain took just under
half. In Missouri, where Catholics account for a quarter of the
vote, more than half favored Bush and less than four in 10 backed
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nationwide sweep was especially welcome for him since his
campaign has endured its share of traumas. While Gore has been
elected to two terms as vice president and served in the House and
Senate from Tennessee for 16 years, he was not prepared for
Bradley's sudden emergence last year. That led him to dramatically
retool his campaign from top to bottom, shifting his campaign
headquarters from Washington to Nashville, distancing himself from
President Clinton and significantly loosening up his style on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was unrelenting in finding holes in Bradley's
record and in his proposals _ and put Bradley on the defensive for
several weeks before the former senator responded.
</P>
<P>
   The voters Tuesday gave Bradley high marks for saying what was
on his mind regardless of the political price he might pay; they
viewed Gore as more of a panderer.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bradley had little backing anywhere among any
demographic group and failed to leave his mark in any significant
way.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Republicans, Democrats said they were more
concerned with a candidate's standing on the issues than his
personal qualities. In a sign that the Clinton impeachment hearings
may still loom, Clinton was seen as doing a good job by more than
eight in 10 of the Democrats who voted. But only one in four rated
him favorably as a person.

BUSH WINS MORE DELEGATES IN SUPER SHOWING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Optional ending included) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush of Texas scored solid delegate victories across
the country Tuesday, making it all but impossible for the flagging
insurgent John McCain to deny him the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cruised to victory in delegate battles in California, Ohio,
Maryland, Missouri and Georgia, and appeared to have won more
delegates than McCain in the hard-fought battle in New York, the
second biggest prize on the richest day of primary voting in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had scattered successes and strong showings in the more
liberal Northeast, including victories in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island and Vermont, a state where a flood of
Democrats and independents outnumbered Republicans in the GOP
primary. But Bush denied McCain a New England sweep by winning
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, watching returns early in the evening at the Governor's
Mansion in Austin, Texas, seemed to shy away from claiming the role
as the Republicans' presumptive nominee. But he warmed to the job
in a statement to a victory party in an Austin hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a national victory,'' Bush said. ``Republicans and
conservatives from all across America have said they want me to
lead the Republican Party to victory come November, and I am ready
and eager to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, speaking to supporters in Los Angeles, was equivocal
about the future of his campaign, saying he and Bush ``may meet
again'' soon in future primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would ``take a little time to reflect on the
direction'' of his effort, which has been an attempt not only to
win the nomination but also to reshape the Republican Party as an
agent of political reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's statement came eight months to the day before the general
election in which he hopes to be the Republican to return the White
House to GOP hands after eight years of Democrat Bill Clinton and
his vice president, Al Gore, who became the presumptive Democratic
nominee by winning every contest Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon our party will unite and turn to the main task at hand _
ending the era of Clinton and Gore,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone will make history this November. Either we will ratify
the status quo, or we will have a new beginning in American
politics. I say: America must not give Clinton-Gore a third term.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the evening, McCain said he was ``optimistic that this
trend'' from New England would continue, but his hopes were dashed
when Bush's victory built as the vote-counting rolled west.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does it appear that we'll win an overwhelming number
of delegates, it also appears we'll achieve a few surprises,'' said
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Based on early returns and exit polls, the Texas governor
appeared to escape embarrassment by narrowly beating the Arizona
senator in the non-binding but perceptually important ``beauty
contest'' ballot in California that was open to all voters.
</P>
<P>
   Former Reagan administration official Alan Keyes remains in the
race but was not a major factor in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred thirteen delegates to the Republican National
Convention were at stake, by Associated Press calculations, and
Bush appeared on track to claim the lion's share, including the 162
in California's winner-take-all delegate battle.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the 170 delegates he had before Tuesday, that left
Bush in a much stronger position than McCain to eventually run up
the 1,034 needed to secure the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Other delegate counts put Bush far closer to the magic number
already.
</P>
<P>
   McCain must now decide if he will press on; and, if he does,
what is his rationale in the face of Bush's mounting delegate
count.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has scheduled campaign stops later this week in Colorado
and Illinois but not before stopping Wednesday at his vacation home
in Cottonwood, Ariz., where he is expected to discuss his future
plans with senior campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
   Some aides were prepared to tell McCain to pull the plug before
criticism mounts from party leaders that a continued campaign will
do nothing but soften Bush up for the contest against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign gave McCain plenty of room to maneuver but its
view of what should happen was unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be up to Senator McCain to decide how to proceed,''
Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, McCain and top aides had cast Tuesday's mass of
primaries as decisive, but over the weekend he backed off and said
he might be looking as much for momentum as for a string of
victories over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But without the victories, momentum may be hard to come by,
especially when coupled with next week's concentration of Sun Belt
primaries, including Texas and Florida, where Bush's brother Jeb is
governor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain not only faces a treacherous calendar but a shrinking
bank account. Because he has accepted federal matching funds,
McCain can only lay out about $4 million more before hitting the
$40 million primary spending cap.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, because he has not accepted federal funding in the
primary, can raise and spend unlimited amounts until the Republican
National Convention at Philadelphia that begins in late July. He
had raised a record $70 million and spent $50 million through the
end of January.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's strong showing in most of the big states was based on his
appeal to traditional Republicans, especially religious
conservatives who were likely perturbed by McCain's recent attacks
on movement leaders such as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, despite his cross-party appeal, has ruled out an
independent or third-party presidential candidacy. But his strength
with voters dissatisfied with how government is performing was one
of the reeds he clung to as the size of his loss became apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly our message of reform has had a powerful impact,''
McCain said in a statement issued early in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The voting, which amounted to a national primary, came at the
end of six weeks of back-and-forth victories.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, long the GOP establishment's favorite, was the easy victor
in the season-opening Iowa caucuses, where McCain did not mount a
serious campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Next came New Hampshire, where McCain had camped for months and
scored a big victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rebounded in South Carolina, only to tumble to McCain three
days later in Michigan, where a majority of voters in the
Republican primary were actually Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Again Bush bounced back last week with a triple victory in
Virginia, North Dakota and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign said Tuesday that the Federal Communications
Commission had launched an inquiry into television commercials
aired recently by Dallas multimillionaires Charles and Sam Wyly in
support of Bush's campaign under the banner of Republicans for
Clean Air.
</P>
<P>
   McCain operatives contend that the commercials, when delivered
to the stations, did not conform to FCC regulations because they
did not disclose the Wylys' financial backing for the spots.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the fervent backing of New York's Republican
establishment, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas wrestled his way to
victory Tuesday over John McCain in a state that had once seemed
fertile ground for the senator from Arizona. Bush won a solid
majority of both the delegates and the total Republican votes in
the state's first contested presidential primary since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, New York: You have just pushed George W. Bush
over the top to be the next president of the United States,'' Gov.
George Pataki of New York declared at a victory rally in Manhattan,
looking visibly relieved as he celebrated an outcome on which
Pataki arguably had as much riding as Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, a presidential primary that had
uncustomarily been almost lost in the shadow of the Republican
fight fizzled to an end, as Vice President Al Gore swamped Bill
Bradley in a state where Bradley, too, once thought he had a real
opportunity to derail a candidate backed by the party
establishment. Bradley did not even wait for half the votes to be
counted, appearing before a somber audience of supporters in
Manhattan to both concede and signal his imminent withdrawal from
his race.
</P>
<P>
   The results in the Republican primary in New York offered a
dramatic conclusion to a political struggle that in the space of
two weeks revealed strains not only in the national Republican
Party, as Bush and McCain engaged in pitched and personal battle on
the state's airwaves, but in New York's Republican organization as
well. The differences in New York were at least momentarily set
aside in victory Tuesday night, as Pataki appeared on stage with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had scorned Pataki for guiding a Bush
campaign in New York that was based on attacking McCain's voting
record.
</P>
<P>
   By initial indications, at least, that strategy _ combined with
a Republican primary system designed to help the candidate backed
by the party establishment _ appears to have served Bush well. A
series of public polls over the past few days suggested that
McCain, who presented himself as a moderate, was tied with Bush in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The final result was not that close. In New York, Republicans
vote not for candidates but for 93 delegates. With 42 percent of
the precincts counted last night, Bush had 67 delegates, compared
to 11 for McCain. A third candidate, Alan Keyes, had not won any
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   A tally of the popular vote found that with 94 percent of the
districts counted, Bush had 50 percent of the votes cast for

Forbes, whose name remained on the ballot, even though he has
withdrawn from the race, 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The percentages reflect the number of votes cast for delegates
supporting each candidate, and Republicans could select up to three
delegates.

   McCain did better in New York City suburbs and wealthy areas of
the city than Bush, with McCain apparently winning four of the six
delegates in Suffolk County, according to the state Board of
Elections. In fact, a war horse of Republican politics in New York,
state Sen. Roy Goodman of the Upper East Side, lost in his bid to
become one of Bush's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   New York was the second-largest of the states holding primaries
Tuesday, and one in which Bush's strength had long been suspect.
The stakes were particularly high in the state for Pataki and the
state Republican Party, which had orchestrated a tough campaign
against McCain, first attempting, without success, to keep McCain
off the New York ballot, and then orchestrating a series of attacks
on McCain that many Republicans, including Giuliani, described as
overly negative.
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions of Bush's win was seized as something of a
vindication by Pataki and his aides, who made no effort to hide
their feelings at the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, I'm relieved,'' Pataki confessed after leaving the
stage. ``This was a tough one.'' His chief strategist, Zenia Mucha,
said that in watching the exit polls during the day, which
suggested at times suggested a dead heat, ``I must have died a
thousand deaths.'' Mucha made the sign of the cross as she made the
remark.

</P>
<P>
   The vote brought an end to hectic contest that offered the world
a detailed glimpse at the complexity of a New York election system
designed, in ways obvious and not, to help incumbents and the party
leaders, which was to the clear benefit of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The first manifestation of this came when Bush's main supporters
in New York, Pataki and William D. Powers, the state Republican
chairman, marshaled obscure portions of New York's restrictive
election law to try to keep McCain from appearing on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy collapsed when a judge ordered the ballot opened up
to McCain and other Republican challengers. But once McCain won
that battle, a new one emerged in the form of the convoluted way in
which the Republican Party conducts its primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a statewide vote on the candidates _ the customary
way elections are conducted in the nation _ Republicans cast their
votes in 31 congressional districts, and not for the candidates
themselves, but the three delegates and three alternates pledged to
them. The candidates' names appeared in tiny type under the names
of the delegates who, in Bush's case, tended to be well-known
elected officials selected to run by the state Republican machine.
Aside from the 93 delegates, party leaders select another eight
at-large delegates.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Democratic vote was much more clear-cut, with
the names of Bradley and Gore appearing in bold type at the top of
the ballot, followed by the names of their delegates.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The system was applauded by Bush's supporters, who said it
provided the Texas governor a major tactical advantage over McCain.
Whether or not that was true, it proved to be a matter of
frustration to Republicans, who found that the simple act of voting
for their preferred candidate was anything but easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insane!'' declared Joseph Goldman, 55 of Great Neck, flipping
his eye glasses off and on as he strained to figure out how to vote
for McCain. ``This was just horrific. I never in my life saw
anything like this. You had to look at at this itsy bitsy print.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are asking you to vote for the delegates for each
candidate but I never heard of the delegates,'' he said, adding:
``The candidates are in 6-point type.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to turn the machine to Bush's advantage, Pataki
and his advisers also orchestrated a campaign of attacks on McCain,
highlighting votes he took in Congress that might prove unpopular
with New Yorkers in mailings and radio advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   McCain repeatedly attacked the tactics employed by Bush in New
York as unfair and distortive, and exit polls found that a slight
majority of Republicans thought that Bush spent more time attacking
his opponent than explaining what he wanted to do. And in
interviews, several New Yorkers said they were concerned both with
how Bush conducted his campaign, and particularly with Pataki's
role in trying to keep McCain off the ballot.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I was all behind Pataki until that happened,'' said Norman A.
Ernst Jr., who added that he had once liked Bush but ended up
voting for McCain. ``This is the most undemocratic thing that can
be done. It's upsetting to me when the Republicans espouse very
democratic principles and here they are trying to keep McCain off
the ballot and there being this confusion on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey of voters leaving the polls found that the patterns
that had shaped the Republican primaries across the nation these
past six weeks continued in New York. Among registered Republicans,
those who identified themselves as conservatives supported Bush,
while those who said they were moderate or liberal supported
McCain. Only registered Republicans were allowed to vote in the
Republican primary in New York.

NOW, GORE AND BUSH CAN CONCENTRATE ON EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, there were enough sweet victories Tuesday night so that
they could begin to focus on running against each other in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Each planned to treat his primary rival with respect to unify
his party. But neither worried about losing the nomination anymore.
</P>
<P>
   They have been toughened by a primary campaign that replaced a
mere party coronation. They now can try to correct some things,
like Bush's swing toward his party's right after losing in New
Hampshire. But there are also matters they can do little or nothing
about, like Gore's embarrassing fund-raising appearance at a
Buddhist temple in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has particular reason to worry about voters who supported
Sen. John McCain. A poll of voters in California Tuesday showed
that of those who voted for McCain in the Republican primary, about
two-fifths planned to desert the Republican Party and vote for Gore
in the fall. Only a handful of the Democratic primary voters who
backed Bradley expected to defect from Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   The first steps toward courting the voters for McCain and, on
the Democratic side, Sen. Bill Bradley, were taken Tuesday night
when the victors praised the men who had made their lives
difficult. Gore said in Nashville, Tenn., that Bradley was a ``good
man for whom I have great respect.'' He said, ``Anybody who has
heard Bill Bradley throughout this campaign has come away from the
experience moved and touched by the strength of his commitment to
healing the divisions in our country, especially divisions based on
race.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges to Bush are more obvious. While the campaign
answered, in the affirmative, one question about him _ whether he
could take a punch _ it dislodged him from the stance he had taken
at the start of his campaign: that of the ``compassionate
conservative'' who could get votes from Hispanics and
African-Americans, the practical reformer who could offer something
different from ideology-bound congressional Republicans,
</P>
<P>
   Just on Monday, Bush tried to mend the tears in that robe,
speaking out for tolerance and softening his opposition to talking
to gay Republicans. But the necessity of winning in South Carolina
a few weeks ago forced a dependence in his campaign on the
Christian right, which scares suburban Republicans, whom the Gore
campaign can be expected to keep reminding of that link.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Bush went back to the message of his announcement
speech last summer, saying in his advance text, ``This campaign has
had a cause, a vision of change for our party and our country.
Republicans must expand our prosperity, and extend it to those who
still struggle. We must be a strong nation that also cares for the
weak and forgotten. We must welcome the new Americans _ Americans
by choice _ because legal immigration is not a source of national
weakness, it is a sign of national success. We are a party of
principle. We must also be a party of inclusion _ a party with a
gracious heart and an open door.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was drawn to the left by Bradley's challenge, that
challenge involved no dramatic political change; and, except for
Gore's opposition to current military policy on gay soldiers,
nothing that Bush could really attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley challenge to Gore came earlier than the McCain run
at Bush. That gave the vice president the chance to sharpen his
approach last fall, and not, like Bush, in the heat of the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Another need Bush has is to broaden the structure of his
campaign to include both non-Texans and Republicans with national
experience. His is a campaign that has not looked smooth while
winning. The Bush campaign ignored the traditional style of open
campaigning in New Hampshire, where McCain won in a landslide, and
squandered its huge financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began Tuesday night to hammer Gore over the Buddhist-temple
and other campaign-finance irregularities, saying in his prepared
text, ``I will remind Al Gore that Americans do not want a White
House where there is no controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore started on the obvious counterstrategy by saying,
``I've learned from my mistakes.'' His hope is that the public will
tire of the subject and prefer to consider the Clinton years in
terms of a booming economy. The Gore campaign knows that it has
been many decades since voters have thrown out the party in power
in good economic times.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign is hoping that this year will be
different, and that dismay over Clinton's personal behavior will
lead the public, as Bush put it, to deny ``Clinton-Gore a third
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have one other problem in common, the risk of
overconfidence. ``We've got to pretend that we're behind,'' said
one Gore ally.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the problem may be more severe for Gore than for Bush
because the vice president's manner of explaining things _ oh, so
patiently _already carries an air of condescension.

TROJANS WELCOME PALMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC opens spring football practice Thursday, and
all eyes will be on sophomore quarterback Carson Palmer, who is
returning after missing nine games with a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's return could be one reason the Trojans are opening
practice earlier than ever, although USC coach Paul Hackett said he
also started sooner because he has so many new assistant coaches
who need to become familiar with the personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the big news of spring figures to be how quickly Palmer can
come back from his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been throwing on his own and feels good,'' Hackett said.
``I think there will still be a fatigue factor. I anticipate a
reduction in his reps the first two days and then using him for
full reps on our third practice, which will be March 23rd.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Position changes:Several players have been moved on defense.
Starting free safety Ife Ohalete has moved to strong safety.
Linebacker Sultan Abdul-Malik has returned to defensive end, and
defensive end Kori Dickerson is playing strongside linebacker, the
position formerly occupied by Abdul-Malik.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sitting out spring: Linebacker Markus Steele, who had
shoulder surgery in December, will not participate in contact
drills during spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way we'll put him in a contact situation,''
Hackett said. ``There's a lot of things he can do without putting
on pads.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Steele, the outside-linebacker spot will be occupied by
Daryl Knight, Henry Wallace and JC transfer John Cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Also missing spring practice are tailback Petros Papadakis, who
is recovering from a broken foot, and defensive back Antuan
Simmons, who had back surgery in November.
</P>
<P>
   __ Michels returns: Former USC offensive lineman John Michels,
who played for the Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers and on the
1996 Rose Bowl championship team, has been hired as a graduate
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   __ True freshman to play: Hackett mentioned that offensive
lineman Joe McGuire, tight end Alex Holmes and strong safety Matt
Grootegoed would all play next season.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing possibility is that Grootegoed could be used
in some situations as a tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an argument this morning about whether we could do
that,'' Grootegoed said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Spring dates: The Trojans will practice March 9, 10, 23, 24,
25, 28, 30, 31, April 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   USC will hold scrimmages on March 31 and April 8, with another
to be determined. All practices are open to the public.

EXCERPTS FROM GORE'S REMARKS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a speech by Vice President Al Gore
on Tuesday night at his campaign headquarters in Nashville, Tenn.,
as transcribed by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   I want to thank all of you who are here and all those across
America who have stood with us and helped to bring us this moment.
This is your victory, too. And I want to say something to _ I want
to say something to a good man for whom I have great respect,
Senator Bill Bradley and Ernestine Bradley and to their supporters.
I received a very gracious telephone call from him a few moments
ago, and I appreciate that. I think that anybody who has heard Bill
Bradley throughout this campaign has come away from the experience
moved and touched by the strength of his commitment to healing the
divisions in our country, especially divisions based on race. He
believes in this healing heart and soul. I share his commitment to
it. I have learned from his passion for it. Tonight I salute
Senator Bill Bradley and Ernestine Bradley, his wife.
</P>
<P>
   In this primary campaign so far, I have never taken a single
vote for granted. Those traveling with me can attest to that fact
and in the weeks and months ahead I never will. I know that I have
to work for your vote. I want to earn your vote. And so tonight I
want to reach out to all who believe that this is the time for
great progress, for great reforms, for an America of tolerance and
high ideals. We stand at a mountaintop moment in our history, the
longest period of economic growth this nation has ever known. Under
President Clinton, almost 21 million new jobs. Welfare reform,
crime down. We're putting 100,000 new police on our streets. More
Americans are safer, more Americans have hope. America is strong,
prosperous, at peace in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But while we are here are to celebrate great victories, I say to
you tonight, and hear me well _ you ain't seen nothing yet. Our
fight has just begun. Our fight for the working families of this
country has just begun and tonight I invite all Americans who seek
the best America, all Americans regardless of party to join us in
this cause. We need to build on our record of prosperity. We don't
need to go back to where we were eight years ago. They tried their
approach before. It produced a triple-dip recession and quadrupled
the national debt. If you don't want to go back to that then join
us now. Our campaign is your cause.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in common-sense, affordable tax cuts to help
working families save for college, then join us now. And if you
believe we can invest in our people and still live within our means
and even pay down the national debt, then join us now. Because our
campaign is your cause.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in using our prosperity wisely to lift our nation
up, not wasting the surplus on a risky tax scheme, then join us.
</P>
<P>
   . . .
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in setting aside enough of the surplus to
safeguard Social Security and strengthen Medicare, then join us
now. Join us, our campaign is your cause. Join us to secure health
care as a fundamental right to cover every single child in the next
four years, to move forward step by step to universal coverage. And
then pass a new program of medicoverage so that all of our seniors
will have the financial help they need to purchase the prescription
drugs that their doctors prescribe for them. Join us to pass a
patients' bill of rights so medical decisions are made not by
insurance company accountants or HMO bureaucrats, but by doctors
and nurses and medical professionals. Join us to bring
revolutionary improvements to education, investing more but also
demanding more. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And if you believe in a just and tolerant society and not the
politics of division, I say join us now. And to those Republicans
and independents out there whose heroes are Theodore Roosevelt and
Abraham Lincoln, to all of you I say as well, join with us. Our
campaign is now your cause.

ONLINE VOTING FALLS SHORT OF PERFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JON KAMMAN AND LISA CHIU  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - The world's first legally binding online election
arrived far from perfect Tuesday, March 7. But when it worked
right, thousands of Democrats were casting ballots as fast as one
every five seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But many would-be voters encountered roadblocks along the
Internet pathway of picking a presidential nominee. And when the
sought assistance, they found telephone help lines constantly busy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by 10 p.m. Tuesday, March 7, 22 hours into the first of
four days of remote online voting, more than 13,000 votes had been
recorded by Election.com, the private firm conducting the election
for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials expect the start-up bugs to be wiped out
quickly, and additional phone lines will be installed to help those
struggling with the technology. They expect about half of the
primary votes to be cast online, possibly more than 50,000,
although turnout could fall if Bill Bradley withdraws this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you're engaged in a project of this magnitude, and
you're beginning to forge ahead a new path in technology, there's
always going to be a few bumps in the road,'' said Bill Taylor,
vice president of sales for Election.com. ``We've been doing our
best to smooth them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet votes streamed in at a rate of 20 a minute at one
point, party Vice Chairman David Eagle said.
</P>
<P>
   One common complaint among first-day voters was an inability to
access the two Web sites where electronic ballots are available _
www.election.com and www.azdem.org.
</P>
<P>
   The sites sometimes loaded so slowly that computers ``timed
out,'' said Mark Strama, a company executive overseeing technical
aspects of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Other voters were thwarted because they did not receive or had
not saved the mailed personal identification number that every
Democrat needed in order to vote.
</P>
<P>
   One unhappy voter told The Republic she encountered a blank
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Another, describing himself as a casual computer user, was
bewildered by a message saying that for him to vote, ``your
computer needs to have cookies enabled,'' a reference to allowing
the Web site to install a small piece of information on the user's
computer. The ``cookie'' would be erased when the voter logged out,
the notice said.
</P>
<P>
   Phone lines to state Democratic headquarters in Phoenix were
swamped all day, and the toll-free number set up on the eve of
voting also produced a busy signal for many callers.
</P>
<P>
   Party and company officials said 10 more lines were to be
installed overnight, supplementing the 13 at party headquarters
handling calls coming in to (602) 298-4200.
</P>
<P>
   More lines also were ordered for the toll-free line,
1-877-377-8683, which rings in a call center in Texas, Taylor said.
He did not have a count of the calls handled.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said start-up bugs should largely disappear as online
voting continues. Balloting from remote locations will end at 11:59
p.m. Friday, March 10, but 124 polling places will be open from 10
a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One non-computer glitch related to early voting was that
employees at least two Phoenix area sites knew nothing about being
named among six early voting sites locally for minorities. The
sites had agreed to serve as polling places on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Isaac School District Welcome Center, which serves mainly
the Latino community in west-central Phoenix, secretary Debbie Diaz
said several would-be voters were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Leaflets listed the center as an early voting site, but ``we
have no idea why,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having voting on Saturday only,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At least four people were turned away at the Roosevelt Community
Technology Center at Seventh Street and Southern Avenue in south
Phoenix.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore crushed their
rivals from ocean to ocean Tuesday in powerful displays that
assured them their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   After claiming the two biggest electoral powerhouses of
California and New York, which account for more than 40 percent of
the delegates chosen Tuesday, Bush and Gore immediately turned to
each other _ and to firing the first salvos of the general election
campaign that lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victories over former Sen. Bill Bradley were particularly
impressive because he was supported by a majority of every
demographic group in the 16 states with Democratic contests, and,
significantly, by women, who backed him in some states by margins
of more than 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   In several states Gore held a margin of 3-to-1 or better. Gore
also racked up a double-digit margin in New York, a victory made
even sweeter by the memory of his dismal performance in the 1988
presidential primary, where he won a paltry 10 percent and quit the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not win one state, a defeat so pronounced that his
advisers said it was only a matter of days before he withdraws.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican verdict Tuesday was decisive, though not as
overwhelming. Bush prevailed over Sen. John McCain by comfortable
margins in California and New York, as well as in Ohio and Missouri
and in the only southern state voting Tuesday, Georgia. McCain
captured four relatively small New England states: Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Gore and Bush victories in California, the most
sought-after electoral prize of all, it was not clear which of the
four contenders would prevail in that state's popular vote, which
is not binding but could be a telling measure of a candidates'
potency in November.
</P>
<P>
   Before the outcome was certain in some states, Bush declared to
supporters in Austin, Texas, that ``we have good news from sea to
shining sea'' and laid out several themes for the general election
in a combative speech that was mostly devoted to lambasting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is celebrating victory as well,'' Bush said,
struggling to contain a satisfied grin. ``I congratulate him and
look forward to the contest. He is the candidate of the status quo
in Washington, D.C., and he has a tough case to make in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``American must not give Clinton/Gore four more years,'' he
said, reciting a list of ills of the current administration. And,
pointedly, he raised Gore's fund-raising troubles, saying, ``I will
remind Al Gore that Americans do not want a White House where there
is no controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   At a boisterous rally in Nashville earlier in the evening, Gore
praised Bradley, saying he was ``moved and touched'' by his rival's
commitment to healing racial divisions.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Bush, he quickly looked to the general election,
calling on the Republican nominee to debate him twice a week, spurn
unregulated soft money donations and appear with him at open
meetings around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will challenge the Republican nominee to hold joint open
meetings with me,'' he said, ``to make this contest of ideas and
not insults, a campaign conducted in full daylight and not through
secretly funded special interest attack ads or smear telephone
calls from the extremist right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also put forth an unvarnished plea for the
independents and Republicans who backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore did not mention Bush by name, he depicted the
Republicans as intolerant. ``In this election, we are the party of
the mainstream,'' he said. ``We are the party of hope. We appeal to
hope, not anger, not to exclusion. We look to the future, not the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday night, Gore had begun concentrating his
assaults on Bush, while the Texas governor has softened his
conservative oratory in recent days, positioning himself for the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   The voting Tuesday was tantamount to a national primary. Never
before have so many states, in every region, held contests on the
same day. Roughly a third of the delegates to the parties' national
conventions were up for grabs. The Democrat needs 2,170 delegates
to get the party's nomination; the Republican needs 1,034.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side the primaries capped the most contentious
nomination battle in decades, a week-by-week electoral see-saw in
which Bush would win one round, only to be humbled by McCain in the
next. Bush entered Tuesday's voting with more victories and more
delegates. But no one could safely bet what would happen because in
the entire yearlong run-up to the primaries, Bush had been widely
viewed as the front-runner, only to see his prospects grow far more
precarious after McCain trounced him in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But McCain, of Arizona, vowed not to give up, asserting in a
brief speech at a late rally in West Hollywood: ``Our crusade
continues, tonight, tommorow, the next day, the day after that and
for as long as it takes to restore America's confidence and pride
in the practice and institutions of our great democracy.''  &UR;  &LR;  His
advisers said they and McCain would retreat to Arizona to decide
whether the senator should pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race was far less climactic Tuesday because while
Bradley emerged as a threat last fall _ polls at one point had him
beating Gore in New Hampshire _ that spurt of popularity never
translated to the voting booth. Bradley, a former senator from New
Jersey, was shut out by Gore in every contest before Tuesday.
Bradley's campaign had so sputtered that even before the voting
Tuesday, many of his most prominent supporters said it would take a
miracle for him to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At a subdued gathering in Manhattan Tuesday night, Bradley said
he had called the vice president to congratulate him _ and he
insisted that his campaign was a worthy crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our lack of victory tonight, we've shaped the national
debate in this campaign,'' he said. ``We've brought core Democratic
issues to the fore. When no one was talking about the 44 million
Americans without health insurance, we gave voice to the voiceless.
When no one was talking about the 13 children who die every day of
gun violence we heard their cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has so fizzled that even on his signature issue, health
care, voters were more likely to say that the vice president had
the preferable plan. The sweep of Gore's triumph allows him to move
more quickly to patch up relations with Bradley's backers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was not as pronounced. The polls of voters
Tuesday, conducted by a consortium of the television networks and
the Associated Press, found that Bush and McCain continued to draw
from far different bases of support. Republicans backed Bush
overwhelmingly while independents and Democrats, in states where
they could vote for a Republican, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The victors in each state depended largely on the proportion of
independents and Republicans in the electorate. In Ohio, for
example, more than seven in 10 voters described themselves as
Republicans and seven in 10 of them voted for Bush. By contrast, in
Massachusetts, nearly six in 10 of the voters described themselves
as independents, and seven in 10 of them backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that either candidate had cut into the
other's constituency. Those who described themselves as
conservatives, and those who want abortion to be illegal, voted for
Bush; those calling themselves moderates or liberals, as well as
those who favor abortion rights, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While the days leading up to Tuesday's primaries have been
dominated by McCain's repudiation of religious right leaders and
Bush's apology for his much-ridiculed appearance at Bob Jones
University _ an institution that is viewed as anti-Catholic _ there
was no sign in the exit polls that those episodes significantly
affected the voting. Bush held his own among Catholics, although he
did not do as well with them as with other groups.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain's attacks on the religious right appeared to be a
mistaken gambit _ or one that did not yield him new support among
more moderate voters. In New York and Ohio, people who said
McCain's criticisms mattered backed Bush; those who said they did
not matter backed McCain. In New York, six in 10 voters said
McCain's outspoken comments did not affect their vote; in Ohio,
nearly half said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who was harshly
attacked by McCain, said Tuesday night that he had been
``absolutely dumbfounded when Senator McCain had come to my home
town and launched that barrage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to destroy his campaign, and I didn't know
why he did it,'' he said in an interview with the Fox News Channel.
``To attack 25, 30 percent of your base just isn't smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he was opposed to a Bush-McCain ticket. Asked
whether he thought such an alliance were out of the question, he
replied, ``I really think so. That kind of anger, the concept that
there are people who are agents of evil, that kind of thing isn't
civility in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case throughout the contest, voters said they
were more concerned about candidates' morals than about issues.
While McCain was widely seen as someone who stands up for his
beliefs and tells people the truth, Bush was seen as having high
moral values.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio and Missouri, two pivotal battlegrounds in the fall,
Bush did extraordinarily well. In those states, Bush won the
backing of men and women, the young and old, voters who are
educated and those who are not, and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, where a quarter of the Republican electorate is
Catholic, Bush drew half their vote and McCain took just under
half. In Missouri, where Catholics account for a quarter of the
vote, more than half favored Bush and less than four in 10 backed
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nationwide sweep was especially welcome for him since his
campaign has endured its share of traumas. While Gore has been
elected to two terms as vice president and served in the House and
Senate from Tennessee for 16 years, he was not prepared for
Bradley's sudden emergence last year. That led him to dramatically
retool his campaign from top to bottom, shifting his campaign
headquarters from Washington to Nashville, distancing himself from
President Clinton and significantly loosening up his style on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was unrelenting in finding holes in Bradley's
record and in his proposals _ and put Bradley on the defensive for
several weeks before the former senator responded.
</P>
<P>
   The voters Tuesday gave Bradley high marks for saying what was
on his mind regardless of the political price he might pay; they
viewed Gore as more of a panderer.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bradley had little backing anywhere among any
demographic group and failed to leave his mark in any significant
way.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Republicans, Democrats said they were more
concerned with a candidate's standing on the issues than his
personal qualities. In a sign that the Clinton impeachment hearings
may still loom, Clinton was seen as doing a good job by more than
eight in 10 of the Democrats who voted. But only one in four rated
him favorably as a person.

McCAIN'S MAVERICK STYLE MAY HAVE COST HIM WITH REPUBLICAN VOTERS 
 
(Eds.: This is an analysis) 
(Eds.: Story has been updated) 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ John McCain's ``great ride'' for the
White House was sputtering Tuesday, largely because his maverick,
reform-oriented campaign still appeals more to independents and
Democrats than to his fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Arizona senator has spoiled early Republican front-runner
George W. Bush's ``coronation,'' and he was reluctant to throw in
the towel. But McCain's anti-establishment message hasn't caught
fire with most GOP voters, and speculation increased late Tuesday
that he would drop out of the presidential race before the end of
the week.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   McCain's history as a political renegade _ he likes to brag at
campaign rallies that he never has been voted ``Miss Congeniality''
in Washington _ may have been a particularly acute problem in
Tuesday's lineup. The elections were dominated by states, such as
Ohio, with strong Republican traditions or states, such as New York
and California, where only Republicans could vote or where ballots
cast only by Republicans counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stuck his finger in the eye of the (Republican)
establishment, and he did so at a time when they had already made
their choice (of Bush), which only further irritated them,'' said
University of Texas professor Bruce Buchanan, a specialist in
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   And, last week, McCain, never a favorite of many religious
conservatives, alienated even more members of that significant
Republican bloc by branding two major fundamentalist leaders
``agents of intolerance.``
</P>
<P>
   &UR; McCain planned to travel Wednesday to his vacation home in
Cottonwood, Ariz., where he said he would ``take a little time to
reflect'' on his political future.
</P>
<P>
   As the senator was still adding up the numbers late Tuesday
night, his campaign announced that he will campaign in Colorado and
Illinois on Thursday and Friday, in advance of upcoming primaries.
In remarks to supporters, he raised the possibility that he may
continue to fight Bush for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &UR; But McCain fell far short of the 200 delegates that his
strategists had said earlier were the minimum he needed from Super
Tuesday to maintain a realistic chance at the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's losses Tuesday included California's 162 delegates, the
richest nominating prize. Although any voter could cast a ballot in
the California primary, only Republican votes counted toward
delegate selection, and Bush had the strong backing of the state's
GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was hoping to win the most overall votes in the state's
primary in order to claim that he would be the most ``electable''
candidate in California in November. But the Arizona senator's loss
of California's delegates, his loss in Ohio and a
less-than-hoped-for showing in New York may have made California's
so-called ``beauty contest'' moot.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech Tuesday night was much more conciliatory than
the remarks he leveled at Bush after losing the key South Carolina
primary to the Texas governor last month. But the senator assured
his supporters that his ``crusade'' for governmental reform and
efforts to broaden the Republican Party's appeal to all Americans
will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud, so proud, that this message has struck a chord in
the hearts of so many Americans of every race, creed, and political
persuasion in this vast and diverse country,'' he said.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Martha Gibson, a University of Connecticut political scientist,
said McCain needed to reach out to non-Republicans to capture New
Hampshire and Michigan, states with open primaries where his
victories gave momentum to his underdog effort. ``But by doing
that, he certainly offends the traditional power base,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout in Michigan's Republican primary two weeks ago was
more than double what it was four years ago, and at least half of
the voters who cast ballots were Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said McCain's alienation of religious conservatives with
his attacks on Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell may have been a
factor in Tuesday's balloting but probably was not an overriding
one. She made a similar assessment of a TV ad that Bush supporters
ran in New York, Ohio and California, attacking McCain's
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pick off pieces,'' she said. ``I'm not sure either one of
those would be a key piece (by itself).``
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign said it already has spent $200,000 on
advertising in Colorado, which will hold its primary Friday. But
the senator's next major test will be March 14, when he faces a
difficult lineup of states, including Texas, Bush's home state;
Florida, where Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor; and other Southern
states.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll indicated that McCain is competitive in Illinois,
but that state won't hold its primary until March 21.

 &HT;     BUSH BLITZES McCAIN ON SUPER TUESDAY

<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush effectively ended the challenge of
Sen. John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination
Tuesday, setting the stage for Bush to reach out to McCain and his
supporters to join a GOP crusade to reclaim the White House in the
November election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain left open the possibility that he might withdraw after
assessing the disappointing results from what amounted to a
national primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush harnessed hard-hitting campaign ads and a lavishly financed
nationwide campaign organization to sweep most of the 13 states
with GOP contests.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary returns showed Bush beating McCain in New York,
Ohio, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri and Maine. And early returns in
California showed Bush dashing McCain's hopes for a symbolic
victory by capturing the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   Exit surveys showed Bush dominated key winner-take-all delegate
contests, including California, as well as the majority of the GOP
delegates in states that award delegates on a district-by-district
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's campaign manager, said the Texan would pick up
as many as 450 of the 613 Republican delegates chosen on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN delegate projections at 11:30 p.m. EST showed Bush winning
445 delegates on Super Tuesday, giving him a total of 660 since the
2000 contest began. The projections showed McCain picking up 105
for a total of 210 so far. A Republican candidate needs 1,034
delegates to secure the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose fiery populism sustained an uphill challenge for
the last six weeks, captured Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts
and Rhode Island. He did not sweep New England and New York, as he
said he needed to do to sustain his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the 63-year-old former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner
of war make inroads among the bedrock Republican voters who he
needed in order to garner large numbers of delegates in the
district-by-district duels in states such as New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, flanked by his wife Cindy and his family as he addressed
supporters in Los Angeles, said late Tuesday he would ``take stock
of our losses'' and ``take a little time to reflect on the
direction of our capaign'' after returning to Arizona on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain clearly left open the possibility that he may withdraw
from the race by saying that he and Bush ``may meet again'' in
upcoming primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said that no matter what the outcome of his campaign
deliberations, his ``crusade'' of reform will continue unabated for
``as long as it takes to restore America's confidence and pride in
the practices and institutions of our great democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, son of former President George H.W. Bush, made it clear
that his most pressing task in the days ahead will be to court
McCain, and the centrist Republicans, independents and Democrats
who rallied to McCain, in hopes of ending the GOP fratricide that
imperils his chances in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush paid homage to McCain, echoing the Arizonan's message of
reform and publicly praising him. ``We have our disagreements but I
respect him and his commitment to reform,'' Bush said in remarks
prepared for his victory celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, savoring the likely end of his GOP primary struggle,
shifted his attention to Vice President Al Gore, ``the candidate of
the status quo'' who must be defeated because ``America must not
give Clinton-Gore a third term.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign manager signaled that the victor would await
McCain's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not up to us to urge him out of the race,'' Rove said.
``What would be appropriate for us to do is to indicate that
Governor Bush is ready to heal and unify the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove said Bush would only claim victory ``when we get to 1,034
delegates and we're the only candidate left.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary schedule moves into Bush territory next Tuesday,
with contests in six key southern and southwestern states,
including Texas, where he is governor, and Florida where his
brother, Jeb Bush, is chief executive. The six states offer 341
delegates _ enough to give Bush a mathematical lock on the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's hard-hitting populist bid, featuring attacks on Bush,
``the establishment,'' the White House, Congress and special
interests, attracted legions of first-time voters, once-alienated
young voters, independents and Democrats to the GOP banner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candidacy ignited historic turnouts in New Hampshire
and Michigan, where he won early momentum, as well as in South
Carolina where he lost.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers
University, said excitement does not translate into nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a credible early favorite _ and you have the
fortitude to stay on in the face of early disappointments _ you're
going to win the nomination,'' Baker said. ``Ultimately the
favorites designated by the party graybeards walk away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta who is not
working for any presidential campaign, said McCain could not hope
to win the GOP nomination ``without Republican votes,'' adding:
``Establishment matters, and money matters _ especially in a war of
attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which had the support of Republican leaders _
including 29 governors, 38 senators and 175 House members _ carried
out 2 million get-out-the-vote telephone calls in nine states in
the final two days of the Super Tuesday campaign, mailed 2 million
pieces of campaign literature and distributed 69,000 yard signs,
according to Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Baker and Ayres said Bush had been strengthened for the
fall campaign by being forced to grapple with McCain's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has become ``a far superior candidate, far more aggressive,
far more unscripted, far more willing to take chances,'' Ayres
said.

attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which had the support of Republican leaders _
including 29 governors, 38 senators and 175 House members _ carried
out 2 million get-out-the-vote telephone calls in nine states in
the final two days of the Super Tuesday campaign, mailed 2 million
pieces of campaign literature and distributed 69,000 yard signs,
according to Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Baker and Ayres said Bush had been strengthened for the
fall campaign by being forced to grapple with McCain's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has become ``a far superior candidate, far more aggressive,
far more unscripted, far more willing to take chances,'' Ayres
said.

SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE'S INSIDE GAME PUSHES UT-ARLINGTON OUT

<P>
   SAN MARCOS _ UT-Arlington women's basketball team was
controlling the inside against Southwest Texas State, getting the
defensive rebounds and the points.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Mavericks got away from that plan, the Bobcats,
specifically senior Shawn Manning, made them pay.
</P>
<P>
   Manning finished with a game-high 23 points as the Bobcats
knocked off UTA, 70-54, in a first-round game of the Southland
Conference tournament at Strahan Coliseum last night.
</P>
<P>
   UTA (13-15) led 27-26 at halftime. But after a short
conversation at the half _ coach Suzanne Fox clocked it at a minute
and a half _ the Bobcats (18-10) regrouped and dominated the paint
to win their 10th consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   SWT will play Northwestern State at 8 p.m. Friday in Shreveport,
La.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we came out and fought hard, but I thought, in the
second half, they got the ball to the high post \RManning\S ,'' UTA
coach Mike Dean said. ``The first 10 or 15 minutes \Rof the second
half\S, they just threw it in there whenever they wanted. We needed
to do a better job of denying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalila Darez led the Mavs with 18 points and 11 rebounds. Renee
Wharekura, sidelined most of the first half because of a sprained
right ankle, finished with 13. Tasha Campbell scored 10.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, a 6-foot-1 forward, had her way inside in the second
half. The Bobcats, after being outrebounded 23-15 in the first
half, took 22 to UTA's 12 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were beating us on the boards and, really, that's our
stronghold.'' Manning said. ``So, it got us fired up to go out and
make sure we blocked out and did what we had to do to get them off
the boards.''

GORE AND BUSH WIN IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If California's jungle primary was the first big
harbinger of the general election, Al Gore was the king of beasts
Tuesday, finishing first among all contenders listed on the same
blanket ballot regardless of party. But George W. Bush was a close
second, and the overall news for Gore was more good than great,
suggesting an advantage, not a lock, for him in the biggest state
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won the support of just of just over 3 in 10 California
voters overall, while Bush drew just under 3 in 10, John McCain
about one-quarter, and Bill Bradley barely 10 percent, according to
surveys of voters leaving the polls. Fully 20 percent of McCain's
support came from voters who identified themselves as Democrats,
and 30 percent from independents, and 4 in 10 of the Arizona
senator's supporters said they would support Gore in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Those were all positive signs for Gore, as were favorable
ratings 10 percentage points higher than those for Bush and a
15-point advantage among the self-described moderates who made up
almost 40 percent of the electorate here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has made scores of visits to the state in the last
seven years, spoke Tuesday night to a ballroom of supporters by
telephone, saying: ``I can't tell you how important it is to me to
win big in the California Democratic contest and to win the overall
California primary contest. That is a harbinger of things to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore ran well behind his fellow Democrat, Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, who drew the support of nearly 6 in 10 voters in her
race against a split field of contenders for the Republican
nomination to challenge her in November, and Gore just edged Bush
in a hypothetical general election match-up, while McCain ran 10
points ahead of Gore. Half of independent voters said they would
back Gore in the fall, but 4 in 10 favored Bush, and like numbers
said that Gore and Bush were both ``about right'' in terms of
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that Bush will be strong enough to be competitive
here and that there's plenty of time for healing to happen,'' said
Steve Kinney, a longtime Republican pollster here. ``It just shows
you that here in California there's not a lot of love for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one top Democratic strategist agreed, saying on
condition of anonymity: ``My sense of this is Gore did OK, but not
as well as he should have. It scares me that he doesn't have more
oomph on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing conclusions from Tuesday's results here posed particular
hazards, because this was California's first presidential primary
using the blanket ballot, and there were no comparable benchmarks.
All votes counted in the overall horserace, but under major party
rules, only the votes of party members counted toward delegate
selection, a fact that voters themselves seem not to have fully
grasped. Two-thirds of those surveyed said they would consider the
candidate who won the most total votes to be the ``real winner'' of
his party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gore won overwhelmingly among Democrats, taking 6 in 10
Democratic votes to just under 2 in 10 for Bradley, and Bush took
just under 6 in 10 Republicans to fewer than 4 in 10 for McCain,
political professionals in both parties quickly turned their
attention to handicapping the general election, and especially
trying to discern where McCain supporters might go.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters, McCain drew his strongest support from
moderates, those with post-college education, those over 45 years
old, those earning over $100,000 a year, veterans and those who
decided to vote in the last week, a demographic slice much like
those that were crucial to the victories of California's last
Republican governor, Pete Wilson. When those voters were asked who
they would support this fall, Bush ran evenly with Gore among
veterans and those over 45, came close with those earning over
$100,000 and lost the others by margins of roughly 60-to-40.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush loses those people in the fall, he won't even be
competitive in California,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic
consultant. ``That's a group he has to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, McCain was most competitive in the Central
Valley, the vast agricultural swath that runs the interior spine of
the state, which accounted for a quarter of Tuesday's electorate
and often decides statewide elections. Tuesday, McCain, Gore and
Bush each took about 3 in 10 votes there; in the hypothetical fall
contest, Gore and Bush split the area evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers have long contended that he could translate his
appeal in Texas, a fast-growing southwestern state with a booming
high-tech economy, to California, which national Republicans have
not contested vigorously since Bush's father won in 1988. Bush has
also shown strength with Hispanic voters, who make up a growing
part of the electorate but have trended strongly to the Democratic
column in recent years, mostly in a backlash against Wilson's
strong campaigns against affirmative action and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters accounted for about 10 percent of Tuesday's
electorate, and Gore won the votes of 6 in 10, with Bush and McCain
together taking about 3 in 10. In a hypothetical fall match-up,
Bush, who ran television advertisements in Spanish here, drew a
respectable 3 in 10 Hispanic voters, well above recent Republican
statewide showings, compared to two-thirds for Gore. In his victory
speech in Texas Tuesday night, Bush declared: ``Legal immigration
is not a source of national weakness; it is a sign of national
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 6 in 10 Hispanic voters, roughly the same percentage
as the electorate as a whole, supported a successful ballot
initiative to limit marriage to heterosexual couples, which
Democrats opposed by a like margin.
</P>
<P>
   Republican analysts called that a sign of Bush's potential
appeal on an issue of traditional family values.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Ross, a Democratic consultant in Sacramento who has
made a specialty of working with Hispanic candidates, said Bush's
opposition to gun control and abortion rights remained sharply at
odds with Californians' strong support for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what'll happen is Bush will compete in California for
about three weeks, and then we're going to keep talking about guns
and abortion, and he'll leave,'' Ross said. ``Three weeks ago, in
one of the most conservative assembly districts in the state, in
the Central Valley, I asked the following question: ``Do you favor
or oppose the government requiring mandatory registration of all
guns,'' and 73 percent said they favored it.''

STARS NOT BUYING AGING DEFENDERS IN SELLER'S MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been counting down the days until the NHL trade
deadline _ Tuesday _ then you know that the Stars are rumored to be
in the running for acquiring:
</P>
<P>
   A. Doug Gilmour
</P>
<P>
   B. Mark Messier
</P>
<P>
   C. North Dakota
</P>
<P>
   D. the vast thoroughbred empire of Wimp-Free Stables.
</P>
<P>
   In truth _ and some purportedly wise NHL minds may not believe
this _ but the answer could well be none of the above. Owner Tom
Hicks doesn't have a bottomless wallet, though it is a formidably
spacious one. Nor is every $6 million-a-year 39-year-old a perfect
fit for the defending Stanley Cup champion Stars.
</P>
<P>
   News of the latest superstar to swap jerseys for a stretch run
at the Cup _ this time, it was Boston's Ray Bourque going to
Colorado _ did not pass unnoticed at the Stars' compound. But by
the same token, the building yesterday wasn't exactly draped in
black.
</P>
<P>
   For 21 years, granted, Bourque has been a great player, a likely
Hall of Fame player. There were Aprils when some say that he
carried the Bruins single-handedly through the playoffs on his own
back.
</P>
<P>
   But when future Hall of Famers are on the auction block, it's
usually a seller's market. Boston general manager Harry Sinden,
instead of closing on a reported deal with Philadelphia, the team
that was Bourque's first choice, shopped the veteran shamelessly.
Indeed, sources say, he tried to use the Avalanche's offer to help
pry young center Simon Gagne away from the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   When the Flyers had nothing else to barter, Sinden sent Bourque
two time zones and one full conference away. Colorado thinks it
just traded for a sure spot in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' silence, on the other hand, speaks volumes.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars don't need a Ray Bourque. It sounds blasphemous, but
there's no room. No room in Hicks' big wallet, probably, and no
room in the Stars' future.
</P>
<P>
   This team needs goal scorers, not 39-year-old defenders. It
needs somebody to share the offensive load until the aches, pains
and broken bones of this difficult season finally mend.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Bourque's contract will expire at the end of this
season. Detroit, which was also interested, reportedly wanted
Bourque to commit to a two-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars already have a corps of young and/or experienced
defensemen under contract. They need goal scorers. Stop me if
you've heard this before.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL deadline is next week _ hence, the headlines. But the
Stars actually fired a preemptive strike, of sorts, a full month
ago, when they sent Derek Plante and Kevin Dean to Chicago for
defensemen Dave Manson and Sylvain Cote.
</P>
<P>
   As Bourque now tries to fit in with the Avalanche, the way Chris
Chelios and Wendel Clark thought they would do so smoothly in
Detroit a year ago, Manson and Cote have had a four-week head
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the seven to 10 days preceding the March 14 deadline, the
activity usually increases,'' Stars general manager Bob Gainey said
yesterday. ``But my own feeling is that if you can make your change
earlier, it allows time for those players to adapt and adjust to
your team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often they are coming off teams where they haven't been in a
successful situation, and it takes a little while to shake those
cobwebs out.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unspoken by Gainey was something even more important. If
the Stars hadn't grabbed Cote and Manson early, somebody else _ the
Red Wings, probably _ would have.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars need goal scorers. Did I forget to say that?
</P>
<P>
   But as history tells us, this is the time of year when NHL teams
habitually begin to think defense. Every contender thinks things
will be fine, if they can only get another big, nasty,
presence-asserting defenseman _ or two, or three.
</P>
<P>
   It's a seller's market. To get Bourque, the Avalanche gave up a
package of four players, including Sami Pahlsson, a talented young
forward currently playing out his contract in Sweden. He will move
right onto the Flyers' second line next season, reports say.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at trade deadline, Colorado surrendered another part
of its youth to get Theo Fleury from Calgary. When the playoffs
were done, Fleury signed with the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't miss the opportunity if we think there's a place
where we can improve our team,'' Gainey said simply, though
noncommittally.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque, in other words, great as he has been for 21 NHL
seasons, the Stars can do without.
</P>
<P>
   But another goal scorer? By all means.

presence-asserting defenseman _ or two, or three.
</P>
<P>
   It's a seller's market. To get Bourque, the Avalanche gave up a
package of four players, including Sami Pahlsson, a talented young
forward currently playing out his contract in Sweden. He will move
right onto the Flyers' second line next season, reports say.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at trade deadline, Colorado surrendered another part
of its youth to get Theo Fleury from Calgary. When the playoffs
were done, Fleury signed with the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't miss the opportunity if we think there's a place
where we can improve our team,'' Gainey said simply, though
noncommittally.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque, in other words, great as he has been for 21 NHL
seasons, the Stars can do without.
</P>
<P>
   But another goal scorer? By all means.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was no drama in the air as former Sen. Bill
Bradley's supporters began filing into the ballroom at the Sheraton
Hotel in midtown Manhattan Tuesday night. The polls had not even
closed, but they knew what the results would be. They had come to
bid him farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow I'm going to be depressed,'' said Stuart Kolbert, a
real estate broker from Westchester County, who had gone to New
Hampshire five times as a volunteer for Bradley. ``I'm depressed
now.''
</P>
<P>
   But like their candidate, the crowd collectively declared a
proud victory for idealism even as they conceded defeat in all of
Tuesday's primaries to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to walk away from the speech, so I wouldn't start
crying,'' said Susan Levine, 58, the travel agent for the Bradley
campaign. ``I'm so sad the world isn't ready for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing calm and not the least bit sorrowful as he entered the
packed room shortly after 9 p.m., Bradley declared that his long
insurgent campaign, now in its dying moments, had ``shaped the
national debate'' and returned ``core Democratic values'' to the
fore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must remember that the fact that we've not succeeded in
winning tonight's primaries makes the cause no less just, the fight
no less honorable, the goal no less reachable,'' Bradley told the
crowd of several hundred people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have called our goals unrealistic,'' he said. ``I call
them common sense. I call them Democratic. I call them American.
And I'm going to work for them until we win. And we will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bradley said he would spend Wednesday at his home in
Montclair, N.J., resting and calling friends to talk about his
future. They said he was likely to hold a news conference on
Thursday somewhere in New Jersey to announce his withdrawal from
the race.
</P>
<P>
   But even as his supporters were waxing elegiac, Bradley spoke in
soaring tones about how he had brought young and idealistic people
back into politics and had forced a national debate on issues like
campaign finance reform, universal health care and child poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave voice to the voiceless,'' he said. ``When no one was
talking about the 13 children who die every day of gun violence, we
heard their cries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When no one was talking about the nearly 14 million children
who still live in poverty in this country, we said America can't be
America if they remain poor in a time of plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   There is already discussion among some of Bradley's staunchest
supporters about laying the groundwork for a Bradley campaign in
2004. ``There should be some time for mourning, but then it will be
time to go back to work,'' said a friend and informal adviser to
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   But close aides to Bradley said he had given absolutely no
thought to mounting another campaign in four years, and none would
hazard a guess about his intentions. ``I was wrong about his
running this time, so I'm not one to prognosticate,'' said Anita
Dunn, his communications director.
</P>
<P>
   The live rhythm and blues band, the red, white and blue balloons
and the free-flowing wine did little to add a festive air to the
Sheraton ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The news reports all day had been so unrelentingly gloomy that
there was barely a murmur or a groan from the crowd when CNN
projected Gore the winner in New York at precisely the moment the
polls closed at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a sense of deep pride among the people in room,
many of whom said they were first-time political volunteers who had
been drawn into the campaign by Bradley's idealism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good seeds planted and nurtured don't always come up when you
expect them to,'' said Chris Hansen-Nelson, 45, of Manhattan. ``But
they come up eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   At another corner of the room, Kolbert and Ed Gerstein, a
52-year-old accountant from Brooklyn, reminisced like old college
roommates about their volunteer days for Bradley in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really did something good for this country,'' Kolbert said.
``I have to believe we elevated the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Pleasance, a 61-year-old retiree from London who met Bradley
at Oxford University in the mid-1960s, came all the way from
England earlier this year to help the Bradley campaign in Iowa, New
Hampshire and Washington state. He bought a plane ticket to Florida
several weeks ago, planning to help prepare for the March 14
primary there. He'll use it to take a vacation instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't always very good at speaking before large rooms,''
Pleasance said. ``But he really connected with small groups. I only
wish more people had been able to see that.''

BUSH'S REMARKS AFTER SUPER TUESDAY VICTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs to provide more of speech, as delivered)  
 (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is a transcript of remarks Tuesday night by Gov.
George W. Bush, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis, thank you. Thank you for your dedication to our
children. Thank you for your work in one of the most important jobs
in America, teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, we have good news from sea to shining sea. We were
challenged, and we met the challenge. We were tested, and we were
equal to the test. We promised a national campaign. And, tonight,
we have a national victory. Republicans and conservatives across
the country have said they want me to lead the Republican Party to
victory come November, and I am ready and eager to do so.
</P>
<P>
   I commend two good men and tough competitors: Senator John
McCain and Alan Keyes. . This has been a spirited contest. I
congratulate John. We have our disagreements, but I respect him and
I respect his commitment to reform. I congratulate Alan Keyes and
the deep conviction he has brought to this campaign. Soon, our
party will unite and turn to the main task at hand: ending the era
of Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's victory is a testimony to the power and energy of a
new message, a message of reform and renewal called compassionate
conservatism. Tonight's victory is also the beginning of a great
task. I am not only asking Americans to vote for me, I am asking
Americans to join with me on a mission to reform and renew our
great land.
</P>
<P>
   From the first day, this campaign has had a cause, a vision of
change for our party and our country. Republicans must expand our
prosperity, and extend it to those who still struggle. We must be a
strong nation that cares for the weak and the forgotten. We must
welcome the new Americans _ Americans by choice _ because legal
immigration is not a source of national weakness, it is a sign of
national success. We are a party of principle. We must also be a
party of inclusion, a party with a generous heart and an open door.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, in the other party, Al Gore is celebrating victory as
well. I congratulate him and look forward to the contest. He is the
candidate of the status quo in Washington, D.C., and he has a tough
case to make in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has had
history's greatest opportunity to reform Social Security _ with a
growing surplus and a willing public. But they have chosen to
demagogue Social Security, not repair it. America needs a president
who will make Social Security a priority, not use it as a ploy. As
president, I'll reach across party lines to strengthen and preserve
Social Security, not only for our greatest generation, but also for
generation next.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has multiplied
the missions of our military, while cutting its capabilities. As
president, I will rebuild the strength of our military and the
prestige and stature of our country. We will give our men and women
in uniform the equipment they need and the respect they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has spoken of
education as a matter of bricks and mortar and bureaucratic
mandates. But the real problem in education is politicians who
never stop talking, and children who never start reading. For the
first time in decades, we are going to dramatically improve the
performance of our public schools in America. As president, I am
going to rescue children from failure, and return excellence to
American education through high standards, local control and strong
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of Clinton-Gore, we have the highest tax
burden since World War II. And yet we are told that taxes are not
an issue. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Not an issue _ while many families are punished by the tax code
just for being families. Not an issue _ while single mothers can
pay a higher marginal rate than the prosperous. It is an issue for
those Americans. And so it must be an issue in our campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I will take down the tollgate on the road to the middle class.
And I will cut taxes for everyone who pays taxes _ because the
surplus is not the government's money, the surplus is the people's
money.
</P>
<P>
   The polls say cutting taxes is not popular.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not proposing tax relief because it's the popular thing to
do. I'm proposing tax relief because it's the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   I will stand on principle, and I will bring honor to this
process and honor to the office I seek. I will remind Al Gore that
Americans do not want a White House where there is no controlling
legal authority. I will repair the broken bonds of trust between
Americans and their government. . . .
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the issues I will raise in my campaign. We
need to put behind us eight years of nightly polls and daily
attacks. Eight years of partisanship, gridlock and division. Eight
years is a long time _ and eight years is enough. We are ready _
and I believe this great country of ours is ready _ to return
exiled honor to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Someone will make history this November. Either we will ratify
the status quo or we will have a new beginning in American
politics. I say: America must not give Clinton-Gore four more
years.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, I invite every American, of every background, to join
our cause. If you believe our nation needs high standards and new
leaders, this is your campaign. If you believe politics should
inspire young people, not disillusion them, this is your campaign.
If you believe our country needs a fresh start . . . a clean break
. . . a rebirth of idealism, this is your campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I have so many people to thank tonight.

MARINERS LACK BIG PLUG FOR GAPING OUTFIELD HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Maybe it was intentional that the Anaheim Angels
decided against parading Jim Edmonds and Garrett Anderson in front
of the Mariners Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two outfielders were on the bench at Diablo Stadium during
Seattle's 5-3 win, putting a crimp in the Mariners' window
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, the talk around town was that the Cactus League game
would provide the American League West Division rivals an
opportunity to peruse the goods, in case the urge to swap escalated
into a mandate to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels need pitching and the Mariners need someone they can
count on in the outfield _ and we mean (BEGIN ITAL) really count
on, (END ITAL) as in power, as in a threat, as in homers and RBIs
and 150-plus games this summer.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems unlikely either rival would help make the other
one better, stranger things have happened. And if the Angels and
M's can't or won't make a deal, then the Mariners no doubt have a
few aces in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   For the M's, spring training is revealing that the loss of Ken
Griffey Jr. may no longer be emotionally wrenching. But that does
not eliminate the cold, hard fact that without No. 24, the Mariners
outfield is, well, a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a bunch of outfielders. Something definitely has to
be done, and that's too bad,'' said Brian Hunter, whose arbitration
win this winter makes his $2 million salary tough for the M's to
swallow if Hunter can't improve his on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of guys here who've worked hard to be here.
I know Lou (Piniella) is so good at putting in the best lineup to
win a game, but there are a lot of us here. I think that's why
they're still trying to make moves,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a question of who's in the Mariners outfield as much as
who isn't: In Peoria are Jay Buhner, Stan Javier, Raul Ibanez, Mark
McLemore, Mike Cameron, John Mabry and Hunter, not to mention four
others with minor league contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Amassing such a horde, however, has not delivered a truly
durable, reliable and productive outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, the Mariners have so many outfielders in camp that
Piniella has already said it's time to farm some of the fellas out
to create adequate playing time among the core group of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   If the luxury of penciling No. 24 into the lineup every single
day didn't spoil Piniella, he has certainly realized that this
abrupt transition to outfield by committee is a less-than-perfect
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go with what we have, I can rotate guys in, keep them
fresh. I'm comfortable with what we have. and I'm willing to go
with what we've got,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would think that we could use one more outfielder that
can be what you would consider an everyday force in your lineup. I
think we would be better served.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment of an eventual deal for another outfielder is
percolating throughout camp. And it is tough to forget the delight
with which Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln a few weeks ago announced
that, in addition to all the moves made this winter, the M's are
not done yet.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the M's are spending these first weeks of
spring playing a shell game. They are trying to determine all their
spare parts, knowing that they need to make a move for an
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   John Halama, who pitched three strong innings Tuesday in a ``B''
game against the Milwaukee Brewers, has been talking about trade
rumors that would send him to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But the M's have to guess right as to which pitcher to let go.
Tuesday, general manager Pat Gillick indicated that until he sees
Brett Tomko work a few games, it is too early to trade away
pitching, even if the M's appear to have an abundance of it right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the No. 1 need is undeniable. And it is out where a guy
named Junior used to help out Buhner in right field, where he
compensated for the 68 left fielders who played next to him during
Griffey's 11 seasons in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always open to getting better,'' Gillicks said. ``We could
get better with another left-handed hitter. But a lot of that
depends on what (Raul) Ibanez and (John) Mabry do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick says a left-handed power hitter with a track record for
production who plays ``average defense'' is their top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'd feel safer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose some 130 RBI, we're going to have to replace
that. ... I think everyone can kind of lock into who the starters
are, the infield and the catchers, but one area of experiment, of
uncertainty, is what the outfield will be,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Griffey told the M's to trade him to Cincinnati, everyone
had had months to resign themselves to the reality of his
departure. But what to do in Griffey's absence is still a problem _
one the Mariners seem aimed at fixing.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to good guys like Ibanez and Mabry, Cameron and
McLemore and Javier, but so far it is clear the M's do not have
anything resembling Griffey's replacement.

MAKE LENT PAINLESS WITH THIS SACRIFICIAL `MISS LIST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As kids, my brother and sisters and I would always have to give
up five pleasurable things during Lent as a sign of our Christian
self-discipline. I once promised to give up lentils till my mom
reminded me I had never eaten lentils in my life. Still, it became
a game among my siblings and me to forgo something we wouldn't
really miss. In that spirit of sacrifice on the EZ plan, I hereby
abstain from the following during this Lenten season:
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence.'' After panning the first few episodes last year,
I confessed that I'd somehow become addicted to this weekly taste
of treacle, maybe because I grew up in Rhode Island. It certainly
wasn't because of the writing, which Melina Kanakaredes praised
effusively at the TV Guide Awards Sunday night, but which is about
as engaging as the fine print on a car-rental agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.'' The party's over. Time for
Regis to pack it in and go looking for a successor to Kathie Lee. I
realize he just signed a new big-bucks contract with ABC, which
means ``Millionaire'' will overstay its welcome by a factor of
jeezlouise, but when I'm surfing these days and I come across the
all-too-familiar set with its high-tech gloss and overwrought
music, my reaction registers somewhere between torpor and
phlegmaticness. This is partly good, because I like to use the word
phlegmatic, but bad for ABC because I hit the remote faster than
you can say, ``Is that your vinyl ant, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal.'' Hard to believe I used to rearrange my schedule
to see this show. Now Monday night rolls around and I don't even
remember it's on. Maybe it's just me, cuz the show is still Fox's
most-watched, but I prefer to remember the likable characters from
the first season, not the unpleasant narcissists they've become.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files.'' Don't tell anyone, but it actually became the
``Ex-Files'' for me sometime last season. Maybe it was the move to
L.A., maybe it was just the ennui creeping in during the sixth
season. Or maybe the truth really isn't out there in the ether.
It's in ``Roswell,'' on The WB.

NOW, GORE AND BUSH CAN CONCENTRATE ON EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, Tuesday night provided enough sweet victories to let both
men begin to focus on running against each other in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Each planned to treat his primary rival with respect to unify
his party. But neither worried anymore about losing the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   They have been toughened by a primary campaign that replaced a
mere party coronation. They now can try to correct some things,
like Bush's swing toward his party's right after losing in New
Hampshire. But there are also matters they can do little or nothing
about, like Gore's embarrassing fund-raising appearance at a
Buddhist temple in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest problem ahead is one they face jointly. A
substantial, quite possibly decisive minority of primary voters who
supported their rivals, former Sen. Bill Bradley and Sen. John
McCain, did so because they were fed up with the big money that
dominates today's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fall, both Gore and Bush will be raising and spending
every last dollar they can find, while their supporters fill the
airwaves with ``issue ads'' that the candidates will claim _
accurately, perhaps, but not necessarily believably _ to have
nothing to do with.
</P>
<P>
   So the rivals will face the chore of winning votes from the
self-styled ``reform'' voters while doing things that those voters
find abhorrent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's attempt at a solution is already on the table: a
commitment to the same legislation that Bradley and McCain backed.
For Bush, the path is less clear, and he may choose to ignore the
campaign finance issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried to meet that issue Tuesday night with a proposal that
could eliminate the most controversial way that campaign money is
spent _ on 30-second and 60-second broadcast spots. He called, as
he did in the primary campaign, for two debates a week and no
30-second or 60-second commercials. McCain might have agreed, but
Bush almost certainly will not, and then Gore can blame him for a
hugely expensive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has particular reason to worry about voters who supported
Sen. John McCain. A poll of voters in California Tuesday showed
that of those who voted for McCain in the Republican primary, about
two-fifths planned to desert the Republican Party and vote for Gore
in the fall. Only a handful of the Democratic primary voters who
backed Bradley expected to defect from Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   The first steps toward courting the voters for McCain and
Bradley were taken Tuesday night when the victors praised the men
who had made their lives difficult. Gore said in Nashville, Tenn.,
that Bradley was a ``good man for whom I have great respect.'' He
said, ``Anybody who has heard Bill Bradley throughout this campaign
has come away from the experience moved and touched by the strength
of his commitment to healing the divisions in our country,
especially divisions based on race.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges to Bush are more obvious. While the campaign
answered, in the affirmative, one question about him _ whether he
could take a punch _ it dislodged him from the stance he had taken
at the start of his campaign: that of the ``compassionate
conservative'' who could get votes from Hispanics and
African-Americans, the practical reformer who could offer something
different from ideology-bound congressional Republicans,
</P>
<P>
   Just on Monday, Bush tried to mend the tears in that robe,
speaking out for tolerance and softening his opposition to talking
to gay Republicans. But the necessity of winning in South Carolina
a few weeks ago forced a dependence in his campaign on the
Christian right, which scares suburban Republicans, whom the Gore
campaign can be expected to keep reminding of that link.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Bush went back to the message of his announcement
speech last summer, saying in his advance text, ``This campaign has
had a cause, a vision of change for our party and our country.
Republicans must expand our prosperity, and extend it to those who
still struggle. We must be a strong nation that also cares for the
weak and forgotten. We must welcome the new Americans _ Americans
by choice _ because legal immigration is not a source of national
weakness, it is a sign of national success. We are a party of
principle. We must also be a party of inclusion _ a party with a
gracious heart and an open door.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was drawn to the left by Bradley's challenge, that
challenge involved no dramatic political change; and, except for
Gore's opposition to current military policy on gay soldiers,
nothing that Bush could really attack. The Bradley challenge to
Gore came earlier than the McCain run at Bush. That gave the vice
president the chance to sharpen his approach last fall, and not,
like Bush, in the heat of the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Another need Bush has is to broaden the structure of his
campaign to include both non-Texans and Republicans with national
experience. His is a campaign that has not looked smooth while
winning. The Bush campaign ignored the traditional style of open
campaigning in New Hampshire, where McCain won in a landslide, and
squandered its huge financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began Tuesday night to hammer Gore over the Buddhist-temple
and other campaign-finance irregularities, saying in his prepared
text, ``I will remind Al Gore that Americans do not want a White
House where there is no controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore started on the obvious counterstrategy by saying,
``I've learned from my mistakes.'' His hope is that the public will
tire of the subject and prefer to consider the Clinton years in
terms of a booming economy. The Gore campaign knows that it has
been many decades since voters have thrown out the party in power
in good economic times.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign is hoping that this year will be
different, and that dismay over Clinton's personal behavior will
lead the public, as Bush put it, to deny ``Clinton-Gore a third
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have one other problem in common, the risk of
overconfidence. ``We've got to pretend that we're behind,'' said
one Gore ally.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the problem may be more severe for Gore than for Bush
because the vice president's manner of explaining things _ oh, so
patiently _already carries an air of condescension.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sen. John McCain was left Tuesday night facing an
agonizing decision: how long and how far to prolong a campaign that
has evolved over 14 months from an underrated candidacy into what
he calls his mission to transform the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   With his rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, piling up enough
delegates and winning so many key contests across the nation,
including New York, that he was assured the nomination, McCain on
Tuesday night wished Bush well, and said, ``we may meet again in
primaries a few days from now and we have a little rest.''
</P>
<P>
   He left ambiguous whether his candidacy would continue, but not
his ``crusade'' to reform the party. He told cheering supporters
that ``our crusade continues tonight, tomorrow, the next day, the
day after that, and for as long as it takes to restore America's
confidence and pride in the practice and institutions of our great
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He planned to fly Wednesday to his vacation retreat in
Cottonwood, in the Red Mountain region of his home state of
Arizona, to rest and consider his options, which range from an
immediate pullout this week after his heady 14-month ride, or a
last-stand forward toward the Illinois primary two weeks from now
or even beyond. Mark Salter, a longtime aide, said the senator had
made ``no decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He staff, meanwhile, also fought to keep up an undaunted
appearance, releasing a campaign schedule for Colorado and Illinois
for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the question was, to what end? For weeks McCain has argued
strenuously that he and not Bush was the one who would be his
party's strongest standard-bearer to defeat Vice President Al Gore,
because of the senator's suddenly discovered cross-over appeal to
independents and conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night left him lagging in delegates and with a
diminished ability to make that case, failing to meet his own
campaign's best case scenarios. While McCain swept most of New
England, he lost Maine. He won only a relative handful of delegates
in New York. The bellwether state of Ohio went strongly for Bush,
too, leaving McCain unable to say that his Michigan victory two
weeks ago signaled some larger appeal across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   And the all-important state of California looked like it could
well disappoint his hopes of winning the popular vote, with exit
polls suggesting that both Gore and Bush could come in ahead of
him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has emphatically proclaimed the Republican party his home
and said he would support Bush should he become the Republican
nominee, even as he railed that Bush and his allies were trying to
win the presidency ``in the worst way.''
</P>
<P>
   But so bitter and personal has the struggle with Bush become
that not all of McCain's closest associates were willing to rule
out the possibility that the senator might yet, for all his
denials, follow the lead of his hero Theodore Roosevelt and make
some kind of third party bid.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a close friend of McCain's, said,
however, that the Arizona senator needed time to study the delegate
count, but added: ``He won't put the country or the party through
any high drama.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as McCain has proclaimed himself on a ``great crusade''
to create a more inclusive, reform-minded Republican Party, fewer
and fewer of his fellow Republicans have been willing to join him
as his campaign has become more aggressively critical of Republican
orthodoxy on tax cutting, on campaign finance law, and on its open
arms to leaders of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The senator himself made an elliptical allusion to the problem
at his last campaign stop in San Diego late Monday afternoon when
he gazed out at a rally in the Old Town section outside a Mexican
restaurant and spotted a woman waving a placard, ``Soccer moms for
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer moms for McCain,'' he called out. ``Up in Santa Clara
this morning we had carnivores for McCain. In Cleveland we had
Ukrainians for McCain.'' Then he burst out laughing, and added,
``I'm telling you we are assembling a coalition never seen before
in the history of American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   All that he lacked was vast numbers of Republicans for McCain.
But Tuesday morning, as he continued to work the phone calling talk
radio host after talk radio host in New York and California, he
proclaimed his happiness at the independents he had brought to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how proud I am to have sparked this kind of
prairie fire out there that's getting people involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans unaffiliated with McCain's campaign said that after
a spectacular showing in New Hampshire, the senator had lost his
way from the moment he delivered a defiant speech after his South
Carolina loss, attacking Bush as a fraud. In the last few weeks his
more uplifting themes of public service, patriotism and great
causes have been nearly drowned out by his appeals to regional and
class resentments.
</P>
<P>
   His closing tactic in the past few days had been to attack Bush
for the fact that a Texas family, which has been a big contributor
to the governor, had poured $2.5 million into last minute attack
ads against McCain. ``We ask Governor Bush to do what he refused to
do,'' he said at rallies across California on Monday, ``tell his
sleazy Texas buddies to stop these negative ads and take their
money back to Texas where it belongs and don't try to corrupt
American politics with your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said: ``The John McCain
people saw since South Carolina is not the same John McCain people
saw in New Hampshire. Disciplined aggressiveness is essential in
politics. Undisciplined aggressiveness gets you in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact one voter Tuesday, Harold Noyes, pastor of the
nondenominational Christian Community Church in Athens, Ga., voted
for Alan Keyes and complained, ``McCain has been kind of whining a
lot lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear whether McCain's fiery speech last week branding
Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, prominent leaders of the
Christian right, as ``agents of intolerance,'' did anything but
backfire against him.
</P>
<P>
   Polls of voters in New York showed that those who said the
speech ``affected'' their vote _ about a third of the total
Republican vote _ went 3-to-1 for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's aides said that members of the Christian right
would not have supported McCain anyway and that his speech was a
stand on principle, not a tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a defining moment for our campaign,'' John Weaver,
McCain's political director, said. ``Our party is at a fork in the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver promised that no matter who wins the Republican
nomination, McCain and his supporters ``are not going to slip
quietly into the night.''

<P>
   Some campaigns are about winning and some are about losing.
</P>
<P>
   The best way for John McCain to prove that big money corrupts
politics is for his candidacy to be destroyed by big money. The
best way to show how much he rocked the pillars of the Republican
Party is for those pillars to crush him. Tuesday night they did.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator wasn't running a campaign so much as an
auto-da-fe, with himself as the martyr in the flames.He called Big
Tobacco ``jerks.'' He ranted that the people running Bob Jones
University were ``idiots.'' He blasted the televangelists of the
right as ``evil.'' He dubbed his own party establishment the
``Death Star.'' He mocked his colleagues in Congress by christening
Washington the ``city of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   His heroic life story was about enduring suffering, which was
stirring. But his campaign was also about enduring suffering, and
that was irritating.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an America that worships victimhood, you can't run for
president as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   As his prolix, caffeinated bus sped through Manhattan, McCain
railed against Sam Wyly, the Texas businessman and Bush contributor
who saturated New York, California and Ohio with ads trashing
McCain's environmental record and promoting George W. Bush's lame
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a textbook study,'' he said. ``This whole thing is the
most perfect example of why I have been so zealous in my pursuit of
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. An outsider or a special interest should not be
able to come into a primary state and drop millions to sway voters
with misleading ads.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain was not satisfied with merely being right about
sleazy pro-Bush tactics. He tried to make his rightness into the
only rationale of his campaign. In Boston, exhorting a crowd to
rebel against the Wyly ads, he echoed the 1996 Bob Dole line about
Clinton campaign finance abuses: ``Where's the outrage?''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work for Dole. And John McCain, who was at his side in
'96, should have known it wouldn't work for him in 2000. Voters do
not respond to mere rectitude. They want to know, in concrete
terms, what you are going to do for them.
</P>
<P>
   The senator kept saying he didn't want to fall into self-pity or
negative attacks. But then he fell into self-pity and negative
attacks. He kept saying he didn't want to act like Bill Bradley,
and make the race about his own moral superiority. But then he
acted like Bill Bradley and made the race about his own moral
superiority. On his bus last Friday, McCain sounded almost wistful.
``If I made a mistake in this campaign, it's because I allowed
myself to be diverted over tactics,'' he said. ``The ability to
inspire young Americans is what this campaign is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   He started out with a bracing message about casting the
money-changers out of Washington. But he ended up aggrieved, and he
wanted reporters and voters to feel aggrieved with him. ``He became
bitter and angry,'' says Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster.
``Someone around him should have said, `Senator, stop, you're
becoming just another politician.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain confused virtue with substance. He got so absorbed in his
performance as Luke Skywalker that he forgot about the issues. In a
weird way, he became as contentless as Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The senator went beyond making the case that the Bush campaign
played out of bounds. He took the smarmy tactics too personally,
and tried to make the case that he was good and everyone who
opposed him was evil. His righteousness slowly morphed into a kind
of narcissism, in which he became the personification of everything
worth voting for.
</P>
<P>
   He was a crusader, and crusaders are easily outplayed. The Bush
strategy was to gaslight the volatile senator. They always knew
that when they turned up the heat, McCain would become inflamed.
Sure enough, his campaign began to seem like a huge inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   His extreme language and defensive tone alienated the voters who
once found him exciting. He thought he was showing them his
strength, but he was showing them his weakness.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody finds weakness exciting for very long.

EDMOND KAISER, 86, FOUNDER OF CHARITIES

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    GENEVA _ Edmond Kaiser, founder of Terre des Hommes and other
children's organizations, died Saturday on a visit to India, a
spokesman for one of the charities said. He was 86.
 &HT;    Kaiser organized Terre des Hommes in 1959, after having learned
of the condition of children in Algeria. It is now one of
Switzerland's best-known charities, with worldwide operations to
aid suffering from poverty, illness and war.
 &HT;    Born to a Jewish family in Paris, Kaiser lived in Switzerland in
his childhood. He returned to France to work with the French
resistance in World War II and had been condemned to death by the
Nazis.
 &HT;    In 1947, he returned to Lausanne, Switzerland, and he later
started his charitable work there. Describing his work in a
newspaper interview in 1994, Kaiser said, ``If someone is crying on
the ground, we try to pick them up, just like we would care for an
injured bird, love it and then help it fly again.'' 
 &HT;    In 1990, France offered Kaiser the Chevalier of the Legion of
Honor. He turned it down. ``Sitting in the middle of dead or
suffering Biafran children, out with the children of Vietnam whose
skin has been peeled away by napalm, it would be as if I found it
normal to be honored for their martyrdom,'' he wrote in a letter to
the French government.
 &HT;    He left Terre des Hommes in 1979 to work with Sentinelles, a
charity devoted to combating the prostitution, mutilation and
slavery of children in developing countries. He founded another
group, Families Without Borders, in 1992.

EDITORIAL: A DECISIVE DAY FOR FRONT-RUNNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Changes headline, updates throughout) 
(jt) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 8:
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush won the sweeping
nationwide victories Tuesday that both had been counting on to
speed them toward their party nominations for president. Gore's
rout of former Sen. Bill Bradley in races all across the country
ended the Democratic contest. Based on exit surveys in California
and vote tabulations elsewhere, Bush was leading the race for
delegates in the major states, falling short only in New England.
Should Sen. John McCain decide to continue in the race and expand
on his showing in the Northeast, he will face extremely long odds.
The senator made a good effort in New York, but did not get the
turnaround victory he sought.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the voting Tuesday could be seen as both Bush
and Gore issued gracious compliments to the men they defeated and
immediately turned their sights on each other. Given the likelihood
that the vice president will be running against the son of the man
defeated by President Clinton in 1992, it was interesting that both
his and Bush's speeches looked back as well as forward. Gore, not
surprisingly, warned against returning to Republican rule. And
although Bush spoke of a new beginning, he also declared, ``I
believe our country is ready to return exiled honor to the White
House.'' More than most campaigns, this one is almost certain to
dwell on the past as well as the future.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate, Gore has clearly scored one of the most
impressive recoveries in many years. He started out only six months
ago struggling to overcome his image as an awkward figure running a
costly, uninspired campaign based on the idea of entitlement. When
Democrats started moving toward Bradley as a fresher candidate,
Gore junked his campaign plan, threw off the smothering cloak of
supposed inevitability and starting fighting for the nomination. He
emerged from his clashes with Bradley with a sharper debating
style, though still lacking the emotional connection with voters
that seemed to come so easily to McCain on the Republican side.
Gore's unbroken string of primary victories has made him no less
reviled by Republicans, but many of them admit that he will be a
tough competitor in November.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Gore was able to use the later primaries as a warm-up,
they have been a battle for survival for Bush. Despite his
victories Tuesday, the Texas governor is looking more battered than
anyone could have predicted when he began as a pre-emptive
favorite. Recent polls show him even with Gore, instead of leading
the vice president as he was a few months ago. Bush's performance
on the trail raised unexpected questions about his knowledge,
experience and debating skills. Even more damaging, however, has
been his ideological repositioning, accompanied by an embrace of
the party's cultural conservatives. As he now tries to move back to
the center, Bush will find Gore camped out there.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's performance Tuesday, on the most decisive day of the
young campaign year, plus his strong regional base in the Sun Belt,
give his supporters ample reason for optimism. His fund-raising
ability is another asset. But the real test for Bush will be
whether he can make warnings against eight more years of the
Clinton-Gore administration _ a theme unveiled in his victory
speech Tuesday night _ into a message that will last for eight more
months. Bush's gibe about ``no controlling legal authority'' gave a
hint of the tough rhetoric to come.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's concession speech had a valedictory tone. He clearly
fell far short of the scenario his team envisioned following the
New Hampshire victory on Feb. 1. It was then that his spokesmen
talked openly of igniting one state after another with McCain's
heroic story and his crusade for reform. When he was attacked
unfairly by the religious right in South Carolina, McCain returned
the fire. That decision to counterattack now looks like a costly
tactical mistake that damaged the aura of his campaign, revived old
worries about his temperament and unsettled many mainstream
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain promised a decision on his future in a couple of days.
Even if he drops out of the race, he pledged to continue to speak
out and espouse his appeal for moderation and campaign finance
reform. Whatever happens, McCain has opened a historically
significant debate among Republicans over the fundamental purpose
and direction of their party. That debate ought to continue.

FIX: CHANGES REFERENCE TO ``FLYERS SECOND LINE'' TO ``BRUINS SECOND
LINE'' 
STARS NOT BUYING AGING DEFENDERS IN SELLER'S MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been counting down the days until the NHL trade
deadline _ Tuesday _ then you know that the Stars are rumored to be
in the running for acquiring:
</P>
<P>
   A. Doug Gilmour
</P>
<P>
   B. Mark Messier
</P>
<P>
   C. North Dakota
</P>
<P>
   D. the vast thoroughbred empire of Wimp-Free Stables.
</P>
<P>
   In truth _ and some purportedly wise NHL minds may not believe
this _ but the answer could well be none of the above. Owner Tom
Hicks doesn't have a bottomless wallet, though it is a formidably
spacious one. Nor is every $6 million-a-year 39-year-old a perfect
fit for the defending Stanley Cup champion Stars.
</P>
<P>
   News of the latest superstar to swap jerseys for a stretch run
at the Cup _ this time, it was Boston's Ray Bourque going to
Colorado _ did not pass unnoticed at the Stars' compound. But by
the same token, the building yesterday wasn't exactly draped in
black.
</P>
<P>
   For 21 years, granted, Bourque has been a great player, a likely
Hall of Fame player. There were Aprils when some say that he
carried the Bruins single-handedly through the playoffs on his own
back.
</P>
<P>
   But when future Hall of Famers are on the auction block, it's
usually a seller's market. Boston general manager Harry Sinden,
instead of closing on a reported deal with Philadelphia, the team
that was Bourque's first choice, shopped the veteran shamelessly.
Indeed, sources say, he tried to use the Avalanche's offer to help
pry young center Simon Gagne away from the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   When the Flyers had nothing else to barter, Sinden sent Bourque
two time zones and one full conference away. Colorado thinks it
just traded for a sure spot in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' silence, on the other hand, speaks volumes.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars don't need a Ray Bourque. It sounds blasphemous, but
there's no room. No room in Hicks' big wallet, probably, and no
room in the Stars' future.
</P>
<P>
   This team needs goal scorers, not 39-year-old defenders. It
needs somebody to share the offensive load until the aches, pains
and broken bones of this difficult season finally mend.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Bourque's contract will expire at the end of this
season. Detroit, which was also interested, reportedly wanted
Bourque to commit to a two-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars already have a corps of young and/or experienced
defensemen under contract. They need goal scorers. Stop me if
you've heard this before.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL deadline is next week _ hence, the headlines. But the
Stars actually fired a preemptive strike, of sorts, a full month
ago, when they sent Derek Plante and Kevin Dean to Chicago for
defensemen Dave Manson and Sylvain Cote.
</P>
<P>
   As Bourque now tries to fit in with the Avalanche, the way Chris
Chelios and Wendel Clark thought they would do so smoothly in
Detroit a year ago, Manson and Cote have had a four-week head
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the seven to 10 days preceding the March 14 deadline, the
activity usually increases,'' Stars general manager Bob Gainey said
yesterday. ``But my own feeling is that if you can make your change
earlier, it allows time for those players to adapt and adjust to
your team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often they are coming off teams where they haven't been in a
successful situation, and it takes a little while to shake those
cobwebs out.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unspoken by Gainey was something even more important. If
the Stars hadn't grabbed Cote and Manson early, somebody else _ the
Red Wings, probably _ would have.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars need goal scorers. Did I forget to say that?
</P>
<P>
   But as history tells us, this is the time of year when NHL teams
habitually begin to think defense. Every contender thinks things
will be fine, if they can only get another big, nasty,
presence-asserting defenseman _ or two, or three.
</P>
<P>
   It's a seller's market. To get Bourque, the Avalanche gave up a
package of four players, including Sami Pahlsson, a talented young
forward currently playing out his contract in Sweden. He will move
right onto the Bruins' second line next season, reports say.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at trade deadline, Colorado surrendered another part
of its youth to get Theo Fleury from Calgary. When the playoffs
were done, Fleury signed with the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't miss the opportunity if we think there's a place
where we can improve our team,'' Gainey said simply, though
noncommittally.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque, in other words, great as he has been for 21 NHL
seasons, the Stars can do without.
</P>
<P>
   But another goal scorer? By all means.
</P>
<P>

ANXIOUS INVESTORS DRIVE DOWN THE DOW MORE THAN 374 POINTS

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 374.47
points Tuesday on investors' fears that rising oil prices combined
with higher interest rates may do significant damage to corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The fall began when Procter &AMP; Gamble, one of the nation's
biggest and best-known companies and one of the 30 stocks in the
Dow, said early Tuesday that its earnings in the current quarter
would come in well below the levels expected by Wall Street
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The warning, which came just a week after the company had
assured investors that its sales and earnings were on track,
shocked investors. They dumped P&AMP;G shares, wiping out $36 billion,
or nearly 31 percent, of the company's value. Adding to investors'
anxiety, oil prices soared to $34.13 a barrel, a price not seen
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, already troubled by the pinch on corporate profits
that will result from rising interest rates, now have to worry
about the ill effects of the higher costs of materials on company
earnings this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average took the biggest hit, falling
374.47 points, or 3.7 percent, to 9,796.03. Broader market averages
fared a bit better; the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.6
percent of its value, while the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index
declined 2.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index, the focus of
investor ardor in recent months because of its collection of
hot-growing technology stocks, lost only 1.2 percent of its value.
It closed at 4,847.84.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has been walking on eggshells because of the Fed,
but that was in an environment where they felt confident about
earnings,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``That has now been brought into
question because of P&AMP;G. Earnings worries, interest rates and oil
prices are often enough to unglue even the calmest investor.''
</P>
<P>
   The plunge in P&AMP;G was responsible for just under a third of the
Dow's decline, the fourth-largest drop in points ever registered in
the average. In percentage terms, Tuesday's decline was not
historic. For the year, the Dow is down 14.8 percent while the
Nasdaq has gained 19.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of rival consumer goods companies fell on Procter &AMP;
Gamble's news that its earnings would decline as much as 11 percent
in the quarter rather than gain the roughly 9 percent forecast by
the company previously. Drug companies also fell, as did the shares
of banks and financial services concerns. Shares of larger
technology companies favored by investors like Cisco Systems,
General Electric and Nortel Networks also sank.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the 30 companies in the Dow average rose. Exxon
Mobil, a beneficiary of rising oil prices, closed at $80.50, up
$7.5625, and Microsoft jumped $2.25, to close at $92.875. United
Technologies rose 50 cents, to $50.50.
</P>
<P>
   While few investors own the Dow Jones industrial average, many
investors do hold mutual funds that mirror the performance of the
S&AMP;P index. After five years of double-digit gains, it is down 7.73
percent this year. It fell 35.66 points Tuesday, to 1,355.62.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in oil prices, which are at levels not seen since 1991,
put significant pressure on stocks Tuesday. ``Oil is responsible
for about two-thirds of the decline in the Dow,'' said Christine A.
Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
``The perceptions on inflation are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the reasons why Procter &AMP; Gamble's earnings in
the current quarter will be so grim is that its materials costs are
rising. The company said the creeping costs of plastics, many of
which are oil-based, and paper, to a lesser degree, have cut into
profit margins. Investors are clearly worried that these problems
are not limited to P&AMP;G and may be a harbinger of earnings
shortfalls at other old-stock-market reliables.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, investors continue to pour money into shares of
fledgling technology companies whose growth seems more promising.
Reversing what had been a longstanding trend in the stock market,
small companies' stocks are now vastly outperforming those of large
companies. According to Salomon Smith Barney, as of the end of last
week, shares of the smallest companies _ those with market values
of $250 million or less _ were up 18 percent for the year. Stocks
of the biggest companies, those with market values in excess of $20
billion, were down 2 percent for the year as of Friday. That trend
continued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists viewed the blue-chip selloff warily. ``This is
truly causing us to question the viability of the big bull market
that began in 1982,'' said Alan R. Shaw, head of technical research
at Salomon Smith Barney. ``There are still people funneling money
into Nasdaq stocks but common sense and history suggest that
eventually these stocks as well will suffer corrections.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors clearly see fast-growing technology companies as a
safe haven. But some strategists question whether these so-called
new-economy stocks will be impervious to a slowdown in the
old-world companies. ``It's as though you have one economy on earth
and the other on Mars,'' said David Dreman, head of Dreman Value
Management. ``Roughly 50 percent of capital expenditures goes to
technology spending on one form or another. If the old economy
turns down I don't think it's good for the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global
Investors, agreed. ``If there is a change in employment trends and
a slowing in income growth as a result of interest rates, the
demand for this new economy is going to slow down,'' he said. ``If
that happens, their growth rates will decelerate and these
companies will experience a closing of the gap between the old and
the new.''
</P>
<P>
   Most stocks are already in a bear market. According to Salomon
Smith Barney, 77.8 percent of the S&AMP;P 500 stocks are down 20
percent or more. And even though the Nasdaq is up, 62.1 percent of
its stocks have declined 20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the slide in stock prices coupled with higher
oil prices may slow the economy and reduce pressure on the Federal
Reserve to push interest rates sharply higher in coming months.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has clearly
warned investors that policy-makers will raise rates by one-quarter
of a point at their next meeting on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Callies said that while stock prices might soften a bit further,
underlying fundamentals remain positive. ``As far as I can tell,
commodity prices increases will be temporary, and the structure of
corporate profits is still quite strong,'' she said.

MARINERS LACK BIG PLUG FOR GAPING OUTFIELD HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Maybe it was intentional that the Anaheim Angels
decided against parading Jim Edmonds and Garrett Anderson in front
of the Mariners Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two outfielders were on the bench at Diablo Stadium during
Seattle's 5-3 win, putting a crimp in the Mariners' window
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, the talk around town was that the Cactus League game
would provide the American League West Division rivals an
opportunity to peruse the goods, in case the urge to swap escalated
into a mandate to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels need pitching and the Mariners need someone they can
count on in the outfield _ and we mean (BEGIN ITAL) really count
on, (END ITAL) as in power, as in a threat, as in homers and RBIs
and 150-plus games this summer.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems unlikely either rival would help make the other
one better, stranger things have happened. And if the Angels and
M's can't or won't make a deal, then the Mariners no doubt have a
few aces in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   For the M's, spring training is revealing that the loss of Ken
Griffey Jr. may no longer be emotionally wrenching. But that does
not eliminate the cold, hard fact that without No. 24, the Mariners
outfield is, well, a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a bunch of outfielders. Something definitely has to
be done, and that's too bad,'' said Brian Hunter, whose arbitration
win this winter makes his $2 million salary tough for the M's to
swallow if Hunter can't improve his on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of guys here who've worked hard to be here.
I know Lou (Piniella) is so good at putting in the best lineup to
win a game, but there are a lot of us here. I think that's why
they're still trying to make moves,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a question of who's in the Mariners outfield as much as
who isn't: In Peoria are Jay Buhner, Stan Javier, Raul Ibanez, Mark
McLemore, Mike Cameron, John Mabry and Hunter, not to mention four
others with minor league contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Amassing such a horde, however, has not delivered a truly
durable, reliable and productive outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, the Mariners have so many outfielders in camp that
Piniella has already said it's time to farm some of the fellas out
to create adequate playing time among the core group of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   If the luxury of penciling No. 24 into the lineup every single
day didn't spoil Piniella, he has certainly realized that this
abrupt transition to outfield by committee is a less-than-perfect
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go with what we have, I can rotate guys in, keep them
fresh. I'm comfortable with what we have. and I'm willing to go
with what we've got,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would think that we could use one more outfielder that
can be what you would consider an everyday force in your lineup. I
think we would be better served.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment of an eventual deal for another outfielder is
percolating throughout camp. And it is tough to forget the delight
with which Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln a few weeks ago announced
that, in addition to all the moves made this winter, the M's are
not done yet.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the M's are spending these first weeks of
spring playing a shell game. They are trying to determine all their
spare parts, knowing that they need to make a move for an
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   John Halama, who pitched three strong innings Tuesday in a ``B''
game against the Milwaukee Brewers, has been talking about trade
rumors that would send him to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But the M's have to guess right as to which pitcher to let go.
Tuesday, general manager Pat Gillick indicated that until he sees
Brett Tomko work a few games, it is too early to trade away
pitching, even if the M's appear to have an abundance of it right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the No. 1 need is undeniable. And it is out where a guy
named Junior used to help out Buhner in right field, where he
compensated for the 68 left fielders who played next to him during
Griffey's 11 seasons in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always open to getting better,'' Gillicks said. ``We could
get better with another left-handed hitter. But a lot of that
depends on what (Raul) Ibanez and (John) Mabry do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick says a left-handed power hitter with a track record for
production who plays ``average defense'' is their top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'd feel safer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose some 130 RBI, we're going to have to replace
that. ... I think everyone can kind of lock into who the starters
are, the infield and the catchers, but one area of experiment, of
uncertainty, is what the outfield will be,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Griffey told the M's to trade him to Cincinnati, everyone
had had months to resign themselves to the reality of his
departure. But what to do in Griffey's absence is still a problem _
one the Mariners seem aimed at fixing.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to good guys like Ibanez and Mabry, Cameron and
McLemore and Javier, but so far it is clear the M's do not have
anything resembling Griffey's replacement.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore crushed their
rivals from ocean to ocean Tuesday in powerful displays that
assured them their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   After claiming the two biggest electoral powerhouses of
California and New York, which account for more than 40 percent of
the delegates chosen Tuesday, Bush and Gore immediately turned to
each other _ and to firing the first salvos of the general election
campaign that lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush laid out several themes for the general election in a
combative speech that was devoted not to his challenger, Sen &UR; . &LR; 
John McCain, but to lambasting Gore. ``He is the candidate of the
status quo in Washington, D.C., and he has a tough case to make in
the general election,'' Bush said to supporters in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At a boisterous rally in Nashville earlier in the evening, Gore
did not mention Bush by name but called on the Republican nominee
to debate him twice a week and to spurn unregulated soft money
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will challenge the Republican nominee to hold joint open
meetings with me,'' he said, ``to make this contest of ideas and
not insults, a campaign conducted in full daylight and not through
secretly funded special interest attack ads or smear telephone
calls from the extremist right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, did not
win one state, a defeat so pronounced that his advisers said it was
only a matter of days before he withdraws. And McCain said he would
retreat to the mountains of Arizona to ``take stock of our
losses,'' and decide whether to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's victories were particularly impressive because he was
supported by a majority of every demographic group in the 16 states
with Democratic contests, and, significantly, by women, who backed
him in some states by margins of more than 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   In several states Gore held a margin of 3-to-1 or better. Gore
also racked up a double-digit margin in New York, a victory made
even sweeter by the memory of his dismal performance in the 1988
presidential primary, where he won a paltry 10 percent and quit the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not win one state, a defeat so pronounced that his
advisers said it was only a matter of days before he withdraws.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican verdict Tuesday was decisive, though not as
overwhelming. Bush prevailed by comfortable margins in California
and New York, as well as in the large Midwest states of Ohio and
Missouri and in the only southern state voting Tuesday, Georgia. Of
the 13 Republican contests, McCain captured four relatively small
New England states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Gore and Bush victories in California, the most
sought-after electoral prize of all, it was not clear which of the
four contenders would prevail in that state's popular vote, which
is not binding but could be a telling measure of a candidates'
potency in November.
</P>
<P>
   The voting Tuesday was tantamount to a national primary. Never
before have so many states, in every region, held contests on the
same day. Roughly a third of the delegates to the parties' national
conventions were up for grabs. The Democrat needs 2,170 delegates
to get the party's nomination; the Republican needs 1,034. By
Tuesday night, Gore roughly 300 short of the magic total; Bush's
actual delegate tally was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the primaries capped the most
contentious nomination battle in decades, a week-by-week electoral
see-saw in which Bush would win one round, only to be humbled by
McCain in the next. Bush entered Tuesday's voting with more
victories and more delegates. But no one could safely bet what
would happen because in the entire yearlong run-up to the
primaries, Bush had been widely viewed as the front-runner, only to
see his prospects grow far more precarious after McCain trounced
him in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But McCain, of Arizona, asserted in a brief speech at a late
rally in West Hollywood that he was not about to give up his
crusade _ but left open the possibility that he will quit the race.
``Our crusade continues, tonight, tommorow, the next day, the day
after that and for as long as it takes to restore America's
confidence and pride in the practice and institutions of our great
democracy.''  &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race was far less climactic Tuesday because while
Bradley emerged as a threat last fall _ polls at one point had him
beating Gore in New Hampshire _ that spurt of popularity never
translated to the voting booth. Bradley, a former senator from New
Jersey, was shut out by Gore in every contest before Tuesday.
Bradley's campaign had so sputtered that even before the voting
Tuesday, many of his most prominent supporters said it would take a
miracle for him to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At a subdued gathering in Manhattan Tuesday night, Bradley said
he had called the vice president to congratulate him _ and he
insisted that his campaign was a worthy crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our lack of victory tonight, we've shaped the national
debate in this campaign,'' he said. ``We've brought core Democratic
issues to the fore. When no one was talking about the 44 million
Americans without health insurance, we gave voice to the voiceless.
When no one was talking about the 13 children who die every day of
gun violence we heard their cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has so fizzled that even on his signature issue, health
care, voters were more likely to say that the vice president had
the preferable plan. The sweep of Gore's triumph allows him to move
more quickly to patch up relations with Bradley's backers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory was not as pronounced. The polls of voters
Tuesday, conducted by a consortium of the television networks and
the Associated Press, found that Bush and McCain continued to draw
from far different bases of support. Republicans backed Bush
overwhelmingly while independents and Democrats, in states where
they could vote for a Republican, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The victors in each state depended largely on the proportion of
independents and Republicans in the electorate. In Ohio, for
example, more than seven in 10 voters described themselves as
Republicans and seven in 10 of them voted for Bush. By contrast, in
Massachusetts, nearly six in 10 of the voters described themselves
as independents, and seven in 10 of them backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that either candidate had cut into the
other's constituency. Those who described themselves as
conservatives, and those who want abortion to be illegal, voted for
Bush; those calling themselves moderates or liberals, as well as
those who favor abortion rights, favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his feisty speech Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, Bush repeatedly
cited Gore and struggled to contain a satisfied grin. ``American
must not give Clinton &UR; - &LR; Gore four more years,'' he said, reciting a
list of ills of the current administration. And, pointedly, he
raised Gore's fund-raising troubles, saying, ``I will remind Al
Gore that Americans do not want a White House where there is no
controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   At boisterous rally in Nashville earlier in the evening, Gore
praised Bradley, saying he was ``moved and touched'' by his rival's
commitment to healing racial divisions.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore put forth an unvarnished plea for the
independents and Republicans who backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And in an unmistakable dig at Bush, the vice president also
depicted Republicans as intolerant. ``In this election, we are the
party of the mainstream,'' he said. ``We are the party of hope. We
appeal to hope, not anger, not to exclusion. We look to the future,
not the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tuesday night, Gore had begun concentrating his
assaults on Bush, while the governor had softened his conservative
oratory in recent days, positioning himself for the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   While the days leading up to Tuesday's primaries had been
dominated by McCain's repudiation of religious right leaders and
Bush's apology for his much-ridiculed appearance at Bob Jones
University _ an institution that is viewed as anti-Catholic _ there
was no sign in the exit polls that those episodes significantly
affected the voting. Bush held his own among Catholics, although he
did not do as well with them as with other groups.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain's attacks on the religious right appeared to be a
mistaken gambit _ or one that did not yield him new support among
more moderate voters. In New York and Ohio, people who said
McCain's criticisms mattered backed Bush; those who said they did
not matter backed McCain. In New York, six in 10 voters said
McCain's outspoken comments did not affect their vote; in Ohio,
nearly half said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who was harshly
attacked by McCain, said Tuesday night that he had been
``absolutely dumbfounded when Senator McCain had come to my home
town and launched that barrage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to destroy his campaign, and I didn't know
why he did it,'' he said in an interview with the Fox News Channel.
``To attack 25, 30 percent of your base just isn't smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he was opposed to a Bush-McCain ticket. Asked
whether he thought such an alliance were out of the question, he
replied, ``I really think so. That kind of anger, the concept that
there are people who are agents of evil, that kind of thing isn't
civility in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case throughout the contest, voters said they
were more concerned about candidates' morals than about issues.
While McCain was widely seen as someone who stands up for his
beliefs and tells people the truth, Bush was seen as having high
moral values.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio and Missouri, two pivotal battlegrounds in the fall,
Bush did extraordinarily well. In those states, Bush won the
backing of men and women, the young and old, voters who are
educated and those who are not, and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, where a quarter of the Republican electorate is
Catholic, Bush drew half their vote and McCain took just under
half. In Missouri, where Catholics account for a quarter of the
vote, more than half favored Bush and less than four in 10 backed
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nationwide sweep was especially welcome for him since his
campaign has endured its share of traumas. While Gore has been
elected to two terms as vice president and served in the House and
Senate from Tennessee for 16 years, he was not prepared for
Bradley's sudden emergence last year. That led him to dramatically
retool his campaign from top to bottom, shifting his campaign
headquarters from Washington to Nashville, distancing himself from
President Clinton and significantly loosening up his style on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was unrelenting in finding holes in Bradley's
record and in his proposals _ and put Bradley on the defensive for
several weeks before the former senator responded.
</P>
<P>
   The voters Tuesday gave Bradley high marks for saying what was
on his mind regardless of the political price he might pay; they
viewed Gore as more of a panderer.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bradley had little backing anywhere among any
demographic group and failed to leave his mark in any significant
way.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Republicans, Democrats said they were more
concerned with a candidate's standing on the issues than his
personal qualities. In a sign that the Clinton impeachment hearings
may still loom, Clinton was seen as doing a good job by more than
eight in 10 of the Democrats who voted. But only one in four rated
him favorably as a person.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the fervent backing of New York's Republican
establishment, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas wrestled his way to
victory Tuesday over John McCain in a state that had just last week
seemed fertile ground for the senator from Arizona. Bush won a
solid majority of both the delegates and the total Republican votes
in the state's first contested presidential primary since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, New York: You have just pushed George W. Bush
over the top to be the next president of the United States,'' Gov.
George Pataki of New York declared at a victory rally in Manhattan,
looking visibly relieved as he celebrated an outcome on which
Pataki arguably had as much riding as Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, a presidential primary that had
uncustomarily been almost lost in the shadow of the Republican
fight fizzled to an end, as Vice President Al Gore swamped Bill
Bradley in a state where Bradley, too, once thought he had a real
opportunity to derail a candidate backed by the party
establishment. Bradley did not even wait for half the votes to be
counted, appearing before a somber audience of supporters in
Manhattan to both concede and signal his imminent withdrawal from
his race.
</P>
<P>
   The results in the Republican primary in New York offered a
dramatic conclusion to a political struggle that in the space of
two weeks revealed strains not only in the national Republican
Party, as Bush and McCain engaged in pitched and personal battle on
the state's airwaves, but in New York's Republican organization as
well. The differences in New York were at least momentarily set
aside in victory Tuesday night, as Pataki appeared on stage with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had scorned Pataki for guiding a Bush
campaign in New York that was based on attacking McCain's voting
record.
</P>
<P>
   By initial indications, at least, Pataki's strategy _ combined
with a Republican primary system designed to help the candidate
backed by the party establishment _ appears to have served Bush
well. A series of public polls over the past few days suggested
that McCain, who presented himself as a moderate, was tied with
Bush in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The final result was not that close. In New York, Republicans
vote not for candidates but for 93 delegates. With 98 percent of
the precincts counted last night, Bush had 67 delegates, compared
to 26 for McCain. A third candidate, Alan Keyes, had not won any
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   A tally of the popular vote found that with 97 percent of the
districts counted, Bush had 50.4 percent of the votes cast for
delegates and McCain had 43.7 percent, according to unofficial
results. Keyes had 3.5 percent, and Steve Forbes, whose name
remained on the ballot, even though he has withdrawn from the race,
2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The percentages reflect the number of votes cast for delegates
supporting each candidate, and Republicans could select up to three
delegates.

McCain with a crowd of supporters in Los Angeles. With rival, Gov.
George W. Bush, piling up delegates and winning key contests across
the nation, including New York, McCain was left facing an agonizing
decision Tuesday night: how long and how far to prolong a campaign
that has evolved over 14 months from an underrated candidacy into
what he calls his mission to transform the Republican party. McCain
did not tip his hand and opted instead to congratulate Bush by
saying, ``we may meet again in primaries a few days from now.''

 NEW YORK: three delegates.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain did better in New York City suburbs and wealthy areas of
the city than Bush, with McCain apparently winning four of the six
delegates in Suffolk County, according to the state Board of
Elections. In fact, a war horse of Republican politics in New York,
state Sen. Roy Goodman of the Upper East Side, lost in his bid to
become one of Bush's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   New York was the second-largest of the states holding primaries
Tuesday, and one in which Bush's strength had long been suspect.
The stakes were particularly high in the state for Pataki and the
state Republican Party, which had orchestrated a tough campaign
against McCain, first attempting, without success, to keep McCain
off the New York ballot, and then orchestrating a series of attacks
on McCain that many Republicans, including Giuliani, a candidate
for the U.S.Senate, described as overly negative.
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions of Bush's win was seized as something of a
vindication by Pataki and his aides, who made no effort to hide
their feelings at the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, I'm relieved,'' Pataki confessed after leaving the
stage. ``This was a tough one.''
</P>
<P>
   His chief strategist, Zenia Mucha, said that in watching the
exit polls during the day, which suggested at times suggested a
dead heat, ``I must have died a thousand deaths.'' Mucha made the
sign of the cross as she made the remark.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The state Conservative Party leader, Michael Long, declared that
Pataki ``pulled this one out for George W. Bush,'' and questioned
why Giuliani had been allowed on the stage. ``The mayor was missing
in action, sight unseen,'' said Long, who has declined &UR;  &LR; to endorse
Giuliani in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters were critical of the tone of the Bush
campaign and distressed at the results.
</P>
<P>
   But Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and the
head of McCain's New York effort, struck a conciliatory tone. ``We
are disappointed, we thought we would do better, but we are
Republicans and the game plan here is to coalesce around whoever
the candidate is,'' he said ``If John McCain decides he is not
going forward, we will support George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote brought an end to hectic contest that offered the world
a detailed glimpse at the complexity of a New York election system
designed, in ways obvious and not, to help incumbents and the party
leaders, which was to the clear benefit of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The first manifestation of this came with the ballot fight, when
Bush's main supporters in New York, Pataki and William D. Powers,
the state Republican chairman, tried to protect Bush from having to
endure what would be the first competitive Republican presidential
primary since Gerald Ford ran for election in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy collapsed when a judge ordered the ballot opened up
to McCain and other Republican challengers. But once McCain won
that battle, a new one emerged in the form of the convoluted way in
which the Republican Party conducts its primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a statewide vote on the candidates _ the customary
way elections are conducted in the nation _ Republicans cast their
votes in 31 congressional districts, and not for the candidates
themselves, but the three delegates and three alternates pledged to
them. The candidates' names appeared in tiny type under the names
of the delegates who, in Bush's case, tended to be well-known
elected officials selected to run by the state Republican machine.
Aside from the 93 delegates, party leaders select another eight
at-large delegates.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Democratic vote was much more clear-cut, with
the names of Bradley and Gore appearing in bold type at the top of
the ballot, followed by the names of their delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The system was applauded by Bush's supporters, who said it
provided the Texas governor a major tactical advantage over McCain.
Whether or not that was true, it proved to be a matter of
frustration to Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insane!'' declared Joseph Goldman, 55 of Great Neck, flipping
his eye glasses off and on as he strained to figure out how to vote
for McCain. ``This was just horrific. I never in my life saw
anything like this. You had to look at at this itsy bitsy print.''

MARINERS LACK BIG PLUG FOR GAPING OUTFIELD HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Maybe it was intentional that the Anaheim Angels
decided against parading Jim Edmonds and Garrett Anderson in front
of the Mariners Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two outfielders were on the bench at Diablo Stadium during
Seattle's 5-3 win, putting a crimp in the Mariners' window
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, the talk around town was that the Cactus League game
would provide the American League West Division rivals an
opportunity to peruse the goods, in case the urge to swap escalated
into a mandate to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels need pitching and the Mariners need someone they can
count on in the outfield _ and we mean (BEGIN ITAL) really count
on, (END ITAL) as in power, as in a threat, as in homers and RBIs
and 150-plus games this summer.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems unlikely either rival would help make the other
one better, stranger things have happened. And if the Angels and
M's can't or won't make a deal, then the Mariners no doubt have a
few aces in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   For the M's, spring training is revealing that the loss of Ken
Griffey Jr. may no longer be emotionally wrenching. But that does
not eliminate the cold, hard fact that without No. 24, the Mariners
outfield is, well, a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a bunch of outfielders. Something definitely has to
be done, and that's too bad,'' said Brian Hunter, whose arbitration
win this winter makes his $2 million salary tough for the M's to
swallow if Hunter can't improve his on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of guys here who've worked hard to be here.
I know Lou (Piniella) is so good at putting in the best lineup to
win a game, but there are a lot of us here. I think that's why
they're still trying to make moves,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a question of who's in the Mariners outfield as much as
who isn't: In Peoria are Jay Buhner, Stan Javier, Raul Ibanez, Mark
McLemore, Mike Cameron, John Mabry and Hunter, not to mention four
others with minor league contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Amassing such a horde, however, has not delivered a truly
durable, reliable and productive outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, the Mariners have so many outfielders in camp that
Piniella has already said it's time to farm some of the fellas out
to create adequate playing time among the core group of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   If the luxury of penciling No. 24 into the lineup every single
day didn't spoil Piniella, he has certainly realized that this
abrupt transition to outfield by committee is a less-than-perfect
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go with what we have, I can rotate guys in, keep them
fresh. I'm comfortable with what we have. and I'm willing to go
with what we've got,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would think that we could use one more outfielder that
can be what you would consider an everyday force in your lineup. I
think we would be better served.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment of an eventual deal for another outfielder is
percolating throughout camp. And it is tough to forget the delight
with which Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln a few weeks ago announced
that, in addition to all the moves made this winter, the M's are
not done yet.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the M's are spending these first weeks of
spring playing a shell game. They are trying to determine all their
spare parts, knowing that they need to make a move for an
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   John Halama, who pitched three strong innings Tuesday in a ``B''
game against the Milwaukee Brewers, has been talking about trade
rumors that would send him to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But the M's have to guess right as to which pitcher to let go.
Tuesday, general manager Pat Gillick indicated that until he sees
Brett Tomko work a few games, it is too early to trade away
pitching, even if the M's appear to have an abundance of it right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the No. 1 need is undeniable. And it is out where a guy
named Junior used to help out Buhner in right field, where he
compensated for the 68 left fielders who played next to him during
Griffey's 11 seasons in Seattle.

   ``I'm always open to getting better,'' Gillicks said. ``We could
get better with another left-handed hitter. But a lot of that
depends on what (Raul) Ibanez and (John) Mabry do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick says a left-handed power hitter with a track record for
production who plays ``average defense'' is their top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'd feel safer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose some 130 RBI, we're going to have to replace
that. ... I think everyone can kind of lock into who the starters
are, the infield and the catchers, but one area of experiment, of
uncertainty, is what the outfield will be,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Griffey told the M's to trade him to Cincinnati, everyone
had had months to resign themselves to the reality of his
departure. But what to do in Griffey's absence is still a problem _
one the Mariners seem aimed at fixing.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to good guys like Ibanez and Mabry, Cameron and
McLemore and Javier, but so far it is clear the M's do not have
anything resembling Griffey's replacement.

image overhead, a crowd of supporters of Gov. George W. Bush listen
in as the Republican front-runner gave his victory speech on
``Super Tuesday.'' With Bush piling up delegates and winning key

tireless predictions that the governor would win the nomination

they had always wanted to: toward November and Vice President Al

Detective Robert Williams of the Rocky Mount Police Department.
``Most times burglars walk right up to the front door, kick it in

MAKE LENT PAINLESS WITH THIS SACRIFICIAL `MISS LIST'

<TEXT>
<P>
   As kids, my brother and sisters and I would always have to give
up five pleasurable things during Lent as a sign of our Christian
self-discipline. I once promised to give up lentils till my mom
reminded me I had never eaten lentils in my life. Still, it became
a game among my siblings and me to forgo something we wouldn't
really miss. In that spirit of sacrifice on the EZ plan, I hereby
abstain from the following during this Lenten season:
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence.'' After panning the first few episodes last year,
I confessed that I'd somehow become addicted to this weekly taste
of treacle, maybe because I grew up in Rhode Island. It certainly
wasn't because of the writing, which Melina Kanakaredes praised
effusively at the TV Guide Awards Sunday night, but which is about
as engaging as the fine print on a car-rental agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.'' The party's over. Time for
Regis to pack it in and go looking for a successor to Kathie Lee. I
realize he just signed a new big-bucks contract with ABC, which
means ``Millionaire'' will overstay its welcome by a factor of
jeezlouise, but when I'm surfing these days and I come across the
all-too-familiar set with its high-tech gloss and overwrought
music, my reaction registers somewhere between torpor and
phlegmaticness. This is partly good, because I like to use the word
phlegmatic, but bad for ABC because I hit the remote faster than
you can say, ``Is that your vinyl ant, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal.'' Hard to believe I used to rearrange my schedule
to see this show. Now Monday night rolls around and I don't even
remember it's on. Maybe it's just me, cuz the show is still Fox's
most-watched, but I prefer to remember the likable characters from
the first season, not the unpleasant narcissists they've become.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files.'' Don't tell anyone, but it actually became the
``Ex-Files'' for me sometime last season. Maybe it was the move to
L.A., maybe it was just the ennui creeping in during the sixth
season. Or maybe the truth really isn't out there in the ether.
It's in ``Roswell,'' on The WB.

RED WINGS APPROVE OF BOURQUE TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Detroit Red Wings are disappointed they didn't
get veteran defenseman Ray Bourque from the Boston Bruins, but they
are happy he went to Colorado instead of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the Red Wings don't think they will catch the Blues
for the top spot in the Western Conference, entering Tuesday five
points behind St. Louis in the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   Division winners are the first three seeds in the playoffs. The
Red Wings are fourth and would face No. 5 Phoenix if the postseason
began today.
</P>
<P>
   The Los AngelesKings, one point back at No. 6, could have moved
ahead of the Coyotes on Tuesday after Phoenix was shut out by St.
Louis 4-0. But the Kings weren't able to beat Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's new team, the Avalanche, came in seventh overall but
routed No. 9 Calgary 8-3 and moved ahead of Edmonton into first
place in the Northwest Division. The Avs and Oilers each have 73
points, but Colorado (31-27-10) has a better winning percentage
than Edmonton (25-27-15).
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was traded along with forward Dave Andreychuk for
forward Brian Rolston, defenseman Martin Grenier, center Sami
Pahlsson and Boston's choice of a first-round pick in either 2000
or 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a pitch for him,'' Detroit general manager Ken Holland
said. ``The price was a little too steep.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues would have teamed Bourque with Al MacInnis on their
second defensive unit. St. Louis' top defensive unit is Norris
Trophy favorite Chris Pronger and Marc Bergevin.
</P>
<P>
   First-round playoff victories, however would set up a showdown
between Detroit and St. Louis in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, 39, can be an unrestricted free agent after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Smolinski back: Kings second-line center Bryan Smolinski was
back in action Tuesday with two stitches near his left eye. He had
no problems from the corneal abrasion he suffered in the second
period Saturday against Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski spent more than a minute on the ice after he was
struck in the face by Nashville's Greg Johnson. Johnson received a
four-minute minor penalty and Smolinski was done for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The eye cleared overnight, but the Kings did not practice
Sunday. He worked out Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never was a problem, it cleared up right away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski does not wear a visor, which is standard equipment in
junior and college hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys get to the NHL and they take them off forever,''
Kings coach Andy Murray said. ``I'm not sure why.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick whistles: Kings defenseman Mattias Norstrom often gets
overlooked because he is not a scorer. But Norstrom's plus-minus is
plus-20, the highest by a King since 1990-91 when Wayne Gretzky was
plus-30. . . . Donald Audette was a healthy scratch for the second
consecutive game. . . . Nashville ended Luc Robitaille's scoring
streak at 15 on Saturday by limiting his access to open ice. The
Red Wings did the same, holding Robitaille without a shot in the
first period.

President Al Gore has revived his fortunes. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   ELN-BUSH (Austin, Texas) _ Nearly five weeks ago, when Gov.
George W. Bush's grip on the Republican presidential nomination
looked tenuous, he indulged in the most controversial symbolism of
his campaign and appeared at Bob Jones University, a conservative
Christian school in South Carolina that still barred interracial
dating. But Tuesday night, as the Texas governor basked in several
key victories that put him in what he clearly felt was a very

surprised by the vigorous pace of reform from the president, who

   PUERTORICO-CUISINE (San Juan) _ Walking into the Casita Blanca
Restaurant is like walking into a country home, one with ceiling
fans, bare cement floors and live poultry _ in this case a turkey
named Gabino and a rooster known as Pancho _ roaming the indoor
patio. In this small restaurant in the working-class neighbhorhood
of Villa Palmeras, Jesus Perez has created something that is simple
yet rare: a place where you can taste the distinctive flavors of
Puerto Rican cuisine, the traditional dishes that are almost
impossible to find outside of a home _ even here on the island. By
Mireya Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   RESTAURANT-CREDITS (New York) _ There was a time when chefs were
anonymous. No one knew their names. If a restaurant was named Chez
Louis, chances were that Louis was not the guy behind the stove. He
was the owner. When anyone dared to ask Henri Soule, the owner of
Le Pavillon, who was responsible for the greatness of his
restaurant, he had a very simple answer: ``Le Pavillon,'' he would
say, ``c'est moi.'' I found myself thinking about those far-off
days while studying the menu at Thalia recently. Down at the
bottom, the name of the chef is printed. And next to the chef,
Michael Otsuka, his sous-chefs, Bill McDaniel and Robert Martin.
Sous-chefs? The United States has often been called a credit
society. It's true in two senses. Americans love credit cards. And
they love credit _ the recognition of accomplishment,
near-accomplishment, well-intended lack of accomplishment or merely
showing up. In a success-ethic democracy, it just doesn't feel
right unless everybody wins and trophies are handed out all around.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
The Suns couldn't contain themselves and didn't try. When
recruiting Penny Hardaway, they came up with a ``Backcourt 2000''
label for the combination of Hardaway and Jason Kidd and plastered
it everywhere Hardaway's wandering eyes might have strayed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It worked to woo Hardaway, and the combination has lived up to
that breathless billing. But for 42 minutes Tuesday, ``Backcourt
2000'' was outplayed by Backcourt 2001 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway and Kidd could not slow the Rockets' Cuttino Mobley,
Shandon Anderson and, especially, Steve Francis. The Rockets held a
lead heading down the stretch, and there did not seem to be
anything the Suns could do to stop the Rockets guards.
</P>
<P>
   But with the game on the line, the Suns who do not come with a
marketing slogan, shoe commercial or look-alike puppet suddenly
emerged from the backcourt shadow and carried Phoenix to a 108-101
win at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real frustrating,'' Francis said. ``We played them a good
game. We played hard the whole game. We went up a couple early. We
led throughout the second half. And we still couldn't close the
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis had a season-high 32 points. Anderson and Mobley
combined for 34. But the Suns' frontcourt would not let the Rockets
get a defensive rebound for the last six minutes as Phoenix came
back to literally take the win from the Rockets' grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those rebounds in the fourth quarter were ones we
should have gotten,'' Mobley said. ``They were tipping it to each
other and playing hard and came out and beat us in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last six minutes, the Suns scored as many points after
missed shots, eight, as the Rockets scored overall. As loaded as
the Suns are with scorers _ six hit for double figures while
playing their second game in as many nights Tuesday _ the Rockets
gave them extra shots until they were shot down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do that, they have so many different weapons,''
Anderson said. ``Every guy is capable of doing something to hurt
you. They exploited us.''
</P>
<P>
   The inability to stop the Suns late ruined an otherwise
spectacular showing by the Rockets' backcourt against the guard
tandem considered the league's best.
</P>
<P>
   A week after a shooting slump had made him 4-of-29 over three
games, Francis made 13 of 21 shots and six of 11 3-pointers. Facing
Kidd, a first-team All-NBA defender last season, he scored 17
points in the third quarter and collected eight assists and four
steals for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is the same,'' Francis said of his shooting
turnaround. ``I was just missing shots. Of course, when you're
slumping, you come in earlier and stay later, and that's what I've
been doing. And I think it's been paying off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, isolated through much of the first half, made five of 13
shots for 14 points. Anderson made nine of 15 shots for 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could take them every single time, every time,'' Mobley
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the ``Backcourt 2000'' label, Mobley responded, ``Is
that so? Yeah, well, OK. We respect them, of course. We're not
going to talk about that. But people know what we're building.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets led by four midway through the fourth quarter. But
they could not get a stop for six minutes, until there were 31
seconds remaining and the Suns held a 106-101 lead.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say the Suns never missed. But for six minutes,
they rebounded each of their four missed shots to keep shooting
until the Rockets could not keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gugliotta, who finished with 23 points and 12 rebounds,
twice followed Suns misses inside. Hardaway beat the shot clock
with a running nine-footer. And with 3:40 left, Hardaway found
Cliff Robinson in the corner for a 3 and a 98-95 Suns lead.
</P>
<P>
   Francis set up cutting center Kelvin Cato for a slam. But
Hardaway, who had 24 points and 10 assists, came right back with a
drive to the hole to push the Suns' lead to 100-97 with 3:06 left.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of a timeout, the Rockets threw the ball away, giving
the Suns an opening to take their lead to five points, their
largest since the first half. As damaging, however, the Suns burned
a full minute doing it, with Gugliotta grabbing his third offensive
rebound in three minutes to allow Rodney Rogers to nail a tough
fadeaway on the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Francis quickly scored on a drive. But Rogers was fouled and
nailed two free throws to push the Phoenix lead back to five.
Francis then lost the ball on a drive, and Rogers grabbed another
miss and scored, giving the Suns a 106-99 lead with 55.8 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   The layup gave Rogers six points in a span of 71 seconds. For
the game, he made all five of his shots and all four of his free
throws to score 15 points in 32 minutes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have many perfect games in this league,'' Rogers
said. ``When you come off the bench in the fourth quarter, you have
to make things happen. I scored some points and got some big
rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis scored on another drive. And the Rockets got a last
chance when Robinson stepped out of bounds. But Francis' 3 swam all
over the rim and fell out. Hakeem Olajuwon left his follow short,
and Kidd put the game way with free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good scoring game,'' Francis said. ``But it hurt us
to lose a game like that. We were not rebounding very well near the
end. We could have had control of the game, but we just didn't make
the plays.''

KINGS LACK BITE DURING HOMESTAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings could have moved into fifth
place in the Western Conference playoff race with a victory
Tuesday. The Detroit Red Wings had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   They smothered the Kings 3-1 in front of a sellout crowd of
18,118 at the Staples Center, avenging two February losses and
nearly giving the Kings their first shutout loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jere Karalahti broke that up with 7:17 left in the
game, his fifth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It gave the Kings a lift and stirred the fans, especially when
Detroit's Brendan Shanahan was whistled off just two minutes later
for interference.
</P>
<P>
   But they could not net the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings pulled their goaltender with 1:09 remaining for an
extra skater, and Rob Blake quickly took a slapshot from the point
that was gloved by Detroit's Chris Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings called timeout but lost the faceoff in the Red Wings'
zone. Shanahan and Steve Yzerman played with the puck before giving
it to Pat Verbeek who scored with 58.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are still sixth with 73 points, but they are just four
points from being out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They now are 1-2-1 four games into their longest homestand of
the year. The Kings' only road game until March 23 is at the Pond
in Anaheim. This was the time when they were supposed to eliminate
the suspense. But they clearly are not taking advantage.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1:47 stretch of the first period, the Kings allowed two
goals that decided the game. One was short-handed by Sergei Fedorov
with 15:16 gone in the period that beat goaltender Jamie Storr and
took the crowd out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Storr was replacing Stephane Fiset, who was placed on injured
reserve Monday with a strained right groin suffered Saturday
against lowly Nashville. The Kings won that game, 3-2 in overtime
on a goal by Jozef Stumpel, but it didn't hide that the club is
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which now has five consecutive victories, just drove
home the point.
</P>
<P>
   When the two met Feb. 18 in Detroit, the Kings won 3-2 to extend
their winning streak to a season-high five games. They withstood
the taunting of Red Wings muscleman Darren McCarty and were the
more disciplined team.
</P>
<P>
   Although they dropped the next two, they finished strong on
their longest road trip in seven years. The momentum hasn't carried
over.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Red Wings defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom made it 1-0 when
he took a pass from Mathieu Dandenault, skated through the slot and
fired it over Storr's right shoulder at the 13:29 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings weren't generating much offense, taking just seven
shots on Osgood in the first period. Three came from long range by
Rob Blake, but the first line of Stumpel, Luc Robitaille, Ziggy
Pallfy had just one combined in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   By taking away the Kings' first unit, Detroit also controlled
their power play, which was 0 for 4 through the first 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With few scoring opportunities, Fedorov's short-handed goal made
the Red Wings' two-goal lead seem almost insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up the puck from Lidstrom in his own end and skated up
the right side untouched. Fedorov closed in and beat Storr over the
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Detroit (40-20-7) still is five points behind
St. Louis in the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   Their only loss during their winning streak was in the
acquisition of Boston's veteran defenseman Ray Bourque, who was
traded to Colorado instead.

TWO vastly different scripts will play out in America's hoops
heartland this week, although the stakes are virtually the same.
The Big 12's postseason exercise in maximizing revenue should
ultimately decide no more than Missouri's fate vis-a-vis the NCAA
Tournament, while Conference USA's one-thoroughbred race figures to
make or break Tulane's March Madness aspirations.

<P>
   Yep, that's about it in terms of hard-core significance. But at
least in Kansas City, the ball will be a blast. Memphis' C-USA
party is less a sports event than it is a coronation. It's
basically Hugs' monsters against a bunch of fellows who need hugs.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, C-USA ranks a lofty fifth among all conferences in the
power ratings, but that's greatly skewed by Cincinnati's No. 1
individual status. Bob Huggins' Bearcats, 16-0 during the league's
regular season, finished with six more victories than any of their
alleged rivals. And their three games at the Pyramid figure to be
the equivalent of a BCS-bound football team's full-contact
post-Christmas scrimmages. The idea is to work in a little extra
conditioning while making sure nobody gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-2 Bearcats' season of consequence starts the following
weekend in round two of the NCAAs, the round in which they have met
their demise the past three springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``See you in Indy!'' Cincy's fans chanted late in the Cats'
84-41 billy-clubbing of Saint Louis' Billikens on Saturday, and
that's exactly where they must wind up for the year to be judged
anything approaching a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the nation, nobody cares about Cincinnati,'' said Pete
Mickeal, circling the wagons on behalf of his fellow Bearcats.
``The perception is we'll just lose in the second round.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-deserved perception, until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   For Tulane, however, the trip to Memphis means more than just a
chance to drop by Graceland. Although the Green Wave ``won''
C-USA's National Conference with an 8-8 record and a tiebreaker
advantage over Marquette, considering the Greenies' triple-digit
RPI, it's surely RIP for them unless they beat Cincinnati to reach
the tournament final. And even that might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   If not, then just three conference teams will go to the Dance.
Louisville, with an 8-1 finish, and DePaul, despite seven
conference losses, are both safely in on the strength of their
power ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophical question: Shouldn't the No. 5-rated league merit
at least a quartet of Tournament spots? After all, the third-ranked
Big 12 is a lock for five, and Missouri, a much stronger bubble
team than Tulane, would make six.
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatic answer: No.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is look at the standings _ and the AP Top 25
_ to see why the discrepancy is justified. While C-USA's
second-tier teams (that is to say all of them relative to Cincy)
were busily beating each other up, the Big 12 clearly separated its
haves from the have-nots. Five teams went 11-5 or better in the
conference, and four finished comfortably ensconced in the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, none of the latter was Kansas, a lowly 24th.
</P>
<P>
   For the previous three seasons of the Big 12's existence, the
mighty Jayhawks went to KC much as Cincinnati now marches into
Memphis. This week, their presence is somewhat plebeian. They're
even being required to play a first-round game Thursday afternoon,
an affront to Phog Allen's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, seventh-ranked Iowa State goes in seeded No. 1 on the
wings of its first conference title since the end of World War II.
In reality, however, Texas (13th), Oklahoma (15th) and Oklahoma
State (17th) are Nos. 1a, 1b and 1c _ you pick the order _ setting
up a Saturday-Sunday brawl certain to be as exhausting for the fans
as it will be for the players.
</P>
<P>
   That, ironically, is the only downside to the Big 12's emerging
democracy. The eventual champion may be so drained physically and
emotionally that it will have little gas left for the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   While Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy said upon the conclusion
of the regular season, ``The hard part's over,'' it's not. The
Cyclones have the league's strongest starting five but drop off
measurably in depth, making them seem badly suited for the
three-days, three-games battle ahead of them. Although they're
obviously good enough to make the final, you can argue they won't
have enough left to prevail should they get there, even with a
virtual free pass vs. Nebraska or Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   With Kansas, Colorado and Missouri likely first-day opponents
for the Big 12's three other big-four teams, it's going to be a
compelling dogfight _ but one laden with pedigree. In Memphis, on
the other hand, Elvis is more likely to sing the national anthem
Saturday than Cincinnati is to lose.

CALIFORNIA   VOTERS OK MARRIAGE MEASURE, APPROVE INDIAN GAMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Gay marriage was overwhelmingly rejected in
early returns and Proposition 22 was projected in exit polls as a
clear winner Tuesday, as California voters approved barring legally
recognizing same-sex marriages in the state even if other states do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns showed Proposition 1A, the Indian gaming measure,
headed toward victory along with four public works bond issues and
an initiative that toughens penalties for juveniles who commit
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 25, the campaign finance reform measure, and
Proposition 26, a measure reducing the majority needed to pass
school bonds from two-thirds to one-half of votes cast plus one
vote, both were trailing, along with two measures easing
restrictions on ``bad faith'' lawsuits against insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican state Sen. W.J. ``Pete'' Knight of Palmdale, who
authored Proposition 22, said he was delighted by the affirmation
that state law defines marriage only as the union between a man and
a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy the people of the state of California decided they
didn't want to change the definition of marriage as the union
between a man and a woman, which has worked for civilization for
thousands of years and has been shown to be the best unit in which
to raise kids,'' said Knight, who is the father of a gay son.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Proposition 22, who argued that the measure was
anti-gay, were not officially commenting, said spokeswoman Tracey
Conaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, we're heartbroken,'' said Esperanza Macias, field
coordinator for No-on-22. ``But this is far from over.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the state ballot measure was intended as a
simple, 14-word formula for the protection and affirmation of the
institution of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intention to hurt anyone, no intention to be
divisive, no hidden agenda,'' said Knight, saying his relationship
with his son remains a private family matter and that the only
emotion he felt was joy over the measure's passage.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, however, kindled complex reactions among those who
viewed it as a symbolic, and therefore hurtful, affront to
homosexuals. It quickly became the year's flashpoint among the 20
propositions, overshadowing a series of fiscal measures.
</P>
<P>
   No other state recognizes same-sex marriages, but 30 other
states have passed laws much like Proposition 22 as a defensive
move after a case involving same-sex marriage reached Hawaii's
Supreme Court in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   All states currently recognize only marriage between a man and a
woman. California's law, however, requires the state to recognize
legally performed marriages in other states, including common-law
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In other issues, voters indicated they were prepared to crack
down harder on juvenile crime, with Proposition 21 leading in early
returns.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed overhaul of the juvenile justice system, sponsored
by former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, would give prosecutors,
rather than juvenile court judges, the power to decide whether
teens age 14 to 17 would be tried as adults for serious crimes, and
would limit judges' discretion in sending youths for treatment
rather than to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the propositions with the biggest impact on Californian
taxpayers - Propositions 12 through 16, authorizing $4.6 billion in
new bonds for water, park, library and other projects - were
winning in early returns. Only Proposition 15, which would provide
$220 million for new crime labs, was lagging.
</P>
<P>
   The bond issues, in total, are estimated to cost each state
resident about $10 a year for the next quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a series of school scandals in the Los Angeles
Unified School District, Proposition 26 - the measure that would
reduce from two-thirds to a simple majority the votes needed for
local school bonds - was failing.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns had the state's latest campaign finance measure -
which included limits on who can contribute to campaigns, and how
much - trailing. Proposition 25 would ban corporate campaign
contributions, and provide partial public financing.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were overwhelmingly turning down Proposition 28, an
effort to rescind a 50-cents-a-pack cigarette tax passed in 1998.
Ned Roscoe of the Cigarettes Cheaper! discount chain had challenged
the tax sponsored by film director Rob Reiner. The tax had been
estimate to generate some $650 million a year in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running debate over Indian gaming in the state took a
big step toward resolution, with early returns showing Proposition
1A, which would expand tribal gambling, ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A related measure, Proposition 29, was far closer, but tribal
representatives have said if 1A passes, the outcome of Proposition
29 will not matter.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also appeared to be rejecting two propositions, 30 and
31, that would uphold new state laws giving victims in an accident
the right to file ``bad faith'' lawsuits against the other party's
insurer for denial or delay of legitimate claims.

SONICS BOUNCE DALLAS WITH SUBS SUPPLYING STIFF-ARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dennis Rodman, with blue and blond streaks in his
hair, dove around, engaged the crowd and rebounded like a madman.
</P>
<P>
   The eccentric forward apparently is cutting back on the
technical fouls and suspensions that have characterized his brief
stint with the Dallas Mavericks. But that isn't to say that the
Sonics' 101-86 victory Tuesday night was a quiet foray up and down
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton blew his fuse, then Ruben Patterson made the place
go pop to start a lengthy home-stand the way the Sonics envisioned:
With a bang.
</P>
<P>
   The game also was bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was ejected in the third quarter, and the Sonics played
most of the second half without three starters. So Patterson used
the opportunity to score a career-high 32 points _ 16 of which came
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson did his damage mostly without Payton, Vin Baker and
Horace Grant on the floor. With Payton banished to the locker room,
Baker sitting in foul trouble and Grant hurt, Patterson deprived
the surging Mavs of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that Ruben can't shoot. They were just
backing off him, and he was just shooting at the basket,'' Sonics
coach Paul Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruben can shoot those open shots. We just don't want him
shooting a lot of shots off the dribble.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson attacked Dallas' defense and made six of nine shots in
the final frame. He shot 12-for-20 overall and had eight rebounds
and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a zone,'' Patterson said. ``I said to myself I had
to step up. I was telling the guys to get (the ball) to me, and
they did.''
</P>
<P>
   All Payton got was a hard time in the second half. He gave the
officials a hassle, too.
</P>
<P>
   Payton picked up his fifth foul _ an offensive infraction _ with
54.7 seconds remaining in the third. He went to the bench for a
substitution but didn't leave quietly. Payton's comments from the
bench led to his second technical foul and an automatic ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Payton had received his first technical five minutes earlier
after arguing another offensive foul called against him. He left
with a near triple-double (19 points, nine assists, eight rebounds)
in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was already out after he suffered a hyperextended right
elbow with 3:28 left in the third period. The Sonics were left to
count on the ability of their bench when Vin Baker picked up his
fifth foul with 7:20 left in the game. He did not return.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sonics led 83-73 at that point, and a lineup that
featured Patterson, Brent Barry, Emanual Davis, Greg Foster and
Rashard Lewis more than held off the Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some guys on this team who are capable of having some
big nights for us,'' Baker said. ``Those guys work hard in
practice. They're dedicated, and it showed tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics broke two trends Tuesday night. They jumped on the
Mavs early instead of getting off to another of the slow starts
that have plagued them in five previous games. And the win over a
soft opponent bucked a trend of home losses to marginal teams.
</P>
<P>
   This is the result the Sonics are looking for this month as they
play 11 of their next 13 at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is like us cashing a dividend check,'' said
Westphal, whose team moved back into sixth place in the Western
Conference standings because Minnesota lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked hard on the road, and we have a chance to make
our record very good now by taking care of business at home.When
you get a team like Dallas coming in ... you need to get those
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the Sonics had demoralized the Mavs in the first
half. Ahead 25-20 in the second quarter, they put together a 19-3
spurt and ran away from the Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a barrage sparked mostly by Payton, Patterson and a
disruptive defense.
</P>
<P>
   Give the Sonics credit for aggressive ball-hawking, but the Mavs
committed several unforced errors during that stretch. At one
point, they threw the ball away on four consecutive possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas committed seven of its 21 turnovers in the second
quarter, and the Sonics had a 55-33 lead just before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been having good starts at home, so I really wasn't
worried about the start of the game,'' Westphal said. ``I was more
worried about Dallas getting hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, without incident, collected 15 rebounds, and the
Mavericks made a couple of runs in the second half. They got to
within eight points in the third and within nine with 9:25 left in
the game. Then Davis sank a 3-pointer to extend the lead, and
Patterson sealed the game by scoring the Sonics' final 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hitting everything,'' Patterson said. ``I'm glad I
got my career high.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics needed the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   TIP-INS: The Sonics activated guard Vernon Maxwell Tuesday and
placed forward Chuck Person on the injured list. Maxwell had missed
29 games because of arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. Person
has torn cartilage in his left knee ... The start time for a game
Sunday against Toronto has been changed to 3 p.m. to accommodate a
national broadcast on NBC ... Dallas forward Dennis Rodman was
charged Tuesday with misdemeanor drunken driving stemming from a
December arrest in Costa Mesa, Calif. Police said Rodman had a
blood-alcohol level of .15, nearly twice California's legal limit,
when he was pulled over Dec. 22. His arraignment is scheduled for
April 3.

LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY RACE HEADED FOR RUNOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil
Garcetti appeared Tuesday to be headed toward a Nov. 7 showdown
with veteran prosecutor Steve Cooley, who was running a close
second.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt by the widening LAPD corruption scandal and a surge in
Republicans casting ballots for the officially nonpartisan post,
Garcetti was coming up short of the simple majority he needed to
avoid a runoff against the second-place finisher in the three-man
race.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti, a two-term Democratic incumbent, came under fire
throughout the campaign from Cooley, a top deputy in the District
Attorney's Office, and environmental lawyer Barry Groveman, a
former county and city prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting a runoff, Garcetti refused to participate in campaign
debates before Tuesday's election, shunned TV and radio spots and
reserved nearly all of his campaign treasury to give him an early
boost in an anticipated showdown in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley raised less money than the other candidates and chose to
only broadcast his platform over the radio. But he boasted some
advantages over Groveman going into the contest, including his
decades of experience as a county prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative, Cooley was expected to benefit as Republican
voters turned out to cast ballots in the GOP presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Groveman's showing in the primary was expected to be partly
helped by his campaign as a reform-minded outsider, which included
a recent television commercial that stressed his role in exposing
the Belmont Learning Center scandal. Groveman is a private attorney
from Calabasas.
</P>
<P>
   Following months of the public's seeming apathy toward the race
for the county's top prosecutor, Cooley and Groveman increased
interest in the contest largely by arguing that Garcetti is
partially culpable for the LAPD Rampart corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Garcetti's office has asked the Superior Court
to set aside dozens of convictions that his prosecutors won using
allegedly false testimony by cops, who also have been accused of
planting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political attacks, Garcetti remained hunkered down,
hoping his unwillingness to even acknowledge his opponents would
diminish their credibility. His camp became increasingly resigned
over the past 10 days to the likelihood that he would be forced
into a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Garcetti's future flashed before his eyes when
it took days to determine whether he bested another relative
unknown, John Lynch. While being outmatched financially, Lynch came
within 4,000 votes of winning the 1996 general election. More than
2 million ballots were cast. Lynch benefited greatly from voter
dissatisfaction over Garcetti's handling of the O.J. Simpson murder
trial.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Garcetti raised over $1 million and saved
almost his entire war chest for November. Cooley and Groveman have
spent nearly all the money they raised.

EARLY VOTE REAFFIRMS STATE'S PULL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 and STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush survived a surge of
crossover votes for Arizona Sen. John McCain in California's first
blanket primary Tuesday and carried the popular vote as well as
winning all 162 convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore capped a coast-to-coast sweep by easily
beating former Sen. Bill Bradley in the nation's largest state.
</P>
<P>
   ``A victory in California has made it much sweeter,'' Gore said
to California supporters in a telephone call to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared victory shortly after the polls closed at 8 p.m.
in California, saying he had scored victories ``from sea to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We promised a national campaign and tonight we have a national
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in West Hollywood where he capped a day of campaigning
in California, vowed to fight on for campaign finance reform and
other issues that drove his campaign but said he would return to
Arizona today to decide whether to stay in the race for the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With his trademark thumbs-up gesture, McCain thanked his
supporters, but it was clear he had failed in his attempt to win
enough support among crossover Democrats and independents to pull
off a popular vote win, which was seen as crucial for him to remain
a credible candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud, so proud, that this message has struck a chord in
the hearts of so many Americans of every race, creed and political
persuasion in this vast and diverse country,'' he told supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``America stands for something so much greater than the cynicism
that sometimes affects us.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the loss in California was not only among
Republicans - as he had anticipated - but exit polls showed
veterans and Christian conservatives going for Bush in strong
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For voters, the blanket primary was a chance to have a say in
the race drawing the most interest even if their votes would not be
counted to determine delegates to the parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad that my vote won't help him, because I'd like to
help him,'' said Susan Stewart of Woodland Hills, a Democrat who
voted for McCain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a joke. The people's vote doesn't matter,'' said
Tom Shiebler, another registered Democrat who voted for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was expected all along to win among Republican voters, and
thus snag the 162 delegates in the winner-take-all contest. But
McCain hoped to attract enough votes from independents and
Democrats for a ``moral victory'' in the popular tally.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario might have caused a bitter fight within the
party, and given McCain fodder for his continual claim to be the
only Republican with broad enough appeal to defeat the Democrats in
November. But Bush's convincing win averted that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   To many voters, though, the primaries are nothing more than
popularity contests anyway, said Sheldon Kamieniecki, chairman and
professor of political science at the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are just exercising a preference, and aren't
looking at the delegate count,'' he said. ``I think most people
probably don't know how the delegates are selected. I think most
people think they're voting for the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiebler, a 48-year-old health care manager, said he's leaning
toward Gore in the general election, but prefers McCain to Bush,
and wants a November contest between candidates he likes. He
insists he wasn't trying to cause mischief in the Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   But Carole Frakes of suburban Woodland Hills, a Republican who
voted for McCain on Tuesday, said the open primary lets crossover
voters sabotage the opposing party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people vote not for the candidate they prefer, but
they vote for a certain strategy,'' said Frakes, 56, a laboratory
manager. ``I considered doing that myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Tuesday's election, the campaigns conceded that the
results could well determine the nominees for each party.
</P>
<P>
   For California voters, it was a unique event in that the state -
the nation's most populous and politically influential with 54
electoral votes - finally got a chance to determine the nominees of
their respective parties, even though it came late in a day of
voting across the country.
</P>
<P>
   And with so many states holding elections, the ``Super Tuesday''
campaigns served as a precursor of what can be expected for the
November general election, both in themes and campaign styles.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident as Bush returned to his original theme of being
a ``compassionate conservative'' and both he and Gore reached out
to independent voters needed to decide the election.
</P>
<P>
   California voters also got what they have become accustomed to -
television campaigns waged through commercials. When combined, it
is expected the candidates will have spent in excess of $15 million
over the past three weeks in California alone.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used his final weeks of commercials to begin a broader
approach, while Bush and McCain have battled primarily for
Republican votes.

GORE AND BUSH WIN IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs to clarify that statistics in grafs 1-3 come from
surveys of voters)  
(jt&AMP;lh) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If California's jungle primary was the first
harbinger of the general election, Al Gore Tuesday claimed he was
the king of beasts, with surveys of voters showing he finished
first among contenders listed on the same blanket ballot regardless
of party.
</P>
<P>
   But the surveys showed George W. Bush was a close second, and
the overall news from the polls was more good than great for Gore,
suggesting an advantage, but not a lock, for him in November in the
most-populous state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush each won the support of about 3 in 10 voters in
California, with the surveys showing Gore slightly ahead. Sen. John
McCain drew about 25 percent, and Bill Bradley barely 10 percent,
according to the surveys. Fully 20 percent of McCain's support came
from voters who identified themselves as Democrats, and one-third
from independents, and 40 percent of his supporters said they would
support Gore in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Those were all positive signs for Gore, as were favorable
ratings 10 percentage points higher than those for Bush and a
15-point advantage among the self-described moderates who made up
almost 40 percent of the electorate here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has made scores of visits to the state in the last
seven years, spoke Tuesday night to a ballroom of supporters by
telephone, saying: ``I can't tell you how important it is to me to
win big in the California Democratic contest and to win the overall
California primary contest. That is a harbinger of things to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore ran well behind his fellow Democrat, Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, who drew the support of nearly 6 in 10 voters in her
race against a split field of contenders for the Republican
nomination to challenge her in November, and Gore just edged Bush
in a hypothetical general election match-up, while McCain ran 10
points ahead of Gore. Half of independent voters said they would
back Gore in the fall, but 4 in 10 favored Bush, and like numbers
said that Gore and Bush were both ``about right'' in terms of
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that Bush will be strong enough to be competitive
here and that there's plenty of time for healing to happen,'' said
Steve Kinney, a longtime Republican pollster here. ``It just shows
you that here in California there's not a lot of love for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one top Democratic strategist agreed, saying on
condition of anonymity: ``My sense of this is Gore did OK, but not
as well as he should have. It scares me that he doesn't have more
oomph on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing conclusions from Tuesday's results here posed particular
hazards, because this was California's first presidential primary
using the blanket ballot, and there were no comparable benchmarks.
All votes counted in the overall horserace, but under major party
rules, only the votes of party members counted toward delegate
selection, a fact that voters themselves seem not to have fully
grasped. Two-thirds of those surveyed said they would consider the
candidate who won the most total votes to be the ``real winner'' of
his party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gore won overwhelmingly among Democrats, taking 6 in 10
Democratic votes to just under 2 in 10 for Bradley, and Bush took
just under 6 in 10 Republicans to fewer than 4 in 10 for McCain,
political professionals in both parties quickly turned their
attention to handicapping the general election, and especially
trying to discern where McCain supporters might go.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters, McCain drew his strongest support from
moderates, those with post-college education, those over 45 years
old, those earning over $100,000 a year, veterans and those who
decided to vote in the last week, a demographic slice much like
those that were crucial to the victories of California's last
Republican governor, Pete Wilson. When those voters were asked who
they would support this fall, Bush ran evenly with Gore among
veterans and those over 45, came close with those earning over
$100,000 and lost the others by margins of roughly 60-to-40.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush loses those people in the fall, he won't even be
competitive in California,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic
consultant. ``That's a group he has to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, McCain was most competitive in the Central
Valley, the vast agricultural swath that runs the interior spine of
the state, which accounted for a quarter of Tuesday's electorate
and often decides statewide elections. Tuesday, McCain, Gore and
Bush each took about 3 in 10 votes there; in the hypothetical fall
contest, Gore and Bush split the area evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers have long contended that he could translate his
appeal in Texas, a fast-growing southwestern state with a booming
high-tech economy, to California, which national Republicans have
not contested vigorously since Bush's father won in 1988. Bush has
also shown strength with Hispanic voters, who make up a growing
part of the electorate but have trended strongly to the Democratic
column in recent years, mostly in a backlash against Wilson's
strong campaigns against affirmative action and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters accounted for about 10 percent of Tuesday's
electorate, and Gore won the votes of 6 in 10, with Bush and McCain
together taking about 3 in 10. In a hypothetical fall match-up,
Bush, who ran television advertisements in Spanish here, drew a
respectable 3 in 10 Hispanic voters, well above recent Republican
statewide showings, compared to two-thirds for Gore. In his victory
speech in Texas Tuesday night, Bush declared: ``Legal immigration
is not a source of national weakness; it is a sign of national
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 6 in 10 Hispanic voters, roughly the same percentage
as the electorate as a whole, supported a successful ballot
initiative to limit marriage to heterosexual couples, which
Democrats opposed by a like margin.
</P>
<P>
   Republican analysts called that a sign of Bush's potential
appeal on an issue of traditional family values.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Ross, a Democratic consultant in Sacramento who has
made a specialty of working with Hispanic candidates, said Bush's
opposition to gun control and abortion rights remained sharply at
odds with Californians' strong support for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what'll happen is Bush will compete in California for
about three weeks, and then we're going to keep talking about guns
and abortion, and he'll leave,'' Ross said. ``Three weeks ago, in
one of the most conservative assembly districts in the state, in
the Central Valley, I asked the following question: ``Do you favor
or oppose the government requiring mandatory registration of all
guns,'' and 73 percent said they favored it.''

CALIFORNIA   VOTERS OK MARRIAGE MEASURE, APPROVE INDIAN GAMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Updating throughout) 
 
 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Proposition 22, the controversial measure
affirming that only marriages between a man and a woman are
recognized as legal in California, won clear-cut passage Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 1A, the Indian gaming measure, also won passage
along with four public works bond issues and an initiative that
toughens penalties for juveniles who commit serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 25, the campaign finance reform measure, was
defeated, as were two measures easing restrictions on ``bad faith''
lawsuits against insurers, The Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 26, a measure reducing the majority needed to pass
school bonds from two-thirds to one-half of votes cast plus one
vote, was leading narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by Voter News Service for The Associated
Press and TV networks showed Proposition 22 got strong support from
men and women and from voters of all races and income groups.
Democrats opposed it by 2-1 but Republicans backed it by about 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Republican state Sen. W.J. ``Pete'' Knight of Palmdale, who
authored Proposition 22, said he was delighted by the affirmation
that state law defines marriage only as the union between a man and
a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy the people of the state of California decided they
didn't want to change the definition of marriage as the union
between a man and a woman, which has worked for civilization for
thousands of years and has been shown to be the best unit in which
to raise kids,'' said Knight, who is the father of a gay son.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Proposition 22, the ``No-on-22'' campaign, said
they were disappointed, but were encouraged that the debate over
homosexual rights had been elevated by the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a step forward,'' said spokeswoman Tracey Conaty. ``It
changed the debate from if gays and lesbians and their families
should have the same basic rights as heterosexual couples to how
they should be afforded those rights and responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the state ballot measure was intended as a
simple, 14-word formula for the protection and affirmation of the
institution of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intention to hurt anyone, no intention to be
divisive, no hidden agenda,'' said Knight, saying his relationship
with his son remains a private family matter and that the only
emotion he felt was joy over the measure's passage.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, however, kindled complex reactions among those who
viewed it as a symbolic, and therefore hurtful, affront to
homosexuals. It quickly became the year's flash point among the 20
propositions, overshadowing a series of fiscal measures.
</P>
<P>
   No other state recognizes same-sex marriages, but 30 other
states have passed laws much like Proposition 22 as a defensive
move after a case involving same-sex marriage reached Hawaii's
Supreme Court in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   All states currently recognize only marriage between a man and a
woman. California's law, however, requires the state to recognize
legally performed marriages in other states, including common-law
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In other issues, voters indicated they were prepared to crack
down harder on juvenile crime, with the passage of Proposition 21.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed overhaul of the juvenile justice system, sponsored
by former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, would give prosecutors,
rather than juvenile court judges, the power to decide whether
teens age 14 to 17 would be tried as adults for serious crimes, and
would limit judges' discretion in sending youths for treatment
rather than to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five propositions with the biggest impact on
Californian taxpayers _ Propositions 12, 13, 14 and 16, authorizing
about $4.46 billion in new bonds for water, park, library and other
projects _ won. Only Proposition 15, which would provide $220
million for new crime labs, was lagging.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a series of school scandals in the Los Angeles
Unified School District, Proposition 26 _ the measure that would
reduce from two-thirds to a simple majority the votes needed for
local school bonds _ was leading by a small margin.
</P>
<P>
   The state's latest campaign finance measure _ which included
limits on who can contribute to campaigns, and how much _ failed.
Proposition 25 would have banned corporate campaign contributions,
and provided partial public financing.
</P>
<P>
   Voters turned down Proposition 28, an effort to rescind a
50-cents-a-pack cigarette tax passed in 1998. Ned Roscoe of the
Cigarettes Cheaper! discount chain had challenged the tax sponsored
by film director Rob Reiner. The tax had been estimated to generate
some $650 million a year in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running debate over Indian gaming in the state took a
big step toward resolution, with the passage of Proposition 1A,
which would expand tribal gambling.

 FOR BENJAMIN KAPLAN, TUITION MONEY IS A MATTER OF DIGGING  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Six years ago, Benjamin Kaplan was a high
school junior in Eugene, Ore., with a nice resume (student body
president, tennis jock) and a decent shot at getting into an elite
college like Harvard. He got into Harvard, all right, graduating
last year with honors in economics. But what Harvard taught Kaplan
about finances paled beside what Kaplan taught himself about
financing his education.
</P>
<P>
   It began that junior year, in 1994, Kaplan says, with a
scholarship competition sponsored by Discover Card. Applying on a
whim, he was surprised to win $2,500. A few weeks later, Kaplan
learned he had won another $15,000 in Discovery Card's nationwide
contest. Bingo.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, big lights went off,'' Kaplan, 22, recalls
during an interview in the Charles Hotel, part of a self-arranged
book tour that brought him back east from his home in Oregon.
``What else was out there? I thought you had to be a Michael
Jordan-type athlete or to have cured cancer in high school to win
these things. So I did more research.''
</P>
<P>
   Scouring bookstores, libraries, and guidance office shelves
(this was the pre-Internet era), Kaplan came up with three dozen
competitions worth entering. Two dozen of these eventually paid off
for him, providing a total of $90,000 in tuition money _ and the
basis for a new book titled ``How to Go to College Almost for
Free'' (Waggle Dancer Books), which is getting positive reviews for
its practical approach to digging for scholarship gold.
</P>
<P>
   One commentator on amazon .com's Web site says the competition
among how-to books ``wasn't even close,'' with Kaplan's easily the
most useful. Another Internet reviewer says, ``You can tell the
author has experienced firsthand everything he writes about.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, who rejected signing with an established publisher in
favor of launching his own publishing venture, concedes that other
good guidebooks are out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My book is more about the key strategies in winning these
competitions, not where to find them,'' says Kaplan, an intense,
engaging young man who does not noticeably suffer from false
modesty. ``It's about separating out the people who are successful
at doing this from those who aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The softcover book is divided into 12 chapters, bearing such
titles as ``Painting Your Own Portrait'' and ``Acing the
Interview.'' It includes a directory of scholarships and state
agencies, plus samples of winning entries. While crammed with
specifics, from grooming personal essay themes to tapping database
search engines, the book stresses one unassailably simple piece of
advice: Sow and ye shall reap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common denominator among scholarship winners comes down to
one thing. They apply; others don't,'' says Kaplan. ``It's not like
buying a lottery ticket, because what I did in some cases to win
money was a lot of hard work. But if you're willing to put in the
work, you will win scholarship money. There are hundreds of
millions of dollars out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan says it's a myth that only certain types of students win
these contests, or that mediocre grades or lack of an unusual
talent make it futile to apply for, say, the Ayn Rand Essay Contest
(top prize: $10,000) or Tylenol Scholarship (also $10,000). In one
case, Kaplan lost out to an applicant who was in jail at the time.
The winning essay _ touching on drugs, gangs, and the value of
freedom _ is reprinted in Kaplan's book as an example of
perseverance in the face of daunting odds.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Kaplan met a student who wanted to be an
airline pilot and who'd heard about a scholarship specifically
offered to aspiring pilots. ``This guy thought he had no chance, so
he decided not to enter,'' says Kaplan. ``Later, he found out that
since no one had bothered to apply that year, the money went to the
person who'd won the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of a self-selection process that goes on
here,'' he continues. ``What you want to be saying is, `I'm a good
investment of your educational dollars because I'm going to work
hard. Or, I'm going to give something back to society. Or, I have
this latent potential that I've never developed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Researching obscure sources is seldom wasted effort either,
Kaplan contends. ``The harder you have to dig,'' he says, ``the
higher the chances that others won't.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kaplan's experience is any guide, playing the scholarship
game can be life-transforming. An only child, he grew up in a
middle-class family that valued education but faced challenges
about how to pay for it, he says. At 13, Kaplan was a nationally
ranked tennis star who dreamed of playing Wimbledon someday.
Sidelined by a back injury, however, he was forced to channel his
energies elsewhere, in one case setting up a homework help-line at
his high school.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his senior year, Kaplan and his family were busy
reaping the rewards _ financial and otherwise _ of his
extraordinary scholarship bounty. They were flown all over the
country to attend award ceremonies, and Kaplan was interviewed
wherever he went. He was even featured in a short documentary film
produced by Discover Card. The once-shy teenager shed his fear of
public speaking, he says, and the more exposure he got, the more
emboldened he became.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Washington, D.C., Kaplan decided on the spur of the
moment to call on Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield. Hatfield
immediately offered Kaplan a summer internship, which he accepted.
Needless to say, none of this hurt Kaplan's chances of getting into
Harvard, where he went on to write for The Harvard Crimson and to
co-write the 1999 Hasty Pudding Theatricals musical, a political
spoof titled ``I Get No Kick From Campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' says Kaplan, ``one legacy of this whole process was
learning the kinds of skills that can help, whether you're applying
to college or going out on job interviews. It also forced me to
evaluate my own strengths and weaknesses, like a love of writing
that I'd never really focused on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another valuable legacy is that Kaplan managed to graduate from
college debt-free. Because of this, he says, he was able to finance
the launch of his own company, which his parents are helping to
bankroll. As conceived by Kaplan, the company, Waggle Dancer Books
(www .waggledancer.com), will become a multimedia purveyor of
materials themed to ``life milestones'' such as community service
and job searches. He has also started a related Web site
(www.winscholarships .com), where he's known as the ``Scholarship
Coach.'' What Dr. Ruth does for the human libido, Kaplan aims to do
for the tuition subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   He's also working on a screenplay _ and yes, he's prepared to
cold-call Hollywood studio execs if he has to.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned from doing the book is to go for it, seize the
initiative,'' says Kaplan. ``All the best things I've done are
things I've done for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   --Use Internet search engines to check other high school and
college guidance offices for scholarship listings.
</P>
<P>
   --Create reusable application materials. Recycle past essays on
perennial themes.
</P>
<P>
   --Use school writing assignments to flesh out application
essays. Old homework papers may contain hidden treasures.
</P>
<P>
   --Find past contest winners in your community and talk to them
about how they did it.
</P>
<P>
   --Pay attention to lead times, especially for competitions
requiring long-term strategies. Approach the process as an
extracurricular activity that can pay big dividends.

BRUINS' LEADERSHIP PASSES TO MCLAREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There was no formal ceremony to mark the passing of the
torch from Ray Bourque to Kyle McLaren, the new minister of defense
for the Bruins. There was a two-minute phone conversation Monday
night between Bourque and McLaren, not long after Bourque had been
dealt to the Colorado Avalanche to pursue his Stanley Cup dreams.
</P>
<P>
   That will have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he told me, `Remember what I taught you over the
last couple of years,' '' said McLaren. ``He believes in me. He's
one guy who really believes in what I can do. I know I have a fan
in him that will watch me through the years. To have the respect of
Ray Bourque and what he taught me, I'm never going to forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first game ever was in the Boston Garden. I started in that
game, the last game ever there. Those memories will last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Tuesday was warm and springlike outside, it was cold and
gloomy inside the Ristuccia rink on the first day of the
post-Bourque era. One fan expressed the darkness in his soul
planting a sign at the entrance to the rink that said, ``Jeremy
Jacobs and Harry Sinden: You suck!'' It was quickly taken down.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange day in Bruins history. The most recognizable
figure on the ice was the coach, Pat Burns. There was no presence,
no centerpiece. It was as if the Eiffel Tower had been removed from
Paris, Big Ben ripped out of London.
</P>
<P>
   What remained was, well, the future _ which had swiftly, perhaps
too swiftly, turned into the present.
</P>
<P>
   Will the spotlight fall on McLaren now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's my team,'' he said. ``The younger guys are
definitely now in the forefront. We still have guys around that
have done a great job over the years like Rob DiMaio and Don
Sweeney and Steve Heinze. Those are the veteran guys right now. The
young guys are now having to wise up and mature a little sooner
than expected because we didn't expect Ray to leave this early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not seeing him is strange. It's tough for everyone. Twenty-one
years he's been here. When he's around, he's brightened up so many
guys' lives. Some guys are still shocked it happened. I'm sure it's
not going to settle in for a while, but it has to settle in because
we have to play hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   In five years, the 23-year-old McLaren has not yet reached
All-Star level. He has soaked in the wisdom of Bourque, but the
other part, the biggest part, must come from McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at his points and you can look at his production,
but what he did off the ice is what impressed me,'' said McLaren.
``Family came first to him. No matter what. This is the only time
where I see him going for something and maybe moving away from his
family for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Now McLaren will be expected to handle himself on and off the
ice with the same class, even though he is no Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be pressure there for someone to come
in and fill his shoes,'' said McLaren. ``If people are expecting me
to do it, give them 80-90 points a year, I'd only be kidding myself
to put that kind of pressure on myself. I just have to play the
best I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to be the captain of the team or the main
focal point because there are a lot of guys in here who can do the
job, too. Ray was an All-Star here and he'll be that wherever he
goes. You can't just build a team around one guy; it has to be
around a bunch of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   As amazing as it seems, McLaren is third on the team in
seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's strange,'' he said. ``Ray's gone and we can't cry about
it. We're certainly sad to see him go, but we have a lot of guys
with five or less years in the league. We need those guys to pick
it up and play stronger. We have to worry about winning those
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the need to move on, McLaren thinks some things are
sacred. One of them is the ``C'' that Bourque wore for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very surprised if there was a captain for a while,''
said McLaren. ``One of the most respected captains in our league
just left our team. I think it's out of respect that nobody should
wear it, nobody should sit in his stalls here or the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should wear the `C' today and really I don't think
anyone should wear it for the rest of the season and maybe next
year.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: There's nothing hard about
hardware, done right
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I don't know what I'd do without an
old-fashioned hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what I would have done just last week, after a hose
burst that I had connected to my swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's fault but mine.
</P>
<P>
   I had bought a device that's supposed to maintain the pool's
water level.
</P>
<P>
   When the water falls below a certain level, the device
automatically turns itself on.
</P>
<P>
   When the water returns to the proper level, the device
automatically turns itself off.
</P>
<P>
   That way the pump won't burn itself up when the water runs low,
like it did last year.
</P>
<P>
   That way I won't have to pay $250 to $300 for a new pump, like I
did last year.
</P>
<P>
   This device, which I hooked up to a garden hose, was to solve my
problem. The only problem was, I hooked it up to a garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   The water pressure is constant. A garden hose can stand water
pressure for just so long. At some point, it will burst.
</P>
<P>
   At some point after that, your neighbor's yard will begin to
look like a swimming pool itself.
</P>
<P>
   I had tried two different hoses, each your garden-variety of
garden hose. Different hoses, same results _ instant rice paddies.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I took my problem to the people at the hardware
store. I've been taking them my problems, and they've been taking
care of me, for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   It's operated by the same family that owned the store when I was
growing up. The fellow whose name is on the sign out front learned
the business working for his father. Now his sons work for him.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind if you need just a dime's worth of nails. You get
personal service.
</P>
<P>
   What I needed, I told them, was an industrial-strength garden
hose that would hold up under constant pressure.
</P>
<P>
   What they told me was that there was no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later,'' said the fellow whose name is on the sign
out front, ``it'll burst. If I told you different, I'd be telling
you wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But before I could ask ``What can I do?'' he was telling his
son, whose name is also on the sign out front, ``Here's what we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   What they did was take a length of PVC-type pipe _ an
extra-flexible variety _ and used clamps to attach garden hose-type
connections at either end.
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile, a little longer than normal, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   I had first told them that I needed 10 feet, but then on seeing
10 feet of it _ this after it had been cut from the roll _ I saw
I'd made a mistake, that I'd need more like 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to pay them for the hose they'd already cut. They
wouldn't hear of it. They said they'd just save it back. Sooner or
later somebody would come along needing 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Total bill _ for pipe, clamps, connections, labor _ was about
$15. Problem solved.
</P>
<P>
   I say all of that to say simply this:
</P>
<P>
   Warehouse discount centers, with acres and acres of everything
you could ever think of, will never be able to give the kind of
personal service you find in an old-fashioned hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what I'd do without an old-fashioned hardware
store.
</P>
<P>
   I hope the day never comes when I find out.

   PRESIDENTIAL-CAMPAIGN (Undated) _ After five frenetic weeks, the
presidential campaign looks just the way the pundits, the pollsters
and the party establishment scripted it a year ago. Despite the
promise of a cliffhanger, the favored candidates, Vice President Al
Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, relied on their money,
connections and political machines to survive unexpectedly strong
assaults from the insurgents, Democrat Bill Bradley and Republican
John McCain. By ROBERTY SALLADAY and LANCE WILLIAMS.

   US-HOUSE (San Francisco) _ Voters in California's open primary
on Tuesday gave Democrats reason to believe they will take back
control of the U.S. House of Representatives this fall. By CHUCK
FINNIE.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-REFORM (San Francisco) _ Campaign finance reform may be
the hot topic of national political debates. But Tuesday,
California voters made it clear that they're not willing to accept
just any reform. Proposition 25, a complicated measure that would
have devoted up to $55 million in state money to providing public
financing for candidates, went down to an emphatic defeat,
garnering only 35 percent of the vote. By ERIN McCORMICK.

<P>
   MANAGEMENT-LESSONS (San Francisco) _ Often bosses get so caught
up in the day-to-day frenzy that they don't stop to think about how
they are performing a lot of mundane tasks that ought to be
delegated. If you delegate, certainly your subordinates might not
handle tasks as well as you would. But you can teach them how to do
better, and then have time to concentrate on the important parts of
your job. By DAVE MURPHY.

   OUTDOORS (San Francisco) _ Can you imagine making $100,000 in a
month while working in the great outdoors in Alaska? That is the
fantasy that drives being a commercial crabber on the Bering Sea,
where you experience the marrow of life of the great outdoors while
getting a stake in the last great Alaskan gold rush _ king crab.
Well, it doesn't always turn out that way, says former Alaskan
crabber Spike Walker. By TOM STIENSTRA.

</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Undated) _ Many unsuspecting travelers have
become pawns in an ongoing feud between travel agents and one of
the world's fastest-growing cruise lines _ a relationship so soured
that most agents seem unmoved by a $1 million show of respect for
their embattled profession. It's a saga that transcends cruising
and sheds insight into the changing environment in which we plan
our travels. By HARRY SHATTUCK.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-SKI-DEALS (Undated) _ It's not too late to play in the
snow. Spring calendars at U.S. ski resorts are dotted with
fun-filled events. The cost is right, too. Ski resorts may
represent the only vacation destinations that lower prices when the
weather becomes more agreeable. So late season is low season with
price breaks on lodging and lift tickets. By SYD KEARNEY.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ In San Francisco, no person is an
island, not even a member of that smallest of local identity
groups, persons of Republicanism. My conspiracy to undo George Bush

 &HT;    Braves lose Smoltz for season
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Atlanta Braves pitcher John Smoltz's fragile
right elbow has given in. The right-handed Cy Young Award-winner
will undergo ligament transplant surgery on the elbow March 23 and
will be lost for the season, the Braves announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Though he could not pinpoint when the ligament was torn, Smoltz
experienced uncustomary pain for five hours after his first spring
outing last Sunday. Though the discomfort subsided the next day, a
precautionary MRI taken Tuesday revealed the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually more positive than I thought because after not
knowing what's going on, I know what I can do now in the next
three, four years with this one process,'' said Smoltz, who is 32
and has twice undergone arthroscopies on the same elbow for bone
spur and bone chip removal.
</P>
<P>
   The operation will be performed by a Birmingham specialist, Dr.
James Andrews, who did the same operation with reliever Kerry
Ligtenberg last year. The usual recovery period is 12 to 18 months.
Management was uncertain on Smoltz's replacement, though
left-hander Terry Mulholland and Bruce Chen, in competition for the
fifth starter's spot, now have two openings to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'll do is examine who we have here,'' general manager
John Schuerholz said. ``See how comfortable we feel with how we
make things work in John's absence and then decide whether or not
we look outside the organization.''

 &HT;    Last chance for pruning; get head start on mower
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Trees and shrubs that shed their leaves last fall
are on the verge of greening up again, so if you have any pruning
to do, you'd better do it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good time to get a head start on the grass cutting
season by getting your lawn mower ready.
</P>
<P>
   PRUNING PROTOCOL
</P>
<P>
   Pete Kossoudji, president of North Dayton Garden Center, said he
prefers to prune most trees and shrubs in November and December,
early in their yearly dormant period. But he said now is still a
good time to get rid of dead wood and troublesome branches.
</P>
<P>
   You should prune, though, before your woody plants start
sprouting new leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Kossoudji said the first step in pruning is preparing your
tools. Hand pruners are best for twigs up to about a quarter-inch.
Heavier lopping shears will handle medium branches, and a saw might
be needed for limbs an inch thick or more.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the pruning tools are sharp and in good working order.
Pruning cuts should be as smooth and even as possible; jagged cuts
can promote disease.
</P>
<P>
   Kossoudji said pruning tools also should be cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dip them in chlorine bleach to be sure there's no fungus or
anything on the blades,'' he said. ``You don't want to transfer an
infection from one tree to another.''
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't experienced with the characteristics of each of
the plant species on your property, you might want to visit an
arborist, a nursery or your county extension agent for tips on
care. If you don't know the name of the plant, a photograph and
clipping may help the expert pinpoint what you need.
</P>
<P>
   Start pruning by removing branches that are dead, dying,
diseased or defective.
</P>
<P>
   A common defect that should be corrected at this time of year is
the ``crossing'' or ``rubbing'' branch. A crossing branch is one
that is growing in such a way that its bark touches another branch
or the tree trunk. Failure to remove such branches can lead to
problems later.
</P>
<P>
   Prune branches by making a cut at the base of the branch, but
leave the branch collar intact. The collar is the rounded extension
at the point where the branch meets the trunk or its parent branch.
</P>
<P>
   Larger trees and trees approaching utility lines are often best
left to professionals. But if you think you can tackle a heavy
branch on a mature tree, use the three-cut method.
</P>
<P>
   Saw a notch on the underside of the branch a few inches out from
the collar. Then move the saw to the top of the branch a few inches
farther out and saw until the branch breaks. Finally, saw off the
stump of the branch at the collar.
</P>
<P>
   This method keeps the falling branch from tearing away bark on
the parent branch as it breaks free.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to seal the wound left when you cut a branch at
this time of year. In fact, sealing the wound can create an
incubator for infection and do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Trim young shrubs to create a thicker, bushier appearance. In
most cases, you'll be removing one-fourth to one-third of the
branches at their bases. Remove the oldest, longest branches
</P>
<P>
   Another method effective with some plants is to remove the ends
of branches to encourage stems already sprouting along the sides to
grow. Again, check with an expert to make sure this technique is
right for your plant.
</P>
<P>
   Young trees that will be large at maturity must be trained while
they are young; their growth must be controlled and directed so
they have a sturdy, tapered trunk and well-spaced branches no more
than half the diameter of the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Prune by selectively removing branches at their bases. Never try
to round or otherwise shape a tree by cutting off the ends of
branches. The shaping effect will be short-lived, and you'll ruin
the health of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing to consider while pruning is what you'll do with
all the twigs and branches you're removing.
</P>
<P>
   If you have access to a shredder, the solution is simple. Grind
up the sticks and save the resulting chips to use as mulch.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a group of neighbors might agree to do their pruning and
lawn clean-up at around the same time so that you could split the
cost of renting a shredder for a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Most trash-collection services have rules about yard waste. They
may not accept twigs and branches stuffed into bags and cans with
the rest of your trash.
</P>
<P>
   Check with the agency that collects your trash. You might have
to bundle your yard waste and pay an extra fee for its collection.
</P>
<P>
   LAWN MOWER MAINTENANCE
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't give your lawn mower a good cleaning before
putting it away for the season last fall, do it now. Start by
cleaning the mower's outside and handles with the same kind of mild
detergent you use to wash a car.
</P>
<P>
   Before cleaning inside the blade housing, remove the spark plug
to prevent accidental starting. Also, check your owner's manual for
restrictions on tipping the mower. Some engines can be damaged by
tipping.
</P>
<P>
   Use a paint scraper to clear any clipping residue stuck inside
the mower housing. Then scrape the inside of the housing with a
wire brush.
</P>
<P>
   While cleaning, examine and tighten all the screws and bolts and
make sure all the switches, levers, pulleys and other control
devices are moving properly.
</P>
<P>
   Before you use your lawn mower, sharpen the blade, change the
oil, replace the spark plug, clean or replace the air filter and do
other maintenance tasks the owner's manual suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Shops that sell and repair lawn equipment usually charge a few
dollars to sharpen and balance a blade. You can use a rotary
grinding tool to sharpen a blade yourself, but it's sometimes hard
to keep the weight of the blade balanced after grinding.
</P>
<P>
   Your owner's manual will tell you what kind of replacement oil
you need to put in the mower. Lawn mowers take special spark plugs
that are sold wherever lawn equipment is sold or repaired, and the
plugs are standardized for most models.
</P>
<P>
   When the mower is tuned up and ready for use, add a bit of
gasoline and start it up.
</P>
<P>
   If it starts quickly and runs strongly, you know you'll be ready
to go when it time to mow the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   If the mower acts up, you'll be able to get it into a repair
shop before the spring rush.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take a couple hours or days to get a lawn mower
repaired now, but in April or May it can take weeks to get a mower
serviced.

 &HT;    Ethnic ingredients allow you to go global with your cooking
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Exotic ingredients for ethnic cooking have gone
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the bottle of fish sauce now found on most supermarket
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Fish sauce, as the name implies, is made from fermented fish. It
is a smelly sauce. Trying it has been likened to encountering
Camembert for the first time. But it is as essential to Vietnamese
and Thai cookery as soy sauce is to Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, adventuresome cooks had to seek out an Asian
grocery store to find fish sauce. But today's cooks have developed
an appetite for exotic cuisines and want to prepare authentic
versions at home.
</P>
<P>
   Make that today's busy cooks, who have no patience for driving
to ethnic stores looking for ingredients to cook Pad Thai.
</P>
<P>
   They want to buy the essential rice noodles and fish sauce at
the same place they buy their Tide and Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Grocers have responded by providing an ever-widening array of
specialty ingredients, often clustering them in a single aisle.
</P>
<P>
   To check what's available, I visited six area markets: Cub,
Chmiel's, Dorothy Lane Market, Kroger, Lofino's and Meijer. Some
stores offer only token staples. Others have expanded the selection
to include fresh produce.
</P>
<P>
   These days, ingredients such as cilantro and tomatillos, bok
choy and wonton wrappers, balsamic vinegar and radicchio are so
common shoppers take them for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Sushi rice, roasted seaweed and yes, fish sauce, also were
widely available. Some items were unique to one store. I found jars
of Indian garam masala among a Spice Hunter line at Cub Foods. Even
precooked, ready-to-eat Japanese edamame _ the soybean snack _ were
in the produce aisle at one Kroger store.
</P>
<P>
   There are notable differences between supermarket ingredients
and those found in ethnic groceries. Supermarkets favor
Americanized brands with high-style labels and user-friendly names
such as House of Thai or Thai Kitchen. And they target
English-speaking customers, unlike imported brands that may have no
instructions and often do not include a word of English. And the
supermarket brands are generally packaged in smaller quantities
suitable for cooks who don't use these ingredients every day.
</P>
<P>
   But going to the supermarket with a shopping list of ethnic
ingredients can be a crap shoot. To maximize your chances of
finding what you want, try a Meijer store; Second choice is Kroger.
</P>
<P>
   But not all stores in any chain offer the same ingredients.
Newer Kroger stores offer considerably more ethnic staples. But if
one store in a chain has an ingredient, the store where you shop
should be able to order it. Just ask.
</P>
<P>
   The Meijer in Kettering wins extra points for offering a
``Shopper's Guide to Fresh Produce,'' which provides descriptions
and suggestions for buying, storing and using everything from
plantains to blood oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Because these items are not everyday staples, pricing varies
widely. A bunch of cilantro may be priced as low as 69 cents and as
high as $1.99. Blood oranges may be as low as eight for $2 or as
high as two for $1. Fresh ginger may be as little as $1.69 a pound
or as high as $2.99. Baby bananas and red bananas range from 69
cents a pound to $1.49. If prices matter, remember that they are
invariably lower at ethnic groceries where the items are not sold
as specialty ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   TOP ETHNIC FOODS
</P>
<P>
   _ Blood oranges: This unfortunately named citrus fruit hails
from Italy and Spain, but is now grown in California. The rind is
splotched with burgundy color, and inside the edible fruit is the
color of red raspberries. In Sicily, a pitcher of the juice of the
blood orange is a breakfast staple. I found them found them at
Kroger, Lofino's and Meijer. To sample the sweet fruit, which is
less acidic than more familiar oranges, add sections to a spinach
salad with a raspberry dressing and toasted pine nuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pancetta: When a recipe calls for this Italian cured,
generally unsmoked bacon, it usually requires a trip to a specialty
store. Ditto prosciutto. But I stumbled over slices of packaged
pancetta among the cheeses at a Chmiel's store in Washington Twp.
Pancetta is used in cooking and in the foundation of sauces and
soup. Bits can be browned and sprinkled over vegetables or used in
a variation of spinach salad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mangos: These call up sunny Caribbean images, and they are at
virtually all supermarkets. Meijer carries two kinds, the
traditional and another labeled ataulfo, which tasters found ``more
tropical'' and ``exotic.'' The fruit tenaciously clings to the
seed, and the best approach is to put a knife off center and slice
down the fat side, keeping the knife to the side of the pit. Take
each slice and score the fruit with a knife, cutting down to the
skin. Use your thumbs to invert the slice, pushing the flesh up.
Cut off the cubes. An easy way to enjoy mango is in a salsa with
some hot peppers and maybe cilantro. It's a wonderful accompaniment
to pork and chicken.
</P>
<P>
   _ Curry paste: Call this an Asian convenience food. You can make
your own curry paste. You could even make your own curry powder,
but few here do that, and there's good reason that cans of curry
paste are sold in ethnic markets, too. Those markets carry a wider
variety, but supermarkets usually stock red or green and
occasionally other blends. You usually only need a small amount in
any recipe, but once the jar or can is opened, the curry will keep
in the refrigerator for two months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chipotle chiles: These smoked jalapenos are the hot ingredient
of the new century. It's hard to open a magazine, whether it be
Better Homes &AMP; Gardens or Gourmet without finding a recipe calling
for chipotles. Though dried chipotle chiles are available, the
preferred ingredient is canned chipotles packed in adobo sauce.
Often some of the sauce is added, along with the chiles. Pay
attention to the labels. It's easy to pick up the pureed and more
mild canned chipotle sauce instead of the chipotles in adobo sauce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Poblano chiles: Twenty five years ago, when Mexican cooking
guru Diana Kennedy wrote her first cookbook, she couldn't find
these peppers even in New York City. Now the black/green poblano
chiles and an array of others such as the fiery habanera and
serrano chiles are virtually everywhere. Poblano chiles are the
right ones for making chiles rellenos. First they need to be
roasted and peeled; then they're stuffed with cheese or ground meat
filling, lightly battered and fried. Strips of poblanos are used in
vegetable dishes and soups as well.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH:
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Suppose obesity were an infectious disease, Lloyd
Laubach says. Imagine how many billions of dollars the government
would be spending to wipe out a health hazard that costs more than
$100 billion a year in medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people doing a lot of research in this field who
don't think we'll be able to turn this thing around,'' says
Laubach, who chairs the health and sport science department at the
University of Dayton. ``It's truly, truly scary. The numbers just
keep growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of American adults are overweight, as defined by a body
mass index of 25 or more, says Shape Up America!, an organization
dedicated to bringing down that figure. The 18 percent classified
in 1998 as obese, their BMIs at least 30, represented a 50 percent
increase in just seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``About one child in five weighs too much,'' Dr. Dennis Bier of
the Baylor College of Medicine told a national conference on
childhood obesity at Georgetown University last month. And
three-quarters of obese teen-agers will remain obese through
adulthood, says Mary Ellen Huelsman, the registered dietitian who
runs The Children's Medical Center's Body Shop class for weight
control and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity makes people more vulnerable to heart disease, cancer,
arthritis, asthma, sleep apnea and adult-onset diabetes. High blood
pressure is showing up in children as young as 2, the American
Heart Association reported last week. ``In terms of cancer
prevention, a healthy diet and exercise are as important as not
smoking,'' says Dr. Dennis Savaiano, chairman of the Food and
Nutrition Science Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's something we need to address early on,'' Huelsman
says. ``I'm talking about the kindergarten level. Healthy eating
habits need to be formed then.''
</P>
<P>
   First grade isn't too late, though, and neither is high school.
Schools could teach kids ways to enjoy physical activity for a
lifetime, Laubach and Huelsman agree. They just don't make it a
priority. Nor do parents help kids learn how the quick meals of
today's family lifestyles can also be healthy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer is to move more and eat less, or at least eat
fewer calories. But that of course is no more helpful than saying
anyone can get rich in the stock market if they only would buy low
and sell high.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pratt always has known exercise and good nutrition were
good for her. The UD sophomore has decided several times to start
getting in shape. ``I'd be good at it for two or three weeks, and
then I'd quit,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now 19, she credits a UD conditioning class for helping break
that pattern. She learned getting in shape doesn't have to feel
like a punishment. It's OK to work out in 20-minute spurts instead
of an hour at a time. It's OK to lift weights three days a week,
run three days a week, then eat and do whatever she feels like on
the seventh day.
</P>
<P>
   To her amazement, she learned working out can be something she
looks forward to _ a better study break even than a snack and TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize that not only is it good for your body, but
it's good for your overall mental, physical and emotional health,''
Pratt says. ``It makes you feel better. It raises your
self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   She has more energy. Even studying isn't the drag it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   She feels better about her appearance. She's no longer hesitant
to join friends in a basketball game or something else that's
physical.
</P>
<P>
   She's more alert. She doesn't need as much sleep, and she wakes
up more refreshed from the sleep she gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised at how much easier it is to motivate myself to
go out there and work out,'' she says. Even if the day isn't going
so well, ``I have exercise to fall back on. It's something I know
is going to make me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose Pratt and millions of other teen-agers would learn that
at younger ages, Laubach suggests. His biggest beef is that nearly
every state has scratched physical education from its daily school
curriculum. ``A major problem,'' he calls it. Besides that, some
high schools and junior highs have done away with intramural sports
to free up field and gymnasium time for the varsity teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do that stuff and they forget to educate the masses,''
Laubach says. He says George DeMarco of his department is working
on a program to offer local schools called ACES, for ``All Children
Exercising Simultaneously.'' The idea is for several schools to
commit to two times a day when all their students will exercise for
10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise is no more optional than clean air, pure water and
nutritious food, says biologist Frank Booth of the University of
Missouri. Attributing 250,000 deaths a year to inactivity, Booth
has organized Scientists Against Inactivity-Related Diseases as an
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Even when schools have phys-ed classes, Huelsman says, ``They
don't really teach kids physical fitness that they can use for a
lifetime.'' They teach soccer, basketball and softball, phys-ed
advocates complained at the Georgetown obesity conference, with
some occasional lap running for punishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools should be teaching swimming, tennis, aerobics, weight
lifting, walking even,'' Huelsman says. UD offers that kind of
class. Self-defense and dancing classes don't even require special
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to call it movement rather than exercise,'' Huelsman
says. ``So many people think you need to do an hour workout for it
to be beneficial. Take a walk around the neighborhood with your
family, 10 or 15 minutes. Walk the dog. Mow the lawn. Rake the
leaves. Use the stairs instead of the elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   Have fun, says Laubach. ``I can say you need to run three or
four miles a day, but if you say, 'I hate to run,' I better be able
to give you an alternative to running.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the American Dietetic Association is giving exercise equal
billing in its National Nutrition Month campaign this month. ``Food
and fitness: health for a lifetime'' is the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Not that nutrition isn't a sizable problem itself. In a World
Health Organization survey last month of 28 countries, American
15-year-olds ranked in the top three for consuming sweets,
chocolate and soft drinks every day, and fifth in fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fast food is a big problem,'' Laubach says. ``They're easy,
quick and relatively inexpensive meals, but they're loaded with
fat.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that much harder to stock up at home with quick meals
and snacks, Huelsman says. Many low-calorie frozen entrees heat up
in a hurry. Ham and turkey sandwiches are healthier than hot dogs,
bologna or drive-through burgers. Fresh fruits and vegetables are
not only nutritious, ``but they also help to fill kids up,''
leaving less room for potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists stress variety in the recommended daily allotments
of three to five servings of vegetables and two to four of fruits.
But be realistic, many say. Broken rules are better than abandoned
health programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no 'good' foods or 'bad' foods,'' says Bier, the
Baylor physician. ``But there are good diets and bad diets.''
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHY TIPS
</P>
<P>
   The Body Shop is The Children's Medical Center's weight-control
program for children 8 to 13 who are anywhere from mildly to
severely overweight. The 10 weekly sessions teach children and
parents healthy eating habits and exercises for one hour, then
separate the children and parents for the next hour to talk to
psychologists about weight-related issues and decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should not put their children on diets, says Huelsman.
Consistent habits are better, such as these tips Children's offers
for healthy weight loss:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the reduced-fat versions of dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Serve turkey, fish and chicken more than red meat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bake instead of fry.

   FIGURING YOUR BODY MASS INDEX (BMI)
</P>
<P>
   Anyone past his 18th birthday is considered overweight if his
body mass index is between 25 and 29.9 and obese if it's 30 or
higher. BMI is based on height and weight but not sex.
</P>
<P>
   To figure BMI, first multiply your height in meters by itself.
Then divide that number into your weight in kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   To determine your height in meters, divide your height in inches
by 39.37. So if you're 5 feet 9 inches, that is 69 inches or 1.75
meters. Multiply 1.75 by itself and you have 3.0625.
</P>
<P>
   To determine your weight in kilograms, divide your weight in
pounds by 2.2. If you're 200 pounds, that's 90.91 kilograms. Divide
that by 3.0625 and you get a BMI of 29.7, roughly a double
cheeseburger away from obesity. (There are a number of BMI charts
on the Internet that do the figuring for you, including
www.efit.com.)
</P>
<P>
   A one-unit increase in BMI raises the medical charges of someone
older than 40 by 1.9 percent, according to a report in the Dec. 15
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. That's
about 6 3/4 pounds if you're 5-feet-9.
</P>
<P>
   The same study calculated that each additional day of physical
activity per week reduces medical charges by 4.7 percent.

 &HT;    You can cook without being a slave to the kitchen
 &HT;    By Carol Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's challenging to do it all: have a career,
pursue interests of your own, raise a family, take the kids to
activities _ and put home-cooked meals on the table day after day.
Frozen dinners, pizza delivery and expensive take-out have been
convenient substitutes but not the only answers to your dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   You could actually cook. You don't have to be Martha Stewart
with a professional kitchen and a staff of 20 to prepare
great-tasting dinners at home. Nor do you have to spend all night
making them.
</P>
<P>
   Following are three tasty meals that can be prepared easily in
15 to 20 minutes. Some of the recipes call for microwaving and
others employ a combination of little-used large kitchen appliances
like the broiler and the range top. Soon you can be on your way to
enjoying some real home-cooked food ``chez vous.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK AND HEARTY CHICKEN VEGETABLE SOUP WITH CHEESE CROSTINIS
</P>
<P>
   4 chicken breasts (boneless, skinless washed with all visible
fat removed)
</P>
<P>
   4 cups canned chicken broth or 4 cups bouillon made from
bouillon cubes according to package directions
</P>
<P>
   2 medium carrots, peeled and grated
</P>
<P>
   1 medium zucchini, grated
</P>
<P>
   1 medium yellow squash, grated
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 baguette, sliced diagonally (2 to 3 slices per person)
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup shredded Cheddar or Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Cut the breasts into 1/2-inch strips then into 1/2-inch cubes.
In a medium saucepan, place the cubed chicken and the chicken broth
or bouillon and cook over medium heat for about 8 to 10 minutes.
Add the grated carrots, zucchini and yellow squash and cook 2 to 3
minutes (cook longer if you do not want the vegetables al dente).
Adjust the seasonings. While the vegetables cook, place the sliced
bread in the toaster or on a baking sheet under the broiler and
toast light to medium. If desired, drizzle or brush a little olive
oil on each slice of toast. Sprinkle the toasts with the cheese and
broil until melted. The crostinis can be dipped into the soup or
eaten as is. The soup holds well, and the leftovers make a great
lunch. Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   TIME-SAVING TIPS:
</P>
<P>
   _ Double the recipe and freeze half for another meal or freeze
as individual portions for lunch or if dining alone.
</P>
<P>
   _ When buying cheese, shred or grate it all at once so its ready
to top main dishes, soups, toasts or put in omelets for a quick
meal. If you buy pre-shredded cheese, be aware that some brands
have salt added. And nearly all bags of pre-shredded cheese have
been tossed with powdered cellulose to prevent clumping. This is
not a problem for tacos, soups and salads, but cooks have
experienced problems when trying to use pre-shredded cheese in
recipes such as cheese straws.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grate all veggies together using a food processor.
</P>
<P>
   _ For an economy meal, reduce the chicken in the recipe to 1 or
2 breasts and add some cooked pasta.
</P>
<P>
   MUSTARD PINEAPPLE HAM STEAK WITH SWEET POTATOES AND GREEN SALAD
</P>
<P>
   2 large sweet potatoes
</P>
<P>
   8-ounce can crushed pineapple
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon favorite mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 to 1/2-pound ham steak per person
</P>
<P>
   4 cups mixed salad greens, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   Favorite salad dressing
</P>
<P>
   Sour cream and butter, optional
</P>
<P>
   Place the broiler rack about 6 inches from the broiler. Turn on
the broiler to high. Scrub the potatoes and cut a 2-inch slit in
each. Place them in the microwave and set the timer for about 14
minutes (time may vary according to wattage). Microwave them until
the centers are soft when pierced with a folk.
</P>
<P>
   While they are cooking, place the ham steaks on a pan. Drain the
pineapple and reserve the juice. Combine the mustard, sugar and
cloves with the drained crushed pineapple. Spread it evenly on the
ham steaks. Place the steaks under the broiler until browned, about
8 to 10 minutes. Place the reserved juice in a small saucepan and
heat it until it reduces a little.
</P>
<P>
   Cut cooked sweet potatoes in half length-wise and mash them in
their shells adding sour cream and/or butter if you wish. Place a
half on each plate along with the ham steak and a cup of salad that
has been tossed with dressing. Spoon the reduced pineapple juice
over the ham and serve. Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   TIME-SAVING TIPS:
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy the ham steaks pre-packaged or have the deli counter or
the butcher cut them to order.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a big batch of your favorite salad dressing and keep it
in a jar in the fridge for quick access.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash all salad greens when you buy them and keep them in
plastic bags for use during the week. The same goes for tomatoes,
carrots, cucumbers and other favorite salad additions.
</P>
<P>
   _ If a meal requires boiling water or using the oven, turn it on
as soon as you enter the house, before you take off your shoes.
</P>
<P>
   STUFFED BELL PEPPERS WITH NEW POTATOES
</P>
<P>
   2 medium green, red or yellow bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   12 size C red new potatoes, scrubbed
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ground lean beef, turkey or chicken
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 small onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and coarse black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cooked rice or fresh breadcrumbs or 1/4 cup dry
breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons mixed fresh minced herbs or 2 teaspoons mixed dry
herbs (examples: parsley, sage, oregano)
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, crushed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter (optional)
</P>
<P>
   8-ounce can tomato sauce or favorite spaghetti sauce
</P>
<P>
   Wash and dry peppers. Cut them in half from stem to bottom.
Remove stem, seeds and white ribs. Set aside. Scrub the potatoes
and cut them in quarters. Mix the rest of the ingredients except
the butter and the sauce. Fill each of the pepper halves with 1/4
of the meat mixture. Place the filled peppers and potatoes in a
microwave-safe baking dish just large enough to hold them. Sprinkle
the potatoes with salt and pepper. Pour the tomato sauce over the
peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the dish with its own lid or microwave-safe plastic wrap
and prick about 3 holes in the plastic. Microwave on high for about
20 minutes. Time may vary depending on oven wattage. Carefully
remove cover or plastic wrap. Place a pepper on each plate. Spoon
some sauce over each pepper and coarsely mash the potatoes in the
remaining sauce, adding the optional butter at this time. Divide
the potatoes among the plates and serve immediately. Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   TIME-SAVING TIPS:
</P>
<P>
   _ For a penny-saver dish, use only half the meat in the recipe
and substitute 1 cup of rice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep bags of chopped onions and bags of mixed fresh herbs
minced in bags in the freezer for quick access.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy garlic already minced in jars and keep in the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Double the recipe and freeze half for another meal. (Cook each
recipe separately in the microwave oven before freezing.)
</P>
<P>
   For variety and another quick meal try the meat mixture as a
meat loaf or as meatballs. (Use bread crumbs for meatballs if
serving with pasta.)

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH:
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Suppose obesity were an infectious disease, Lloyd
Laubach says. Imagine how many billions of dollars the government
would be spending to wipe out a health hazard that costs more than
$100 billion a year in medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people doing a lot of research in this field who
don't think we'll be able to turn this thing around,'' says
Laubach, who chairs the health and sport science department at the
University of Dayton. ``It's truly, truly scary. The numbers just
keep growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of American adults are overweight, as defined by a body
mass index of 25 or more, says Shape Up America!, an organization
dedicated to bringing down that figure. The 18 percent classified
in 1998 as obese, their BMIs at least 30, represented a 50 percent
increase in just seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``About one child in five weighs too much,'' Dr. Dennis Bier of
the Baylor College of Medicine told a national conference on
childhood obesity at Georgetown University last month. And
three-quarters of obese teen-agers will remain obese through
adulthood, says Mary Ellen Huelsman, the registered dietitian who
runs The Children's Medical Center's Body Shop class for weight
control and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity makes people more vulnerable to heart disease, cancer,
arthritis, asthma, sleep apnea and adult-onset diabetes. High blood
pressure is showing up in children as young as 2, the American
Heart Association reported last week. ``In terms of cancer
prevention, a healthy diet and exercise are as important as not
smoking,'' says Dr. Dennis Savaiano, chairman of the Food and
Nutrition Science Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's something we need to address early on,'' Huelsman
says. ``I'm talking about the kindergarten level. Healthy eating
habits need to be formed then.''
</P>
<P>
   First grade isn't too late, though, and neither is high school.
Schools could teach kids ways to enjoy physical activity for a
lifetime, Laubach and Huelsman agree. They just don't make it a
priority. Nor do parents help kids learn how the quick meals of
today's family lifestyles can also be healthy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer is to move more and eat less, or at least eat
fewer calories. But that of course is no more helpful than saying
anyone can get rich in the stock market if they only would buy low
and sell high.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pratt always has known exercise and good nutrition were
good for her. The UD sophomore has decided several times to start
getting in shape. ``I'd be good at it for two or three weeks, and
then I'd quit,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now 19, she credits a UD conditioning class for helping break
that pattern. She learned getting in shape doesn't have to feel
like a punishment. It's OK to work out in 20-minute spurts instead
of an hour at a time. It's OK to lift weights three days a week,
run three days a week, then eat and do whatever she feels like on
the seventh day.
</P>
<P>
   To her amazement, she learned working out can be something she
looks forward to _ a better study break even than a snack and TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize that not only is it good for your body, but
it's good for your overall mental, physical and emotional health,''
Pratt says. ``It makes you feel better. It raises your
self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   She has more energy. Even studying isn't the drag it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   She feels better about her appearance. She's no longer hesitant
to join friends in a basketball game or something else that's
physical.
</P>
<P>
   She's more alert. She doesn't need as much sleep, and she wakes
up more refreshed from the sleep she gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised at how much easier it is to motivate myself to
go out there and work out,'' she says. Even if the day isn't going
so well, ``I have exercise to fall back on. It's something I know
is going to make me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose Pratt and millions of other teen-agers would learn that
at younger ages, Laubach suggests. His biggest beef is that nearly
every state has scratched physical education from its daily school
curriculum. ``A major problem,'' he calls it. Besides that, some
high schools and junior highs have done away with intramural sports
to free up field and gymnasium time for the varsity teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do that stuff and they forget to educate the masses,''
Laubach says. He says George DeMarco of his department is working
on a program to offer local schools called ACES, for ``All Children
Exercising Simultaneously.'' The idea is for several schools to
commit to two times a day when all their students will exercise for
10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise is no more optional than clean air, pure water and
nutritious food, says biologist Frank Booth of the University of
Missouri. Attributing 250,000 deaths a year to inactivity, Booth
has organized Scientists Against Inactivity-Related Diseases as an
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Even when schools have phys-ed classes, Huelsman says, ``They
don't really teach kids physical fitness that they can use for a
lifetime.'' They teach soccer, basketball and softball, phys-ed
advocates complained at the Georgetown obesity conference, with
some occasional lap running for punishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools should be teaching swimming, tennis, aerobics, weight
lifting, walking even,'' Huelsman says. UD offers that kind of
class. Self-defense and dancing classes don't even require special
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to call it movement rather than exercise,'' Huelsman
says. ``So many people think you need to do an hour workout for it
to be beneficial. Take a walk around the neighborhood with your
family, 10 or 15 minutes. Walk the dog. Mow the lawn. Rake the
leaves. Use the stairs instead of the elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   Have fun, says Laubach. ``I can say you need to run three or
four miles a day, but if you say, 'I hate to run,' I better be able
to give you an alternative to running.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the American Dietetic Association is giving exercise equal
billing in its National Nutrition Month campaign this month. ``Food
and fitness: health for a lifetime'' is the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Not that nutrition isn't a sizable problem itself. In a World
Health Organization survey last month of 28 countries, American
15-year-olds ranked in the top three for consuming sweets,
chocolate and soft drinks every day, and fifth in fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fast food is a big problem,'' Laubach says. ``They're easy,
quick and relatively inexpensive meals, but they're loaded with
fat.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that much harder to stock up at home with quick meals
and snacks, Huelsman says. Many low-calorie frozen entrees heat up
in a hurry. Ham and turkey sandwiches are healthier than hot dogs,
bologna or drive-through burgers. Fresh fruits and vegetables are
not only nutritious, ``but they also help to fill kids up,''
leaving less room for potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists stress variety in the recommended daily allotments
of three to five servings of vegetables and two to four of fruits.
But be realistic, many say. Broken rules are better than abandoned
health programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no 'good' foods or 'bad' foods,'' says Bier, the
Baylor physician. ``But there are good diets and bad diets.''
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHY TIPS
</P>
<P>
   The Body Shop is The Children's Medical Center's weight-control
program for children 8 to 13 who are anywhere from mildly to
severely overweight. The 10 weekly sessions teach children and
parents healthy eating habits and exercises for one hour, then
separate the children and parents for the next hour to talk to
psychologists about weight-related issues and decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should not put their children on diets, says Huelsman.
Consistent habits are better, such as these tips Children's offers
for healthy weight loss:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the reduced-fat versions of dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Serve turkey, fish and chicken more than red meat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bake instead of fry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bread, cereals, rice and pasta aren't fattening unless you add
fat to them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy lower-fat ground round or sirloin instead of ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some low-calorie snacks are light popcorn, pretzels, vanilla
wafers, animal crackers, low-fat wheat crackers, yogurt and frozen
yogurt, fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drink water or sugar-free drinks instead of high-calorie
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have three meals and two snacks a day for the family. Children
will have more energy and be less likely to be hungry enough to pig
out on the wrong things.

<P>
   FIGURING YOUR BODY MASS INDEX (BMI)
</P>
<P>
   Anyone past his 18th birthday is considered overweight if his
body mass index is between 25 and 29.9 and obese if it's 30 or
higher. BMI is based on height and weight but not sex.
</P>
<P>
   To figure BMI, first multiply your height in meters by itself.
Then divide that number into your weight in kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   To determine your height in meters, divide your height in inches
by 39.37. So if you're 5 feet 9 inches, that is 69 inches or 1.75
meters. Multiply 1.75 by itself and you have 3.0625.
</P>
<P>
   To determine your weight in kilograms, divide your weight in
pounds by 2.2. If you're 200 pounds, that's 90.91 kilograms. Divide
that by 3.0625 and you get a BMI of 29.7, roughly a double
cheeseburger away from obesity. (There are a number of BMI charts
on the Internet that do the figuring for you, including
www.efit.com.)
</P>
<P>
   A one-unit increase in BMI raises the medical charges of someone
older than 40 by 1.9 percent, according to a report in the Dec. 15
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. That's
about 6 3/4 pounds if you're 5-feet-9.
</P>
<P>
   The same study calculated that each additional day of physical
activity per week reduces medical charges by 4.7 percent.

find out. (Murray, Cox News Service). 16.

<P>
   MONEYTALK _ Experts suggest starting your countdown to
retirement as much as 10 years before you expect to retire. Here is
a checklist _ by no means all-inclusive _ of things to do.(Ezell,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED TUESDAY.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   BUYER'S-EDGE _ While much collective anxiety about traveling is
spent on plane crashes, food or motion sickness, overbooked hotels,
inclement weather, some concern is designated to the inevitable
question of what to pack. Equally important, however, and often
neglected, is what to pack things in. Everything you need to know
about purchasing luggage. (Gonzalez, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

hard-to-fnd items. This week: (Johnson, Atlanta

in the Southeast. This week: (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

<P>
   NEWS-QUESTIONS _ Q&AMP;A on the news, in two takes. (Bessonnette,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (EDS: Moving on l (Lifestyle) and a
(General News) categories.)
</P>
<P>
   NUTSNBOLTS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Trees and shrubs that shed their
leaves last fall are on the verge of greening up again, so if you
have any pruning to do, you'd better do it quickly. It's also a
good time to get a head start on the grass cutting season by
getting your lawn mower ready. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE/HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   OBESITY _ Suppose obesity were an infectious disease, Lloyd
Laubach says. Imagine how many billions of dollars the government
would be spending to wipe out a health hazard that costs more than
$100 billion a year in medical expenses. Three-quarters of obese
teen-agers will remain obese through adulthood, says Mary Ellen
Huelsman, the registered dietitian who runs The Children's Medical
Center's Body Shop class for weight control and nutrition. Schools
could teach kids ways to enjoy physical activity for a lifetime,
Laubach and Huelsman agree. They just don't make it a priority. Nor
do parents help kids learn how the quick meals of today's family
lifestyles can also be healthy, they say. (Lamb, Dayton Daily
News).
</P>
<P>
   FOOD
</P>
<P>
   RAYMOND-BRACIOLE _ Since last week's episode of Everybody loves
Raymond in which an Italian dish called braciole was featured
prominently, the food section has received numerous inquiries about
what it is. We tell them -- and share a recipe. (Parham, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)WITH PHOTOS.

</P>
<P>
   CYBERSPICE _ Cyber Spice listing of websites for info on
braciole, to go with Betty Parham's story on braciole. (Parham,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   FOOD-RECIPESWAP _Marcia Langhenry's recipe swap column is not
available this week.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-ETHNIC _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Exotic ingredients for ethnic
cooking have gone mainstream. (Heller, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   WINE-COLUMN _ With winemaker Jean-Marie Guffens, everything is
I, I, I. Irascible, irreverent and iconoclastic. Guffens, a Belgian
who moved to France to make a broad line of high-quality,
competitively priced white Burgundy under the Verget label he
founded, dropped in for a quick luncheon last week during a
five-city, five-day whirlwind stateside tour. (Fisher, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   RUSHHOUR-REMEDIES _ It is challenging to do it all: have a
career; interests of your own, raise a family; take the kids to
activities, and put home-cooked meals on the table day after day.
Frozen dinners, pizza delivery and expensive take-out have been
convenient substitutes but not the only answers to your dilemma.
Following are three tasty meals that can be prepared easily in 15
to 20 minutes. (Johnson, Austin American-Statesman) WITH PHOTOS.

   BRIDGET-JONES _ ATLANTA _ She's back, and the good news (or bad,
depending on your perspective) is that she hasn't changed one whit.
Bridget Jones _ the ``Rainman''-esque counter of calories consumed,
cigarettes smoked and anonymous hangup calls to ex-boyfriends made
in 1998's bestselling novel ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' has turned up
just as flustered again in a sequel. When British author Helen
Fielding unleashed Bridget on America two years ago, the
comparisons to TV's Ally McBeal were too choice for many reviewers
and readers to resist _ pro and con. Indeed, for every female
reader who thinks of Bridget, ``She's just like me,'' there are
others who think she's set womankind back about 50 years.

 &HT;    PREGNANCY HAS CHERIE BLAIR'S IMAGE AS 'SUPERWOMAN,' 'WORKING
MOTHER' POSITIVELY GLOWING
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<P>
   LONDON _ Before her death, it was Princess Diana who beguiled
the nation, indeed the world.
</P>
<P>
   But now another British woman is moving precariously close to
filling the much-beloved princess' shoes: Cherie Blair, wife of
Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs' domestic life has long appealed to the public. The
world was captivated, for example, by photographs of a scruffy
Cherie Blair bringing in the milk in her wrinkled nightshirt the
morning after her husband's election. But interest in the pair
soared to new heights last November when it was announced that
Cherie Blair, aged 45, was pregnant with
</P>
<P>
   her fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Blair baby has become the most talked about
pregnancy since those of Princess Di.
</P>
<P>
   It also has many celebrities here enthusiastically reciting the
virtues of late motherhood in the British press. Iman, the
44-year-old model wife of singer David Bowie, himself age 53,
recently gushed that she is to be a mother again.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Princess Di, though, Cherie Blair finds herself cast not
as an archetype of a charitable, yet jet-setting, young beauty, but
that of an older mother struggling to juggle career and family
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Already well-known around the world as a working mother, many
women are able to identify with Cherie Blair as she embarks on
another round of breastfeeding and sleepless nights, while still
working towards her long-time goal of becoming a judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pregnancy is going to bring a new challenge,'' Maggie Rea,
an attorney and family friend, told The Daily Telegraph. ``But I am
sure she will handle it fantastically well. She is very fit and
well, and has already proved she can cope with motherhood, a
career, and supporting her husband too.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair seems to have fared better than her friend, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who has often expressed regret in public over
having had only one child.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs already have three children: Euan, 15, Nicholas, 14,
and Kathryn, 11.
</P>
<P>
   But the expected birth in May of the first child in 150 years
fathered by a sitting British prime minister is sure to drastically
change the public and private lives of Britain's first couple.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the New Labour Party machine is not unaware of the
kick it will give Tony Blair's ``family man'' image with a general
election still more than a year away.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair, whose own actor father, Tony Booth, abandoned the
family for another woman when she was 21 months old, is likely to
become even more protective of her own family. Already Cherie
Blair, who does not give press interviews, goes to great lengths to
shield them from the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Blairs seem to have adopted an almost royal-like
attitude to being left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week Tony Blair vowed to do ``whatever it takes'' to
protect the privacy of his family and prevent intrusion into the
lives of his children.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge came just after the family's lawyers sought _ and
were granted _ an injunction preventing The Mail on Sunday(CQ)
newspaper from publishing material based on a book about the family
by Ros Mark, 30, who worked as the Blairs' nanny from 1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherie and I are absolutely determined, no matter how unusual
our own lives may be because of the nature of my job, that our
children have as normal an upbringing as possible,'' Tony Blair
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, interest in the Blairs and their soon-to-be-expanded
brood is not likely to wane any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair has come to epitomize the successful woman of the
21st Century with her seemingly tranquil home life, glamorous
social life, and esteemed career as a barrister focusing on
employment law.
</P>
<P>
   Only last June she was made a recorder _ a junior part-time
judge. Within three years she could be eligible for a full-time
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``She certainly seems to have it all, and she's become a
powerful role model for little girls across the country,'' said Sue
Holmes, a secretary and mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   Like Princess Di, Cherie Blair receives hundreds of letters a
week. At the same time, she promotes the Malcolm Sargent Cancer
Care for Children, one of the princess' favorite charities.
</P>
<P>
   And, like the princess, Cherie Blair's wardrobe is heavily
scrutinized. Over the past year many pundits here have referred to
her as ``an excellent ambassador for British fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, experience has taught her to look her best.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, attention was distracted from the purpose of her
husband's visit to South Africa when the press criticized her on
the front pages as looking ``dowdy'' in a green floral dress.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the princess, though, Cherie Blair seems to have trained
her husband well. Tony Blair calls himself a ``nappy-changing new
man'' who doesn't mind staying up at night with a new baby. A
government spokesman said he will take paternity leave when his
fourth child is born _ though it will likely be less than the
maximum three months unpaid leave now allowed under government
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known how long Cherie Blair will take off, although _
in typical superwoman fashion _ she was back at work within two
days after the birth of her youngest, Kathryn.

 &HT;    CLINTON POINT MAN ON THE AMERICAS KEEPS FOCUS ON ISSUES CLOSE TO
HOME

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The view from Buddy MacKay's office is of the White
House. Behind his desk is a map stretching from the southern United
States to the tip of South America.
</P>
<P>
   This is Kenneth H. ``Buddy'' MacKay's world. For the past year,
the former Florida governor has been President Clinton's special
envoy to the Americas _ a territory covering the entire Western
Hemisphere, including Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The job has taken MacKay, 66, to an average of two countries a
month _ listening to their leaders and communicating their problems
on at least a weekly basis to the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, communications break down.
</P>
<P>
   Like the time MacKay participated in a news conference in Chile
speaking through an interpreter. The first question was
particularly tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa! That one was high and inside,'' MacKay quipped, hoping
to get a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone stopped and got very quiet,'' MacKay recalled. ``The
Chilean interpreter didn't have any idea what I was saying. I said,
'That's baseball.' He didn't have any idea what baseball was.''
</P>
<P>
   With the news conference rapidly disintegrating, MacKay tried
explaining the sport. Someone suggested he use a soccer analogy.
MacKay didn't know one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a good lesson that day,'' he said. ``Our culture
really is different. Some things we take for granted, they don't
have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Although MacKay is trying to learn Spanish, he described his
linguistic ability as ``rough and slow.'' Even so, he said the
people he deals with appreciate his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to judge my success in this office by how well
I speak Spanish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most surprising aspects of the past year, MacKay
said, is the lack of interest and information about the importance
of Latin America among U.S. business and government leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to try to get this country, and our government, to
face north and south for our future instead of east and west.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, much of his time has been spent lobbying Congress to
approve a $1 billion military aid package to Colombia and to pass a
trade bill expanding the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI).
</P>
<P>
   It's a return of sorts. MacKay spent six years in the House of
Representatives where, among other posts, he served on the Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombia aid is necessary, MacKay said to counter the
alliance of guerrilla groups with the powerful drug cartels and
organized crime that threatens to plunge one of South America's
oldest democracies into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay said Miami has already experienced an influx of business
and government leaders from Colombia, fleeing the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Colombia destabilizes, we will get not only the leadership,
but a large number of immigrants, and that is tough on our
economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging he's concerned about a recent Human Rights Watch
report linking the Colombian military to right-wing paramilitary
groups, MacKay said many of the cases in the report may be related
to prior Colombian regimes and may not reflect the current
political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   His other legislative priority, the CBI expansion bill, is
important to the United States because the Caribbean countries have
become such a large trading partner, MacKay said. Since the
original CBI was passed in the 1980s, U.S. trade with the region
has increased six-fold, becoming the United States' sixth-largest
trading partner and exceeding our combined exports to Russia, China
and India.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay's biggest long-range effort is to lay the foundation for
a hemispheric Free Trade Area for the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of the FTAA was first endorsed at the 1994 Summit of
the Americas in Miami which MacKay _ then Florida's lieutenant
governor _ played a major role in organizing. Under FTAA, tariff
rates across the entire hemisphere (except Cuba) would be lowered
and eventually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay also is working hard to have a U.S. city _ Miami and New
Orleans are top contenders _ picked as the permanent secretariat
for the Americas, a role similar to that of Brussels for the
European Union. Other major candidates include Mexico City and
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay foresees a future in which the United States, despite the
overwhelming size of its economy, plays a major, but not dominant,
role in a hemispheric community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building a community of the Americas much like the
European community. It's more than just trade agreements; it's far
more than that,'' he said. ``I see our role as more of a
partnership and less of being the bully on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the administration job meant leaving Florida for awhile.
MacKay and his wife, Anne, live on the same floor of a building in
downtown Washington as another Floridian, Attorney General Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, MacKay _ who was the Florida Clinton-Gore
chairman in 1992 and 1996 _ said he hasn't seriously looked past
the November election. If Vice President Gore is elected and asks
him to serve in the next administration, MacKay said he's
available.

<P>
   For working people there are three ways to entertain guests for
dinner at home: Hire a caterer, stay home from work or prepare the
meal ahead of time over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Today's menu with a seafood stew and linguine is for the
cook-ahead crowd. It is the way I always entertain, taking several
nights after work to prepare the dishes and either freezing or
refrigerating them.
</P>
<P>
   I also set the table the night before. No matter what I serve, I
keep it simple. Then the evening of the dinner there is little left
to do.
</P>
<P>
   For this dinner it is a matter of cooking the pasta, reheating
the sauce and throwing in the fish for a few minutes. You can heat
up some nice crusty country bread while the pasta is cooking.
</P>
<P>
   For the salad the only work is to arrange the salad and cheese
on individual plates, drizzling on the dressing. The dessert calls
for spooning the wine sauce over the sorbet, which has already been
put into individual dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The seafood stew can be made two days in advance and
refrigerated or it can be made a couple of weeks in advance and
frozen.
</P>
<P>
   All of the components of the salad can be prepared the night
before, as can the dessert.
</P>
<P>
   SEAFOOD STEW OVER LINGUINE
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds finely chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds finely chopped green pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 stalks finely chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds ripe plum tomatoes, coarsely cubed or 8 cups canned
drained tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   3 cups fish stock or clam juice
</P>
<P>
   1 large bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pound firm white fish fillet such as black sea bass or
cod, cut in large chunks
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound shrimp, shelled and left whole if small or cut in half
or thirds, depending on size
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds fresh spinach linguine
</P>
<P>
   1. Saute the onion in hot oil in nonstick pan. When onion has
softened and started to brown, add the green pepper, celery and
garlic and continue cooking until pepper and celery begin to
soften. Add the tomatoes, wine, stock, bay leaf, tomato paste,
thyme and parsley and continue cooking for about 5 minutes.
Refrigerate or freeze.
</P>
<P>
   2. To serve, defrost if frozen; bring the water for the pasta to
a boil; reheat sauce until very hot. Cook the pasta according to
directions. Add the fish and shrimp to the tomato mixture for two
to three minutes. Serve seafood stew with the linguine.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   FENNEL AND PARMIGIANO REGGIANO
</P>

</P>
<P>
   1. Trim the bottoms and top stem leaves from the fennel. You can
reserve a few feathery leaves for garnish, if desired. Slice off
the bottom and discard the tough outer pieces. Slice the fennel
bulbs very, very thin. You can use a mandoline, the very thin
slicing disk of a food processor, the slicing side of a four-sided
grater or a very sharp knife.
</P>
<P>
   2. Whisk together the oil and lemon juice and season with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   3. Wrap the fennel slices in plastic wrap; wrap the cheese
slices in plastic wrap. Cover the dressing and refrigerate these
three components overnight, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, divide the fennel among 6 salad plates in a single
layer. Break up the cheese slices and arrange over the fennel.
Drizzle dressing over each portion and serve.

<P>
   When Emmanuel Mignot opened the door, a dachshund bounded into
the basement room at Stanford University's Sleep Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, a dozen men and women exchanged nervous
glances. Now they watched as Mignot's associate, Seiji Nishino,
reached for his research tool: a can of dog food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allez Beau teckel!'' said Mignot, a native of Paris, as he
knelt to rub the dog's belly.
</P>
<P>
   Beau seemed an excitable but ordinary dog. His regular food was
dry pellets. But today, Beau would get canned dog food _ a special
treat.
</P>
<P>
   Nishino spooned the wet food onto the floor, and Mignot cooed,
``C'est de la bonne viande.'' Beau perked up, trotted happily to
the food, sniffed, rolled his eyes in pleasurable anticipation _
and dropped to the concrete, limp as an empty sock.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors, members of a narcolepsy support group from
California's East Bay area, awwwwwww-ed in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic symptoms of narcolepsy, the disorder in
which sleep instantly overwhelms a person during the day, is
collapse triggered by excitement or strong emotions. So what
happened to Beau, a narcoleptic dog, did not surprise the people in
the room.
</P>
<P>
   As a lab researcher with a Ph.D. in molecular pharmacology,
Mignot believes he has finally discovered the key to understanding
narcolepsy. Last August, Mignot announced that he and others
experimenting with a colony of narcoleptic dogs had identified the
gene that causes narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, a few weeks later molecular geneticist Masashi
Yanagisawa and his colleagues at the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
announced they had found a closely associated gene in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of scientists believe their discoveries could soon
lead to an effective treatment for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Narcoleptics are not the only ones for whom the new findings
offer cause for hope. Ultimately millions of Americans, including
everyone who has insomnia or is overweight, could benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping and eating are linked both behaviorally and
evolutionarily. When Yanagisawa found the sleep gene in mice, he
was studying a gene for eating. They turned out to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the identification of the gene could also lead to
the creation of drugs to suppress appetite and fight obesity. Drug
companies are already working on it.
</P>
<P>
   In the faulty gene Mignot and Yanagisawa uncovered, a
straightforward biogenetic mechanism has gone awry. A normal cell
has chemical receptors on its surface that link up with specific
molecules generated by the body and control the timing of such
functions as eating and sleeping. If the receptor genes don't work
(as in narcoleptic dogs), or if the chemical isn't produced (as in
the mice), things go wrong. The challenge is to discover how the
mechanism breaks down in narcoleptic humans and then to develop
drugs that correct it.
</P>
<P>
   Narcolepsy is characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness,
involuntary sleep attacks, paralysis, hallucinations and, in severe
cases, episodes of cataplexy in which a person _ usually in the
grip of strong emotion _ suddenly loses muscle tone and goes limp.
That's what happened to Beau when he sniffed that dog food.
</P>
<P>
   Narcolepsy usually shows itself during adolescence or in the
early 20s, ``a really tough time,'' Mignot notes. ``At an age when
narcoleptics want to conform, they get so excited they fall down.''
</P>
<P>
   In one study of 500 narcoleptics, 85 percent said the disorder
had reduced their job performance, 33 percent said their
medications reduced their sex drive, 15 percent were permanently
disabled and many reported impaired memory and concentration.
</P>
<P>
   In its worst form, the malady can destroy a person's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without medication, I can hardly do anything,'' says Mali
Einen, 38. She discovered she was narcoleptic at age 24 when her
baby daughter, Kelsey, said something funny during a Christmas
celebration. At that moment, Mali suddenly collapsed ``like a
puppet with its strings cut, right into the Christmas tree,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Einen's life has changed. She was a single mom with
a successful career as a hedge-fund money manager. But as her
narcolepsy grew worse, she had increasing difficulty coping with it
at work and at home. Once, passed out and dreaming that someone had
broken into the house, she woke up, dialed 9-1-1 and screamed, then
had to explain what had happened to the police.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't worked or dated in years, and only medication keeps
her alert enough to get through the day. She and Kelsey, now 16,
live alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been lonely,'' she says resignedly. ``Life is lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   What we call narcolepsy was first noted by French physician
Jean-Baptiste Edouard Gelineau in the 1880s. Normal people remain
wakeful during the day, then pass through three stages at night:
wakefulness, non-REM sleep and REM sleep _ in that order. REM
sleep, named for the rapid eye movements that accompany it, is the
dreaming stage of sleep. In narcoleptics, however, REM sleep
arrives out of order. Usually triggered by emotion, it abruptly
follows the wakeful stage, and the person slumps into a waking
dream.
</P>
<P>
   So far, even the best available drugs treat only symptoms.
Amphetamines and other stimulants keep the narcoleptic awake;
antidepressants fight off cataplexy.
</P>
<P>
   Einen took Ritalin for a year, then found she was building a
tolerance to it. So she switched to Dexadrine, an addictive
stimulant she has relied on for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Einen now takes an experimental drug, gamma
hydroxybutyrate, which she says knocks her into a deep, restorative
sleep, but only for two or three hours. Then she has to get up and
take another dose. ``I still need naps,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mignot's research has shown that dogs inherit narcolepsy much
like human beings do; some siblings get it and some don't. For a
decade, Mignot and his colleagues have scrutinized the dogs' DNA,
comparing it with that of normal littermates until, in 1998, they
narrowed the defect down to a single chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   All the complex set of symptoms that add up to narcolepsy
results from tiny changes in that single gene, a receptor in the
dogs' brains intended to receive molecular signals from chemicals
called hypocretins, also known as orexins.
</P>
<P>
   Think of brain cells as rooms with locks called receptors on
their surfaces and a hypocretin as a key that is also a stimulant.
In a normal animal, the hypocretin hooks up with the lock, opens it
and stimulates it to increase electrical activity _ to be alert.
Without the receptor gene, however, the key won't open the lock and
can't stimulate the brain cell. That's what's wrong in the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In Yanagisawa's mice, the receptor is present but the hypocretin
isn't. In other words, the lock has no key. But the effect is the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the same in humans? And can we use the information to
help narcoleptics? Mignot thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to find drugs that can replace or block or mimic the
effect of the molecule like hypocretin,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Einen remains positive, grabbing 40 winks
whenever she must during the day. She's easy to spot, she says:
``I'm the weirdo in the Burger King parking lot with the doors
locked and the seat pushed back, taking a nap.''  &QL;

<P>
   When he's not dashing down the fast lane at a track meet or
practice, 22-year-old sprinter Rahim Sajan runs for the sake of
science.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Calgary's Human Performance Laboratory, he
stands patiently, one hairy and muscular leg extended, while small
silver balls are taped to strategic sites near his hip, knee and
ankle joints.
</P>
<P>
   Today Sajan will be testing three different pairs of prototype
running shoes fitted with three different soles. As he runs the
length of a 30-meter track, the reflective balls will help video
cameras capture the movement of his joints.
</P>
<P>
   A steel platform embedded in the track's floor will measure the
force exerted when his feet touch down. Then he'll be wired for
treadmill testing, with electrodes like little metal buttons
recording the electrical signals going to his leg muscles as he
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the research is to determine which sole aids his
performance most while protecting him from injury. So far, the
results are leaving common assumptions about running shoes in the
dust.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, for example, that the impact generated during
running is not nearly as damaging as was once thought. A good
running shoe should support the natural alignment of the feet and
legs, rather than correct it. And the lesson for picking the best
shoe for you boils down to this: If it feels good, wear it. That
advice is simple, the biomechanics supporting it is not.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Calgary team is physicist-turned-biomechanist
Benno Nigg. A longtime member of the International Olympic
Committee Medical Commission, Nigg set out to build better running
shoes back when they were still called sneakers. His earlier ideas
helped establish the prevailing belief that the main functions of
running shoes should be to properly align the legs and feet and to
cushion the impact of a heel-toe stride.
</P>
<P>
   But Nigg has since come to question these prescriptions. His
doubts began when he set out to prove that the jarring impact of
running on hard surfaces is a major cause of injury. In fact, he
and others doing similar studies found no relation between the
magnitude of impact forces and the injury rate in runners.
</P>
<P>
   Fast runners, for example, land with two or three times the
force of slower runners, yet in Nigg's studies they were injured no
more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Running on hard surfaces doesn't result in more injuries than
running on soft surfaces. And if the impact from running was
stressful to joints, degenerative joint diseases such as
osteoarthritis would presumably be more common in runners than in
nonrunners. They aren't.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Nigg's studies show that joints are taxed most not
at the moment of initial impact but by the stress on the foot as
the runner's weight rolls from the heel toward the toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces during midstance and takeoff are about three to
five times higher than the forces during landing,'' Nigg says. Thus
he concludes that impact has been unfairly blamed. ``There may be
certain cases where impact produces an injury, but it's not an
epidemic, which the sports-medicine world and the fitness world and
the shoe producers thought was the case. And we thought it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet runners do get hurt; two-thirds of serious runners can
expect to sustain an injury in any given year. And no one would
dispute that cushioned shoes feel better than brogans for a jog
around the park.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes one shoe better than another? Nigg believes the
answer lies in the muscle activation that not only keeps a runner's
posture stable but also counters vibrations of the soft tissue in
the body when a runner's heel strikes the ground. Studies like the
one in which Sajan takes part have shown that muscles tense up in
order to reduce these soft-tissue vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   Studies that correlate muscle activation with both comfort and
oxygen consumption show that the more work the muscles have to do
to minimize soft-tissue vibrations, the less comfortable and more
exhausting running will be.
</P>
<P>
   But Nigg also found that higher impact doesn't necessarily
create more work for the muscles. That's because soft-tissue
vibrations occur at different frequencies in different people, just
as guitar strings of different lengths and diameters resonate at
different frequencies when plucked in the same manner.
</P>
<P>
   In people, the preferred frequencies depend largely on body
weight and muscle tone. So the problem for runners is not so much
the initial force of the impact as its effects on soft tissue.
Running in a particular pair of shoes can amplify the natural
vibrations, and the runner's muscles must work harder to counteract
them.
</P>
<P>
   The cushioning in running shoes can help or hinder how the
body's muscles respond _ or, in Nigg's words, ``tune'' _ by
shifting impact frequencies away from or toward the frequency at
which an individual's soft tissue naturally wants to resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why different people like different shoes,'' Nigg says.
``You can tune yourself to a certain shoe. Or you can choose a shoe
that you don't have to tune too much.''
</P>
<P>
   With the right shoe, the difference in performance, he says,
``is up to 5 percent _ that's eight minutes in a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his findings, Nigg proposes that injuries result when
too much muscle energy is taken up with the task of countering
vibrations rather than with running.
</P>
<P>
   Proper alignment is important, too, but Nigg's ideas about
what's proper have changed since the 1970s. Thirty years ago, he
pioneered the dual-density midsole, a layer of cushioning that is
harder on the inner part of the arch and softer on the outer part,
which helps correct the excessive inward rolling of the foot,
called overpronation, that plagues as many as half of all runners.
Dual-density midsoles have become a standard feature of
high-performance shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of a single model of ideal movement _ the concept
that put a dual-density midsole in every shoe _ Nigg's research
suggests that each body has its own preferred pattern of motion,
which is revealed when a person is running barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles will fight to maintain that template of barefoot
movement if shoes counteract it, Nigg says. But shoes that promote
barefoot alignment will greatly lessen the load on muscles,
improving comfort and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Working from these conclusions, Nigg and his colleagues have
assailed another standard feature of running shoes: the toe spring,
or raised forefront. Toe springs were thought to help the foot rock
forward during a stride, but they may actually impede takeoff by
immobilizing the joints at the ball of the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Nigg's main goal now is to persuade companies to group their
shoe models according to parameters such as degree of cushioning,
dynamic alignment and shape, so that consumers who have found a
model that works for them can easily spot other new or existing
models with the same properties.
</P>
<P>
   Although his colleagues are skeptical, Nigg says, the grouping
system has been well received by shoe manufacturers and could show
up on shelves within five years. Stay tuned. &QL;

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 &HT;    Now's the time to consider a late winter sports vacation to
Utah. From Feb. 8 to 24, 2002, the Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Winter
Games will be off and running.
 &HT;    According to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, more than 3,500
athletes will compete in seven sports and 70 medal events. The
committee has likened hosting the 17-day XIX Olympic Winter Games
to presenting 17 consecutive Super Bowls.
 &HT;    But why go now? While the estimated 1.7 million tickets for the
Games won't go on sale until the fall of 2000, many of the
facilities have already been built and the race courses laid out.
 &HT;    Smart skiers and snowboarders can book a ski vacation in Utah
this season and sample the legendary Wasatch Mountain snow on
uncrowded Olympic courses. Adventurous souls can ride a bobsled 74
mph down the Olympic bobsleigh track or attempt to ski jump.
 &HT;    Salt Lake City is an ideal geographic location for Olympic
events, with nine major ski resorts within an hour's drive of the
city center, the hub of the Games.
 &HT;    Start with Park City, which is less than 45 minutes from Salt
Lake City. This is Utah's premier ski town, a place that still
bears traces of its mining past. The action today, however, can be
found in the trendy restaurants, bars and shops along Main Street.
 &HT;    The Park City Mountain Resort, which bills itself as having
``The Greatest Snow on Earth,'' will host the men's and women's
giant slalom events, as well as snowboarding. For more information,
contact Park City Mountain Resort, P.O. Box 39, Park City, Utah
84060; (800) 222-PARK; www.parkcitymountain.com.
 &HT;    A few minutes away is Deer Valley, the most luxurious ski resort
in Utah, famed for its immaculate snow grooming, fine lodging and
good dining. Four Olympic alpine skiing events will be held here:
the men's and women's slaloms and combined slaloms.
 &HT;    The black-diamond run, called ``Know You Don't,'' will be the
site of the slalom races, while ``Big Stick'' is the choice for the
combined slalom.
 &HT;    Arguably the most exciting event in the Olympics will be held
here as well, the freestyle-skiing competitions of aerials and
moguls. For more information, contact Deer Valley Resort, P.O. Box
1525, Park City, Utah 84060; (800) 558-3337; www.deervalley.com.
 &HT;    Close to Park City is the Utah Winter Sports Park, a 387-acre
facility that will host the bobsleigh, luge, skeleton, ski jumping
and Nordic combined. The skeleton competition is aptly named, since
competitors board a narrow sled that is really just the frame of a
stripped-down bobsled. Riders go headfirst down the icy bobsleigh
track at close to 80 mph.
 &HT;    The 1,335-meter bobsleigh/luge track has five start areas and is
one of only 12 competition-certified ``refrigeration tracks'' in
the world.
 &HT;    In addition to watching American hopefuls practice on the
bobsleigh and luge, a singular highlight is watching others try out
skeleton, which has only twice before been an Olympic sport.
 &HT;    Better yet, amateur bobsleigh enthusiasts can take a ride on the
track. Two guests at a time can ride in a four-man bobsled,
accompanied by a driver and a brakeman. The cost is $125 per person
and reservations are required. Rides on a training device called a
Rocket are $27 per person.
 &HT;    Nordic ski jumping at the Utah Winter Sports Park is available
to the public, but the jumps are not the official Olympic jumps.
Instead, participants use the K-10 meter, K-20 meter and K-40 meter
ski jumps. These jumps are designed so that the jumper is never
more than two feet off the snow.
 &HT;    The Winter Sports Park claims that this is the only public
jumping facility in North America, if not the world. The cost is
$30 for adults, $20 for youths ages 13 to 17, and $15 for those
under age 12. The price includes instruction and a helmet. For more
information, contact the Utah Winter Sports Park, P.O. Box 980337,
Park City, Utah 84098; (435) 658-4200;
http://www.slc2002.org/sports/uwsp_frame.html.
 &HT;    Northwest of Park City, near the city of Ogden, the Snowbasin
Ski Area is the site of six Olympic events, including the men's and
women's downhill, combined downhill and super G races.
 &HT;    The men's downhill course was designed by Olympic Gold medalist
Bernard Russi. It has a vertical drop of 2,770 feet that is
expected to generate race speeds of more than 90 miles per hour.
 &HT;    Amateur skiers can enjoy the vertigo-inducing course at much
slower speeds, of course. And they can enjoy Snowbasin, one of the
great hidden secrets of Utah skiing.
 &HT;    While a new base area for the Olympic Games is being built, this
ski area still has an old-fashioned mom-and-pop feel to it. It's a
large, challenging and uncrowded mountain beloved by Ogden locals,
and the views that stretch into neighboring Nevada and Wyoming are
a bonus. For more information, contact Snowbasin, P.O. Box 460,
Huntsville, Utah 84317; (801) 399-1135; www.snowbasin.com).
 &HT;    For more information about wintertime fun in this part of the
country, contact Ski Utah, 150 West 500 South, Salt Lake City, Utah
84101; (800) 754-8824; www.skiutah.com.
 &HT;    For updates on the Olympic Games, contact the Salt Lake City
Organizing Committee, 257 East 200 South, Salt Lake City, Utah
84111; (801) 212-2002; www.slc2002.org.

facilities have already been built and the race courses laid out.
 &HT;    Smart skiers and snowboarders can book a ski vacation in Utah
this season and sample the legendary Wasatch Mountain snow on
uncrowded Olympic courses. Adventurous souls can ride a bobsled 74
mph down the Olympic bobsleigh track or attempt to ski jump.
 &HT;    Salt Lake City is an ideal geographic location for Olympic
events, with nine major ski resorts within an hour's drive of the
city center, the hub of the Games.
 &HT;    Start with Park City, which is less than 45 minutes from Salt
Lake City. This is Utah's premier ski town, a place that still
bears traces of its mining past. The action today, however, can be
found in the trendy restaurants, bars and shops along Main Street.
 &HT;    The Park City Mountain Resort, which bills itself as having
``The Greatest Snow on Earth,'' will host the men's and women's
giant slalom events, as well as snowboarding. For more information,
contact Park City Mountain Resort, P.O. Box 39, Park City, Utah
84060; (800) 222-PARK; www.parkcitymountain.com.
 &HT;    A few minutes away is Deer Valley, the most luxurious ski resort
in Utah, famed for its immaculate snow grooming, fine lodging and
good dining. Four Olympic alpine skiing events will be held here:
the men's and women's slaloms and combined slaloms.
 &HT;    The black-diamond run, called ``Know You Don't,'' will be the
site of the slalom races, while ``Big Stick'' is the choice for the
combined slalom.
 &HT;    Arguably the most exciting event in the Olympics will be held
here as well, the freestyle-skiing competitions of aerials and
moguls. For more information, contact Deer Valley Resort, P.O. Box
1525, Park City, Utah 84060; (800) 558-3337; www.deervalley.com.
 &HT;    Close to Park City is the Utah Winter Sports Park, a 387-acre
facility that will host the bobsleigh, luge, skeleton, ski jumping
and Nordic combined. The skeleton competition is aptly named, since
competitors board a narrow sled that is really just the frame of a
stripped-down bobsled. Riders go headfirst down the icy bobsleigh
track at close to 80 mph.
 &HT;    The 1,335-meter bobsleigh/luge track has five start areas and is
one of only 12 competition-certified ``refrigeration tracks'' in
the world.
 &HT;    In addition to watching American hopefuls practice on the
bobsleigh and luge, a singular highlight is watching others try out
skeleton, which has only twice before been an Olympic sport.
 &HT;    Better yet, amateur bobsleigh enthusiasts can take a ride on the
track. Two guests at a time can ride in a four-man bobsled,
accompanied by a driver and a brakeman. The cost is $125 per person
and reservations are required. Rides on a training device called a
Rocket are $27 per person.
 &HT;    Nordic ski jumping at the Utah Winter Sports Park is available
to the public, but the jumps are not the official Olympic jumps.
Instead, participants use the K-10 meter, K-20 meter and K-40 meter
ski jumps. These jumps are designed so that the jumper is never
more than two feet off the snow.
 &HT;    The Winter Sports Park claims that this is the only public
jumping facility in North America, if not the world. The cost is
$30 for adults, $20 for youths ages 13 to 17, and $15 for those
under age 12. The price includes instruction and a helmet. For more
information, contact the Utah Winter Sports Park, P.O. Box 980337,
Park City, Utah 84098; (435) 658-4200;
http://www.slc2002.org/sports/uwsp_frame.html.
 &HT;    Northwest of Park City, near the city of Ogden, the Snowbasin
Ski Area is the site of six Olympic events, including the men's and
women's downhill, combined downhill and super G races.
 &HT;    The men's downhill course was designed by Olympic Gold medalist
Bernard Russi. It has a vertical drop of 2,770 feet that is
expected to generate race speeds of more than 90 miles per hour.
 &HT;    Amateur skiers can enjoy the vertigo-inducing course at much
slower speeds, of course. And they can enjoy Snowbasin, one of the
great hidden secrets of Utah skiing.
 &HT;    While a new base area for the Olympic Games is being built, this
ski area still has an old-fashioned mom-and-pop feel to it. It's a
large, challenging and uncrowded mountain beloved by Ogden locals,
and the views that stretch into neighboring Nevada and Wyoming are
a bonus. For more information, contact Snowbasin, P.O. Box 460,
Huntsville, Utah 84317; (801) 399-1135; www.snowbasin.com).
 &HT;    For more information about wintertime fun in this part of the
country, contact Ski Utah, 150 West 500 South, Salt Lake City, Utah
84101; (800) 754-8824; www.skiutah.com.
 &HT;    For updates on the Olympic Games, contact the Salt Lake City
Organizing Committee, 257 East 200 South, Salt Lake City, Utah
84111; (801) 212-2002; www.slc2002.org.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In San Francisco, no person is an island, not
even a member of that smallest of local identity groups, persons of
Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   My conspiracy to undo George W. Bush by registering Republican
not only failed miserably on Tuesday, but I was outed as a fake
Republican in the worst of all possible places _ a gun store.
</P>
<P>
   I was in Marin County, the beautiful landscape God created to
hold up the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge, finding a gun
dealer so I could get a couple of my family's antique guns moved
from Massachusetts to California for use as decor statements to
stimulate conversation with Bambi huggers.
</P>
<P>
   A woman with a .25 caliber semiautomatic in her hand said, ``You
look familiar. Aren't you the Democratic columnist who became a
Republican to mess us up?''
</P>
<P>
   I did some fast talking, and she turned out to be a very nice
woman who politely gave me a lecture about my responsibilities as a
journalist and a citizen. She also told me how hard it is to be a
pro-gun Republican in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invite my Democratic neighbors to dinner, and pretty soon
they aren't talking,'' she said. ``So I just feed them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing. Most Republicans and most gun owners are
terrific people, but in San Francisco and surrounding counties
they're often treated like subhumans.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't often you'll find a columnist conceding he made
mistakes, but I shouldn't have joined a political party just to
throw a monkey wrench into its works.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not just saying that because there's a lady with a Colt
who knows what I look like.
</P>
<P>
   No person is an island, not even a guy who can write pretty much
whatever he wants down the length of a newspaper page.
</P>
<P>
   I gained nothing from abandoning my lifelong love-hate
relationship with the Democratic Party but a couple of cheap
columns and the ability to make conversation with my conservative
cousin Sally by telling her I'd registered Republican.
</P>
<P>
   She thought I'd finally matured, but I hadn't. I was just
playing games.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the primary in California is over, I feel like my
close-mouthed New England parents, who never would tell me who they
voted for, even though I knew perfectly well it wasn't Barry
Goldwater or Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   No, I won't say who I voted for, except he beat Bush in San
Francisco but lost nationally _ and before his near-concession
speech told Maria Shriver, the wife of the Terminator, to get out
of his way.
</P>
<P>
   In the island-nation of San Francisco, we love gutsy and
slightly crazy losing causes, but don't push me on why I voted for
such a conservative one.
</P>
<P>
   It was for all the wrong reasons, and it was time to get back to
the liberal fantasy island.
</P>
<P>
   There I was listening to the millions of therms of natural gas
released by politicians and pundits on CNN and MSNBC. San Francisco
Mayor Willie Brown was talking about how he's spent thousands on
his wardrobe, and Al Gore has outdone him with a lousy earth-tone
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   That's our island mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Republican analyst Mary Matalin was talking about independents
and Democrats who voted for McCain, and said, ``They weren't
crossovers. They were cross-dressers.''
</P>
<P>
   I assume this wasn't a homophobic joke, but a reference to
wolves in sheep drag. Still, her use of ``cross-dresser'' as a
negative word made me realize how different it is inside the
Beltway vs. inside the isle of Yerba Buena.
</P>
<P>
   I headed immediately for the ``victory party'' of the No on
Knight campaign, the group that organized to fight state Sen.
William ``Pete'' Knight's Proposition 22, which would forbid the
legal recognition of gay and lesbian marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The No on Knight campaign got its butt kicked, but that never
shut down a good victory party in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While Knight and his friends whooped it up in a Sacramento hotel
room, the Green Room at the War Memorial Building rocked with a DJ
playing Aretha Franklin and gay leaders giving some of the best
we-didn't-really-lose speeches I've ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   No on Knight chairman Mike Marshall and San Francisco Supervisor
Mark Leno both made the point that the pro-Knight people were
careful not to bash gays, but recognized their humanity _ all
except their human urge to marry.
</P>
<P>
   This represents progress since the blatantly gay-baiting Briggs
Initiative of 1978. As Leno told me, ``It's a whole new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is. Five potential San Francisco mayors _ Leno, Kevin
Shelley, Carole Migden, Tom Ammiano and Susan Leal _ circulated
through the party celebrating a campaign against the Knight
initiative that raised $6 million, brought positive attention to
gay families and won the endorsement of almost every newspaper in
California.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing surprising about politicians on this island
supporting gay causes. The TVs in the Green Room were what opened
my eyes. Before the returns came in, they were tuned to ``Will and
Grace,'' an NBC television show about gays and the straights who
love them.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me there would be such a sitcom without Harvey Milk. Yes,
San Francisco is an island, but like Great Britain its influence is
disproportionate to its size. And we're democrats who love our
monarchs.

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thank heavens they come but once a year and I
have to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge to get them. Otherwise,
I'd weigh 300 pounds and need semi-annual bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about frittelle. Six years ago, on a winter trip to
Venice, Italy, I encountered a pastry that affected me as no other
had.
</P>
<P>
   Not big on desserts, I rarely meet a cake, pie, tart or creme
brulee that tempts me past a couple of bites. But, as I confessed
in a 1995 travel piece:
</P>
<P>
   ``After my first frittelle, with marsala wine-laced zabaglione,
I realized I had at last found the foodstuff that could kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Frittelle are lime-sized lumps of cream puff dough (eggs, flour,
water, butter, sugar) that are pastry piped into hot peanut or
canola oil and quickly deep-fried (about three minutes to a side).
</P>
<P>
   Three times bigger after they cook, the frittelle are allowed to
cool, then infused with zabaglione or fruit filling and dusted with
powdered or granulated sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Some people describe them as ultra-light donuts without holes.
All I know is, after I ate that first one, I walked around Venice
for a week consuming frittelle as if they were breath mints. It was
scary.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, in the ensuing years, two things have worked in
favor of me keeping my arteries open and my dress size an 8.
</P>
<P>
   1. Frittelle are strictly seasonal. They're made only during the
weeks that separate the Feast of the Epiphany in early January from
the commencement of Lent on Ash Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   2. I couldn't find them anywhere outside of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, life changed.
</P>
<P>
   A friend phoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell for sure because they were closed, but it
looks like they have frittelle in Emporio Rulli,'' he said. ``I
thought you'd want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as soon as I could get away from my office, I
drove over the bridge to Larkspur. I've always liked Rulli because
it looks and smells exactly like an elegant, old Italian
pasticceria _ all polished dark wood, brass, gold-lettered plate
glass and marble.
</P>
<P>
   It looks this way because its owner, Gary Rulli, has imported
every piece of the place from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-born, Rulli picked up the ABCs of Italian baking
in the early 1980s at the legendary Victoria Pastry Co., in North
Beach. Then he moved to Italy for a few years and got really
serious. Each year he returns to find out what's new and to
continue to learn from the aging pastry masters.
</P>
<P>
   With three staff bakers, Rulli produces dozens of traditional
Italian pastries, such as ventaglia and budino di riso, each day.
Dedicated to authenticity, he also turns out specialties, such as
pannini della quaresima (Easter hot-cross buns) and chocolate,
walnut and raisin pannetone _ paradiso _ at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in and say, `These are fantastic! Why don't you
make them all year-round?' But that would ruin it,'' Rulli said.
``I think the seasonal aspect makes it more interesting and fun,
something you look forward to. If we made them all year-round, they
wouldn't be special anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it was frittelle we were talking about, I would have to
sell my house and move to the only shelter I'd fit in: a dirigible
hangar.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, what my friend saw through the window of Rulli
was not frittelle, but its chunkier cousin, bomboloni. Also a
pre-Lent specialty, bomboloni look just like frittelle but are made
with denser brioche dough. The result _ at Rulli anyway _ is the
lightest, airiest jelly or custard donut you could ever imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it ain't frittelle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're describing sounds like zeppole,'' said Rulli. ``We
make those for the Feast of St. Joseph on March 19. But they're
much smaller. Bite-sized.''
</P>
<P>
   No, I told him, frittelle are hand-sized. Believe me.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Rulli told me he'd talked to a Venetian pastry
chef about my quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was right. They are like zeppole, fried cream puff dough,''
he said. ``In Milan, they make them small and call them zeppole.
But in Venice, they make them very large and call them frittelle.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Rulli made the hair stand up all over my head and neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I decided I'm going to make up some frittelle on the last
day before Ash Wednesday,'' he said. ``If you want, I'll save you
some.''
</P>
<P>
   God help me. I'll be there when you open, Gary. Meanwhile,
somebody get the dirigible hangar ready.

&HT;     LESSONS FOR MANAGERS FROM `THE WEST WING' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There was a great scene in ``The West Wing''
television program a few weeks ago that a lot of bosses could have
learned from. The president was about to give the State of the
Union address, but the secretary of agriculture had to be left
behind at the White House so that someone from the presidential
line of succession would survive if the Capitol blew up.
</P>
<P>
   On the slight chance that something would go wrong, the
president told the secretary how to handle national security, and
that one of the toilets in the residence needs to be jiggled every
once in a while. They also had this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a best friend?'' the president asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' the secretary replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he smarter than you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you trust him with your life?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your chief of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with that picture? Not a thing _ except that too
many bosses will be oblivious to it.
</P>
<P>
   The scene offers several lessons: A few things can be handled
only by the boss. Just as the president has to have a strong hand
in national security, some life-and-death items in business can be
handled only by the chief executive. But often bosses get so caught
up in the day-to-day frenzy that they don't stop to think about how
they are performing a lot of mundane tasks that ought to be
delegated.
</P>
<P>
   The other danger is that they have become such perfectionists
that they can't let go of anything. If you delegate, certainly your
subordinates might not handle tasks as well as you would. But you
can teach them how to do better, and then have time to concentrate
on the important parts of your job. If you never delegate, nothing
will ever improve.
</P>
<P>
   You got a best friend? One of the first things a boss needs to
do is hire a reliable second in command, or at least make sure
you're happy with whoever already holds the job. At work, that
person will be your best friend, even if you never see each other
socially.
</P>
<P>
   Should he really be your best friend? Probably not. Too many
people will think he was appointed because of that rather than
because of talent. Besides, having a best friend away from your
office might at least give you some chance of balancing your work
with the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   But your second in command should at least be worthy of being
your friend. That doesn't mean you have to have a lot in common or
laugh at the same jokes, but he ought to be someone you like and
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Do other people seem to respect him? Do you? Would you be
embarrassed to have him represent you at an important meeting?
Would you trust him with your kids? If you don't like the answers
to any of those questions, you have the wrong person.
</P>
<P>
   Is he smarter than you? He ought to be, at least in some ways.
Even if you're a member of Mensa, you can find someone who's
smarter than you in many aspects of the job. Maybe he has better
people skills or is more organized or doesn't get as frazzled under
pressure as you do. Maybe he's more creative or more pragmatic or
better at seeing things as other people see them.
</P>
<P>
   Business guru Tom Peters says that if you are a chief executive
and your chief operating officer and your chief financial officer
agree on everything, you should fire one of them. They ought to be
seeing things from different perspectives because their jobs are so
different. If they always agree, one of them is superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   If you and your second in command always agree, you have the
wrong person. You have someone who is either dumber than you or
afraid to disagree with you. In either case, he's the wrong person
_ or you're the wrong boss.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're afraid to go outside your comfort zone. Are you
interviewing candidates from the opposite sex and different
ethnicities? Have you considered people whose backgrounds are far
different than yours? Do you encourage creativity or discourage it?
Remember: You're looking for someone to complement you, not a
clone.
</P>
<P>
   If you still can't find anyone, build a bigger office. You'll
need it for your ego.
</P>
<P>
   Would you trust him with your life? Maybe that's a bit
melodramatic, but you do have to trust your second in command in
two crucial ways: decision-making and back-stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Except for earth-shattering matters, you have to let your second
in command make a lot of decisions or you'll make yourself crazy.
If he has to ask your permission before blowing his nose, something
is seriously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Explain what you consider before making decisions and make sure
he understands your goals and concerns. Then let him handle a lot
of the minor things, and gradually move up to more major decisions.
</P>
<P>
   You won't always agree with everything that he does, but that's
all right. If he's following the ``wrong'' path, find out why.
Maybe he has a better strategy than you do. If not, gently correct
him.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken cause of a lot of weak hiring is a boss's own
insecurity. If I hire a relative incompetent, the thinking goes,
I'll just appear even more useful to my own boss. When layoffs
come, I'll be safe.
</P>
<P>
   That might be true, but you'll also ensure that you never reach
your full potential. People who operate weak departments rarely get
promoted (except by insecure bosses, of course), and you will never
really be able to get away from the office because you know that
you've left an incompetent in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Trust works both ways, of course. Your second in command has to
trust that you will support him, even in tough times, and help him
achieve whatever career goals he has.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, you have to jiggle the toilet yourself. Your
second in command is not a flunky. Give him enough choice
assignments to keep him interested, and do a few mundane tasks on
your own to keep yourself humble.
</P>
<P>
   If you do it well enough, who knows? Someday you might be
president.

   GLAND, SWITZERLAND _ Water is the most basic of elements upon
which life depends, yet we seem to understand little about it.
</P>
<P>
   There is a developing water crisis in many parts of the world.
Increased flooding and droughts are a symptom. But do the technical
experts and the politicians understand where the solution really
lies?
</P>
<P>
   The world's increasing difficulties in managing its supplies of
fresh water cannot be tackled without a thorough understanding of
the complete water cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The problems must be seen in the context of the falls in
underground water levels in much of the world, and of catastrophic
droughts in some regions while others, such as Mozambique, suffer
catastrophic flooding.
</P>
<P>
   What prompts these thoughts is the forthcoming Global Water
Forum at The Hague from March 17 to 22.
</P>
<P>
   It will bring together thousands of experts, politicians and
representatives of nongovernmental organizations to address the
global freshwater crisis.
</P>
<P>
   My fear is that, without serious analysis of the fundamental
causes of the problem, this worthy conference will be reduced to
considering the sort of unsustainable technological solutions that
we have seen in the past.
</P>
<P>
   How long are we to go on ignoring the simple fact that the main
cause of the crisis is degradation of the natural environment, and
particularly the water cycle?
</P>
<P>
   All over the world, water-storing ponds, lakes and wetlands have
been reclaimed, depleting water sources and vastly increasing the
risk of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, deforestation and the diversion of rivers have
severely restricted the natural capacity of the landscape to retain
rainfall and refill underground water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   We affect the water cycle by discharging pollutants both
directly into aquatic ecosystems and on the land, from where they
leach into waterways.
</P>
<P>
   We have released sufficient quantities of greenhouse gases into
the atmosphere to change the climate of the entire planet,
seriously threatening wetlands and altering weather patterns so
that more floods and droughts can be expected in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of the world's 6 billion people have
no access to safe drinking water, while almost half lack adequate
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the human suffering caused, this is appalling. But
the full implications are much wider: Degradation of water
resources is the main barrier preventing the world from achieving
shared goals of good public health, security of food supplies and a
better standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to solve the water crisis is to stop assuming that
we are competing with nature and welcome natural systems as our
ally.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in India, where water tables have been falling
rapidly, we can see how restoration of ecosystems and watersheds
goes hand in hand with efficient harvesting of rainwater.
Underground water sources are refilled and can continue to meet the
basic needs of many people.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, studies show that the energy needs that will
accompany expected economic growth can be served without recourse
to large dams or nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Concentration on energy efficiency and renewable sources not
only makes economic sense but also represents perhaps our best hope
of tackling the causes of climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Conserving and restoring natural processes pays off. The U.S.
government has embarked on a program to restore the ecosystems of
the Florida Everglades to ensure water supplies for growing
populations in Miami and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pity that the degradation has reached such a stage that
taxpayers are obliged to meet a bill of $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient times, water resources were recognized and respected
in both practical and spiritual terms. It is time to remember the
lessons of our forebears and change our behavior to protect our
sources of water and the natural processes that create them.
</P>
<P>
   They are ultimately life support systems on which we depend. &QL;

 By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's over.
 &HT;    Back in 1948, Missouri's favorite son confounded the pundits and
won the presidency in the face of discouraging polls. But in 2000,
another son of Missouri couldn't even carry the Show-Me State in
his own party's primary.
 &HT;    In short, Bill Bradley is no Harry Truman.
 &HT;    So how did the past year turn Bradley from the Democratic
Party's champion-in-waiting into a Super Tuesday also-ran?
 &HT;    Almost exactly a year ago, I watched Bradley wow 1,200 people at
Fordham Law School's annual alumni luncheon. It was the event's
biggest turnout since a speech by John F. Kennedy, and the audience
_ predominantly Catholic, heavily Republican but including many
``Reagan Democrats'' _ could not have been warmer.
 &HT;    At the time, it struck me as a coming-out party for a man who
might very well be president.
 &HT;    Bradley's first year with the New York Knicks didn't go well.
Labeled the team's ``great white hope,'' the former Princeton star
at first crumbled under the pressure of NBA play. The fans were
furious _ in New York, we take our sports and our politics
seriously _ and Bradley was stunned when fans threw coins at him,
and one even spat on him.
 &HT;    Needless to say, over time his play improved. He won over the
fans and earned a spot in basketball's Hall of Fame.
 &HT;    But presidential politics doesn't allow much time to grow. After
a year at least as frustrating as that first NBA season, the former
New Jersey senator is packing his bags and heading home.
 &HT;    What went wrong? Iowa and New Hampshire _ or, to put it another
way, organization and John McCain.
 &HT;    It's hard to get to the caucuses during an Iowa winter,
especially if the weather is bad. Television ads won't bring people
out. It takes friends calling friends, it takes a campaign
providing transportation for the elderly and disabled, it takes
prodding and pushing _ in other words, it takes organization.
 &HT;    Al Gore has spent the last 25 years making political friends,
and it paid off in Iowa, as the Democratic Party apparatus and
organized labor came through for him. After spending $2 million and
countless hours wooing Iowa voters, Bradley came in a distant
second.
 &HT;    New Hampshire, Bradley figured, would be better. In a primary
that allowed non-Democrats to vote, he could draw on
independent-minded Republicans who would respond to his fresh
ideas, demonstrating to the Democrats that he had the kind of
broad-based appeal to win in November.
 &HT;    But John McCain got there first, and those independents _ and
even some reform-minded Democrats, Bradley's natural base _ flocked
to the Arizonan's bandwagon. Bradley trailed Gore only narrowly,
but that wasn't nearly good enough.
 &HT;    The ship had sailed. For the next four weeks, every McCain win
garnered him more press attention, while Bradley's candidacy
withered on the vine. By last weekend, analysts were writing
Bradley's political obituary, marveling at the resiliency that let
him keep fighting even though tracking polls showed him losing by
bigger numbers each day.
 &HT;    Personally, I wasn't surprised. Bradley was a pro, and pros
don't quit. They know that anything can happen _ just ask Harry
Truman.
 &HT;    Besides, Bradley had to hang in until Super Tuesday at least. He
owed it to his supporters, if not to himself.
 &HT;    In May 1998 I left the New York State Democratic Convention
after securing a place on the ballot for the U.S. Senate race, but
I was devastated. Everything that could go wrong was going wrong,
and I soon became convinced that getting into the race in the first
place had been a mistake.
 &HT;    When I talked it over with my husband, he had a simple reaction:
``So quit.''
 &HT;    I couldn't. What could I tell my campaign staff? What kind of an
example would I be if, when things get tough, I bailed out? What
about the political people who went with me rather than one of my
opponents _ could I hang them out to dry? What about the thousands
of people who gave money to the campaign?
 &HT;    It's easy to say ``quit,'' but it isn't that easy to do it.
 &HT;    I like Al Gore, but after that law-school luncheon I was
convinced that Bradley was the Democrats' only hope of retaining
the White House.
 &HT;    I don't feel that way now. I think Gore has a good shot at
winning _ and, if he does, part of the credit will be due to Bill
Bradley.
 &HT;    Without Bradley's early success in fund-raising and in the
polls, would Gore have carried out the shakeup which has so
invigorated his campaign? Would he have had the motivation to
campaign as vigorously as he has, on television and in person?
Would the Democratic Party and organized labor be coming into the
fall with their political machines oiled up and ready for a
showdown?
 &HT;    No, Bill Bradley isn't Harry Truman. And he isn't a winner _ but
that doesn't make him a loser.

A GAUDI MASTERPIECE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Antoni Gaudi's grandest dream _ a temple of faith that
wasn't finished in his lifetime and may not be finished in ours.
</P>
<P>
   Gaudi, the architect whose curvy, modernistic buildings give
Barcelona its distinctive look, planned a glorious cathedral in
that city, with heavily decorated spires shooting heavenward, and
three facades, representing faith, hope, and charity. Each facade
would have four towers, collectively representing the 12 Apostles.
And there would be a central dome, soaring some 500 feet high. The
name: Temple Expiatori de La Sagrada Familia (Exploratory Temple of
the Holy Family).
</P>
<P>
   The building was begun in 1882 but Gaudi got involved in 1891
and radically transformed the design. When he died in 1926 after
being struck by a trolley, most of only one facade was finished.
Construction began again intermittently in 1940, and today _ more
than a century after it was started _ La Sagrada Familia is perhaps
half-finished.
</P>
<P>
   That half offers much to see, however, with its brilliantly
colored tiles and mosaics, and sculpted art resembling balloons and
pinwheels. Some people are content to just gaze at the surreal
exterior, but most visit the interior of this wondrous
work-in-progress and the museum there that tells the story of La
Sagrada Familia. There is an admission charge, and an additional
fee to ride an elevator to the spires for spectacular views. (We
took the elevator up, then walked down the dark, winding, seemingly
endless staircase. It was eerie.)
</P>
<P>
   The work, and the controversy over the design and some of the
sculptures, goes on. Today's workers, though, have an advantage
over those who labored in Gaudi's time: computer-guided saws that
can chisel a granite column in one-sixth the time it takes by hand.
</P>
<P>
   (Barcelona, Spain's second-largest city, offers a lot more to
see than La Sagrada Familia. We enjoyed our visit immensely, even
if a cab driver did overcharge us on our return to the airport. For
more information on Barcelona and all of Spain, call the Spanish

   CALGARY, Alberta _ Few places in North America could be as
different from Boston _ physically, culturally, and geographically
_ as the place in which Ray Bourque found himself, inside the gates
of Stampede Park and in the visitors' locker room at the
Saddledome.
</P>
<P>
   But Bourque, wearing 77 on his back _ a strange 77, in maroon
and blue _ found himself here, on the ice for the opening faceoff
between his new team, the Colorado Avalanche, and the Calgary
Flames.
</P>
<P>
   He was paired on defense with Adam Foote, to provide stability,
the outlet pass, and so much more for a team lacking in leadership.
Not even a slight groin strain that took him out of the game in the
third period dampened the enthusiasm felt by all the Avalanche on
this day. The fact that Colorado won, 8-3, didn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   As Foote put it, ``What Ray does on the ice is not as important
as what he'll do in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque seemed excited, even wired, upon arriving in Calgary
after the long flight from Boston. He said he still wants to see if
he has ``it'' _ that intangible ``it'' that made him a great
defenseman but lately has been doubted. Perhaps even by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There (are) two reasons why I asked to be traded,'' said
Bourque, who was whisked from the airport to an immediate press
conference at a downtown hotel. ``One is obvious; I've never won a
Stanley Cup. I asked to go to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second reason is, at this point in my career, I need a
challenge. I really want to find out what's left in Ray Bourque. A
challenge like this is really going to bring out the best in me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional morning for Bourque's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They drove me to the airport this morning, and it was very
tough,'' said Bourque. ``But they're with me 100 percent. My
children know this is going to be a good thing for their dad, and
my wife is behind me 100 percent. The children know Dad's going for
what he always wanted to play for.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Andreychuk, the other part of the Boston-to-Colorado
package, confirmed that it was emotional for Dad, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane ride was long and we had a great chance to talk,''
said Andreychuk. ``This is Ray's first move to another team so, of
course, I told him what to look for. But Ray was nervous _ he was
really nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was so nervous, so pumped up before the game ``that I
went too hard, too quick in the warmups,'' and slightly hurt his
groin, which put him on the bench for the third period. ``I didn't
want to aggravate it, so we kind of backed off.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole day was surreal, with Bourque ``having thoughts all
day long'' of former teammates such as Don Sweeney and Steve
Heinze, ``and I'm sure I will have thoughts for many days to come.
I'll never forget the guys I played with.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the new teammates who welcomed him right away was former
Bruin Dave Reid, who gave him a hug and told him, ``The hardest
thing for you will be the warmups; you've run them in Boston for 21
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque conceded that the warmups were weird, but he was
surprised at how comfortable he felt in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be very tough,'' he said. ``But it
was real nice getting off to the start we did and winning like we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that ``77'' in maroon and blue hanging in his locker was
weird, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then you just put it on and go out there,'' he said.
``Skating around in the warmups with it on was weird. But then the
game started and we began clicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bourque showed a side of himself that the Boston media
rarely saw. He was psyched, and he said so. ``Coming to Colorado,
I'm psyched,'' he said. ``I'm thrilled and excited to be coming
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting dressed for those last games in Boston, it was a very
emotional time. That was real tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Bruins' sorry plight, Bourque would say only, ``We know
how Harry (Sinden) runs his business. He's consistent; you've got
to give him that. It's no surprise to anybody. Harry has always
gone about his business the same way and we all know it, so . . .
you live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk also was forthright, saying, ``No matter what people
tell you, money doesn't buy happiness. You can read that 19
different ways, but Ray stayed there because he was treated very,
very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say Harry didn't treat his players well? Bull. The
Boston Bruins were very good for Ray Bourque and he was good for
the team. It works both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   And Andreychuk went to work right away, stealing the puck and
feeding Adam Deadmarsh for a goal that gave the Avalanche a 2-1
lead. An errant pass by Bourque helped set up Calgary's second
goal, but Bourque picked up a point _ his first in the NHL that
didn't come as a Bruin _ with a typically nifty pass from his end
that sent Milan Hejduk and Alex Tanguay out on a break. Hejduk
finished the play for Colorado's sixth goal, at 11:40 of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bourque sat out the third period, he will play in
Colorado's next game on this Alberta tour, Friday night in
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Avalanche captain Joe Sakic said he would give up the
``C'' on his sweater if Bourque asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can comes in and asks for it, he can have it,'' said
Sakic.
</P>
<P>
   But will he? Sakic was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't.''

   ``Monk's Dream''
</P>

   Steve Lacy/Roswell Rudd.

<P>
   JAZZ/Verve. 9 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy and
trombonist Roswell Rudd formed the core of a pianoless quartet that
played, almost exclusively, the complete works of Thelonious Monk.
The birth of the concept of a jazz repertory was still many years
distant, and the idea of an ensemble devoting itself to a single
composer _ in particular, to a colleague not universally
appreciated at the time _ resembled some insane spiritual exercise.
Monk's compo-
</P>
<P>
   sitions have, however, endured spectacularly, and the Lacy/Rudd
quartet, dissolved in 1965, became one of those mythic jazz
touchstones, like Paul Gonsalves' 27 choruses at the 1956 Newport
Jazz Festival. That only one obscure recording documented the
Lacy/Rudd band helped enlarge the legend. But Lacy and Rudd
reunited recently in the studio, with excellent support from
Jean-Jacques Avenel on bass and John Betsch on drums, to reminisce
about the time 30 years ago when they were Thelonious' monks.
</P>
<P>
   Only two selections on the resulting compact disc are by Monk,
but the missing pianist's spirit of economy informs the whole disc.
The delicate, precise and always tuneful Lacy finds his
counterweight in Rudd's burlesque glissandos, jungle growls and
earthy good humor. The two vocals provided by Lacy's significant
other, Irene Aebi, are not to my taste, but there are many
redeeming moments, including the prancing hip shaking of ``The
Rent'' and the sublime ``Pannonica.''

<P>
   Eric Carmen is one of those pop stars whose image is so
ambiguous that it doesn't really stick in the mind, yet he somehow
manages to have a hook-laden smash radio hit every decade. In the
1970s, it was the lusty makeout classic ``Go All the Way'' (with
power pop group the Raspberries) and the solo weepie ``All by
Myself.'' Ten years later, he emerged from the polyester years with
the 1987 groin-grind single ``Hungry Eyes,'' from the
million-selling soundtrack to ``Dirty Dancing.'' Now, just as the
'90s fade away without a peep from Carmen, here he comes with an
album of new material, angling for a hit. This time out, however,
the 50-year-old singer may not score a comeback. Gone are the
anguished, McCartney-eseque screams and the buoyant pop tunes with
hypnotic melodies. Carmen, for the most part, has become Celine
Dion, with an album of mostly overwritten ballads and vocals laced
with exaggerated emotion.

<P>
   Just when we thought one of the hard-core rap groups was calling
it quits, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony creatively splices together another
album that blatantly puts to death the rumors and resurrects its
authentic sound. Lyrically, the Grammy-winning group has combined
its most unapologetic poetry and life experiences, rendering a list
of tracks that negatively influences (``Ecstasy''), positively
inspires (``Change the World'') and forcefully paints a vivid
description of their world (``Mind on Our Money''). Although the
songs are contradictory at times _ rapping about changing the world
in one and then glamorizing drugs in another _ the album is
consistent musically, with an appealing R&AMP;B sound.

AN ENDURING LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The joke was that Ray Bourque would be the only Bruin
to have his jersey retired while he was still wearing it. Harry
Sinden, who goes back to the days of the NHL's Original Six, said
he couldn't remember the team without Bourque on it. Twenty-one
years, 1,518 games, nearly 50,000 minutes. More than twice as many
as Bobby Orr, the legend he conceded he could never be.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was hockey's Ripken, its Gehrig, its Havlicek, his
attendance as remarkable as his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a guy who shows up every night to play,'' Bourque said.
</P>
<P>
   He never missed more than 20 games in a season, and four times
he played in them all. He played with sprained knees, wrenched
shoulders, charley horses, bruised ribs, hip pointers, pulled back
muscles, broken fingers, and scratched eyeballs. This year, a
deflected slapshot tore open his upper lip and gums and knocked out
three teeth. Bourque nonchalantly showed up the next morning for
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was always a blue-collar player, the fourth of five
children of a maintenance man who lived in a working-class Montreal
suburb. His father put him on skates when he was 3 and stuck a
hockey net against a basement wall in their apartment house for
Bourque and his brothers to fire at.
</P>
<P>
   By 14, he was off to juniors, to Three Rivers, to Sorel, to
Verdun. ``We got us a champion here,'' said Sinden when he saw
Bourque in an all-star tournament, and he drafted Bourque first in
1979. Bourque was just 18, yet Sinden admitted to having goose
bumps the first time he saw him in camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who'd just missed making the Stanley Cup finals by
one game, were loaded with veterans that year, but they knew that
the quiet Quebecois would eventually be the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just play hockey,'' enforcer John Wensink told him, ``and if
anybody touches you, I'll be right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque set up a goal on his first shift and played 94 straight
games before Detroit goon Dennis Polonich broke his jaw in two
places with an overhand right. But Bourque made a point of winning
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give an inch,'' he would say, two decades later.
``If you do, then they've got the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque came to play every shift, every night. His greatest fear
other than horror movies (he woke up screaming after watching
``Terminator 2'') was doing something wrong on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid to make a mistake,'' he once said. ``Afraid to be
embarrassed out there, afraid that I won't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear drove Bourque to stardom immediately. He was the first
non-goalie to win the Calder Trophy (top rookie) and make
first-team All-Star in the same season. After three seasons, Sinden
was calling him ``one of our top, top players.'' After half a
dozen, he was considered the best all-around defenseman in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   When rival clubs asked about trading for Bourque (and most knew
better), Sinden would say he wasn't available. Not unless you could
guarantee him a Stanley Cup. The Bruins had a taste of it in 1988,
when they finally ended the Canadiens playoff jinx after 45 years,
beat the Devils in seven games, and got to the finals against the
Oilers for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   They were back two years later, and it was Bourque who got them
there, miraculously coming out for the seventh game in the opening
series against Hartford after missing the previous four with a deep
hip bruise.
</P>
<P>
   At noon that day, he couldn't skate. That evening, Bourque led
his club onto the Garden ice and played the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked at the way he played,'' marveled Mike Milbury,
then his fellow blue liner. ``This is big-league hockey. I don't
know how he got through it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opening game of the finals against the Oilers, Bourque
brought his mates back from the dead with two third-period goals
and kept them going through three overtimes and 115 minutes (he
played nearly 59) before they lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt this was the year,'' he said after Edmonton had wiped
out the Bruins in five. ``Another chance? I hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   That was what kept Bourque in Boston, the thought of hoisting
the Auld Mug aloft and skating in triumphant circles with the men
who'd elected him captain. He would never be Orr (``a
once-in-a-lifetime player''), but Orr had never been captain.
</P>
<P>
   His mates saw the leadership in him before Bourque did himself.
It was his work ethic, his dedication, his loyalty, his grit, his
resilience, his humility, his balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life is in order,'' Kyle McLaren said.
</P>
<P>
   When Bourque was at his locker (and when wasn't he?), there was
a comforting sense of stability, of reliability, of harmony, of
camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to let that guy down,'' Don Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's longevity, his sheer everydayness, conferred authority
on him, as it had on Ripken, on Gehrig, on Havlicek, on the iron
horses of every sport. He had been blessed with a hockey player's
body, Bourque observed. Thick, sturdy frame. Natural strength.
Superb cardiovascular system. ``He really is a horse,'' Sinden
observed.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was a year-round horse, working himself hard over the
summers, following a day-by-day program laid out by his old high
school gym teacher Benoit Leduc, who coached Canada's distance
runners for years. During the season, Bourque rarely took days off,
even when practices were optional and he was hurting. ``Touching
the ice'' kept him in rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Bourque in uniform, day after day, year after year, made
it easy to take him and his exceptional skills for granted. It took
him eight years to win the first of his five Norris Trophies as the
league's best defensemen. He never won the Hart, which goes to the
MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque didn't even rule his own town. Larry Bird, who arrived
the same year (``Who's Larry Bird?,'' Bourque wondered) and played
for championship Celtic teams, did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Bourque has never gotten his due in this town,'' Sinden
said time and again, ``and he probably never will.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque didn't even get to keep his own number. The 7 belonged
to Phil Esposito (``I never asked for it,'' Bourque insisted), and
Bourque gladly gave it up when Esposito came back to see it hoisted
to the rafters in 1987. ``It's all yours,'' Bourque told him.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque would wear 77, would wear it as long as it took to bring
the Cup back to Causeway Street. ``I think I'll go forever,'' he
mused puckishly at 31, but he already sensed the clock ticking.
</P>
<P>
   That year, he mistakenly walked into the old-timers' dressing
room at the All-Star Game and saw Guy Lafleur and Darryl Sittler
and Denis Potvin. ``I've played against almost every guy in
there,'' Bourque realized.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he knew, longevity would become as much a vice as a
virtue. When he hit a rough patch in 1993, Bourque began hearing
that he was trade bait, that he was on the downslide. ``I'm not too
old to be playing this game,'' he told himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was still logging 30 minutes a night, still playing all
but a handful of games a season, still making first-team All-Star.
He still had another Norris Trophy in him. He had everything but a
serious shot at the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were becoming postseason patsies, one-and-out. In
1997, they missed the playoffs for the first time in 30 years. For
an ebullient couple of weeks last season, after he and his mates
ground down Carolina (with Bourque playing 53 minutes in the
pivotal double-overtime victory in Game 5), Bourque thought there
might be a chance.
</P>
<P>
   It was, finally, a false spring and Bourque's last one here. He
had hinted, then stated, that this campaign might be his last. When
the season unraveled in a sour mix of losses and injuries and
mayhem and pointed fingers, it became inevitable. So the captain
asked for the puck after Saturday's game with the Flyers and
essentially bade his blood brethren adieu.
</P>
<P>
   He has outlasted three presidents, 10 coaches, and 15 buildings.
Now, Raymond Jean Bourque goes to the Rocky Mountains to play in a
rink named after a soft drink for the young generation. The next
time he comes to the FleetCenter, he goes to the rafters.

 &HT;    Steely Dan's sound as polished as ever
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's just like they never left.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after releasing their apparent swan song,
``Gaucho,'' Donald Fagen and Walter Becker are back with a new
studio album that seamlessly picks up where the Steely Dan duo left
off in 1979. And here's the surprise: ``Two Against Nature'' trumps
``Gaucho'' on many fronts and, in places, approaches the sweep and
scope of the Dan's 1977 masterwork, ``Aja.''
</P>
<P>
   From the opening strains of the effervescent ``Gaslighting
Abbie,'' it's clear that the trademark Fagen-Becker blend of
goes-down-easy pop, jazz and soul is still kicking. Other Dan
hallmarks are also evident: the top-notch musicianship, clean
production and cynical perspectives on oddball relationships and
urban weirdos. Yet somehow ``Nature'' sounds fresh and new _
perhaps because it contrasts so starkly with the schmaltzy noodling
that passes for so much smooth jazz today.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons to Steely Dan's best works are inevitable. And while
``Nature'' doesn't surpass such masterpieces as ``The Royal Scam''
or ``Pretzel Logic,'' most tracks sound like box-set-worthy
outtakes from ``Aja'' _ they're that good. The standouts ``Almost
Gothic'' and ``Cousin Dupree'' cultivate irresistible in-the-pocket
grooves that rank with the best of the Dan catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature'' probably won't displace any longtime Dan favorites.
But if you liked them before, you'll go for this, too.

 &HT;    `Truth' be told, solo debut falls short of buzz
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, here's ``The Truth'' about Beanie Sigel's debut: Nothing on
it lives up to the hype that came before it.
</P>
<P>
   Here he was, a guy who'd made a memorable guest appearance on
``1000 Bars'' from DJ Clue's mix tape and the remix of Jay-Z's
single ``Money, Cash, (Expletive)''. That was it. Then _ as hip-hop
lore goes _ though he hadn't made a demo and wasn't even thinking
about leaving an admitted life of crime in Philadelphia for rap,
the record industry comes after him. Next thing you know, Sigel's
on Jay-Z's label and at Jay-Z's side in 1998 as he rode his 4
million-selling ``Hard Knock Life'' album to a Grammy and the
best-selling rap road show in history.
</P>
<P>
   For the encore, ``Life and Times of S. Carter,'' Jay-Z hands the
mike to Sigel on its first single, ``Do It Again.'' And his dynamic
lead verse only heightens the buzz. Granted, the momentum is
maintained by both muscular (``The Truth,'' ``Who Want What'') and
spare (``Raw &AMP; Uncut'') blaxploitation-inspired production, and his
menacing delivery always draws you in. But when it comes to subject
matter, it's like Sigel was never plucked off the streets because
the only truth he can talk about is that.

   The late Stanley Kubrick's final film is a letdown _ an often

confronts a rich New York couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman).
</P>
<P>
   When she confesses to lustful feelings for a stranger, he
embarks on a tentative sexual quest, testing his marriage. And our
patience. While it has its moments, its much-touted centerpiece
orgy doesn't work. What you get resembles Cirque du Soleil as

Dutch touch is about all that distinguishes this adaptation of a
19th-century children's book about an orphan boy who befriends the

   &QR;  ``Windhorse'' (unrated) _ Shot guerrilla-style on a digital
camera, this political drama focuses on a Tibetan brother and
sister facing oppression from the Chinese police. Considering the
ingenuity and personal risk that went into the (illegal) making of
the movie, it's a shame it isn't a little sharper. Too often, you
find yourself wishing for a script as strong as the convictions of

   &QR;  ``The King of Masks'' (unrated) _ A charming fable about the
growing bond between a street performer and his adopted child. It's
also a good treatise on the treatment of females in 1930s China.
Though it suffers some lapses of sentimentality and melodrama, it's
held together by its emotional core. In Mandarin with subtitles.

<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Braciole
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 to 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: about 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 1-1 1/2 hours
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds flank steak, cut and pounded into thin slices about
4 by 6 inches (see note)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup minced fresh parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 cups basic marinara sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 pound favorite pasta, cooked according to package directions
</P>
<P>
   Note: We found the easiest way to do this is to cut steak into
six pieces, then butterfly them by cutting horizontally almost all
the way through, and pounding lightly to a uniform thickness. This
works best when meat is semifrozen.
</P>
<P>
   Season the meat on both sides with salt and pepper to taste. In
a bowl, combine the 1/2 cup Parmesan, garlic and parsley. Divide
the mixture among the meat slices, spreading it into an even layer,
and roll up each slice from short end to short end to enclose the
filling. Secure each roll with string or toothpicks. In a casserole
or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm oil. When hot, add meat
rolls and cook, turning, until browned on all sides, about 5 to 7
minutes. Add marinara sauce, bring to a boil, reduce heat enough to
maintain a simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, for 1
to 1 1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer meat to a platter and remove the strings or toothpicks.
Return meat to sauce and simmer until heated through. Serve with
pasta and freshly grated Parmesan. _ From: ``The Men of the Pacific
Street Social Club Cook Italian'' by Gerard Renny (WilliamMorrow,
$23)

 &HT;    Dish featured on TV sitcom prompts queries
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the Feb. 28 episode of the popular CBS sitcom ``Everybody
Loves Raymond,'' the food department has fielded numerous inquiries
from readers about the guest star: the Italian specialty braciole.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, Ray's wife, Debra, makes fabulous braciole, which
everyone in the family raves about. Everybody, that is, but Ray's
mother, Marie, who deemed Debra's masterpiece a direct threat to
her self-proclaimed superiority in the kitchen and her role as
alpha-female in the dysfunctional but loving Romano clan.
</P>
<P>
   So what is braciole (pronounced bra-ZHOLE)? Basically, it's
sliced beef or veal that's pounded thin and then stuffed, rolled
and tied with string like a jellyroll. The rolls are then seared in
olive oil and put in a pot of gravy or sauce to simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Braciole is definitely a Sunday dish. There is no such thing as
quick 'n' easy braciole. My mother, Josephine, let her braciole
simmer in a huge pot of gravy for a couple of days, along with
meatballs, sausage, lamb and whatever else she put in that fabulous
pot. By Sunday, the braciole was fork-tender and meltingly
flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   Braciole is served all over the boot of Italy and has hundreds
of variations according to the region or even a particular family.
Particularly threatening to Marie Romano were the raisins Debra
used in hers. ``She used raisins?'' asks the astonished Marie.
Along with the fundamental ingredients of garlic, parsley and bread
crumbs, the stuffing might also include pine nuts, sausage, various
cheeses, olives, mushrooms, hard-boiled eggs (from southern Italy),
eggplantor prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, we give you a basic braciole recipe, along with some Web
sites with recipes for those who are more ambitious.

 &HT;    Some devilishly good movies to check out
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles may be the City of Angels, but Hollywood has played
host to its share of devils on film. Roman Polanski doesn't ever
show the devil in his new picture, ``The Ninth Gate,'' which opens
Friday. But then, he's been there, done that. His quick-cut of
Lucifer having his way with a drugged Mia Farrow in ``Rosemary's
Baby'' is probably one of the most powerful satanic images ever put
on film.
</P>
<P>
   The list of devilish turns by actors is as eclectic as it is
lengthy, running the gamut from Tim Curry (``Legend'') to Bill
Cosby (``The Devil and Max Devlin.'') And let's not forget his
satanic majesty's cameo in last summer's ``South Park: Bigger,
Longer &AMP; Uncut.'' Here are a few other ideas for having a devil of
a time on your VCR:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Witches of Eastwick'': Jack Nicholson as the devil? Are
we talking typecasting or what? In this adaptation of John Updike's
satirical novel, Nicholson plays a devilish stranger who shows up
in a proper New England town and seduces three delectable divorcees
(Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon, Cher) who then turn the tables
on him. The movie's subtext _ feminism as a form of modern-day
witchcraft _ is less than spellbinding, but you're in such good
company that it's hard to complain. Nicholson went about
researching his character in a typically offbeat way: Besides
reading the Updike novel, he studied Gustav Dore's illustrations
for ``Dante's Inferno'' and pored over St. Thomas Aquinas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Needful Things'': Things supernatural have always come
naturally to Stephen King. In this adaptation of one of his
ubiquitous best sellers, all hell breaks loose in the quiet hamlet
of Castle Rock, Maine, when a seemingly avuncular Max von Sydow
opens a curio shop named _ what else? _ Needful Things. His
inventory is slight but oddly on target. That is, he just happens
to carry your secret heart's desire, be it old baseball cards or an
amulet that cures arthritis. The inevitable disintegration into
over-the-top mayhem is a disappointment, but the movie offers a
frisky, tongue-in-cheek spirit and good performances. For those who
take note of such things, von Sydow may be the only actor to have
played the devil, Jesus Christ (``The Greatest Story Ever Told'')
and the Grim Reaper (``The Seventh Seal'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Angel Heart'': When it was released, there was an awful lot
of fuss over the prospect of a naked ``Cosby'' kid (Lisa Bonet).
But Mickey Rourke treats her a lot better than he did Kim Basinger
in ``9 1/2 Weeks.'' The movie itself is a kind of amalgam of Faust
and film noir. Or Sam Spade Meets Mr. Scratch. Set in the 1950s, it
stars Rourke as a seedy private eye hired by a mysteriously smooth
dandy (Robert De Niro in a goatee ... hint, hint) to help him in a
missing persons case. It's a Mephistophelean murder mystery
suffused with blood, sex and a touch of eye-of-newt nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Devil and Daniel Webster'': Director William Dieterle
(``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' ``Portrait of Jenny'') had just
left Warner Bros. and formed his own company when he filmed this
adaptation of Stephen Vincent Benet's famous story. Edward Arnold
plays Webster, the celebrated Yankee barrister, and James Craig is
the poor New England farmer so down on his luck that he
inadvertently summons Mr. Scratch (Walter Huston) when he swears
that he'd sell his soul to the devil for two cents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Damn Yankees'': It ran for 1,019 performances on Broadway
before being made into a movie by the same team that did ``The
Pajama Game.'' Based on the book ``The Year the Yankees Lost the
Pennant,'' the film is a variation on the famous Faustian bargain.
In this case, an aging Washington Senators fan offers his soul as
collateral for the chance to be transformed into a powerhouse
ballplayer in order to beat the unbeatable New York Yankees. The
stars are Tab Hunter (surprisingly good) and Gwen Verdon (always
good), but the movie is stolen by Ray Walston as a particularly
petulant devil.

ANALYSTS MAKE OVERHEATED MARKET BURN EVEN HOTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday, the stock price of PMC-Sierra, a chip maker, jumped to
230 from 201. The main reason? An analyst raised his 12-month price
target on the stock from 200 to 250.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the stock price of Art Technology Group, a Boston
software company, jumped 25 percent in a single day when an analyst
at Credit Suisse First Boston initiated his coverage with a
``strong buy'' rating. The analyst predicted the stock, then
trading for 125, would reach 200 in the next year. It hit 156 that
day. It closed Tuesday at 185.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been recommending stocks forever. Price targets
are nothing new, either. But the market's huge and immediate
reactions to them is a ``new, new'' thing, according to veteran
money managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the latest manifestation of a market that is
taking everything to extremes,'' said Thomas O'Neill, chief
investment officer at FleetBoston Financial Corp. The price targets
are often based on questionable logic, O'Neill said, yet investors
treat them as if they were edicts from on high.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill may be a traditionalist, but he is clearly on to
something here. Is it really big news that an analyst has launched
coverage of a stock with a ``strong buy'' rating? In a world where
no one ever recommends selling a stock, is a ``strong buy'' rating
something to get excited about?
</P>
<P>
   And how real are these targets? ``In my years of experience, I
have not seen many people who can actually forecast a price of a
security,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State
Street Global Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet day after day, technology stocks soar on news that analysts
have set targets somewhere above the current stock price. The
targets usually are one-year projections. But the stocks react
immediately, often reaching the one-year targets in no time flat.
It is as if investors are saying: ``Why should I wait for a whole
year for the stock to go up, when it can go up right now?''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the analysts setting the targets seem a bit
bewildered. Consider the experience of Sam May, an analyst for US
Bancorp Piper Jaffrey who tracks the fortunes of Alpha Industries,
a supplier to the cellular phone business.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, with the price of Alpha stock at 55, May recommended
the shares and issued a 12-month price target of 65. The stock hit
65 by mid-January. On Feb. 14, with Alpha stock at 115, May once
again recommended Alpha, but this time he set his 12-month target
at 155. Alpha closed Tuesday at 136.
</P>
<P>
   May still likes Alpha. He says the company has excellent
fundamentals and prospects. But he concedes that setting price
targets in today's market is an inexact science. ``With the
valuations getting pushed up so high, it is hard to keep targets
for more than two weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm, another cellular stock, has also benefited from
analyst projections. In late December, Walter Piecyk, an analyst
with Paine Webber, said Qualcomm would reach 1000 in a year. At the
time, the stock traded for 500.
</P>
<P>
   Piecyk's recommendation, along with news of a planned stock
split, pushed Qualcomm shares up about 40 percent over the next
four days.
</P>
<P>
   Piecyk didn't just pull his price target out of the air. It was
based on his calculation of the money Qualcomm would reap in
royalty payments on its key cellular technology. Piecyk estimated
those payments would reach $20 billion a year by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   In a nifty piece of analysis, two Business Week reporters,
writing in the March 6 issue of the magazine, demolish most of
Piecyk's assumptions. They say he overestimated cell phone growth
and cell phone prices and underestimated the impact that
competition would have on Qualcomm's royalty revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: That $20 billion figure could be an awful lot
smaller. Qualcomm's stock price has dropped considerably from its
January highs.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, a money manager with Loomis Sayles, said the
hyper-reactions to analyst recommendations may be the result of the
invasion of the stock market by day traders. Day traders are
momentum players, and they look for any bit of news which might
move a stock. In the absence of real news, analyst recommendations
can fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he and his colleagues take note of the
recommendations only when they come from analysts with track
records. ``Otherwise, we prefer to concentrate on fundamentals,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Us too. We have no problem with analysts making recommendations
and setting targets, but when those targets become self-fulfilling
prophecies, we get a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is just feeding on itself,'' said O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   We agree. And we have a question: When the whole technology
market starts to unravel, will analysts set lower price targets on
the way down?

BAD MANNERS CAN RUIN FOREIGN DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry M. Seals was appalled.
</P>
<P>
   After telling representatives of a US information technology
firm about the importance of Japanese etiquette and protocol, he
was stunned when they sabotaged what could have been a lucrative
deal by insisting a contract be drafted right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, when you and a group of Japanese businessmen have
the first business meeting, the point is not to negotiate,'' said
Seals. ``The point is to establish a relationship, to get to know
you, and to see what kind of person you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had explained that there would be many meetings before
negotiations actually began. I'd also explained that negotiations
always take place over dinner or drinks, but the US firm wanted to
fly out of Japan the next day, and it ignored my advice.''
</P>
<P>
   The American firm's brashness was seen as rudeness. Its
representatives' insistence on a contract, and their many
questions, were considered intrusive. Politely, the Japanese
businessmen promised they would soon be in touch. But they never
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can do in Japan during a first meeting is
to try and pressure a potential partner or client into making a
decision,'' Seals said.
</P>
<P>
   The next worst thing? ``Not giving a business card the proper
deference and attention it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many US firms now involved in international business
deals, companies are finding that familiarity with the host
country's business protocol, language, mores, and customs is more
important than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, some US companies are turning to intercultural
specialists or consultants, such as Seals, for help. These new
gurus are not unlike the diversity specialists who in the 1980s
helped US companies understand issues of class, sex, gender, and
race in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Seals, chief executive of MG Technologies &AMP; Investments Inc., an
IT and consulting firm in Japan, spends much of his time helping
Asian high-tech firms form alliances with companies in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   His firm teams with a Nevada-based e-commerce company,
BiPacificLink Inc., which helps US firms use the Internet to market
their products in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the 25-year-old African-American consultant and
author of ``Making It In Japan: An Insider's Journey to Success,''
was a keynote speaker at the Harvard Club in Cambridge, Mass.
There, he offered the following tips:
</P>
<P>
   --Practice Japanese etiquette before a business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes, it is disarming to the Japanese when a foreigner
sits across from them and demonstrates that he or she understands
the etiquette,'' Seals sid. ``It tells them that the meeting was
important enough to you that you took the time to learn
etiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   --Never handle a Japanese business card lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese business card is equivalent to a person's face.
You are expected to take it with both hands, and give your own with
both hands. You look at it, you examine it, you touch it from time
to time. . . When a Japanese company invites an American service
provider to Japan, the company representatives feel that they have
extended to you the honor of meeting them. You are expected to show
you are thankful. This is done by showing respect for the card. To
take a business card and stuff it in your pocket or purse is an
insult. To write on a business card in the presence of the person
who gave it to you is also an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   --Don't expect to make a deal right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most American companies and their representatives come to
meetings assuming that something will be decided right away. What
they don't realize is that the person or people you are talking to
can't make a deal. The person is simply there to determine what
kind of person you are. He will watch your body language, how you
speak, how you present yourself. Then, he will take the information
back to the people who run the company. Later, usually after
several meetings, the negotiations will begin.''
</P>
<P>
   --Don't shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handshaking is not a custom,'' Seals noted. ``People in Japan
are not used to that firm American grip. They would rather bow. The
bow shows deference and respect for the culture. . . . Even though
you may be the customer, the company representative from Japan will
bow deeply when you appear. Why? Because you are an honored guest
in his country and at his company. . . . This bow is almost 60
degrees, and it is done very slowly. The chief executive will bow
only 45 degrees. In either case, the American representative should
bow deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the Japanese, manners and etiquette are very important,''
added Seals. ``If you can perform correctly, if you know the rules
of etiquette, then the feeling is that you can be trusted to act
prudently in another environment, the business environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Seals learned those rules the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   As an undergraduate at Harvard College, he had immersed himself
in East Asian studies, particularly Chinese and Japanese culture.
He learned to speak Japanese and Mandarin Chinese fluently and
spent his junior year in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1996, Seals accepted a full-time job at a
midsize IT firm in Kyota, Japan. There, he learned that subtle
differences in style, tone of voice, behavior, even gestures, could
make or break a business deal. He also learned about the importance
of manners and that the primacy of the group is more important in
Japan than the individual's desires.
</P>
<P>
   But by his own account, Henry Seals is also an anomaly: Few
African-Americans do business in Japan. He maintains, however, that
his race was never an issue during the two years he worked for a
company identified in his book by the pseudonym Mitsui. Instead, he
said, coworkers and supervisors were more concerned about the way
he conducted himself _ his manners, his willingness to learn, his
ability to follow directions and accept without question the
demands of his supervisors and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   At Mitsui, Seals was assigned to a ``senpai,'' or mentor, who
was responsible for showing the new employee how to be a complete
member of society and adjust to the specific requirements of the
firm. A senpai taught the new recruit the inner workings of
corporate politics, how to write a business letter, how to deal
with stress on the job, how to handle the large amount of social
drinking expected in a typical work week, and how to take criticism
in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Seals's senpai tried to teach him how to handle criticism by
constantly criticizing his mistakes, an approach Seals was not used
to and that he bridled against.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this relationship, it was expected that there would be
disagreements, even conflicts,'' noted Seal. ``But that was
unsettling to me. I found a senpai could actually punish you.
Hazing could also occur in which you might see an adult male, 45
years old, being scolded, even slapped, by a superior. . . .
Although I was a freshman in the company with no ranking or title,
it helped that I spoke the language and could assist Mitsui in
setting up partnerships with overseas firms.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Seals recalled an incident in which
his hand was slapped by a supervisor because he had not found the
appropriate computer screen. When Seals questioned the supervisor,
he was told: ``To me, you are like a child, my child. I must do
this to help you be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Richmond, Va., Seals said a friendship with a Japanese
member of his high school track team sparked his interest in
Japanese language and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran track together, and we talked a lot about the
differences in our countries,'' he said. ``But the more we talked,
the more I realized how little I knew about the world outside of
the two states where I had lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Seals now lives in Japan with his wife and daughter.

&HT;     LESSONS FOR MANAGERS FROM `THE WEST WING' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There was a great scene in ``The West Wing''
television program a few weeks ago that a lot of bosses could have
learned from. The president was about to give the State of the
Union address, but the secretary of agriculture had to be left
behind at the White House so that someone from the presidential
line of succession would survive if the Capitol blew up.
</P>
<P>
   On the slight chance that something would go wrong, the
president told the secretary how to handle national security, and
that one of the toilets in the residence needs to be jiggled every
once in a while. They also had this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a best friend?'' the president asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' the secretary replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he smarter than you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you trust him with your life?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your chief of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with that picture? Not a thing _ except that too
many bosses will be oblivious to it.
</P>
<P>
   The scene offers several lessons: A few things can be handled
only by the boss. Just as the president has to have a strong hand
in national security, some life-and-death items in business can be
handled only by the chief executive. But often bosses get so caught
up in the day-to-day frenzy that they don't stop to think about how
they are performing a lot of mundane tasks that ought to be
delegated.
</P>
<P>
   The other danger is that they have become such perfectionists
that they can't let go of anything. If you delegate, certainly your
subordinates might not handle tasks as well as you would. But you
can teach them how to do better, and then have time to concentrate
on the important parts of your job. If you never delegate, nothing
will ever improve.
</P>
<P>
   You got a best friend? One of the first things a boss needs to
do is hire a reliable second in command, or at least make sure
you're happy with whoever already holds the job. At work, that
person will be your best friend, even if you never see each other
socially.
</P>
<P>
   Should he really be your best friend? Probably not. Too many
people will think he was appointed because of that rather than
because of talent. Besides, having a best friend away from your
office might at least give you some chance of balancing your work
with the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   But your second in command should at least be worthy of being
your friend. That doesn't mean you have to have a lot in common or
laugh at the same jokes, but he ought to be someone you like and
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Do other people seem to respect him? Do you? Would you be
embarrassed to have him represent you at an important meeting?
Would you trust him with your kids? If you don't like the answers
to any of those questions, you have the wrong person.
</P>
<P>
   Is he smarter than you? He ought to be, at least in some ways.
Even if you're a member of Mensa, you can find someone who's
smarter than you in many aspects of the job. Maybe he has better
people skills or is more organized or doesn't get as frazzled under
pressure as you do. Maybe he's more creative or more pragmatic or
better at seeing things as other people see them.
</P>
<P>
   Business guru Tom Peters says that if you are a chief executive
and your chief operating officer and your chief financial officer
agree on everything, you should fire one of them. They ought to be
seeing things from different perspectives because their jobs are so
different. If they always agree, one of them is superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   If you and your second in command always agree, you have the
wrong person. You have someone who is either dumber than you or
afraid to disagree with you. In either case, he's the wrong person
_ or you're the wrong boss.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're afraid to go outside your comfort zone. Are you
interviewing candidates from the opposite sex and different
ethnicities? Have you considered people whose backgrounds are far
different than yours? Do you encourage creativity or discourage it?
Remember: You're looking for someone to complement you, not a
clone.
</P>
<P>
   If you still can't find anyone, build a bigger office. You'll
need it for your ego.
</P>
<P>
   Would you trust him with your life? Maybe that's a bit
melodramatic, but you do have to trust your second in command in
two crucial ways: decision-making and back-stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Except for earth-shattering matters, you have to let your second
in command make a lot of decisions or you'll make yourself crazy.
If he has to ask your permission before blowing his nose, something
is seriously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Explain what you consider before making decisions and make sure
he understands your goals and concerns. Then let him handle a lot
of the minor things, and gradually move up to more major decisions.
</P>
<P>
   You won't always agree with everything that he does, but that's
all right. If he's following the ``wrong'' path, find out why.
Maybe he has a better strategy than you do. If not, gently correct
him.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken cause of a lot of weak hiring is a boss's own
insecurity. If I hire a relative incompetent, the thinking goes,
I'll just appear even more useful to my own boss. When layoffs
come, I'll be safe.
</P>
<P>
   That might be true, but you'll also ensure that you never reach
your full potential. People who operate weak departments rarely get
promoted (except by insecure bosses, of course), and you will never
really be able to get away from the office because you know that
you've left an incompetent in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Trust works both ways, of course. Your second in command has to
trust that you will support him, even in tough times, and help him
achieve whatever career goals he has.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, you have to jiggle the toilet yourself. Your
second in command is not a flunky. Give him enough choice
assignments to keep him interested, and do a few mundane tasks on
your own to keep yourself humble.
</P>
<P>
   If you do it well enough, who knows? Someday you might be
president.

&HT;     COMPELLING BOOK TELLS OF REWARDS, RISKS IN KING CRAB COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Can you imagine making $100,000 in a month while
working in the great outdoors in Alaska?
</P>
<P>
   That is the fantasy that drives being a commercial crabber on
the Bering Sea, where you experience the marrow of life of the
great outdoors while getting a stake in the last great Alaskan gold
rush _ king crab.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it doesn't always turn out that way, says former Alaskan
crabber Spike Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The money is like an intoxicant, compelling you to take
ridiculous chances in the face of advancing storms that can bring
25-foot seas pushed by icy 50-mph Arctic winds, he'll tell you. In
short order, you can discover that the romanticized vision of the
Alaskan coast often turns out to be a nightmare: For a greenhorn
from the mainland who actually gets such a job, the odds of
clearing $75,000 in a few weeks are about the same as dying at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of this life, the fast money and the elemental
danger, are captured in the book ``Working on the Edge'' by Walker,
published by St. Martin's Press. I found this is one of the best
outdoor books written in the past 10 years, capturing both the
danger and greed that breathes through the pores of commercial
crabbers.
</P>
<P>
   The tales ring true, and along the way, you feel as if you are
aboard the boats, working shoulder to shoulder with the crabbers,
trying to get rich quick.
</P>
<P>
   The chance for big money is real, Walker says, having himself
fished crab on a commercial boat for several years, making $80,000
to $120,000 in the one-month king crab season just as a hand on a
boat. At the same time, he tells of a poster at a Seattle ferry
terminal that reads: ``If You Don't Already Have A Job In Alaska
... Don't Go!''
</P>
<P>
   This also rings true. A friend of mine recently headed up ``to
get a job on a crab boat and make a ton of money fast'' and after
six weeks of unemployment, finally got a job delivering pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   Walker dedicates a section of the book to the big money fantasy
called ``The Greenhorn,'' and then, in turn, puts the reader on
board with a series of staggering encounters of men against the
sea. In the end, the number of deaths certify that commercial
crabbing off Alaska is the most dangerous job in the world: 42
deaths in 1988 alone. In a typical year, Walker writes that 15
percent of all crab boats fishing in Alaska are either ``destroyed,
sunk, salvaged or in some way repaired.''
</P>
<P>
   What Walker manages to do is weave his own encounters with those
of the survivors of several disasters. In one story, he describes
how ``reezing spray'' creates ice blocks on everything it touches,
and how ice can quickly build a foot or higher on the deck of the
boat. That can create so much weight that it can make the boat
top-heavy and capsize it in a big swell. The icing phenomenon is
verified in one photograph where the crab traps look like giant ice
cubes.
</P>
<P>
   In another story, the author describes how fortunes can turn in
seconds:
</P>
<P>
   ``On board the Gemini, the leaden layer of ice continued to
build, thickening to a depth of several feet. ... As the boat rose
sluggishly up and over a large wave, the bottom of the wave trough
directly ahead seemed just to fall out from under them. The ship
plummeted right down into it and the full weight of the next wave
collapsed upon them. With the sound of a rifle shot, the spinnaker
window exploded backward into wheelhouse. ... Soon after the
skipper's Mayday call went out, the boat's engines died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going down.''
</P>
<P>
   In that episode, it turns out, the crew was saved. In many
others, they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A young crewman named Keith Richards had placed himself
between a crab pot and the handrailing in an effort to untie a pot
when the deck rolled sharply. The stack shifted and a loose crab
pot slid into the youngster, knocking him overboard. Richards was
unable to save himself, completely immobile (from the freezing
ocean), like a sack of potatoes, and started to sink.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker describes the biggest boom years of the Alaskan crab
fishery, its collapse and then the rebuilding of the fishery that
has occurred since. Most of the book describes the boom years, and
even though now nearly 20 years removed, the stories are well
crafted and full of fire ... and it remains relevant to anybody
who's fantasized a bit about bailing out on life in the Lower 48 _
and heading to Alaska based on the dreams of easy money and
adventure.

GORE CHAT; DARVA DEFENSE; SPIN RE-SPUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With some pushing of nostalgia buttons, Rolling Stone for March
16 chitchats about pop culture and the 1960s with Al Gore. The
interview, conducted by Jann Wenner and Will Dana, would be more
interesting if it turned out that Gore absolutely hated Bob Dylan,
but of course he worships Dylan, prefers the electric ``Highway 61
Revisited'' days, and even manages to quote from ``Blowing in the
Wind'' and warble out lyrics from ``Just Like a Woman'' before the
tape recorder has been shut off. The VP also fancies Bonnie Raitt,
John Mayall, and k.d. lang, just in case you're trying to envision
an all-star Gore inaugural event.
</P>
<P>
   The authors tell us Gore ``is neither wooden nor robotic'' but
``enjoys a hard-won sense of casualness,'' and the photos
accompanying the story are also meant to counteract the stiff rap.
Here's a mellow Al and Tipper afloat in a Native American-styled
canoe in 1973, he the sideburned dude manning the paddle, she his
Guinevere, lounging in a peasant shirt and bead necklace with what
could be a euphoric smile on her face. Here are the newlyweds
gazing at each other amid the hay of the Gore family farm in 1970,
Tipper looking rather mod in her Carnaby Street sunglasses. And
here's a literary-looking Al as a reporter in 1971, pensive, his
hands poised on the keys of his typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says the 1960s helped shape his commitment to civil rights,
equal rights, and human rights, but they don't seem to have
determined his views on pot. ``I think that drawing a hard line
against marijuana use is the right thing to do,'' he says, in the
context of the fact that he does not favor decriminalization. About
youth violence, Gore puts gun availability and the need for
emotional support systems higher on his list of contributing causes
than violent imagery in entertainment. And he says he plans to
raise environmental issues more, as the campaign proceeds.

   I couldn't resist the cover lines on this week's People, which
has Madonna pronouncing, ``I'm going to be the mother I never
had.'' Mother, indeed. The story gives up all the details about her
non-spoiling approach to parenting, her decision to name daughter
Lourdes after the French town her mother wanted to visit before she
died, her continuing friendship with Carlos Leon, Lourdes's father,
and her love affair with filmmaker Guy Ritchie. Using her best
British inflection, she notes, ``Being in love, being loved keeps
you young. True, that.'' Pretentious, she.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, we may be heading toward adding yet another name to
the list of celebrities who are recognizable by first name only,
like Arnold, or Barbra. I'm speaking of Darva, of course, the
now-ubiquitous nurse who felt she might want to marry a
multimillionaire and is living to regret it. People has a
first-person story in which Conger passionately defends herself
against all the people who think of her as a gold digger and a
spiritual cousin to Linda Tripp. Basically, she thought going on
the show would be fun after a rough year. ``The possibility that he
was a multimillionaire didn't appeal to me,'' she says. ``Actually
it was sort of a negative. Because money doesn't buy everything in
this world.'' She reminds us that we shouldn't see her as a ``moral
compass,'' and she puts herself into a larger cultural perspective:
``What I did here didn't hurt anybody, I didn't kill anybody. I
didn't do bad things with the president.''

   Spin for April is a special issue in honor of the magazine's
15th anniversary. That means pages upon pages of old Spin article
excerpts on the rise of ``alternative'' music, including the old
Nirvana stories and the wacky wisdom of Courtney Love, who is shown
curtseying in one of her famous kinderwhore dresses; on the murder
of Tupac Shakur; on the advent of Beck; on the reports of violence
at Woodstock '99; on the spreading of AIDS; and so on and so forth.
It's not a bad issue necessarily _ the photos of object-icons like
Slash's top hat, Flavor Flav's clock, and Kurt Cobain's shirt from
the ``Smells Like Teen Spirit'' video are a little witty. But,
coming so close on the heels of the world's recent orgy of
decade-century-millennium views and reviews, it's a rather
redundant retrospective.

&HT;     TB IS SAN FRANCISCO'S OTHER DEADLY DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT WINOCUR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ My interest in tuberculosis originated in
childhood, when my father had TB and was put in a sanitarium for
nine months. I remember waving through a window at a pale-skinned
man in a bathrobe and feeling frightened, lost and lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Illness is a great divider.
</P>
<P>
   My dad survived. I'm not sure I did. Mycobacterium tuberculosis
haunts me to this day. I imagine it lurking beneath my skin,
waiting for an opportunity to blossom into a horrid, devouring
ailment.
</P>
<P>
   TB is an important public-health issue in San Francisco because
the city _ a perennial magnet for immigrants and one of the world's
most densely populated places _ always has been tuberculosis
country.
</P>
<P>
   The number of new TB cases in San Francisco has dropped from the
early 1990s, when it peaked at 356 (in 1993), but it remains high:
4.5 times the national rate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Masae Kawamura, director of the health department's TB
control program, said, ``There are pockets of TB in our city where
the case rates are as high as Africa. As a whole, San Francisco's
rates are as high as Mexico's, 35 per 100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Kawamura said the Tenderloin, South of Market and Chinatown
neighborhoods are the ``pockets'' that concern her, along with the
city's homeless shelters and transient hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean it's dangerous for a healthy person to go there?
No, Kawamura said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come from a risk group where the incidence is high or
if you work with high-risk groups, you need to be tested, but TB is
not that easy to catch. The probability of getting TB from one
cough or one sneeze is very low,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be appropriate, nonetheless, that on Friday, March 24 _
the 118th anniversary of TB discoverer Robert Koch's presentation
of his findings in Berlin _ San Franciscans make a special effort
to observe World TB Day, sponsored by the World Health Organization
(WHO).
</P>
<P>
   Its purpose is to heighten awareness of the disease, which has
infected an estimated 2 billion people worldwide, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the epidemic has taken on a new dimension with
the emergence of drug-resistant strains of TB, often the
consequence of failure to complete the standard six-month course of
drug therapy. Multidrug-resistant TB is fatal 60 percent of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   This year WHO is pushing for World TB Day tie-ins with women's
groups, human rights groups and HIV/AIDS groups, which it calls the
``new TB constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   TB is the single biggest infectious killer of women in the
world, with about 1 billion females infected, according to WHO. Of
the estimated 2.1 million people who die annually from TB, WHO
says, a disproportionate number are women in their reproductive
years. TB takes their lives at more than twice the rate of war and
three times the rate of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights groups? They advocate for the masses of mistreated
people throughout the world _ the same people whose living
conditions, including
</P>
<P>
   homelessness and poverty, foster the spread of TB.
</P>
<P>
   But what about HIV/AIDS groups? Where do they fit in?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is that one of every three AIDS-related deaths
is directly caused by TB. When AIDS came along, TB discovered a
partner in crimes against humanity. There is nothing more likely
than HIV to turn a dormant TB cell into an active one, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 million to 15 million Americans infected with TB
alone, an estimated 10 percent will develop active cases. For
people with HIV and TB infection, however, the risk of developing
active TB cases is 100 times greater.
</P>
<P>
   Groups working with AIDS patients are aware of the association.
Joel Rubinstein, a volunteer with Project Open Hand and the
citizens' lobby RESULTS, said he was required to take a TB test
before he was permitted to go into the homes of people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have it come out negative,`` Rubinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the San Francisco Bay, a 45-agency public and private TB
task force will make a presentation to the Alameda County Board of
Supervisors on March 21, in conjunction with World TB Day.
</P>
<P>
   On March 24, San Francisco health officials will hold a news
conference at the gates of Chinatown to announce a new outreach
program targeting TB in the Chinese community.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign-born Chinese have inactive cases of TB acquired
abroad, Kawamura said, that could become activated by the stresses
of life in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the initiative,'' Kawamura said, ``is to get
people
</P>
<P>
   screened and treated before they become reactivated.''

BILLIONAIRE, HMO EYE REVOLUTIONARY INTERNET-BASED SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Harvard Pilgrim Health Care sent out a distress call to
private investors in January, all who took a look at the HMO's
large losses walked away, except one: H. Ross Perot, who was
willing to risk $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible Texas billionaire, silent during the
negotiations to pull Harvard Pilgrim out of state receivership,
told The Boston Globe this week that his offer, while ultimately
rejected by state regulators, was not just about helping to right
Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   It was about creating a whole new kind of HMO that could be
marketed around the nation _ and make him more millions.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's Dallas company, Perot Systems, which already has a
10-year, $700 million computer consulting contract with Harvard
Pilgrim, is negotiating a second contract with it to create an
Internet-based ``HMO of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim plans in April to unveil the first stage: a Web
site that will allow employers and employees to enroll online.
</P>
<P>
   Perot envisions a system where hospitals, doctors, employers,
members, and the HMO will by the end of 2001 be able to log on and
update patient accounts. Harvard Pilgrim would wire payments
directly to providers. Sources involved in the negotiations
estimate the cost at less than $20 million, which the HMO and Perot
will split.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have all these genius doctors practicing in all these
elite hospitals,'' Perot said from Dallas. ``What better place to
create a model for how medicine should be practiced in the 21st
century?''
</P>
<P>
   The one-time presidential candidate, who is used to negotiating
with straight-talking ranchers and cattlemen, said he hugely
admires Harvard Pilgrim CEO Charles D. Baker Jr., from whom he got
honest answers.
</P>
<P>
   Perot said it wouldn't have been appropriate to unveil plans for
the new system, called ``Healthbank,'' during the past two months.
But now that state regulators are asking the court to release
Harvard Pilgrim from receivership, the time may be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Charlie is ready to go, we'll go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said his first mission is to implement Harvard Pilgrim's
2000 turnaround plan, then to work toward a model HMO system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every health plan needs to figure this out,'' he said. ``The
amount of time and energy and effort that's spent dealing with all
these different administrative records could be devoted to
improving health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe working with Mr. Perot gives us an opportunity to
develop an Internet-based communication tool that could take a lot
of the administrative headaches out of health care for members, our
employers, and our providers.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot and Baker first got together in October, when Harvard
Pilgrim agreed to pay Perot Systems $700 million over 10 years to
oversee its claims and technology systems _ whose problems are
partly blamed for the HMO's $200 million loss last year.
</P>
<P>
   But when state regulators took over on Jan. 4, Perot got a
scare. He flew to Boston three days later to reassure his troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Protecting you in Boston is a lot easier than trying
to rescue you from Tehran,' '' said Perot, referring to the time he
orchestrated a rescue of an employee jailed in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   During the second week in February, Perot came to Boston to
discuss another rescue mission: the regulators' search for
investors to bail out Harvard Pilgrim. They met in an
out-of-the-way conference room in a Boston hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Like other potential investors, Perot asked that the state back
his $75 million investment _ $15 million more than he personally
spent on his 1992 presidential campaign _ in case Harvard Pilgrim
ultimately failed.
</P>
<P>
   Special Assistant Attorney General J. David Leslie traveled to
Dallas to make a counteroffer: Could Perot guarantee $75 million in
investments that regulators hoped to elicit from hospitals?
</P>
<P>
   Perot agreed.
</P>
<P>
   And as Massachusetts regulators requested, Perot kept the
proposal a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that impressed me with all of them was that they are
totally focused on making sure they preserve this precious thing
they have in Boston,'' Perot said. ``It's like a Faberge egg. You
don't want to drop it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly rejected Perot's
offer because the billioniare businessman wanted to ``assert
significant control'' over Harvard Pilgrim if it did not meet
financial goals and to extend the computer contract.
</P>
<P>
   Perot said he does not know the details of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, he's familar with the vision behind them _ a
vision he believes can be achieved only in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is like a four-legged stool,'' said Perot, who often
uses the words Boston and geniuses in the same sentence. ``You've
got a nonprofit HMO that is focused on patient care, the finest
medical school in the country, world-class hospitals, and genius
doctors. Other places in the country, there is always a piece
missing.''
</P>
<P>
   He dodged a question about whether doctors are smarter in Boston
than in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's bigger in Texas,'' he said. ``If I go to a
hospital in Texas at least they speak Texan.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot, who pays for all of his family's health care in cash,
said the problem with the system is that each doctor's office,
hospital, employer, and insurance company is like a distant island
separated by sea, when they should be connected by software
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospital staff are still carrying around clipboards and
baskets of papers,'' he said. ``All that can be stored on computer.
Now we come to things like X-rays carried around because doctors
like to see film. But with digital technology even soft tissue can
be clearly seen on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time someone enters a patient's Social Security number or
birthdate, it increases the chances of an error _ and the chances
that the HMO's system won't recognize its own patients.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hughes, head of the Massachusetts Association of HMOs,
said the type of system Perot proposes is ``where we're going'' if
obstacles can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is will there be triggers to make sure
people's privacy is protected?'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a technical point of view, it's very doable. But it's
going to take a great deal of thrashing about in terms of
developing standards and privacy controls.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Perot was lampooned often for television
ads that featured him holding a wooden pointer in front of a chart
of the rising national debt. Even during a phone interview, he
spoke of bell curves and graphs.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, he said, it will be a matter of convincing the
various constituencies he and Baker are onto something. ``The
problem is getting all of the groups deciding to do it,'' he said.
``Certainly if someone brings you a new idea then you would want to
see proof. But I'd really be surprised if they weren't on fire when
they hear about it.''

PORTFOLIO'S OK, BUT GOAL'S AN ILLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is our current savings rate enough for retirement by age 60
and college for two? Are we being too conservative? Should we
invest in individual stocks? Do we have enough diversity? How much
should we be saving monthly?
</P>
<P>
   H.S., Andover, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let me back into it, please. Suppose you calculate that you
could retire comfortably on the equivalent of $80,000 in today's
money. In 25 years, you would need $189,059 a year, if inflation
averages 3.5 percent a year until then. I bet you see where I am
going: You won't even come close.
</P>
<P>
   If you continue to add $500 a month to your savings for 25 years
and achieve 10 percent average portfolio returns, you would
accumulate $1,259,563 _ which would be depleted in less than nine
years if you maintain a standard of living equivalent to what
$80,000 in today's money buys. And presuming 10 percent growth is
probably unrealistic, in view of the fact that nearly 18 percent of
your current savings are in CDs and bank savings. And missing from
that calculation is the cost of college for your children.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has little to do with the portfolio's makeup; it's
simply that you're not saving enough money. That $500 a month is
just 6 percent of your income; simply stated, it's not enough,
especially since it seems that you have no prospect of a pension.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to triple your savings rate, the projection would be
a little less than $2.5 million, which might get you into the
ballpark, if Social Security is still around at that point. But
even then, chances are that you would look at the likely effect of
inflation once you reach age 60 and decide to keep working another
five years. Then, the accumulation would exceed $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   So the important thing is save a higher percentage _ and to
maintain that percentage whenever your income rises _ so you can
boost your accumulation beyond the projections I have made.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to look at specific accounts:
</P>
<P>
   All of your savings go into taxable accounts, which is likely to
generate significant tax liabilities as you near retirement. I
suggest that you immediately direct $2,000 a year for each of you
into Roth IRA accounts, and keep up that pace. If either of you has
access to a 401(k) plan, a deferred savings plan, a Keogh, or any
other vehicle that will defer taxes on your retirement savings, you
should explore these vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, you're risking too much by putting the largest
segment of your savings into the Munder NetNet fund. This vehicle,
which buys Internet-related securities, is quite risky, and
probably ill-attuned to long-term savings. Of this fund,
Morningstar Mutual Funds says: ``Eye-popping short-term results are
possible, as are big losses. Handle with care.'' This is a
speculative investment, appropriate for only a tiny percentage of a
retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   If you must contribute to this fund, I suggest you limit your
ongoing purchases to about $25 or $50 a month, focusing instead on
the more stable and proven Contrafund and, to a lesser extent,
Safeco Growth. I know results such as NetNets' 175.7 percent gain
for 1999 and its 32.09 percent year-to-date advance are dazzling,
but those kinds of bubbles pop very quickly. My suggestion would be
$400 a month to Contrafund and $100 to Safeco Growth. Let the
NetNet bet ride, but don't add to it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I have been saving and investing all our lives,
hoping we will have enough to last us through our lives. Each of
the three segments of our portfolio, listed above, provides about a
third of our income (with pensions and such combining to bring the
income from the final segment up to a third). I plan to invest any
funds that come from the maturing or calling of individual bonds in
the bond fund. I do not feel it is wise to invest in the stock
market, due to our ages and limited knowledge of the market. I know
we are not diversified, but feel somewhat safe. Your thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   C.P., El Cajon, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if you rode out the municipal bond market of the last
year with tranquility, I guess you have the temperament to rely so
heavily on one market segment. Yes, by and large municipal bonds
are safe, and their only drawback is their capacity to lose market
value when interest rates rise. But they also gain in value when
rates fall _ and in the end, a good municipal bond portfolio should
be pretty stable, delivering a steady tax-free income stream in the
meantime. In the last 12 months, the median California municipal
bond fund had a negative total return of 3.5 percent, but it's
reasonable to presume the worm will eventually turn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'd look for a little more diversification, which you
could achieve by putting the proceeds from maturing bonds or
recalls of bonds into something like five-year CDs, which offer
pretty attractive rates (see the letter below). Of course, if you
are in an overall tax situation which would mean that you would
have less income after paying the taxes on the CD income, that
would be a mistake. And I agree with you about the stock market:
It's no place for a fellow of your age who is uncertain about his
understanding of equities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have no income, aside from my investments, and I collect no
pension. My wife is employed, but her $25,000 salary is barely
making it. I plan to start withdrawing from my 401(k) at age 60.
Where can I get a better return on my 401(k)? Can I withdraw from
the 401(k) without a penalty? Can my 401(k) be rolled over into
another account, such as an IRA?
</P>
<P>
   A.B., Monroe, N.Y. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The answer is a fairly traditional and simple one: Buy CDs.
If all of your funds were put into five-year CDs, you could earn as
much as 7.59 percent, citing the highest five-year rate available
as this is written. That would bring you $24,288 a year _ just a
bit more than what you require. It would also require that you do a
lot of shopping around, since CD rates vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   You would be able to roll over the 401(k) money into an IRA
without penalty, although you would face the tax liability on your
withdrawals as they are made.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially important that you get out of your tax-free
bond holding, since I suspect that you are not in a sufficiently
high tax bracket to benefit from its tax-exempt feature. You would
probably be considerably better off taking the higher yield from
the CD and paying the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When the impending takeover of NEES is completed,
stockholders will receive a set amount for their shares. My shares
were acquired through dividend reinvestment over 25 years. Each
year I paid taxes on the amount the shares increased. When I
receive the buyout check, how do I compute the taxes due?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Shrewsbury, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The critical figure in determining your capital gain is
called base cost. Your base cost consists of your original
investment (including any brokerage fees), plus the dollar amount
of all of those dividend reinvestments, plus the dollar amount of
any additional cash investments you may have paid into the DRIP.
Then, subtract your base cost from the amount you receive from the
buyout to determine your capital gain.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ In Southern California, the busiest air space in
the world, there are plans for new runways and new airports in an
effort to bring a more regional approach to aviation. There is even
talk of a high-speed rail system to shuttle passengers to and from
the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   And opponents of the projects, searching for allies in the
courts and on the airwaves, are hoping to kill a new airport
project at the ballot box Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles World Airports, the governmental agency that runs
Los Angeles International Airport (known as LAX) and three other
airports, is planning a $10 billion to $12 billion expansion of LAX
to meet forecasted demand that could see the number of passengers
climb to 98 million from 61 million by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the money involved and the scale, it is just like
Boston's Logan International Airport, which plans to spend more
than $3 billion in the next several years to add terminal space,
build a new runway, and improve regional distribution of flights by
drumming up business for Worcester. And Amtrak is close to
unveiling high-speed service between New York and Boston that could
cut down on shuttle flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our discussions could be the same, with the only difference
being the names,'' said Mike Gordon, mayor of El Segundo, a city of
about 16,000 hard against LAX, where the roar from jets taking off
and landing at the world's third-busiest airport is constant.
</P>
<P>
   The airports in Boston and Los Angeles are just two of more than
a dozen major airports around the country _ from Miami to Seattle,
from Detroit to Dallas _ planning or constructing runways and
multibillion-dollar improvements. The goals are either to reduce
delays _ as is the case in Boston and San Francisco, where there is
talk of filling in two square miles of the bay for a new runway _
or to handle the ever-increasing demand for capacity, or both.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Congress hammered out an agreement to fund the
Federal Aviation Administration and airport improvements by raising
the ticket surcharge levied on each passenger. Under the negotiated
agreement between the House and Senate, the so-called passenger
facility charges will rise from $3 per one-way flight to $4.50,
which will bring in another $1.4 billion a year. The Massachusetts
Port Authority, which owns and operates Logan, has not yet
determined whether it will raise its user fees, but officials
believe it could bring in another $18 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   A smoothly operating national aviation system is critical to the
country's economic well-being. The most recent forecast indicates
annual passnger counts to approach 1 billion in 2010, from more
than 600 million now.
</P>
<P>
   Modernizing airports _ both the terminals and airfields _ is the
mantra of politicians and industry officials around the country.
Airports pump billions of dollars into local economies, and
decisions on whether to expand an airport are made, for the most
part, locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modernizing LAX is the only answer,'' said Ezunial Burts,
president of the L.A. Chamber of Commerce. ``Passengers are going
to come anyway. We weren't drumming up business, but this is the
gateway to the Pacific. And if nothing is done it will mean longer
lines and delay.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the opposition, whether in Boston or Los Angeles,
fighting the expansion _ which invariably means more noise, more
traffic, and more air pollution _ almost always means operating in
a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the battles are fought in isolation,'' says Dennis
McGrann, executive director of Washington-based NOISE, the national
organization to ensure a sound-controlled environment. ``The fights
are absent a national debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sometimes it is hard to even come to a regional
consensus, let alone a national one.
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon has filed suit against LAX for making piecemeal
improvements to an airport that he believes should have undergone
environmental review, the dispute over airport expansion is even
more bitter to the south in neighboring Orange County, where the
majority of the county supervisors want to turn El Toro, a
4,700-acre former Marine Corps Air Station, into a busy commercial
international airport. They are doing so in the face of significant
community opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But hoping for a national solution is a pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't even get people to look at this regionally,'' said
Susan Withrow, a city councilor in Mission Viejo and an El Toro
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Even officials at the Airports Council International, a trade
association of airports, think there should be more national
coordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Aviation Administration should not take legal
responsibility, but it could do a better job coordinating and
looking at the national capacity needs,'' said Richard Marchi, a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says it cannot take such a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, from a national standpoint, it would be great if the
federal government could dictate where we will have airport
expansion and where we won't,'' said Paul Galis, the FAA's deputy
associate administrator for airports. ``But we can't. The
underlying premise is that airports are local matters, controlled
by local agencies. We are obliged to respond to local
initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the FAA's national airport plan is not so much a
blueprint for where future development should occur to best meet
demand, but an inventory of development plans that are brought to
the agency by local governments. The agency's mandate from
Congress, said Galis, is to support new projects if they make
economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, the effort is decidedly local, and it makes
the controversy over Logan's proposed runway look sedate.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents air advertisments on cable television showing body
bags from a 1965 Marine crash into a mountainside that killed 84
servicemen and crew members headed to Vietnam. And more than 80
local clergy have banded together saying the proposed airport is
morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a highway is built, at least they pay you for your
property, but here there will be 747s flying over our houses,''
said John Steward, pastor of the Mount of Olives Lutheran Church in
Mission Viejo. ``To love your neighbor as yourself is the basis of
moral judgment, and if someone lived elsewhere they would not want
it to happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials pushing the airport conversion say it is needed to
preserve the economic good times in Orange County, maintain the
area's competitiveness in a global economy, and generate jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But numerous safety questions have been raised about the
project, and the Air Line Pilots Association has vehemently opposed
the siting of a commercial airfield there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor planning, poor design, and less than desirable topography
will haunt this airport indefinitely,'' said Captain John Russell,
ALPA's regional safety chairman, in a Feb. 16 letter to county
officials. ``El Toro has very few redeeming qualities if any at
all. Put another way, El Toro is the antithesis of what one would
expect from a state-of-the-art facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems, John Wayne Airport is a mere seven miles
away, and the draft environmental report prepared by the county
said takeoffs from El Toro would be with a tail wind into rising
terrain _ a dangerous scenario for high-performance fighter
aircraft, let alone lumbering commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   That point was drilled home to a group of senior citizens
meeting at the Orange Senior Center last weekend, by former Marine
Colonel Thomas F. O'Malley Jr. O'Malley flew KC-130 refueling
aircraft out of the base, and now is working with the El Toro Reuse
Planning Authority, an agency with a $6 million budget that is
trying to turn the base into mixed residential and commercial land
with open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in this room loves to fly more than I do,'' he told the
25 members of the local chapter of the American Association of
Retired Persons. ``And while it was safe for the Marines to fly out
of, it is not safe for the airlines. I'm not telling you scare
tactics. The fact is there is no place more unsafe than an airport
surrounded on three sides by mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   And because John Wayne Airport, also in Orange County but
limited in its ability to grow, is so close, traffic between the
two airports will have to be sequenced by air traffic controllers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Goldman long ago earned a place in Hollywood
history, thanks to a trio of three-word sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't swim,'' Robert Redford tells Paul Newman in ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' (1969). Moviegoers roared, and
Goldman took home his first Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow the money,'' Hal Holbrook's Deep Throat tells Redford's
Bob Woodward in ``All the President's Men'' (1976). Moviegoers
shuddered, many of them voted for Jimmy Carter (Ronald Reagan, for
one, ascribed Gerald Ford's defeat to the movie's success), and
Goldman had another Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   The third sentence, not nearly as well known, won Goldman no
Oscars. Yet among insiders, it is, if anything, even more
cherished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows anything,'' Goldman wrote in his best-selling
``Adventures in the Screen Trade'' (1983), revealing the movie
industry's deepest, darkest secret, that it's all just one big
crapshoot and they don't know why hits succeed and flops don't any
more than you or I do. Readers (or at least the ones who were movie
executives) couldn't decide whether to laugh, shudder, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, 68, has just published what any self-respecting studio
would have called ``Adventures II,'' but whose actual title is
``Which Lie Did I Tell?: More Adventures in the Screen Trade.''
Like its predecessor, ``Lie'' is a shrewd and beguiling blend of
Hollywood war stories, screenwriting shoptalk, and (the closest
thing Goldman has to a trademark as a writer) unstinting joie de
vivre.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of ``Lie'' extends what has been a Goldman hot
streak. In November he published ``The Big Picture,'' a collection
of articles on the industry he's written for New York and Premiere
magazines over the past decade. He shares the writing credit on
``The General's Daughter,'', which grossed more than $100 million
last year. And 1998 saw publication of a 25th anniversary edition
of ``The Princess Bride.'' ``Princess'' is Goldman's favorite among
his 16 novels, which include such best sellers as ``Marathon Man''
(1974) and ``Magic'' (1976), both of which, like ``Bride,'' Goldman
later adapted for the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes you see the movie,'' says screenwriter Tony Gilroy,
who wrote ``The Devil's Advocate'' and ``Armageddon,'' and has
known Goldman for 30 years. ``He's fast, he's fertile, he's
versatile. . . . Who's working now who has more produced credits?
And then, to have credits that go back to `Masquerade' (1965,
Goldman's first screenwriting credit)? He's in the hall of fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, who received the Writers Guild of America's Laurel
Award for Achievement in 1983, is a hall of famer with a
difference. In his longevity, as in his savvy and professionalism,
he's a descendant of such screenwriting legends as Ben Hecht and
Ernest Lehman. Yet unlike them, or his contemporary and fellow
grand master, Robert Towne, he's never directed or produced. He
also remains extremely active.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's current project is an adaptation of Stephen King's
``Hearts in Atlantis'' for Castle Rock Entertainment. The hope is
for a success comparable to his previous King adaptation for Castle
Rock, ``Misery,'' in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few screenwriters who stand out as people who have
done the job again and again,`` King says. ``Of that bunch, William
Goldman is clearly the star on top of the screenwriting Christmas
tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman in person very much resembles Goldman on the page:
animated, alert, effervescent. The strongest impression he conveys
is of a man of enormous enthusiasm. Get him going on one of his
passions _ the New York Knicks, say (he's a season ticketholder of
long standing), or the merits of his favorite movie, the 1939
classic ``Gunga Din'' _ and Goldman's like a teenager on a first
date. ``I don't feel like an elder statesman,'' he says with equal
parts pride and chagrin. ``I'm very immature.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it immaturity, or call it a sense of wonder. But it's an
essential ingredient for succeeding at movie make-believe. When the
lights go down, Goldman reaches for his popcorn just like anybody
else. ``When I go to a movie,'' he says, ``I want to love it. I
just saw `Toy Story 2.' It's terrific. When it's over, you say,
goddam, I'm glad I spent that 90 minutes. I'll remember a lot of
that movie. That's all we're doing: making memories for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman began his moviegoing in the Chicago suburb of Highland
Park, Ill., at the Alcyon Theater, which is where he saw ``Gunga
Din'' (he's seen it 15 times since). Show business got into his
blood early. He claims to have started reading Variety when he was
10. John Kander, the future composer of ``Cabaret'' and ``New York,
New York,'' was a boyhood chum. The two remain friends and, with
Goldman's older brother, James, collaborated on a failed Broadway
musical in 1962. (The elder Goldman, who died in 1968, won his
screenwriting Oscar for adapting his play, ``The Lion in Winter,''
the year before his brother won for ``Butch Cassidy.'')
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's writing career got off to a slow start. He likes to
joke that, despite being editor of the Oberlin College literary
magazine, he still couldn't get it to publish any of his stories.
He got the only C in his creative writing class, and his favorite
short story was rejected 69 times.
</P>
<P>
   He served two years in the Army, doing clerical work in the
Pentagon, then earned a master's degree at Columbia University. Not
interested in teaching, Goldman decided it was up or out on being a
writer. It took him all of 10 days to write his first novel, ``The
Temple of Gold,'' which a publisher promptly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, who'd resigned himself to going back to Chicago to
become an advertising copywriter, never looked back. Over the next
seven years, he published three more novels and collaborated on two
plays. He also married Ilene Jones. The couple, who have two
daughters, divorced in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman owes his screenwriting career to a case of mistaken
literary identity. He gave his fifth novel, ``No Way to Treat a
Lady,'' an unorthodox layout, with some chapters consisting of only
a single sentence. The actor Cliff Robertson saw a copy and thought
it was a film treatment. Impressed, he asked Goldman to do a short
story adaptation and later got him his first screen credit, for
``Masquerade.'' This led to ``Harper'' (1966), Goldman's first
unshared screen credit. Three years later, he sold ``Butch
Cassidy'' for a then-record $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman figures on a screenplay taking him six months from start
to finish. ``When I'm actually starting a movie,'' he explains,
``it's insane not to be able to write three pages a day. That's not
a lot _ there's a lot of space on a movie script page. If you do
that every day for 21 days, guess what, you've got half a movie.
The writing for me is never the hard part. The hard part is the
thinking. . . . When I say it takes me six months to do a movie, I
don't mean I'm writing for six months. I'm writing for a month. The
rest of it is research, trying to figure story, blah blah blah
blah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blah blah blah blah''? Full of himself Goldman is not. ``What
makes Bill great,'' King says, ``is he's a serious-minded person
who's kept his sense of humor.'' The one thing he brags about is
that he's missed just one screenwriting deadline in 35 years (``I
was two weeks late,'' he notes, ``but I got the next draft in two
weeks early''). Certainly, he has few illusions about the
arbitrariness of his profession. ``If (Michael) Douglas and (Val)
Kilmer had been in `Butch Cassidy' instead of Redford and Newman,
you would not remotely be listening to anything I might have to say
about Hollywood,'' he writes in ``Which Lie Did I Tell.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's had too many flops to believe otherwise. His name was
on three movies released in 1992 _ ``The Year of the Comet,''
``Memoirs of an Invisible Man,'' and ``Chaplin'' _ a good year only
for productivity. Assignments he has turned down include ``The
Graduate,'' ``The Godfather,'' and ``Superman.'' Only one scene
from his script for ``The Right Stuff'' made the final cut _ and
for ``Papillon'' it was only one word. He also went through a
``leper'' period in the early '80s, with no screenwriting jobs for
five years.

 NEW YORK: ... five years.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's a strange craft,'' Goldman says. ``If you're in books,
you tend to have a great deal of control. In the movies you have
none, but nobody gets what they want in the movies. In this ghastly
era of deifying directors, you assume the director gets what he
wants. But I don't think even Steven Spielberg gets what he wants.
Everybody's subject to budget, weather, crazy and difficult actors,
your own limitations. Everything's a compromise, I think, in
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, screenwriting is a recipe for frustration. Goldman's
way to protect against its becoming worse than that has been
twofold. He's long lived on Manhattan's Upper East Side, 3,000
miles, three time zones, and multiple states of mind away from LA.
The other defense is not to consider himself a screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a 30-year career as a novelist and in my head that's
what I am. But it's getting harder and harder to justify that. In
the last few years, I've started writing a lot of nonfiction books
and that's an attempt, I suppose, to do something else but movies.
I wrote in `Adventures in the Screen Trade,' `If you're going to be
a screenwriter, you must do something else or you'll go mad.' I
still believe that. It's like being a dentist: It's got a lot of
pluses but also a lot of minuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Marathon Man,'' in which a dental drill famously
ends up in the hands of a Nazi war criminal (played in the movie by
Sir Laurence Olivier), knows a thing or two about filling cavities.
He knows even more about screenwriting, though, and confesses
amazement at how interested the rest of the world has become in his
craft since ``Adventures in the Screen Trade'' was published 17
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The screenwriting interest then, which was phenomenal compared
to when I was a kid, is nothing now to compared to what's happened
in the past 20 years. When I was a kid, you wanted to write the
Great American Novel or you wanted to be (Eugene) O'Neill and write
the great Broadway play. That's over. I don't think anybody who's
18 and wants to write wants to do that. It's screenplays, or maybe
something for the Internet (that I don't know about). Those things
have changed so terribly. Movies are now the center of our
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's as screenwriter, novelist, or journalist, Goldman
still sees himself facing the same problem. ``I'm terrified of
boring people,'' he says. ``I'm terrified you'll stop reading, I'm
terrified you'll stop looking. I'm no more confident (now) than
when I started out. Probably less. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I've been incredibly lucky. I never thought I'd be
here. I never thought I would be writing after 45 years. I never
thought I would have a career. I never thought I would be
successful. I still think I'm in on a pass. When I was a kid, I
wrote once that I came to battle with only two things: a sense of
story and an ear for dialogue. That's all I've ever had. . . . I
wish everything I've written was better, but I've never phoned it
in. I've always tried. What doesn't work is owing to my own
inability.''
</P>
<P>
   William Goldman doesn't have a particularly high opinion of the
movies Hollywood produced during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My list of the 10 best pictures of the decade doesn't have 10
pictures on it,'' he says, laughing, ``and only `Unforgiven' won
(the Oscar for) Best Picture!''

FOOD-FIGHT SHOWDOWN AT THE USDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he edited the American Mercury in the 1930s, H. L. Mencken
loved to invite doctors, primarily from the burgeoning field of
psychiatry, to contribute articles to his magazine. He was
especially delighted, for instance, when Dr. Henry Cotton wrote a
long article demonstrating that infected teeth and tonsils caused
80 percent of mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Mencken loved the medicine men because they could always be
relied on to promote outlandish, mutually contradictory theories
buttressed by rock-solid scientific ``findings.''
</P>
<P>
   One so missed Mencken at last month's Great Nutrition Debate,
held at the US Department of Agriculture. All of the grand shamans
of modern nutrition and diet theory were present: Dr. Robert Atkins
of diet ``revolution'' fame; Marblehead's own Barry Sears, inventor
of The Zone; Dr. Morrison Bethea, the thoracic surgeon who
coauthored ``Sugar Busters!''; and Dr. Dean Ornish (``Eat More,
Weigh Less''), whose primary claim to legitimacy seems to be that
he has appeared on public television.
</P>
<P>
   Mencken would not have been disappointed. These educated men of
science offloaded much silliness during their three hours together.
Bethea said that carrots were too fattening. Sears called food
``the most powerful drug anyone will ever encounter.'' The
assembled cynical hucksters _ Ornish noted that his dieters enjoy
better sex _ felt comfortable denouncing Atkins as a cynical
huckster. Well, maybe, but he has 10 million books in the stores.
Let them throw tomatoes!
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes and other fruit, of course, do not figure large in
Atkins's diet revolution. His ``pork rinds and sausages diet'' is
ridiculed because he allows adherents to chomp down on fatty
snacks, as long as they are low-carb. The venerable, if not
venerated, 69-year-old Atkins managed to survive the food fight
without even playing his trump card: Al Gore is on his diet! (Gore,
who does not campaign on a bus called the Straight Talk Express,
denies this.) Sure, studies reveal that low-carb dieters suffer
from constipation, bad breath, body odor, and headaches . . . who
cares? Tipper's not complaining, and in those loose suits and those
earth-tone colors, Al's looking great!
</P>
<P>
   Sears, a PhD biochemist and pointedly not ``Dr. Sears'' to some
panel members, followed Atkins with his Zone defense. He even
offered up his ``Zone pyramid,'' which will probably not replace
the USDA's own ``pyramid'' of healthy foods anytime soon. Then the
sugar guy weighed in, followed by some lesser lights who offered
common-sense advice like ``you have to burn more calories than you
eat.'' They were duly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Comes now Dr. John McDougall, a veggie diet author who runs a
fat farm in California's Napa Valley. He dared to call the Atkins,
Sears, and Sugar Busters diets the ``make yourself sick diets.''
``You can't stay on these diets forever, because you can't stay
sick or hungry forever,'' he said, to the evident delight of the
crowded auditorium. Furthermore, he dared to praise the humble
potato as an efficient source of nutrition, and he reminded the
audience that consumers of the starch-based Asian and Mediterranean
diets look pretty good in bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   You can download the debate from the ``video highlights'' on the
USDA Web site, www.usda.gov, or send away for the $20 video from
vidtrans(at)erols.com. Alex's handy watching tip: Fast-forward to
the 2 1/2-hour mark, because that's when the real action begins.
Atkins trots out a Rent-a-Doc who announces some astonishingly
inconclusive ``research'' results about the diet revolution. Soon
afterwards, Ornish blasts the ``toxic'' diets of Atkins and Sears.
``I am not aware of any studies that Dr. Atkins or Dr. Sears have
published in any peer-reviewed journal, about anything, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Sears points out that two of the subjects of a vaunted
Ornish study died of heart attacks _ whose diet is toxic now, Mr.
Smart Guy? Somewhere, Mencken is smiling.

 LOS ANGELES: ... traffic controllers.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fairy dust and a magic wand will not cure the air traffic
control issues plaguing El Toro,'' Russell wrote in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Orange County voters will be asked whether they
support a ballot question that would require a two-thirds vote of
the population for any airport, landfill, or jail to be built
within the county.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that it is likely the measure will pass.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure passes, airport proponents will probably
challenge the legality of the ballot measure. But no El Toro will
exacerbate demand at LAX, which is already bursting.
</P>
<P>
   The airport had its last major modernization for the 1984
Olympics, when 30 million passengers went through the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern California Association of Governments has estimated
that about 160 million passengers will use the region's major
airports by 2020, with about 29 million using Orange County
airports, either John Wayne or El Toro, and about 98 million using
LAX.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition to a fifth runway at LAX prompted Mayor Richard
Riordan last summer to put forward a proposal with no new runway,
but new terminals. The proposal included more than $3 billion in
ground transportation improvements, including an airport ring road,
a connection to the interstate system, and an extension of a rapid
transit line to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   That plan _ which anticipates a major airport at El Toro _ would
limit LAX growth to about 89 million passengers and aircraft
operations would increase by only 5 percent instead of 25 percent
with a new runway. In order to handle that increase, LAX may have
to reduce the commuter flights _ about one-third of its operations
but only 6 percent of the passenger count, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reduce congestion at LAX, the airport hopes to
award a design contract at its next board meeting for an offsite
terminal at a park-and-ride lot in Van Nuys used by 700,000
passengers a year who are bused to the airport. Under the proposal,
passengers would check their baggage at Van Nuys, receive a
boarding pass, and proceed directly to their gates.
</P>
<P>
   Logan, which has a similar network of buses from suburban
locations, has no immediate plans to check the baggage of bus
passengers at remote locations, but ticketing is available.
However, airlines have not been quick to offer that service.
</P>
<P>
   As delays increase and cost America billions of dollars in lost
productivity, the FAA is working hard to improve the air traffic
control system with technology like global positioning systems.
</P>
<P>
   At San Francisco, where low visibility reduces airport capacity
to a single runway instead of two, one plan is to move a runway
into the bay to increase separation and thus permit simultaneous
landings in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   However, United Airlines and the airport are looking at
technology in the cockpit to increase pilot awareness of other
planes in the area. That could improve the delays at San Francisco
when the cloud ceiling begins to drop, said Marchi of the Airports
Council International.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I find telling in all this,'' said Marchi, ``is
that it is the airports and carriers trying to develop new
procedures. The FAA is more reactive. They will approve things, but
they are not taking the lead in Boston and elsewhere saying, `What
can we do to increase capacity?' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT THEY'RE DOING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston:
</P>
<P>
   Wants to build a 5,000-foot commuter runway, with planes taking
off and landing over the water. Would require no taking of
property. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles:
</P>
<P>
   Has several expansion proposals, including three which would
build a fifth runway. One proposal does not call for building an
additional runway, but lengthens an existing one and adds taxiways.
Project involves buyout of some residential and commercial
property. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   Proposal in early stages to build a fifth runway, out into San
Francisco Bay. Designs include floating structure, filling the bay,
or building on concrete pilings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miami:
</P>
<P>
   Is planning to build a new fourth runway as part of a $5.4
billion expansion. Officials say it will increase airport capacity
by 22 percent. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle:
</P>
<P>
   FAA has approved a third runway, and the $773 million project is
expected to be complete by 2006. Project requires the taking of
homes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In San Francisco, no person is an island, not
even a member of that smallest of local identity groups, persons of
Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   My conspiracy to undo George W. Bush by registering Republican
not only failed miserably on Tuesday, but I was outed as a fake
Republican in the worst of all possible places _ a gun store.
</P>
<P>
   I was in Marin County, the beautiful landscape God created to
hold up the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge, finding a gun
dealer so I could get a couple of my family's antique guns moved
from Massachusetts to California for use as decor statements to
stimulate conversation with Bambi huggers.
</P>
<P>
   A woman with a .25 caliber semiautomatic in her hand said, ``You
look familiar. Aren't you the Democratic columnist who became a
Republican to mess us up?''
</P>
<P>
   I did some fast talking, and she turned out to be a very nice
woman who politely gave me a lecture about my responsibilities as a
journalist and a citizen. She also told me how hard it is to be a
pro-gun Republican in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invite my Democratic neighbors to dinner, and pretty soon
they aren't talking,'' she said. ``So I just feed them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing. Most Republicans and most gun owners are
terrific people, but in San Francisco and surrounding counties
they're often treated like subhumans.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't often you'll find a columnist conceding he made
mistakes, but I shouldn't have joined a political party just to
throw a monkey wrench into its works.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not just saying that because there's a lady with a Colt
who knows what I look like.
</P>
<P>
   No person is an island, not even a guy who can write pretty much
whatever he wants down the length of a newspaper page.
</P>
<P>
   I gained nothing from abandoning my lifelong love-hate
relationship with the Democratic Party but a couple of cheap
columns and the ability to make conversation with my conservative
cousin Sally by telling her I'd registered Republican.
</P>
<P>
   She thought I'd finally matured, but I hadn't. I was just
playing games.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the primary in California is over, I feel like my
close-mouthed New England parents, who never would tell me who they
voted for, even though I knew perfectly well it wasn't Barry
Goldwater or Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   No, I won't say who I voted for, except he beat Bush in San
Francisco but lost nationally _ and before his near-concession
speech told Maria Shriver, the wife of the Terminator, to get out
of his way.
</P>
<P>
   In the island-nation of San Francisco, we love gutsy and
slightly crazy losing causes, but don't push me on why I voted for
such a conservative one.
</P>
<P>
   It was for all the wrong reasons, and it was time to get back to
the liberal fantasy island.
</P>
<P>
   There I was listening to the millions of therms of natural gas
released by politicians and pundits on CNN and MSNBC. San Francisco
Mayor Willie Brown was talking about how he's spent thousands on
his wardrobe, and Al Gore has outdone him with a lousy earth-tone
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   That's our island mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Republican analyst Mary Matalin was talking about independents
and Democrats who voted for McCain, and said, ``They weren't
crossovers. They were cross-dressers.''
</P>
<P>
   I assume this wasn't a homophobic joke, but a reference to
wolves in sheep drag. Still, her use of ``cross-dresser'' as a
negative word made me realize how different it is inside the
Beltway vs. inside the isle of Yerba Buena.
</P>
<P>
   I headed immediately for the ``victory party'' of the No on
Knight campaign, the group that organized to fight state Sen.
William ``Pete'' Knight's Proposition 22, which would forbid the
legal recognition of gay and lesbian marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The No on Knight campaign got its butt kicked, but that never
shut down a good victory party in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While Knight and his friends whooped it up in a Sacramento hotel
room, the Green Room at the War Memorial Building rocked with a DJ
playing Aretha Franklin and gay leaders giving some of the best
we-didn't-really-lose speeches I've ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   No on Knight chairman Mike Marshall and San Francisco Supervisor
Mark Leno both made the point that the pro-Knight people were
careful not to bash gays, but recognized their humanity _ all
except their human urge to marry.
</P>
<P>
   This represents progress since the blatantly gay-baiting Briggs
Initiative of 1978. As Leno told me, ``It's a whole new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is. Five potential San Francisco mayors _ Leno, Kevin
Shelley, Carole Migden, Tom Ammiano and Susan Leal _ circulated
through the party celebrating a campaign against the Knight
initiative that raised $6 million, brought positive attention to
gay families and won the endorsement of almost every newspaper in
California.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing surprising about politicians on this island
supporting gay causes. The TVs in the Green Room were what opened
my eyes. Before the returns came in, they were tuned to ``Will and
Grace,'' an NBC television show about gays and the straights who
love them.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me there would be such a sitcom without Harvey Milk. Yes,
San Francisco is an island, but like Great Britain its influence is
disproportionate to its size. And we're democrats who love our
monarchs.
</P>

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thank heavens they come but once a year and I
have to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge to get them. Otherwise,
I'd weigh 300 pounds and need semi-annual bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about frittelle. Six years ago, on a winter trip to
Venice, Italy, I encountered a pastry that affected me as no other
had.
</P>
<P>
   Not big on desserts, I rarely meet a cake, pie, tart or creme
brulee that tempts me past a couple of bites. But, as I confessed
in a 1995 travel piece:
</P>
<P>
   ``After my first frittelle, with marsala wine-laced zabaglione,
I realized I had at last found the foodstuff that could kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Frittelle are lime-sized lumps of cream puff dough (eggs, flour,
water, butter, sugar) that are pastry piped into hot peanut or
canola oil and quickly deep-fried (about three minutes to a side).
</P>
<P>
   Three times bigger after they cook, the frittelle are allowed to
cool, then infused with zabaglione or fruit filling and dusted with
powdered or granulated sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Some people describe them as ultra-light donuts without holes.
All I know is, after I ate that first one, I walked around Venice
for a week consuming frittelle as if they were breath mints. It was
scary.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, in the ensuing years, two things have worked in
favor of me keeping my arteries open and my dress size an 8.
</P>
<P>
   1. Frittelle are strictly seasonal. They're made only during the
weeks that separate the Feast of the Epiphany in early January from
the commencement of Lent on Ash Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   2. I couldn't find them anywhere outside of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, life changed.
</P>
<P>
   A friend phoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell for sure because they were closed, but it
looks like they have frittelle in Emporio Rulli,'' he said. ``I
thought you'd want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as soon as I could get away from my office, I
drove over the bridge to Larkspur. I've always liked Rulli because
it looks and smells exactly like an elegant, old Italian
pasticceria _ all polished dark wood, brass, gold-lettered plate
glass and marble.
</P>
<P>
   It looks this way because its owner, Gary Rulli, has imported
every piece of the place from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-born, Rulli picked up the ABCs of Italian baking
in the early 1980s at the legendary Victoria Pastry Co., in North
Beach. Then he moved to Italy for a few years and got really
serious. Each year he returns to find out what's new and to
continue to learn from the aging pastry masters.
</P>
<P>
   With three staff bakers, Rulli produces dozens of traditional
Italian pastries, such as ventaglia and budino di riso, each day.
Dedicated to authenticity, he also turns out specialties, such as
pannini della quaresima (Easter hot-cross buns) and chocolate,
walnut and raisin pannetone _ paradiso _ at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in and say, `These are fantastic! Why don't you
make them all year-round?' But that would ruin it,'' Rulli said.
``I think the seasonal aspect makes it more interesting and fun,
something you look forward to. If we made them all year-round, they
wouldn't be special anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it was frittelle we were talking about, I would have to
sell my house and move to the only shelter I'd fit in: a dirigible
hangar.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, what my friend saw through the window of Rulli
was not frittelle, but its chunkier cousin, bomboloni. Also a
pre-Lent specialty, bomboloni look just like frittelle but are made
with denser brioche dough. The result _ at Rulli anyway _ is the
lightest, airiest jelly or custard donut you could ever imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it ain't frittelle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're describing sounds like zeppole,'' said Rulli. ``We
make those for the Feast of St. Joseph on March 19. But they're
much smaller. Bite-sized.''
</P>
<P>
   No, I told him, frittelle are hand-sized. Believe me.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Rulli told me he'd talked to a Venetian pastry
chef about my quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was right. They are like zeppole, fried cream puff dough,''
he said. ``In Milan, they make them small and call them zeppole.
But in Venice, they make them very large and call them frittelle.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Rulli made the hair stand up all over my head and neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I decided I'm going to make up some frittelle on the last
day before Ash Wednesday,'' he said. ``If you want, I'll save you
some.''
</P>
<P>
   God help me. I'll be there when you open, Gary. Meanwhile,
somebody get the dirigible hangar ready.

 &HT;    Where the cowboys go to pray
 &HT;    by Rebecca McEntee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASTROP, Texas _ Way out in the sticks, down a long Highway 20
lined with oaks and empty fields, you take a right on Pleasant
Chapel Road. Before long, there's Walnut Creek Ranch and riding
arena, with a companion pavilion furnished with old church pews and
chairs. People come here to rodeo or rope on Tuesdays, Thursdays
and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, it's Cowboy Church.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, it was in the 30s. The faithful arrived
wrapped in blankets and ponchos, carrying hot dishes filled with
everything from beans and cornbread to raspberry cobbler. Everyone
knew Rusty Edwards, the owner of Walnut Creek Ranch, had been
cooking barbecue since the night before at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dishes went straight onto the stove in the middle of
the pavilion, where the coldest parishioners huddled. There's an
outhouse, horses and donkeys behind the fences, a collection of
horse trailers and a red canvas strung across the back of the
pavilion to block the wind. Smoke rose from the huge pot-bellied
stove, and children munched on doughnuts as they played.
</P>
<P>
   This church started when Pastor Bill Pearson of Manor, his wife
Audrey, and a few others used to pray before penning cattle out at
the ranch years ago, in an old shack used as a cafe (where you can
still get burgers and chicken-fried steak) steadily grew into the
100-member parish that's here today.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30 other Cowboy Churches around the state,
and dozens more across the country, according to Christian Cowboy
magazine. Pearson says the interdenominational Penning for Jesus
Cowboy Church, Inc. is different from the rest. He doesn't know
why, but God just lets them come together each in their different
ways. For instance, he says, there are no set guidelines to operate
the different fellowships.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pastor Bill's white horse trailer _ with ``Penning for
Jesus'' painted on the side and ``Have Bible Will Travel'' on the
back _ brings sound and videotaping equipment to the pavilion. W.C.
``Dub'' Simms, in black chaps with fringe, black boots and a black
duster, videotapes the proceedings. (The tapes are available for
sale; cassette tapes of the sermon are mailed off each week to
former church members who have moved elsewhere.) Another black hat
runs the sound. On this particular Sunday, there's no long
preaching because it's Fifth Sunday Singing _ which means a special
music-only service.
</P>
<P>
   Voices and music filled the pavilion and echoed beyond to the
horses and burros in the surrounding fields. The Davis Gospel
Singers came, Charlie Niswonger came to play his saw, and
15-year-old Rick and 9-year-old Katie Barrera gave people chills as
they sang. Glen Drewan, here working on the new jail in a nearby
town, came to sing several pieces. And just before breaking for
grub, 15-year-old Kristal Walden sang as softly as a bird and had
several grown cowboys in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, three cowboys huddled at the back of a truck with a
Bible, immersed in conversation over certain paragraphs in
Galatians. Cowboy Church does have its distractions: Horse-crazy
12-year-old Derean, nicknamed ``Derrick,'' stole away to visit her
favorite horses a few yards away. Some of the boys rested their
voices playing football.
</P>
<P>
   While barbecue settled in bellies, the singing continued into
the afternoon. Some of the crowd was still wrapped in blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Then they hugged and bid their goodbyes, took their covered dish
pans, and started to thin out.

WOULD THAT WE KNEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Freeland e-mailed a while back _ that's journalese for
``more months ago than I want to say'' _ asking for help in a
dispute. Is it correct, he wondered, to say ``I would hope we'll
have this legislation passed before the break''? His friend thinks
I would hope is just as acceptable as I would like, he wrote, ``but
I think it should be I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it should be I should hope. That's the question the
usage authorities have worried to near-extinction over the past
century or two _ when to use shall and should, when will and would.
Anyone who wants to explore that quagmire will find willing guides;
Fowler (1926) is a good place to start, and perhaps to stop. (To
Fowler's ear, I would like was unidiomatic and redundant, since
would repeated the volition already inherent in like; I should like
was the proper version. Are you having fun yet?)
</P>
<P>
   But on the question Freeland poses _ why use I would hope when
the simple I hope says the same thing _ the language commentariat
is remarkably reticent. Once the basic grammar has been outlined _
don't say if I would have known, and so on _ the authorities
abandon these conditional constructions to the realm of rhetoric
and etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   And that may be the right call. Freeland's example _ I would
hope we'll have this legislation passed _ can mean different
things, but the meanings depend on context and delivery, not on
grammar. A senator might say it with a low-key delivery and a
skeptical eyebrow; the message would be ``I hope, but I'm by no
means confident, though of course I am doing all I can.'' Or he
might state it emphatically _ ``I would HOPE'' _ meaning ``It
should be a simple matter, but those cowardly foot-draggers in the
other party won't let it proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   (The I would hope locution, incidentally, is one of the few in
which Americans still often use I should: ``Lucy's doing the dishes
before she leaves.'' ``Well, I should hope so!'' That is, it's the
least she can do if we let her go out on a school night.)
</P>
<P>
   And political nuances are only the beginning. You'd like to
offer dessert? Let us count the ways. To a toddler just mastering
the language, you offer a simple interrogative: Do you want another
cookie? To anyone older, it's Would you like another cookie?
(Though that ``another'' would have been rude, once upon a time;
hosts were not supposed to notice which guests were wolfing down
the pork chops, and the polite way to offer seconds and thirds was
simply ``Will you have a pork chop?'')
</P>
<P>
   Among strangers or honored guests, more layers of caution or
deference may be appropriate. You want to ask the neighbors to turn
down the music, but you don't know how they'll take your request.
So you say Would you mind turning down the volume? Or I wonder if
you'd mind turning down the volume? Or, if you're really anxious, I
wonder if you wouldn't mind turning down the volume? (Though if
you're this worried, maybe you should just call the police.)
</P>
<P>
   Double negatives are not incorrect here; the more layers of
hesitancy, the more polite the request. In early editions of her
famous etiquette book, Emily Post decreed that the polite way for a
sleepy houseguest to address his hostess was, ``I wonder whether
you would mind very much if I went to bed?''
</P>
<P>
   To carry it one step further, you can use what David Crystal, in
the Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, calls the
attitudinal past. Switching from present to past, he notes,
``reflects a tentative state of mind, giving a more polite
effect''; Did you want to leave is less pushy than Do you want to
leave. So for the full Monty, as it were, of linguistic deference,
you could say I was wondering if you wouldn't mind turning down the
volume a bit.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound ludicrously overcivilized, especially if you're
expecting an answer in words of one syllable. But you probably hear
variations on the theme more than you think, starting with I would
hope. And though I would like to offer an authoritative rule, I
can't tell you when to skip the would. If it's there, the speaker
has a use for it. It may be an ignoble use, like evading
responsibility, but in rhetoric as in politics, you go with the
strategy that works.

   Before they have even gotten off the ground, the new Nitro Girls
have already lost a member. Skye, who is also Miss Hancock, will be
leaving the Nitro Girls to work more with her new character that

   Speaking of women troubles, the red-hot rumor of the week is
that the WWF's favorite busty EMT, Barbara Bush, will get her

   While Bush may be on the way out, WWF officials are trying to
find a place for Mideon. Mideon's acting job as the fake Mankind
last month opened their eyes to his talent and could result in the
new gimmick soon.
</P>
<P>
   WCW's woes were increased when the official buy rate for the
most recent pay-per-view were announced. ``Superbrawl'' pulled in
about 250,000 buyers _ one of the least watched pay-per-views in
WCW history.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles for the struggling organization continued when Terry
Taylor, the man who has run the booking committee and wrote the
television scripts for the past two months, stepped down from his
role on the booking committee. He is expected to spend more time
concentrating on the road agent aspects of his job. Taylor has been
the bridge from the end of the Vince Russo reign and the fallout of
the Kevin Sullivan reign.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Madden stated on ``WCW Live'' recently that the Macho Man
Randy Savage's valet and girlfriend, Gorgeous George, has been busy
working strip clubs across the country during her time away from
WCW. Savage's contract with WCW is to expire soon, as well as his
career, as he doesn't seem to have a role in the WWF and is too
expensive for ECW. So fans may not see George in the ring, but I'm
sure they'd settle for the strip club near them.
</P>
<P>
   Although his wife, Luna, was fired, Gangrel remains in the WWF,
although any shot at the top has been put on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   Despite serious injuries, Bret Hart and Kevin Nash will be with
WCW during their European swing this week. Neither will wrestle
though.
</P>
<P>
   An update on ECW's ``Hardcore Revolution'' video game: Acclaim
Entertainment announced that the game had climbed the charts in
just two days to become the No. 2-selling video game on the
PlayStation and No. 6 on Nintendo 64. ``We are very pleased with
the initial response to ECW: Hardcore Revolution,'' said Brad
Loucks, vice president of Acclaim sales. ``We have already sold
over 600,000 units, and have received reorders from virtually every
major retailer.''
</P>
<P>
   Many different Internet reports are that the WCW contacted
Mexican wrestlers El Dandy and Silver King about working some
matches for the company. Many wrestlers believe that they were
called only because of Sonny Onoo's racial discrimination lawsuit
against WCW.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot rumor spreading across the Internet is that Hulk
Hogan will have the WCW world title around his waist before April.
That would build to a Hogan vs. Goldberg matchup in mid-April.
Something will happen soon because WCW is staring at a Sid
Vicious-Jeff Jarrett main event at their ``Uncensored''
pay-per-view, which promises to be one of the worst pay-per-view
main events ever. Despite their age, Hogan, Ric Flair and Terry
Funk seem to draw the most interest in their story lines from the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   One of those young wrestlers who can't stay healthy is Buff
Bagwell. With his WCW contract set to expire March 31, he has
reportedly asked for a seven-figure renewal, and if he doesn't get
it, he will definitely quit WCW. One problem to that scenerio:
Where is he going to go to get that kind of money? With the recent
signings of Chris Benoit, Perry Saturn, Dean Malenko and Eddy
Guerrero, the WWF has stocked its roster with plenty of young
talent and Bagwell's gimmick is just like The Rock's, with less
appeal. ECW is too rough for Bagwell, who's pretty boy image
wouldn't work in the rough and tumble ECW, plus they don't have the
kind of money he wants. So, it looks like Bagwell will stay and
won't be getting a pay raise. While having trouble finding a
position in the WWF, Vic Grimes has found his niche while on loan
to the ECW. Grimes has been involved in some nasty matches, even by
ECW standards, and seems to be more than willing to crash through
the wall or table or chair to get the job done. His recent
Exploding Death Match with Balls Mahoney could go down in ECW
infamy.
</P>
<P>
   The television ratings war isn't much of a battle anymore. The
last Monday in Feb. saw Raw gain a 6.5 rating compared to Nitro's
2.6. In the head-to-head hour it was Raw with a 6.5 to 2.2
advantage.

 &HT;    No justice, no piece of the WCW pie
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a case that's all about civil rights _ and lefts,
piledrivers and body slams.
</P>
<P>
   Three B-list pro wrestlers are suing Atlanta-based World
Championship Wrestling, claiming they were denied protections that
even extend to big guys in shiny spandex costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby ``Hard Work'' Walker, Kazuo ``Sonny'' Onoo and Harrison
``Hardbody'' Norris contend that WCW paid them less than white
performers and failed to promote them on nationally televised
shows. They also claim that WCW based their characters on negative
racial stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A message needs to be sent that this is the year 2000, and WCW
should stop treating us like this is the 1960s,'' says Walker, an
African-American with melon-sized biceps who talks like Mr. T. on
Quaaludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want young black kids to know that they have the same
chance to grow up and see their face on a T-shirt or on a doll as
any white kid,'' declares Norris, who wears a bleached blond
hightop haircut with his nickname carved neatly in the back.
``That's what I'm fighting for.''
</P>
<P>
   The three men's complaints were filed in U.S. District Court on
Feb. 11. The Atlanta-based WCW, a subsidiary of Time-Warner's
Turner Broadcasting System, has until March 27 to respond. Alan
Sharp, a spokesman for the WCW, declined to discuss the suits for
this story.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestlers are being represented by Meadows, Ichter &AMP; Trigg,
a buttoned-down Atlanta law firm where former state Attorney
General Mike Bowers is a partner. A Republican candidate for
governor in 1998, Bowers ran on a platform that sought to end
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't faze the pugilist plaintiffs, who see their case as
an issue of basic workplace fairness, not quotas. Besides claiming
discrimination, the wrestlers, who were contract workers, say they
were improperly denied full-time employee benefits such as vacation
and sick time.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a Fayetteville, Ga., resident who still works for WCW,
complains that if not for racism, he could be ``a babyface who got
pushed'' _ wrestling argot for a heavily promoted performer who
gets plenty of TV appearances. Instead, the wrestlers claim they
have languished as bad-guy props to be kicked around by mostly
white A-list wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``WCW told me there me there weren't enough black people
watching wrestling to push me,'' says Walker. ``If that's true,
it's only because there aren't enough black wrestlers for fans to
follow. ''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, the WCW spokesman, says 87 percent of the league's fans
are white, somewhat more than the nation as a whole, which is 83
percent white. Deciding who gets pushed is not a matter of race,
but of appeal, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro wrestling is an extremely competitive business, and every
athlete does not always succeed,'' Sharp says. ``There are many
factors involved in wrestling, and often those who are successful
posses a wide variety of talents including athleticism, wrestling
ability, interview skills, and charisma. Everything counts.''
</P>
<P>
   During his six-year stint, Onoo, who is Japanese, often played
``a heel'' _ a bad guy in wrestling jargon. When WCW gave him a
pink slip last fall he was making $160,000, about half the $300,000
annual salary Sharp said the average wrestler earns.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive ex-karate champion says while he was upset about
the pay disparity, he was even more offended that Asians, Mexicans
and other minorities were also written off as heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think TV can enhance the stereotype, or enlighten people
about stereotypes,'' Onoo says. ``WCW only showed one side. If they
were creative enough, they could have also portrayed the positive
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Agrees Walker: ``We've been busting our butts to get where we're
at, and we don't want to be labeled as bad guys all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp declines to provide the racial and ethnic makeup of the
WCW roster. The league does have at least two African-American
headliners, who've played both heels and good guys. But, unlike
white wrestlers, they go by a team nickname that evokes a racial
stereotype: Harlem Heat. The best-known black wrestler in the rival
World Wrestling Federation, the ``Godfather,'' plays a flamboyant
pimp.
</P>
<P>
   Onoo, who now lives in Iowa, complains that there were no
minority writers at WCW when he was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time they started arguing with me about the
term 'Japs,''' recalls Onoo. ``They said it was short for
'Japanese.' I don't know if that's racist, but I told them it was
ignorant and pointed out that it was offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending a WCW-sponsored diversity training session for
its staff last year, Onoo recalls asking the human-resources
manager: ``What good is having a diverse work force if the person
who puts the show together is always a middle-aged, white American
man?''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow plaintiff ``Hardbody'' Norris also claims his race kept
him from becoming a WCW babyface. Norris, who is black, says his
pro career began after he left the Army in 1994, and two years
later answered an ad for tryouts at the Power Plant, the WCW-owned
training facility in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Norris said he paid the $3,500 admission fee, but after
finishing the course he was not signed to a long-term contract as
he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he wound up competing in ``crush matches'' where he was
usually cast as a hapless loser and paid $150 _ an amount he says
didn't cover his expenses. Norris says he was also required to
train less-experienced wrestlers, and to work as an equipment
handler before and after shows, although he was not compensated.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Norris was offered a six-month contract and
appeared in a handful of televised matches, he says. After his
contract expired, WCW let him go. Since then, Norris, who lives in
Kennesaw, Ga., has been competing in no-holds-barred Toughman
competitions to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself lost in the shuffle, I was slid into slavery,''
he says. ``They told me they weren't hiring, but I kept seeing all
these other white guys coming in getting contracts and leapfrogging
past me.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrestlers's suits come at a time when the television
industry is under the microscope for its minority-casting
practices. The NAACP and other groups have charged that TV is too
white, that when minorities do appear, they are usually in niche
shows geared to minorities or in secondary roles in more popular
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell Hunt, director of African-American Studies at the
University of Southern California, is working with the Screen
Actors Guild to examine the roles of minorities on television
sitcoms, dramas, and fantasy/action programs _ including pro
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minorities in general are way underrepresented on these
shows,'' Hunt maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the goofiness _ some would say violent stupidity _ of pro
wrestling may make it less likely that philosophical allies will
come forward for Walker, Onoo and Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of some of the stereotypical roles the characters
play,'' Hunt says, ``I'm not sure whether it's a good thing or a
bad thing to be represented in professional wrestling at all.''

&HT;     NOT ALL DISCRIMINATION IS BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DONALD G. SMITH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA, Calif. _ With all the political correctness crammed
down our throats since the Great Society years, probably no word
has been so misused as
</P>
<P>
   ``discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   While the practice of discrimination can, in some cases, be
undesirable, we cannot throw an all-inclusive blanket over the
entire concept and declare it an evil thing.
</P>
<P>
   There is, indeed, good discrimination. And there is a purity
about the word that elevates us above the level of the beasts in
the field. Civilized people discriminate, and this is the very
reason that they are civilized.
</P>
<P>
   I would not, for example, choose my friends from the ranks of
those who sell dope on the street, expose themselves in public
playgrounds or pray for the soul of Adolf Hitler to rise from the
dead and lead us all to glory. Nor would I be enthusiastic about
furthering an acquaintance with those who park old cars in their
front yards or include obscene T-shirts among their regular
apparel.
</P>
<P>
   This is discrimination in every sense of the word, but I cannot
list it in the evil column.
</P>
<P>
   There is actually no reason for an organization to exist if it
does not discriminate. Associations, clubs and professional
societies exist solely to bring together people of similar
mentality or type. This includes not only common interest but age,
gender, education, religious belief and even physical dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In scanning a list of national organizations, I have noted more
than 60 that would not allow me to join. A few of these would be:
the Reserve Officers Association of the United States, American
Veterinary Medical Association, Screen Actors Guild, Knights of
Columbus, Professional Photographers of America, National
Association of Female Executives, National Federation of Federal
Employees, B'Nai B'Rith International, Catholic Daughters of the
Americas and Jewish War Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the accredited colleges and universities in this country,
I would only be allowed in two alumni associations: Cal State Los
Angeles and UCLA. The rest would not have me in their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The point to all of this is that we cannot declare that we are
against discrimination and be done with it. The best that a
reasonable person can do is oppose the idea in highly specific
cases involving drinking fountains, restrooms and the use of public
parks and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't collect stamps, they don't want you in the stamp
club. It is as simple as that. It is discrimination, of course, but
please tell me what is wrong with it.
</P>

CUBICLES MAY NOT SQUARE WITH WORKERS' NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If American bosses want more employees to think outside the box,
they may have to give them a different box _ or maybe no box at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The drab cubicle, according to new research, is stifling the
creativity and memory of workers. In what perhaps is a no-brainer
to the Dilberts of today, psychologists and designers say the
solution is new work spaces that will spark people's mental wiring.
</P>
<P>
   In this new field called ``cognitive ergonomics'' researchers
are talking about everything from transparent cubicle walls to
bendable desk accessories. They're questioning the value of office
plants and reassessing the corporate contempt for the messy desk.
</P>
<P>
   And they are debating the bias among modern-day designers for
open spaces and neutral colors in the wake of studies showing that
employees often complain their workplaces are too noisy or too
bland.
</P>
<P>
   While cognitive ergonomics may sound suspiciously like corporate
mind-control _ or even an attempt to sell more office furniture by
giving it a new look _ the field has attracted enthusiasts who say
it comes at a crucial time when employees are being asked to work
harder and take on more challenging work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work has changed, but workplaces haven't changed with it,''
said Ellen Keable, a senior associate at the Buffalo Organization
for Social and Technology Innovation in New York, a consulting firm
for workplace issues.
</P>
<P>
   Some local companies are trying to change with the times. Terry
Kleiman, who is in charge of renovating space for the global
marketing division of the Boston Consulting Group, said firms like
hers take seriously the new research about how individual work
spaces affect productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The people in her unit, she said, often log more than 55 hours a
week. ``It's critical that people can personalize their space and
control it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideas go beyond the conventional ergonomic issues, such as
what chairs reduce back strain and what keyboards help workers
avoid repetitive stress injuries. And as many universities as
office-furniture companies are sponsoring research in this new
field, which is all about how work spaces can be tailored to meet
each person's thinking style.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as something that works for everybody,''
said Alan Hedge, a professor of environmental analysis at Cornell
University in Ithaca, N.Y. ``Not everybody stores and processes
information in the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedge pointed to considerable research done into the mind-set of
the messy desk.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest work was performed in the 1980s when Thomas Malone
of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in California divided
employees into ``pilers'' (messy desk) and ``filers'' (clean desk).
He found pilers were better retrievers of information than one
might think _ some could quickly pluck a particular memo from a
chaotic stack. Researchers also learned that the piles of paper
served as visual reminders of what tasks to do.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth Inc. of Holland, Mich., one of the nation's largest
office furniture makers, has taken this research further and, in
the past few years, conducted its own study of desk tidiness. It
found that many people are mentally wired to more readily recall
papers when they were placed in vertical, rather than horizontal,
arrangements. Also, varying the shapes, sizes, and angles of desk
accessories _ something the company did in its new ``Jump Stuff''
desk-accessory line _ also helped some people better remember where
they put things.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person's desk may look like it's in disarray,'' said Jeff
Reuschel, who works in product design along with a full-time
cognitive psychologist at Haworth. ``But there may be an intent
behind the messiness.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also the importance of visual cues in activating
people's minds. James Wise, who spent three decades as a professor
of industrial design and psychology, pointed to a survey of
students who took tests in two rooms _ one where the information
was learned and one in another room. Students scored higher when
their test-taking was done in the same room they where first
learned the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are able to use the visual cues (in the room) to unlock
those items held in memory,'' said Wise, who is now a business
consultant in Richland, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Wise further suggests the best visual cues for humans are things
and patterns that mimic nature, a way of plugging into our
biological past. In any event, he said, the corner of an
8-by-8-foot cubicle is perhaps the worst visual trigger for human
brains, and companies looking to improve creativity and
productivity ought to give workers good things to see.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, not everyone can get a window view of Boston
Harbor _ nor should they. Paul Cornell, director of human factors
and cognitive environment for Steelcase Inc. in Grand Rapids,
Mich., another big office-furniture maker, said work spaces with
open, rich scenery may help employees when they're straining for an
innovative thought, or one of those ``crack-the-nut'' moments. But
not, perhaps, when they are trying to concentrate on writing or
number-crunching.
</P>
<P>
   Keable, of the Buffalo workplace consulting firm, said peace and
quiet was the top priority of 12,000 employees who took part in one
of its recent six-year studies. She interprets the survey result as
a reaction to the modern-day designers who push the wide-open look
as a symbol of employee collaboration. ``It flies in the face of a
lot of design wisdom, which is `let's take all the walls down,' ''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps distraction is a factor in a study called ``Plants in
the Workplace,'' published by the journal ``Environment and
Behavior'' in May 1998. Research done at the University of Illinois
looked at how 80 people performed on a test of lettered
identification and sorting while spending time in an office with no
plants, some plants, or many plants.
</P>
<P>
   While people most disliked the looks of the plant-less offices,
they actually did the best on the test. The worst performers were
those in the room with the most plants, even though they liked the
appearance of those rooms the most.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noted that the test-takers were doing routine and
repetitive tasks. Apparently loath to dismiss the value of plants,
they concluded that more work needs to be done on whether plants
may ``promote human creativity'' but just aren't good for work
involving ``repetitive action.''
</P>
<P>
   A common theme in many studies is the benefit of allowing
employees to personalize their work spaces with decorations and
creature comforts. A study by Walter Kroner, a professor of
architecture at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.,
showed increased productivity when 400 employees of an insurance
company were given control over things like lighting, temperature,
and air flow.
</P>
<P>
   If a worker is fated to remain in a gray cubicle for now, he or
she can still do things to improve his or her mental environment,
said Fritz Steele, a Brookline organizational behavior consultant.
He suggested the workers make conscious choices of where they sit
and what they see. Is the view a distraction or an energy-enhancer?
And employees should think about adding a desk lamp or organizing
papers differently, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Adams, creator of the comic-strip cubicle-dweller Dilbert,
said that almost anything that alters workplace sterility is a good
thing. He toiled away in cubicles in corporate settings for more
than a decade before becoming a work-at-home cartoonist. Cubicles
are about cheapness, he said, not worker happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that makes our work spaces less like a cubicle can
only be a good thing,'' he said. ``How can you expect people to be
creative in a box?''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACIENDA HEIGHTS, Calif. -- In August, when the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles starts to bore the media horde,
the largest Buddhist temple in North America will be the most
photographed. Television crews will zero in on the site of Al
Gore's most notorious fund-raiser, the Hsi Lai Temple, in the hills
of this quiet town of 52,000.
</P>
<P>
   This leafy corner of Los Angeles County, the incubator of
``sunset'' legislation and term limits, once symbolized Republican
rule in Ozzie-and-Harriet land, the vast white-bread housing tract
known as Southern California. Its demographic changes reflect
California's _ and America's _ politics.
</P>
<P>
   Hacienda Heights is also the punchline of a favorite yarn of
Ronald Reagan's, told by one of California's jolliest and savviest
politicians. Bill Campbell, elected to the California Assembly in
1966 with the help of ``Reagan Democrats,'' went on to the state
Senate, where he was floor leader, until 1990, when he became
president of the California Manufacturers Association and moved to
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Hacienda Heights,'' he told Republican audiences.
``If you want to get there, go east on the Pomona Freeway, then
stop at a supermarket. `No, not here,' you'll say. Then back in the
car and go east again to another shopping center and another
supermarket. `No, not here, either.' Then east again until finally,
when you go into a grocery store and find Velveeta in the gourmet
food section, you'll know you're in Hacienda Heights!''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's timing and style were impeccable. In the 1970s,
Reagan laughed heartily every time. When I once asked him why,
Reagan said, ``I know we've all heard it before, but it's funny
every single time.''
</P>
<P>
   To those audiences, processed cheese was as distasteful as
process liberalism. Campbell's story saluted ``a down-home kind of
a town. It was actually very mixed, with a lot of Latinos and
Asians. Now it's probably more so. It's a suburb where it's hard to
find identifiable boundaries. When I moved there in 1964, there
were a lot of avocado groves and orange trees, now replaced by
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Campbell first introduced ``sunset'' laws, which force
agencies to justify their continued existence. ``It came out of a
Reagan line, `The closest thing to eternal life is a government
agency.' We never got it totally applied to state government, but
at least to new programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Schabarum, for whom a handsome park here is named, led the
successful fight to create a ``citizen legislature,'' limiting
lawmakers to two or three terms, although he served in office more
than 20 years himself.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas reflected the high tide of conservativism. In 1966,
when Reagan unseated Governor Pat Brown, his margin in LA County
matched his statewide total of 57 percent. In neighboring Orange
County, Reagan's total was 72 percent, and in San Diego County, 64
percent. In the 1998 gubernatorial election, Democrat Gray Davis
defeated Republican Dan Lungren by 20 points, winning 66 percent in
LA County.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren barely won Orange County, with 52 percent. In San Diego
County, a lot of retired admirals have switched their voting
addresses to Davy Jones's locker. Davis beat Lungren there by 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the decline in defense spending, we saw a large exodus of
engineers in the late '80s and early '90s,'' Campbell says of his
old hometown. ``There have been some major demographic changes as
well.'' The 2000 Census will likely show a nonwhite majority in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hacienda Heights is unincorporated, statistics are iffy.
But the San Gabriel Valley telephone book documents that 130
Campbells are outnumbered 4-1 by folks named Chavez. Kims and Chens
outnumber people named Smith and Jones. More than 1,200 people
named Hernandez have telephones and 1,300 Garcias.
</P>
<P>
   And when television crews get here and they get hungry, in every
supermarket they'll find a mountain of Velveeta.

MAINE HUNTERS DEBATE `CANNED HUNTS' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AURORA, Maine _ Last spring, when Scotty Lambert's grades had
climbed high enough, his father drove him and two friends from
Brockton, Mass. to this spot east of Bangor, where, inside a
thickly wooded enclosure, he marked his 11th year by killing his
first Russian boar.
</P>
<P>
   The Lamberts left the Hillside Game Ranch with three proud young
archers and three boars ready for butchering, profoundly satisfied
with the ``very realistic'' hunt its proprietor, Scott Beede, had
provided, said Scott Lambert, Scotty's father.
</P>
<P>
   But Beede's business _ the only enclosed hunting area operating
openly in Maine, and one of seven in New England _ has been at the
center of a yearlong debate in Augusta. Several legislators say
``canned hunts'' run counter to the tradition of fair chase, and
are pushing for Maine to join the 12 states that have banned the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The principles here are simple: For $400 each, clients hunting
within two fenced-off areas of more than 200 acres apiece can
typically ``harvest'' a boar within two days, and those who don't
kill anything don't have to pay. A red stag costs at least $1,200,
Corsican rams are $300, and a small elk will set a client back
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   And the hunters come, half from out of state, at the rate of 25
to 60 customers a week, Beede said. Among them are bachelor
parties, father-and-son outings, nature-starved flatlanders, and
traditional New England hunters who are tired of stalking deer
through forests and coming back empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Beede has seen the future of hunting in the North Woods and, he
said, it is significantly more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't have the time to take weeks off and go hunting
and take a chance to get what they're after,'' Beede said. Inside
his fences, ``we have more animals, to make it fairer for the
hunters. Whereas in the wild, the animals have the upper hand.''
</P>
<P>
   To Senator Marge Kilkelly, a Wiscasset Democrat, the enterprise
has no place in Maine. Last year, Kilkelly sponsored a bill to ban
the practice, and her bill should finally come to a vote before the
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee by the end of the
week. Kilkelly said she senses little will in the legislature to
ban closed hunts, but hopes the Committee will create the first set
of guidelines regulating them _ how large the enclosures should be,
for example, or what species are permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there aren't any conditions about fencing and animals,
there's nothing to say someone couldn't bring in hybrid wolves, or
cats from a circus,'' Kilkelly said. ``There's no reason to be sure
that someday we might not be dealing with an escaped tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Kilkelly's bill churned up deep misgivings among
hunters in Maine. Reluctant to condemn any form of hunting on the
grounds of inhumanity, many also allowed that they would never hunt
that way themselves. There are hundreds of game ranches in Texas,
where landowners have always fenced their property. But the notion
of hunting an animal on fenced land is still strange to many in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``In northern New England, the pride is in the chase, not in the
kill,'' said Jeff Brown of Paxton, Mass., who as president of the
Northeast Big Buck Club will not allow members to register deer
killed in enclosed areas. ``When someone creates a situation where
the chase is not an important part of the process, they're
attacking the culture. I'm surprised they even opened a place like
that in Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Beede sees it, the old traditions are crumbling anyway.
Hunters' access to land is diminishing, as more property owners
post their land or sell it to developers. Meanwhile, people have
less time to stalk deer in the woods, especially during hunting
season, which Beede says is too brief. He argues that his business
could keep hunters in the sport who might otherwise drop out.
Without some gratification, he said, ``they'll stop hunting. If you
played a game all the time and never won, wouldn't you get sick of
it? Nobody likes to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   So Beede increases a client's chances of coming home with a
trophy _ while also giving him or her the sense of participating in
a true hunt. Inside a new, 400-acre enclosure he intends to circle
with an eight-foot fence, Beede has left the woods thick and dark,
``to make it a sport.'' Still, he said, about 75 percent of his
clients wouldn't succeed if he didn't help them. ``The bottom line
is, if you've killed, I've done my job, and that makes me happy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Lambert and his son, Scotty, visited the game ranch in
pursuit of boar last March, two of the three boys _ who were all
competitive archers _ sat in a tree stand for two cold days,
nervous and excited, before they could get a clean shot at a boar,
Lambert said. One had to pursue a boar on foot through the brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it seem like an enclosed hunt? No, because we never saw
the fence,'' said Lambert, who recommends Hillside to friends
regularly, in part because it allows hunting during off season.
</P>
<P>
   Beede has some powerful allies among Maine's 80 deer and elk
farmers, whose herds now number between 8,000 and 10,000. They can
sell animals otherwise headed to a slaughterhouse to an
enclosed-hunt business for three or four times what they are worth
as meat. Animals sold to be hunted are likely to live at least
twice as long as those sold for slaughter, said Henry Ahern,
director of the Northeast Deer and Elk Farmers Association. In a
good hunting preserve, where the animals might run free for years
before being ``harvested,'' they will probably have a much better
life than they would otherwise, he said. And if the closed-hunt
business grows _ as it has in other parts of the country _ it
``would probably create quite an opportunity for small family farms
to raise replacement animals,'' said James Neil, who runs a deer
farm in Cornish, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to Kilkelly's bill also has come from hunters worried
that making judgments about the humanity of hunting will come back
to haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would be hypocritical to point fingers at people.
You just bring a firestorm of criticism on hunting in general,''
said state Senator David Trahan, a Republican from Waldoboro. ``I
personally do not like shooting a bear with his head in a bucket
eating a doughnut, but I'm not going to say someone else shouldn't
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   By Kilkelly's own account, her bill was more about hunters'
behavior than animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about Maine's culture and heritage,'' she said.
``This is not who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an argument that resonates with Jim Posewitz, author of
``Beyond Fair Chase: The Ethic and Tradition of Hunting,'' who
recently lobbied unsuccessfully for passage of a similar bill in
Montana. Posewitz sees enclosed hunts as a disturbing privatization
of wildlife. Unlike Europeans, who historically considered game
attached to private property, Americans have always regarded
wildlife as the property of the people. Out of that has grown the
world's most impressive record of wildlife restoration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human beings have already demonstrated that we have the
capacity to liquidate wildlife,'' Posewitz said. ``There has been a
conscious process of restraint that has restored the game in
America. Man has all the advantages. That's why we have this
concept of fair chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the highway from Beede's ranch, at Aurora's general store,
Joni Archer, a cashier, said she supported his right to run the
business on his property. But she also said no hunter from Aurora
would shoot an animal inside a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do that,'' she said. ``We're from Maine.''

BOTH REPUBLICANS WERE LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES -- At the very end _ and this was the end _ it
didn't really matter what the final splits were in the California
and New York primaries, at least not to John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candidacy as a realistic shot at the Republican
presidential nomination ended with a thudding finality when the
remorseless arithmetic of national convention delegates delivered a
final verdict from Super Tuesday's underemphasized core four _
Ohio, Missouri, Maryland, and Georgia. George W. Bush's ability to
put McCain away in the Bush family vacation state of Maine (while
losing its ancestral home in Connecticut) merely supplied the
coffin's last nail.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the real significance of California and New
York was for the contest that began late Tuesday: the general
election. The fissures opened by the McCain-Bush fight and what the
fight showed about the presumptive GOP nominee have helped put two
Electoral College foundation stones of Democratic success back in
place.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush was the all-things-to-all-people, compasionate
conservative governor, he upset all political applecarts and was a
potential force everywhere. When he became the conservative
Republican alley fighter, summoning right-to-lifers in particular
and religious conservatives in general to crush a maverick
challenger with the temerity to pitch at independents and
Democrats, his fortunes on Democratic turf dipped drastically.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-McCain war solidified Al Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire
at first, then in Michigan, Washington state, California, and New
York. Polls are also showing Gore leads in two more swing states
Bush dominated before the campaign really began: Illinois and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still a strong force, but history teaches that this game
is sequential, and so far, when the actual campaign has come to a
November-critical state, Bush, as a conservative, antiabortion,
deep-tax-cut Republican, has not worn well. Most McCain voters were
telling pollsters they were not ready to vote for Bush in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   This was in marked contrast to Bill Bradley's band of brothers.
(His small vote was overwhelmingly concentrated among upscale white
males.) By huge margins, Bradley supporters said they were ready to
swallow Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Unless McCain surprises everyone and goes third party, Bush
faces an immense fence-mending job. In contrast, the Democratic
fence, along with the all-important economy, remains intact.

IN VERMONT, PRAGMATIC PLANNING FOR A UTOPIAN VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. _ They sat around a table last weekend _
the cleareyed lesbian carpenter, the dabbler in Old Order Mennonite
life, the passionate young woodsman, the urban child of divorce,
the cautious, fascinated family of four _ and asked themselves: Are
these the people I want in my utopia?
</P>
<P>
   It was not an idle question. Two months from now, a core group
of members plans to break ground on Meadowdance, an ambitious and,
they hope, long-term experiment in community living.
</P>
<P>
   As its members quit their jobs in other communities and prepare
to move to a stunning hillside in Plainfield, in north central
Vermont, Meadowdance's founders must convince skeptics that the
``intentional community'' they propose is different from the
unstructured communes that frequently self-destructed in the 1960s
and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Still driven by the same idealistic notions _ at Meadowdance
it's ``a child-centered, egalitarian community that welcomes human
diversity, ecological sensibility, mutual learning, and joy'' _
today's utopian visionaries are well aware of attempts that failed,
and resolved to build their worlds more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of people attracted by Meadowdance's Web site came to a
house in this Burlington suburb for a process that is part first
date, part college admission, and part job interview. The mutual
selectivity shows how far the movement has come since the 1960s,
said Laird Schaub, executive secretary of the Fellowship for
Intentional Communities, who likes to say that new communities,
like new restaurants, usually don't live to see their second
birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were communities that started out `hey, y'all come,
you're welcome,' '' said Diana Christian, editor of Communities
magazine. ``I tell new communities: You can't afford to do that.
Choose people as carefully as if you're going to marry them.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekend, the courting featured quantities of organic
macaroni and cheese, an introduction to the power drill, and
extensive powers of visualization. At present, Meadowdance is a
plan, not a place; Plainfield's Planning Commission could still
block the building plans, forcing them to push off their move-in
date by a year.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 adults and children who have committed to the idea have
$140,000 in cash assets and an option to buy the $240,000, 165-acre
parcel of land in Plainfield. They also have a fledgling software
testing firm whose income, they hope, will help pay for
construction of a $500,000 community building, members' food and
health care, and _ down the road _ contribute toward college
tuition for children.
</P>
<P>
   Income will not be shared, but members will be required to allot
an amount of time to work for the community. Although prospective
members will not pay to join Meadowdance, those seeking admission
will undergo a ``financial evaluation that must tell the community
whether or not it can afford to take on a person,'' according to
the group's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Among its nine adult founders are Sue and John Morris, ages 52
and 33, a long-haired couple fond of contra dancing. Sue Morris
describes herself as the collective's ``house grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   The founders would like to start with 20 adults and add a few
people every year to a peak of 75. But with 70 interested visitors
and e-mail correspondents contacting the 3-year-old project, Sue
Morris confesses to being exhausted by the stream of people eager
to be accepted by the community. One woman, intrigued with the
concept presented on the Web site, drove from Connecticut to meet
the Morrises and was so astounded by their appearance that she
blurted out, ``Oh, my God, they're hippies.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, visitors who are not ready to join the group
opt out gracefully. In newer communities that are, like
Meadowdance, actively recruiting members, the task of marketing the
idea and meeting interested parties can be overwhelming. One
community, Dancing Rabbit in Missouri, had 150 visitors last year
and accepted 10 new members. Christian's magazine has coined the
term ``seeker fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Morris, sitting barefoot on a couch, said she tries to take
the comings and goings philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person said to me last night, `I want something more
austere, this is too middle class for me,' '' Morris said. ``In
general, I don't feel hurt about people who don't want to be in
this community, unless,'' she added, ``they're someone I really
like.''
</P>
<P>
   The tables turn as soon as would-be members declare their
intention to become either a provisional ``seeker'' who would live
at Meadowdance for four to six weeks while exploring membership, or
a fully committed ``founding member'' whom the core group would
accept or reject after several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the weekend, Jeff McKenzie asked to be considered
a founding member and climbed back onto a bus for a long ride back
to Gasport, N.Y., near Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, an amiable 45-year-old with a close-cropped beard, is
no stranger to communal living. He once wore the straw hat and
suspenders of the Old Order Mennonites, only to leave when he
finally understood that the sect he had joined believed that only
100 families from Scottsville, Ky., would be admitted to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he journeyed to California to join a 10-month
Peace Walk, but left, disillusioned, after five days with a group
of raucous twentysomethings.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie's search for ``a sense of family'' is remarkably
systematic: In his bag is a letter of introduction detailing his
financial status, work history, and lack of ``special dietary
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is waiting to hear whether he will be accepted at
Meadowdance, McKenzie is planning to visit Twin Oaks, a venerable
Virginia community founded in 1967, and East Wind in Missouri,
where members have shared profits from producing hammocks and
sandals since 1976. Failing those, he's interested in Sandhill
Farm, an eight-person collective in Rutledge, Mo., that hopes to
add four members; Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage, also in Rutledge, a
group of 19 who build their houses ``using alternative techniques
such as straw bale and cob;'' and Acorn Community, an
income-sharing group of 16, seven miles from Twin Oaks in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Quests like McKenzie's have become more sophisticated in recent
years, as information about the communities became centralized. The
new edition of the Fellowship for Intentional Communities'
directory will list 625 groups, up from 325 in 1990 and 540 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more people are looking for an alternative to
``nuclear family life in the suburbs and commuting to and from a
job that they may or may not be interested in,'' as Christian put
it. With a surge of interest, especially from older people whose
children have left home, said the fellowship's Schaub, communities
that may have had vacancies 10 years ago are filling up.
</P>
<P>
   So both seekers and communities are learning to be specific
about what they are looking for. On the fellowship's Web site, one
prospective member posted a desire for landscapes that are ``curvy,
not rectilinear,'' and another requested ``the purposeful absence
of domestic animals and pet animals.'' One group looking for new
members advertised itself as ``clothing-optional,'' with plans for
``a hot tub, yurt, and a self-healing center.''
</P>
<P>
   And many lay out fine gradations of ecological purity, spiritual
principles, or independence from the American monetary system.
``Although we like nature, we are not necessarily into getting off
the grid and outdoor toilets (been there and done that),'' reads
one posting.
</P>
<P>
   Experience _ some of it bitter _ has pushed forward the science
of what makes utopian visions succeed, said Donald Pitzer of the
University of Southern Indiana's Center for Communal Studies. A
wave of academic scholarship has sprung up based on the American
communal experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is a group of people who are much more educated
in what's happened in the past,'' said Pitzer.
</P>
<P>
   But when John Morris recently led a small group of visitors
through thigh-high snow to the hilltop where Meadowdance proposes
to build, nobody was talking about the past. With his ragged
Cornell ski team jacket vivid against the snow, Morris showed them
where founders hope to build their community building, grow apple
trees, and tap a sugarbush for maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Torry, a 25-year-old from western Massachusetts who
dreams of breaking ground on her own organic farm, looked out at
Spruce Mountain and felt her skepticism about Meadowdance's
finances drift away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you notice how ever since I got here I'm saying, `Now what
are we doing?' '' she said, laughing and emphasizing the ``we.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the weekend, two men _ McKenzie and 25-year-old
Chris Chaisson _ had asked to be considered founding members. Three
adults asked to be seekers: Anna Flynn, a 20-year-old who wants to
start a ``free school'' like the one her father helped found in
Massachusetts; Bob Carlson, 46, who saw power struggles sink a
commune he helped found in the 1970s; and Carlson's wife, Franny
Huberman, 27, who hesitates to uproot their two small children from
Gould Farm, a service-based community in Monterey, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the type of person who necessarily easily makes a leap
of faith,'' Huberman said.
</P>
<P>
   For John Morris, like the rest of the founders, doubt is an old
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say it's going to work because I know it
will,'' he said. ``But that's all I can say.''

THE ESTABLISHMENT DIDN'T HAVE TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Campaign 2000 started off with such promise. For once, the smart
money looked stupid.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. The two candidates backed by the establishment _
Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush _ will be
facing off against each other in November.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad. The establishment did not have to win.
</P>
<P>
   People wanted change. But the change agents _ former US Senator
Bill Bradley and Arizona Senator John McCain _ ended up giving them
too much of the same old thing: negative campaigning and hot-button
politics. As soon as Bradley and McCain played by the
establishment's rules, the establishment won back control.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the New Hampshire primary,
Republicans and Democrats talked about ideas and policy, about
health care and Social Security, about campaign finance reform and
national security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people could feel like they were part of the
conversation: the candidates were actually talking about issues
that affect all of us directly.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was the first to cave to conventional wisdom. His
handlers told him to fight back and not take punches from Gore. So
he punched in New Hampshire, calling Gore a liar. The pundits
cheered, but I think Bradley lost his allure with voters when he
gave up the high road.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by his tremendous New Hampshire win, McCain took longer
to follow suit, but follow he did.
</P>
<P>
   After winning New Hampshire, McCain declared that ``a great
national crusade has just begun.'' If only he were able to keep the
crusade alive.
</P>
<P>
   People so wanted a healer and a hero; and McCain, at first,
seemed so perfect for the role. Democrats and Independents were
willing to overlook a conservative Republican agenda to embrace a
candidate who did not want to be all things to all people, but
would stand for some key things everyone could believe in.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the gloss started to wear off. In the weeks leading up
to Super Tuesday, the conversation got narrower on the Republican
side. Trusting either bad advice or bad instincts, McCain did his
part to narrow it further.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones University and anti-Catholicism? Jerry Falwell and the
evangelicals? They may be burning issues on cable talk shows, but
they hardly seem relevant to most people. Religious intolerance is
serious, but this debate was a fraud. It was all about pushing
certain political buttons to get a certain political result. McCain
touched the hot button and burned himself. What a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   And now it leads to the biggest disappointment of all _ Gore W.
Bush.

THE STATUS QUO STEALS THE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential primaries settled one argument, at least.
Americans don't hate politics; it's governance we disdain.
</P>
<P>
   We love a campaign _ especially the nasty, upstart, insurgent
variety _ the way an earlier generation loved a parade.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the protests against negative advertising and the
chest-thumping about soft money. The high school band struck up the
theme from ``Star Wars'' and we were smitten. A paper shower
cloaked the fomer Navy pilot in red, white, and blue confetti and
we got a patriotic surge. The ``Straight Talk Express'' rolled into
town and we couldn't wait to hear whom the irreverent candidate
would skewer next.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted a show and, bless him, Senator John McCain gave us
one. Show's over. Exit stage right.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Democratic counterpart in the maverick role never quite
lived up to advance billing, though. Maybe former New Jersey
senator Bill Bradley's problem was that he came out of the National
Basketball Association in an era when the NBA was still about the
basketball. No cheerleaders. No dancers, blaring rock music, or
gimmicky halftime entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted a show and, shame on him, Bradley refused to give us
one. Exit stage left.
</P>
<P>
   If it's true that we get the leaders we deserve, we deserve the
fall campaign we are about to face between two men who got their
political careers the old-fashioned way: They inherited them from
Dad. For all this primary season's talk of change, we will be
watching a campaign rerun come autumn. A (not too far) left-leaning
Democrat competes for the vast electoral middle against a (genuine)
right-wing Republican. Nothing bold, nothing new there.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George Bush will
agree to some form of campaign spending restrictions now that an
old Gore associate has been convicted of illegal fund-raising and a
current Bush ally has used millions of dollars to bludgeon McCain
with misleading primary ads.
</P>
<P>
   But the chance for real change, the type for which we claim to
hunger every four years, was lost in a wave of Super Tuesday
victories for the standard-bearers of the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the Bradley campaign, especially, confirms a
frightening unwillingness to take ourselves or our politics
seriously. Bradley was too professorial, said critics. He was too
dull. He failed to electrify a crowd. He had no fire in his belly.
Oh, he had good ideas, bold ideas, but his delivery! Didn't the man
ever take public speaking?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ``in a good mood is a worse campaigner than I am in a
bad mood,''smirked Barney Frank, the ever-humble Democratic
congressman from Massachusetts and comedian in chief of the US
House.
</P>
<P>
   Is the ease of campaigning and the ability to lead the same
thing? It is easy to forget how many great presidents, from the
pre-television era, would have failed this kind of personality
litmus test. Abraham Lincoln comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quitter,'' complained Massachusetts Senator John Kerry
of Bradley's decision to leave the Senate after the Republicans
gained control of Congress. ``He left when the rest of us stayed to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the Senate the only place for a public man to advance a
political agenda? It is easy to forget that Bill Bradley was one of
many senators, of both parties, to walk away from secure seats in
``the world's greatest deliberative body'' in the last decade,
exasperated by the procedural stalemates and partisan gridlock that
thwarted even the most benign public policy goals. Maine Democrat
George Mitchell comes to mind. (So do Maine Republican William
Cohen, New Hampshire Republican Warren Rudman, Oregon Republican
Mark Hatfield, Kansas Republican Nancy Kassebaum, and Georgia
Democrat Sam Nunn.)
</P>
<P>
   ``My frustration with our inability to deal with things in
Congress is as frustrating as hell,'' Rudman said when he announced
his retirement in 1992. ``It seems that we can't work together
anymore. The president tries to do things. The Congress tries to do
things. The Democrats fight with the Republicans. The Republicans
fight with the Democrats. Everybody fights with everybody else, and
I sometimes wonder what the hell I'm doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that it was Rudman who stage-managed McCain's
insurgent campaign for change? The final curtain came down Tuesday.
Next up: Politics as usual.

AMBASSADOR MONEYBAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year San Francisco businessman and philanthropist James
Hormel was finally sworn in as the US ambassador to Luxembourg
after a particularly disgusting fight with conservatives who called
him unfit for diplomatic service. His crime: He was openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   What Neanderthals like Trent Lott objected to was how Hormel had
used his wealth to fund gay causes. What no one objected to is how
Hormel used his wealth to buy himself an ambassadorship. That, of
course, is business as usual in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of rewarding political moneybags with choice
diplomatic posts is as old as the republic. Richard Nixon didn't
put a fine point on it in a conversation with H.R. Haldeman,
recorded in those infamous Nixon Tapes: ``My point is that anybody
who wants to be an ambassador must at least give $250,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, I want to know, is selling nights in the Lincoln bedroom an
outrage and selling ambassadorships OK? And if we can sell
ambassadorships, why can't we see what Cabinet posts will fetch in
the open market? Maybe we could auction them on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Our own James Daley, former owner of the Copley Plaza and the
Back Bay Hilton, is the latest businessman to secure a checkbook
nomination. While it hasn't been announced, Daley tells me he is
``honored to be under consideration'' to become US ambassador to
the Eastern Caribbean _ based in Barbados and also overseeing
relations with Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, Greneda,
St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. This is
good work if you can get it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to pick on Daley. By all accounts he is a nice man
who actually earned his millions. Daley, now 58, literally grew up
living in the Roxbury nursing home his mother ran, thought about
becoming an undertaker, and went on to make his fortune fixing up
broken down nursing homes and later hotels.
</P>
<P>
   As a businessman and hotelier, Daley knows something about
tourism, the number one industry of the Eastern Caribbean. But he
is not in line for that ambassadorship because he knows hotels and
tourism. He is in line for that ambassadorship largely because he
and his wife, Kathleen, have donated at least $271,000 to President
Clinton and the Democrats since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he sees something he likes, price is not an issue,''
Daley's older brother, Michael, once told The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously.
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly interesting about the campaign finance
reports is that Daley is such a newcomer to the game. According to
the Center for Responsive Politics, the Daleys contributed zilch to
the Democrats in the 1994 and 1996 election cycles.
</P>
<P>
   That has changed bigtime in the last three years. When Clinton
came to Boston in January, Daley was one of five local rich guys
the president asked to his hotel suite to discuss fund-raising for
his presidential library. Call them the Boston Five, Clinton's own
Boston bank of deep-pocketed contributors. Daley's $271k doesn't
even include anything yet for the library, but my guess is he'll
manage an appropriate thank you to the president. (Note to the
other members of the Boston Five _ Alan Solomont, Jack Manning,
Howard Kessler and Fred Seigel: You, too, can be an ambassador if
the price is right.)
</P>
<P>
   Of 170 current ambassadors, 61 are so-called political
appointees, the highest percentage in recent history. How can we
talk about campaign finance reform as long as we are selling
ambassadorships to campaign donors? How do we square our commitment
to the new global economy with our old-fashioned practice of
selling ambassadorships to the high bidder?
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. Our government should not be for sale. Not
the presidency, not an ambassadorship. If Daley and his wife want
to go to Barbados, they should _ they've earned it. Travel tip for
the Daleys: Garber Travel can get you into the Almond Beach Club,
an adults-only four-star hotel, for seven nights, all included, for
just $2,419.40 per person. It's not the American Embassy, but then
the rates sure beat what President Clinton is charging you.

&HT;     NEXT UP FOR BUSH, GORE: COURTING THE RENEGADE ELEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY and LANCE WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After five frenetic weeks, the presidential
campaign looks just the way the pundits, the pollsters and the
party establishment scripted it a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the promise of a cliffhanger, the favored candidates,
Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, relied on
their money, connections and political machines to survive
unexpectedly strong assaults from former Sen. Bill Bradley and
Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In a primary that stretched across 16 states, from California to
Maine, Gore won every Democratic contest over Bradley. Bush took
more than 75 percent of the Republican delegates on Tuesday,
virtually eliminating McCain, who carried four states in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's idealistic rhetoric about lifting up the poor and
fostering racial unity fell silent among the wealthiest, most
productive nation in the world. McCain's more effective ``iron
triangle'' message about the abuses of lobbyists, legislation and
money wasn't enough to beat the Republican establishment's chosen
candidate and its well-tuned machine.
</P>
<P>
   Looking toward November, the country will see Gore, the son of a
senator from Tennessee, and Bush, the grandson of a senator from
Connecticut and the son of a president. It's Harvard vs. Yale.
Southern aristocracy vs. the Yankee-with-a-Stetson peerage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unusual story leading to the expected ending,'' said
presidential scholar Jack Pitney of Claremont McKenna College in
California.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a learning experience for the party blue-bloods.
Along the way, McCain ran over Bush's foot with his ``Straight Talk
Express.'' Bradley forced Gore and the centrist New Democrats who
talk about welfare reform and balanced budgets to recognize that
some people had been left behind by America's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began with a moderate, ``compassionate conservative''
mantra, but he sprinted away from it as soon as McCain caught fire
five weeks ago among independent and Democratic voters in New
Hampshire and threatened his Republican base. Bush gave an
ill-fated speech at a South Carolina college accused of bigotry,
shunned the gay and lesbian Log Cabin Republicans, defended
religious conservatives, and proposed a huge tax cut that few
voters embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he began hiking back to the center, and previewed
his challenge against Gore. Bush wants to paint Gore as old news,
stagnant, linked to his boss, President Clinton. Most importantly,
he wants back the more than 2 million people _ independents and
Democrats among them _ who voted for McCain nationwide on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone will make history this November,'' Bush told
supporters in Austin. ``Either we will ratify the status quo, or we
will have a new beginning in American politics. I say: America must
not give Clinton-Gore four more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, faces a tough race against Gore because of the
damage inflicted by McCain's renegade campaign. With Bradley
neutralized, Gore was able to capture more votes than Bush in
California and New York, the two largest states. Bush has started
atoning for his shift to the right in South Carolina, most notably
apologizing to Catholics in New York and speaking at the Museum of
Tolerance in Los Angeles on the eve of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made Bush's campaign stronger in many ways, but it also
exposed weaknesses that Gore will undoubtedly seize upon as they
campaign through November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has got some real work to do to establish himself as a
moderate,'' said Bill Carrick, a veteran consultant for Democrats
in California. ``The South Carolina primary did a lot of damage to
him, and it's not going to be repaired anytime soon. If you look at
who got hit with the most collateral damage, it was Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore must now figure out how to attract those who voted
for McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's appeal was more to the left and I think Gore, being a
centrist Democrat, has a shorter journey to the center than Bush
does,'' said David Lee, executive director of the San
Francisco-based Chinese American Voters Education Committee.
``McCain's attacks on the far right appeal very much to the
moderate and conservative Democrats that Gore needs to capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls in the Super Tuesday states showed that Bush ran
especially well among religious fundamentalists, women and
Republicans of all stripes. McCain appealed in California and
elsewhere to independent voters, registered Democrats and
pro-choice voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's attacks on the Rev. Pat Robertson and other Christian
conservatives _ he called Robertson an ``evil influence'' on the
GOP _ may have backfired, the polls indicated. Voters who
considered the remarks significant overwhelmingly favored Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls showed that Gore thrashed Bradley among every
segment of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's primaries and caucuses took place in 16 states with
nearly 6 million voters, but it hardly seemed devoted to the issues
of education, health care and community that Americans say they
care about.
</P>
<P>
   It became a test of the fortitude and character of the
candidates. Extended debates over the Confederate battle flag, Bob
Jones University in South Carolina and conservative preachers
brought out larger issues about tolerance and how to appeal to
independent voters closed off from the Republican and Democratic
political machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that Gore can take a lickin' and keep on ticking,''
said Henry Brady, a political scientist at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``We learned that George Bush, when pushed,
will go to the right.''
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bush machine stalled a bit in the snows of New Hampshire and
Michigan, where McCain won unexpected victories thanks to Democrats
and independents. Bush's ``Pioneer'' donors, who each helped raise
$100,000, convened strategy meetings and started to worry.
</P>
<P>
   But what didn't kill Bush made him stronger. Derided by McCain
and Bradley, the establishment candidates co-opted the maverick
message, hammered Bradley and McCain as fringe candidates and party
interlopers, focused their message, and spent most of their money.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by Bradley's better-than-expected showing in polls and
fund-raising leading to the New Hampshire primary, Gore packed up
his campaign and moved it to Nashville, expressing astonishment at
himself for even thinking he could run his campaign from
Washington. He started wearing cowboy boots and knit shirts. He
started calling himself, over and over again, a ``fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush started talking about being a ``fresh voice'' and holding
town hall meetings. He offered to shake up the way national
campaigns are financed, McCain's signature issue, as he collected
and spent more money on a presidential campaign than anyone else in
U.S. history _ $65 million so far. He put his compassionate
conservative message away and became a 11reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the exit polls, Bush won huge majorities of voters
looking for a candidate who can win in November or who best
represents conservative values. McCain won among voters who were
looking for someone who is not a typical politician or someone who
stands up for what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters didn't want to give McCain enough to win, but they
wanted to give him enough to scare Bush,'' said Georgia Sorenson, a
senior scholar at the Academy of Leadership at the University of
Maryland. ``They also wanted to send a message that they wanted
more authenticity.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two candidates in America's presidential
contest turned their guns on each other Wednesday, the first shots
in what is likely to be a scorched-earth election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While the votes in the party primaries were still being counted
on Tuesday night, Al Gore for the Democrats and George W. Bush for
the Republicans both presented themselves as the only figures who
could unify the country, while vilifying each other.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore beat Bill Bradley, his opponent for the
Democratic nomination, in every state which was at stake in
Tuesday's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Governor of Texas, emerged the clear victor on the
Republican side against Senator John McCain of Arizona. Though only
half the country has voted in primary contests, it is clear who
will represent each party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fight has just begun,'' said Gore, celebrating his victory
on Tuesday night. ``We need to build on our record of prosperity.
We don't need to go back to where we were before,'' he said, a
reference to the Republican era in the White House which preceded
Bill Clinton's election.
</P>
<P>
   The last Republican president was George Bush, father of the
current candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were challenged and we met the challenge,'' said Bush. ``We
are ready, and I believe our country is ready, to return exiled
honor to the White House,'' a reference to the many ethical
scandals surrounding the administration of Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that both won so strongly suggests a close and
hard-fought campaign. The latest opinion poll, in the Wall Street
Journal on Tuesday, shows them neck and neck in a contest against
each other; other polls show Bush's once substantial lead cut to
single figures. But the general election in November is still
months away.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leaned heavily on the support of the party's right in his
campaigns, especially in South Carolina, a bitter and controversial
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion groups spent $340,000 attacking McCain on Tuesday
alone. While it helped Bush to cement the party hard core, this may
cause problems as he seeks more moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faced a less serious fight against Bill Bradley, and has
less ground to cover as he shifts to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that both candidates are in the political
center, in a time-honored tradition they will now seek to paint
each other as ideologically-crazed zealots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is way to the left. Bush is right in the center of the
Republican Party and right in the political mainstream of the
American people,'' said Haley Barbour, a Bush advisor and prominent
Republican money man.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attacked Bush for ``smear telephone calls from the
extremist right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates desperately need some of the support which went
to John McCain, who pulled in voters from Republican and Democrat
parties as well as independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those Republicans and independents out there whose heroes
are Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, to all of you I say as
well, join with us. Our campaign is now your cause,'' Gore said, a
direct appeal to McCainites.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president immediately took up the cudgels on behalf of
campaign finance reform, McCain's signature issue, calling on the
Republicans to ban ``soft money'' _ cash from interest groups and
companies that can be used to fund national campaigns. The
television ads which make American elections so prohibitively
expensive should also be forsworn, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to ``make this a campaign of ideas and not
insults and conduct it in broad daylight instead of with these
secretly funded special interest attack ads that distort and
dishonor the process of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a clear assault on Bush, whose friends attacked McCain
using privately-funded ads. McCain lashed out at Bush's ``sleazy
Texas buddies,'' and Gore clearly wants voters to remember that.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also moved swiftly to heal differences with Bradley. ``I
have been moved and touched by the strength of his commitment to
healing divisions in this country,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has fought a bitter battle against McCain and will find it
harder to reach out to his opponent. ``I congratulate John,'' he
said on Tuesday night. ``We have our disagreements, but I respect
him and his commitment to reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect, however, has not been the most notable quality of the
Republican battle. &QL;

have been moved and touched by the strength of his commitment to
healing divisions in this country,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has fought a bitter battle against McCain and will find it
harder to reach out to his opponent. ``I congratulate John,'' he
said on Tuesday night. ``We have our disagreements, but I respect
him and his commitment to reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect, however, has not been the most notable quality of the
Republican battle. &QL;

   JERUSALEM _ First corruption allegations, then a stunning defeat
in parliament, and now a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The ground under Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, seems to
be slipping by the day.
</P>
<P>
   The latest blow came Tuesday when a cabinet colleague, Yitzhak
Mordechai _ a former defense minister who now holds the transport
portfolio _ suspended himself from his post pending an
investigation into accusations that he sexually assaulted a
23-year-old woman civil servant.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged incident _ which has caused a storm in the Israel
media, despite the minister's denials _ would normally be chalked
up as a routine political setback, had it not coincided with a
lengthening list of signs that Barak is losing his footing, and
that this is undermining his role in the stalled Middle East peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week his parliamentary coalition fractured, allowing
his opponents to win the first reading of a critical bill.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barak faces a ``no-confidence'' motion after an uproar over
his education minister's plans to include the work of a nationalist
Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, on the school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   If it ever comes to a vote, the signs are that his coalition
would betray him again.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, unrest and tension among the Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza have risen sharply _ with an historic
Papal visit less than two weeks away - fuelled by the endless
failure of their nationalist aspirations to make any progress.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few days, Israel has been living under a state of
heightened alert.
</P>
<P>
   Its security services believe Hamas guerrillas are trying to
step up operations, and claim to have averted a devastating city
center bombing by staging a raid last week in which four suspected
guerrillas were killed.
</P>
<P>
   If true, this is a measure of the current precarious mood; Hamas
leaders tend to approve attacks only when they believe the use of
violence will receive public support from Palestinians _ along with
a willingness to endure the Israeli reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Now the temperature has risen further with a decision by an
Israeli parole board to release a Jewish settler, Yoram Skolnik,
from prison after he served only seven years of a life prison
sentence for killing a Palestinian, who was lying on the ground
with his arms tied, by shooting him in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The move _ taken against the advice of Israel's Attorney
General's office _ has infuriated Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   It has not escaped their notice that one of those who commuted
the settler's original sentence was Israel's president, Ezer
Weizman, who is now under police investigation for accepting huge
cash gifts from a French millionaire friend.
</P>
<P>
   This is not all. Israel's foreign minister, David Levy _ already
under fire for a speech in which promised to avenge future
Hezbollah attacks on Israel with a ``child for a child'' (a threat
that, fulfilled, would amount to a war crime) _ has caused more
havoc by announcing that he would never agree to withdrawal from
the Golan Heights to the border lines of June 4, 1967 _ Syria's
foremost demand, which Barak himself seemed to have accepted.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak's standing has been eroded by an official report that
found massive campaign finance violations by his electoral
coalition, One Israel _ now subject to a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst all this, the country is agonizing over what will happen
when Barak carries out his pledge, confirmed by his cabinet on
Sunday, to withdraw forces from south Lebanon by July, if necessary
without a peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Fears abound that a unilateral withdrawal will make the Middle
East even more unstable, and that an escalating spiral of violence
will begin.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Barak will be around to see it is now becoming a matter
of genuine debate. &QL;

Minnesota. (Shepard, Cox News Service). 20.

   IRS-AUDITS _ WASHINGTON _ Some 20 conservative groups who have
criticized the Clinton adminstration have wound up audited by the
Internal Revenue Service. Are politicians using the tax service to
punish enemies? More than three years since that Watergate-era
question made a comeback, neither Congress, the IRS nor the courts

an almost forgotten probe begun in 1997 will yield a report in the
``next few weeks.'' (Malone, Cox News Service). 20.

security detail ever. It will employ 18,000 police, about $6
million, a papal Black Hawk helicopter and a special mini-Pope
mobile for the narrow streets of Jerusalem's Old City. The project
is overseen by Brig. Gen. David Tsur, an Israeli police official

   ORISSA-RECOVERY _ ERSAMA, India _ Choice is no longer a part of
people's lives in cyclone-ravaged Orissa. India's worst storm of
the century changed the face of the state for years to come and
left the poorest of the country's poor with nothing at all.
According to Atlanta-based CARE, the state's cash crops _ coconut,
betel, papaya _ suffered millions of dollars in damage. Rice
paddies were either swept away by the wind or rotted under water
one month before the December harvest. And 40,000 fishing families
lost their boats and equipment. ``People are still struggling. They
are struggling very much,'' said Orissa's CARE director Basant
Mohanty, who traveled to Atlanta last December to make a personal
appeal for money. (Basu, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   CONFEDERATE-SYMBOLS _ RICHMOND _ Confederate symbols in the home
of the Old Confederacy government are getting even less respect
than the Confederate flag flying atop the South Carolina
Statehouse. The Sons of Confederate Veterans are demanding that
last month's torching of a banner of Gen. Robert E. Lee on a
holiday in his honor be treated by police and prosecutors as a hate
crime against Southerners. Meanwhile, the city council is
considering a proposal to rename two city bridges that honor
Confederate generals J.E.B. Stuart and Stonewall Jackson, replacing
them with the names of two civil rights activists. (Burritt,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   CAMPAIGN-OUTLOOK (Undated) _ What the coming weeks hold for Al
Gore and George W. Bush. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>

</P>

   MCCAIN-COLO (Denver) _ Sen. John McCain is still in the running
in Colorado's primary, which is Friday. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-SUPPORTERS (Washington) _ Bill Bradley's presidential
bid enlisted many who were new to politics, a largely privileged
and idealistic group alienated by the interest group politics of
the Democratic party and the tactical centrism of President
Clinton. In the aftermath of Vice President Gore's bare-knuckled
primary triumph, some of these Bradley supporters express dismay
and disillusion with the state of American campaigns and say they
will do nothing to help Gore defeat Gov. George W. Bush. Their
loyalty, it seems, is to Bradley alone, not to party or process. By
John M. Broder. (1100 words)

Bush. By Don Van Natta and John M. Broder.

</P>
<P>
   MINIMUM-WAGE (Washington) _ A day before House is to take up
bill to increase minimum wage, President Clinton wades into the
congressional battle, saying he favors $1 increase in two years and
would veto a competing plan for a $1 increase over three years.
Current minimum wage is $5.15 an hour. He emphasizes opposition to
tax provisions congress wants to include in its wage bill,
including a reduction in some business taxes and in the inheritance
tax. By Marc Lacey. (800 words)

   KY-POLICE-SHOOTING (Louisville, Ky.) _ A police shooting
incident with eerie echoes of New York City plunges Louisville into
debate about the loyalty of its police force. After the mayor fired
the police chief, his nine field commanders threw down their badges
in protest. There is a standoff with rank and file's police union
which followed the chief decision to give departmental awards to
two cops who shot an unarmed suspect 22 times. By Francis X.
Clines. (1100 words)

   FLA-AUTO-PILEUP (Wellborn, Fla.) _ At least 19 vehicles crashed
on an interstate highway obscured by smoke from a wildfire today,
killing three people and resulting in an acid spill, the Florida

   INDEPENDENT-PHONES (Richmond, Mass.) _ Richmond Telephone, which
serves tiny Richmond, a former mining town in the Berkshires, is a
little different from most phone companies. Its corporate
headquarters is a green-shuttered, white clapboard house on Route
41, just shy of the New York border. It has nine employees,
including a one-man repair crew named Maurice. Its phone book
listings are 12 pages long. And it has been handling the calls for
the 1,168 residents of exchange 698 for the last 96 years. As
archaic as it may seem, more than a thousand small, independent
local exchange companies like Richmond Telephone still do business
in the United States. Many are family-run companies, most dating to
the turn of the last century, that were never part of the Ma Bell
system, never bought out by competitors, and basically were left to
their own devices all these years. By Julie Flaherty.

EVERYONE LOSES AS FEUD CONTINUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many unsuspecting travelers have become pawns in an ongoing feud
between travel agents and one of the world's fastest-growing cruise
lines _ a relationship so soured that most agents seem unmoved by a
$1 million show of respect for their embattled profession.
</P>
<P>
   It's a saga that transcends cruising and sheds insight into the
changing environment in which we plan our travels.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance Cruises, a self-styled renegade, has infuriated
travel agents over the past two years with its heavy emphasis on
direct-to-the-consumer marketing _ a bold strategy in a business
where agents sell about 95 percent of the overall cruise product.
</P>
<P>
   The line's approach _ based largely on direct mailings and sale
pricing on its Internet site _ led to Renaissance's expulsion from
the American Society of Travel Agents. Many agencies refuse to sell
its cruises.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BECOMING A MAJOR PLAYER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, by outward appearances at least, the cruise line _ whose
passenger capacity is more than doubling this year _ wants to kiss
and make up. At the heart of a $1 million advertising campaign in
trade publications, Renaissance vows to become the most travel
agent-friendly line. It touts a 50 percent increase last year in
agency bookings. (``Tomorrow, it will be more,'' ads promise.) And
it claims to now offer ``the fastest, and surest, commission
program of any cruise line.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that thousands of travel agencies have folded over the
past five years because of declining revenues, you'd think this
would serve as encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the immediate reaction included this:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Renaissance's Big Lie,'' headlined Cruise Week newsletter.
``The company's spinmeisters ... don't address the real reasons
agents aren't booking this line.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Deeds, not words, are the order of the day for
Renaissance,'' editorialized Travel Weekly, an industry publication
that reported several subscription cancellations from travel agents
upset that it printed the line's new ads.
</P>
<P>
   I would dismiss this bickering as a private argument except for
its impact on the traveler. During a 12-month period, Renaissance
is introducing four new 680-passenger ships. By 2001, its
ultra-modern fleet will include eight vessels _ with a combined
5,440-passenger capacity _ deployed from Europe to the South
Pacific. The line's itineraries are innovative, its prices
attractive. It's evident that Renaissance is becoming a major
player in the industry, but don't bother asking most travel agents
for a brochure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RETHINKING ITS MARKETING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why such antipathy?
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance's marketing approach is the main issue. While other
travel entities _ especially airlines and tour packagers _ have
made increasingly effective use of the Internet, most cruise lines
continue to rely almost exclusively on travel agents for sales.
Renaissance has represented not just a singular villain _ but the
threat that if it succeeds, others may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance's commission structure also angers travel agents who
say they are rewarded for cruises booked with the line but not for
air arrangements and pre- or post-cruise lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Of more significance to the traveler, one longtime Houston agent
says Renaissance's strict cancellation penalties make it difficult
to obtain recommended third-party insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This last point is a valid concern (although one I suspect
Renaissance would be willing to address if a better rapport were
established). But as for the other areas of disagreement:
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents have repeatedly told us that their main value to
consumers is in providing unbiased service _ that in an era when
individuals are evaluating various alternatives, traditional
agencies are the most viable outlet for true comparison-shopping.
They also have stressed that their main allegiance is to the
traveler, not a specific cruise line or airline or tour packager.
</P>
<P>
   Do these pledges not apply if a customer wants professional
advice in comparing _ without prejudice _ Renaissance with, say,
Carnival or Princess or Radisson Seven Seas (Renaissance's major
competitor in the growing Tahiti cruise market)? Some agents urged
a boycott of United when it initiated the most recent round of
airline commission cuts. Who's next?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Renaissance precipitated this dispute by saying to
travel agents, in effect, ``We don't need you; we can attract
customers ourselves.'' That would sting me, too. But even as it
continues to court direct bookings, a $1 million investment in a
campaign to woo back agents seems a pretty clear indication that
the cruise line _ with so many more berths to fill _ is rethinking
its position. At the least, it's a first step toward
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Renaissance's new strategy lends support to travel
agents' insistence that they can compete effectively with
direct-to-the-consumer booking concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agencies need all the support they can get, too. A recent
study released by the Travel Industry Association of America found
that Internet travel planning rose 1,500 percent between 1996 and
1999, and that online bookings increased 206 percent during that
period.
</P>
<P>
   Will these trends continue? Probably. This much is certain: In
planning our travels, we don't care about commission structures or
grudges. We just want the best available service for the best price
_ and we're willing to shop around until we find it.
</P>
<P>
   I was intrigued by one California travel agent's comments as
quoted in Cruise Week. ``Renaissance,'' he urged, ``must be avoided
by retail travel agents at all costs.'' Why? ``The efforts of any
travel supplier to encourage the consumer to book directly is the
main cancer to the health and vitality of the retail travel
agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The health and vitality of travel agents _ or Renaissance
Cruises or any other aspect of the travel industry _ depends on the
consumer. It's our decision which products to buy. And where to buy
them.

SPRING FLINGS: IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO GO ON A SKI BREAK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Missed winter?
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late to play in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   And play is the operative word. Spring calendars at U.S. ski
resorts are dotted with amusements such as St. Patrick's Day
parades and ``big air'' contests.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is right, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ski resorts may represent the only vacation destinations that
lower prices when the weather becomes more agreeable. So late
season is low season with price breaks on lodging and lift tickets.
</P>
<P>
   First, an advance peek at some fun-filled events:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Wayne Wong World Hot Dog Skiing Festival &AMP; Championships
are scheduled April 14-15 at Alpine Meadows on the California coast
of Lake Tahoe. This psychedelic '70s-inspired event features two
days of outrageous freestyle ski competition, cool shades, lots of
sunshine and plenty of bell bottoms. Event proceeds benefit the
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. For information, call 800-441-4423.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Bust 'n' Burn'' is the name of a mogul competition April 1-2
at Sunday River in Maine. The contest pits the top amateur and pro
bump skiers in the country. Spectators enjoy barbecue, live bands
and watching some brutal skiing. Call 207-824-3000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family fun is the focus of TubaPalooza March 25-26 at
Purgatory Resort near Durango, Colo. Activities are centered on the
resort's snow-tubing hill, where a ``snowcoaster'' whisks tubers to
the  &UR; s &LR; ummit. Call 970-247-9000.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Steamboat Springs in Colorado, the resort celebrates the
close of the ski season with its campy Cardboard Classic on April
1. Now in its 20th year, this contest pits race crafts made
strictly of cardboard, string, water-based paint, duct tape and
masking tape. Call 970-879-6111.
</P>
<P>
   _ You'll need swim attire to participate in Telluride's Surf the
Rockies celebration March 25-April 9. Decked out with pink
flamingos, the Colorado resort offers snow volleyball, concerts,
dance parties and some seriously silly contests. Call 970-728-7485.
</P>
<P>
   _ Snowmass hosts its Spring Jam March 31-April 2. A rite of
spring in Colorado, the event features ski and snowboard
competitions, live music and pro snowboarding demonstrations. Call
800-525-6200.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beaver Creek resort in Colorado hosts the largest snowshoe
race in the country each year with more than 1,200 participants.
The 2000 Snowshoe Shuffle on April 1 will feature 10K and 5K
competitive races and a one-mile fun stroll. Call 800-622-3131.
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the season's most elegant events is Taste of Vail,
which combines spring skiing with superb cuisine and wine. More
than 50 winemakers will participate in the April 6-8 event, which
also spotlights more than 35 of Colorado's best chefs. Participants
enjoy seminars, vintner dinners, mountaintop picnics and apres-ski
tastings. Call 888-311-5665.
</P>
<P>
   Can't make any of these special attractions? Many resorts'
bargain packages cover other late-season dates, and the best
include discounts on both lodging and lift tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Take for instance, Aspen and Snowmass in Colorado. Area lodgings
are offering packages for April that provide seven nights' lodging
and a six-day lift ticket for prices starting at $457 per person,
based on double occupancy. The newly renovated Aspen Club Lodge,
located steps from Aspen Mountain's Silver Queen Gondola, touts
similar packages starting at $639. Call 877-282-7736.
</P>
<P>
   Look for these packages via travel agents, the resorts' 800
numbers, newspaper advertisements and Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The best rates are for midweek stays. Also, when comparing
prices always consider whether extras such as breakfast, lessons
and equipment rentals are included.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other late-season deals. All are subject to
availability. Unless otherwise specified, all prices are per person
based on double occupancy, and air fare is not included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vail, consistently mentioned as one of the country's best ski
resorts, offers a Spring Break special throughout March that
features air fare from Houston and three nights' lodging for prices
starting at $460 per person. The deal is good for four persons
sharing a two-bedroom condominium. Call 800-404-3535.
</P>
<P>
   _ Late-season skiers and snowboarders heading to Heavenly on
Lake Tahoe can take advantage of a ``Snow Dreams'' package that
pairs three nights' lodging, a two-day lift ticket and breakfast
daily for rates starting at $157. The deal is good April 2 through
the end of the season. Call 800-243-2836.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steamboat's ``Spring Snowsaver'' deal is good through March 31
and starts as low as $318 for four nights' lodging and a three-day
lift ticket. Call 800-922-2722.
</P>
<P>
   _ A March Millennium Madness package at Telluride includes five
nights' lodging and a four-day ski pass for fares starting at $630.
Call 800-854-3062.
</P>
<P>
   _ Experience an up-and-comer among ski areas and save some cash
with the Canyons' ``Late Season Value Package.'' For prices
starting at $315, skiers and snowboarders get three nights' lodging
and a two-day lift ticket good at the resort in Park City, Utah.
Call 888-226-9667.
</P>
<P>
   That deal is good March 26 through the end of the season. Plan
your visit right and you can ski for cheap and take in one of those
loopy end-of-season traditions. On April 8, the Canyons hosts its
annual Pond Skimming Contest, where participants try to cross a
100-foot pond on their skis and snowboards. Last season 15 people
made it across the 37-degree water.

&HT;     CALIFORNIA RESULTS POSE CHALLENGE FOR GOP CONTROL OF HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHUCK FINNIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Voters in California gave Democrats reason to
believe they can take back control of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Assemblyman Mike Honda was the top vote-getter
in the swing 15th District in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties,
where most voters are Democrats but have a history of supporting
Republican candidates. Honda captured his party's nomination and
finished ahead of the Republican nominee, Assemblyman Jim Cunneen.
</P>
<P>
   Honda and Cunneen will go head-to-head on Nov. 7 for the seat
being vacated by Republican Tom Campbell, who is running an
underdog campaign for U.S. Senate against incumbent Dianne
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic challenger in the 27th District in Los Angeles
County won more votes than Republican Rep. James Rogan in a beauty
contest in which neither candidate faced competition for their own
party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Darrell Issa, a Republican who lost the 1998 primary
for the U.S. Senate, knocked off state Sen. Bill Morrow for the GOP
nomination for Congress in the 48th District, setting up a
potentially inviting target for Democrats in what historically has
been a Republican stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats need to pick up six seats nationwide to reclaim
control of the House, which they lost to the Republicans in 1994.
So both parties have plenty riding on the 52 California contests to
be decided Nov. 7, particularly in a half-dozen or so races that
are expected to be close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state as a whole has turned Democratic in recent years
with the election of Governor (Gray) Davis and Senator Barbara
Boxer. We have four to six Republican seats that are very
winnable,'' said Jon Del Cecato, spokesman for the national
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. David Dreier, a Republican, said he likes his party's
chances to at least stand its ground in California.
</P>
<P>
   Dreier said he thinks Cunneen will run strong in the 15th
District, a relatively affluent bastion of independent-minded
voters that is represented by Campbell, but formerly by Democrat
Norm Mineta.
</P>
<P>
   ``His basic fiscal conservatism and moderation on social issues
falls right in sync in that district,'' Dreier said of Cunneen.
</P>
<P>
   In a field of nine candidates, however, Honda beat Cunneen 39.6
percent to 33 percent, according to the California secretary of
state's office.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's primary system, the top Republican and
Democratic vote-getters win their party's nomination. Democrat and
Republican voters can cross party lines and cast their ballot for
candidates from the other party.
</P>
<P>
   In another potential trouble spot for Republicans, the 27th
District in Los Angeles County, Rogan was edged by the Democratic
challenger, state Sen. Adam Schiff, 49.1 percent to 47 percent. The
balance of the vote went to Libertarian and Natural Law party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan served as a House prosecutor during the impeachment of
President Clinton, a role that some analysts expect could hurt the
incumbent with independent voters in November in a state where
Clinton is viewed favorably.
</P>
<P>
   In the military-minded 48th District in northern San Diego
County, Issa, a car-alarm magnate, led Morrow and Mark Dornan, son
of former Rep. Robert Dornan. Issa, Morrow and Dornan are vying to
succeed nine-term Republican Rep. Ron Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Issa had 35 percent to Morrow's 23 percent. Issa would face
Peter Kouvelis, a Marine from Dana Point who was the top Democratic
vote-getter with 11 percent among all voters.
</P>
<P>
   The contest could represent an unexpected opportunity for
Kouvelis and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 Republican Senate primary, Issa confronted questions
about the veracity of autobiographical claims about his Army
career, which were exploited by his opponent, then-state Treasurer
Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Kouvelis could take a page out of Fong's playbook in a district
that hosts Camp Pendleton Marine base.
</P>
<P>
   Another key battleground figures to be the 36th District in Los
Angeles County, where former Rep. Jane Harman hopes to reclaim a
seat from incumbent Rep. Steven Kuykendall. Harman vacated the job
in 1998 for a failed bid for the Democratic nomination for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Kuykendall outdrew Harman 42.2 percent to 40.7
percent, according to the secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, where the GOP hopes to compete for the
Democratic seat held by second-term Rep. Loretta Sanchez, the
results Tuesday won't encourage them.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez had 58 percent and two Republicans on the ballot had 38
percent combined.

SATIRE SO TAME IT TAKES THE FUN OUT OF `GOD, THE DEVIL AND BOB' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone's a critic. At least two NBC affiliates, one in Salt
Lake City, the other in Pocatello, Idaho, say they will refuse to
air ``God, the Devil and Bob'' when it premieres Thursday night.
Each station is in a community where the Mormon Church dominates
the spiritual side of life (and a lot more), and where irreverence
goes down harder than an aspirin without water.
</P>
<P>
   They'd probably get less notice if they just said the show isn't
airing because it isn't funny. But stations that pre-sanitize for
their viewers' protection probably don't have the greatest senses
of humor and most likely wouldn't know funny from fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't have stations worrying about bruising their
feelings, ``God, the Devil and Bob'' may be remembered as the
dullest example of irreverence since Sister Maurice jabbed me in
the nose during my altar-boy days and I bled like an ``ER'' goner
all over my white surplice.
</P>
<P>
   Sister's initial reaction to the playful jab was priceless. But
when I explained that I could get a nosebleed just by thinking
about it, she seemed strangely disappointed, almost let down that
the moment wasn't as funny/dramatic as it started out.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to get the same feeling from ``God, the Devil and
Bob,'' especially after knowing that James Garner is doing the
voice of God in this animated series. There could be no better
voice to give life to an all-knowing, all-seeing, all-laconic deity
than the guy who was both Bret Maverick and Jim Rockford. The fact
that God looks like Jerry Garcia is also a cute fillip, but Garner
doesn't get the necessary support from writers who are obviously
holding back for network TV. Thus, what we get is satire so tame it
wouldn't bite even if it had teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this midseason entry, which launches after
``Friends'' Thursday but moves to Tuesdays at 8:30 next week, is
that God is thinking of ``chucking the whole thing and starting
over,'' to use the big guy's own words.
</P>
<P>
   The devil, delighted at this news, tries to goad God into
pulling the plug right now, but God decides to give humankind one
more chance. He says if one person can prove to him that the world
is worth saving, he'll back off. To be fair, God lets the devil
choose the unwitting schmo who must save the world: a
beer-drinking, porn-watching guy named Bob Alman (voiced by French
Stewart).
</P>
<P>
   God admits Bob isn't a showroom-floor sample of his best work,
but he relents: ``OK, a deal's a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The devil replies: ``And if he fails, you'll destroy the whole
thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tease me,'' the devil warns, ``like with the
flood.''
</P>
<P>
   God replies: ``When are you going to let that go?''
</P>
<P>
   This is about as irreverent as ``God, the Devil and Bob'' gets,
unless you count the part where Bob is in bed explaining this
impossible mission to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna, this is serious,'' he says. ``God has literally put the
fate of mankind in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And these would be the same hands that are inching up my
nightie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a little confidence builder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good night, Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, when in doubt, go with the sex joke. Just like
every other lame sitcom of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The show, created by a former seminary student who had a hand in
two truly forgettable series ``Men Behaving Badly'' and
``Townies,'' kept me thinking of ``The Simpsons,'' as in, ``This
would be so much better if `The Simpsons' people were doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson,
lends her voice to Bob's rebellious daughter, Megan, but the
``Simpsons'' magic hasn't rubbed off, despite a mother lode of
irreverent possibilities. On cable, in fact, ``God, the Devil and
Bob'' would probably be funny as hell. On NBC, it's more like
purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   God, the Devil and Bob. Half-hour animated comedy about an
average guy chosen to redeem mankind. Voices by James Garner,
French Stewart, Alan Cumming, Laurie Metcalf, Nancy Cartwright and
Kath Soucie. Series premieres Thursday night on NBC, moves to
Tuesdays next week. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-

   (UNDATED) _ ``For goodness sake don't quote me,'' a very senior
Clinton administration official said recently. ``Frankly though,
even if George W. wins the White House, judging by the people
around him, I think the foreign policy he conducts won't be very
different from what you see right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such of course will not be the impression conveyed as the U.S.
presidential election campaign moves towards its climax later this
year, and accusations of incompetence, bias and pusillanimity fill
the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   But this week's de facto coronation of Vice President Al Gore
and George W. Bush as the Democrat and Republican standard-bearers
in November sets up a choice which, for America's allies, could
hardly be more reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have been mocked for his mangling of the English
language and his inability to name various world leaders in the
news. It is also true that his direct foreign policy experience is
next to nil. But his pedigree is impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, Sr. too was famous for the malapropisms known as
Bushisms. But by common consent he was one of the most skilled
foreign policy presidents of recent times, and several of his close
aides are helping behind the scenes with his son's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are wise old retainers like Brent Scowcroft, National
Security Advisor between 1989 and 1993, and Condolezza Rice, a key
policymaker on the Soviet Union for George Sr. She is respected by
Democrats as well as Republicans, and tipped as a possible NSA
chief for Bush Jr.
</P>
<P>
   And when thoughts turn to potential Republican secretaries of
state, the name that trips first off almost tongue is that of Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs under Bush, the presidential
dream candidate-who-never-was in 1996, and everybody's favorite
American statesman.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, his credentials could hardly be better. No vice
president has been more closely involved in foreign policy-making,
with special responsibilities in key areas like Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On many issues, notably the Balkans, his instincts are more
hawkish than those of the current president. For the first time,
too, since Teddy Roosevelt 90 years ago, the U.S. would have a
president interested in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens in November, we're not very worried either
way,'' one British diplomat says, summing up the prevailing mood.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the one discernible frisson is over the man widely
tipped to be Gore's secretary of state, the redoubtable Richard
Holbrooke, current U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and
architect of the Dayton peace accords in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions Holbrooke's talents _ only the mixture of
self-promotion and diplomatic thuggery with which he projects
them. &QL;

<P>
   Q: Where can I purchase a ``Trailer Trash Barbie-type fashion

</P>
<P>
   A: The mail-order retailer Poor White Trash is selling a

   The doll, the subject of several media reports, is a
Barbie-style doll complete with a cigarette, blackened tooth, hair
curlers, beer can and ``dirty-faced baby on hip.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also sells a Ken-style doll that wears women's
clothing; a street-walking Barbie-style doll; and ``Dukes of
Hazzard'' memorabilia.

   Q: Sycamore School Road in Fort Worth does not have a school on
it today. What was it named after? _ J.T., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The road takes its name from a one- or two-room school that
was at the corner of Sycamore School and Crowley roads for 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   Billy W. Sills, a volunteer archivist for the Fort Worth school
district, found records dating to 1884. ``That area was known as
the Sycamore School District No. 64,'' Sills said. ``It was
probably named for Sycamore Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   The school apparently closed in 1940, Sills said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On last week's episode of ``Once and Again,'' a book of
poetry was discussed, and I think the name was ``North River Wind''
or something like that. Is it a real book? _ P.F., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A:According to fans of the show on the rec.arts.tv Internet
discussion group, the poem featured on the show was ``George
Gray,'' from the book ``Spoon River Anthology'' by Edgar Lee
Masters.

   (UNDATED) _ ``For goodness sake don't quote me,'' a very senior
Clinton administration official said recently. ``Frankly though,
even if George W. wins the White House, judging by the people
around him, I think the foreign policy he conducts won't be very
different from what you see right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such of course will not be the impression conveyed as the U.S.
presidential election campaign moves towards its climax later this
year, and accusations of incompetence, bias and pusillanimity fill
the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   But this week's de facto coronation of Vice President Al Gore
and George W. Bush as the Democrat and Republican standard-bearers
in November sets up a choice which, for America's allies, could
hardly be more reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have been mocked for his mangling of the English
language and his inability to name various world leaders in the
news. It is also true that his direct foreign policy experience is
next to nil. But his pedigree is impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, Sr. too was famous for the malapropisms known as
Bushisms. But by common consent he was one of the most skilled
foreign policy presidents of recent times, and several of his close
aides are helping behind the scenes with his son's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are wise old retainers like Brent Scowcroft, National
Security Advisor between 1989 and 1993, and Condolezza Rice, a key
policymaker on the Soviet Union for George Sr. She is respected by
Democrats as well as Republicans, and tipped as a possible NSA
chief for Bush Jr.
</P>
<P>
   And when thoughts turn to potential Republican secretaries of
state, the name that trips first off almost tongue is that of Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs under Bush, the presidential
dream candidate-who-never-was in 1996, and everybody's favorite
American statesman.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, his credentials could hardly be better. No vice
president has been more closely involved in foreign policy-making,
with special responsibilities in key areas like Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On many issues, notably the Balkans, his instincts are more
hawkish than those of the current president. For the first time,
too, since Teddy Roosevelt 90 years ago, the U.S. would have a
president interested in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens in November, we're not very worried either
way,'' one British diplomat says, summing up the prevailing mood.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the one discernible frisson is over the man widely
tipped to be Gore's secretary of state, the redoubtable Richard
Holbrooke, current U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and
architect of the Dayton peace accords in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions Holbrooke's talents _ only the mixture of
self-promotion and diplomatic thuggery with which he projects
them. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two rebel candidates for the U.S. presidency
were set to bow to the inevitable and leave the race after
suffering crushing defeats in Tuesday's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Closeted with their families and advisers at opposite ends of
the country for much of Wednesday, they were expected to make
formal announcements Thursday that their insurgencies, which had
generated so much excitement and inspired record turnouts from New
England to California, were at an end.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, who won not a
single state, let it be known that he would throw in his lot with
Vice President Al Gore when he announced his formal withdrawal
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona, whose duel with George W. Bush
had become particularly bitter and personal in its latter stages,
was still considering his position, despite this chummy invitation
from Bush in a breakfast television interview Wednesday: ``I would
say, John, let's team up and let's win. Let's beat Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not, as Bush then clarified, an offer of the vice
presidential slot to McCain, just a call to unity.
</P>
<P>
   His team had hoped that McCain would be able to come close
enough to Bush in a sufficient number of states to justify
continuing his challenge, but all the big prizes _ California, New
York and Ohio _ eluded him on Tuesday, leaving him with victories
only in four of the five small New England states and decisively
defeated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The effective end to the insurgencies that had breathed new life
into a flagging primary process and galvanized hundreds of
thousands of new voters was mourned by supporters of both men.
</P>
<P>
   Radio talk shows and the Internet buzzed with the protests of
disconsolate voters, pledging to vote for no one in November rather
than betray their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   America's vast army of media pundits, however, was downbeat,
dismissing the end of the rebellions as only to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   No insurgent, they pointed out, has won the Republican
presidential nomination since 1964, and Barry Goldwater's win then
was possible only because the party establishment was in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, it was noted, even so popular and well
supported a figure as Edward Kennedy was unable to buck the system.
</P>
<P>
   The organizational advantage enjoyed by Gore as vice president
and Bush as the early anointee of his party hierarchy was
formidable. The youth and enthusiasm of the insurgents' campaign
staff could not compensate for the presence on the ground of Bush
and Gore campaign workers in practically every constituency for
weeks and even months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and McCain had sharp professionals masterminding
their campaign strategies; when the pace of primaries accelerated
and campaigns had to be waged simultaneously in far distant parts
of the country, however, there was nothing to having the support of
the local trade union or Republican machine.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had made a failed bid for the union machine; but both he
and McCain were treated as pariahs by their respective parties.
</P>
<P>
   They could count the number of Congressional and state
government supporters only in low single digits, and while this
proved a perverse advantage to McCain in Michigan, where he
benefited from a protest vote against the state governor, the
opposite was more often true.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the times, perhaps, money was less of an advantage
to the front-runners than establishment clout. Bush's record 70
million dollar war chest was down to its last 10 million before
Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley tapped into new sources of money via the
Internet. Bradley also attracted wealthy sponsors from Wall Street
and Silicon Valley, and if money were the only consideration they
could both plausibly continue their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns, however, made mistakes, and Bradley's in
particular suffered an eerie sequence of sheer bad luck. Bradley's
first and biggest mistake, with hindsight, was not to rebuff and
keep rebuffing the malevolent misrepresentation of his health
proposals that was put about by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Once pensioners, the poor and ethnic minorities were given the
idea that Bradley's plans would make them worse off, Bradley lost
some of his key constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain learned from Bradley's early mistake, and responded to
each and every underhand attack from the Bush campaign. There were
drawbacks to that tactic, too, however, as McCain risked being seen
as excessively combative.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the ethical high road, as both insurgents tried to do,
was the key to much of their initial support. But it left them
damned if they retaliated in kind to their opponents' so-called
``negative advertising,'' and damned if they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bradley was starting to get his campaign back on track,
he was forced to cancel two days of a West Coast tour because of a
heart problem.
</P>
<P>
   However he might insist that an irregular heartbeat was no
impediment to being president, it dented his image as a super-fit
former athlete and his failure to disclose it before damaged his
reputation for straight talk.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, his luck just seemed to run out: the heating on a
chartered plane failed, another developed engine trouble; and at
his final rally the lights fused.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest piece of bad luck, however, was John McCain. In the
early primaries, the two were essentially competing for many of the
same voters: independent-minded and nonaffiliated voters with an
interest in changing the political system.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's heroic life history and his talent for ``connecting''
with voters gave him an immediate advantage over Bradley. Bradley
lost New Hampshire to Gore by only 4 percent; McCain beat Bush by
19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If even a few of those votes had gone to Bradley, the whole
course of the race might have been different.
</P>
<P>
   In winning over Bradley's voters, however, McCain arguably lost
his own. His appeal to independents and Democrats came at the
expense of his appeal to mainstream Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Among McCain's devoted supporters, many are already pressing him
to leave the Republican Party and run for the presidency as an
independent. Even as he conceded defeat on Tuesday night, however,
McCain repeated his insistence that he was a loyal Republican and
would stick with his party. That is unlikely to change overnight. &QL;

&HT;     VOTERS REJECT OVERHAUL OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIN McCORMICK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Overhauling the way national campaigns are
financed may be an issue in the presidential race. But California
voters emphatically rejected Proposition 25, a complicated measure
that would have devoted up to $55 million in state money to
providing public financing for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would have rewritten the rule book on how money
could be raised and spent in California elections, including
limiting how much money contributors could give to candidates.
There are virtually no restrictions now.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Proposition 25 wound up pitting two
millionaires, who contributed nearly $2 million to become the main
supporters of the proposition, against the fund-raising clout of
both the Democratic and Republican parties, which fought it.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, including Gov. Gray Davis, charged that the long,
complicated measure made the ``cure was worse than the disease.''
As of last week, they had raised $2.4 million to fight it. The
ballot initiative won only 35 percent of the vote in Tuesday's
election.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the measure charged that opponents were political
insiders trying to protect the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is one case where the disease beat the cure _
with big money,'' said former Secretary of State Tony Miller, a
co-author of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition's other co-author was Silicon Valley executive
Ron Unz, who pumped nearly $1 million into the campaign. Unz led a
successful ballot initiative drive last year to dismantle bilingual
education in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Days before the election, Beverly Hills investor Max Palevsky
contributed $1 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents criticized the measure for not limiting the amount of
money rich candidates could spend on their own campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has prohibited such restrictions, ruling
that stopping people from spending money on their own campaigns
would be a violation of their free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet opponents argued that, by restricting fund-raising without
limiting the resources of millionaires, the measure would give rich
people the upper hand in elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was put on the ballot by someone who's a millionaire and a
political candidate _ Ron Unz,'' said Nick DeLuca, communications
director for the campaign against Proposition 25. ``And it's
written to benefit millionaire political candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposition sought to put a $5,000-per-election limit on
donations to statewide candidates from most sources. It would have
barred corporate contributions and imposed fund-raising blackout
periods of up to a year before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who agreed to abide by spending limits would have
been eligible to receive state-funded broadcast advertising on a
first-come, first-served basis. A candidate for governor could
receive up to $1 million in ads, while other statewide candidates
could get up to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The multifaceted proposition might have been killed by its own
complexity, said pollster David Binder, who conducted focus group
interviews for the opponents of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   He said some people didn't like the fact that state money would
be used for campaigns. Others weren't happy with the campaign
contribution limits, while others objected to Unz's sponsorship of
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had things for a lot of people to dislike,'' he said.
``When measures become so complex, a lot of people just vote
`no.'''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two rebel candidates for the U.S. presidency
were set to bow to the inevitable and leave the race after
suffering crushing defeats in Tuesday's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Closeted with their families and advisers at opposite ends of
the country for much of Wednesday, they were expected to make
formal announcements Thursday that their insurgencies, which had
generated so much excitement and inspired record turnouts from New
England to California, were at an end.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, who won not a
single state, let it be known that he would throw in his lot with
Vice President Al Gore when he announced his formal withdrawal
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona, whose duel with George W. Bush
had become particularly bitter and personal in its latter stages,
was still considering his position, despite this chummy invitation
from Bush in a breakfast television interview Wednesday: ``I would
say, John, let's team up and let's win. Let's beat Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not, as Bush then clarified, an offer of the vice
presidential slot to McCain, just a call to unity.
</P>
<P>
   His team had hoped that McCain would be able to come close
enough to Bush in a sufficient number of states to justify
continuing his challenge, but all the big prizes _ California, New
York and Ohio _ eluded him on Tuesday, leaving him with victories
only in four of the five small New England states and decisively
defeated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The effective end to the insurgencies that had breathed new life
into a flagging primary process and galvanized hundreds of
thousands of new voters was mourned by supporters of both men.
</P>
<P>
   Radio talk shows and the Internet buzzed with the protests of
disconsolate voters, pledging to vote for no one in November rather
than betray their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   America's vast army of media pundits, however, was downbeat,
dismissing the end of the rebellions as only to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   No insurgent, they pointed out, has won the Republican
presidential nomination since 1964, and Barry Goldwater's win then
was possible only because the party establishment was in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, it was noted, even so popular and well
supported a figure as Edward Kennedy was unable to buck the system.
</P>
<P>
   The organizational advantage enjoyed by Gore as vice president
and Bush as the early anointee of his party hierarchy was
formidable. The youth and enthusiasm of the insurgents' campaign
staff could not compensate for the presence on the ground of Bush
and Gore campaign workers in practically every constituency for
weeks and even months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and McCain had sharp professionals masterminding
their campaign strategies; when the pace of primaries accelerated
and campaigns had to be waged simultaneously in far distant parts
of the country, however, there was nothing to having the support of
the local trade union or Republican machine.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had made a failed bid for the union machine; but both he
and McCain were treated as pariahs by their respective parties.
</P>
<P>
   They could count the number of Congressional and state
government supporters only in low single digits, and while this
proved a perverse advantage to McCain in Michigan, where he
benefited from a protest vote against the state governor, the
opposite was more often true.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the times, perhaps, money was less of an advantage
to the front-runners than establishment clout. Bush's record 70
million dollar war chest was down to its last 10 million before
Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley tapped into new sources of money via the
Internet. Bradley also attracted wealthy sponsors from Wall Street
and Silicon Valley, and if money were the only consideration they
could both plausibly continue their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns, however, made mistakes, and Bradley's in
particular suffered an eerie sequence of sheer bad luck. Bradley's
first and biggest mistake, with hindsight, was not to rebuff and
keep rebuffing the malevolent misrepresentation of his health
proposals that was put about by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Once pensioners, the poor and ethnic minorities were given the
idea that Bradley's plans would make them worse off, Bradley lost
some of his key constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain learned from Bradley's early mistake, and responded to
each and every underhand attack from the Bush campaign. There were
drawbacks to that tactic, too, however, as McCain risked being seen
as excessively combative.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the ethical high road, as both insurgents tried to do,
was the key to much of their initial support. But it left them
damned if they retaliated in kind to their opponents' so-called
``negative advertising,'' and damned if they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bradley was starting to get his campaign back on track,
he was forced to cancel two days of a West Coast tour because of a
heart problem.
</P>
<P>
   However he might insist that an irregular heartbeat was no
impediment to being president, it dented his image as a super-fit
former athlete and his failure to disclose it before damaged his
reputation for straight talk.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, his luck just seemed to run out: the heating on a
chartered plane failed, another developed engine trouble; and at
his final rally the lights fused.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest piece of bad luck, however, was John McCain. In the
early primaries, the two were essentially competing for many of the
same voters: independent-minded and nonaffiliated voters with an
interest in changing the political system.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's heroic life history and his talent for ``connecting''
with voters gave him an immediate advantage over Bradley. Bradley
lost New Hampshire to Gore by only 4 percent; McCain beat Bush by
19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If even a few of those votes had gone to Bradley, the whole
course of the race might have been different.
</P>
<P>
   In winning over Bradley's voters, however, McCain arguably lost
his own. His appeal to independents and Democrats came at the
expense of his appeal to mainstream Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Among McCain's devoted supporters, many are already pressing him
to leave the Republican Party and run for the presidency as an
independent. Even as he conceded defeat on Tuesday night, however,
McCain repeated his insistence that he was a loyal Republican and
would stick with his party. That is unlikely to change overnight. &QL;

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We are going to install two telescoping jack posts in our
basement to raise the sagging floor in our kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   There is a concrete floor in the basement, but we have been told
that each post needs a deeper concrete footing to act as a solid
foundation under the base of the post.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think we can rest the posts on the existing concrete
floor, or do we need to somehow add to the existing concrete?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most concrete basement floors are only four inches thick, and
this is really not thick enough to properly support an adjustable
jack post.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the concrete is at least six inches thick you should put
down an extra foundation by chopping a hole in the floor and
digging down until the hole is 12 inches deep (below the surface of
the existing concrete slab).
</P>
<P>
   Then fill this hole with concrete up to the level of the
existing floor and allow this to cure for several days before
setting the jack posts on top.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a brass lamp that is over 50 years old. It has become
dull and dirty looking _ no matter how I try to clean it.
</P>
<P>
   I am not really certain it is solid brass, but I did try a brass
polish and that didn't seem to help much.
</P>
<P>
   Can you suggest any method for cleaning or polishing this brass
lamp?
</P>
<P>
   A: If it is not solid brass, no brass polish will help.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to determine if it is brass is to scratch on the
bottom or in an inconspicuous corner or side with an ice pick or
pointed knife.
</P>
<P>
   If a metallic or gray color shows through you will know it is
not solid brass _ it is probably just brass plated. Solid brass
will be the same color throughout.
</P>
<P>
   If it is solid brass, on the other hand, it may have had a clear
lacquer coating on it and this would explain why the brass polish
didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The lacquer must be stripped off first (using acetone or lacquer
thinner), after which you can use the polish.
</P>
<P>
   After cleaning and polishing apply a fresh coat of clear
lacquer, otherwise it will tarnish quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The cedar shingles on the outside of my house have split in
several places, so I would like to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   I have had no trouble removing the nails along the bottom of
each shingle, but I still can't pull the shingles out because there
are nails along the top of each shingle that also go through the
bottom of the shingle above it.
</P>
<P>
   How do I get these upper nails out without damaging the shingle
above, and without ripping off a whole row of shingles above the
damaged one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Use a hacksaw blade without a handle. Slide the end of the
blade up under the good shingle that is directly above the one that
you want to remove, then work it up and down to cut off the nails
from below.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid cutting your hand with the hacksaw blade you can wrap
the end of the blade with several layers of duct tape, or you can
use one of the special hacksaw blade holders that enable you to lay
the blade almost flat against the surface while working.
</P>
<P>
   After these nails are cut off you will be able to slide out the
damaged shingle, then tap a new shingle up in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My water pipes make pounding or hammering noise when we turn
on the cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the noise occurs immediately after the water has been
turned off or on and sometimes only while it is being turned on.
</P>
<P>
   What can be causing this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most likely cause is a condition known as ``water
hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   This is due to water being brought to a sudden stop, building up
pressure and then causing it to slam against the walls of the pipe
as it goes around elbows and against other fittings when you turn
the water on or off.
</P>
<P>
   It can usually be corrected by installing anti-hammer devices in
several places throughout the system.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible cause could be loose pipe mounting straps that
allow the pipes to move or rattle when water rushes through them.
</P>
<P>

Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general

</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``JACK POST'' goes with this column.
</P>

base that is at least 12 inches thick.

 &HT;    POPE'S VISIT, 'OPERATION: OLD FRIEND,' ISRAEL'S BIGGEST SECURITY
CASE
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Calling it ``Operation: Old Friend,'' Israeli
officials are planning the biggest security detail in the country's
history for the visit of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most complicated, largest and most sophisticated
security operation of VIP protection that we've ever had,'' Israeli
Police Brigadier General David Tsur told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tsur, 40, is an anti-terrorism specialist who spent a year
consulting with the Georgia Department of Public Safety for the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta. He oversaw Israeli security on the turn
of the millennium and is lead coordinator for the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   He said the visit is a much tougher case than visits of U.S.
President Bill Clinton. Clinton, Tsur said, moves quickly and
usually just attends closed meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, on the other hand, will hold public masses and travel
at low speeds so he can be viewed in his so-called ``Pope mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit is also tougher for its duration. The pope is
scheduled to visit Israel and the Palestinian Authority for six
days. It is the first visit by a pope to the region since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay, the 79-year-old pontiff is expected to fly to
events in an Israeli Black Hawk helicopter. He is to move in the
narrow stone streets of Jerusalem's Old City in a specially made
mini-Pope mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are currently constructing ramps to smooth out the
stepped paths of the Old City. They are also rushing to finish
seating and staging for an outdoor mass the pope will conduct near
the Sea of Galilee. About 100,000 people are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Tsur said 18,000 police will work during the visit, out of the
national force that has just 26,000 people, including
administrative staff. About 4,000 Israeli soldiers will join them.
</P>
<P>
   He said the visit will cost Israel nearly $10 million, not
including salaries for those involved.
</P>
<P>
   Tsur came to Marietta, Ga., in 1995 with his wife and three
children to consult in the Olympics security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics were bigger, larger, more complicated,'' he said,
``But the pope is a target.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Tsur said that police had no knowledge of any specific
threats against the pope.

traveling 40,000 miles, arriving home to his parents' apartment in
New York City on Christmas Eve, 18 months later. He filmed the trip
on a 35-millimeter camera that looked more like a sextant. He had
six flat tires. He ran out of gas only once, just outside of
Munich. ``The Long Journey Home,'' a selection of stills from the
4,000 feet of film Fulton shot, is being published next month by
August Press. His first exhibition of stills, photographs and
sculpture opens at Exhibit A in Manhattan on April 6. By William L.

New York subway rider, who, let's face it, wants out. Even today,
when a vast capital improvement program has made the subway system
significantly cleaner, safer, more efficient, more comfortable and
even more attractive than it has been in decades, life underground
resists cheeriness. So when a bright, playful design element
blossoms in our municipal netherworld, it deserves notice, even
gratitude. By Peter Edidin.

`GOD, THE DEVIL AND BOB' COMMITS CARDINAL SIN OF COMEDY: IT'S NOT
FUNNY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was prime-time animation, and it was
good. But with networks rushing to cash in on the kind of lucrative
'toon trade that helped propel and cement Fox's ``real network''
status (thanks partly to shows such as ``The Simpsons, King of the
Hill, Futurama'' and ``The Family Guy'') the quest for high-quality
material hasn't necessarily kept pace.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if anybody with a home-computer animation program
and an idea that network suits think is edgy and provocative could
score their own series these days. If you still have doubts, check
out the series premiere of NBC's entry into the cartoon cacophony,
``God, the Devil and Bob'' at 7:30 p.m. Thursday. Tackling the
topic of religion (See? Controversial already; in fact, two NBC
affiliates have said they won't air the show.) the show's
pretentious premise would have us believe that God (glumly voiced
by James Garner _ wouldn't George Carlin have been really cool in
this part?) is a sunglasses-wearing hipster who decides one day _
while kicking back with the Devil, no less (given voice by Alan
Cumming, who really should have known better) _ that Earth and all
its problems have grown tiresome. Perhaps, God thinks, it's time to
end his own version of reality programming.
</P>
<P>
   God decides to hang the fate of the world on the shoulders of
one man. To make it sporting, he lets the Devil do the choosing.
Enter Bob (French Stewart, who's getting more annoying every day),
a lazy, inattentive, working-class schlub _ in other words, the
same moron-with-a-heart-of-gold stock character that passes as the
father figure on almost every family cartoon series on TV. (Look up
``Simpson, Homer'' or ``Hill, Hank'' for the best-known
examples.'')
</P>
<P>
   As anyone knows who has been trusted with, say, the
responsibility of sitting next to an emergency-airplane exit,
putting lives in your hands is not a pleasant burden. The premise
seems as though it could generate some comic heat. No such luck. In
fact, things go predictably: God reveals his purpose to Bob, who's
none too pleased with his responsibilities. Neither are Bob's wife
(Laurie Metcalf) or his two children, but he is determined to save
the world in spite of any trickery on the Devil's part. Hilarity
does not ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because the humor is so forced that you can
almost hear the marketing team telling the writers, ``This sort of
stuff always works on `The Simpsons.' '' Sure, there are lots of
biblical puns and contemporary pop-culture references, but
everything is so safe and bland that it wouldn't offend Steve
Allen. The occasional off-the-cuff church-related remarks on ``The
Simpsons'' are based on compassion for religious principles but
hatred for religious hypocrisy. It's that honesty that makes the
remarks funny. Example: In one episode, Bart Simpson tells his
friend Milhouse that the ``soul'' is something grown-ups invented
just to scare kids, ``like the bogeyman, or Michael Jackson.''
Milhouse then asks Bart what the church would have to gain by such
sleight-of-hand. Cut to the Rev. Lovejoy pouring money from the
offering plates into a coin separator. That scene is more
insightful than three episodes of this ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   The animation fares no better. It's barely a notch above the
``squigglevision'' technique on Comedy Central's ``Dr. Katz,''
which at least has characters that are engaging and likable. And
Cumming's Devil is reduced to a mere annoyance _ not that any
animated Satan will ever come close to matching the dark-comic
hilarity of the ``South Park'' rendition of the Prince of Darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, the Devil and Bob'''s most unforgivable trespass is that
it just isn't funny. Future episodes are a little better
(especially when Satan begins dating Bob's daughter while disguised
as the perfect boy) but they unfortunately don't rise above
chuckle-worthy. With luck, perhaps even prayer, NBC will soon smite
this one from its schedule.

GREAT, NOT PERFECT: MARTIN LUTHER KING AN ANCESTOR OF RAP, AUTHOR
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Eric Dyson thinks Martin Luther King Jr. is the greatest
American ever, greater than Washington or Jefferson or any other
contender.
</P>
<P>
   But part of his respect for the late civil rights leader is a
belief ``that (King) proves God uses deeply flawed human beings to
do great things.'' So in ``I May Not Get There With You: The True
Martin Luther King Jr.'' (Free Press, $25), Dyson, a professor at
DePaul University and author of several books about
African-American leaders and culture, reflects candidly on what he
says is King's occasional penchant for plagiarism, extramarital
affairs and militantism even as he praises him for eloquence,
leadership and courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to know why there had to be yet another
biography of Martin Luther King, well, he's wrongly been made out
over the years as a simple icon,'' Dyson said on a recent visit to
the Star-Telegram. ``And when he has been simplified, his legend
and words have been twisted in support of people and causes he
would never, ever have embraced. Now when he is remembered, people
forget how he was a radical threat to the status quo. He would not
only have approved of, he would have stood alongside, Jesse Jackson
and Al Sharpton today. His sanitation, as I call it, reduces him,
and I don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson, 41, an ordained Baptist minister, said his fascination
with King began in 1968, when he was 9. ``He was assassinated that
year, and I really didn't know who he was,'' Dyson said. ``As, over
the years, I learned more about him, I kept wanting to know more.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson eventually began to write books _ ``Making Malcolm: The
Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X'' (Oxford University Press, $10.95);
``Race Rules: Navigating the Color Line'' (Vintage Books, $12);
``Between God and Gangsta Rap'' (Oxford University Press, $27.50) _
which earned him recognition as an eloquent spokesman for black
Americans. But ``I May Not Get There With You,'' he said, isn't
doing as much for his reputation, at least among African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this book tour I'm doing lots of call-in (radio) shows,''
Dyson said. ``Those calls offer me a lot of resistance, especially
from black people. I knew, in being candid about this man, who is a
sort of sacrosanct ideal, I would encounter resistance, but I
didn't anticipate the virulence. I'm being accused of trying to
hurt his legacy, when all I want is for people to truly understand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dyson's view, Martin Luther King Jr. was a militant, a
committed economic socialist whose focus in his last days had
expanded from civil rights to deepening concern about economic
injustice and the Vietnam War as an outgrowth of mainstream
America's desire to keep lower-income citizens of all races out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dyson said, King is a direct ancestor of rap music and
hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting Tupac Shakur or Snoop Doggy Dogg are the
moral equivalent of King, but, like him, they are trying to address
great things,'' Dyson said. ``They are very young; Martin Luther
King burst on the national scene as a very young man. He was 39
when he died, remember. That is not great old age. So when I see
the modern voices being denigrated for personal mistakes these
young people make, I would like them to think of King and know they
can surmount obstacles that hinder their success.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Dyson contends, ``in a way, his death at 39 saved him.
His popularity was down, way down, especially in the black
community. Other leaders _ Stokely Carmichael, (H. Rap) Brown, were
calling him soft. He was labeled insufficiently radical, in some
ways as insufficiently black. Had he lived, he probably would not
have been remembered later as a holy celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, of course, you can't find a white person who claims to
have hated him or a black person who claims not to have marched
with him. Everybody now says they loved him then. It wasn't so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I May Not Get There With You'' is explicit in recounting
King's ``borrowing'' the words of others in speeches, sermons and
books. It documents King's constant womanizing. But Dyson believes
there are explanations, although not excuses, for King's flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preachers always borrow ideas from each other,'' he said.
``That's just the way it was always done. And (King) understood he
was wrong to have women other than his wife. He acknowledged his
weaknesses. In sermons he would emphasize he was not a saint, but a
sinner like everyone listening to him. He was, in fact, a
chauvinist, though I think he would have learned better had he
lived longer.''
</P>
<P>
   King's heroism, Dyson believes, comes from ``pushing the status
quo, pointing out wrongs and insisting things be changed, carrying
on in spite of hate and personal weakness and surely feeling
overwhelmed with the burden of it all. He was an authentic voice
for blacks, and not just with the `I have a dream' speech. I
recommend we take a 10-year moratorium on repeating words from that
speech, so people can see all the other things \RKing\S had to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic, Dyson said, that Ronald Reagan signed papers
mandating King's birthday as a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``King was deeply critical of Reagan,'' who was then governor of
California, Dyson said. ``He represented what Martin Luther King
found reprehensible in public life: a failure to oppose forces
undermining minorities and lower-income Americans. But now
conservatives use (King's) words to support ideas he would have
scorned, portraying him as colorblind and claiming he would have
opposed affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Dyson said, King should be remembered ``as a strong
voice, and evolving voice, that spoke for black Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, however, Dyson said he has no misgivings about
pointing out King's flaws. ``If it makes people think about him,
truly understand him a little, even if their response is to attack
me, then to an extent I've succeeded,'' Dyson said.

RX FOR MAKING THE MOST OF A DOCTOR VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never go to a doctor's appointment alone, and always insist on
getting out of that floppy paper exam gown before attempting any
meaningful discussion.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bottom line from two health-care experts who advise
patients to prepare for a medical appointment with a specific list
of questions and rehearse what they want to ask the physician _ out
loud, in front of a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Better communication spells safer medicine, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Half of people who visit their doctor return home poorly
informed about what ails them and ill-equipped to play a
constructive role in their own healing, say the authors of
``Surviving Modern Medicine: How to Get the Best From Doctors,
Family &AMP; Friends'' (Rutgers University Press, $17 paperback).
</P>
<P>
   Adverse drug reactions, which the health system can prevent by
carefully taking medical histories, have grown into a leading cause
of deaths: 45,000 last year (about equal to highway fatalities).
</P>
<P>
   ``And, they are completely avoidable,'' says Peter Clarke,
professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern
California School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He and Susan Evans, research scientist with USC School of
Medicine's Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention,
have written ``Surviving Modern Medicine'' to help patients
navigate the dangers inherent in a system in which microbiology,
immunology and genetics have gained tremendous ground, while the
arts of listening to a patient and doing a thorough physical exam
have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure your doctor knows all your prescription drugs and
the herbal and nonprescription drugs you are taking,'' Evans says.
``Aspirin can interact with prescription blood-thinners. People say
herbals are `natural,' but so is poison ivy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The authors were in Fort Worth recently to promote the book,
which throws out a lifeline to help consumers survive and perhaps
even thrive on modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent of medical consultations end with prescription
drugs, but half the time drugs are prescribed, the patient doesn't
take them according to how the drugs were prescribed,'' Clarke
says.
</P>
<P>
   Between one-half and two-thirds of patients do not adhere to
prescribed treatment plans, largely because they leave the doctor's
office without understanding what they are supposed to do, Clarke
contends.
</P>
<P>
   They don't pay attention to the timing between doses, the time
of day they take drugs or whether they are supposed to take them
with or without meals. Too often, consumers underdose and overdose
and suspend taking the drug before the prescription runs out, or do
not get a refill in time to prevent running out of an ongoing
medication, so there's a gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seriously compromise treatment by not complying with our
doctor's orders because we haven't asked the questions that nail
down what the doctor actually said,'' Evans says. ``If you are
diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension, you will likely be on oral
medication the rest of your life, but a lot of people take one
round and think they are cured.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Surviving Modern Medicine'' offers tips on how to avoid common
mistakes in choosing among treatment options; how to mobilize
effective support among relatives and friends; how to make certain
your end-of-life wishes are respected; and how to get your doctor
to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   It advises patients to get second opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, when a patient goes into the exam room, he goes
into information shutdown, especially if it is for a serious
diagnostic exam,'' Evans says. ``And, it's accelerated when you put
on that floppy paper gown.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell the doctor you want to get dressed and then talk, she
advises.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a quota system and are under intense pressure to put
patients through the system quickly, but it's a nicety to let you
get dressed before you talk so you don't feel exposed and
vulnerable, subconsciously,'' Clarke says.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a companion. It changes the dynamics. You have a second
voice and a second brain. More questions get asked, more clinical
options presented. You are more secure, so your heart rate is more
normal and more information is processed. You get more physician
time. Quality skyrockets. Never go to the doctor alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great gift we baby boomers can give our parents: go
with them to the doctor,'' Evans urges.
</P>
<P>
   She and Clarke say they wrote the book to help consumers unravel
their confusions and to increase the quality of their medical care
_ indeed, to survive modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to produce an interactive, online version in the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   When you go to the doctor:
</P>
<P>
   Write down your questions and rehearse them beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Bring someone with you for an extra pair of ears.
</P>
<P>
   Take notes so you remember the important stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Don't leave until you ask:
</P>
<P>
   1. What is wrong with me?
</P>
<P>
   2. What tests do I need?
</P>
<P>
   3. What will happen during the procedures?
</P>
<P>
   4. What treatments do I need?
</P>
<P>
   5. What should I do to help myself?
</P>
<P>
   6. When will I feel better?
</P>
<P>
   7. When should I see you again?

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The landscape around your home is important because it can
enhance the home's appearance, and add as much as 15 percent equity
to its value, real estate agents estimate.
</P>
<P>
   A good landscape starts with a wellthought out ground plan.
Before attempting to set anything down on paper, you must first
consider the terrain, the size and shape of the house, the soil
composition and the climate. You should also consider the needs and
requirements of your family.
</P>
<P>
   Start inside the house. Go from room to room and look at the
views from each window. Decide which ones can be enhanced with
greenery and which ones should be hidden. Move outside and walk
around your property. Look carefully at the terrain and evaluate
its good and bad features. Choose areas you want to leave open for
recreation and sections where you want shade. Do you want to set
aside some property for a vegetable garden?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the slope of the land. Ground with a steep pitch is
subject to erosion, and it can be difficult to maintain. In these
areas, it is best to use plants with a spreading root system so
they can hold the soil together. As an alternative, you can terrace
the land by installing retaining walls. Retaining walls are a lot
of work to put in, but they can prevent soil erosion and help cut
down on yard maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Next, consider the house itself. Try walking across the street
and looking at your house and property from a distance. What
features would you like to accent and which would you like to hide?
Does your house reflect a particular architectural period? If so,
you should choose shrubs and designs that complement that period
(this may require some research).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, consider what various shrubs can do for you and how you
want to use them. It is obvious that they can be used to control
soil erosion and create shade, but they can be used in other ways
as well. Shrubs like barberry or escallonia are dense enough to be
used as a windbreak for cold winter winds, or they can be arranged
to funnel breezes toward the house during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some shrubs with thorny leaves, like the purple-leaf Japanese
barberry, can be used as a barrier against trespassers or as
channels to direct people and animals to areas where you want them
to go. Thick shrubs can also be used to insulate the house from
street noises.
</P>
<P>
   Shrubs can be used aesthetically to frame an area, and to create
mood and atmosphere. A shrub like the red-twigged dogwood has
colorful red branches that can add color to a drab winter
landscape. Colorful plants and flowers are especially effective
around the entrance to the house.
</P>
<P>
   Shrubs can be used to accent driveways and walks or to call
attention to a particular architectural feature of the house. You
can add dramatic accents by setting dark green masses against
light-colored flowerbeds. Large shrubs and trees can be used to
ease the transition from the hard lines of a house to the softer,
natural lines of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few things to avoid when drawing up your ground
plan. Driveways and walkways can be accented with shrubs, but these
plants should be low _ hostas are a good choice _ so they do not
obstruct sightlines. This is particularly important at the end of
the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid planting trees too close to the house. As they grow, they
will develop overhanging branches that may provide a pathway to the
roof and chimney for squirrels and other small rodents. Also,
leaves falling from the branches in the fall will collect in the
rain gutters and clog them. For security reasons, do not plant
large clumps of dense bushes near the house. They can provide
effective cover for a burglar attempting a break-in.
</P>
<P>
   When you have your basic plan on paper, visit a nursery and
discuss your plans with specialists. They can analyze the strengths
and weakness of your plan, estimate costs and offer suggestions on
the type of plants that will thrive in your soil and which shrubs
are best for your design.
</P>
<P>
   You can, of course, begin landscaping anywhere on your property,
but it's best to start close to the house because it is the most
important element. Start with foundation plantings. Plant a few
species in repetitive arrangements to create a unified design and
eliminate a cluttered look.
</P>
<P>
   Ground cover like pachysandra, vinca minor and periwinkle are
good choices for the foundation because they absorb runoff from the
roof before it can seep through the foundation into the basement.
When time and money permit, move to adjacent areas to complete your
landscape plan.

   &UR; A Hungry Eye for Cardoons &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have an Italian cookbook that has recipes for cardoons.
They sound delicious, but I can't find them for sale. Can I grow
them in western Pennsylvania, and if so, how?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) is a kind of thistle,
closely related to the artichoke. It's a bit easier to grow, far
lovelier when growing, and equally delicious, with a taste and
texture somewhere between artichoke and chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   But it sure isn't instant. Cardoons take about six months from
seed to table. And although even a beginner can count on gorgeous
plants and beautiful, if heroic, material for the vase, it's a
major project to grow cardoons you can eat.
</P>
<P>
   The plants start with a basal rosette and grow quickly into a
clump of thick-stemmed, silvery-green, saw-toothed leaves that may
be four to six feet tall and about half that wide. The flowers are
large and purple, like artichoke flowers, but in this case you
don't want flowers. Cardoons are grown for the leaf midribs, which
will become tough and bitter if the plant reaches blooming age _
about eight months _ or is forced to bloom by summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they tend to become tough and bitter anyway, so
full-grown cardoons are tenderized and sweetened by blanching
before harvest. Blanch them when the weather cools, in late
September, by loosely tying the outer leaves around the center,
then heaping leaves or straw around the plants to exclude light and
protect from frost. They'll be ready to eat in four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still game? Seed should be started indoors as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Set young plants out in fertile, well-drained soil as soon as
the danger of hard frost is gone; cardoons grow best in cool, damp
weather. Make sure they get plenty of water. Feed with a balanced
fertilizer shortly after you set them out, and again in late
August.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources for cardoon seed are the Cook's Garden, P.O. Box
5010, Hodges, S.C. 29653, (800) 457-9703; and Bountiful Gardens
Seeds, 18001 Shafer Ranch Rd., Willits, Calif. 95490, (707)
459-6410. Both have free catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Exuberance to Spare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last fall, I brought a large mandevilla inside, where it is
in a sunny south window. Should I have cut it back? It seems to be
flourishing, and since it is so large, I hate the idea of touching
it. Although I read it should be kept dry in winter, it seems to
want a lot of water.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of different mandevillas, but from your
description it sounds as if you have the old standby Mandevilla x
amabilis, Alice du Pont, the one with the fuzzy foliage, bright
pink flowers _ and rampant growth habit. It doesn't need to be cut
back to bloom, but since it does need to put on several feet of new
growth to initiate flower formation, you can end up with quite the
tangle if you don't take steps.
</P>
<P>
   Mandevillas are tough plants and will come back after severe
pruning, after drought that makes them drop all of their leaves,
after winters in the cellar. By continuing to water (and perhaps
feed?) yours, you have prevented the semidormancy that helps ward
off total takeover. ``It will become unmanageable when it starts
active growth again,'' said John Enterline, the indoor display
specialist at Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., adding that
you should expect that quite soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to put on at least three or four feet of new
tendrils,'' he explained, ``six or eight if it was a good-sized
plant to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   The flower buds form on the old wood, so you don't want to cut
it back by more than about half. An open structure that lets in
light and air is best, Enterline said, in part because that makes
it easy to fight off the mealybugs that often prey on indoor
mandevillas.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late to get out the shears. Enterline said ideal
pruning time is January to February for May blooms. By pruning now,
you'll delay flowering until June or July. But flowers will come,
and when they do they'll do so on a healthier, handsomer plant.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. If the Universal Serial Bus is so universal, why are there
both powered and nonpowered hubs available for adding USB devices?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most current PC's and Macintoshes have only two USB ports
available. To plug in more than two USB products at a time, you can
attach a hub _ a small, multiport connection device _ to one of the
existing ports to add four, six or however many more USB ports you
need. Most basic hubs have four USB ports, and you can add up to
127 USB devices to your computer by linking hubs upon hubs.
</P>
<P>
   The type of hub you need, either a powered one that also has to
plug in to an electrical outlet or one that doesn't, depends on the
types of devices you are using. Some USB peripherals, like mice and
keyboards, are low-power additions and can draw the energy they
need to operate directly from the USB port. If you have a bunch of
low-powered devices (check your products manual if you're not
sure), you can get away with using a cheaper, nonpowered USB hub to
connect them all.
</P>
<P>
   Things like digital cameras are usually high-power devices and
need more electricity than what the USB port can provide. In such
cases, you will need a powered hub that also plugs into the wall as
well as into your computer to give you the power you need.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have two PC's at home and would like to connect them so
they can both use the cable modem. What do I need to create a basic
home network?
</P>
<P>
   A. Creating your own network, which may sound like a rather
ominous task, can be as simple as connecting two computers together
with a direct cable connection or by their USB ports. That type of
network tends to be slow, and the computers have to be fairly close
together.
</P>
<P>
   The home-network market is booming, and there are several
options available that might give better results with your cable
modem. Computer stores sell a variety of home-networking starter
kits that include enough hardware to connect two computers, plus
specific instructions on the set-up process for the type of network
you've chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Ethernet is one of the most frequently used technologies, and
many companies use it for their office networks for both Windows
and Macintosh computers. A Home Ethernet starter kit costing $80 to
$100 will usually include the Ethernet hub, the proper cables and
the Ethernet add-in cards to hook up two computers.
</P>
<P>
   If your computers are scattered through the house, creating a
network through your home telephone wiring might be a smart choice.
With special adapter cards and software, Home Phoneline Networking
allows you to plug your computer into telephone wall jacks (without
interfering with the use of the telephones) and create a network
that can rival Ethernet speeds. Prices vary, but you should be able
to find a kit for $100 to $150.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless technology is also making inroads into the
home-networking market, although a cable-free network is still a
little pricier than one with wires. Some cost around $400 or more.
Plugging a wireless card into your computer means it does not need
to be near either an electrical outlet or a telephone jack, and
people with laptop computers may enjoy the freedom of being able to
be networked from up to 150 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Home Free Networks (www.homefree-networks.com) from Diamond
Multimedia sells both wireless and phone-line kits, and the site
has a section for frequently asked questions about home networking
for PC's. Linksys.com (www.linksys.com) sells both phone-line and
Ethernet starter kits. Other resources you may want to check out
for general information include the Home Networking home page
(www.home-networking.org) and Cable-Modem.Net's page on home
networks at www.cable-modem.net/tt/networking.html.

STATES TRY ONLINE OPTION FOR DRIVERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the scourges of modern life _ waiting in line at the
motor vehicle department _ may soon be a thing of the past as
states begin to make driver's license renewals, along with motor
vehicle registration and other types of licensing, available
online.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is leading the way, having put its driver's license
renewal program online in January. Colorado, Arizona, Texas and a
handful of other states are expected to have similar programs
operating before the end of the year. Some already offer online
registration of motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Online license renewal not only eliminates the chore of waiting
in long lines, but it also makes the service available 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week, and to residents who are living out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first person we got to renew his license online was
stationed in Fort Benning, Ga.,'' said Richard Holcomb, Virginia's
Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of person we want to help. Otherwise, he would
have had to get a military extension or taken a day off to come to
Virginia to visit one of our offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Holcomb said, the state handles about 30 online license
renewals every day. The cost for renewing online is the same as it
is for renewing in person, and the fee can be paid with a credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   Officials plan to keep adding to the list of services available
online, things like ordering a personalized license plate, filing a
change of address or replacing a lost or stolen license or
identification card.
</P>
<P>
   Eligibility requirements for online license renewal vary
slightly from state to state, but typically a driver with
outstanding traffic violations or anyone who needs to take a
driving test must visit an office for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, anyone who has a medical condition like epilepsy or
a significant vision impairment would have to come into an office
for renewal. About 1 million of the 1.5 million drivers whose
licenses are up for renewal each year are eligible to use the
state's online service.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia, which requires license renewals every five years,
will not allow license holders to renew online twice in a row.
``Every 10 years you'll need to come in and get a new picture and
your eyes examined,'' Holcomb said.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, about a dozen of the state's 711 licenses _ for
things like driving, fishing, camping and real estate sales _ will
be available for online renewal later this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is some concern about the length of time between eye
examinations for some drivers. Marc Holtzman, the state's
technology secretary, and the Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles
are looking into several options for eye exams. One option could be
to have a driver visit an eye doctor for an exam, then have that
doctor also send the file online.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility might be to conduct the eye exam on the
Internet. ``We would have to know whether or not the person taking
the test is the person applying for the license,'' said Don Burton,
program director for driver's licenses services with the Colorado
Department of Motor Vehicles, citing one of the problems with that
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado and some other states require that a driver renewing a
license be fingerprinted. But Burton said that problem might be
resolved by using another method to confirm a person's identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to provide information the driver needs to know,
like a confirmation number or other verifiers that people trying to
renew would have to know,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   He compared it to calling a bank for account information and
being required to give a mother's maiden name or a Social Security
number.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid fraud, Virginia assigns a personal identification
number, or PIN, to a person and mails it to his or her home. ``We
have had a couple of situations where we had to investigate,''
Holcomb said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in Texas called Virginia officials when she got the card
with her PIN, which she had not requested. It turned out that the
woman's Social Security number and birth date had been used by her
sister to get a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always going to have instances where people can abuse
the system,'' Holtzman said, ``and unless we can be persuaded that
the risk of these abuses is higher over the Net, then we are going
to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem that concerns Burton is the ``motor voter''
registration, the piggybacking of voting registration on top of
motor vehicle licensing or registration. Voting registration
requires an individual's signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to see if the county clerks will recognize and accept
an electronic signature,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia has dealt with this problem by creating a voter
registration form that can be filled out online but is then printed
and mailed to a person, who signs it and mails it back.
</P>
<P>
   While online renewals are motivated in part by budget
considerations, it is unlikely that state government jobs will
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers' renewing online, Burton said, ``helps us by having them
not come into an office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one less person we have to deal with or that has to
wait in line,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES _ If everything had gone according to the script, it
would have been a truly arresting venue for a victory bash.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that John McCain would emerge triumphant from his
``Super Tuesday'' showdown with George W. Bush, then crow about it
in the sort of setting most Republicans wouldn't approach if their
lives depended on it: a funky design center in the hottest area for
gay nightlife in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But, as became increasingly clear in the closing stages of the
campaign, that wasn't what the script portended at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did McCain fall far short of his rival, he stumbled
particularly badly in the state where he had hoped for his greatest
popular triumph, California.
</P>
<P>
   And when he appeared beneath the glass and steel atrium of the
Pacific Design Center on Tuesday night, he was met not by a
seething mass of ardent supporters but by a small band of hard-core
cheerleaders vastly outnumbered by the serried ranks of the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hosting a rowdy party, the best McCain could do was
to sound stoic about the body blows Bush had inflicted and try not
to pay too much attention to the echoing empty corridors that
surrounded the small frenzy of attention immediately around him.
</P>
<P>
   The disco music was cranked up to full volume, the silvery
streamers were released and the red, white and blue plastic
pom-poms were distributed to anyone interested.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been convincing but for the forlorn outlying
tables lined with unopened bottles and the hot plates stuffed to
the brim with kosher hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, my friends, we won a few and lost a few today,'' McCain
began. The crowd didn't seem too maudlin about the bad news,
cheering and whelping ``Go, John, go!.'' For his part, McCain vowed
that his ``crusade'' to clean up public life would carry on
regardless. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So at least we now know where we stand. Following the electoral
fireworks of ``Super Tuesday'' _ ``Mega Tuesday,'' as some
commentators took to calling it _ we now know that it is George W.
Bush and Al Gore who will confront each other in the U.S.
presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, who put the liberal cat among the cautious
pigeons, and John McCain, the Vietnam veteran who was unafraid to
call a spade a spade, are both out for the count.
</P>
<P>
   California and New York were among the states that gave the
all-round thumbs-down to Bradley and McCain, who both now look set
to acknowledge the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the two outsiders is a loss for American
politics. Both provided alternative voices that needed _ and need _
to be heard. We are now left with the old Establishment, scarcely
shaken or stirred.
</P>
<P>
   This exciting stage of the primaries will, however, leave at
least a trace. The waters are likely to close over the now-drowning
Bradley, whose main legacy will be a reminder that one has to be
seriously tough in order to become a presidential candidate. Nice
man though he was, he failed that basic test.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by contrast, may have done U.S. politics a lasting favor
with his successes in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, he is not quite the liberal he is sometimes
purported to be. He is a classic conservative on many issues, from
abortion to gun control. But he has shown a sense of morality,
which is in itself to be admired.
</P>
<P>
   He has displayed a conviction that he lives for his beliefs,
rather than because of a craving for power.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments of recent weeks would suggest that this could be
the death of caring conservatism. Bush appears to have thrown his
lot in with the religious right. But there is little evidence that
Bush will prove some intolerant monster.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, he may well be as liberal as McCain would
have been. Nor, despite his apparent eagerness to please the
redneck right in recent weeks, will he necessarily stay painted
into that corner.
</P>
<P>
   This stage of the primaries is notable for forcing people to
define themselves in opposition to their opponents, and to target a
particular niche. Once the field has thinned out, the candidate can
afford to become more all-embracing.
</P>
<P>
   Some things never seem to change. The most notorious moment in
the campaign waged by George Bush (senior) was when he tried to
paint his opponent, Michael Dukakis, as soft on a convicted rapist.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect (as in so many others), George W. appears to be
ready to follow in daddy's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's recent radio ads, McCain stands accused of voting
against research funds for breast cancer _ though even Bush, it now
emerges, does not claim to believe this line. (In reality, McCain's
track record on the voting was at least as good, probably better,
than that of Bush himself.)
</P>
<P>
   It is a pity if straight lies are considered an acceptable form
of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   One source of regret must be that the excitement of the election
has now been punctured. Now that it has turned into a two-man race,
the voters can afford to get truly bored.
</P>
<P>
   Short of unexpected dramas or some especially vile mudslinging,
this may become a wooden campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore or Bush: two dependable pairs of hands on the tiller. The
course looks set to be steady as she goes. &QL;

A FILLING TALE OF `DELICIEUX' MEAT PIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NATCHITOCHES, La. _ There are a few questions that quickly pop
to mind when you pull off the Interstate and travel deep into the
wooded canopy of historic downtown Natchitoches. The foremost
question is, ``How in the heck do you pronounce this place?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is Nack-a-tish, a pronunciation that neither sounds
like nor looks like Natchitoches, an Indian name that means there
are some really good meat pies just this side of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's not a river that runs through it. The Red River
once changed its course and meandered past this northern Louisiana
hamlet, but then the river changed again, leaving a narrow lake.
</P>
<P>
   The second question here is, ``Why all the French influence this
far north?''The answer is that this community is the oldest
permanent settlement in Louisiana. It was founded in 1714 by the
French to promote trade with the local Indians and the Spanish in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the really important question: ``Where do I get one of
those meat pies?''
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone around and they'll direct you to Second Street and
Lasyone's Meat Pie Kitchen and Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   There are other places to get meat pies, but Lasyone's was the
first and it remains the most celebrated. The walls in the entryway
are blanketed with framed magazine covers from Southern Living, The
New Yorker, Gourmet and Glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Columns by prominent food writers such as Calvin Trillin share
the precious space, along with autographed photos of Lorne Greene,
Vanna White, Daryl Hannah, and the cast and crew of ``Steel
Magnolias,'' which was filmed here.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kuralt brought his ``On the Road'' to James Lasyone's
place. ``Good Morning America'' followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really been fortunate,'' Lasyone said of his restaurant's
reputation. ``It was a hit the day it opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Just where meat pies began, no one seems to know. Lasyone said
he has tried to trace their origin, without success. Some people
place their beginnings at the time of the Civil War; others guess
much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that I grew up around here, in the country, and
when we came to town we would buy them off of street carts that had
wood burning in the bottom to keep the pies warm. The pies were a
nickel apiece back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasyone began his business on Second Street in 1967 after 25
years in the grocery business right next door. Things were changing
in Natchitoches. A mall was opening and many of the downtown
businesses were moving. ``They kept telling me I was crazy to stay
here, but I thought it would work.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to borrow money for his new venture, but no one would
go the loan, so he gathered up $3.95 for a small burner and $3 for
a ``little black pot'' and began cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have that pot. It's hanging over the salad bar,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lasyone's Meat Pie Kitchen was the first place in Natchitoches
to offer meat pies. Street vendors and family cooks had made them
for years, but they were never available over the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a doctor who was a customer at the grocery store, and I
sold meat to his mama every week for meat pies,'' Lasyone said.
``She is really where I got the idea to make them in a
restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   He finagled the local recipes and tweaked them a little here and
there; he won't say exactly what goes into a Lasyone meat pie.
</P>
<P>
   While other makers use machines to turn out manufactured pies,
Lasyone proudly insists that his are made by hand. It takes time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell a lot of them during our Christmas festival,'' he
said. ``We begin making them in August, freezing them and getting
them ready. We'll make between 12,000 and 14,000, and that will
barely get us midway through December.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't do mail order _ although he says he could get rich
just selling off the Internet _ but if you bring your own cooler,
he'll help pack it with a little ice and a lot of frozen meat pies.
Texans, he said, are among his most frequent customers.

<P>
   So at least we now know where we stand. Following the electoral
fireworks of ``Super Tuesday'' _ ``Mega Tuesday,'' as some
commentators took to calling it _ we now know that it is George W.
Bush and Al Gore who will confront each other in the U.S.
presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, who put the liberal cat among the cautious
pigeons, and John McCain, the Vietnam veteran who was unafraid to
call a spade a spade, are both out for the count.
</P>
<P>
   California and New York were among the states that gave the
all-round thumbs-down to Bradley and McCain, who both now look set
to acknowledge the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the two outsiders is a loss for American
politics. Both provided alternative voices that needed _ and need _
to be heard. We are now left with the old Establishment, scarcely
shaken or stirred.
</P>
<P>
   This exciting stage of the primaries will, however, leave at
least a trace. The waters are likely to close over the now-drowning
Bradley, whose main legacy will be a reminder that one has to be
seriously tough in order to become a presidential candidate. Nice
man though he was, he failed that basic test.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by contrast, may have done U.S. politics a lasting favor
with his successes in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, he is not quite the liberal he is sometimes
purported to be. He is a classic conservative on many issues, from
abortion to gun control. But he has shown a sense of morality,
which is in itself to be admired.
</P>
<P>
   He has displayed a conviction that he lives for his beliefs,
rather than because of a craving for power.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments of recent weeks would suggest that this could be
the death of caring conservatism. Bush appears to have thrown his
lot in with the religious right. But there is little evidence that
Bush will prove some intolerant monster.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, he may well be as liberal as McCain would
have been. Nor, despite his apparent eagerness to please the
redneck right in recent weeks, will he necessarily stay painted
into that corner.
</P>
<P>
   This stage of the primaries is notable for forcing people to
define themselves in opposition to their opponents, and to target a
particular niche. Once the field has thinned out, the candidate can
afford to become more all-embracing.
</P>
<P>
   Some things never seem to change. The most notorious moment in
the campaign waged by George Bush (senior) was when he tried to
paint his opponent, Michael Dukakis, as soft on a convicted rapist.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect (as in so many others), George W. appears to be
ready to follow in daddy's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's recent radio ads, McCain stands accused of voting
against research funds for breast cancer _ though even Bush, it now
emerges, does not claim to believe this line. (In reality, McCain's
track record on the voting was at least as good, probably better,
than that of Bush himself.)
</P>
<P>
   It is a pity if straight lies are considered an acceptable form
of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   One source of regret must be that the excitement of the election
has now been punctured. Now that it has turned into a two-man race,
the voters can afford to get truly bored.
</P>
<P>
   Short of unexpected dramas or some especially vile mudslinging,
this may become a wooden campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore or Bush: two dependable pairs of hands on the tiller. The
course looks set to be steady as she goes. &QL;

 &HT;    TEXANS UNITE TO FIGHT FOR FEDERAL RESEARCH FUNDS
 &HT;    Attn: Texas points.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Texas congressional delegation pledged
Wednesday that it would try to help the state's universities and
colleges scoop up a bigger share of the fast-rising tide of federal
research dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned when I learned that, with the excellent research
facilities we have, and with Texas as the second largest state,
nevertheless, we rank sixth in research dollars to our universities
from the federal government,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, sixth is not good enough,'' Hutchison said at the
end of a 90-minute ``higher education summit'' she convened for
Texans from Congress and educators led by the chancellors of the
University of Texas, Texas A&AMP;M, the University of Houston and Texas
Tech systems.
</P>
<P>
   During their strategy session in the Capitol's Lyndon B. Johnson
Room, they agreed by consensus to pursue a common goal: ``The
chancellors and the delegation will strive to place Texas among the
top three states with regard to participation in federal research
activities by the year 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bipartisan effort,'' stressed Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, a
Democrat from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Between the 1991 and 1998 fiscal years, Texas got $846 million
of the $16 billion that federal departments and agencies spent on
university-based science and engineering research, according to the
National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   It ranked sixth each year, far behind behind California ($2.3
billion) and New York ($1.3 billion). The three states most
vulnerable to a surge by Texas are Maryland ($993 million),
Pennsylvania ($961 million) and Massachusetts ($939 million), which
jockeyed back and forth between third, fourth and fifth places in
those years.
</P>
<P>
   Together the six states sucked in 54 percent of the federal
government's university-based research funds. Texas officials have
estimated that every federal dollar spent on research generates
more than three dollars in economic activity within the state.
</P>
<P>
   As a first step, the educators agreed to assemble an inventory
of the research capabilities of all Texas colleges, research
centers and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they would arrange for the educators to get
briefings from federal agencies with similar research priorities.
Since the squeaky wheel often gets the grease in Washington, that
could help them get more of the agencies' discretionary grants.
</P>
<P>
   Direct lobbying can't increase the state's share of competitive
grants, because those grants are awarded on the basis of the
recommendations of panels of senior researchers at prestigious
institutions in each field.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, the lawmakers plan to fight for higher funding
of grant competitions in which the unique research capabilities of
Texas institutions would give them an excellent chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Among the examples mentioned at the meeting:
</P>
<P>
   _ Because Texas has world-class medical research centers, it
would benefit from plans to double the $7 billion in annual
research spending by the National Institutes of Health over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   _ More emphasis on research into bioterrorism and chemical
warfare could help Texas A&AMP;M, the University of Texas and Texas
Tech, which have expertise in areas ranging from biochemistry to
counter-terrorism training for fire and police departments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extra funding in their specialties could help research by
Prairie View A&AMP;M on goats, Texas A&AMP;M on carrots, and the University
of North Texas on high school math.
</P>
<P>
   The past fund-grabbing success of researchers in California and
New York helped them elbow Texas aside in the scramble for more
federal dollars, Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the chicken and the egg,'' Hutchison said.
``California hired the best people, who got more federal funding,
which was used to hire more of the best people.''
</P>
<P>
   Public universities employ eight Nobel laureates in Texas and 19
in California, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has two top-tier research institutions (University of
Texas at Austin and Texas A&AMP;M at College Station), while California
has 10. That status is based largely on the number of doctoral
degrees awarded in different fields and the amount spent on
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston, San Antonio and Dallas are the only cities among the
nation's 10 largest that don't have a Tier One research
university,'' Arthur Smith, chancellor of the University of Houston
System said at the summit. He said that states with more top-tier
research universities attract more federal research funds.

 Dealing with guns at a child's level   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How does a boy become a man? According to news reports, one way
is to take a gun and kill someone.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old boy shot and killed a 6-year-old girl in Michigan,
and became known in news reports as ``the youngest gunman in a
series of deadly school shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that what he wanted to do? Be a gunman? Was he playing
grown-up? Or was he just playing ``Bang, bang, you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you read how he aimed the pistol at one classmate and then
``whirled and fired'' at the little girl? It's like a scene out of
a movie and sounds like the little boy knew the pose.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of kids do, even those whose parents don't allow guns,
real ones or toy versions, in their home. It's almost like they're
born to it, said one mother who was startled to watch her
5-year-old grab a stick, wrap his two hands around it, stretch his
arms out straight and squint at a target.
</P>
<P>
   They're so quickly acculturated to gunplay. They don't know how
to tie their shoes but they know how to whirl and fire like a
character on ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time kids pick up guns, we wring our hands over how often
they're exposed to violent images. And while it sounds like this
little boy lived in a more perilous environment than most, all kids
are early learners in gunplay. They get it from movies, TV and
computer games, and they're great copycats.
</P>
<P>
   Kids play ``guns.'' They always have, people say, fondly
remembering their own Davy Crockett rifle. But you know,I think
people were smarter then. Either that or we've allowed kids to
become terribly confused. Now that there's been this horror in
Michigan, what will we do?
</P>
<P>
   Probably the usual. We'll speak of our shock and outrage and
then get into a nowhere debate over gun control. Children shoot
children, a couple of politicians declare it ``a wake-up call'' and
then we all go to sleep again.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not confident anymore that adults can fix this problem. I
think our generation is beyond learning. We're a gun-happy society.
Since we obviously can't separate adults from their guns, we'll
have to try re-educating our kids.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a radical idea, taken from the anti-war stalwarts who
every Christmas try to encourage parents not to buy toy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   We ban toy guns. We take a stand against all forms of gunplay.
We say that pretend violence is messing up our kids and we do what
we can to make all guns, make-believe and otherwise, unattractive
to kids.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen? A lot of kids would probably throw a fit
about giving up their plastic pistols, but they'd get over it.
Children are more flexible than adults. Right after the Michigan
shooting, one expert remarked on how kids can be squabbling one
minute and hugging each other the next. Except that this time a
real gun intervened.
</P>
<P>
   The toy gun lobby would protest but on what grounds, that every
American child has the right to play shoot-em-up?
</P>
<P>
   Think about this. We allow kids to play with toys guns, but
expect them to not go near the real thing. But, still they do. They
don't grab our car keys from the table and take the mini-van out
for a joy ride, but they itch to grab a gun. They're mimicking the
adult world's own fascination.
</P>
<P>
   Would we let them play with toy condoms? Would we give them
pretend cigarettes to smoke and make-believe booze bottles to swill
from? Absurd, of course, but why tantalize them with a toy that
looks like it could wipe out the neighborhood? Out of curiosity I
went to a gun show not long ago and visited a booth full of toy
guns. They were bright, big and very believable. They were not for
shooting pretend squirrels. They were for shooting pretend human
beings without having to reload for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The salesman told my companions and me that kids love them. Why,
we asked, and he said because they look so authentic.
</P>
<P>
   The small suspect in Morris Township, Mich., hardly seemed to
know what had happened, authorities said after the shooting. The
county prosecutor said the first-grader probably understood that
what he did was ``naughty,'' but didn't understand ``the gravity or
seriousness'' of his act.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he didn't understand that real guns really kill or what
killing means. Death is a pretty difficult concept for a
6-year-old. Parents find it hard to tell small children that when
people die they don't come back.
</P>
<P>
   This little girl is never coming back. And this little boy isn't
either. We want to protect our children. But we encourage their
fascination with killing. If we're going to let this go on we
better come up with an age appropriate term for ``gunman.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunbaby? I guess we'll get used to it.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If the laws of economics were enforced as strictly as the laws
of physics, America would be a workers' paradise. The supply of
most kinds of labor is low, relative to the demand, so each worker
should be treated as a cherished asset, right?
 &HT;    But there have been only grudging gains in wages over the last
few years, and in the realm of dignity and autonomy, a palpable
decline.
 &HT;    In the latest phase of America's one-sided class war, employers
have taken to monitoring employees' workplace behavior right down
to a single computer keystroke or bathroom break, even probing into
their personal concerns and leisure activities.
 &HT;    Sure, there's a job out there for anyone who can get to an
interview sober and standing upright. The price, though, may be
one's basic civil rights and _ what boils down to the same thing _
self-respect.
 &HT;    Not that the Bill of Rights ever extended to the American
workplace. In 1996, I was surprised to read about a grocery store
worker in Dallas who was fired for wearing a Green Bay Packers
T-shirt to work on the day before a Cowboys-Packers game.
 &HT;    All right, this was insensitive of him, but it certainly
couldn't have influenced his ability to keep the shelves stocked
with Doritos. A few phone calls though, revealed that his firing
was entirely legal.
 &HT;    Employees have the right to express their religious preferences
at work, by wearing a cross or a Star of David, for example. But
most other forms of ``self-expression'' are not protected, and
strangely enough, Green Bay Packer fandom has not yet been
recognized as a legitimate religion.
 &HT;    Freedom of assembly is another right that never found its way
into the workplace. On a recent journalistic foray into a series of
low-wage jobs, I was surprised to discover that management often
regarded the most innocent conversation between employees as
potentially seditious.
 &HT;    A poster in the break room at one restaurant where I worked as a
waitress prohibited ``gossip,'' and a manager would hastily
disperse any gathering of two or more employees. At the same time,
management everywhere enjoys the right to assemble employees for
lengthy anti-union harangues.
 &HT;    Then there is the more elemental and biological right _ and
surely it should be one _ to respond to nature's calls. Federal
regulations forbid employers to ``impose unreasonable restrictions
on employee use of the facilities.''
 &HT;    But according to Marc Linder and Ingrid Nygaard, co-authors of
``Void Where Prohibited: Rest Breaks and the Right to Urinate on
Company Time,'' this regulation is only halfheartedly enforced.
Professionals and, of course, waitresses can usually dart away and
relieve themselves as they please.
 &HT;    Not so for many cashiers and assembly-line workers, some of
whom, Linder says, have taken to wearing adult diapers to work.
 &HT;    In the area of privacy rights, workers have actually lost ground
in recent years. Here too the base line is not impressive _ no
comprehensive right to personal privacy on the job has ever been
established.
 &HT;    I learned this on my first day as a waitress, when my fellow
workers warned me that my purse could be searched by management at
any time. I wasn't carrying stolen salt shakers or anything else of
a compromising nature, but there's something about the prospect of
a purse search that makes a woman feel a few buttons short of fully
dressed.
 &HT;    After work, I called around and found that this too is generally
legal, at least if the boss has reasonable cause and has given
prior notification of the company's search policies.
 &HT;    Purse searches, though, are relatively innocuous compared with
the sophisticated chemical and electronic forms of snooping adopted
by many companies in the '90s.
 &HT;    The American Management Association reports that in 1999 a
record two-thirds of major American companies monitored their
employees electronically: videotaping them; reviewing their e-mail
and voice-mail messages; and, most recently, according to Lewis
Maltby, president of the Princeton-based National Workrights
Institute, monitoring any Web sites they may visit on their lunch
breaks.
 &HT;    Nor can you count on keeping anything hidden in your genes. A
growing number of employers now use genetic testing to screen out
job applicants who carry genes for expensive ailments like
Huntington's disease.
 &HT;    But the most ubiquitous invasion of privacy is drug testing,
usually of urine, more rarely of hair or blood. With 81 percent of
large companies now requiring some form of drug testing _ up from
21 percent in 1987 _ job applicants take it for granted that
they'll have to provide a urine sample as well as a resume.
 &HT;    This is not restricted to ``for cause'' testing _ of people who,
say, nod or space out on the job. Nor is it restricted to employees
in ``safety-sensitive occupations,'' such as airline pilots and
school-bus drivers.
 &HT;    Workers who stack boxes of Cheerios in my local supermarkets get
tested, as do the editorial employees of The New York Times
Magazine, although there is no evidence that a weekend joint has
any more effect on Monday-morning performance than a Saturday-night
beer.
 &HT;    Civil libertarians see drug testing as a violation of our Fourth
Amendment protection from ``unreasonable search,'' while most
jobholders and applicants find it simply embarrassing.
 &HT;    In some testing protocols, the employee has to strip to her
underwear and urinate into a cup in the presence of an aide or
technician, who will also want to know what prescription drugs she
takes, since these can influence the test results.
 &HT;    According to a recent report from the American Civil Liberties
Union, drug testing has not been proven to achieve its advertised
effects, like reducing absenteeism and improving productivity. But
it does reveal who's on antidepressants or suffering with an
ailment that's expensive to treat, and it is undeniably effective
at weeding out those potential ``troublemakers'' who are too
independent-minded to strip and empty their bladders on command.
 &HT;    Maybe the prevailing trade-off between jobs and freedom would
make sense, in the narrowest cost-benefit terms, if it contributed
to a more vibrant economy. But this is hardly the case.
 &HT;    In fact, a 1998 study of 63 computer-equipment and
data-processing firms found that companies that performed both
pre-employment and random drug testing actually ``reduced rather
than enhanced productivity'' _ by an eye-popping 29 percent,
presumably because of its dampening effect on morale.
 &HT;    Why, then, do so many employers insist on treating their workers
as a kind of fifth column within the firm? Certainly the government
has played a role with its misguided antidrug crusade, as has the
sheer availability of new technologies of snooping.
 &HT;    But workplace repression signals a deeper shift away from the
postwar social contract in which a job meant a straightforward
exchange of work for wages.
 &HT;    Economists trace the change to the 1970s, when, faced with
falling profits and rising foreign competition, America's
capitalists launched an offensive to squeeze more out of their
workers. Supervision tightened, management expanded and
union-busting became a growth industry.
 &HT;    And once in motion, the dynamic of distrust is hard to stop.
Workers who are routinely treated like criminals and slackers may
well bear close watching.
 &HT;    The mystery is why American workers, the political descendants
of proud revolutionaries, have so meekly surrendered their rights.
Sure, individual workers find ways to cheat on their drug tests,
outwit the electronic surveillance and sneak in a bit of ``gossip''
here and there.
 &HT;    But these petty acts of defiance seldom add up to concerted
resistance, in part because of the weakness of American unions. The
AFL-CIO is currently conducting a nationwide drive to ensure the
right to organize, and the downtrodden workers of the world can
only wish the union well.
 &HT;    But what about all the other rights missing in so many American
workplaces? It's not easy to organize your fellow workers if you
can't communicate freely with them on the job and don't dare carry
union literature in your pocketbook.
 &HT;    In a tight labor market, workers have another option, of course.
They can walk. The alarming levels of turnover in low-wage jobs
attest to the popularity of this tactic, and if unemployment
remains low, employers may eventually decide to cut their workers
some slack.
 &HT;    Already, companies in particularly labor-starved industries like
ski resorts and software are dropping drug testing rather than lose
or repel employees. But in the short run, the mobility of workers,
combined with the weakness of unions, means that there is little or
no sustained on-site challenge to overbearing authority.
 &HT;    What we need is nothing less than a new civil-rights movement _
this time, for American workers. Who will provide the leadership
remains to be seen, but clearly the stakes go way beyond ``labor
issues,'' as these are conventionally defined.
 &HT;    We can hardly call ourselves the world's pre-eminent democracy
if large numbers of citizens spend half of their waking hours in
what amounts, in plain terms, to a dictatorship.

BRADLEY WILL DROP OUT OF RACE, AIDES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: May be updated.) 
(lh) 
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Campaign aides said Wednesday that Bill Bradley has decided to
end his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination after a
string of primary losses to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said that senior officials with the Bradley campaign
were spending the day drafting an announcement and a speech for
Bradley that would sum up his campaign and the goals he set.
Bradley is to deliver the speech on Thursday, but his campaign
officials said they had not decided the place or the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has said that he will support the vice president's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's decision comes a day after Gore wrapped up his party's
presidential nomination with a sweep of primary and caucus
victories from New York to California.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley began his challenge for the Democratic Party nomination
in January 1999 and, to the surprise of many, quickly matched Gore
in both money and message. But he never came close to overcoming
the vice president's advantages _ the power of incumbency, the
support of a popular president and a solid following among the
women, minority groups and labor unions that are the bedrock of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign was also hurt by the rise of Sen. John
McCain, who, in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination
against Gov. George W. Bush, attracted a solid following of
independents and some Democrats _ voters who might otherwise have
gravitated toward Bradley _ in the early open primaries.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Bradley hammered away at Gore over campaign
finance reform and abortion rights, while putting forth his ideas
on health care, fighting poverty and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that at this moment in history we must create a new
politics in America,'' Bradley said in a speech last month in New
York City. ``We must sweep away the old politics of distortion and
money and special interests and create a new politics of honesty
and conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   But his message failed to gain traction with the masses of
voters, and much of his popularity was drawn from his previous
pursuits: as a U.S. senator from New Jersey from 1979 to 1996 and
as a star in the National Basketball Association with the New York
Knicks from 1967 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's decision to drop out came after he was pummeled by
Gore in a series of primaries on Tuesday. But for most observers,
including some within the Bradley camp, that outcome was pretty
much shaped a week earlier _ on Feb. 29 _ after Bradley gambled and
lost badly on a popularity vote in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to break Gore's undefeated streak and to gain some
momentum, Bradley spent an unusual amount of time and money in
Washington, trying to win a race where there were no delegates at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   On most of the Democratic Party's core issues _ abortion rights,
support of affirmative action, environmental protection and gun
control _ voters felt that the 66-year-old Bradley and Gore were in
sync. But Bradley attempted to undercut the vice president by
questioning his level of commitment to some of those issues.

 &HT;    POPE'S VISIT, 'OPERATION: OLD FRIEND,' ISRAEL'S BIGGEST SECURITY
CASE
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Calling it ``Operation: Old Friend,'' Israeli
officials are planning the biggest security detail in the country's
history for the visit of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most complicated, largest and most sophisticated
security operation of VIP protection that we've ever had,'' Israeli
Police Brigadier General David Tsur told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tsur, 40, is an anti-terrorism specialist who spent a year
consulting with the Georgia Department of Public Safety for the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta. He oversaw Israeli security on the turn
of the millennium and is lead coordinator for the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   He said the visit is a much tougher case than visits of U.S.
President Bill Clinton. Clinton, Tsur said, moves quickly and
usually just attends closed meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, on the other hand, will hold public masses and travel
at low speeds so he can be viewed in his so-called ``Pope mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit is also tougher for its duration. The pope is
scheduled to visit Israel and the Palestinian Authority for six
days beginning March 21. He will spend every night in Jersualem,
but will make a day trip to Bethlehem where security will be
handled by the Palestianian Authority. It is the first visit by a
pope to the region since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay, the 79-year-old pontiff is expected to fly to
events in an Israeli Black Hawk helicopter. He is to move in the
narrow stone streets of Jerusalem's Old City in a specially made
mini-Pope mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are currently constructing ramps to smooth out the
stepped paths of the Old City. They are also rushing to finish
seating and staging for an outdoor mass the pope will conduct near
the Sea of Galilee. About 100,000 people are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Tsur said 18,000 police will work during the visit, out of the
national force that has just 26,000 people, including
administrative staff. About 4,000 Israeli soldiers will join them.
</P>
<P>
   He said the visit will cost Israel nearly $10 million, not
including salaries for those involved.
</P>
<P>
   Tsur came to Marietta, Ga., in 1995 with his wife and three
children to consult in the Olympics security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics were bigger, larger, more complicated,'' he said,
``But the pope is a target.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Tsur said that police had no knowledge of any specific
threats against the pope.

LISTEN UP, ALL YOU HOCKEY PUCKS!
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
.MDNM/By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the most part, hockey fans _ goooooooo Stars! _ have been
playing the same hockey video games for a few years. Except for the
overlooked, incredibly animated Wayne Gretzky titles for the
Nintendo 64, most of 'em have been pretty been-there-played-that,
and that goes for EA's onetime influential NHL series, which hasn't
seemed to change since the Colorado Avalanche won the cup.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Dreamcast did with its groundbreaking/shaking NFL
and NBA2K titles, Sega has again changed the rules, pushed the
envelope, blown everyone else away with NHL 2K (Sega for Dreamcast,
$55, all ages). Simply put, there's not a better hockey vid game.
</P>
<P>
   First, the graphics are impeccably detailed, right down to glass
reflections, ice scrapes and skate sprays. The players look like
their real-life counterparts: goatees, beer bellies and all. And
all 27 arenas are perfectly reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   The play-by-play commentary by Hall of Famer Bob Cole and color
commentary by former NHL coach Harry Neale is consistently
accurate; Cole's voice rises and falls as the gameplay does, and
Neale's rattling of NHL factoids is as interesting as it is
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   And if you like options, NHL2K's got plenty, from the usual
(building your own player) to the unusual (playing in a 1920s
uniform). Other options include speed adjustment, camera angles and
a bunch of other stuff that I can't think of right now because I
have five minutes to turn this thing in.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, a few problems. When a player is penalized,
sometimes the jersey name doesn't match the player. I was playing
as the Stars' Mike Modano and I checked that Colorado wimp Joe
Sakic. When the whistle got blown, it wasn't Modano's name on the
jersey of the player being sent to the box. This is a technical
glitch, but one worth mentioning _ and, hey, Sega, fixing!
</P>
<P>
   There's also a problem with automatic line changes. Two things:
If you're letting the computer do the changes, chances are they're
gonna happen at the most crucial moments, like during a breakaway.
Also, when the computer does the changes, a box letting you know
what line's coming in appears on the screen, way too often getting
in the way of the action. And, believe me, you don't wanna miss a
second.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems as if all I write about are games in which players
drive around in souped-up cars and blow stuff up, well, it's
because that's all game companies send me. Add to that list
Vigilante 8: Second Offense (Activision for N64, $60, ages 13 and
up), another seek-and-destroy game, but one with an interesting
twist.
</P>
<P>
   And that is: This takes place during the '70s, which means you
get to race around and maim Bee Gees-era cars. There's a goofy
future-meets-past story line, but trust me, it's not worth getting
into. Just keep hitting ``start'' until the explosions begin, just
like you always do.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I sometimes miss the old days, when offices operated on the
feudal system. There was the boss, or liege lord, who occasionally
dispensed favors _ raises, that is _ but more often withheld them.
For his gaze to fall upon you was supposed to be reward enough.
 &HT;    There were the knights, in their three-piece armor of worsted
and sharkskin, and beneath them the courtiers _ the toadies and
rumormongers who pored over the entrails of the wastebasket, in
hope of clues to the lord's disposition.
 &HT;    There were the executive ladies-in-waiting, with their white-out
and their carbon paper _ this was really back in the dark ages,
before the Xerox machine even _ and there were the handmaidens,
recent graduates of Seven Sisters colleges, dewy and bright-eyed
and as renowned for their pulchritude as for their ability to type
60 wpm.
 &HT;    The whole system depended on everyone's knowing his or her
place, and on not presuming to rise above it. As a newly enrolled
serf, I once made the mistake of speaking in the elevator to one of
my betters, a man with the rank, roughly, of baron.
 &HT;    ``Nice day,'' I said.
 &HT;    He looked at me in silence while the elevator ascended with
excruciating slowness and then, just as he was getting out, he
turned and said to me over his shoulder, ``Young man, you certainly
have a way with words.'' It was two years before he spoke to me
again.
 &HT;    That was nothing. This same man had not spoken to one of his
fellow barons for so long that no one in the office, including the
two of them, could any longer remember what had occasioned the
rift.
 &HT;    The higher-ups didn't need to speak much _ they ruled by means
of the death glance: a look so withering and severe that it would
bore right through you.
 &HT;    I remember the old hallways, in fact, as a place of almost
churchly quiet, punctuated by an occasional mighty door slam or
wastebasket kick. (Unlike the wimpy vinyl receptacles of today,
feudal wastebaskets were made of galvanized metal, and when an
executive wingtip connected, they rang like bells.)
 &HT;    But oppressive though it was, the feudal office was a place you
could rely on. If you were patient and kept your nose clean, you
could slowly, almost effortlessly, rise from serf to squire and
maybe even all the way to knight, in which case you too would be
entitled to quaff bowl-size martinis at midday.
 &HT;    The great secret back then was that nobody was expected to work
very hard. And feudalism was for life: People were almost never
fired.
 &HT;    On my first job, I knew of only one person who had ever been let
go, and it was because he had bitten someone (not, thank goodness,
a member of the firm). A senior lady-in-waiting was once gently
ushered doorward with a retirement party and a silver tray. The
very next day she reported for work as usual, and as usual no one
said a word.
 &HT;    The longevity and durability of the old system was such that it
fostered self-replication. I was so often on the receiving end of
the death glance that in time I mastered it myself. Only by then it
was too late; feudalism was over.
 &HT;    Almost overnight, it seems, the operating model has changed. No
longer a place of vassalage, the office is now a family, a home
away from home, where communication is almost constant and meanness
and hurtfulness are frowned upon.
 &HT;    Memos and e-mail messages flood in like the tide, many of them
generated by the newly empowered Department of Human Resources _
formerly the personnel office, a place where paper went in but
never came out.
 &HT;    Upon boarding the elevator, you are now practically obliged to
remark upon the weather. Before disembarking, the well-adjusted
worker will also wish that all and sundry ``have a good one.'' In
between stops, people actually carry on conversations. They
exchange medical information of sometimes astonishing frankness,
and they also talk a great deal about food and where they're going
to have lunch or dinner.
 &HT;    In feudal days, the topic of food seldom came up and people
didn't really go to lunch in the modern sense of the word _ they
just just slipped away at noontime.
 &HT;    The new candor and friendliness go only so far, however. There
are still things that are never to be spoken of: money, for one, a
subject especially fraught now that cyberbucks have so thoroughly
destabilized the paycheck.
 &HT;    And it is not good form to worry out loud about the most
essential truth of the office family: namely, that it is temporary
and provisional. Whole branches of it could be gone tomorrow,
grafted on to some other family somewhere else or sent home to
become ``consultants.''
 &HT;    Of course, despite the 401(k)s and the profit-sharing plans and
the presence of on-site coffee bars, pool tables and rec rooms, it
is still OK to complain about the boss. Or it would be if only we
knew who he was.
 &HT;    The most unsettling thing about the modern office is the way
that what used to be a hierarchy has turned into a flow chart, with
lines of command so various that they resemble circuit boards.
 &HT;    The guy with the sharp suit and the alligator briefcase might be
written off for his hopelessly corporate mind-set, while the
janitor who has been around since the start-up days might be
sitting on a stack of stock options.
 &HT;    And the most successful and important people, you can't help
noticing, are the ones who, tethered only by laptop and cell phone,
don't actually come into the office very much at all. They clearly
know something that the rest of us don't.

 &HT;    The great secret back then was that nobody was expected to work
very hard. And feudalism was for life: People were almost never
fired.
 &HT;    On my first job, I knew of only one person who had ever been let
go, and it was because he had bitten someone (not, thank goodness,
a member of the firm). A senior lady-in-waiting was once gently
ushered doorward with a retirement party and a silver tray. The
very next day she reported for work as usual, and as usual no one
said a word.
 &HT;    The longevity and durability of the old system was such that it
fostered self-replication. I was so often on the receiving end of
the death glance that in time I mastered it myself. Only by then it
was too late; feudalism was over.
 &HT;    Almost overnight, it seems, the operating model has changed. No
longer a place of vassalage, the office is now a family, a home
away from home, where communication is almost constant and meanness
and hurtfulness are frowned upon.
 &HT;    Memos and e-mail messages flood in like the tide, many of them
generated by the newly empowered Department of Human Resources _
formerly the personnel office, a place where paper went in but
never came out.
 &HT;    Upon boarding the elevator, you are now practically obliged to
remark upon the weather. Before disembarking, the well-adjusted
worker will also wish that all and sundry ``have a good one.'' In
between stops, people actually carry on conversations. They
exchange medical information of sometimes astonishing frankness,
and they also talk a great deal about food and where they're going
to have lunch or dinner.
 &HT;    In feudal days, the topic of food seldom came up and people
didn't really go to lunch in the modern sense of the word _ they
just just slipped away at noontime.
 &HT;    The new candor and friendliness go only so far, however. There
are still things that are never to be spoken of: money, for one, a
subject especially fraught now that cyberbucks have so thoroughly
destabilized the paycheck.
 &HT;    And it is not good form to worry out loud about the most
essential truth of the office family: namely, that it is temporary
and provisional. Whole branches of it could be gone tomorrow,
grafted on to some other family somewhere else or sent home to
become ``consultants.''
 &HT;    Of course, despite the 401(k)s and the profit-sharing plans and
the presence of on-site coffee bars, pool tables and rec rooms, it
is still OK to complain about the boss. Or it would be if only we
knew who he was.
 &HT;    The most unsettling thing about the modern office is the way
that what used to be a hierarchy has turned into a flow chart, with
lines of command so various that they resemble circuit boards.
 &HT;    The guy with the sharp suit and the alligator briefcase might be
written off for his hopelessly corporate mind-set, while the
janitor who has been around since the start-up days might be
sitting on a stack of stock options.
 &HT;    And the most successful and important people, you can't help
noticing, are the ones who, tethered only by laptop and cell phone,
don't actually come into the office very much at all. They clearly
know something that the rest of us don't.

 &HT;    Florida man covered Nuremberg and men `just following orders'
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Samuel Grossman looked straight into the
eyes of evil and saw the frightening truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked like ordinary men, like the corner butcher,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   They were butchers _ the loyal underlings Hitler left behind
when he committed suicide at the end of World War II. Grossman, a
young newsman working for the American government, watched from
across the oak-paneled courtroom in Nuremberg, Germany, as they
were called to answer for the Nazi regime's crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trial without precedent, but it was intended to set one
that would stand for all time. The mystery at its core was far
deeper and more disturbing than any whodunit. It was the mystery of
how these ordinary-looking people and others like them could be
responsible for inhumanity on a scale never before seen.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been a scale too vast to capture public attention in
the splashy style of far more common murder and kidnapping cases
that vie for Trial of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``20 Nazi Leaders
</P>
<P>
   Hear War Crime
</P>
<P>
   Charges Recited''
</P>
<P>
   That headline from the opening day was squeezed into one column
on the front page of The Palm Beach Post on Nov. 21, 1945. It got a
bit more prominence than a story about the cost of Thanksgiving
turkeys but less than a story about a stock battle for control of
the FEC Railway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war had come and gone,'' observes Grossman. ``It was
already becoming yesterday's news.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, now 89 and retired to Lake Worth, was in a unique
position to understand. He became a newspaper reporter after
graduating from Yale in 1931, first for the old Newark Ledger and
then for The New York Times. ``My claim to fame is that I was the
last reporter to interview Thomas Edison,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He later became Newark bureau chief for The Times, covering
stories such as the gangland murder of mobster Dutch Schultz and
the sabotage sinking of an Italian merchant ship in Newark's harbor
at the beginning of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Already married and a father of three, Grossman was deferred
from the draft, but he was still eager to go overseas. He'd dreamed
of being a foreign correspondent since childhood. The Times seemed
content to keep him in Newark, but Grossman got word of an opening
in the government's Office of War Information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quasi-propaganda operation,'' he says of the
government agency.
</P>
<P>
   He took the job in 1943 in exchange for a promise that it would
lead to a foreign assignment. In the fall of 1945, soon after the
war ended, Grossman got a quick Berlitz course and a ticket to
Germany. He was to help organize a German-language wire service
that would provide news in the American-occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon after I arrived, I was asked to write a memo about how we
should cover the (Nuremberg) trial,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The memo won him the job of coordinating the agency's coverage.
Grossman went to Nuremberg in southern Germany to begin hiring
German-speaking clerks, rounding up teletype machines and lobbying
the military occupation authorities for other supplies as well as
rooms and food.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was scarce in the war-ravaged region. Other news
organizations, including American newspaper correspondents, would
come to rely on Grossman's logistic arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists came from around the world,'' Grossman says. ``I
had a sense that this was going to be an enormous event.''
</P>
<P>
   International law held governments responsible for atrocities,
but no individuals had been tried for such crimes. Some scholars
questioned the legality of a trial in the absence of specific
statutes. Although there was broad international support for the
idea of punishing Nazi leaders, many (such as Winston Churchill)
thought they should simply be rounded up and shot.
</P>
<P>
   The American government began pushing for a trial even before
the war was over, and the other Allies finally agreed in August
1945 to create an International Military Tribunal with
representatives from each of the victorious powers.
</P>
<P>
   A 24,000-word indictment targeted a range of Nazi leaders from
the obscure (Hjalmar Schacht, minister of economics) to the
infamous (Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy). They were accused of
directing and carrying out the murders of millions in the
Holocaust, as well as waging war on their European neighbors. It
took five hours just to read the charges as the trial opened in the
Palace of Justice on Nov. 20, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began without two of the 22 defendants. Ernst
Kaltenbrunner, chief of secret police, was hospitalized with a
brain hemorrhage. Martin Bormann, Hitler's private secretary and
confidante, was still at large.
</P>
<P>
   The rest sat silent and expressionless, except for Hess, who
doubled over and complained of stomach cramps, and the former
foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, who collapsed. Both were
back the next day when the defendants all pleaded not guilty and
the prosecution began.
</P>
<P>
   The trial continued for more than eight months. Grossman stayed
for just a few weeks; once the coverage was set in motion he moved
on to another assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against the Nazis included thousands of documents,
photographs and films as well as testimony and artifacts.
Grossman's impression of several defendants remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   Hess: ``A very intense man, a little bit crazed. He was staring
into space all the time. There was an intensity in his eyes that
struck me as what you might expect from a deranged man.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Seyss-Inquart, whose many Nazi positions included deputy
governor general of occupied Poland: ``He had a scar down his face.
He looked like a crook. One day they put on a film of a burning
building in the Warsaw ghetto. Germans had set fire to the building
and Jews were leaping out the flaming windows. I looked over at
Seyss-Inquart. He was ducking his head. He was squirming.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermann Goering, chief of the air force and once Hitler's
designated successor: ``People think of him as a fat slob, but he
was an impressive man. He was orating from the floor. He put on a
spirited defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The common defense of the Nuremberg defendants became
sickeningly familiar in the years afterward: They were only
following orders. The outcome of the trial ensured that it would
never be heard again, except as a comedic punch line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial laid down the law that there are some orders so
heinous that it's a crime to carry them out,'' Grossman says.
</P>
<P>
   The verdicts came down in July 1946. Nineteen defendants were
convicted. Twelve were sentenced to death, including Bormann, who
had been tried in abstentia. He was never found. Goering committed
suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill two hours before his scheduled
execution.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the condemned were hanged Oct. 15, 1946, including
Kaltenbrunner, who had recovered from his hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, who gave up newspaper work for public relations after
he returned to America in the late 1940s, was working at a news
bureau in Austria when the trial ended. He remembers reviewing wire
photos of the hanged men. The images were shocking: Blood ran from
the mouths of the dead Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made sure all of our Austrian employees saw those
pictures,'' he says. ``I wanted them to understand what had
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Another view of Nuremberg
</P>
<P>
   Ed Bowley, 82, of Boynton Beach was an Army corporal stationed
in Bamberg, Germany, when the Nuremberg trial began. Bowley had
studied shorthand and typing in high school, a lucky decision that
got him assigned to a clerical job instead of a foxhole. That, in
turn, led to assignments as an editor and writer for various Army
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   His staff credentials from the Lightning Bolt, newspaper of the
U.S. Constabulary, allowed him to wangle a two-day press pass into
the packed and tightly guarded Nuremberg courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Bowley watched as Adm. Karl Doenitz testified about his role as
commander of the German navy and Hitler's successor as head of
state in the final days of the war. Doenitz appeared calm as
prosecutors insisted his submarines refused to rescue American
sailors after sinking their ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a slim man,'' Bowley recalls. ``I bet he didn't weigh
more than 150 pounds. He wasn't that aggressive. He seemed more
complacent than the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence showed Doenitz was an enthusiastic Nazi who knew that
slave labor was being used in shipyards and who continued to wage
war after he knew it was futile. He was sentenced to 10 years in
prison.

 &HT;    The new Boss packs same power, emotion into music as the old one
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ They step out one by one, like actors in a
streetwise drama. There's the man with his hair wrapped tightly in
a bandanna, playing the part of an urban vagabond. There's the
woman with the killer eyes. There's a big, beefy guy whose sharp
suit and shiny shoes tell you he's ready for business. And a few
more characters, wise, knowing, ripe with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the boss. Make that The Boss.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story about family _ a family on stage and a family in
the audience. It's a story about growing old but refusing to give
up the dream. But most of all, it's a story about rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's
reunion tour _ or at least one night of it. Call it a snapshot of
classic rock's last great stand, taken Saturday at a concert in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Well hold still now darlin'
</P>
<P>
   Hold still for God's sake
</P>
<P>
   Cause I got me a promise
</P>
<P>
   I ain't afraid to make
</P>
<P>
   My love, love, love, love, love, love will not let you down
</P>
<P>
   _ From ``My Love Will Not Let You Down''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your point of view, it has taken Bruce Springsteen
three decades to arrive at this concert _ or one year. Three
decades because that's how long this marvelous career has extended,
starting in the beach bars of New Jersey in the early '70s, peaking
in an unforgettable stadium tour in the mid-'80s with the E Street
Band and then quietly subsiding with a mid-'90s solo acoustic tour.
One year because that's how long the E Street reunion tour has been
running.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell the story. Springsteen drew 1.8 million fans
worldwide for the 87 shows he played in 1999. When the 2000 dates
were announced, Boss fever continued. ``There seems to be this
sense of community'' building around the tour, observes Rolling
Stone contributing editor Anthony DeCurtis, who covered the first
U.S. dates. ``People have made an investment in what this music
is.''
</P>
<P>
   So, you'll have to excuse the fans from Orlando _ and countless
others from various cities who travel with the tour Grateful
Dead-style _ if they're a little excited. At a pre-show party in a
downtown Irish pub, about 50 fans have gathered, trading Bruce
T-shirts and memorabilia and singing their Springsteen-inspired
version of a Disney theme song (''Heigh ho, heigh ho, it's off to
Bruce we go... ``).
</P>
<P>
   The excitement even extends to George Ellis, 49, a computer
salesman from Virginia who's been to more than 100 Springsteen
shows, including 12 on this tour. ``No one puts as much passion day
after day, week after week, month after month in a tour as Bruce
does,'' he says unequivocally.
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-CLASS CHAMPION
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Springsteen is playing in a basketball arena
that boasts a corporate sponsor's name, a far cry from the
working-class spirit of rebellion that pervades his music. And
never mind that this city, home to Mickey Mouse, is all about
entertainment as a packaged commodity, the place where the
Backstreet Boys got their start. Even if he's now a 50-year-old
multimillionaire, you'd like to believe that Springsteen, the
Jersey-born son of a bus driver and secretary, still knows the real
backstreets.
</P>
<P>
   And there he is, looking sharp in a pair of black pants, blue
shirt and black vest, a guitar strapped to his back. The crowd
roars its approval. Singer Island's own Clarence Clemons, the
football player-turned-gritty saxophonist _ yes, he's the beefy one
_ begins the evening on a note of reverence. ``Brothers and
sisters, all rise,'' he says, as if anyone was going to stay
seated.
</P>
<P>
   It's 8:24 p.m. when Max Weinberg's power-drum beat sets the
night in motion. The song is ``My Love Will Not Let You Down,''
which creates the right opening mood. The lyrics refer to the love
between a man and a woman, but on this occasion, Springsteen could
just as well be speaking of his love for the fans. For the moment,
his differences with the E Street Band, whose big-bodied sound
defined Springsteen to the point it nearly confined him, have been
set aside. After an 11-year absence, Bruce and the guys (and a
girl, his wife Patti Scialfa, the background vocalist with the
killer eyes) are back.
</P>
<P>
   E STREET BAND STILL HAS PUNCH
</P>
<P>
   The set continues with more uptempo material _ ``Prove It All
Night,'' ``Two Hearts,'' ``Darlington County,'' songs that
practically need a guardrail to keep them from crashing into the
audience. Any questions about whether the band still has it are
immediately forgotten: The rhythm section alone, consisting of
Weinberg, keyboardists Roy Bittan and Danny Federici and bassist
Garry Tallent, might be the greatest that rock has ever produced.
And with the bandanna-wearing Steve Van Zandt and more subdued Nils
Lofgren, two virtuoso guitarists from different E Street eras, on
stage together for the first time, the band has even more
flexibility: Anybody can fill in a lick, including Springsteen. But
The Boss saves his better self for his singing: The voice, still
equal parts sandpaper and soul, carries the night.
</P>
<P>
   Now those memories come back to haunt me, they haunt me like a
curse
</P>
<P>
   Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
</P>
<P>
   Or is it something worse that sends me
</P>
<P>
   Down to the river
</P>
<P>
   _ From ``The River''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: A Springsteen concert is a party. And this
party, filled mostly with revelers in their 30s, 40s and 50s,
carries the heavy burden of nostalgia. Springsteen's fans have
grown old with The Boss; they look to this reunion tour as a chance
to rekindle memories. Pam Thompson, 41, a schoolteacher in suburban
Atlanta who's traveled here with her husband, says if she ever met
Springsteen, she'd have only one thing to say: ``Thanks for keeping
us young.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, this tour is no different from the ones the
Rolling Stones regularly mount _ a chance for geezer rockers and
rock fans to get their jollies, to spit in the face of the
teen-agers who say their music is dated and meaningless. But
there's a difference between Springsteen and the Stones, who favor
elaborate productions and stage antics. Springsteen's concert has
no backdrop or props and the energy that's generated on stage
during his three-hour uninterrupted show is of the honest,
sweat-soaked variety. He also charges about $300 less than the
Stones for his top ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And then, there's the music.
</P>
<P>
   It's only about an hour into the Orlando show when Springsteen
makes it clear that the party must be placed on hold for something
more serious. After a smoky sax solo by Clemons, he offers a
version of ``The River'' that's all pain and regret, as if he's
pouring more salt in the wound of the 20-year-old song. The tale is
classic Springsteen: a factory worker's lament that his best years
have passed him by. But it resonates on a deeper level _ and not
merely because Springsteen has brilliantly reworked the song, as
he's done with many others on this tour. This is no longer about
factory workers: It's about us, how we've grown old, how we've
changed and, yes, how we've come back to the river this night.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening progresses, he offers more of his sparser
material, dedicating ``The Ghost of Tom Joad,'' the title song of
his last studio album, to a group of Florida farm workers fighting
for better pay. Some of Springsteen's fans shift restlessly in
their seats during these quieter moments. But that's the genius of
Springsteen, his ability to blend the power of Elvis with the
thoughtfulness of Dylan. ``He makes music that cannot be denied,''
says Dion DiMucci, the Boca Raton-based Rock and Roll Hall of Famer
who counts Springsteen as a friend. ``Let me put it this way:
There's a difference between being entertained and having a true
emotional experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, before you know it, Springsteen is back in arena-rock
mode, speaking to the crowd like a Pentecostal preacher _ he calls
his religion ``the ministry of rock 'n' roll'' _ and jamming with
the band on numbers such as ``Light of Day'' and ``Born to Run.''
He plays the latter, the song that sparked his early career,
exactly as he recorded it: He's willing to keep the faith.
</P>
<P>
   This train
</P>
<P>
   Dreams will not be thwarted
</P>
<P>
   This train
</P>
<P>
   Faith will be rewarded
</P>
<P>
   _ From ``Land of Hope and Dreams''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen used to end his E Street concerts with a gas-guzzler
like ``Born to Run.'' But that was more than a decade ago. These
days, the band is older and more mature _ and the separation from
Springsteen has allowed the members to pursue different dreams. Van
Zandt, a rocker-turned-actor, stars in TV's hot show, ``The
Sopranos.'' Weinberg leads the band on ``Late Night with Conan
O'Brien.'' Scialfa, who's had three children with Springsteen, has
recorded a critically acclaimed solo album.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculate that Springsteen brought them back because he
wanted to take care of them financially. The theory goes that
they'll head their separate ways once the tour wraps, which has
prompted the Springsteen faithful to buy every ticket available.
``Fear is a big part of it. I'm afraid I'm never going to see Bruce
and the E Street Band together again,'' says Scott Johnson, a beer
importer from Minneapolis who's traveled with the tour from Fargo,
N.D., to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   A TESTAMENT TO LOVE, FRIENDSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Even if the money counts, the band is having too much fun
tonight for a fast buck to be the only motive. No, this is about
something more intangible. You feel as much when Springsteen
gathers them for the evening's penultimate song, ``If I Should Fall
Behind,'' letting each take a turn singing a lyric in this
testament of love and friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the closer, ``Land of Hope and Dreams,'' a
gospel-tinged song about the future. The metaphor here is a train
driving into the distance, carrying with it ``saints and sinners''
and ``losers and winners.'' It stands for everything this night has
represented _ this man, this band, these fans, all gathered
together in the belief that the music must go on. That in this age
of sweeping cynicism, rock can still speak volumes. That the dream
continues.
</P>
<P>
   It's 11:21 p.m. when Springsteen sends the crowd home, reminding
them to contribute to a local food bank collecting money in the
lobby. This train has finally left the station.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FILE 1 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was mentioned on TV that the deepest known spot on Earth
is a trench in an ocean. What ocean? How deep? How was it explored?
</P>
<P>
   A: The deepest known point is the Mariana (sometimes spelled
Marianas) Trench in the western Pacific, near Guam. Sources differ
on the depth, with some putting it at 35,840 feet below sea level,
others at 36,198, and still others at 37,800.
</P>
<P>
   The trench was explored in January 1960 by researchers Lt.
Donald Walsh of the U.S. Navy and Jacques Piccard, a Swiss
scientist, in the Navy's bathyscaph Trieste. The two set a world
ocean-diving record of 24,000 feet Jan. 7 of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few weeks later, they descended to the botton of the
trench in the Trieste. The descent required four hours, 48 minutes;
the ascent, 3 hours, 17 minutes. Facts on File reported that the
later dive broke their own previous record when they reached a
depth of 7.15 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The bathyscaph was a boat-shaped, 75-ton craft 50 feet long and
12 feet wide. A spherical crew chamber 6 1/2 feet in diameter was
attached underneath. At the 37,800-foot depth, the craft withstood
pressure of 16,883.2 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I would like to write members of Congress, is there a
general address to use after their name?
</P>
<P>
   A: To send regular mail, after the name, write: (for
representatives) U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC
20515; (for senators) U.S. Senate, 20510.
</P>
<P>
   To send electronic mail, visit http://congress.org/elecmail.html
and enter either your ZIP code or the person's name where
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The other day, I heard Regis Philbin begin a quote:
``Monday's child is fair in face; Tuesday's child is full of
grace.'' Can you finish this for me?
</P>
<P>
   A: It goes like this: Monday's Child is fair of face, /
Tuesday's Child is full of grace, / Wednesday's Child is full of
woe, / Thursday's Child has far to go, / Friday's Child is loving
and giving, / Saturday's Child works hard for a living, / But the
Child that is born on the Sabbath Day, / Is bonny, and blithe, and
good, and gay!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several years ago, the IRS considered making airline
employees pay income tax on the free airline tickets they received.
Whatever happened with that? Now Delta Air Lines, Ford Motor Co.,
and American Airlines are said to be providing computers to their
employees. Will they be taxed as income?
</P>
<P>
   A: Two subjects, two answers, according to the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Free or discounted flights offered to employees and their
spouses, dependents and parents by airlines are considered non-cash
fringe benefits, and therefore are excluded from an employee's
gross income, said IRS spokesman Mark Green. Details can be found
in IRS Publication 535, Business Expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Computers might be a different story, he added. If they're given
as a gift, they must be included as extra salary or wages unless
they meet the rule of ``De Minimis (Minimal) Fringe Benefit.'' This
benefit is any property or service an employer provides to an
employee that has so little value _ taking into account how
frequently the employer provides similar benefits to its employees
_ that accounting would be ``unreasonable or administratively
impracticable.'' Details on this general topic also can be found in
IRS Publication 535.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I collect the new state quarters, and I've noticed that those
from the Philadelphia Mint seem to be more plentiful in supply than
those from the Denver Mint. The coins from Philadelphia also seem
to be issued first. Is there a reason for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Coins produced by the Philadelphia facility are distributed
mainly east of the Mississippi, those from Denver mainly west of
the Mississippi, said Jennifer Arnold of the U.S. Mint. So it's to
be expected that consumers in the East would see more P marks on
their coins than D marks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coins are produced simultaneously by both mints, Arnold added,
so your contact with them is simply a result of their geographic
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that the world has enough oil reserves to last 100
years or longer. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Estimates about petroleum resources vary considerably, so we
can't say with absolute certainty.
</P>
<P>
   One resource hedges by saying that if present rates of
consumption continue, petroleum may become scace sometime in the
mid 2000s. They key words here are ``may become'' and ``scarce,''
not ``will be'' and ``exhausted.'' This report goes on to say that
the world's oil reserves total about 1 trillion barrels, with some
geologists predicting that additional reserves remain to be
discovered in such places as China, offshore seabeds, and on
Canadian islands.
</P>
<P>
   Another source, meanwhile, reports that the ``most likely''
world oil endowment is 1.7 trillion barrels, of which 32 percent
already has been produced and consumed. If this estimate proves to
be reasonably accurate, current relatively stabilized world
oil-production volumes could be sustained to about 2035, at which
time a shortage of conventional oil resources would force a
production decline.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another resport, published in 1996, said Saudi Arabia alone
had some 260 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, ``enough
to satisfy U.S. oil demand, at current consumption levels, for a
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that predictions are often proved wrong. In 1972,
for example, a report made by an organization called the Club of
Rome predicted exhaustion of the world's oil supplies by 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item reported that Franklin D. Roosevelt, before his
inauguration as president, had been shot in Miami. I don't remember
ever hearing anything about that. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: It happened on the night of Feb. 15, 1933, just after
Roosevelt had finished speaking to a crowd at Bay Front Park in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He was sitting in his open touring car when Giuseppe Zangara, an
unemployed bricklayer, fired six shots at him from about 12 yards.
The president-elect wasn't hit, but the bullets struck five other
people, including Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was standing next
to the Roosevelt car.
</P>
<P>
   Cermak died March 6, and Zangara was indicted the same day.
Zangara pleaded guilty on March 9, and was sentenced to death March
10.
</P>
<P>
   Zangara, who said he had visions of killing ``a great ruler,''
told the court that he would make another attempt to kill Roosevelt
``at once'' if he were freed.
</P>
<P>
   He was electrocuted at the Florida state prison at Raiford on
March 20, 1933. News reports at the time said he was defiant toward
capitalists to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article said the January full moon is known as the
``wolf moon,'' and the one in September is the ``hunter's moon.''
Do those in other months also have names?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. These are commonly listed as the ``traditional names,''
from Native American lore, for each month's full moon: January,
wolf; February, snow; March, worm (or full sap); April, pink; May,
flower; June, strawberry; July, buck (or thunder); August, sturgeon
(or green corn); September, barley (or harvest); October, hunter's
(or harvest, again, because the full moon sometimes falls in
October); November, beaver; and December, cold.
</P>
<P>
   If you're online, check this Web site _
www.7almanac.com/eye/fullmoons.html _ for more detailed, and
colorful, explanations of the names.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently I read that Ted Turner bought two more ranches in
Kansas with a total of 38,239 acres. How many acres in all does he
own in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: About 1.7 million, according to Russell Miller, general
manager of Turner Ranches. His major land holdings are in New
Mexico, Montana, Nebraska and the Dakotas, in addition to some in
the southeastern United States, and total about 1 1/2 times the
size of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as January, Turner bought 90 acres of land along the
Soque River in North Georgia to use as a trout-fishing retreat for
his family.

<P>
   Q: On the ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' TV show, when a
contestant phones a friend for help with the answer, Regis Philbin
always says about the person being called, ``I know you can't see
us now.'' Why can't the person at home see the show as it's going
on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because ``Millionaire'' is taped in advance. So, obviously,
when the person at home sees the broadcast, the question already
had been asked at some earlier time. Since ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' is taped before a live audience at ABC's New York
studio, it can appear to viewers at home that the broadcast is
live.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' show recently featured a rerun of the
Osmond family reunion in December. I missed how many grandchildren
and great-grandchildren there are. Do you know? Also, two brothers
were doing sign language. Are they deaf?
</P>
<P>
   A: George and OIive have 9 children: Virl, Tom, Alan, Wayne,
Merrill, Jay, Donny, Marie and Jimmy. Virl has 7 children and 6
grandchildren. Tom has 9 children and 1 granddaughter. Alan has 8
children (all sons) and 2 granddaughters. Wayne has 5 children and
1 grandson. Merrill has 6 children. Jay has 3 children (all sons).
Donny has 5 children (all sons). Marie has 7 children. Jimmy has 3
children.
</P>
<P>
   So the total is 2 parents, 9 children, 53 grandchildren and 10
great-grandchildren, said Jennifer Wallace of Osmond.com.
</P>
<P>
   The two oldest Osmond sons, Virl and Tom, are hearing impaired.
They were the first deaf missionaries sent out by the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, serving the deaf population in
Canada. They aren't part of the Omond Brothers singing group.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you print the exact wording of the Second Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution, and the generally held interpretation as to
who may possess firearms?
</P>
<P>
   A: Capitalization and placement of commas is subject to
variation, but this is the text (as found in World Book
Encyclopedia, World Almanac and other common resources): A
well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed.
</P>
<P>
   This amendment _ one of 10 known collectively as the Bill of
Rights, which was ratified on Dec. 15, 1791 _ has been interpreted
in two ways. Some people believe it gives ordinary citizens the
right to possess firearms; others believe it only gives each state
the right to maintain its own militia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What health benefits do members of Congress have, and how
much do they pay for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're entitled to participate in the health benefits
program available to all federal employees, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. A number of insurance options are
negotiated with insurance companies by the federal government at a
discount, with no special subsidies involved for members of
Congress. The amount paid varies according to the options.
</P>
<P>
   Outside that program, there are some ``important benefits''
members of Congress get that aren't available to other federal
employees, Sepp said. First, they can avail themselves of the
Attending Physician's Office, which Sepp described as a
``reasonably comprehensive care clinic in the Capitol.'' That
service was free to members until 1992, when they began paying a
nominal fee of $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   And second, they're entitled to receive medical care of an acute
nature, such as surgery, at the Walter Reed Army Hospital and the
Bethesda Naval Hospital. This is ``privileged care,'' Sepp said,
meaning the members are admitted on a priority basis and get
upgraded rooms and greater privacy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book ``Washington: City of Scandals,'' members
of Congress are charged the minimum flat daily rate for stays at
either hospital, even if they require intensive care treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What states have the Powerball lottery?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arizona, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oregon,
Rhode Island, Wisconsin and West Virginia, plus the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where is the ``kudzu line,'' the farthest north that kudzu
can live over the winter?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kudzu might be seen in places are far north as Long Island,
but it doesn't thrive there season after season. It's basically
found in the South. Horticulturist Wayne McLaurin of the University
of Georgia says the clinging vine won't thrive year after year much
farther north Kentucky, Virginia and Maryland because it needs a
long growing season. In colder areas there's not enough time for
nutrients to be put back into the kudzu tubers for future growth,
McLaurin said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Pope John Paul would make an apology for Catholic
treatment in the past regarding persecution, and anti-Semitism in
particular. I haven't seen anything more about it since. Can you
give me an update?
</P>
<P>
   A: The apology will be in the form of a document, titled ``The
Church and the Faults of the Past: Memory in the Service of
Reconciliation,'' which is expected to be read March 12 by the pope
at a ceremony in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, produced by a 28-member Vatican theological
commission, is viewed as an attempt to apologize for 2,000 years of
violence, persecution and ``blunders,'' such as the Inquisition,
the Crusades, and the Roman Catholic Church's treatment of Jewish
people.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of the paper is seen as a centerpiece of the
Vatican's holy year, or jubilee, celebrations, which occur every 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian newspaper La Repubblica has suggested that Pope John
Paul II will go so far as to apologize for the church's failure to
resist the Nazis, but without implicating Pope Pius XII, who has
been accused of ignoring the Holocaust during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives in the Curia, the Vatican's bureaucracy,
meanwhile, have argued that an apology would erode the foundations
of church authority. But they were rebuffed and told that the
jubilee could be celebrated only with ``purification of the
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a Kalashnikov? It was mentioned, without explanation,
in a newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   A: The term refers to a family of automatic assault rifles and
light machine guns, most notably the AK-47. The AK-47 was designed
in 1947 by Mikhail Kalashnikov in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   It fires a rifle-type cartridge at up to 600 rounds per minute
and is one of the most widely distributed automatic rifles in
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Golfer Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland won $1 million at
the Match Play Championship in California. Does he have to pay
taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, since he is not a U.S.
citizen?
</P>
<P>
   A: Without knowing all the details, because exceptions and
extenuating circumstances are always possible, the IRS declined to
address Clarke's case specifically.
</P>
<P>
   But, in general, income earned in the United States by a
resident or non-resident alien is subject to taxation in the same
manner as for a U.S. citizen, said IRS spokesman Mark Green.
Information on the general topic can be found in IRS publication
519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, Green added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I got my first driver's license and registered to vote as a
new 18-year-old bride in 1960. But I read recently that the voting
age wasn't lowered to 18 until 1972. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: You must have lived in Georgia, Kentucky or Alaska. Those
three states permitted 18-year-olds to vote before the 26th
Amendment was ratified in 1971. Three other states (Minnesota,
Montana and Massachusetts) permitted voting at 19, and three more
(Maine, Nebraska and Hawaii) allowed 20-year-olds to vote.
</P>
<P>
   On June 20, 1971, Ohio became the 38th state to ratify the 26th
Amendment, which lowered the minimum voting age to 18 for all
state, national and federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   The new amendment was certified officially in a White House
ceremony conducted by President Nixon on July 5, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the origin of the expression ``the whole nine yards''?
My wife believes it refers to a machine gunner's ammo belt, but I
insist it refers to sail.
</P>
<P>
   A: When Q&AMP;A printed an explanation several years ago, it created
a deluge of theories from readers. Among them: It came from ancient
burial practices in Egypt in which bodies of poor people were
wrapped only in short pieces of silk, but bodies of wealthy people
were fully wrapped, thus taking ``the whole nine yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Another version: The term came from fighter pilots in World War
II whose machine guns used ammo belts in nine-yard lengths, so if
they shot all their rounds of ammunition in a fight, they used
``the whole nine yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, a Scotsman's kilt needs a lot of material, hence, ``the
whole nine yards.''
</P>
<P>
   And still another: It refers to the nine yardarms on a clipper
ship, and when all the sails were being used, it was . . . well,
you know.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these is correct, if you accept the Facts on File
Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins as a resource. It traces
the expression to construction workers, who use the expression when
referring to the maximum capacity of a cement-mixer truck: nine
cubic yards of cement.

 &HT;    Belgian Guffens doesn't waffle on vintage news
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ With Winemaker
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Guffens, everything is I, I, I.
</P>
<P>
   Irascible, irreverent and iconoclastic.
</P>
<P>
   Guffens, a Belgian who moved to France to make a broad line of
high-quality, competitively priced white Burgundy under the Verget
label he founded, dropped into the Winds Wine Cellar in Yellow
Springs last week for a quick luncheon during a five-city, five-day
whirlwind stateside tour.
</P>
<P>
   Disheveled and a bit bleary-eyed after a late-night wine dinner
at the Maisonette the previous night, Guffens stoked up on coffee
and quickly hit his verbal stride.
</P>
<P>
   _ On his frequent clashes with French government officials who
insist that only certain grape varietals be allowed in wines from
certain regions: ``It's only forbidden when you get caught ... I
always prefer to be wrong my way than right someone else's way.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Comparing the quality of the current vintage with past
vintages: ``Here's my definition of a good vintage: It's in stock
and for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Upon hearing that the Wine Spectator had declared one of his
1997 white Burgundies one of the best of the vintage: ``I went down
into the cellars and told some of my assistants, `We must be doing
something wrong.'''

   Though he has attracted worldwide acclaim for the chardonnays he
produces from Burgundy, Guffens is a restless man, so he recently
purchased property in the south of France and has begun bottling
wines under Verget du Sud and Chateau des Tourettes labels.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a fan of rich, oaky, tropical-fruit-scented California
chardonnay, Verget's Burgundy bottlings might not suit your tastes.
But if you're a fan of French whites, Verget's wines are worth
seeking out. Should you see any 1997 or 1996 Vergets still on
shelves, they're worth snapping up. His less expensive 1998s _
bottlings in the $12-$20 range _ are a bit lighter than the
previous two vintages, though a '98 Verget St. Aubin ($23) was
first-class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wine of the Week: Beringer 1996 North Coast Pinot Noir,
$14.99. California pinots have zoomed in price over the last
decade, though they're still cheaper than gasoline (and most of
them taste better). This offering from Beringer is a great buy,
with plenty of fruit, oak and a hint of candy-apple sweetness.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    A decade ago, corporate America tore up the social contract that
bound employees to their companies. Downsizing and re-engineering
made it clear that employees were expendable commodities, not
valued resources. Today, many bright workers are getting their
revenge by fleeing their fickle employers for better-paying rivals
- or dot-com start-ups.
 &HT;    Indeed, quitting has become so fashionable in Silicon Valley
that the turnover rate for companies there has reached an estimated
25 percent a year. The average American 32-year-old has already
worked for nine different companies.
 &HT;    Workers today fantasize not about landing a ``dream job'' but
about having a ``portfolio career'' _ one dream job after the
other.
 &HT;    Is the death of the Company Man something that should be
lamented or celebrated? We asked three leading management experts
to offer their thoughts on loyalty in a virtual age.

 &HT;    JEFFREY PFEFFER

 &HT;    If loyalty is dead in some companies, it's mostly because it has
been murdered by business practices like downsizing at the first
sign of trouble and subcontracting out all ``nonessential''
positions.
 &HT;    The message of ``employability'' _ that a company's only
responsibility to its people is to get them qualified for their
next job _ has clearly registered with the work force. Who can
blame them for acting accordingly?
 &HT;    Today's rapid-turnover arrangements may seem good for the
corporate bottom line, but in fact they make it difficult to build
long-term, sustained success. In an economic environment in which
capital and the latest technology are widely available, the only
hope for building sustained competitive advantage resides in
companies' management of their people.
 &HT;    Thankfully, a few companies like Southwest Airlines, Toyota and
Cisco Systems have retained the wisdom of building profits by
taking care of their people.
 &HT;    Consider SAS Institute, the largest privately held software
company in the world (with annual sales of more than $1 billion).
It has a turnover rate of less than 4 percent. SAS does not
contract out very much of anything, use many part-timers or tell
people they need to think about their next job _ in fact, the
company says that people will have three or four careers during
their working lives and it hopes all will be at SAS.
 &HT;    Nor does it offer stock options, dole out big bonuses or do any
of the other things that companies with toxic workplaces have to do
in order to bribe people into staying.
 &HT;    What SAS does instead is provide generous benefits like on-site
day care, a full-indemnity health insurance plan (bet you thought
this didn't exist any more), a 35-hour business week, recreational
facilities _ as well as something much more important.
 &HT;    While lots of companies say that ``people are our most important
asset,'' SAS actually believes it. People are trusted rather than
monitored and controlled, given great equipment to work with,
permitted to try new things, allowed to have a life as well as a
job and, in short, treated with a respect all too rare in today's
high-stress workplaces.
 &HT;    For SAS, being nice is good business. What happens when you work
while exhausted?
 &HT;    You make errors. SAS actually prefers to ship software that
isn't full of bugs _ what a unique idea! It needs fewer checkers
than other software companies because its employees are awake on
the job.
 &HT;    The organization's low turnover saves it an estimated $70
million annually. Too many companies think that laying people off
or reducing wages is the best way to turn a profit. But loyalty is
central to achieving success.

 &HT;    ROSABETH MOSS KANTER
 &HT;    HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL
 &HT;    We are currently experiencing nostalgia for a golden age of
company loyalty. Yet in too many organizations people were
``loyal'' not because they really cared but because they had no
choice.
 &HT;    Seniority reigned. Status, influence and big pay increases were
tied to promotion. People didn't have stock options _ they had
pension plans that handcuffed them to the company.
 &HT;    The ``loyalty'' that workers seemed to demonstrate by sticking
around was illusory; many of them secretly dreamed of escape and
retired on the job.
 &HT;    Old-fashioned corporate loyalty in which all status and rewards
accrued to seniority stopped being good for the economy when global
competition heated up; productivity and wages stagnated under the
old corporate bureaucracy.
 &HT;    Now that the economy is characterized by high work-force
mobility, productivity is up and wages are rising. With a tight
labor market, the shoe's on the other foot, and in many industries,
it is employees who have numerous opportunities and companies that
are desperate to retain them.
 &HT;    Companies today must offer great jobs in a great environment
with great amenities _ and constantly improve on them. They must
earn loyalty.
 &HT;    Razorfish, a digital design firm, holds people who could go
anywhere by offering exciting work for top clients, a hip corporate
ambiance and larger-than-life amenities, like a Las Vegas trip for
everyone in December.
 &HT;    ``I'd never leave such a cool company,'' a 30-something Web site
producer told me. That is, not until a cooler company comes along.
Razorfish has to think every day about how to stay the coolest.
 &HT;    I think it's a good thing that companies today have to work
harder to keep the best people. The benefits they add make work
more rewarding. Stock options make more people act like owners of
their companies, and that can only benefit performance. And it's
wonderful that companies now recognize that people have lives
outside their work.
 &HT;    Discovering high rates of turnover among female professionals,
Deloitte &AMP; Touche, an accounting firm, took steps to add flexible
schedules and control travel. These changes, useful for men as
well, landed Deloitte in Fortune magazine's Top 10 list of best
companies to work for in America _ helping the firm attract still
more talent.
 &HT;    Some companies earn employee affection by making people proud to
work there. IBM gets high marks from employees because of its major
financial commitment to public education innovations. Timberland
offers its employees 40 hours of paid company time per year to work
on community service projects.
 &HT;    You can't buy loyalty with just a paycheck. Building long-term
commitment depends on four things: the nature of the work itself,
the opportunity to grow, the chance to speak up and be listened to
and the feeling of making a difference.
 &HT;    Members of the new generation in the work force don't want to be
subordinates; they want to control their own fate. They want to do
meaningful work that has redeeming social value without sacrificing
the chance to get a life. Give them that and they'll give you
loyalty in return.

 &HT;    AUTHOR of ``THE BRAND YOU 50''
 &HT;    Loyalty is the glue that holds society together _ including
commercial society. That said, corporate loyalty is rubbish.
 &HT;    If you apply for a job at the Tom Peters Co. and imply that
you'd like to make a life of it, I'll unceremoniously throw you out
of the office. Suppose you are a would-be Michael Jordan of my
trade, consulting? I'll still toss ou out.
 &HT;    Here's my New Social Contract. I want my company to be so
attractive, so laden with talent, so energetic it makes your head
swim. I want to give you an exciting work environment, peerless
teammates and a string of challenging projects with top clients you
could not match anywhere else.
 &HT;    In turn, I demand that you give your all to these hot projects.
And I demand that you be loyal _ to your teammates, to the client,
to yourself. You must perform and grow as you've never performed
and grown before.
 &HT;    However, I also demand that you not be ``loyal'' to me or my
company. If you do turn out to be a Michael Jordan-type superstar,
don't I want you to stick around? No! (And yes.) That is, I do not
want you to stick around out of misguided allegiance. If I can
provide you with exciting new challenges, and if you respond
accordingly, well, then I hope we do indeed grow old together _ one
project at a time.
 &HT;    Mindless corporate loyalty _ the essence of '50s Babbittry _ was
always a rotten idea.

<P>
   Never mind the calendar. For Al Gore and George W. Bush, the
general election contest is under way. After earlier election night
surprises, bumps in the road, thousands of miles traveled and
millions of dollars spent, the presidential race is back to where
it began _ a fall campaign between Gore and Bush _ and both are
turning their full attention to each other.
</P>
<P>
   `BATTLE-TESTED' AND READY FOR WAR
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, after his Super Tuesday blowout over GOP
presidential rival John McCain, says he's ``battle-tested'' and
ready to take on Al Gore. Bush derided Gore as ``an agent of
Washington'' and partner in an administration that set the wrong
tone for America. Bush said he was strengthened by the fight with
McCain and would be ``reaching out to the people he energized.''
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY HEADING FOR THE BENCH
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's Democratic presidential rival has turned into a
supporter. After a coast-to-coast defeat in Super Tuesday contests,
Bill Bradley intends to drop his White House bid and endorse Gore
today. ``He won, I lost,'' Bradley said. The two waged a heated
battle that stretched for more than a year, and both men praised
one another in public comments after the results were in. Bradley's
staff says their man plans to stay active in public life, but would
not want the vice president job.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN ROCKET ABOUT TO FALL TO EARTH
</P>
<P>
   Aides to John McCain say they expect him to quit the race, but
that no firm decision has been made. A list of options being
presented to the candidate at his Arizona retreat reportedly
included staying in the race to further his political reform
agenda, getting out and supporting the Republican ticket, and
leaving to mount a third-party bid. McCain has said he would not
leave the GOP, and a senior McCain adviser told The Associated
Press he had no reason to believe the senator would do so.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS PUT ON JUDGMENT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says that in the marathon presidential race, the
biggest hurdle he sees is simply this: ``Convincing the American
people that I've got the right judgment to be the president.'' His
challenge, he said in an interview with The Associated Press, is
``convincing the American people that I'm a good, sound
decision-maker, that I'll make decisions of peace and prosperity
that will not only be well thought out, but lead to results.''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYING OUT THE REST OF THE SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   The next big primary day is Tuesday, when six states award 566
Democratic and 341 Republican delegates. Texas _ George W. Bush's
home _ will allocate 194 Democratic and 124 Republican delegates.
In Florida _ governed by Bush's brother, Jeb _ there are 161
Democratic and 80 Republican delegates. In Al Gore's home state of
Tennessee, 68 Democratic and 37 Republican delegates will be
awarded. There also will be voting in Mississippi, Louisiana and
Oklahoma. Before then, though, there will be various contests of
minor importance in South Carolina, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming,
Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN WRITES OFF GEORGIA; GEORGIA WRITES OFF MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   John McCain poured enough political firepower in South Carolina
last month to take down Fort Sumter, if not win the Republican
primary, but he chose to bypass neighboring Georgia altogether.
Perhaps he assumed his failure next door would cross state lines.
And it did. McCain has set foot in Georgia only once _ for a
two-hour book-signing event in Atlanta. That left the state open
for George W. Bush to get all 54 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ANGLING FOR A SHOT ON TICKET
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole once gently griped about George W. Bush's
bankroll, but then she bolstered his drive for the GOP and sealed
her place on his list of vice presidential prospects. With legwork
and thousands of campaign calls, Dole made it clear that she was
willing to work hard to help Bush achieve dominance over John
McCain. She also has been hinting that Bush could use a female
running mate to bridge the traditional gender gap that usually
helps Democrats in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   HOW NOT TO CONNECT WITH VOTERS
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley stood on the south side of East 77th Street, eager
to meet commuters at the entrance to the subway. But many New
Yorkers _ concerned, perhaps, by the crowd of police and media
around him, not to mention the spectacle of seven shirtless male
aides with B-R-A-D-L-E-Y painted on their chests _ simply crossed
the street Tuesday morning to use an alternate staircase.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO CONNECT WITH ONE VOTER
</P>
<P>
   Across Manhattan, Bill Bradley enjoyed a little more success
outside a polling place. Louis Gonzalez Jr., 57, was so excited
after shaking Bradley's hand that he changed his schedule and went
right in to vote at P.S. 9. When he came back out, he said to
Bradley: ``I just voted for you. I pulled the thing.'' Bradley lit
up and replied, ``Let me shake the hand that pulled the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   HEY, WE'VE GOT PROPOSITIONS FOR YOU
</P>
<P>
   Californians, voting on ballot questions, slammed the door on
gay marriage, gave prosecutors a mandate to lock up more teen-age
criminals, and reaffirmed their support for casino gambling on
Indian land. But Californians rejected an attempt to repeal the
tobacco taxes championed by movie director Rob Reiner, and defeated
a campaign finance reform proposal that would have allowed for
partial public financing of campaigns and banned corporate
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER WAY TO RAISE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who set a ``hard money'' record by raising more
than $70 million, quietly collected an additional $5.2 million in
two months through a new account that accepts both hard and ``soft
money'' contributions. An analysis of Federal Election Commission
records, according to the political funds Web site FECInfo, showed
the account, called the 1999 State Victory Fund Committee, has not
yet reported any spending. (Go to www.fecinfo.com)
</P>
<P>
   REBEL FLAG DISPUTE HITS BUSH AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says he's studying a request to take down a a
plaque bearing an image of the Confederate battle flag from the
Texas Supreme Court building. The NAACP and others want it removed,
saying it's offensive to minorities and doesn't belong in the
state's highest courts. ``I'm looking at that issue right now,''
Bush told a news conference. Earlier in the campaign, he refused to
say whether he thought the Confederate flag should be removed from
the South Carolina Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE SCANDAL
</P>
<P>
   Four in 10 Democratic voters said they disapprove of President
Clinton as a person, but the backlash for Al Gore was not as severe
as it had been in New Hampshire. Gore won a slim majority of those
who disapprove of Clinton as a person, but he took an overwhelming
majority of those who approve of Clinton personally, according to
exit polls conducted Tuesday for Voter News Service. Eight out of
10 Democrats approve of the job Clinton is doing, and
three-quarters of them voted for Gore. In New Hampshire, 54 percent
of Democratic voters disapproved of Clinton as a person, and 58
percent of them voted for Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   YOU COULD HEAR THE BLUES WAFTING
</P>
<P>
   The music captured the mood at Bill Bradley's campaign party
Tuesday night. As the first polls closed at 7 p.m., blues echoed
through a nearly empty room. The Harlem-based Real Deal Soul Band
had been told by campaign staff to be ready to break into ``Ain't
No Stopping Us Now'' if the night took a surprising turn for the
better. The cue never came. Some supporters were there with Mardi
Gras beads, determined to celebrate Fat Tuesday if not Super
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   WELL,THAT'S THE BIG CITY FOR YOU
</P>
<P>
   Karenna Gore Schiff, daughter of Al Gore, wandered into a New
York City twilight zone Tuesday night: She couldn't get a cab home
from her victory gig. Schiff thanked supporters on her father's
behalf at a Greenwich Village union hall, schmoozed with scores of
backers, and left the building with two Democratic aides shortly
before 11 p.m. The trio tried to hail a taxi in a drizzling rain,
but a steady wave of yellow passed them by. They had to hoof it;
four blocks before, with a little persuasion, managing to snag an
empty black limo.

PERKY PITCH WOMAN FOR NET COMPANY GOES WITH HER INNER GOOFBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've probably seen her _ especially if you watch late-night TV
_ hyping Internet America, an online service provider. She's the
energetic, girl-next-door blonde whose perkiness accompanies
fast-moving images, reminders that we live in a wired world that
just won't settle for being put on cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   We call her the Internet America Girl. She calls herself the
Geek Girl, a nod to Dallas-based Internet America's phone number:
1-800-BE-A-GEEK. But in real life, she's Natalie Austin,
26-year-old aspiring actress and self-professed geek _ although not
a geek in the way you may be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, if a half-hour phone chat is any indication,
aren't deceptive. Austin is gregarious and upbeat, laughing
frequently, often interrupting herself to refine her focus on the
points she's trying to make. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her approachability comes across onscreen _ so much that she has
an e-mail following, which has included at least one marriage
proposal. And it comes through in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I was in Dallas, I tried to go for a walk,''
says Austin, who is based in the Los Angeles area but flies to the
Metroplex several times a year to film the commercials. ``I tried
to go find Walgreens from my hotel room, and it was just completely
surreal. First of all, I got lost. I'm literally lost for two hours
in Dallas. ... and I'm probably the only person who could get lost
for two hours on foot _ people would just come up to me: `Oh,
you're the Geek Girl. Hi! How ya doin'?' They'd come introduce me
to their boyfriends, or to their mom or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin says she didn't know what she was getting into when she
showed up at an audition for the Internet America commercials. She
was just an actress looking for a job, and her biggest gig to date
was a Ford commercial in which she sang about Ford pickups with
Alan Jackson (the two never met; her voice was digitally mixed in
with the country superstar's). And the events leading to the
audition didn't give her much reason to be hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very bizarre day,'' says Austin, who has been doing
the spots for about two years. ``They had auditions in Dallas, I
guess, but they still wanted someone _ I don't know, more hyper or
something. So they came out here. I don't even know why I remember
this day, but there was a full moon, and (the producers) were late
to the audition because their plane was late and it was a good
thing, because someone had run into (my car) with their car. It was
just ridiculous; people are running into each other, everything's
running late, and so I was just completely like, `Hi, what's up,
how you doin', just got hit by car' _ just actin' like a dork, and
I guess that was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the audition _ like the first commercials _
stuck her behind a steering wheel. ``And it's just you, looking
like a big dork, with this steering wheel, talkin' to a camera,''
she says. But Austin's energy and personality got her the gig.
</P>
<P>
   Austin doesn't know where the energy comes from, but she's had
it since she was a little girl growing up in Russellville, Ark.,
near the Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a total tomboy,'' Austin says. ``I was always
making mud pies with the neighbors, just head-to-toe dirt. I was
always ready to fight; I was horrible, just horrible! I've always
been hyperactive, like my teachers have always had a problem with
me. Then came sports and cheerleading. So as corny as it is _ and I
know cheerleading is just hilarious _ but at least it gave me
something to do with all my energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin sang country and folk music growing up, which helped her
land the Ford commercial with Jackson. She wasn't so much a
country-music fan, though, until she moved to LA and started
missing home. And despite her increased visibility and her energy,
she remains fond of the simple life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really a typical 26-year-old in LA,'' Austin says.
``My friends out here call me `Geritol Woman.' I know that doesn't
sound like a hyperactive nickname. But because of all the partying,
y'know, there's a lot to do out here for young people out here. And
I'm just so not _ like, I was the designated driver on New Year's
Eve. I'm just like _ I'd much rather sit around and just blab, and
have a good talk with everybody and laugh our (tails) off than go
out and party. In that way, I'm a total geek out here 'cause I'd
much rather go hiking.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the Internet, Austin doesn't consider
herself much of a geek. She's more pitch-person than cyberwoman,
and that has made for some odd surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be just on the Internet, just writing e-mails or
something,'' Austin says. And ``I'll just get an instant message
from someone who has somehow figured out my e-mail. And I have no
idea how they've done it. And they'll be like, `Hey, what's up?'
You know, it's just `so and so from ... Texas, I see your
commercials, do you wanna blab?' And it's a little bit freaky!''
</P>
<P>
   Austin calls Charles Richardson, Internet America's director of
quality assurance, her Internet bodyguard because he protects her
from scarier messages and forwards more positive notes, along with
e-mails to Austin's agent. But so far, the commercials haven't led
to any higher-profile acting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They have led to on-air appearances at such radio outlets as
Dallas' KTCK/1310 AM ``The Ticket;'' Austin did a guest shot on the
morning-drive Dunham and Miller show. And Austin says she loves the
Metroplex, and the reactions she gets when she visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to lunch with Craig Miller and we had the best
conversation,'' she says. ``I just forgot how great it is to have a
conversation. You peel off less fake slices of onion. And out here
(in LA,) it's much more guarded, much more makeup, much more
everything to get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin, on the other hand, hardly seems guarded at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``On shooting day, it's hilarious, because I'm like, `OK, y'all,
if you want some energy, I'm going to be hyper,' '' she says. ``I'm
always dancing, and we'll play music in the background _ and it's
just good that that comes across. And it comes across so much that
people feel comfortable saying, `Talk to my daughter,' or `Write my
son a note,' or `Leave a message on my grandfather's machine.' It
just feels good _ like the feeling that I'm just, y'know, a big
goofball is coming through enough for people to feel it.''

 By DAVID BROOKS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Karl Marx spent all those years dreaming about the worker's
paradise. Yet he never got to sit in the conference room at Berbee
Information Networks Corp. and listen to Jim Berbee rattle off all
the luscious perks he offers his employees.
 &HT;    They get stock options, of course, but also Palm Pilots, cell
phones and a $1,000 bonus to help with the down payment on their
first homes. If they want to work in their pajamas, the company
pays to install and maintain high-speed ISDN lines in their
bedrooms.
 &HT;    Two years ago Berbee took everybody in the company and their
families to Disney World. Bagels and muffins are free on Fridays,
the sodas in the office machine are free all the time (consumption
went up 400 percent after that change), and if employees want to
use the office copiers for personal use, no problem.
 &HT;    An auto-repair service comes to the employee parking lot every
other Wednesday to do oil changes and tire rotations. There's
dry-cleaning delivery four days a week and pizza at least once a
month (which for some reason employees still have to pay for).
 &HT;    Marx would have looked at all the cushy benefits and figured
that the dictatorship of the proletariat had finally come to pass.
But there's a simpler explanation. Full employment.
 &HT;    Berbee is located in Madison, Wis., which has a microscopic 1.2
percent unemployment rate, second lowest in the country after
another university town, Columbia, Mo. Jim Berbee is desperate to
attract and retain workers. He has 220 employees and an amazing 94
percent retention rate, but his company is growing so fast he also
has 110 job openings. ``We're losing ground every week,'' he cries.
 &HT;    And it's not only the tech geeks who are in short supply. The
employment classifieds in the Madison paper land on porches each
Sunday with Richter-scale thuds.
 &HT;    One company offered free maid service for new employees.
No-skill, entry-level jobs carry wages of $8 or $9 an hour, blowing
away the federal minimum wage of $5.15. Burger chains are beginning
to offer health benefits to grill workers, and still some
franchises have closed for lack of staff.
 &HT;    Wisconsin Dells, a nearby resort area, has been forced to fly in
summer help from Lithuania, Zimbabwe, Russia and New Zealand.
Lands' End in nearby Dodgeville has given Green Bay Packers tickets
to employees who recruit friends.
 &HT;    Figi's, a mail-order company, offers free bus service and free
breakfast at Burger King. (Talk about killing off your work force.)
Carlson Company, which makes cosmetic counters, built a $750,000
day care center so staff members can visit their kids at story
time.
 &HT;    Hubert Humphrey used to go to bed dreaming of conditions like
this. But they're not celebrating in Madison.
 &HT;    I bounced around talking to businesspeople, politicians and
workers, and I kept trying to introduce the phrase ``full
employment'' into the conversation, because it sounds so happy and
satisfying. But they'd come back with the phrase ``labor
shortage,'' and then their brows would furrow with that expression
of grave concern people used to wear when talking about exploding
federal deficits.
 &HT;    ``Employers are have a very tough time finding workers,''
laments Madison's mayor, Susan J.M. Bauman. We sit in her office,
looking gravely concerned.
 &HT;    The other thing you notice is that the locals aren't behaving
like rational economic actors. With all these openings, workers
should be hopping from job to job, taking advantage of all the
perks and lures, boosting their income to the max.
 &HT;    Yet a survey done by the QTI Group, the largest local staffing
agency, found that the job-turnover rate has been dropping even as
the unemployment rate has plunged. QTI has 48 people in Madison
trying to find mostly lower-skill workers for clerical and
industrial jobs.
 &HT;    Every so often, the company offers $10 to anyone who comes in
and completes a job application. In Madison, in other words,
they're paying people just to look for work.
 &HT;    But no one's jumping at the opportunities. Nor are wages
skyrocketing. Salaries are rising, especially among low-end workers
and up top among the techies. But salaries are rising nowhere near
as fast as you'd expect in such tight labor conditions.
 &HT;    You get the impression that even in flush times most people are
still pretty conservative when it comes to work and job hunting.
 &HT;    I keep hearing the same things. People don't like to jump
around. People like to work at places that are familiar, or where
some member of their family already works. Nepotism reigns.
 &HT;    Melster Candies Inc., the country's leading manufacturer of
circus peanuts _ those orange puffy things made from sugar _ solved
their staffing problems when they sent job applications home with
some of their workers, asking if they had any underemployed
relatives. Berbee boasts that he has had daughters recruit fathers
and husbands recruit wives.
 &HT;    This isn't the free-agent nation that our futurologists are
always predicting. This isn't the land of rampant, loyalty-is-dead
individualists. There's a little more caution and communitarianism
in the air here.
 &HT;    One is reminded that Wisconsin is said to outstrip most of the
rest of the nation in Tupperware use per capita. This is the kind
of state where people save their leftovers. And that basic sense of
ballast colors the local reaction to prosperity. There aren't many
people riding around in Lexus or Mercedes SUV's.
 &HT;    The job center in Madison, which coordinates state and county
jobless, housing and other benefits, is just in the shadow, and
definitely within the aroma range, of the Oscar Mayer
meat-processing plant.
 &HT;    Inside, it looks like a high school library, with rows and rows
of computers, where people can page through the online job
listings. I plugged in my profile and came back with 442 executive
openings, 403 clerical openings, 292 sales openings and so on,
including some career options I'd never really considered, like
boar-semen collector, TV weatherman and wooden-pole inspector.
 &HT;    The people at the keyboards around me were diverse, a couple of
young Asian and Hispanic men (there has been an influx over the
past two years as word of the hot job market has spread), a
middle-aged white guy in a hunting hat, a few seniors and
miscellaneous young people.
 &HT;    There was some sarcastic chatter among terminals: ``Work on
Saturdays? Are you kidding me?''
 &HT;    Mary Witt, the director of Dane County Job Service, says that
most of the people already have jobs, but would like to find some
place where they can advance. A basic problem for employed and
unemployed alike is that people are too cautious when looking for
work.
 &HT;    ``Most people select the line of work they've done before,''
Mary Witt says. ``People think small.''
 &HT;    In contrast to greater Madison's relentless optimism, the mood
in the employment office is sober, if not gloomy. And why not? This
is about the only place anyone hears any bad economic news.
 &HT;    ``I can get anyone a job,'' says Tom Swoboda, a counselor, ``but
will it pay the bills?''
 &HT;    Madison's real estate prices have risen with the economy, so
about a third of the people in the homeless shelters have full-time
or more than full-time work. The saddest cases, the counselors tell
me, involve extraordinarily well-educated people - men and women
with Ph.D.'s and law degrees _ who have propelled themselves into
an elite stratum where job competition is still fierce.
 &HT;    Job experts are urging employers to begin looking for workers
among formerly marginalized groups, like criminals and liberal arts
majors, but apparently it hasn't helped these folks.
 &HT;    I've driven a few miles from the job center, and it is as if I
am standing at the source of the Nile. I am here at the midway
point of the assembly line for the Sub-Zero Freezer Company. From
this very spot, high-end refrigerators flow out to overendowed
kitchens around the globe _ to Santa Monica, Fifth Avenue,
Bethesda, Boca, Winnetka and across the whole fertile crescent of
upscale squash-court-size kitchentopia.
 &HT;    It is humbling to be here, at the source, knowing that the
shelves being installed in front of me will one day hold organic
chutneys, frozen free-range prawns, Florentine pestos and all the
other delicacies so pleasing to the nation's bull-market gourmets.
 &HT;    If there is any place in Madison where people have a right to
feel puffed up by their economic success, it is here at Sub-Zero,
the makers of the quintessential chichi '90s product. Yet I'm not
sure I've ever been in a more unpretentious and tradition-conscious
corporate culture.
 &HT;    I've just had a meeting with three executives, genial
conservative white men in their 50s in blue or gray suits, white
shirts and muted ties. These guys are proud to be making a
top-of-the-line product, but it could be top-of-the-line turbines
or diesels, to judge by their complete lack of fabulousness.
 &HT;    Sub-Zero tried to use robotics to put together its machines. But
the robots made too many mistakes. So they went back to making the
machines by hand. The workers look like classic assembly-line
labor, former high school football stars now wearing Packers shirts
over slightly bulging waistlines. They have old-fashioned
Harley-Davidson tattoos, not newfangled Nirvana-inspired tattoos,
and high school degrees or an equivalent.
 &HT;    Sub-Zero, though it is growing quickly, doesn't have much
trouble finding workers. Fathers bring in sons and daughters; some
are third-generation Sub-Zero families. Once in place, workers tend
to stay. And newcomers are drawn by the company's reputation at the
rate of about 10 to 15 applications a week.
 &HT;    That's the final striking feature of the Madison job market. If
the average worker were strictly Homo economicus, he'd choose an
employer on the basis of salary and benefits, and jump when he's
offered something better.
 &HT;    But time and again, people mention the importance of reputation.
They want to be able to give a satisfying answer to the
cocktail-party question ``Where do you work?''
 &HT;    Status companies seem to have a big advantage finding workers,
and that is true in the manufacturing sector as well as among the
biotech and high-tech start-ups.
 &HT;    In the heart of downtown Madison there is a tech company that
has a corporate culture several galaxies removed from Sub-Zero.
Sonic Foundry is a software firm that makes it possible to convert
audio and video for the Web. It is located in a string of renovated
warehouses.
 &HT;    There's an iron rule of office design. The more beaten and
industrial the look, the more likely the firm is a high-tech
start-up looking for a patina of gritty industrial authenticity. If
the headquarters are clean, quiet and sedate, with tranquil carpets
and serene watercolors, then you know the company is in
manufacturing.
 &HT;    Sonic Foundry, with its factorylike office design, is at the
cutting edge of the information age.
 &HT;    I should confess straight out that I'm probably not cool enough
to even write about Sonic Foundry. There are 20-somethings with
bleached-blond surfer haircuts, pierced noses, Smash Mouth goatees,
baggy pants and office nameplates with tags like Dirtforker on
them. The hipness rolls off them in waves.
 &HT;    ``Our business is one of the sexiest industries you can be in,''
says Rimas Buinevicius, the company's CEO, lounging back in his
black turtleneck on the couch next to a retro steel coffee table.
``It's the nexus of new media and music.''
 &HT;    The hiring process sounds like the velvet-rope scrutiny you
might get at a downtown club. Each potential employee is
interviewed seven or eight times, to make sure the person is
``going to fit in culturally,'' Buinevicius says.
 &HT;    Sonic Foundry has a growth rate of about 100 percent a year. But
once you're in, there's no cooler place to be. There are about 60
computer engineers on staff, and over the past five years only one
has left. So there's even stability among the stock-option rebels
at Sonic Foundry.
 &HT;    In fact, the affluence feels a lot more stable here than in the
Silicon Valleys or Alleys or the rest of the Fast Company
corridors.
 &HT;    Economists have been puzzling about how the recovery has been
able to surge for so long without inflation. Many have been
wondering when the nation is going to have to pay for all the
gilded-age excess.
 &HT;    But maybe Wisconsin is more typical of America than Palo Alto or
SoHo or any of the other Next New Thing zones.
 &HT;    Maybe even where the economy is hot, most Americans have
remained cautious, conservative and cool.

 THE PRICE of `FREEDOM'  
 &HT;     (This article has already moved to Centerpiece clients. To
publish as a ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased _ the

Syndicate sales representatives:

 &HT;    (--Latin America: ANA PENA in New York, 310-996-0075; fax, By NINA MUNK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's early winter. Cold. We've ordered in breaded-chicken
sandwiches, Ari Horowitz and I, and are sitting in his cheerless
office in Midtown Manhattan.
 &HT;    ``This whole concept of having to be in the office from 9 to 5,
or whatever it is, that's gone, that's just not the world,'' muses
Horowitz, founder of FreeAgent.com, a Web site for independent
contractors, freelancers, part-timers and moonlighters. ``There's
no corporate loyalty or any of that stuff anymore.''
 &HT;    Above Horowitz's desk is a badly framed reproduction of a
Jackson Pollock. Near the door, tacked to the wall, is a blown-up
cover of Snowboard Life magazine that Horowitz rescued from
someone's trash. (``Learn to Snowboard the Easy Way!'')
 &HT;    Not that Horowitz, 31, has much time for snowboarding or art
collecting. Himself, he's not a free agent.
 &HT;    ``I'm an entrepreneur, so I've got to come here every day. I
can't disappear. I can't even take vacations. The free agent has a
much better lifestyle. They're not necessarily going to make as
much money as I might, but they can go snowboarding; they can
decide when they want to work and when they don't want to work.
It's an incredible lifestyle. I can't really think of a better way
to spend your life.''
 &HT;    Along with Horowitz, a small but vocal group of academics,
evangelists and entrepreneurs are promoting this way of life.
They're convinced we're on the cusp of a free-agent revolution.
From their point of view, big centralized companies with thousands
of permanent employees are relics.
 &HT;    Back in the days of manual typewriters, before the electronic
age, megacompanies made sense. How else could a team of engineers,
designers and marketers work together? But in the digital age, the
reasoning goes, megacorporations will be displaced by something
called virtual corporations _ teams of ``free agents'' who work
together for the duration of a project, and no longer.
 &HT;    Horowitz compares the virtual corporation to a movie set: ``In
Hollywood, when you produce a movie, it's not about a corporation,
it's about all these individuals who have complementary skill sets:
They come together, they work on a team, they produce something and
they disperse,'' he explains. ``This is what I envision the future
of work being.''
 &HT;    According to the gospel, free agency isn't just a business
model. It's a workers'-liberation movement, promising emancipation
from the shackles of corporate America.
 &HT;    Perhaps you've heard this radio ad for FreeAgent.com, whose
slogan is ``For a Brave New Work Force'': ``If people often call
you the hired gun, you just may be a free agent. If people call you
'that guy on 15 who's been here forever,' you are not a free agent.
If you've ever sent an urgent e-mail pitching yourself for a primo
project half a world away, you're a free agent. If you've ever sent
an urgent e-mail asking, 'Who left the burrito in the office
microwave?' you are not a free agent.''
 &HT;    Fussing over burritos left in the microwave is hopelessly
conventional. As are dental plans, expense accounts, life
insurance, 401(k) plans and sick leave.
 &HT;    Today's heroes take risks _ they're entrepreneurs and IPO
millionaires, and if you haven't achieved that status, becoming a
free agent may be the next best thing. The term free agent conjures
the seven-figure salaries of professional ballplayers. It also
hints at self-reliance. Free agents, like mercenary soldiers, can
join one army after another. They don't need the company, they
claim; the company needs them.
 &HT;    ``Be your own boss!'' exhorts an advertisement for Guru.com,
another Web site for free agents. ``Work where you want, when you
want. No supervisors. No commuting hassles. Earn $$$ thousands.
Freedom to balance your priorities and work in your pajamas.''
 &HT;    The cult of the free agent took off in January 1998, when Fast
Company, organ of new-age management, heralded on its cover, ``Free
Agent Nation.''
 &HT;    As if reporting the demise of corporate America (with its
layoffs, office politics, demotions, harassment, hierarchies and
general incompetence), the cover lines continued: ``25 Million
Americans Declare Independence. Are You Ready to Join Them?'' It
was the Boston Tea Party all over again.
 &HT;    The author of that story, Daniel Pink, a former speechwriter for
Al Gore, has since become a one-man advocacy group for free agency,
quoted as an authority in publications like Newsweek and The Wall
Street Journal.
 &HT;    A contributing editor at Fast Company, Pink is currently writing
a book about free agents. He also operates a Web site called
FreeAgentNation.com, and he gives (paid) speeches promoting free
agency. In exchange for stock options, he serves on the advisory
board of FreeAgent.com's parent company, Opus360, and writes an
advice column for Guru.com.
 &HT;    Pink claims he's enriching the lives of workers (many of whom do
not have stock options). ``I happen to think it's a human way to
work so I advocate it for people,'' he tells me.
 &HT;    Pink's greatest contribution to free agency involves statistics.
When he wrote the Fast Company article, he counted 25 million free
agents in America; now he says there are 33 million.
 &HT;    Just how did Pink arrive at those huge numbers? He won't let on.
 &HT;    But definitive or not, by this time Pink's hopeful and
opportunistic numbers have been repeated so often they've become a
cliche, repeated in stock-offering prospectuses, publicity material
and other channels of hype.
 &HT;    ``Between you and me,'' a founder of a temp agency said, ``Dan
had no clue. But his numbers became gospel and, hey, it worked. Now
everyone bases the market on those numbers.''
 &HT;    Promoting their business models with Pink's buoyant stats,
dozens of companies targeting free agents have been popping up.
Among them: icPlanet.com, Ants.com, IMCOR.com, eLance.com,
MBAFreeAgents.com, iNiku.com and Aquent.com.
 &HT;    Like FreeAgent.com, these Web sites match employers with
employees, listing short-term and part-time jobs and encouraging
``free agents'' to post resumes online. They also offer advice and
give pep talks promoting free agency to those who cling to their
401(k)'s as if to life rafts. (``Sure working for yourself is
scary,'' warns Aquent's Web site. ``Life is an adventure and then
you die. Live now!'')
 &HT;    MBAFreeAgents' focus is business-school graduates; Aquent's is
technology; IMCOR's is ``portable executives,'' including chief
executive officers, chief financial officers and chief technology
officers.
 &HT;    Other copanies riding the free-agent wave include the Ebays of
human capital: online talent auctions like Bid4Geeks.com and Talent
Market, part of Monster.com, where free agents offer their services
to the highest bidder.
 &HT;    Recently, a free-lance pastry chef in Astoria, Queens, with a
talent for making croissants and brioches, put himself up for sale
on Talent Market. (He had attracted no bidders when I last
checked.)
 &HT;    At Ants.com and icPlanet.com, free agents compete in a process
known as a reverse auction, in which an employer offers a job and
entertains bids. One posting at Ants.com, for example, urges
multilingual free agents to bid on this job: translating a mammoth
high-tech manual from French into Turkish and English. As of late
February, 12 translators had placed bids ranging from $50,000 to
$750,000.
 &HT;    Whether they specialize in technology or Turkish, dot-coms
dedicated to free agents have yet to prove they can make money.
According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, FreeAgent.com, for example, lost $30 million last year
on revenues of just $400,000.
 &HT;    Access to the site's basic services is free to anyone who
registers with FreeAgent.com; at last count (Feb. 9), roughly
64,000 people had done so.
 &HT;    But in order for FreeAgent.com to be profitable, it must get its
registered users to upgrade to membership status, which costs $199
upfront, plus $119 to $274 a month (higher rates offer more
benefits). Members _ there were only 286 as of Feb. 9 _ get to buy
group-rate insurance, join a retirement plan and have their
paperwork looked after (invoices, bills, taxes and so on). Each
member also receives between 250 and 500 stock options in
FreeAgent.com's parent company, which is about to go public.
 &HT;    In addition to fees from members, FreeAgent.com intends to
charge companies for posting jobs. It also plans to sell banner ads
and earn commissions on products sold through FreeAgent.com. An
optimist, Horowitz anticipates that throngs of free agents, lured
by ``the perfect lifestyle,'' will eventually be drawn to his Web
site.
 &HT;    For all the hype, there's nothing glamorous about most of the
jobs posted on the free-agent Web sites. On FreeAgent.com,
someone's looking for a bookkeeper to work 4 hours a week, there's
a 15-hour-a-week job editing marketing material, an opening for a
receptionist (``able to professionally answer 4-plus incoming
lines!'') and so on through the range of skills.
 &HT;    I contacted a few dozen people whose resumes were posted on
FreeAgent.com. Almost everyone admitted this much: If the right
full-time, permanent job came along, they'd embrace it, eagerly.
 &HT;    Last year Ralph Armenta lost his job as a managing director of a
big hedge fund. When I spoke to him in January, he identified
himself as ``an involuntary free agent,'' working from his home in
New Jersey on short-term assignments.
 &HT;    ``I'm 40 years old,'' he explained. ``I have a couple of kids,
age 6 and 2. I'd like stability. Maybe if I were 5 or 10 years
younger and had less responsibility, I would take a run at it. But
I want to be back in the work force.'' He doesn't want to earn $$$
thousands in his pajamas; like most people, he'd like a regular
paycheck.
 &HT;    The profile that Paulette M. Glassman posted on FreeAgent.com
highlights her 10 years of experience producing advertisements and
films. But like Armenta, Glassman is not a free agent by choice.
She is forced to make do with part-time work.
 &HT;    ``I keep hearing about how good the job situation is, but for
me, for people who are grown women _ I'd rather not give my age,
but I'm not 21 _ it's been tough to find work. I'm struggling to
stay solvent.''
 &HT;    Most of the responses Glassman gets to her posting on
FreeAgent.com and other job-recruitment Web sites are unwelcome:
offers from multilevel marketing outfits, many of which appear to
be Ponzi schemes. Sometimes, when the phone does ring in her
cramped studio apartment, it's a debt-collection agency calling.
 &HT;    More than 60 percent of free agents earn less than regular
full-time workers in comparable jobs, according to a study by the
Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning Washington research
group. They have no benefits, they don't get stock options or paid
vacations, and free agents may not be protected by employment laws.
 &HT;    ``It's certainly true that there's a growth in the number of
workers who are contract workers,'' remarks Stephen Barley,
co-director of the Center for Work Technology and Organization at
Stanford University.
 &HT;    Barley spent two years studying free agents in Silicon Valley.
(The results of that study will be published later this year.) ``To
call them free agents, however, is, well, interesting. The vast
majority of them work through a staffing firm.''
 &HT;    Which is to say that the vast majority of them are temps.
Outside Hollywood and Silicon Valley, the ``virtual corporation''
is virtually unknown.
 &HT;    For people whose skills are in high demand _ Java programmers,
corporate turnaround experts, Internet consultants _ being a free
agent may have the potential to be liberating.
 &HT;    Last summer, Samantha Saturn (her real name) quit her job as
director of marketing for CDNow, an online music store, in order to
do her very own thing. She called her firm Saturn Network, whose
promising slogan is ``Expert Marketing Solutions for Digital
Brands.''
 &HT;    So far, working out of a one-bedroom apartment in Greenwich
Village, Saturn, 28, has had four short-term assignments. Her
latest: a five-month marketing project for PlanetOut, a
gay-and-lesbian Web site that's getting ready for an initial public
offering.
 &HT;    Saturn sets her own hours. She telecommutes. She doesn't have to
play office politics anymore. Sometime she works from Les Deux
Gamins, an of-the-moment cafe right around the corner from her
apartment. Installing herself at a corner table with her IBM
laptop, cell phone and a pot of coffee, as if Les Deux Gamins were
her office, Saturn holds meetings, she brainstorms, she writes long
memos.
 &HT;    ``It makes me feel like I'm in Paris,'' she says. Like Hemingway
at Les Deux Magots.
 &HT;    But New York in the 2000s is a lot more expensive than Paris in
the 1920s. Being a free agent is costly.
 &HT;    There are bills to pay: office supplies, long-distance phone
calls, Internet service, photocopying, FedEx deliveries, travel,
business lunches, lawyers and accountants. There's health insurance
and Social Security and Medicare taxes, which, at 15.3 percent of
income, is double what old-fashioned permanent employees pay.
 &HT;    To balance the burden, Saturn has been given a bit of equity
from some of the dot-coms she has counseled. ``I'm getting little
pieces of a lot of companies at a very critical time,'' she
explains sotto voce. ``There's no way I could do this unless I were
a venture capitalist.''
 &HT;    About her past life as an ordinary full-time employee, she
remembers that she ``was a slave to my job, a total workaholic.''
Is she following the 12 steps? Not exactly. ``Actually,'' she
confesses, ``I work more now.''
 &HT;    Who has the most to gain from the free-agent revolution?
Certainly those who advocate it.
 &HT;    Horowitz must surely be grateful that he is not a free agent but
an Internet entrepreneur instead. He'll probably be worth about $35
million, on paper, when Opus360, FreeAgent.com's parent company,
completes its coming initial public offering.
 &HT;    As for Pink, unofficial census taker of the free-agent nation,
he'll soon be able to cash in his options in FreeAgent.com. And
when his book is published early next year, he'll no doubt take his
free-agent publicity machine on the road.
 &HT;    The other big winners are companies in the market for what
economists call a ``flexible work force,'' which is to say, workers
who can be hired and fired overnight, in the blink of an eye.
Workers who answer 4-plus incoming lines and to whom you have no
obligation whatsoever. Workers who are here today, gone tomorrow.
 &HT;    FreeAgent.com knows the score. Its Web site includes a page that
encourages employers to hire its eager temps. ``Top 10 Reasons Why
Managers Love Free Agents'' is how it begins.
 &HT;    And then FreeAgent.com shows its hand:
 &HT;    10. They don't need pep talks.
 &HT;    9. They don't gripe about their salary.
 &HT;    8. They won't stab you in the back.
 &HT;    7. They tell you when your ideas (expletive).
 &HT;    6. When they're sick, they work from home.
 &HT;    5. They don't ask for health insurance, paid vacations, personal
days ...
 &HT;    4. ... 401(k) plans, stock options, quarterly bonuses. ...
 &HT;    3. no performance reviews.
 &HT;    2. If they're stupid, lazy or incompetent, you can fire them
pretty easily.
 &HT;    1. They do all the work, you take all the credit.

<P>
   After nearly a decade of planning, the Women of the West Museum
has finally opened. At least virtually.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's backers could not get enough financing for a
``real'' space, so they opened an online museum. They are holding
their first exhibition, the LoDo Mural Project, which combines a
public mural project in downtown Denver with corresponding online
images and text.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally the museum was going to be a bricks-and-mortar
stand-alone facility,'' said Marsha Semmel, president and chief
executive of the Women of the West Museum, based in Boulder, Colo.
``What we are doing is what many businesses are doing _ adapting to
the changing ways people spend their time and get their
information. We can serve a much larger audience if we take
advantage of online opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The current exhibition can be seen on the streets of Denver
along a temporary construction walkway. Two local artists, Tony
Ortega and Sylvia Montero, created colorful paintings of women, who
have contributed to Colorado history. Above the 250-foot mural is
the museum's Web address, www.wowmuseum.org, which invites
passers-by to visit and learn more about the paintings and the
women portrayed in them.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can learn about pioneer and contemporary
women who helped shape the West, like Molly Brown (the unsinkable
Titanic passenger) and Teresita Sandoval, one of the founders of
Pueblo, Colo., in the 1800's.
</P>
<P>
   Other features of the site include a virtual story quilt and a
neighborhood walking tour organized by Denver grade-school pupils.
</P>
<P>
   Each patch of the quilt represents a different person or story,
like ``1940s High Country Bride,'' an excerpt from a diary by Janet
Roberts, who moved from Massachusetts to the mining town of Climax,
Colo., with her husband of five weeks: ``For us, the next seven
years would be filled with exploration of new frontiers of science,
and new frontiers in our own lives, getting to know the beauty of
the mountain wilderness just outside the camp, learning to ski from
our own front door, and making new and fascinating friends whose
lives were so different from that with which we were familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the focus of the museum is on women and their
experiences west of the Mississippi, Semmel does not believe that
will limit its reach. ``When our site was named a Yahoo
pick-of-the-week, we heard about it from a male engineering student
in Shanghai who e-mailed us,'' she said. ``I think that's very
symbolic. It shows there is this interest in the American West that
exists way beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Semmel said the goal was to someday have a
permanent space. For now, the museum is preparing for its next
exhibit _ a traveling show that will be hosted by libraries,
shopping malls and schools.

<P>
   By their media shall ye know them.
</P>
<P>
   That has always been my test for whole societies.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind whether they call themselves Democracy or Republic:
free press means free country; controlled press, miserable tyranny.
The same goes for individuals. My media test also works for sorting
out people, especially office workers. Never mind the title on the
door or the workplace habitat, media power is what denotes true
rank, clout and worth.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Washington that I first realized that medium is not
just message but also identity. Obviously, not every civil servant
of rank could command a corner window or private toilet. So the
telltale sign of superiority became a pen _ a government-issue
tapered pen that stood erect in a holder originally designed for
quills.
</P>
<P>
   A mere stenographer might also accidentally qualify for a window
or coat closet instead of rack. But only a boss had one of those
pens beside the blotter and water pitcher. Federal regulations
required that token of status, no less rigorous than the Pentagon's
dress code.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, I have come to expect workers' media of
communication to define their hierarchical worth. After elegant
desk sets became commonplace, corporate and government strivers
acquired intercoms to summon subordinates. Next appeared dictation
machines, and then portable recorders whose content could be tossed
to underlings for typing and brought back for signing with those
executive pens.
</P>
<P>
   Later down the chain of command came multibuttoned telephones
with one-touch connection to different layers of the bureaucracy.
And later still managers got silent buzzers to alert a secretary to
overhear and transcribe a conversation. Eventually, inspired by the
White House, the highest ranks achieved voice-activated recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, these functional media spread to hoi polloi, forcing
the invention of supplementary definitions by decor _ notably rugs
on the floor, art on the walls and keys to private toilets,
elevators and dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But ranking by media remains the most reliable status index.
Indeed, it seems to be surviving even the centrifugal force of the
Modem Rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-modem world, the passkey to privilege is the PC
password. In communal offices, whosoever is enabled by secret code
to read into another's files _ without being read in return _ is
well on the way to sizable bonuses and stock options.
</P>
<P>
   And even the least powerful password leads to a corporate
support system of benefits, counselors and technological expertise.
Walls, windows, carpets, paintings _ all the old physical
attributes of rank and power have been supplanted by a virtual, and
portable, medium.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional passwords unlock undeniable privilege. Few
individuals cruising alone on the Web can long compete.
</P>
<P>
   There are young techies who persist in believing that the
Information Revolution is destroying all hierarchy and rapidly
democratizing the means of creation and expression. They sound much
like the last century's revolutionaries who thought they could
democratize (i.e. communize) the means of production.
</P>
<P>
   Wired magazine, the liberationists' bible, would have us believe
that every wired person on the planet will soon have an equal voice
in things _ except, of course, that Wired itself is empowered by
the lush advertising of corporate behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   The modem explosion has indeed produced a great dispersion of
the work force. And many of America's more than 20 million new
home-office laborers proudly proclaim themselves ``independent''
contractors, ``free agents'' and ``self-owned'' businesses. Many
delight in their flexible work schedules, with time for the kids
and for errands, and their escape from supervision.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that a great many of today's independents,
temps and self-employed are the downsized of yesterday, cast adrift
without community, benefits or unemployment insurance. Never mind
what they call themselves; by their media shall ye know them.
</P>
<P>
   Look past the deceptively egalitarian cell phones, faxes and PC
keyboards. Truly secure, insured and tax-code favored Americans are
wired into networks and propelled by corporate engines. And their
speech is amplified by a collective. They get group health and
pension plans that are subsidized by taxpayers as well as
employers, plus numerous workplace amenities, sometimes even
including child care.
</P>
<P>
   Equally well served are some ``outsourced'' workers who may
labor at home or on the road but are authorized by higher authority
to use SecurID cards and passwords to scale institutional fire
walls and tap into networks of privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of home workers who cruise alone in the Internet
without these corporate keys or community are discovering that
their vaunted autonomy comes with a large dose of ignominy. They
labor in fear of illness or recession, or both, and they lack
protection against discrimination, most notably in taxation.
</P>
<P>
   They must pay an employer's share of Social Security as well as
their own. They do not qualify for group insurance or benefits.
They must fight the government to deduct office expenses. Only a
few professionals among them enjoy the power to bargain
collectively.
</P>
<P>
   Show me a worker who hacks at home without a corporate password
and I'll show you an underprivileged citizen. To be sure, communal
office workers _ is there no better term for the old
``office''-office? _ are bound to routines and schedules that
interfere with domestic bliss and duties. And they are intensely
scrutinized, most gallingly by WatchDog, a software that lets the
boss track your every movement on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But the home-office worker must watch the dog _ and greet the
repairman, pay bills, chase accountants and lawyers and cry out
constantly for technical help. That's multitasking with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, most unincorporated individualists will be
corralled into unions that bargain for benefits and provide shared
services. The MacArthur genius finders have already embraced the
farsighted Sara Horwitz, the founder and leader of Working Today, a
nonprofit lobby for nearly 100,000 free-agent members.
</P>
<P>
   Effective representation, of course, will require taxation and
incorporation, then elections, politics and varied ranges of
influence _ in other words, hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The reward will be benefits collectively achieved and
individually coded, duly accessed by some password, the key to
social worth, your place in the crowd.

<P>
   Today more than ever, American workers check their freedoms at
the office door. Employers have taken to monitoring employees'
workplace behavior right down to a single computer keystroke or
bathroom break, even probing into their personal concerns and
leisure activities. In the area of privacy rights, workers have
actually lost ground in recent years _ from purse searches to
genetic testing to the chemical and electronic forms of snooping
adopted by many companies in the '90s.

   &UR; THE CHANGING OFFICE: FROM FEUDALISM to FAMILY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES McGRATH &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, offices operated on the feudal system. There
was the boss, or liege lord, who occasionally dispensed favors _
raises, that is _ but more often withheld them. For his gaze to
fall upon you was supposed to be reward enough. There were the
knights, and beneath them the courtiers _ the toadies and
rumormongers and ladies-in-waiting. Everyone knew his or her place.
But the office is now a family, a home away from home, where
communication is almost constant and meanness and hurtfulness are
frowned upon.

   &UR; ZERO PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID BROOKS &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has a job in Madison, Wisc. Some companies even pay
money to those who come in and fill out job applications. So it
follows that workers should be hopping from job to job, taking
advantage of this ``employee's market,'' demanding more perks and
lures, boosting their income to the max. But people aren't behaving
that way. The job-turnover rate has been dropping even as the
unemployment rate has plunged.

   Today more than ever, American workers check their freedoms at
the office door. Employers have taken to monitoring employees'
workplace behavior right down to a single computer keystroke or
bathroom break, even probing into their personal concerns and
leisure activities. In the area of privacy rights, workers have
actually lost ground in recent years _ from purse searches to
genetic testing to the chemical and electronic forms of snooping
adopted by many companies in the '90s.

   &UR; THE CHANGING OFFICE: FROM FEUDALISM to FAMILY &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In the old days, offices operated on the feudal system. There
was the boss, or liege lord, who occasionally dispensed favors _
raises, that is _ but more often withheld them. For his gaze to
fall upon you was supposed to be reward enough. There were the
knights, and beneath them the courtiers _ the toadies and
rumormongers and ladies-in-waiting. Everyone knew his or her place.
But the office is now a family, a home away from home, where
communication is almost constant and meanness and hurtfulness are
frowned upon.

`WE DESERVE' bETTER, DONALD

   ``Trump: The America We Deserve'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Donald Trump with Dave Shiflett &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Political essays &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance Books, $24.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If one is compelled to consider billionaire developer Donald
Trump, the Yiddish word ``chutzpah'' leaps to mind. Meaning
shameless audacity, ``chutzpah'' fits Trump like a Hugo Boss suit,
summing up the Promethean ego that has motivated him to plaster his
name on Manhattan skyscrapers and up and down Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Having emerged from the brink of bankruptcy, Trump has found a
renewed sense of Caligulan self-worth, giving him the hubris to
right all the country's political wrongs. Perhaps predictably for
someone so estranged from humility, Trump has published his formula
for a better nation in ``The America We Deserve.'' We might
``deserve'' some of what Trump has to say, but few merit hearing it
from him.
</P>
<P>
   In this postmodern political world where former pro wrestlers
become governors, ``The America We Deserve'' is part of Trump's
bizarrely coquettish bid for the presidency. (On Feb. 13, Trump
announced he was giving up his campaign in light of Reform Party
turmoil. But it's not unheard of for departing Reform Party
candidates to reconsider their campaign farewells; recall Ross
Perot in 1992.) But medication more deleterious than the ailment
comes to mind when reading Trump's prescription. Whenever ``The
Donald'' stumbles upon a nugget of insight, his browbeating
delivery obliterates the point well taken. And it's certainly not
advisable for a political neophyte like Trump to come across as a
smug know-it-all. Unfortunately, Trump can't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   Through 11 chapters and an epilogue, ``The America We Deserve''
gambols across the political landscape, making shrink-wrapped
assessments of business, education, foreign policy, health care and
something called ``The American Way.'' It's a political issue cheat
sheet one might pocket before heading out to a local bar. There,
Trumpisms can be tossed off like so many beer nuts. To wit: New
York is ``the hottest city on the planet''; politics is a
``special-interest cesspool''; Pat Buchanan has ``totally lost
it''; and Bill Bradley is ``a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump's ``buck-stops-here'' solutions, often buttressed by
informative statistics, might ring truer were they not delivered in
such a patronizing tone. To be sure, Trump serves up some real
whoppers among the occasional sound judgments. For North Korea,
Trump advocates an aggressive disarmament. Great, but how?
Dilapidated schools, he opines, could be completely refurbished by
diverting the $50 billion spent on armed forces in Europe. So much
for NATO. As for crime, Trump would gladly carry out the death
penalty in public.
</P>
<P>
   Although inspired by Minnesota's new governor, Jesse Ventura,
Trump's views skew less toward the Reform Party and more toward the
Grand Old Party. His Republican loyalty shines through ad nauseam
praise of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and a severe case of
Ronald Reagan hero-worship.
</P>
<P>
   Trump musters great passion about the need to eradicate
inner-city crime and improve education. Unfortunately, these
moments of lucidity get lost in the braggadocio that has kept Trump
in the boardroom, and, so far, out of the White House.

<P>
   If one is compelled to consider billionaire developer Donald
Trump, the Yiddish word ``chutzpah'' leaps to mind. Meaning
shameless audacity, ``chutzpah'' fits Trump like a Hugo Boss suit,
summing up the Promethean ego that has motivated him to plaster his
name on Manhattan skyscrapers and up and down Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Having emerged from the brink of bankruptcy, Trump has found a
renewed sense of Caligulan self-worth, giving him the hubris to
right all the country's political wrongs. Perhaps predictably for
someone so estranged from humility, Trump has published his formula
for a better nation in ``The America We Deserve.'' We might
``deserve'' some of what Trump has to say, but few merit hearing it
from him.
</P>
<P>
   In this postmodern political world where former pro wrestlers
become governors, ``The America We Deserve'' is part of Trump's
bizarrely coquettish bid for the presidency. (On Feb. 13, Trump
announced he was giving up his campaign in light of Reform Party
turmoil. But it's not unheard of for departing Reform Party
candidates to reconsider their campaign farewells; recall Ross
Perot in 1992.) But medication more deleterious than the ailment
comes to mind when reading Trump's prescription. Whenever ``The
Donald'' stumbles upon a nugget of insight, his browbeating
delivery obliterates the point well taken. And it's certainly not
advisable for a political neophyte like Trump to come across as a
smug know-it-all. Unfortunately, Trump can't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   Through 11 chapters and an epilogue, ``The America We Deserve''
gambols across the political landscape, making shrink-wrapped
assessments of business, education, foreign policy, health care and
something called ``The American Way.'' It's a political issue cheat
sheet one might pocket before heading out to a local bar. There,
Trumpisms can be tossed off like so many beer nuts. To wit: New
York is ``the hottest city on the planet''; politics is a
``special-interest cesspool''; Pat Buchanan has ``totally lost
it''; and Bill Bradley is ``a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump's ``buck-stops-here'' solutions, often buttressed by
informative statistics, might ring truer were they not delivered in
such a patronizing tone. To be sure, Trump serves up some real
whoppers among the occasional sound judgments. For North Korea,
Trump advocates an aggressive disarmament. Great, but how?
Dilapidated schools, he opines, could be completely refurbished by
diverting the $50 billion spent on armed forces in Europe. So much
for NATO. As for crime, Trump would gladly carry out the death
penalty in public.
</P>
<P>
   Although inspired by Minnesota's new governor, Jesse Ventura,
Trump's views skew less toward the Reform Party and more toward the
Grand Old Party. His Republican loyalty shines through ad nauseam
praise of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and a severe case of
Ronald Reagan hero-worship.
</P>
<P>
   Trump musters great passion about the need to eradicate
inner-city crime and improve education. Unfortunately, these
moments of lucidity get lost in the braggadocio that has kept Trump
in the boardroom, and, so far, out of the White House.

 &HT;    'DIGITAL DIVIDE' POSES CHALLENGE TO FIRST 'E-LECTION'
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's first Internet election, hailed by its
backers as a historic breakthrough, risks running afoul of federal
voting rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the process ends Saturday, there'll be a trial on the
fundamental question of fairness'' because many minority voters
lack access to the Internet, said Miller Baker, a Washington
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   A federal lawsuit being pressed by Baker seeks to nullify the
online presidential primary being held by Arizona Democrats from
Tuesday through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit could help decide whether the so-called ``digital
divide'' raises legal barriers against virtual voting.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported last year that 19 percent of
African-Americans and 16 percent of Hispanics have Internet access
from any location, compared to 38 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet voting may well be widely accepted in 10 or 15
years,'' Baker noted. ``But we're not there yet. As it stands, this
process offers unfair access to remote Internet users.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker represents the Voting Integrity Project, a Virginia-based
nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in a Phoenix courtroom, U.S. District Judge Paul
Rosenblatt refused the group's request for a temporary restraining
order to halt the election, the first legally binding public
election ever held on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not dismiss the case, saying the results might have
to be set aside if it's proved that the voting was biased against
minorities and the poor because they have less Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Since Arizona is one of the few non-Southern states covered
under the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Attorney General Janet Reno also
had to approve the online voting scheme. At the time, Reno noted
that the Justice Department planned to monitor the virtual vote
closely.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit will have scant impact on the Democratic National
Convention. If the election is eventually overturned, the slate of
Arizona delegates chosen will be seated as unpledged, rather than
as bound supporters of Vice President Al Gore or former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think we're helping democracy work,'' said Joe
Mohen, the chief executive officer of election.com, which has been
hired by the Arizona Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'digital divide' is a misnomer,'' Mohen said, disputing
the Commerce Department figures as outdated. ``We're giving people
more choices and more opportunities to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohen also noted that the Democratic contest was the first one
ever held in the United States where voters were free to enter any
of 125 polling places in Arizona on Election Day, which is
Saturday, and cast their ballots at an Internet kiosk.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Lewis, executive director of the Houston-based Election
Centre(cq) research group, said the mounting pressure for so-called
E-lections comes ``before the necessary safety and security
features have been built into the process.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Mohen said nearly all aspects of the virtual election
were running smoothly, including the security features built into
the company's Web site. They require voters to furnish three
separate pieces of personal authentication data, including a unique
numerical code mailed to each of the state's registered Democrats
last month.
</P>
<P>
   What problems had arisen, Mohen said, mostly involved would-be
voters with antiquated Internet browsers that proved unable to
handle election.com's Java-driven technology.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Wednesday, less than halfway through the online voting
period, about 18,500 ballots had been cast online, Mohen reported.
That compares to the 12,200 conventional ballots cast in 1996, when
President Clinton ran unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fleisher, the Democratic party chairman in Arizona, also
claimed the system was secure. ``Somebody has to be first,'' he
said. ``If you want to see elections on the Internet, you have to
jump in.''

CHINESE EX-OFFICIAL EXECUTED IN CRACKDOWN ON CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China executed a former provincial vice governor
Wednesday for taking bribes. He is the highest official put to
death for corruption in the 50 years since the Communists came to
power. The execution made good on Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's
promise this week to stamp out the rampant corruption that extends
to the highest ranks of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Hu Changqing, the former vice governor of eastern Jiangxi
Province and a former deputy director of the state Bureau of
Religious Affairs, was sentenced to death in February for taking
bribes worth more than $600,000. He was executed Wednesday after
the Supreme People's Court rejected his appeal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both the timing of the execution, just days after Zhu's speech,
and extensive publicity made it clear that the Communist Party
intends to make an example of Hu. Party officials are well aware
that widespread corruption among officials and their families has
seriously damaged the party's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where executions are often quietly meted out, Hu's
death _ and his misdeeds _ were featured in the official press and
on the main evening news, which showed Hu, a small balding man in a
business suit, being escorted by police guards. Even Daily Focus,
China's popular investigative television news magazine, devoted its
entire show to Hu's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``For such a flagrant criminal, only the death penalty is
sufficient to safeguard national law, satisfy popular indignation,
rectify the party work style and fight against corruption,'' said a
commentary Wednesday in The People's Daily, the main Communist
Party newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The commentary urged officials to draw lessons from the case and
not to be ``attracted by all sorts of temptations during reform and
opening to the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opening speech to the yearly session of parliament on
Sunday, Zhu repeatedly referred to corruption as one of China's
most pressing issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``All major cases, no matter which department or who is
involved, must be thoroughly investigated and corrupt officials
must be severely punished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who is widely admired by Chinese as upright and honest, has
made the fight against corruption something of a personal crusade,
and his anti-corruption campaign has wide popular support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pressing issue for the party,'' said a party member
and researcher at a government think tank, ``There are many people,
myself included, who feel that the party is now just as corrupt as
the Kuomintang.'' The Kuomintang governed China before 1949.
</P>
<P>
   But Hu, though quite senior, was not among the party's top
elite.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when the wife of the Beijing party chief, Jia
Qinglin, was linked to a $10 billion-dollar smuggling ring
involving the giant Yuanhua Co. on Xiamen Island in southern China,
the government propaganda machine went out of its way to profess
her innocence. Although the case has not been officially reported
in China, many people in Beijing have followed it closely, via the
Internet from Hong Kong, and a few snippets have appeared in
newspapers and magazines based in southern China.
</P>
<P>
   Jia is a protege of President Jiang Zemin and was brought to
Beijing specifically because he was regarded as an honest
administrator. His predecessor, Chen Xitong, was sentenced to 16
years in prison last year for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In official interviews, Jia's wife, Lin Youfan, said she had
never even heard of Yuanhua, which many Chinese say is hard to
believe since she was head of a large import-export company in
Xiamen until two years ago. They believe she is being spared to
protect her husband's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the party is serious about cracking down on corruption,
but I've still not seen any real willingness to go above a certain
level,'' said a Western diplomat who requested anonymity. ``The
people who are being arrested are those who are dispensable, or
whose connections are not good _ or at least not as good as they
thought they were.''

<P>
   In wars of the future, intelligent, morphing robots slither and
hop along battlefields, scoping out enemy lines and even rescuing
fallen soldiers. They come by land, by air and by sea, doing
dangerous work in place of humans.
</P>
<P>
   And the unlikely heroes in these robot wars may be no farther
away than your photocopier.
</P>
<P>
   The Xerox Corp., known for its innovations in document handling,
has developed a modular, shape-shifting robot. The Xerox
researchers envision their work with this robot leading not only to
battlefield scouts or medics, but also to rescue devices,
self-configuring, modular furniture, toys that can change their
appearance and function and, perhaps, even a fold-up photocopier.
</P>
<P>
   The robot, named Polybot, is novel because it is many robots in
one. Small modules link with one another to form larger structures
and to shift into new shapes like snakes, loops and spiders, each
with its own method of movement.
</P>
<P>
   The modules are packed with things like sensors to note location
and environment, computers to control actions and actuators to
provide movement. The set of modules takes its power from a cable
that plugs into an outlet, although portable batteries will
eventually be used.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of Polybot, and robots like it, is versatility.
``The one advantage of the system is the ability to be very mobile
through unstructured environments,'' said Mark Yim, a researcher at
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in California and the inventor of
Polybot.
</P>
<P>
   Robots that can adapt their shape and movement to suit the
environment _ whether on a mountain, in a desert or even underwater
_ will have a leg up over robots with a single, fixed form.
</P>
<P>
   Such a robot, for instance, could take the shape of a loop and
roll over flat terrain. Encountering an obstacle, the loop could
break, become snakelike and slither around it. In rough terrain,
the snake could curl into a figure 8 and break apart again to form
a four-legged creature that resembled a spider. Currently, Polybot
can change form but not in response to changes in its environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fantastic idea,'' said Roger Quinn, a professor at Case
Western Reserve University who is developing a robot that jumps
like a cricket. ``In robotics now, you don't even have commercially
viable legged robots. If you could do it in a modular way so it
could transform itself into different modes of mobility just based
on the terrain, that would be really much better.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Polybot has 24 identical modules, each about six
centimeters on a side. In a year and a half, Yim said, Polybot will
have hundreds of modules, allowing it to take on even more forms
and handle new tasks.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of adaptability is a major advantage over traditional
robots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to build robots to solve particular tasks, and when
the task changes we need to plug in a new robot,'' said Kevin
Lynch, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at
Northwestern University. ``By the time we've figured out how to
install them in this particular task, they've become outdated. It
would have been easier to use humans.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may not be enough to use robots that simply change shape.
On-board computers will have to understand the laws of physics.
``You want your structure to take into account the dynamics of
motion,'' said Daniela Rus, an assistant professor of computer
science at Dartmouth College. ``You don't want the robot to fall
flat on its face while it's moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, Case Western Reserve and nine other organizations are
being financed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
the research and development arm of the Department of Defense, to
develop revolutionary robot designs.
</P>
<P>
   The military has set goals and deadlines for each project. By
2001, for example, Polybot will have to be larger and more
responsive to its environment.
</P>
<P>
   Yim is optimistic, but he said that modular, self-reconfiguring
robots must clear some hurdles before they become a viable
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will be difficult,'' Yim said, ``will be programming them
_ how to get them so they don't fight each other, so they all work
toward the common goal. When you have a lot of modules, the
computational aspects become exponentially more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Handling flawed modules will also be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you have a million modules,'' Yim said. ``You're
almost guaranteed that some of them will be broken. It's no longer
a catastrophic failure, but some proportion of the system will be
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   The field of modular and reconfigurable robotics dates back to
the 1980s, with early research in Japan and the United States. Only
four groups of American researchers and a few in Japan are
currently studying the technology, Rus said.
</P>
<P>
   Pradeep Khosla, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon
University, developed reconfiguring robotic arms more than 10 years
ago. Today, Khosla studies the problem of writing software for
robots that change shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1988 there was a notion that robot arms had a very
specific architecture, and once you built an arm it stayed that
way,'' he said. ``What we did at that time was put forth this novel
idea, this modular and reconfigurable technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Yim, who was studying for his PhD at the time, got hold of the
idea, Khosla said. ``What he's demonstrating is what we did for
robotic arms can be done for mobile robots,'' Khosla said.
</P>
<P>
   Applications for modular robots extend far beyond snakes that
can become spiders. In rescue operations, groups of robots could
link together to form support structures for falling buildings. As
modules can be made smaller, robots will morph into objects with
more complex shapes, like hammers, wrenches and pliers.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are always toys. A robot that forms
different shapes and objects on command might make an exciting
gadget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've showed this,'' Yim said of Polybot, ``they
all say this would be a really cool toy. The toy market is one that
we might start looking into.''  &QL;

   A: We puzzled for a time over this question but eventually found
your mat in the Bits &AMP; Pieces catalog. With this felt mat, you
simply roll up your partially finished jigsaw and all the assorted
pieces around a tube. Then you attach the elastic bands and file it
away for later use. The mat, which measures 36 by 48-inches, is
$14.95 and fits puzzles up to 2,000 pieces. 1-800-544-7297; (item
No. 12-K7762).

   Q: My family and I have fallen in love with Yorkshire pudding.
The only time we can get it is when my mother in-law goes to Canada
and brings back packages of it. Is there any place in Atlanta where
we can buy these mixes? _ Barry Winkler, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: This British treat of flour, eggs and milk is often baked in
the drippings of roasted meat. ``It is a popular accompaniment to
roast beef in Britain, and the two together compose the
`traditional' Sunday lunch,'' writes Alan Davidson, author of ``The
Oxford Companion to Food'' (Oxford University Press, $60). We found
a 4.5-ounce box of Whitworths Yorkshire Pudding &AMP; Pancake mix,
$2.59, at Taste of Britain, 73 S. Peachtree St., Norcross
(770-242-8585).
</P>
<P>
   Davidson also writes, ``sometimes the batter is poured into
smaller round tins to make individual puddings, but this is not the
authentic Yorkshire method. Strictly speaking, the pudding, cut in
squares, should be served with gravy before the meat, to take the
edge off the appetite.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for a kitchen timer in the shape of a cow. I know
they exist, but I've tried a number of stores, with no luck Can you
help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kaelie Crews, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Attention, fans of bovines. We located your cow timer in the
Harriet Carter catalog for $7.98 (item No. C5464); 1-800-377-7878
or www.harrietcartergifts.com. The timer, which gives a country
look to any countertop, is a snap to use. Simply set the timer and
when the time elapses, it sounds off with a loud ``moo.'' A battery
is included with each order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a clock that shows the time on the ceiling,
although I think the clock is also capable of ringing an alarm.
This would be a great clock for the deaf, so can you tell me where
I can locate one?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anneice Capple, Riverdale, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Ceiling Time II clock by Howard Miller will light up your
night. This black matte-finish model, which also travels well, is
$53.99 at Champ's Clock Shop, 3834 King Drive, Douglasville
(770-942-2128). Simply position the swiveling projector to project
the time on the wall or ceiling. Then see the five-second
illumination with a touch of the light button. The clock also
offers an alarm and a snooze button.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to find a store that still carries Lilt home
permaments. The last place I saw a kit was at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nola Hinson, Conley, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: You will soon be a curly head with a Lilt Home Permanent. We
found the perms (Lilt Foam, $5.99; Lilt Lotion, $5.49) at Drug
Emporium, 2625 Piedmont Road N.E. (404-233-1201). Each kit contains
waving foam or lotion, neutralizer and sponge end-wraps. Note: The
manufacturer warns, ``Do not perm if your hair has been bleached or
double-processed, treated with a cream relaxer, streaked or if you
have shown a negative reaction or sensitivity to perm products.''

WHY I VOTED FOR BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the most exciting Republican presidential primary in my
lifetime came to town this week, and I voted for . . . Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, let me rephrase that: I voted against Al Gore. With his
disgraceful truckling to the race-baiting Al Sharpton, Bradley
disqualified himself months ago as a worthy contender for
president; I could never have been for him, even if he hadn't been
the most left-wing candidate in the race. But it was clear by
Tuesday that Bradley was about to exit the race, so it was safe to
vote for him as a way of protesting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Gore didn't notice my protest. So why for the
first time since I began voting in presidential elections did I
boycott the GOP presidential primary? Voters by the millions
swarmed to the John McCain-George W. Bush showdown, and I couldn't
bring myself to vote for either one?
</P>
<P>
   Well _ no.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly I would prefer either man to the Democrats' champion.
I am not sure the country can withstand four more years of what
McCain dubbed ``the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.'' If it isn't universally obvious by now just how dishonest
and ruthless the vice president can be in the pursuit of power, it
will be by November.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans owe the voters more than candidates who are
merely not as bad as the incumbents. And for all the excitement and
energy of the GOP contest, neither McCain nor Bush, it seemed to me
on Tuesday, had made the case that he was the right man to
recapture the White House for his party.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, a Republican nominee ought to have a clear
philosophy of governance. It ought to be evident that there are
basic conservative principles that would be the cornerstone of his
presidency. Yet who can say, even now, what the cornerstone of a
Bush or McCain administration would be?
</P>
<P>
   ``What Does W. Stand For?'' asked The New Republic in a headline
last spring. It was a question no one seemed able to answer, least
of all the candidate. Well into the summer, Bush was flatly
refusing to take stands on issues. ``I will be glad to answer all
those questions once I get out in the course of the campaign,'' he
would say when reporters asked for his views. All the while, of
course, he was raising millions of dollars and collecting
endorsements by the barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he began delivering formal speeches and issuing
position papers. But to this day, it is far from apparent that
there is a core of ideas that informs Bush's approach to
government, or that he has given much thought to why he wants to be
president. And he often sounds hopelessly out of his depth. Does he
have an opinion, he was asked late last year, on Russia's prime
minister, Vladimir Putin? ``I really don't,'' Bush answered. ``I
will if I'm the president.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush's Republican philosophy of government was murky,
meanwhile, McCain's was nonexistent. With few exceptions, the only
issues on which he carved out clear positions were the ones on
which he abandoned his party's conservative ideology of limited
government and greater freedom. On campaign finance and tobacco, he
stood for a vast increase in federal power; on taxes, he came out
against meaningful cuts in every bracket, the only path to genuine
relief.
</P>
<P>
   As Rich Lowry of National Review astutely observed, McCain
campaigned for president largely on the way he campaigned for
president. Instead of running on issues, he ran on mood and feel:
Vote for me because I'm an insurgent, because I pledge to clean up
politics, because I'll return your government to you, because I'm
ornery and unscripted, because I'm not your typical Republican.
Independents and Democrats, especially those in the press, loved
hearing a Republican talk this way. But for conservatives and
traditional Republicans, McCain was like Oakland: There was no
there there.
</P>
<P>
   What kept me away from the GOP primary, though, was more than
just the mush at the heart of the Bush and McCain campaigns. I was
also repelled by the candidates' cheap shots and nasty attacks.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot remember a Republican primary fight that sank to the
depths of this one. Slimy e-mails accusing McCain of fathering
illegitimate children. Sleazy ``Catholic voter alerts'' implying
that Bush is a Protestant bigot. Ronald Reagan's famous 11th
Commandment has always been honored more in the breach than the
observance. But McCain and Bush went way past the foul line in
speaking ill of their fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Texas governor deserved a smack for making his stand
at Bob Jones University _ but an unhinged assault on Jerry Falwell
and Pat Robertson as ``forces of evil'' and ``agents of
intolerance'' who resemble Sharpton and the vile Louis Farrakhan?
And sure, it was fair to whack McCain from the left, since he was
wooing left-leaning voters _ but to slam him as a foe of clean air?
Or an enemy of women with breast cancer? At their worst, these two
behaved like disciples of Al Gore. And it is Gore who will benefit
from the wounds they inflicted on their party.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of scandal and deceit in the executive branch,
this campaign season was tailor-made for an inspiring Republican
message of honesty, hopefulness, decency, and liberty. What Bush
and McCain produced was something rather different. Something
rather less. It was nothing I cared to vote for.

WITH 2 NEW CHIPS, THE GIGAHERTZ DECADE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The era of gigahertz computing has arrived. Advanced Micro
Devices this week became the first semiconductor company to mass
produce a personal computer microprocessor with a speed of 1
gigahertz, or 1,000 megahertz, or a billion electronic heartbeats
per second. Intel Corp., which had not planned to introduce its own
gigahertz chip until the second half of the year, quickly followed
with its own high-speed Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq and Gateway, using Advanced Micro's Athlon chip, are
already taking orders for new gigahertz PCs and expect to deliver
them by the end of the month. Hewlett-Packard, Dell, IBM and others
will catch up quickly with gigahertz machines based on the Intel
Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   Like the four-minute mile or the arrival of the year 2000, the
milestone is mainly symbolic, and life will pretty much go on as
normal, which is to say faster and faster. The arrival of the first
mass-produced gigahertz chips is significant mainly for bragging
rights among computer engineers and power-hungry consumers who want
the extra speed for manipulating graphics and disintegrating their
opponents in three-dimensional shoot-'em-up games.
</P>
<P>
   As is almost always the case when newer and faster processors
are introduced, the real significance of the arrival of gigahertz
chips is that computer makers will now cut prices on existing PC's
to make room for the new speed demons at the high end. To make room
for its gigahertz Athlon, for example, Advanced Micro Designs
recently slashed prices of ``older'' chips like the 800-megaherz
Athlon, introduced just two months ago, by as much as 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new AMD and Intel processors mark the beginning of an era
when we start measuring PC performance in gigahertz (a billion
computational cycles per second) instead of megahertz (a million
cycles per second), but what does that really mean for consumers?
Faster performance, obviously, for processor-intensive applications
like games and graphics, including digital photography, digital
video editing and Web page design.
</P>
<P>
   But for most consumers, computers in what can now be called the
half-gigahertz range (500 MHz) are more than adequate for standard
applications like word processing, e-mail and Web browsing, where
the speed of the user's fingers, eyes and brain are the controlling
factors. And those computers are going to become more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   It is compulsory at this point to note that processor speed is
simply one measure of a computer's performance, and an often
unreliable one at that. One company's 500-MHz computer can
outperform another's 700-MHz computer, for example, and one
chipmaker's gigahertz chip may perform better than a rival chip
rated at the same speed.
</P>
<P>
   Other system components, including the memory subsystem (RAM and
cache), the graphics card and the hard disk, also affect the
overall speed of a computer. In the Internet era, a faster modem or
a high-speed cable or DSL connection will almost always have a much
higher payoff in overall system performance than a few extra
megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   And spending a few hours studying a computer or software manual,
or a couple of hundred dollars for a good computer class, will
almost certainly improve your productivity much more than a
processor upgrade. A computer that sits idle while you try to
figure out what button to push has an effective speed of 0
gigahertz.
</P>
<P>
   One of my first personal computers had an Intel 8086 processor
that clocked out at what was then a stunning 4.77 MHz. When Intel
later came out with a 33-MHz 80286 processor, the occasion left me
breathless and dizzy with power. ``It will leave scorch marks on
your desk,'' I wrote, which today leaves blush marks on my cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   If Moore's Law that processing power doubles every 18 months
holds true, a measly gigahertz may seem laughable a decade from
now. Even as it announced the new 1-GHz Athlon chip, Advanced Micro
was showing off a prototype of a 1.1-GHz chip code named
Thunderbird, which is based on a copper manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the gigahertz chip is hot stuff.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, the first computers built around a
gigahertz processor are going to be expensi chips will
initially cost PC makers more than $1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's Athlon-based Presario 5900Z system with the new
gigahertz chip will have a base price of $2,499, plus tax and
shipping. The system will include a conventional 17-inch monitor,
128 megabytes of system memory, a 30-GB hard disk, a 40X CD-ROM
drive, a 56K modem, a 16-MB Diamond Stealth video card with 2X AGP
graphics, JBL Pro Speakers and Firewire ports for digital video
editing.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario 5900Z-1000 is offered only through Compaq's
build-to-order Web site or telephone sales line. Compaq says it
will be able to deliver a system within 10 days of an order.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate screamer appears to be Dell's Special Edition
Dimension computer featuring a gigahertz Pentium III chip from
Intel. The system includes 256 megabytes of Rambus-based high-speed
memory, a 30-GB hard drive, a ``dual data rate'' geForce AGP 4X
graphics card with 64 megabytes of video memory (the equivalent of
128 megabytes with dual data rate), a 12X DVD-ROM drive, an 8X
CD-RW drive, a Soundblaster Live sound card with four Altec Lansing
THX-certified speakers and a subwoofer the size of a small
suitcase, and a 17-inch flat-panel display screen. A Dell spokesman
said final pricing had not been set, but would be ``less than
$6,000,'' which in marketing code means $5,999.99.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has been troubled recently by parts shortages that have
delayed some orders of high-end computers for weeks or months, and
the company said it would not set a date for availability of the
Special Edition Dimension, other than ``when it's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, 1-GHz computers are creeping closer to the level
of power needed to do speech recognition, which will allow people
to operate their computers by voice instead of keyboard and mouse
commands. But experts say true speech recognition is still several
years away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers at International Business Machines'
research center in Austin, Texas, took time this week to show me a
prototype of their new Power4 processor system, which effectively
combines a couple of gigahertz-level processors on a single chip
along with a supporting infrastructure that feeds them bits at a
rate of 100 gigabytes per second, a monstrous amount of data that
IBM says is the equivalent of 20 full-length DVD movies. The Power4
system will appear first in the high-end computers known as
servers, which operate behind the scenes as the main engines for
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the networked world of the Internet, a server built around
Power4 chips is likely to have much more of an impact on your
personal computer than a gigahertz chip on your desk, because it
will enable, for example, faster response times on eBay auctions or
speedier delivery of search requests.
</P>
<P>
   One final technical note: After failing to persuade the rest of
the world that the 21st century and the new millennium do not
really begin until Jan. 1, 2001, I am very reluctant to note that
the proper pronunciation of ``gigahertz'' is with a soft G, as in
gigantic and gee whiz, instead of a hard G, as in grumble and
grouse. Obviously this is another losing battle, so I guess I'll
just have to get giggy with it.

<P>
   The race to build the ultimate wired home is on. Near Seattle,
Bill Gates has his digital dream palace. Across the country, cable
providers and phone companies are pushing broadband Internet access
for the rest of us. In Europe, the appliance manufacturer
Electrolux is even working on a way to put the family refrigerator
online.
</P>
<P>
   But the home security business might just beat them all to the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, security companies have been wiring houses with
central nervous systems of motion sensors and computer controls.
Now those installations are adopting more sophisticated wireless
technology and are starting to be exploited for home automation;
such systems will soon help residents manage things like the family
computer and the living room audio system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart home of the future is all about the
interconnectivity of appliances,'' said Timothy McKinney, vice
president for residential sales and marketing at ADT Security
Services, one of the largest providers of security products. ``We
already let you arm your house. We might as well let you check your
voice-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Lucent Technologies began marketing a home network
called the HomeStar Wiring System through ADT. By plugging various
home devices into a built-in network like HomeStar, a resident
might, say, set a videocassette recorder with the same control used
to manage the alarm system.
</P>
<P>
   For a house that is smart as well as secure, the usual keypad
control mounted near the front door could be replaced by a touch
screen that could display a wide array of information and controls.
If a homeowner was going away for a few days, for example, the
touch screen could be used to set the alarm and to program the
audio system to play in the evenings so the house would seem
occupied. It might also be used to control the thermostat so the
family hamster would be snug at night.
</P>
<P>
   On ordinary days, this same control unit could be used to record
and relay voice messages. (``Honey, the schnitzel is thawing on the
counter.'') During the mad morning dash to the office, a homeowner
could simultaneously arm the alarm and read the latest traffic
report off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of services will start becoming available this year
and are likely to be hot topics at next week's international
security conference in Las Vegas. Prices have yet to be set.
``We're working with focus groups to see what the market will
bear,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that kind of expanded home-security automation has
been largely the domain of high-tech hobbyists. For more than 20
years, X10, a Hong Kong company with an American base in Closter,
N.J., has been engineering popular do-it-yourself home security
networks with features like video surveillance and
remote-controlled lighting. A newer product called Active Home lets
the homeowner manage all those controls through software that runs
on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been natural for people to want this kind of basic
integration,'' said Peter Lesser, president of X10 USA and chairman
of the integrated home systems division of the Consumer Electronics
Association. X10's modular technology, which is used by companies
like ADT and the Ademco Group, provides an alternative for people
who do not wish to pay others to install and maintain the systems.
Approximately 95 percent of sales take place over the Internet,
Lesser said.
</P>
<P>
   Though these homemade systems can cost as little as $25, they
are part of a formidable industry. Last year, consumers spent $6
billion on securing their homes, according to the Securities
Industry Association. David Saddler, director of communications for
the association, said the interest in home automation was expected
to be an important factor in the expansion of home security
businesses. ``The ability to integrate different technologies is
responsible for the most significant changes in the industry,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes include an expansion of wireless services, which
add more flexibility for the basic alarm system, the backbone of
home automation.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Lustig, the senior vice president for marketing at Ademco,
a Pittway Corp. division that produces security equipment, said
that 30 percent of all systems being sold now featured some type of
wireless capability. That number is expected to rise to 35 percent
or 40 percent by next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ademco's system relies on its 300-megahertz frequency, part of
the band set aside for the Federal Communications Commission for
wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless systems work much like wired systems, connecting
sensors at the house or business to a central control unit that
communicates with the security service's monitoring station. That
strategy dates from the 1800s, when night watchmen used telegraphs
to signal for help from the fire department or the police.
</P>
<P>
   In many places today, the night watchman has been replaced by an
array of electronic sensors. Positioned throughout the house, the
devices can detect things like changes in temperature, broken glass
and fluctuations in sound waves. When a sensor indicates that
someone may have broken into a house, the sensor transmits an
identifying serial number to the main control unit, which sounds
the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, the control unit dials the monitoring station
and sends electronic transmissions that identify the house's
location as well as the point of entry. Newer systems communicate
with cellular phone technology rather than phone lines so residents
do not have to worry about lines being cut. The entire
communication process occurs within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The only human interaction in the chain occurs when the central
station's representative calls the residents to verify that a
break-in has occurred. If a resident does not respond or provide
the password, the security system employee calls the local police
department. As of now, most police stations are not equipped to
receive that kind of information electronically _ wirelessly or
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless innovations are smartening up personal security as
well. Later this year, Ademco will release a product developed with
Timex that gives new meaning to a wristwatch alarm. By pressing a
button on the watch, the wearer can arm or disarm a home security
system. A person within a given range can also hit a panic button,
which will set off the house alarm.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A similar personal security technology is being offered by ADT
to victims of domestic abuse in a program called the Abused Women's
Active Response Emergency program, or Aware. The program gives
electronic security pendants to women selected from around the
country. Pressing a button on the pendant sends a signal to a local
monitoring station, which can immediately dispatch help. If the
wearer is in her home or near it, the signal will set off her house
alarm, too.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless transmission range for personal security devices is
becoming less of an issue. Later this year, ADT will introduce a
Global Positioning System monitoring device that will be marketed
to parents. The device, McKinney said, is to be slipped into a
child's backpack. Throughout the day and night, a parent will be
able to press a button to find out the child's location. So much
for sneaking off to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these innovations in personal and residential security,
don't expect the race for smart homes to end any time soon.
``Security companies have an advantage because they're already in
the home,'' said Billy Pidgeon, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications, a technology research firm in New York. ``But I
don't see a compelling consumer application that's going to drive
adoption of this yet.''

A SITE FOR THE FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(af) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, the shifting sands. Fort Zinderneuf. Soldiers of fortune
with no past. Oui, mon capitaine. Buster Crabbe in ``Captain
Gallant.'' Gary Cooper in ``Beau Geste.'' Gene Hackman in ``March
or Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Now you can remember all those men who joined to forget all
those women, because the French Foreign Legion did not march out
with the final credits. In fact, the Legion Etrangere is not only
alive, with recent service in trouble spots like Chad and Bosnia,
but it has its own Web site
(www.info-france-usa.org/america/embassy/legion/legion.htm),
courtesy of the French Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1831, 902 officers, 3,176 noncommissioned officers and
more than 30,000 legionnaires have died for France, one-third of
them while fighting directly for the defense of the country,'' the
site reports. ``Foreigners by birth, the legionnaires have become
Frenchmen by the blood they have spilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy's site has a short history of the legion from its
founding in Algeria to modern times. While it is most identified
with North Africa in cinematic imagination, its most celebrated
battle occurred in Mexico in 1863, at an inn named Camerone in Palo
Verde, near Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   There, at the French equivalent of the Alamo, three officers and
62 legionnaires resisted 2,000 Mexicans. ``After a day of heroic
fighting, the last five survivors fixed bayonets and charged.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also covers some of the legion's traditions, its code
of honor, its uniform and music. But the English-language site is
there for a practical purpose, not just nostalgia: to answer the
questions of would-be recruits (ages 17 to 40) about enlistment
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legionnaire is seldom an angel but never a criminal,'' the
site says. ``Once he has joined, under an assumed name if he
wishes, the legionnaire enjoys an unequaled protection for as long
as he serves because of the anonymity rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Less official but equally heartfelt sites, created by
ex-legionnaires or admirers, offer more information than the
embassy's. One can listen to legion songs at
home.talkcity.com/spiritcir/lediable, a site created by Collin Rae
Smith, a former legion corporal (1994-99).
</P>
<P>
   Those thinking about joining, he adds, should be able to run
2,800 meters (about one and three-quarter miles) in 12 minutes or
less and climb a 20-foot rope using only the arms.
</P>
<P>
   Smith describes basic training at one of the legion's ``farms'':
running, French lessons, combat training, rope climbing and more
running. ``The evenings are usually spent by learning legion songs
(the legion takes singing very seriously) or night marches,'' he
writes. Then comes the Kepi Blanc march, 80 to 100 kilometers (50
to 62 miles) over two or three days in full gear. Basic enlistment
for those who make it is five years.
</P>
<P>
   The legion is not for weaklings, but, despite the escapist
image, it is not for losers, either. It is a highly professional
outfit, now based in Aubagne, near Marseille. Most of its officers
and about 40 percent of its men are French.
</P>
<P>
   Specialized units include underwater demolitions teams and an
elite paratrooper regiment, which is very difficult to enter and is
based in Corsica. ``The Jungle Training School in French Guiana is
the best on the planet,'' Larry B. Lambert wrote by e-mail. The
legion has 8,000 members and accepts 1,300 men for training each
year out of about 10,000 applicants, his site says.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert has perhaps the most thorough English-language legion
site on the Web 
(users.deltanet.com/users/llambert/public(underscore)html/legion(und
erscore)index.html), especially for military history. It chronicles
the legion in the world wars; Africa; Indochina, including the
siege of Dien Bien Phu; and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The site is illustrated with color photographs of historic
legion recruiting posters, worth a visit all by themselves. (Asked
to say something about himself, Lambert replied, in appropriate
legion fashion, ``I'd rather not.'')
</P>
<P>
   There is also a biography of John Hasey, who enlisted in 1940 in
a Free French unit of the legion and was badly wounded the next
year. Among the 1,036 Companions of the Liberation, honored by De
Gaulle for having done the most to free France from German
occupation, there are two Americans: John Hasey and Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is still under construction, a site by Thierry de
Cervens, a surgeon (www.cervens.net), should be a required tour of
duty. It is partly a memorial to his father, Guy Rubin de Cervens,
a decorated captain of the legion's paratroopers who died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It shows the legion's insignia, medals, uniforms and current
assignments. Its archives section has an open message board where
former legionnaires tell what it was really like. It lists famous
legionnaires, including Capitaine Danjou, hero of Camerone. And it
reprints a 1991 thank-you letter from a new honorary legionnaire,
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf.

SATIRE SO TAME IT TAKES THE FUN OUT OF `GOD, THE DEVIL AND BOB' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   Everyone's a critic. At least two NBC affiliates, one in Salt
Lake City, the other in Pocatello, Idaho, say they will refuse to
air ``God, the Devil and Bob'' when it premieres Thursday night.
Each station is in a community where the Mormon Church dominates
the spiritual side of life (and a lot more), and where irreverence
goes down harder than an aspirin without water.
</P>
<P>
   They'd probably get less notice if they just said the show isn't
airing because it isn't funny. But stations that pre-sanitize for
their viewers' protection probably don't have the greatest senses
of humor and most likely wouldn't know funny from fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't have stations worrying about bruising their
feelings, ``God, the Devil and Bob'' may be remembered as the
dullest example of irreverence since Sister Maurice jabbed me in
the nose during my altar-boy days and I bled like an ``ER'' goner
all over my white surplice.
</P>
<P>
   Sister's initial reaction to the playful jab was priceless. But
when I explained that I could get a nosebleed just by thinking
about it, she seemed strangely disappointed, almost let down that
the moment wasn't as funny/dramatic as it started out.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to get the same feeling from ``God, the Devil and
Bob,'' especially after knowing that James Garner is doing the
voice of God in this animated series. There could be no better
voice to give life to an all-knowing, all-seeing, all-laconic deity
than the guy who was both Bret Maverick and Jim Rockford. The fact
that God looks like Jerry Garcia is also a cute fillip, but Garner
doesn't get the necessary support from writers who are obviously
holding back for network TV. Thus, what we get is satire so tame it
wouldn't bite even if it had teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this midseason entry, which launches after
``Friends'' Thursday but moves to Tuesdays at 8:30 next week, is
that God is thinking of ``chucking the whole thing and starting
over,'' to use the big guy's own words.
</P>
<P>
   The devil, delighted at this news, tries to goad God into
pulling the plug right now, but God decides to give humankind one
more chance. He says if one person can prove to him that the world
is worth saving, he'll back off. To be fair, God lets the devil
choose the unwitting schmo who must save the world: a
beer-drinking, porn-watching guy named Bob Alman (voiced by French
Stewart).
</P>
<P>
   God admits Bob isn't a showroom-floor sample of his best work,
but he relents: ``OK, a deal's a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The devil replies: ``And if he fails, you'll destroy the whole
thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tease me,'' the devil warns, ``like with the
flood.''
</P>
<P>
   God replies: ``When are you going to let that go?''
</P>
<P>
   This is about as irreverent as ``God, the Devil and Bob'' gets,
unless you count the part where Bob is in bed explaining this
impossible mission to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna, this is serious,'' he says. ``God has literally put the
fate of mankind in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And these would be the same hands that are inching up my
nightie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a little confidence builder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good night, Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, when in doubt, go with the sex joke. Just like
every other lame sitcom of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The show, created by a former seminary student who had a hand in
two truly forgettable series ``Men Behaving Badly'' and
``Townies,'' kept me thinking of ``The Simpsons,'' as in, ``This
would be so much better if `The Simpsons' people were doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson,
lends her voice to Bob's rebellious daughter, Megan, but the
``Simpsons'' magic hasn't rubbed off, despite a mother lode of
irreverent possibilities. On cable, in fact, ``God, the Devil and
Bob'' would probably be funny as hell. On NBC, it's more like
purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   God, the Devil and Bob. Half-hour animated comedy about an
average guy chosen to redeem mankind. Voices by James Garner,
French Stewart, Alan Cumming, Laurie Metcalf, Nancy Cartwright and
Kath Soucie. Series premieres Thursday night on NBC, moves to
Tuesdays next week. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In most mythology, the underworld is a serious and
not necessarily pleasant place. It's a place you want to get out
of. Hell, for example. An analogy might be drawn to the New York
subway, whose riders, let's face it, want out.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, when a vast capital improvement program has made the
subway system significantly cleaner, safer, more efficient, more
comfortable and even more attractive than it has been in decades,
life underground resists cheeriness. So, when a bright, playful
design element blossoms in our municipal nether world, it deserves
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, MetroCard vending machines have begun to
appear underground. Usually tucked into station corners near the
token booths, they sit like electronic trolls, splashed with
cartoon colors, their screens and message boards blinking and
flashing.
</P>
<P>
   Children sometimes stand in front of these machines and play.
The touch screens, as they come up, are colorful and wonderfully
legible, so that even a 6-year-old can read them. The colors change
from screen to screen, and text boxes advance or recede, enlarging
or diminishing in size. Usually, it's a good enough show to elicit
smiles _ and sometimes laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Adults tend to approach with an air of wary determination,
intently regarding the screen and carefully pressing it after
reading all possible options several times. As the transaction
progresses, the muscles around mouth and eyes relax, the pace picks
up, and after the MetroCard is successfully plucked from the
dispenser, users often leave with something like jauntiness in
their step.
</P>
<P>
   All of this _ the engaging appearance and the ease of use _ is a
textbook case of how design improvements, small in themselves, have
a kind of leverage that allows them to slightly alter, gently
nudge, the urban spirit up a notch. Leverage is involved in another
way, as well, because the ideas in question came from a tiny design
studio, operating out of a single office room on West 23rd Street
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Masamichi Udagawa, who was born in Tokyo, and Sigi Moeslinger,
who was born in Ried, a small town in Austria, are the principal,
and thus far only employees of Antenna Design. Young and rather
elegant, both cut their teeth in the San Francisco office of Ideo,
among the best-known international design studios. For several
years, Udagawa was Ideo's East Coast representative. It was in that
capacity that he submitted the winning bid for the job of
redesigning the exterior and the software interface of the
MetroCard vending machine in 1996, and he continued the work after
he struck out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   The machine itself, manufactured by the Cubic Automated Revenue
Collection Group of San Diego, is built like a proverbial tank, and
its high-tech innards include the Holy Grail of vending machines, a
precision Swiss bill acceptor that actually takes your ones, tens,
twenties and fifties, and will do so many thousands of times before
jamming.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem, said Nuri Hamidi, the Metropolitan Transit
Authority manager for the project, was that the machine that Cubic
delivered looked like a refrigerator. The authority tried it out on
eight focus groups of riders from different income, ethnic,
language groups and those with disabilities, and the response was
uniformly negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the groups said the box was intimidating,'' Udagawa said.
``The layout of the front was incomprehensible to them, scary
looking, and nobody wanted to touch it. Even after telling people
to hit a certain button, they wouldn't proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Udagawa, then working with Ideo, began his redesign project with
two computer screens. ``There are two ways to create a
transaction,'' he said. ``There is the soda machine. You stick in
some money and choose a product. And there is the store. You choose
an article or service, then you pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that people unanimously liked the store experience,''
he said. ``They didn't like paying first, because then they felt
they were risking something.''
</P>
<P>
   Focus group participants were also confused by the machine's
layout; the Antenna solution was to group the machine's functions
by affixing colored ceramic medallions, or bezels. With the
encouragement of Sandra Bloodworth, the director of the Arts for
Transit program, which supervises the installation of art in the
subways and oversees the overall use of color in the stations, the
bezels were made bright blue, yellow, red and green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used bright colors to make it a little more Coney
Islandish,'' Udagawa said. ``It's pretty dark down there and subway
riders need something to cheer them up, like kindergarten colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting mirrors were also installed, so people could see
behind them and feel more secure.
</P>
<P>
   The symbols and words people read on the machine's screen were
made simple enough for a child to use. An animated hand, index
finger extended, repeatedly pushes a fake button on the touch
screen, which says ``Touch Start.'' ( Moeslinger's first
contribution to the project was to make the finger really big.)
Only one choice on how to proceed may be made on each screen, and
the previous choice sits at the top of the screen, so you can go
back to it if you think you made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The screens themselves use colors coded to the area on the
machine where you have to go next. Green on the screen means cash,
which means go to the green bezel area to insert your money. Yellow
means put in or take out your yellow MetroCard at the yellow bezel,
while credit cards are blue, and receipts get a rather jazzy
flamingo red. In addition, all of this can be done in eight
languages and Braille. Riders with personal stereo headphones can
plug them into a jack and get audio instructions.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 machines are now in service, with around 1,200
full-size and 600 smaller ones still to come. They have proved so
successful that Metro-North and the Long Island Railroad are also
installing similar ones. Ultimately, it is expected that these
vending machines will allow the subway to dispense with token
clerks, who will be transferred into other positions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Based on the success of this project, the New York City Transit
Authority retained Antenna Design to create the interior and
exterior of its next two subway car models, which are now being
tested. Some 1,080 have been ordered, for just under $1.5 billion;
riders will begin seeing them this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the designers have brought along their sense of
color, space and humor to an environment short on all three. ``For
the exterior, mainly we gave the train a nose,'' Moeslinger said.
``We tried to make it more like a face, a bit more
anthropomorphic.'' The front and back of the new cars bear a
resemblance to stylized jack-o'-lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   On the inside, Antenna removed the floor-to-ceiling pole in the
middle of each car, which leaves more room to maneuver a wheelchair
and opens up the space. Computerized ``strip'' maps running along
each side near the roof line indicate the train's progress with a
small light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to make the car as light as possible,'' Udagawa said.
``We chose a much lighter color than usual for the walls _ red dots
on a very light background made of melamine.'' (The material is a
highly scratch-resistant synthetic.) Seats are purplish gray, the
floor, black with burgundy speckles. The seat is mounted on the
wall and cantilevered out, with nothing underneath, but is
surrounded by continuous stainless-steel tubing, the bars and
handles for the riders. If you enter this train, it feels more
spacious and less industrial than the old ones, though the physical
envelope has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   To Antenna Design, all this fastidiousness has a significance,
and an intention, beyond a craftsman's attention to detail. Design
has a lot to do with peoples' behavior, Moeslinger said. ``It's a
way to guide them, by creating positive motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Udagawa agreed, saying, ``Instead of making a law and enforcing
it, which is a brutal way to direct people, design can help achieve
similar effect, not by force of prohibition, but by encouraging
certain behaviors.'' The ultimate goal, Moeslinger said, was to
create environments in which people feel happier and less hostile.

SILLY SIDE OF CELL PHONES: GAMES FOR THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
(jt) 
 By LISA GUERNSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cell phone users certainly seem to be busy. Why would they walk
down the street deep in conversation unless they didn't have the
time to sit down to make a call? They grab their phones the minute
they walk off airplanes because standing at a pay phone takes those
few extra minutes they just don't have.
</P>
<P>
   But they are apparently not quite busy enough. At least some
cell phones now come with games.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one called Snake _ a game that features a a hungry
snake roaming the screen in search of food. Actually, given the
screen's quality, the snake is nothing more than a thick black line
on a pea-green background. But by pressing buttons on the phone's
keypad, you can move that black line up, down and sideways. The
result is something of an awkward slither, at right angles.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the game, which is available on any Nokia phone in
the 5100 or higher series, is to move the slithering snake toward
morsels of food while avoiding the imaginary electric fence that
runs around the boundary of the screen. Bits of food (little dots)
appear in random areas on the screen, and they are gobbled as soon
as the snake passes over them. The more the critter eats, the more
points you rack up.
</P>
<P>
   The snake also grows with each bite, making it increasingly
difficult to move his elongating body without accidentally eating
his tail _ a mistake that ends the game. Another hazard is that
electric fence. If Snake so much as touches it, he is zapped. Game
over.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is nearly as simple as Pong's, and about as
graphically sophisticated. But for someone with time to waste, it
fills the void. Within seconds, a person can become engrossed in
satiating the appetite of this little black line, so long as no one
calls to interrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Snake is not the only time waster on the Nokia phones. (Others
include Logic and Memory, a game that can also be played with a
deck of cards.) And Nokia is not the only company to stock its
phones with games. In fact, games are starting to become a standard
feature on mobile phones, competing in some ways with similar games
on those other wireless gadgets, personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nintendo announced last fall that it was forming a new
company with the popular game developer Konami to develop software
that will let Game Boys use cell phones to download new games from
the Web. Nintendo plans to release the software first in Japan.
``The days when costly, movielike, realistic video game software
attracted attention have gone,'' Nintendo's president, Hiroshi
Yamauchi, said at a news conference last September. ``People now
want simpler games.''
</P>
<P>
   Makers of advanced video-game software might take issue with
that statement. But simpler games do have advantages in the world
of handheld gadgets. Screens are small, and battery power is at a
premium. Besides, people using cell phones are usually going
somewhere. They are busy people, remember? They don't have time to
get deeply involved in a virtual swashbuckling adventure. Something
the equivalent of crossword puzzles for the solo traveler will do
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the other phones that offer games are made by companies
in Europe and are not yet available in the United States. One is
Benefon, a Finnish company that has put Tetris on its phones in an
attempt to attract fans of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Snake, too, seems to have a following. More than 137,000 people
have registered to show off their Snake skills on a Web site set up
by Nokia for a marketing drive in Europe and Asia last year. At
last check, the person holding the highest score was Ozan Esen,
from Turkey, with 369 points. The snake in that game must have been
one long and well-fed reptile. Other top scorers on the site
(www.nokia.com/snake) were also outside the United States, in
nations like Singapore and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   But Warren Schulz, marketing manager for Nokia, expects that
Americans will not be far behind. This summer, he said, Nokia will
promote the games that will be included on phones in the 7100
series, which should be available in the United States in a few
months. One offering will be Snake II, a version with more electric
fences in more inconvenient places. In another game, Rotation,
numbers are moved on screen until they line up in order. ``It's
like the Rubik's Cube,'' Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
   (Schulz, who is an avid Snake player with a high score of 300,
has two tips for Snake players: Use both hands to press the
buttons, and move the snake in a wide circle so it doesn't chomp on
its tail.)
</P>
<P>
   Nokia is now looking into how games can be further integrated
into phones so two people thousands of miles apart can compete.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward games in wireless phones is growing, Schulz
said. ``Right now, it's not the primary driver of why you buy the
phone,'' he added. ``But in some markets it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises a point that one would hope is too ridiculous to
worry about: Could these games become yet another distraction for
people who use their phones while they drive? The possibility has
already generated discussion on the tech-oriented Web site
Slashdot.org (www.slashdot.org). ``Great,'' one person wrote in an
online posting. ``So now the jerk cutting me off in traffic because
he is on his cell phone might be just playing a game!''

 &HT;    HOUSE REPORT FOCUSES ON FAMILY FACTORS IN YOUTH VIOLENCE
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The best way to deter youth violence is to focus on
family factors such as good parenting and the mental health of
children, according to a bipartisan congressional report being
released Thursday(cq).
</P>
<P>
   ``The family unit is really where it starts,'' said Rep. Bob
Etheridge, D-N.C., one of 22 members of a House group that studied
youth violence last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems come to schools ... in a lot of cases from
dysfunctional homes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group was appointed after several shootings last year,
including the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton and others have focused on stricter
gun-control measures to reduce school violence, the report
recommends teaching parenting skills as they were previously taught
in home economics and personal health classes.
</P>
<P>
   It also advises creating a parenting television channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fishing channels, shopping channels, home repair
channels, old movie channels, science fiction channels ...but there
are no parenting channels,'' the report says. ``Arguably, the
information most important and precious to society cannot be found
on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge said the group agreed not to address gun control in
their research, instead focusing on other aspects of youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a broader issue,'' he said. ``This document is about
creating good citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge, a former superintendent of North Carolina schools,
said one of its recommendations has already proven effective in his
state _ character education programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It absolutely is working. You have discipline problems going
down. You have academics going up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report advises block grant funding for character programs
that teach subjects such as honesty, citizenship, courage, justice,
respect and personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers, who span the ideological spectrum in the House
from Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., to Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas,
also examined media violence.
</P>
<P>
   On this front, they recommended ``encouraging'' video game
producers to make ``trailers'' for violent games to remind users
that violence in the real world has consequences. In addition, the
report favors the Motion Picture Association of America's efforts
to create videos and other materials to ``teach basic values that
are shared by all religions as well as secular philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also puts a high priority on increasing mental health
services to help children and teenagers work through depression and
aggression. It advises juvenile justice officials to provide mental
health screenings for every young person entering the system.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1993 Justice Department study, 73 percent of
juveniles in the system reported mental health problems and 57
percent reported past treatment, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report is being released at a Capitol Hill news conference
Thursday. A copy was provided to Cox Newspapers this week.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also recommend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing grants to state and local education agencies to
recruit, train and hire high school-based counselors, psychologists
and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Launching a national public health campaign to raise awareness
of the importance of raising healthy children and the key role of
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Continuing mental health services for juvenile offenders while
on probation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing grants to state and local agencies for case
management and information-sharing efforts between jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing more money for programs that bring police officers
into schools as mentors and instructors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helping educate parents about the existing rating systems for
video games and television, including teaching them to use the
V-chip, which can screen out certain TV programs. This information
should be available in Spanish and other languages, the report
says.

COMPUTER FORENSICS TEAMS LEARN TO FOLLOW DIGITAL FOOTPRINTS

   Dr. John Leeson smiles as he straightens out a paper clip and
inserts it in the back of a portable Zip disk drive of a personal
computer that he has put into standby mode. The disk, which
contains an unknown password that allows access to the computer's
hard drive, pops out and Leeson inserts another disk.
</P>
<P>
   When prompted by an on-screen message, he chooses ``remove
protection'' and enters a new password that will give him access to
valuable information on the hard drive that had previously been
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   That is just part of a bag of tricks _ some easily available on
the Internet _ that Leeson uses to teach his class of police
officers and lawyers ways to retrieve information from computers.
</P>
<P>
   Leeson, 55, an associate professor at the School of Computer
Science at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, is a
teacher and practitioner of what is known as computer forensics. In
addition to teaching, he also helps the campus police department
and the local sheriff's office with computer-related
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is one of a couple of pioneers in this area,'' said Mark
Politt, unit chief of the computer forensics laboratory at the
Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington. ``The need for
computer forensics is growing exponentially, and we need more
people trained in the basic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of computers both as tools and storage devices for
crimes is growing. Investigators need to build up teams because
things have become so complex, one person doesn't have all the
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a great demand for more law enforcement investigators
trained in digital crime-solving techniques, said Carrie Whitcomb,
director of the National Center for Forensics at the University of
Central Florida, and the university is developing a graduate
certificate program. Leeson's course, which is offered in the
summer, is part of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Digital evidence can come from many sources in addition to PCs,
Leeson said. Investigators can also find evidence in Palm devices,
fax machines, cell phones and other equipment that keeps or
produces data or a record of users' activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you catch a criminal?'' Leeson asked. ``You try to
follow the digital trail, just like the gumshoe would follow the
trail of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In a criminal case, if a computer can be seized by law
enforcement authorities, then time is on the side of the
investigators as they peel off the necessary information: e-mail
and Web site records and hard drive data. If a computer cannot be
confiscated, tracking a suspect becomes more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital is like footprints in the sand,'' Leeson said, ``and
it will disappear rather quickly over time because information is
being overwritten constantly. If you overwrite in the digital
world, it is virtually impossible to recover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Standard detective work may be all that is necessary to recover
things like Web site passwords. ``People leave information lying
around,'' Leeson said. Often, a sticky note with a password might
be in an obvious place, like on the PC monitor or underneath the
keyboard. Pictures of a pet, grandparents or a friend, if they can
be identified, may all be clues to a password.
</P>
<P>
   A typical investigation might involve tracing the electronic
path of someone suspected of downloading child pornography. If
certain images are hidden or encrypted, Leeson said, ``it adds
another layer to the hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   If a suspect has used a ``very good encryption program, it goes
from difficult to virtually impossible to unscramble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hypothetical cases he discusses with his students is
that of someone who receives a pipe bomb in the mail. In this case,
an estranged wife is suspected. After the authorities get a search
warrant, the hard disk on her computer reveals that she has been
surfing the Internet and visiting sites that explain how to make
the kind of bomb used in the crime. That kind of evidence, though
circumstantial, can help link a person to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   There are other, tougher cases, Leeson said, particularly those
involving hackers who have used others' computer systems to do
their damage. In those cases, he said, the investigator has to
backtrack to determine how the hacker got into other people's
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Often that entry is through the Internet. ``The World Wide Web
was not designed with security in mind but was designed to share
research,'' Leeson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Web also has features that can aid a forensic computer
scientist. Once a user is online, search engines are logging ``the
fact that you are there and where you are coming from, and those
log records can be used to track their way back,'' Leeson said.
Cookies, tiny data files automatically placed by some sites on a
computer's hard drive with a unique tracking number, are another
way that a user's Web surfing habits are tracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible to falsify your tracks, and that makes the job
of finding you much more difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leeson acknowledges that some of what he taught in his first
introductory graduate course on computer forensics may be old hat
when he teaches the popular class again this summer. For one thing,
Windows 2000 may pose some new security issues, while new state
laws may have been enacted that will have an impact on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any crime that you can conceive of,'' Leeson said, ``a
computer can be an instrument of that crime.''

<P>
   Before frequent flier miles, there were S&AMP;H green stamps. Before
credit-card rewards programs, there were S&AMP;H green stamps. Before
Web dollars, e-coupons and MyPoints.com, there were S&AMP;H green
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   And now, green stamps are back, this time in digital form. S&AMP;H
recently went online with an Internet site, Greenpoints.com, in an
effort to resurrect one of the most famous icons of 20th-century
retailing as a reward for online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for S&AMP;H will be to persuade online users that a
new digital currency called greenpoints _ which you can't see or
hold or lick or print out _ is as meaningful as a stack of
perforated green stamps that would accumulate in an old red Pyrex
bowl on the kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who have not thought of S&AMP;H stamps since your
mother redeemed them for a new blender, let me refresh your memory.
At the peak of trading stamp popularity in the mid-1960s, most gas
stations and supermarkets were offering them to shoppers. S&AMP;H
operated 800 free-standing redemption centers nationwide, and in
the mid-1960s it printed more stamps than the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Each stamp had a pale green background embellished by a jaunty
red ``S&AMP;H'' logo, a serial number and fine print that read ``Value
1 2/3 mills,'' which meant that you could redeem it for cash.
</P>
<P>
   But when I was a child, nobody I knew would have considered
trading green stamps for mere money; they were worth far more than
that. For my family _ sitting around the kitchen table for hours,
licking that tapioca-flavored glue and filling Quick Saver Books
until the pages began to warp and sag under the weight of wet
stamps _ the experience provided the opportunity to ask the big
questions: Were we the sort of people who would redeem our hoarded
stamps for the kinds of sensible items that you could really build
a postwar lifestyle around, like a 12-cup coffee percolator or a
toaster? Or would we blow everything on something frivolous, like
that family down the block who redeemed their stamps for a
basketball that their kids lost the next day?
</P>
<P>
   Green stamps confirmed us as proud members of the first
generation that succumbed to the heady lure of fancy new
appliances. ``That was the year,'' my mother said, remembering one
green stamp purchase in 1969, ``that we upgraded from a two-slice
to a four-slice.'' And toast never tasted so good.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the popularity of green stamps waned in the 1970s,
the S&AMP;H logo still exerts a powerful, Proustian pull on nearly
everyone who was old enough back then to lick. ``The most
compelling thing about S&AMP;H green stamps,'' said Melissa Shore, an
analyst at Jupiter Communications, ``is that whenever I tell
someone that the company is entering the online market, people
immediately launch into an emotional story about their experience
of growing up with S&AMP;H green stamps. They have strong brand equity
and a hundred years of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is understandable that S&AMP;H wants to repackage the
old-fashioned appeal of green stamps into something the company's
executives describe with straight faces as a ``complete loyalty
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company founded in 1896,'' said Walter Beinecke, the
executive vice president of Greenpoints.com and a great-grandson of
an S&AMP;H founder, Thomas Sperry. ``But we're also a 104-year-old
dot-com startup.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers, however, do not come loaded with a sense of taste, at
least not yet. Clicking on a Web site seems a poor substitute for
giddy feelings that the original stamps induced in millions of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: can you convey, online, that emotional
feeling that people remember?'' Shore said. It is a question that
could be asked of any old-style retailer poised to take its
business to the Web. S&AMP;H has a few additional hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents remembered the Depression and the war, and
collecting trading stamps was all part of the dream of affluence,
which meant acquiring your Levitt home and your television and your
first appliances,'' said David Monod, a historian and the author of
``Store Wars: Shopkeepers and the Culture of Mass Marketing,
1890-1939.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely had to do with the physical feeling of the stamp
itself, and the fact that your whole family sat around the table
doing it together.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition to the Web becomes even more problematic because
the domain name Greenstamps.com belongs to two California lawyers,
Sullwold &AMP; Hughes, who think of themselves as S&AMP;H, too, and say
they will not give up the name.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenpoints officials said the name would have been too
old-fashioned for them. ``We would not want to be green stamps on
the Internet anyway, because that speaks to an older way of doing
things,'' Beinecke said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1896, Beinecke said, Sperry &AMP; Hutchinson became the the first
independent trading stamp company to distribute stamps and books to
merchants, beginning in Michigan, and by the turn of the century,
trading stamps were very popular.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Beinecke said, was that the S&AMP;H incentive program
rewarded shoppers both for timely payment (the stamps were given
out in exchange for cash purchases) and loyalty to specific
merchants.
</P>
<P>
   But after the First World War, ``the novelty wore off and nobody
used them,'' Monod said. ``Trading stamps tended to be popular in
inflationary times, when people were concerned about prices, but in
the 1920s, prices were stable. And in the 1930s, prices were
deflationary.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, to protect independent merchants from chain
stores, states began passing fair-trade laws to prevent retailers
from cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers had to find ways to entice customers and give them
price breaks,'' said Sandra Stringer Vance, a historian who
specializes in retail history since World War II and a co-author of
``Wal-Mart: A History of Sam Walton's Retail Phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of trading stamps revived, and by the middle of
the century, S&AMP;H had become a powerful national company whose
success was imitated by scores of local companies with names like
Gold Bond, Blue Chip and Plaid Stamps, said Jeff R. Lonto, a
Minneapolis author who published ``The Trading Stamp Story.''
</P>
<P>
   But the climate changed drastically during the oil embargo in
1973-1974. ``At that time, 40,000 gas stations were giving out
green stamps, but a number of them went out of business or
consolidated,'' Beinecke said.
</P>
<P>
   The trading stamp craze quickly faded. Although S&AMP;H never
stopped the program _ even today about 400 independent businesses,
including gas stations and travel agents, give out stamps and the
company still operates a central customer service center in Atlanta
_ green stamps disappeared from the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Beinecke's family sold the company in 1981, but last year he led
a group of investors who bought S&AMP;H in the hope of re-inventing the
incentive program in a digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than licking and sticking stamps as a family,'' said
Rod Parker, president of Greenpoints.com, ``today's family will go
to the Web site and see how many points they have and what they can
get, and think, `Wow, this can be rewarding.' It's today's culture.
It's fast, it's simple and you never have to leave the house.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you persuade people to abandon the physical sensation
of holding and licking a stamp? This is the same question that
E-Stamp Corp. confronted after beginning to sell digital stamps
online last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that in the consumer market, people were tied to the
physical stamp,'' said Nicole Eagan, E-Stamp's senior vice
president for sales and marketing, ``and we actually bridge the
electronic and physical worlds, because you can buy the stamps in
the e-commerce world but then you can still print them out.'' You
can print it on Avery labels and peel it off and stick it on the
envelope, or you can print it right on the envelope, or you can
print it on a document to show through a window envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Postage, of course, is very palpable: you need it to mail in the
bills. But the points and coupons behind Greenpoints.com and a
number of other online incentive programs that arrived on the
Internet months ago _ like MyPoints.com, ClickRewards.com and
FreeRide.com _ are less tangible.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpoints.com will also offer shoppers offline opportunities
to earn points, said Parker. One merchant, the Foodtown supermarket
chain, is started the program in 10 stores in the New York
metropolitan area. Shoppers keep track of their points with a card
that looks like a credit card, Parker said, and will be able to
redeem both offline and online greenpoints for rewards.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, the programs have to offer rewards that
today's jaded shoppers really believe are worth earning. Airline
mileage? Yes. The opportunity to donate your accumulated points to
charity? Maybe. Toasters? No.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 300 rewards that you could earn when Greenpoints.com
began last week (the list keeps growing, and the company plans to
offer more than 1,000 rewards online by the end of March) were
easy-to-earn items _ like a movie theater ticket (2,400 points) or
five $1 gift certificates for Wendy's fast food (2,400 points). But
so what if you can accumulate enough points to redeem those items
very quickly? You earn 20 greenpoints for each dollar spent. Does
that really feel like a reward to today's shoppers?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are wild consumers these days, but we're desensitized to it
because we buy so much,'' Monod said. ``The things that excite
people today are terribly, terribly expensive, like travel, which
most people consider a luxury, or a new stereo system.''
</P>
<P>
   If you manage to accumulate more than 100,000 greenpoints, you
could get something of real value, like a 13-inch Panasonic color
television (141,600), a travel certificate for a round-trip
domestic flight on Continental Airlines (149,000) or a ski vacation
in Canada (249,000).
</P>
<P>
   But at the introductory rate of 20 points per dollar, you would
have to spend $12,450 to get the ski vacation. Knowing that, would
you be willing to sign up, provide personal information and use the
Greenpoints.com home page as a shopping trip starting point so the
company can keep track of your purchases?
</P>
<P>
   I did. I visited www.greenpoints.com _ and was momentarily
catapulted into the lost world of a particular spring morning in
1969, the year that 80 percent of American households were
collecting trading stamps and a trip to the redemption center in
the next town meant that my mother first had to wrestle my little
brother into ``good clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing up _ giving my e-mail address _ earned me 3,000 points.
I got an additional 1,000 points for providing personal information
like name, sex and number of people in my household, and 500 more
by answering a survey question.
</P>
<P>
   With that many points in the bank, I surveyed some of the
possible purchases, many of which were not on any shopper's wish
list: I'm thinking, for example, of the potpourri to ``add soft
fragrance to any room'' (3,600 points). I decided to hold on to my
points. Instead, I scanned the list of 61 partner merchants (as of
this week, the number of merchants had increased to 88), which
included well-known retailers like OfficeMax.com, Borders.com and
LandsEnd.com.
</P>
<P>
   I had been planning to buy children's bathing suits anyway, and
when I clicked on LandsEnd.com, a second browser window appeared on
the screen to take me there. I bought eight bathing suits for $170,
and when I closed the second browser window I found myself back at
Greenpoints.com, which according to my calculations now owed me
3,400 greenpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Even after my points are credited _ I am still awaiting
confirmation _ my 7,900 total will not be enough to get anything I
want. Neither the Dr. Talking Clock (7,200 points) nor the rugged
50-foot garden hose (7,200) nor anything else in that range really
appealed to me.
</P>
<P>
   I would not mind earning a free airline ticket, and I might not
even lose interest before I bought the necessary 372 bathing suits
_ or their equivalents. Now, if Greenpoints.com wanted to send me
the equivalent value in actual stamps, I would stay up all night,
licking their backs and laboriously pasting them into books.
</P>
<P>
   But then, I'm sentimental.

OSCAR BALLOTS MISROUTED, BUT SHOW WILL GO ON

<P>
   The motion picture academy says some of those missing Oscar
ballots were found Tuesday making their way erroneously through the
slow-motion third-class mail system.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's is going postal over the mistake, but the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has extended the voting deadline
until March 23 because of the snafu.
</P>
<P>
   Academy spokesman John Pavlik said about 1,100 of the 4,200
wayward envelopes were found, and it's possible the rest are on
their way to recipients.
</P>
<P>
   However, California Oscar voters are being instructed to use the
reissued ballots with yellow return envelopes instead of the
originals with white envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles postmaster Kerry Wolny personally picked up the new
mailing Tuesday evening to ensure its proper first-class handling.
And, in keeping with the tradition of pre-Oscar hype, that handoff
was yet another photo opportunity announced with a news release.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the biggest Oscar-related concerns for academy
officials have been preventing vote tampering and keeping the
winners' names a sacred secret until the envelopes are torn open
during the big show.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems they'll be sweating over whether the postal service
will pull through.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that tallies the
ballots, is bracing for a crunch because of the deadline extension.
But Pavlik said the accountants are asking voters to try to get
their ballots back by the original date, March 21, hinting that
their confidence in the U.S. mail has been shaken a bit.

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the temperature soared past 80 degrees in Washington,
D.C., shattering the previous record of 77 degrees set in 1921.
While readings hovered at early summer levels across the Middle
Atlantic states Wednesday, an early spring chill gripped the
Northeast coastline where onshore breezes off the still cold ocean
suppressed readings in the 40s and 50s. Thursday, as winds veer to
the southwest, the exceptional warmth will spread to the Northeast
coast with record highs expected in both New York City and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, heavy snow and strong winds will buffet the
northern Great Lakes Thursday as a jet stream disturbance
intercepts a cold and damp flow of air from eastern Canada.
Meanwhile, clouds and spotty showers will form along a cold front
sweeping east through the eastern Great Lakes. Showers are also
possible near the Tennessee and upper Ohio Valleys as the front
undercuts and lifts humid air over the area. Behind the front,
winds from the north will direct colder air into the central Plains
and upper Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Strong high pressure near Georgia will continue to sponsor
unusually warm weather across a large area from the lower
Mississippi Valley to the Southeast and Middle Atlantic coasts as
daytime readings average between 15 and 25 degrees above normal.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will continue over portions of the West Coast
and interior West as several weak disturbances spiral ashore from
the Pacific Ocean. Locally heavy snow will affect the Sierra and
Watsach ranges while spotty rain showers occur in California.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Records Happen &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The temperature record books are being rewritten this week in
many cities from the Midwest to the Northeast as the mercury has
surged into the 70s and 80s. Scores of daily maximum temperature
marks have been established while some spots had their highest
readings so early in the season. Of course, weather anomalies are
constantly occurring across the globe. While the unusual warmth in
the northern United States has occurred where many millions of
people live, countless weather anomalies go unreported because they
happen over sparsely populated land or oceans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Extended Forecast &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sunday _ Low pressure will cross the Eastern States
accompanied by showery rain. Wet snow will fall in northern New
York and New England. Farther west, breezy and cooler weather will
cover the Mississippi Valley. The northern Plains will be chilly
with some flurries. The interior West will be partly cloudy with
near seasonal temperatures. The Southwest will turn drier, but rain
will arrive in the Northwest as a front approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Tuesday _ The Northeast will be rather cool with
variable clouds. Generally dry and seasonal weather will occur near
the Southeast Coast. Weak disturbances will bring flurries to the
Great Lakes while patchy clouds and showers develop in the western
Ohio and southern Mississippi valleys. The Plains will be dry with
milder air returning to northern sections. Unsettled conditions
will linger in the Northwest. The Southwest will be dry.

USING '40S WOOD  _  1540S, THAT IS  _  TO BUILD A BARN

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH EGREMONT, MASS. _ Buying an old English barn seemed like a
good idea at the time. Richard and Stephanie Stern wanted to add a
great room onto their too-small summer cottage in the Berkshires.
They had met an architect through friends who showed them a series
of homes he had designed using dismantled and reassembled
16th-century barns hauled across the Atlantic from England. ``I was
transfixed,'' Stern said, recalling that fateful meeting four years
ago. ``These were beautiful buildings made from gnarled oak with
hand-hewn beams. If we were going to build a room, I thought, why
not do something unusual and wonderful to the eye?''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one barn left, they were told, because the
British government had recently banned the export of historic
buildings. It was said to be a hay barn, built circa 1540, from
Yalding, Kent. It was stored in a warehouse on Long Island. It
could be theirs for $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The couple bought it without hesitation, sight unseen. ``One of
the stupidest things I've ever done,'' said Stern, chuckling at his
own innocence. Four years after purchasing the English ``barn'' _
in fact, just a pile of beams _ Stern can laugh without wincing.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstructed as a three-story dining room-living room and
crisscrossed with ancient beams, it now stands, the room Stern
imagined when he wrote that hefty check. But getting there has not
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sterns bought their cottage, a 1957 ranch sheathed in rough
timber siding, in 1974, shortly after they were married and began
careers as journalists. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom house was
fronted by a homely two-car garage. But the Sterns loved the place,
which sits on the grounds of an old estate. They had mountain views
and could see deer grazing in the fields below. In 1988, they added
a second floor to the house. It was a budget job that barely
allowed two more bedrooms and two more baths. ``We had plenty of
room for guests,'' said Stern, ``but nowhere to entertain them. The
living room was tiny, we ate on a narrow, enclosed porch, and the
kitchen was pitiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvements were put on hold while Stern changed careers. She
attended business school and, together with her husband, launched a
company that specializes in investor relations and corporate
communications. It has been very successful. With 20 employees, the
former journalists have become enthusiastic capitalists. ``Us, of
all people,'' Stern said. ``I mean, we had a peace sign on our
wedding cake.''
</P>
<P>
   They bought an additional 3 and a half acres next to their house
and prepared to add the new wing. The trouble started when they
bought the barn and put their architect's plans out to bid.
``Contractors said the blueprints weren't sufficiently detailed,''
Stern said. ``No one was willing to give us a estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling they had been snookered into buying a bunch of old beams
that could not be pieced together, they fired the architect and
went looking for someone who could build their dream room. They
found the right guy, John James, just down the road in Sheffield,
Mass. A Harvard-trained architect and a former professor at the
Columbia University School of Architecture, James had his own
design firm in New York City before relocating to the Berkshires in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sterns brought him their problem in the summer of 1997,
he was flabbergasted. ``Sixty-thousand dollars for a pile of wood
they'd never seen?,'' he said. ``For $20,000, I could pick up the
phone today and find you an American barn and that includes
delivery and assembly on your foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, James admitted, there is beauty in old beams. ``The
English didn't have the abundance of wood that was later available
in the American colonies,'' he said. ``Their barns were made from
whatever scrap hardwoods they could find, mostly oak _ old masts,
twisted beams that a colonial builder would have rejected. As a
result, some of the pieces are almost sculptural.'' James
acknowledges that the Sterns paid $40,000 extra to buy a barn so
old, Shakespeare could have slept in it.
</P>
<P>
   Initially reluctant to join the misbegotten project, James was
nonetheless intrigued. He suggested he and Stern visit the barn
where it was being stored, on Long Island. They found it outdoors,
not inside as they had been told. With a drawing in hand that
showed positions for the numbered pieces, James examined the pile.
Some pieces were missing and others had no numbers, but James
announced that the job could be done.
</P>
<P>
   But there were more challenges ahead. Because the Sterns'
property was on a hillside, the barn foundation had to be dug into
a slope. The old garage had to be dismantled to make way for a new
kitchen. So James proposed turning the new basement into a garage _
one that could hold four cars and Stern's collection of
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Insulation was another problem. The posts and beams of the barn
would be exposed inside the house, so insulation would have to be
applied on the outside. With newer barns, James had used
prefabricated panels on the exterior to enclose the insulation. But
he was worried that they might be too heavy for the old structure.
To be safe, he reinforced the roof and created a frame around the
old timber.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge, James said, was figuring out how to
attach a huge building to a little ranch house without making it
look like ``a whale attached to a sardine.'' Initial plans had
linked the two directly. James decided to add an intermediate piece
_ a silo shape _ that would hold the stairs. There was also space
for a loft and a fifth bedroom over the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Stern particularly loves the loft, which gives him a grand view
of his timbers. Since the barn's windows face north, James added
two south-facing dormers to bring light into the room. Outside, the
dormers break up the vast expanse of roof; inside they illuminate
the beams, which pass in front of the dormers.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time to decorate.
</P>
<P>
   An old friend, the designer Patricia Hart McMillan, suggested
they paint the plasterboard walls of the barn a pale yellow-green
to complement the oak beams. McMillan, who wrote ``Home Decorating
for Dummies,'' had two goals, she said: providing comfort and
saving money. ``They'd already spent so much on the building,'' she
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   So McMillan went bargain-hunting. She found kitchen cabinets at
Home Depot and bought rugs at discount. Ten dining room chairs were
$600 at a tag sale.
</P>
<P>
   At an Asian import store in Great Barrington, McMillan found a
round, marble-topped dining table that seats 12 and the top of an
ox cart that she converted into a coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   The Sterns are delighted. ``Better than I ever imagined,'' said
Stern, who feels ``like we dodged a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The final cost, he said, was $600,000, including furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue that the Sterns could have bought a new house
and quite a bit of land for that kind of money. But that is not the
point. The Sterns have got their 16th-century barn, and they love
it.

ROD LURIE GOES FROM CRITIC TO FILMMAKER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Rod Lurie first blew into Los Angeles about a decade ago,
the local critical community was not quite sure what to make of
him.
</P>
<P>
   The brash New Yorker, who reviewed films in a funny,
conversational way for Los Angeles Magazine and later on KABC-AM
(790), did not follow the unwritten protocol of critics. Lurie
would make purposely outlandish statements (which got him banned
from at least one major studio's screenings). He fetishized the
Academy Awards to an unseemly extent (and was thanked by name from
the Oscar stage by such winners as Mel Gibson, James Cameron and
Martin Landau). And he'd talk constantly about this film or that
movie that he was on the verge of making himself _ like that was
ever really going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   But it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deterrence,'' Lurie's first feature as a writer-director,
opens Friday in L.A. His second film, ``The Contender,'' is in
post-production. He has successfully made the transition that
barely a handful of American critics (Peter Bogdanovich and Paul
Schrader being the most prominent) has pulled off.
</P>
<P>
   So his ego, which was never mistaken for small, should be
elephantine by now. But strangely, if logically, Lurie the
filmmaker is as becomingly self-effacing as his opinionated
previous incarnation aggressively sought attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, at some point, every entertainment journalist has the
fantasy of being on the other side,'' says Lurie, a fleshy,
unfailingly polite and engaging raconteur. ``But this is really
humbling, and I can't tell you how profoundly true that is. I don't
think, frankly, that I was a very good film critic. I think that I
was a very entertaining film critic, but when I would read pieces
by just about any significant newspaper or magazine critic, they
would be so much more profound and well-written than anything I had
done that I really came to respect those people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now these people are going to be seeing my film and ...
Look, I've had a lot of tension in my life. I went to West Point,
which is an intense place. As I was trying to make `Deterrence' and
other films, I lost my house. But the most tense time I ever had
was waiting to read that first review of my picture at the Cannes
Film Festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was generally laudatory, in case you were wondering. A
taut, single-set political thriller that Lurie freely admits
commits ``grand theft larceny'' from the nuclear brinksmanship
classic ``Fail Safe,'' ``Deterrence'' stars Kevin Pollak as a
near-future U.S. president trying to manage a sudden, Middle East
military crisis from a snowbound Colorado diner. Timothy Hutton and
Sheryl Lee Ralph play his emphatically contradictory advisers, and
a dozen-odd civilians and Secret Service agents are also in
continuous, frantic, chatty motion around the cramped space. The
movie steadily builds end-of-the-world suspense while reams of
complex military, geopolitical and ethical data are discussed.
</P>
<P>
   For Lurie poker pal Pollak (``The Usual Suspects,'' ``A Few Good
Men,'' ``The Whole Nine Yards''), there was both confidence and
pleasant surprise in the skills his friend brought to the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times has Rod told you he shot the movie in just 18
days?'' Pollak says, unable to resist busting his buddy. ``He's a
very gifted writer, and I had read his screenplays before and
enjoyed them. But I was surprised that he had sort of a natural
gift for leadership, which of course, is necessary for this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems natural enough. Not only was there that West Point
training, but the filmmaker's father, internationally renowned
political cartoonist Ranan Lurie, was an Israeli major who was
instrumental in capturing the West Bank during the Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   But if the critic seemed confident to his actors, they should be
even more impressed by his acting abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how I was going to do it,'' Lurie admits. ``I'd
made a short film before this one, but there was so much I had no
clue about _ set language, coaxing actors _ it was funny, but it
was embarrassing. You do pick it up as you go along and I did have
everything pre-edited in my head, but I think my crew was very
worried about me.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lurie had one thing going for him that a lot of first-time
filmmakers don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no other job (besides film criticism) do you have the money
or time to see every movie that comes out,'' Lurie notes. ``And I
had the added advantage of being able to meet with every filmmaker.
Little did they know that I was going to school whenever I was
interviewing Spielberg or someone like him, that I was really
dissecting their brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Lurie freely admits that his entertainment journalism career
was, from the start, a means toward his filmmaking goal. But it was
also his bread-and-butter for many years. The father of two, who
now lives in Pasadena with his wife, Gretchen, passed up several
well-paying critic gigs in the mid-`90s while fruitlessly striving
to get ambitious film projects financed. This led to the house
foreclosure, but also to the shrewd, strategic determination to get
his film career going on as modest a scale as possible
(``Deterrence'' cost well under $1 million).
</P>
<P>
   Now that's really paying off. ``Contender,'' a different kind of
political thriller, boasts 53 different locations and the former
critic's all-time favorite actress, Joan Allen, in the lead role.
Still, Lurie insists that he's made no more than a lateral career
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a step up at all; they're two totally separate
careers,'' he reckons. ``The level of artistry that Pauline Kael
achieved in her field is as high as the level of artistry that
Martin Scorsese has achieved in his field. And really, it's not
even a lateral move for me, because I had achieved a certain level
of influence as a film critic when I went to making a small,
independent film. In a way, it was moving into another career by
downsizing quite a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply different. But I'll tell you one thing: If I
thought that I was not the equal of my peers as a film critic, you
can imagine how I feel as a filmmaker!''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but Rod, they don't give any of your beloved Academy
Awards for film criticism. As long as all your other dreams have
come true, why not hope that, someday, you'll be thanking Mel
Gibson instead of the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got nominated for an Oscar, I would really build an
underground shelter because the apocalypse is coming,'' says Lurie,
bound and determined to remain his own harshest critic. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With forms for the 2000 census scheduled to arrive by mail next
week in most parts of the nation, people may be unaware that for
the first time they will be able to fill out their census
questionnaires on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Census Bureau has embarked upon an advertising
campaign to encourage participation in the nation's decennial head
count, the use of the Internet has remained something of an open
secret within the agency, which has not gone out of its way to
advertise the Internet option.
</P>
<P>
   Edison Gore, assistant division chief for field programs at the
Census Bureau, said census officials prefer that people stick to
the ``tried and proven'' method of pen and paper. ``We know what's
going on there, and it's very controlled. The Internet is something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   That is primarily because census officials, concerned about
security, did not proceed with Internet collection until November
1998. As a result, Gore said, they did not have time to test it as
thoroughly as they would have liked and are uncertain how
successful it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Census forms can be filled out electronically at the bureau's
Web site (www.census.gov), although Gore said that the site is
promoted as an informational tool, not as a means for submitting
data. The icon leading to the on-screen form is at the top of the
page, labeled, alternately, Forms Help or Census 2000, or people
can go directly to the questionnaire site (www.2000.census.gov).
</P>
<P>
   The census sends out two forms _ long and short. Only people
receiving the short form _ with a mere seven questions asking about
things like gender, birthday and race of household members _ will
be able to answer electronically. Nationwide, five out of six
households _ an estimated 100 million out of 120 million _ will get
the short form. A greater proportion of these go out in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining households will receive the long form. It asks
about 34 topics, including languages spoken at home, grandparents
as child-care providers and plumbing facilities in the residence.
Those paper forms must be filled out and mailed back.
</P>
<P>
   People who wish to submit the information electronically will
still need the paper form, each of which contains a bar code with a
22-digit number that must be entered to call up the on-screen
version.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which will operate until April 15, also includes
guidance for completing the form. And if people run into trouble _
for example, if their browser turns out to be incompatible _ the
site suggests they give up and revert to the paper form.
</P>
<P>
   The main census Web site tells all about the census _ from why
people should participate to how they can get temporary census
jobs. Guides can be downloaded in 49 languages.
</P>
<P>
   The site also features all sorts of arcane statistics and
information, so people can see how common their last name is, say,
or search for the latitude and longitude of their ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   The census, which dates from 1790, uses the data to reapportion
congressional seats and to distribute federal money. It
traditionally suffers from a low response rate. In 1990, only
two-thirds of the nation's households returned their forms.
</P>
<P>
   Mail response rates are lowest among urbanites, renters and
minority groups. In the 1990 census, that low response resulted in
an estimated undercount of 3.2 percent for New York, double the
national rate.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say that Internet collection is unlikely to
encourage responses among the poor and other groups that
traditionally do not answer the census. Pat Valle, the bureau's
area manager for Manhattan, said that the electronic version is
``geared toward people who are perhaps very busy but are computer
literate'' and are willing to answer quickly. ``We're not sure we
are going to draw an audience where socioeconomic status is
lower,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For those people who don't respond to the census because of
concerns about confidentiality, the agency emphasizes that personal
census information is, by law, kept private for 72 years. It is
withheld from all government agencies, like the Internal Revenue
Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't share information,'' Gore said. ``We can offer those
same assurances with Internet collection as we do with paper
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau says that information sent to the site over
the Internet is heavily encrypted. Still, transmitting data
electronically adds a layer of concern about security. In fact, the
idea of Internet collection had been around for some time, but
concerns that hackers could break into the system kept officials
from proceeding until 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   There has been growing ``public acceptance of the Internet for
submitting financial data, in terms of tax forms, e-commerce,
giving a credit card number and so forth,'' Gore said, ``so we felt
that it was worthwhile to resurrect this as a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the census conducts a kind of dress rehearsal for
census collection. In 1998, for example, tests were done in three
areas, each presenting a different demographic challenge:
Sacramento, Calif.; 11 counties in South Carolina; and Menominee
County in Wisconsin, home of an Indian reservation. Sacramento was
chosen because of its great racial and ethnic diversity, and the
South Carolina counties because of a large proportion of rural
route and box number addresses. Tests were done at the reservation
because the Census Bureau estimates that American Indians were
undercounted by 12 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say we haven't done testing'' for Internet
collection, Gore said. ``Just not in the context of a dress
rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the Internet will help the census in its
primary goal of boosting the response rate. After Census Day, April
1, an army of temporary enumerators will be dispatched to do a
door-to-door count of those who have not answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly don't know how many people will use this,'' Gore said.
``My guess is that the paper response rate is going to far outweigh
the Internet response.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has another open secret: People can submit
their information by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   An 800 number printed on each census questionnaire connects to
an answering system that gives people assorted options for help and
information. One option allows them to give their census
information to a human operator.

`GOD, THE DEVIL AND BOB' IS IN THE DETAILS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Thursday, March 9; tonight is THURSDAY in
this story. Fact box below.) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Old Testament book of Job, God and the Devil make a
friendly wager over the fate of a good and pious man. God strips
His poor guinea pig of his belongings, offs his sons and covers his
body with boils and sores, just to see if he will still love and
praise God. Job prevails, of course (otherwise, the story probably
wouldn't have made it into the Bible), but you have to wonder how
Job's dead family felt about being treated like mere chattel for
God and Satan's amusement.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone through their respective Old Testament
fire-and-brimstone phases, God and the devil have mellowed a bit,
but they're still placing bets with one another. In ``God, the
Devil and Bob,'' God (who looks like Jerry Garcia but is voiced by
James Garner) and the devil (Alan Cumming) meet at an auto show to
stroll around and admire the new models, and get into their usual
theological bickering. The devil picks out Bob (French Stewart), an
underachieving auto worker trying to pick up some free beer in a
seamy pub, and the game is on: Can Bob (``Not my best work,'' God
sighs) redeem the world, or even himself? At stake: our entire
planet.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not a new premise _ the Bible can't exactly sue for
plagiarism. ``God, the Devil and Bob'' is an often highly amusing
lark that sugar-coats its parody of religious beliefs with some
feel-good secular humanism and an occasional dollop of sentiment.
Visuals are whimsically modest, and the animation is pretty much
what we've come to expect from network TV. Though series creator
Matthew Carlson, himself a former seminary student, treads upon
hallowed ground with a light, and lighthearted, foot, a couple of
TV stations _ including one in Salt Lake City _ have already,
predictably, declared they won't air the series.
</P>
<P>
   God is in the details in this series _ in order to prove to Bob
they are who they say they are, God pulls the old magic trick where
he pulls egg after egg from the mouth of his unamused assistant
Satan. ``Hmmm! How many are in there?'' He marvels to Himself. This
is also a world where UPN has been reconfigured into a cynical
religious network (which couldn't be any worse than it is now), and
in the underworld, Guy Lombardo and his orchestra perpetually
serenade the bummed-out guests with ``Auld Lang Syne.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob's family disregards his portentous announcement as just more
random confused babbling; only his son believes him, since he, too,
can see God. That's part of a deal he cut with the devil, the
Almighty explains _ God has relative control over them until
they're 12, and Satan takes over during the teen years. Turns out
the devil is too successful at corrupting the minds of our youth _
in episode two, the devil dates Bob's daughter to get the poor
guy's goat, but even he finds her callow nattering too repellent to
endure. God observes, ``That's why I never had any girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's pseudo-theological musings are amusing, as well, and
not afraid to address the Big Questions (the Big Answers, on the
other hand, are another matter). Of a rainbow God creates in
episode two, He explains, ``The trick is to inspire wonder without
being heavy-handed, so the atheists won't feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   That line is indicative of ``God, the Devil and Bob's'' deadpan
fun. Its cleverness may be a little too nuanced and low-key for
mainstream audiences _ the show probably belongs on a cable
network, where it would be a programming highlight _ instead of a
broadcaster like NBC. But it's good fun to see our deity and demon
bicker over minutiae while Bob looks on without comprehension. At
one point, Bob grouses to God, ``You're so inscrutable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Creator shrugs. ``I get that a lot.'' &QL;

The show: ``God, the Devil and Bob.'' &QL;

`GOD, THE DEVIL' AND THE JOURNALIST
</HEADLINE>

By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give the people at NBC credit _ in their efforts to draw
audiences, they've pulled in some pretty heavy hitters this past
season. First, they hired the President of the United States to
star in their hit drama ``The West Wing.'' And now, they've
recruited both God and the devil to grace the new animated comedy
``God, the Devil and Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God et al.'' concerns Bob (voiced by French Stewart), a
Detroit Everyshlub who becomes the battleground for a bet between
God (James Garner, naturally) and the devil (Alan Cumming). If Bob
can go against his instincts and bring a modest good to the world,
God wins the wager; if not, the devil wins. More importantly,
mankind loses.
</P>
<P>
   The show, premiering Thursday before taking up residence on
Tuesday nights, was created by Matthew Carlson, a former seminary
student who more recently busied himself with the devil's work _ or
whatever you want to call the failed sitcom ``Men Behaving Badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cumming, who describes his character as a ``snarling brat,''
says of the show, ``I just couldn't believe it was getting made _
it walks a fine line between shocking and hilarious.'' He adds of
co-star Garner, ``He's so funny. His parking space at the studio
reads, `James Garner: God.' So if we do another season, I'm
demanding my parking space read, `Alan Cumming: devil.'''
</P>
<P>
   We secured the ultimate interviews _ with God and the devil _
through their earthly intermediaries, Cumming _ a Tony winner for
``Cabaret,'' who has also played oily types in ``Titus'' and the
remake of ``Annie,'' and stole Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut''
by flirting madly with Tom Cruise _ and Carlson, the series'
Creator's creator.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What drew you to the project?
</P>
<P>
   GOD: I could tell you how much I wanted to try my hand at
comedy, but the truth is, I needed the money.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: I have so many friends already in television that it
seemed a logical progression to star in my own show. I think of
this as a fly-on-the-wall documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you consider your finest accomplishment and,
conversely, your biggest disappointment?
</P>
<P>
   GOD: My finest accomplishment is microwave popcorn. My biggest
disappointment would have to be Buckner missing that ground ball in
the `86 World Series. He asked for an easy grounder, I gave it to
him _ did he want me to catch it for him, too? Now you got me
started again ...
</P>
<P>
   The devil (discretely interrupting): I think my finest
accomplishment would be American television, and, in a funny way,
my biggest disappointment would be American television, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q (to the devil): Do you feel that you're the victim of bad
press? Does God just have better publicists?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: God's always got the higher moral ground, obviously,
because he invented it. I don't think God's got publicists. I have
a slew of publicists, I have many friends in that world.
</P>
<P>
   Q What can you point to as absolute proof that you exist?
</P>
<P>
   GOD: My mailbox. Hey, I'm getting the Pottery Barn catalog _ you
tell me.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: The success of the Backstreet Boys. McDonald's.
Pokemon. Things like that _ get `em while they're young.
</P>
<P>
   Q What's your favorite part of L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: Well, L.A.'s my pride and glory, it's my finest work.
Geographically, it's an earthquake waiting to happen, and of
course, Hollywood was my idea _ and it's working very well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your idea of a perfect date?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: There's a scene in an upcoming episode where there
are nuns fighting, and I say, `Nuns kicking nun butt _ it doesn't
get any better than this.' So watching nuns fight would be a good
date.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Turn-ons?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: In everyone, there's a little bit of a mirror that I
see myself in, so that's a turn-on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Turn-offs?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: Marie Osmond. It switches off pretty quick there.
(Note: God, being God, had the good sense not to participate in
this part of the interview.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you see yourself in five years?
</P>
<P>
   GOD: Running a string of yogurt shops. My friends tell me I
should aim higher.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: At the top. God will have retired by that time, and
I'll have taken over. I think I'd mature into the position but
never lose my inner child.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Favorite TV show?
</P>
<P>
   GOD: ``Maverick,'' for some reason. I couldn't tell you why.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' was a
stroke of genius, and I didn't have to do anything for that to
happen. All the things I think about people came out there. The
rise of the American game show, that occupies my time. I think
Regis was thrown out of heaven about the same time as me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Favorite music?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: Dolly Parton. She's a surprising, yet willing,
disciple. She sends subliminal messages in her music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You two meet at an auto show at the beginning of the series _
what kind of car do you prefer?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: DeLoreans were one of my ideas that didn't quite go
through. I don't like SUVs; anything that's safe I'm not for. But,
of course, they kill other people. That's a really good thing. You
have fewer accidents if you're driving one, but more people die
when they're hit by one. So basically, you have to get one of those
or you're screwed.
</P>
<P>
   Q (to the devil): What did you think about ``Eyes Wide Shut''?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: It was a brave attempt, but obviously it only
scratched the surface. A brave attempt. Good try.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the biggest misperception about you?
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL: The biggest is that heaven is where all the good
people go. All the boring people go to heaven. All the cool people
go to hell.
</P>
<P>
   GOD: I've actually got tiny hands. &QL;

GREAT MUSIC ISN'T NECESSARILY MADE BY GREAT PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A postscript on the Shostakovich month just past and a caution:
You can like the music; you don't have to like the man. Listeners
have a hard time believing this. How, people ask, could the
composer who toadied and cringed before his Soviet bosses have
written such bravely beautiful music? In all those quartets and
symphonies, weren't those secret messages he was sending? Do we
read between the conformist lines and find rebellion?
</P>
<P>
   They weren't. We don't. False syllogisms are at work. One goes
like this: If we admire noble character and admire good music, then
the two belong together. Also, if music makes us feel good in a
noncriminal way, then mustn't that ethical good health originate
with the person who created it? The impulse to join the admirable
with the beautiful is nearly irresistible for most of us, but we
might have to face the fact that Shostakovich was a mediocre human
being possessed of staggering musical ability.
</P>
<P>
   After Stalin scared him almost to death in the mid-1930s, the
composer did his duty: writing patriotic pieces, signing petitions
on request (some of them damaging to his colleagues), rebuking what
he was asked to rebuke, dispensing the government line as directed.
He may not have liked some of it, but there is little evidence that
he showed much hesitation when his own skin was in question.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Shostakovich behaved just as most of us would
have behaved in similar circumstances. Martyrs are few.
Self-preservation is strong. Cowardice is a human concept. Animals
run away without apology when they feel themselves threatened. This
may make them smarter than a lot of us. Shostakovich seems to have
been a fragile personality to begin with. It is a wonder he
survived at all, but he did, and with a comfortable life style far
above that of nobler Soviet citizens around him.
</P>
<P>
   There are other opinions. My colleague James R. Oestreich
reported last season on a Boston musicological conference at which
the great man's personality and history were vehemently debated.
Loud support came from defenders of Solomon Volkov's ``Testimony,''
purporting to detail the composer's unhappiness with his own words.
</P>
<P>
   ``To call Shostakovich a Communist is the ultimate insult,''
said Dmitry Feofanov, a pianist and a lawyer. Richard Taruskin, a
joyously contentious music historian, rose from the audience to
defend his belief that the composer was ``perhaps Soviet Russia's
most loyal musical son.'' Words like fraud were bandied about,
apologies asked for and derisive laughter heard but evidently no
fists thrown.
</P>
<P>
   At a performance of the 11th Symphony by the San Francisco
Symphony at Carnegie Hall in New York not long ago, I was greeted
with program notes offering a description within a description. On
the face of it, the piece is pure patriotism and storytelling. The
subtitle is ``The Year 1905'' and its movements take us through the
events and the emotions of a galvanizing event in pre-Soviet
history. Here peaceful protesters were slaughtered in the streets
of St. Petersburg by Cossack troops. The massacre was a stepping
stone to revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Could we not simply have taken this symphony for what it says
and does? It is full of pictorial sounds, musical gunshots among
them. It also mourns publicly injustices done the masses.
Shostakovich did what a good Soviet with musical talent would be
asked to do. If the piece is not profound in the way of his more
abstract music, it is not supposed to be. I am not the first to
point out that composing relatively superficial pieces was for
Shostakovich not a chore at all. He was good at flag-waving and
populist dumbing-down; he seemed to enjoy the process.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those hidden clues? Especially the date, 1957, a
year after the Hungarian uprising, the one that featured brutal
suppression by Soviet occupiers. Certainly Shostakovich, the brave
dissident, was offering wry commentary on the morals of his masters
by pretending to celebrate their predecessors. What delicious
irony. Certainly this was not propaganda but guerrilla warfare, at
the very least a message in a bottle floated out toward the free
world. ``Shostakovich may seem to be enslaved,'' it reads, ``but in
his covert way he is fighting back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tortured speculation like this is a conclusion looking for
arguments in its behalf. It begins with a need to find that a maker
of beautiful things is also a moral person. Artists are not
necessarily good people at all. Nor does their work necessarily
have anything to with goodness. We all know what a dreadful human
being Wagner was, and yet he opened to us a world of scarcely
fathomable richness. Beethoven was a not a very nice man either,
nor always a scrupulous one. When foreigners asked Haydn for
transcriptions and arrangements, he farmed the work out to pupils
and collected the money himself.
</P>
<P>
   How are we to reconcile the elegance of Herbert von Karajan's
conducting with the slippery politics of his career? The
executioner sighs happily at the sound of ``Vissi d'arte.''
Murderers are capable of feeling the beauty of a Haydn quartet with
the same intensity, penetration and purity as a Benedictine monk.
Weak people write strong music. Bad people write noble music.
</P>
<P>
   For one who has moved through and around one particular artistic
community for many years, the paradox of creative beauty emanating
from the hands of less than well-behaved creators is powerful. I
tend to think the situation is worse in music, but I tell outsiders
about the jealousy, the scheming, the greed and the dishonesty of
so many musicians, and their response is invariably: ``Well, it
couldn't be worse than (dance, writing, art _ you fill in the
blank).
</P>
<P>
   That there are and were musicians as pure as their best work is
of course true. Brahms and his coterie were nastiness incarnate
toward Liszt, who in turn treated them with magnanimity. The wisest
of the good musicians have a hold on their necessarily outsize egos
and are splendid citizens. But it is important to notice that the
two parts of a creative career _ the life lived and the art created
during it _ are not automatically co-dependent.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to call Shostakovich's life tragic, at least any more
tragic than your own. Terrifying and stressful a lot of it was, but
tragedy requires an imposing person brought down by fate and bad
decisions. Shostakovich was more a victim; I don't think he rises
to the needed stature. It is easy to pity his discomfort. Indeed,
the wrenching anguish in so many of his pieces (and this may be
more tortured speculation) is perhaps a composer wondering how much
he really likes himself. Be satisfied with Shostakovich, the great
musician. He doesn't have to be a great man.

 &HT;    PLAN OFFERS DOUBLE-BARRELED RELIEF FOR LONG-TERM CARE COSTS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For two years, President Clinton has sought to help
roughly 2 million American families who need or provide long-term
care by offering them a tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, Republican congressional leaders have suggested
that offering people tax deductions to purchase long-term care
insurance is a better way to address the burgeoning issue.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of lawmakers put the two ideas together
Wednesday and predicted Congress would approve the proposal this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that on this issue we have so much agreement in
Washington,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the
Senate Select Committee on Aging and the second-ranking Republican
on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. ``An aging nation has
no time to waste preparing for long-term care.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-term care now costs the nation about $116 billion a year _
$43 billion spent by individuals and $73 billion by government,
primarily the federal-state Medicaid program. By 2020, the cost is
expected to jump to $207 billion a year, including $82 billion by
individuals and $125 billion by government.
</P>
<P>
   Noting there will be an additional 20 million Americans over age
65 by 2020, Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., also a member of the Finance
Committee, said the bill was needed now ``to begin to prepare for
the time when America will look as Florida does today.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of combining the competing proposals _ a tax credit for
current long-term care users, and a tax deduction for potential
future users _ grew out of a meeting between John Rother,
legislation and policy director of AARP (formerly the American
Association of Retired Persons) and Chip Kahn, president of the
Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA).
</P>
<P>
   For years, AARP has supported the tax credit, which would help
its elderly members, while HIAA has supported the tax deduction as
a way of boosting the long-term care market.
</P>
<P>
   The bill adopts Clinton's proposal for a phased-in, $3,000
non-refundable tax credit for those who purchase or provide
long-term care, either within a community care center or in a
nursing home. A non-refundable tax credit means that if the credit
exceeds a person's tax liability, the government does not refund
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes a phased-in 100 percent annual tax
deduction for long-term care insurance up to a cap of $200 for
people 40 or younger, $375 for those 41 to 50, $750 for those 51 to
60, $2,000 for those 61 to 70, and $2,500 for persons 70 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would help roughly 250,000 Americans under the
age of 18, 500,000 between 18 and 64, and 1.2 million 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are expected to cost the federal government about
$35.4 billion over 10 years. A companion to the Grassley-Graham
bill was filed in the House by Reps. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., and
Karen Thurman, D-Fla., both members of the tax-writing Ways and
Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   An HIAA study predicted the tax deduction would spur a 14 to 24
percent growth in the long-term care market. As of June 1998,
roughly 5.8 million long-term care policies had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of such insurance would reduce state Medicaid
spending on long-term care nationwide by about $3.5 billion a year,
according to the HIAA study.

 Bryan Garner is the author of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage
and is editor in chief of Black's Law Dictionary (seventh
edition).  
 By BRYAN A. GARNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When linguists talk of dialects, they typically refer
exclusively to the spoken word. But the Internet seems to have
created a highly unusual beast: a written dialect in which
punctuation is abandoned, uppercasing is largely unknown (unless
you're shouting), and all sorts of acronyms replace phrases. BTW
means ``by the way,'' IMHO means ``in my humble opinion,'' OTOH
means ``on the other hand,'' w/e means ``whatever'' (in the slangy,
dismissive sense) and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing these shorthand expressions _ and using them _ gives one
a sense of belonging to the group. Yet the dialect does not really
exist except through the written word, and the ``group'' to which
one belongs exists only in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and teachers sometimes ask me whether all this will
affect standard American English. The answer is that it is bound
to, although predicting the effect would be more difficult than
predicting the outcome of the 2004 presidential election. In the
main, though, it appears likely that these aspects of Internet
style _ the punctuationless, generally lowercase style riddled with
acronyms _ will largely remain confined to the Internet. To what
extent children might face greater obstacles in learning to write
what we now know as standard American English is a difficult
question.
</P>
<P>
   People yearn for guidance, though, and the online folks have a
style manual: Three years ago two editors at Wired magazine,
Constance Hale and Jessie Scanlon, produced ``Wired Style,'' which
has just appeared in its second edition. The book is long on
attitude and short on principles: ``Think blunt bursts and sentence
fragments. Writing that is on-the-fly _ even frantic.'' That
immediately raises an interesting question: If that is how writers
are supposed to be thinking, then why would they stop to consult a
style manual? How could they?
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is the question of what guidance they will
find if they do look at the manual. ``Spelling and punctuation are
loose and playful.'' ``Write the way people talk. Don't insist on
`standard' English.'' ``Appreciate unruliness.'' ``Welcome
inconsistency.'' The authors do many of these things themselves.
For example, they seem to welcome inconsistency by using media as a
singular noun on page 13 and as a plural on page 16. Yet on page
115, they seem to endorse the singular.
</P>
<P>
   The authors embrace the jargon of the digerati, and they even
praise the use of jargon. But the discussion stays superficial:
They keep it light and quick, presumably because their readers are
on the fly (or on-the-fly, as the authors incorrectly hyphenate the
phrase).
</P>
<P>
   A certain amount of their advice is sound. Internet English is
surely relaxed and playful and creative. The so-called smileys made
from text characters _ from the commonplace :-) for someone smiling
to more complex emoticons _ show a delightful imagination at work.
And the immediacy of modern communication demands a saving of
keystrokes, however much the old-schoolers will lament the lack of
reflection that often goes into instant messages.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors are stingy with their advice: only a fifth of
the 192-page text is devoted to usage and style. The bulk of the
book is a list of definitions of Internet terms. Even the heavily
dated ones, like WYSIWYG (short for ``what you see is what you
get''), are treated as though they were just as current today as
they were five years ago. There is precious little guidance about
real usage problems.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is understandable. How do you write a usage guide for
the unruly? The answer, judging from this book, is that you don't.
Your doctrine becomes linguistic libertarianism, in which the only
dogmatic judgments you make are to put down the standard
authorities like ``The Chicago Manual of Style'' and Strunk and
White's ``Elements of Style'' while proclaiming on the front and
back covers, and in press material, that your book has attained a
status equal to those classics.
</P>
<P>
   That raises a pervasive ambiguity. The authors do not quite say
whether they mean for their suggestions to apply to all writing in
the digital age or only to Internet writing. Even if their
suggestions are limited only to Internet writing, are Web sites on
the same footing as chat rooms when it comes to rejecting standard
English? Consider again the subtitle: principles for the digital
age, not merely for digital technology. It's a chilling thought.
</P>
<P>
   As a professional usage critic, I mainly wanted to know two
things when I first picked up the book. What do the authors say
about e-mail versus E-mail versus email? And what do they recommend
as the plural of mouse? I'm on record in support of e-mail and
mouses. The New York Times style requires e-mail and mice. Wired
Style favors email and mouses.
</P>
<P>
   Little battles have been pitched over these points. We will have
to wait a few years to see whether the hyphen persists in e-mail.
But the more interesting skirmish is over computer mouses. Some
Internet users are agitating vehemently in favor of mice. IMHO,
it's their dialect, so they can do as they please. OTOH, they might
consider how the metaphorical use of louse (a scoundrel) becomes
louses _ a useful analogue (BTW, not analog in this sense). w/e.

&HT;     U.S. CITES FOUR AREAS AS MONEY-LAUNDERING CENTERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, declaring war on money
laundering, designated four regions Wednesday as ``high risk''
zones for financial crimes and promised additional law enforcement
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money laundering is a growing threat to the United States,''
Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat told a news conference
as he announced the program of stepped-up law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The four areas are the Texas-Arizona border with Mexico, New
York City and northern New Jersey, the Los Angeles metropolitan
area and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   `Money laundering undermines the confidence in the integrity of
our financial systems, facilitates crimes and corruption and allows
criminals to savor the rewards of their illegal actions,''
Eizenstat added.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said focusing law
enforcement efforts on the four areas and helping local authorities
strengthen their money-laundering surveillance efforts ``will
significantly raise the stakes for those who would profit from
crime and try to erase the taint of their criminality.''
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is the term used to describe efforts by
criminals to infuse the proceeds from crime _ typically narcotics
and arms trafficking, bank and securities fraud and counterfeiting
_ into the mainstream economy.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering has two steps. First, a criminal must place the
illegally earned funds into the financial system. Second, because
large amounts of currency deposited at banks usually raises red
flags, a launderer must do what is called ``layering'' or breaking
the funds into smaller chunks so as not to attract the attention of
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Wednesday's announcement, the officials said the
federal government plans to launch special money laundering teams
in these regions. The teams will include personnel from U.S.
Attorney's offices, state and local law enforcement and financial
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Treasury Department official said the program also will
provide additional money to local jurisdictions _ about $2.5
million in federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a start,'' said James Johnson, undersecretary of the
Treasury Department for enforcement. The federal aid can help local
governments buy computers or obtain technical assistance to get
their counter-money laundering operation up and running, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that the four designated areas also would be
eligible for a share of $15 million that the administration is
requesting from Congress to counter money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials don't have a clear picture of
how much illegal money moves through the four regions. The
International Monetary Fund estimates that some $600 billion is
laundered through financial institutions worldwide each year.
</P>
<P>
   `In light of American financial institutions prominent role in
the international financial system, a substantial portion of the
$600 billion is likely laundered thorough the United States,'' said
a joint Department of Treasury and Justice report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four regions has particular attributes that make
them attractive to criminals seeking to launder criminal proceeds,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas-Mexico border and the Arizona-Mexico border were
designated because of ``large volumes of currency'' mainly derived
from drug proceeds smuggled over the border to Mexico, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   The New York region is the world's leading financial center and
serves as headquarters for 44 of 50 leading banks.
</P>
<P>
   New York also is a hub for illegal activity because of its three
major airports and the Port of New York/New Jersey, the largest
such complex on the East Coast. The region is the main distribution
center in the Northeast for cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   New York area banks reported some $33 billion in suspicious
financial transactions in 1998 and 1999, more than any other region
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, the second largest city in the country after New
York and also a major financial center, is located only 150 miles
from the Mexican border. Los Angeles has the largest number of
financial institutions in the country. The seaport of Los Angeles
is the largest container port in the Untied States.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angles financial institutions reported $7 billion in
suspicious transactions in 1998 and 1999, second highest after New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's location in the Caribbean means that the island is
considered strategically important for drug traffickers and money
laundering. San Juan is the most active point of entry in the
Caribbean and the closest U.S. entry point for South American drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added federal government would concentrate on beefing up
the U.S. Customs surveillance along the border to watch for the
large cash transfers.

According to Atlanta-based CARE, the state's cash crops _ coconut,
betel, papaya _ suffered millions of dollars in damage. Rice
paddies were either swept away by the wind or rotted under water
one month before the December harvest. And 40,000 fishing families
lost their boats and equipment. ``People are still struggling. They

last month's torching of a banner of Gen. Robert E. Lee on a
holiday in his honor be treated by police and prosecutors as a hate
crime against Southerners. Meanwhile, the city council is
considering a proposal to rename two city bridges that honor
Confederate generals J.E.B. Stuart and Stonewall Jackson, replacing
them with the names of two civil rights activists. (Burritt,

   BASTROP, Texas _ Way out in the sticks, down a long Highway 20
lined with oaks and empty fields, you take a right on Pleasant
Chapel Road. Before long, there's Walnut Creek Ranch and riding
arena, with a companion pavilion furnished with old church pews and
chairs. People come here to rodeo or rope on Tuesdays, Thursdays
and Saturdays. On Sundays, it's Cowboy Church. One recent morning,
it was in the 30s. The faithful arrived wrapped in blankets and
ponchos, carrying hot dishes filled with everything from beans and
cornbread to raspberry cobbler. Everyone knew Rusty Edwards, the
owner of Walnut Creek Ranch, had been cooking barbecue since the
night before at his home. Some of the dishes went straight onto the
stove in the middle of the pavilion, where the coldest parishioners
huddled. There's an outhouse, horses and donkeys behind the fences,
a collection of horse trailers and a red canvas strung across the
back of the pavilion to block the wind. Smoke rose from the huge
pot-bellied stove, and children munched on doughnuts as they
played. (McEntee, Austin American-Statesman). WITH PHOTOS.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the mid-1950s, commercial passenger aircraft looked much
like the one that parted Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart at the
end of ``Casablanca'' _ they had propellers on each wing, and they
flew at what we would now consider a leisurely pace. It was not
until the British company de Havilland leveraged wartime research
on jet propulsion into a commercial jet airliner called the Comet
that rapid air transport became feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The Comet was able to fly faster and higher than propeller
planes, and it was put into service three years before any other
company could produce a competing jet. But the Comet suffered
several high-profile crashes in 1953 and '54, which gave rise to
doubts about the future of jet travel. Before the jet age could
begin in earnest, the safety of jet aircraft had to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was a lack of evidence about what had caused the
Comet accidents. With no witnesses, scanty evidence about what had
occurred and most of the wreckage lost at sea, the post-crash
analyses were sketchy. Eventually, some hard evidence turned up
revealing that pressure changes had weakened the window structure _
but not before frustrated aeronautical organizations across the
world had hypothesized at length on the basis of little hard data.
</P>
<P>
   One of the scientists involved, Dr. David Warren, devised a plan
that he hoped would lessen such frustration in the future. Warren,
a fuel chemist at the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in
Australia, proposed that recording devices be put in the cockpit to
capture information. Such devices are now present in all commercial
aircraft: the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Warren's 1954 report, the Australian laboratory
produced a prototype called the flight memory recorder, which is on
display in a science museum in Melbourne. The device recorded four
hours of pilot conversation and eight instrument readings by
engraving data onto a loop of wire, a design that soon gave way to
magnetic tape loops. The concept caught the interest of British
aviation authorities in the late 1950s, and aviation agencies
across the world had begun to mandate their use by the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The devices have changed in a number of ways since then, but the
basic idea remains the same. When the recorder reaches the end of
the tape loop, it simply records over the older data, providing a
constantly updated record for use in analyzing precisely what
happened during a flight.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the de facto standard for storing such data was in
digital format on tape. In the early 1990s, new designs were
introduced using solid-state flash memory; the new designs can
store 700 different flight parameters, enough to cover the huge
number of controls and systems in modern aircraft. Solid-state
recorders are still in the minority, but they are likely to become
much more common in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of flight data and cockpit voice recorders, then and
now, is to provide air transport safety agencies with enough
information to pin down the reasons for accidents and develop
safety procedures to prevent them. (The data are also sometimes
downloaded onto portable computers after routine flights for
airlines to use in establishing the normal flight characteristics
of each plane.)
</P>
<P>
   Every jet is loaded with sensors that measure things like the
position of engine controls, the altitude, the amount of thrust for
all engines and the temperature and pressure in various parts of
the aircraft, as well as the yaw (left and right motion), pitch (up
and down motion) and roll (motion around the longitudinal axis).
It's that kind of information _ and a whole lot more _ that ends up
on the flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Cockpit voice recorders capture not only voices, but also engine
noise, alarms and the sounds of the deployment of landing gear,
flaps and so on. The machine noise often proves invaluable in
analyzing accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Because flight data recorders are principally intended for
post-crash analyses, the boxes are positioned in the most
crash-resistant part of the airplane, the tail. The boxes are also
robust in their own right _ the parts where data are stored are
usually made of steel or titanium so they can withstand impact.
They also contain heat shields made of polymers or heat-resistant
wax.
</P>
<P>
   After a crash, the recorders go to the aviation safety authority
of the country where the accident took place. In the United States,
that is the National Transportation Safety Board. There, computers
download the information that is stored on the data recorder and
use it to create simulations reconstructing the flight. These
simulations can include all the cockpit meters and controls and
three-dimensional computer models of the aircraft itself.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board makes data from flight recorders available to
the airline and aircraft and engine manufacturers. What the
analyses find out can lead to changes in the manufacturing and
maintenance process for that type of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But flight data recording is not only for post-disaster
analyses. Airlines can use information about specific aircraft to
help with maintenance and other issues. A 737 that has been shown
by the data recorders to be more fuel-efficient than the norm, for
example, can carry less fuel and fly more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Since the data recorder is not readily accessible to technicians
in the field, many aircraft have secondary recorders stored near
the cockpit. Known as quick-access recorders, they use tape or
optical discs to store flight data for the airline to use during
routine checks.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, commercial aircraft must carry separate
flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders. Data recorders
must be able to hold the last 25 hours of instrument readings in
their memories and must be able to handle a minimum number of
sensor readings _ that minimum varies from 17 to 88, depending on
the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Voice recorders must retain the most recent 30 minutes of sound
on four channels _ three channels for crew microphones and one for
a fourth microphone that picks up ambient noise. (Newer aircraft
often have only two crew members in the cockpit so the microphone
that used to be reserved for the flight engineer usually records
intercom announcements these days.)
</P>
<P>
   The advent of solid-state recorders has expanded the scope of
the devices, and regulations are catching up with the technology.
Combination data-and-voice recorders are becoming so common that
the safety board has recommended that by 2005, some kinds of
aircraft should be required to have two such recorders: one in the
tail, the other near the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   And digital sound recorders can hold more than tape loops, so by
2003, new airplanes will be required to have sound recorders with a
capacity of 120 minutes, in line with current European aviation
standards.

   KABUL, Afghanistan _ Her name is Fatima, and she was risking a
beating. Defiantly, she stood outside, talking to a man. Her face
was uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Under Taliban rule, such openness by a woman is forbidden. But
Fatima said she did not care. She was growing used to a life with
some risk. Three months ago, she and a few other women decided to
break the law. They opened a school for girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban know,'' she said with a slight shrug, a gesture
that meant she herself was unsure what lay ahead. ``We have 250
students. How could they not know? Taliban spies come around,
asking this and that. Some approve, some don't. We'll wait and
see.''
</P>
<P>
   The school itself is a drafty, decrepit house with four rooms.
It is reachable through one of Kabul's narrow alleyways. In the
windows, sheets of torn, dirty plastic substitute for glass.
Hanging blankets are used for doors. The rent is $12 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the landlord wants more,'' Fatima complained. ``He sees
all these girls here. But what is he giving us? We get our water
out of a well. There is only one toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   A teacher by training, she is in her 30s. She was dressed
smartly in a black jacket and long skirt. Standing in an open
courtyard, her cheeks had become rosy from the morning cold. She
was wearing lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four years now, ever since the Taliban conquered
Kabul, this simple sight _ a woman's face as the wind blows her
hair _ has been impossibly rare. By law, women must don the
head-to-toe burka, their bodies camouflaged with cloth. They look
out at the world through a panel of thick mesh at eye level.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Fatima glanced over her shoulder at an
opening into the alleyway. People could see inside, and the Taliban
are stern dispensers of wrath.
</P>
<P>
   But she only entered the safety of the house when it was time to
see the classrooms. ``We teach the usual subjects: science, math,
geography and religion,'' she said. ``These children are learning
about the Caliph Omar, a great Muslim warrior at the time of the
Holy Prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   The school has no chairs or desks. Students sit on old rugs. Two
of the rooms have actual chalkboards. The other two have only
wooden slabs torn from cupboards. A fifth class, held outside on
the ground, has nothing.
</P>
<P>
   When the women opened the school, they simply allowed
word-of-mouth to pass through the neighborhood. ``The response was
amazing,'' Fatima said. ``We've ended up with more children than we
can manage. We hold sessions now in two shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the girls are eager, as if deprivation had left an
indelible hunger for education. The Taliban's earliest dictates had
banned women from the workplace and girls from schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the first years of their rule, some Taliban insisted they had
no objection to girls' education, but added that it as a low
priority. Afghanistan was in shambles after two decades of war.
They correctly pointed out that many schools were in ruins and
there was little money for teachers. Most boys were not getting an
education either.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they have relented somewhat. Women can work in
health care, so long as they do not mingle with men. Schooling for
girls remains officially prohibited, but exceptions are being made.
A few mullahs have been able to use their mosques as classrooms for
girls, though the instruction is primarily religious. Schools of
varying sizes have opened in homes, some secretly, others
discretely. The United Nations estimates that 10,000 young girls
are going to classes in Kabul _ and more all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most girls have lost four years of education,'' said Fatima,
going from one classroom into another. ``Children with illiterate
parents have suffered the most.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers have their favorites, those girls with extra spirit
coiled within. Fatima asked a few to come along outside. Kulsum, a
5-year-old with an elfin face, is trying to learn the alphabet.
``Listen to me recite,'' she said, and each time she made a mistake
she insisted on starting over from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Laili, 10, looks like a boy. This is intentional. Until a month
ago, she wore pants and kept her hair closely shorn. ``I pretended
to be a boy and studied in the boys' school,'' she said
triumphantly. ``It was the only way for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabira wants to be a writer, and poems seem about to unfurl from
her piercing brown eyes. But she is 14, which is three years too
old. Even those Taliban who favor schooling for girls say that age
11 ought to be the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm already too tall,'' she said. ``But I have a plan. I will
wear a burka and pretend I am a teacher when I am really still a
student.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatima listened to the children talk. ``These girls have
heart,'' she said proudly. ``They will do anything to get an
education. I have one. They should have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan has always had a male-dominated culture, but many
women in the cities had escaped the restraints. Jobs and schools
were their oases of independence.
</P>
<P>
   That is no longer so. At the thought of it, Fatima's face grew
somber and then cross. ``It is a sacred task to supply an education
to these young girls,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are always speaking of their jihad, their holy war
against the infidels. That is fine, she said. But their Islam is
not her Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what is sacred to me,'' Fatima repeated, opening her
arms and looking at her modest school. ``This is my jihad.''
</P>

   ``Trump: The America We Deserve'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Donald Trump with Dave Shiflett &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Political essays &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance Books, $24.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If one is compelled to consider billionaire developer Donald
Trump, the Yiddish word ``chutzpah'' leaps to mind. Meaning
shameless audacity, ``chutzpah'' fits Trump like a Hugo Boss suit,
summing up the Promethean ego that has motivated him to plaster his
name on Manhattan skyscrapers and up and down Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Having emerged from the brink of bankruptcy, Trump has found a
renewed sense of Caligulan self-worth, giving him the hubris to
right all the country's political wrongs. Perhaps predictably for
someone so estranged from humility, Trump has published his formula
for a better nation in ``The America We Deserve.'' We might
``deserve'' some of what Trump has to say, but few merit hearing it
from him.
</P>
<P>
   In this postmodern political world where former pro wrestlers
become governors, ``The America We Deserve'' is part of Trump's
bizarrely coquettish bid for the presidency. (On Feb. 13, Trump
announced he was giving up his campaign in light of Reform Party
turmoil. But it's not unheard of for departing Reform Party
candidates to reconsider their campaign farewells; recall Ross
Perot in 1992.) But medication more deleterious than the ailment
comes to mind when reading Trump's prescription. Whenever ``The
Donald'' stumbles upon a nugget of insight, his browbeating
delivery obliterates the point well taken. And it's certainly not
advisable for a political neophyte like Trump to come across as a
smug know-it-all. Unfortunately, Trump can't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   Through 11 chapters and an epilogue, ``The America We Deserve''
gambols across the political landscape, making shrink-wrapped
assessments of business, education, foreign policy, health care and
something called ``The American Way.'' It's a political issue cheat
sheet one might pocket before heading out to a local bar. There,
Trumpisms can be tossed off like so many beer nuts. To wit: New
York is ``the hottest city on the planet''; politics is a
``special-interest cesspool''; Pat Buchanan has ``totally lost
it''; and Bill Bradley is ``a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump's ``buck-stops-here'' solutions, often buttressed by
informative statistics, might ring truer were they not delivered in
such a patronizing tone. To be sure, Trump serves up some real
whoppers among the occasional sound judgments. For North Korea,
Trump advocates an aggressive disarmament. Great, but how?
Dilapidated schools, he opines, could be completely refurbished by
diverting the $50 billion spent on armed forces in Europe. So much
for NATO. As for crime, Trump would gladly carry out the death
penalty in public.
</P>
<P>
   Although inspired by Minnesota's new governor, Jesse Ventura,
Trump's views skew less toward the Reform Party and more toward the
Grand Old Party. His Republican loyalty shines through ad nauseam
praise of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and a severe case of
Ronald Reagan hero-worship.
</P>
<P>
   Trump musters great passion about the need to eradicate
inner-city crime and improve education. Unfortunately, these
moments of lucidity get lost in the braggadocio that has kept Trump
in the boardroom, and, so far, out of the White House.

FACT, FICTION MINGLE IN TALE OF OLD WASHINGTON

   ``Scandalmonger'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by William Safire &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historical fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, $27 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When news of President Clinton's affair with a young White House
intern flooded newspapers and airwaves in 1998, it launched a
lengthy season of national hand-wringing.
</P>
<P>
   With the Clinton administration in public denial, salacious
details of sexual escapades seeped out of Washington through
unidentified sources and high-placed leaks. Defenders of the
president decried the media for hitting a new low, and pundits
accused editors of unchecked sensationalism and misplaced
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a fascinating historical novel revealing that scandals
involving the private lives of national leaders are as old as the
Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scandalmonger,'' written by Washington columnist William
Safire, tells the story of early American newspaperman James
Thomson Callender and his vitriolic attacks against Alexander
Hamilton, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. A critic of Federalists
Hamilton and Adams, Callender eventually turns his poison pen to
Jefferson. Callender smells a hot story: Jefferson's secret affair
with, and progeny by, a black slave named Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Safire mixes a little fiction with a lot of history to make ``a
serious look into the long-ago more fun to write and more
interesting to read.'' That is accomplished. ``Scandalmonger'' is
well-paced and well-written; the novelist's approach breathes
humanity into characters usually presented as antiques in stiff,
dense histories.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even a careful reader is left to wonder: What is real here,
and what is made up?
</P>
<P>
   Safire goes to great lengths to provide disclosure. There are 40
pages of footnotes, and a bibliography. In an opening note to the
reader, he says that the characters and major events are real, save
for a concocted affair between Callender and the female
protagonist, Maria Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Many conversations are based on letters and diaries, and trials
have been reconstructed from transcripts and newspaper accounts.
Still, it is a bit much to ask readers to check the footnotes for
each chapter to see what has been enhanced. The line between
history and fiction remains a blur.
</P>
<P>
   Still, readers discover an early American society laden with the
same problems that pervade Washington two centuries later:
political manipulation and financial chicanery, moral failings and
government leaks to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a high-mindedness that sets this republic
apart from the Old World. At its core is a populist push to freely
criticize leaders and expose their shortcomings for public debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamilton case best exemplifies the nation's willingness to
air dirty laundry. His political ambitions are cut short after his
questionable dealings as treasury secretary are publicized by
Callender, and his extramarital affair becomes common knowledge.
But the conclusion finds Hamilton defending freedom of the press
when it is under attack from Jefferson, a political rival.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing fact with fiction, Safire is not unlike a Hollywood
director who takes liberties with a real story to bolster its
impact for a mass audience. ``Scandalmonger,'' while entertaining
and enlightening, should not be viewed as history.
</P>
<P>
   But if it gives readers a new perspective on national politics
and the role of the press, it is indeed worthwhile. &QL;

   ``In Praise of Public Life'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Sen. Joseph Lieberman &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Biography &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, $21 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Please, don't let this be a trend. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a
Connecticut Democrat, just published a news release in hardback. A
164-page news release.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that presidential contenders feel compelled to
release books as part of their campaign. But if we also have
potential future candidates simultaneously publishing their
memoirs/manifestoes, we'll be flooded with books such as
Lieberman's ``In Praise of Public Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's book is offered under the pretense that the senator
is greatly concerned that too few young people are interested in
government service.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but I suspect he has an ulterior motive. The book reads
like the autobiography of a wannabe president eager to get a head
start on promoting his prospects before the next time his party
seeks a nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is in his second Senate term. He serves on the Armed
Services and Governmental Affairs committees, so, at least in
theory, he is positioned to offer intriguing insights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lieberman tells us only the most obvious things about public
life. It's hard work. Personal life is closely scrutinized. It's
tough to raise enough money. It's hard on marriages. Occasionally,
some legislation is passed that brings about incremental change for
the good, and that makes it worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal more ink is spilled by Lieberman explaining
Lieberman. He takes pains to defines himself as a ``New Democrat.''
That breed of politician is one who recognizes that Americans hold
shared values which eclipse partisan politics. He votes, he says,
based on his recognition of the common agreement on what is good.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``In Praise of Public Life'' is an object lesson in
how an ambitious politician can use the publishing industry as a
tool in a still-undeclared campaign. The presidential election of
2000 is far from over, but here, depending on that outcome, we have
the first printed salvos for 2004 or 2008.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the Terence Conran Shop last week, plastic chairs
were as much in evidence as plastic money. For a moment, you could
even believe they were the obvious accessories for the middle-aged
woman, impeccably coordinated in cashmere and leather, who was
dragging one gigantic specimen across the floor. She had bought a
concave thumb-shape chair ($295) in six colors and was headed for a
glass dining table to admire the fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved plastic,'' said the woman, Monique Knowlton,
an art dealer. And there was plenty to choose from, opalescent as a
rain slick or brittle as a lunch tray, from $49 to $495. ``They're
very cool, as my son would say,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Plain jane no more, plastic furniture is coming in from the
patio. Not everyone thinks that's good news.
</P>
<P>
   Hilda Corsuti didn't even break stride as her fur coat brushed
past a $241 plastic armchair by Philippe Starck, shaped like an
open-petal tulip. ``Never!'' she said. ``It's a matter of taste.
I'd put a plastic chair in the yard, but that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nan Kempner, the socialite, was even more succinct on the
subject of plastic furniture at her Park Avenue home. ``The only
plastic I want is plastic surgery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   First among modern high-tech materials, plastic has become a
lightning rod for conflicting attitudes about the domestic
environment. How innovative, how fab, how vile!
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   From a symbol of industrial innovation in the 1940s to an emblem
of grooviness in the '60s and a byword for fakery in the
herbal-essence '70s, plastic has finally arrived as the It
material. Obviously, bell-bottomed Benjamin Braddock in ``The
Graduate'' blew it.
</P>
<P>
   From Martha Stewart, the queen of populism, to avant-garde
newcomers like Karim Rashid, the most influential names in design
endorse plastics in stylish products at Kmart, Target and
high-concept SoHo stores. Last week, the maharajah of mahogany,
Ralph Lauren, bid fair to become the pasha of plastic with a
$12,585 acrylic console at his Polo shop on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   At these prices, you'll be signing it up for insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But will plastic be more than a fad? Lighter in weight, thinner
in profile, turned out in softer colors and body-hugging shapes,
plastic furniture aspires to a dignified place in the home. If it
succeeds, it could change our notions of enduring domestic beauty.
``It has broken the glass ceiling already,'' said Paola Antonelli,
a curator for architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   William Leeds, an architect, said his friends were appalled that
he had considered leaving two plastic chairs by the English
designer Jasper Morrison out of doors at his new Southampton home.
``They're too good for the deck,'' he recalled their saying.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Today's plastics are a far cry from the earliest ones developed
in military experiments toward the end of World War II. Designers
like Buckminster Fuller, Charles and Ray Eames and Eero Saarinen
were attracted to the new material for its adaptability and
potential as inexpensive mass-produced furniture.
</P>
<P>
   By the '50s and '60s, Verner Panton of Denmark and Eero Aarnio
of Finland were experimenting with Fiberglas-reinforced plastic,
sometimes painstakingly hand-laminating, as in yacht making. The
'60s introduced injection-molded plastics _ and an endless
possibility of quickly produced, frankly cheap patio furniture,
along with plastic plates, plastic tableware and, ultimately,
plastic overload.
</P>
<P>
   New chemical formulas and injection technologies render the very
word ``plastic'' obsolete. Try polycarbonate, batch-dyed
polypropylene or translucent scratch-resistent thermoplastic
technopolymer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more sophisticated product now,'' said Paul Rowan
of Umbra, the manufacturer of Karim Rashid's $50 Oh! armchair.
``It's lightweight, saturated with color. It has a translucence,
and it can take shapes that you can't get with wood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oh! is made of 100 percent recyclable polypropylene with
steel tube legs and cutouts like a paper doll. It wiggles with you
when you sit on it. So is that good? ``I wanted to make a chair
that responds to the movement of your body,'' Rashid said. ``It's
more ergonomic.'' He varied the thickness to create flexibility,
especially around the back and lumbar.
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 Oh! chairs have sold since the product's
introduction in June. It was featured in Fortune magazine, and this
week it will appear in the Triennial exhibition of the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum among the best of show in
contemporary design.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finally relaxing about what furniture can look
like,'' said Ron Arad, a London-based designer who loves the
flexibility and technological derring-do of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Lee Mindel, an architect with Shelton, Mindel &AMP; Associates, was
not squeamish about integrating a contoured bench of white
surfboard fiberglass into a Fifth Avenue living room. He says
plastic introduces a note of sculptural refinement to a formal room
without being distracting, comparing it to a form by Hans Arp or
Brancusi. ``It's not ye olde furniture, that's for sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of ye olde $60 billion furniture industry, based in
North Carolina, plastic barely registers on the Richter scale. ``To
most people it still means cheap, and they aren't ready to accept
it in their homes,'' said Lee Buchanan, the furniture editor at
Home Furnishings News, a trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Oliver Gropp, editor in chief of House Beautiful, put a
plastic molded rocking chair by the Eameses, a gift, in the living
room. ``I moved it out,'' he said. ``You slip out of it.'' He sees
plastic furniture mostly for early nesters. ``You don't see people
trading up to it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to the dotcom set, the plastics that came out in
the '60s are enjoying a revival, as copies and reinterpretations.
The 1960 Panton chair is still in production; advances led to the
more durable polypropylene version bought by Knowlton.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek lacquered Ball chair and acrylic Bubble chair by the
Finnish designer Eero Aarnio never looked better. (Last June, it
was on the cover of Harper's Bazaar.) Aarnio still works the
material in Helsinki, most recently designing a prototype for a
plastic mesh rocking chair. Noting that plenty of plastics are
hidden in the joints of today's plushest upholstered furniture,
Aarnio said philosophically: ``Today's generation is born in the
midst of plastic. Their first night is spent in a plastic bed in
the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Kartell, the Italian manufacturer, which has a store on Greene
Street, has been working in plastics for 50 years. In 1988, the
company decided the time was ripe to line up the new talent.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic furniture may be the only way that most consumers can
afford products by high-style designers like Philippe Starck,
Antonio Citterio, Vico Magistretti and Arad. Kartell says it has
sold hundreds of thousands of translucent stacking drawers on a
metal frame by Citterio since they were introduced for $659 in
1995. Last April, Kartell introduced La Marie by Starck, a $185
chair of polycarbonate (the Veuve Cliquot of plastics). The company
has steadily sold about 1,000 of them a month in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plastic is interesting to me because it is not made by God,''
Starck said. ``It is created by human intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He is working on products made of gel packets adapted from the
medical supplies industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the resistance to plastic is not only psychological. John
Ryan, the floor manager at Kartell, said that consumers sometimes
go into shock when they see the high prices. Much time is spent in
the store explaining why designer plastics cost so much.
</P>
<P>
   The short version goes something like this: First there's the
research into new methods, like nitrogen injection, or vacuum
molding, which might take a year or two. (Kartell encourages its
designers to pursue new technology as if it were some kind of
extreme sport.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the mold itself, a ballroom-size machine, which has
to be custom built for each furniture piece and which could easily
cost $1 million to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not polypropylene shampoo bottles here,'' Ryan said.
(Don't forget to include in your budget an allowance for Windex to
erase fingerprints.) Even Mindel, for whom a glamorous image is
all, conceded that plastic furniture can look like something from
``The Outer Limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Nan Kempner gamely contemplated an orange
injection-molded armchair design by Ron Arad in her perfectly
appointed Park Avenue living room. Amid the velvet-covered Italian
Rococo antiques, the gilt Chinoiserie mirror and a pair of Moorish
figurines, the chair stood out like a lollipop stuck in a lobster
salad. But Kempner managed to be generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good room isn't a good room,'' she said, ``until it has
something crummy in it.'' &QL;

 &HT;    GORE LAUNCHES HIS BID FOR CENTRIST VOTERS
 &HT;    Eds: May be updated with quotes from Michigan event this
evening.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ His claim on the Democratic presidential
nomination all but official, Vice President Al Gore wasted no time
Wednesday launching his general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He began by reaching out in television interviews to the
independent voters who have fueled Sen. John McCain's campaign in
the Republican contest against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and
have swelled the primary voting ranks.
</P>
<P>
   And after visiting his elderly mother in nearby Carthage, Gore
began a trip that advisers said was designed to begin wooing
moderate and reform-minded voters in the general election
battleground states of Michigan and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Gore planned a Wednesday evening meeting with undecided voters
at Wayne State University near Detroit. On Thursday, he will be
joined by former Vice President Walter Mondale in a visit to a
Minnesota high school to promote his education reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ask all of those who have supported (McCain and
Bradley) to look at this campaign as their cause,'' Gore said
Wednesday morning on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, swept by Gore in all 16 Democratic contests
Tuesday, is expected to withdraw from the Democratic race on
Thursday and endorse Gore. That gesture is designed to solidify
Democratic ranks against Bush, the presumptive GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   That means Gore, in the coming days, will begin his courtship of
``McCainiacs,'' as thousands of first-time voters have come to be
known in the wake of Arizona senator's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think McCain voters are much closer to Al Gore on issues
than they are to George Bush,'' Bob Shrum, one of Gore's senior
media strategists, told reporters after Gore's sweep of the Super
Tuesday primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, McCain and Bush share the same view on some of the key
issues separating Republicans and Democrats. Both oppose abortion
and gun control measures, and both support taxpayer-financed
competition between public and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's tax cut proposals resemble Gore's more than Bush's.
And like Gore, McCain has proposed using part of the federal budget
surplus to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, McCain and Gore support campaign finance reforms
that would eliminate soft money, large donations to the parties
that are largely unregulated by federal campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   To win in November, both Gore and Bush ``have to come up with a
way of attracting the pro-reform, pro-change voters who were
attracted to John McCain and Bill Bradley,'' said Stuart
Rothenberg, a political analyst for CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls in Tuesday's California primary illustrate
Rothenberg's point. Of voters questioned Tuesday as they left the
polls, Gore was preferred by 36 percent, Bush 28 percent, McCain 23
percent and Bradley 9 percent. To carry California and its 54
electoral votes, the largest number of any state, Gore and Bush
have to attract the McCain vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategists believe they have the advantage because McCain
forced Bush to rely on the most conservative members of the
Republican Party to win the GOP nomination. Consequently, Gore, in
his victory speech Tuesday night, declared the Democratic Party the
``mainstream'' party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategists also believe they can paint Bush as out of the
political mainstream on key issues while contrasting uninterrupted
economic prosperity during the Clinton administration with the
recessions that occurred during the two previous Republican
presidencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out of step with America,'' Gore campaign spokesman
Chris Lehane told reporters. ``George W. Bush is right and wrong.
He's far to the right on issues like gun control, a patient's bill
of rights and the environment, and he's wrong on the economy.''

<P>
   Before the mid-1950s, commercial passenger aircraft looked much
like the one that parted Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart at the
end of ``Casablanca'' _ they had propellers on each wing, and they
flew at what we would now consider a leisurely pace. It was not
until the British company de Havilland leveraged wartime research
on jet propulsion into a commercial jet airliner called the Comet
that rapid air transport became feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The Comet was able to fly faster and higher than propeller
planes, and it was put into service three years before any other
company could produce a competing jet. But the Comet suffered
several high-profile crashes in 1953 and '54, which gave rise to
doubts about the future of jet travel. Before the jet age could
begin in earnest, the safety of jet aircraft had to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was a lack of evidence about what had caused the
Comet accidents. With no witnesses, scanty evidence about what had
occurred and most of the wreckage lost at sea, the post-crash
analyses were sketchy. Eventually, some hard evidence turned up
revealing that pressure changes had weakened the window structure _
but not before frustrated aeronautical organizations across the
world had hypothesized at length on the basis of little hard data.
</P>
<P>
   One of the scientists involved, Dr. David Warren, devised a plan
that he hoped would lessen such frustration in the future. Warren,
a fuel chemist at the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in
Australia, proposed that recording devices be put in the cockpit to
capture information. Such devices are now present in all commercial
aircraft: the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Warren's 1954 report, the Australian laboratory
produced a prototype called the flight memory recorder, which is on
display in a science museum in Melbourne. The device recorded four
hours of pilot conversation and eight instrument readings by
engraving data onto a loop of wire, a design that soon gave way to
magnetic tape loops. The concept caught the interest of British
aviation authorities in the late 1950s, and aviation agencies
across the world had begun to mandate their use by the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The devices have changed in a number of ways since then, but the
basic idea remains the same. When the recorder reaches the end of
the tape loop, it simply records over the older data, providing a
constantly updated record for use in analyzing precisely what
happened during a flight.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the de facto standard for storing such data was in
digital format on tape. In the early 1990s, new designs were
introduced using solid-state flash memory; the new designs can
store 700 different flight parameters, enough to cover the huge
number of controls and systems in modern aircraft. Solid-state
recorders are still in the minority, but they are likely to become
much more common in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of flight data and cockpit voice recorders, then and
now, is to provide air transport safety agencies with enough
information to pin down the reasons for accidents and develop
safety procedures to prevent them. (The data are also sometimes
downloaded onto portable computers after routine flights for
airlines to use in establishing the normal flight characteristics
of each plane.)
</P>
<P>
   Every jet is loaded with sensors that measure things like the
position of engine controls, the altitude, the amount of thrust for
all engines and the temperature and pressure in various parts of
the aircraft, as well as the yaw (left and right motion), pitch (up
and down motion) and roll (motion around the longitudinal axis).
It's that kind of information _ and a whole lot more _ that ends up
on the flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Cockpit voice recorders capture not only voices, but also engine
noise, alarms and the sounds of the deployment of landing gear,
flaps and so on. The machine noise often proves invaluable in
analyzing accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Because flight data recorders are principally intended for
post-crash analyses, the boxes are positioned in the most
crash-resistant part of the airplane, the tail. The boxes are also
robust in their own right _ the parts where data are stored are
usually made of steel or titanium so they can withstand impact.
They also contain heat shields made of polymers or heat-resistant
wax.
</P>
<P>
   After a crash, the recorders go to the aviation safety authority
of the country where the accident took place. In the United States,
that is the National Transportation Safety Board. There, computers
download the information that is stored on the data recorder and
use it to create simulations reconstructing the flight. These
simulations can include all the cockpit meters and controls and
three-dimensional computer models of the aircraft itself.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board makes data from flight recorders available to
the airline and aircraft and engine manufacturers. What the
analyses find out can lead to changes in the manufacturing and
maintenance process for that type of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But flight data recording is not only for post-disaster
analyses. Airlines can use information about specific aircraft to
help with maintenance and other issues. A 737 that has been shown
by the data recorders to be more fuel-efficient than the norm, for
example, can carry less fuel and fly more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Since the data recorder is not readily accessible to technicians
in the field, many aircraft have secondary recorders stored near
the cockpit. Known as quick-access recorders, they use tape or
optical discs to store flight data for the airline to use during
routine checks.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, commercial aircraft must carry separate
flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders. Data recorders
must be able to hold the last 25 hours of instrument readings in
their memories and must be able to handle a minimum number of
sensor readings _ that minimum varies from 17 to 88, depending on
the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Voice recorders must retain the most recent 30 minutes of sound
on four channels _ three channels for crew microphones and one for
a fourth microphone that picks up ambient noise. (Newer aircraft
often have only two crew members in the cockpit so the microphone
that used to be reserved for the flight engineer usually records
intercom announcements these days.)
</P>
<P>
   The advent of solid-state recorders has expanded the scope of
the devices, and regulations are catching up with the technology.
Combination data-and-voice recorders are becoming so common that
the safety board has recommended that by 2005, some kinds of
aircraft should be required to have two such recorders: one in the
tail, the other near the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   And digital sound recorders can hold more than tape loops, so by
2003, new airplanes will be required to have sound recorders with a
capacity of 120 minutes, in line with current European aviation
standards.

 `SMELLS AND BELLS' OF LENT CAN'T BE FOUND ON THE WEB
 (Commentary)   &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A recent survey found that those who are online enjoy less human
contact than those who are not. Does this electronic trend toward
isolation threaten religious life that traditionally has been
centered on congregations?
 &HT;    Journalist Mary Alice Williams, on the PBS program ``Religion
and Ethics Newsweekly,'' recently observed that ``With tens of
thousands of religious Web sites and a home page for every
organized faith group and then some, people can get a dose of
religion without ever getting out of their jammies.
 &HT;    ``Some prophesy the Web will reduce us to a virtual community of
believers practicing a kind of `McFaith' _ fast, convenient, but
hardly nourishing.''
 &HT;    Web-McFaith stands in stark contrast to the upcoming church
season: Lent. Beginning with Ash Wednesday on March 8, Christians
will make their annual liturgical pilgrimage toward Good Friday and
Easter.
 &HT;    Every year, the spiritual practices of those 40 days impinge on
my hectic spring schedule _ they are neither fast nor convenient.
 &HT;    But they are nourishing. With varying degrees of success or
commitment over the last two decades, I have tried to take Lent
seriously. Most years I find Lenten spirituality difficult; some
years easy. But nearly every year, I have come to understand
myself, God, liturgy, scriptures, and my church community in
greater spiritual depth through Lent.
 &HT;    I know many Christians who eagerly await Lent. Some actually
converted or returned to faith as a result of Lenten observance.
Their faith stories are often quite similar: Lent introduced them
to ``real church,'' a serious, rigorous and intentional spiritual
community.
 &HT;    What observers have failed to notice is that as our society
speeds up (the Internet being only the latest technological
manifestation of such) religious faith and practice must slow down.
 &HT;    Admittedly, there are nearly 30,000 religion Web sites with
nearly 25 million regular visitors. I'm one. But where do I go for
``serious'' spirituality? Not to the Web. I go to church.
 &HT;    It seems almost deviant to say so, but traditional church
appears to be making a comeback among computer savvy baby-boomers
and Generation Xers. In contrast to the disembodied spirituality of
cyberspace, people seem eager for sensual religious experience _
kneeling, incense, bread and wine, fasting, communal prayer,
congregational singing. The more ``smells and bells'' the better.
Thus, the Internet actually creates a need for human connection to
the divine. The stuff of traditional religion _ from liturgies to
pie suppers _ cannot (yet) be experienced over the Web. It exists
only in musty old buildings whose wood is scented with decades of
candle smoke; through whose windows colored light plays across the
carpet.
 &HT;    Something mystical and mysterious happens inside those
buildings_ something beyond our greatest technological
achievements. Those old buildings are sacred space, places where
the human and divine have touched for generations.
 &HT;    And I mean really touched.
 &HT;    Last year, the Benedictine monks of St. John's Abbey in
Collegeville, Minn., unveiled the first page of a new hand-written
Bible they have commissioned. It is the first hand-written Bible to
be produced in the West since the introduction of the printing
press and will not be completed until 2004.
 &HT;    The St. John's Bible is not intended to glorify a fading past,
but rather it is meant to be a ``21st-century Bible for the 21st
century.'' The monks want to ``link human imagination and the human
hand with the word of God'' thus making the ``word of God live on a
page.''
 &HT;    The primary artist, English calligrapher Donald Jackson, says
the quill pen is ``part of yourself; made of the same stuff as
fingernail.'' Like all artists' tools, it is ``an extension of
one's own fingers.'' And in the touching of finger to page, the
word of God creates a ``visual harmonic'' which strikes a
``universal chord.''
 &HT;    Human touch _ whether a hand-written Bible, Bach played on the
organ, or bread baked for the Eucharist_ is the only real access we
have to the divine. Because spirituality is itself disembodied, it
needs human bodies to be known.
 &HT;    The Internet, itself disembodied, cannot ultimately serve this
purpose. It does not come through the touch of a keyboard. We human
beings need material stuff to know that which is Spirit; we need
one another to touch the Divine.
 &HT;    Like the St. John's Bible, like Lent, spirituality cannot be
fast. Wisdom, insight, knowing oneself and God, serving and caring
for one another, marriage, friendship, parenthoodall take time.
 &HT;    The Internet may be a clever tool to assist our quests, but it
is not the artist's tool, it is not the community found in the
fellowship hall, and it is not the joy found through the rigor of
lifelong Lenten discipline.
 &HT;    You do not need high-speed access to find it; you only need go
down the street.

   Before frequent flier miles, there were S&AMP;H green stamps. Before

   The challenge for S&AMP;H will be to persuade online users that a

mother redeemed them for a new blender, let me refresh your memory.
At the peak of trading stamp popularity in the mid-1960s, most gas
stations and supermarkets were offering them to shoppers. S&AMP;H
operated 800 free-standing redemption centers nationwide, and in
the mid-1960s it printed more stamps than the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Each stamp had a pale green background embellished by a jaunty
red ``S&AMP;H'' logo, a serial number and fine print that read ``Value
1 2/3 mills,'' which meant that you could redeem it for cash.
</P>
<P>
   But when I was a child, nobody I knew would have considered
trading green stamps for mere money; they were worth far more than
that. For my family _ sitting around the kitchen table for hours,
licking that tapioca-flavored glue and filling Quick Saver Books
until the pages began to warp and sag under the weight of wet
stamps _ the experience provided the opportunity to ask the big
questions: Were we the sort of people who would redeem our hoarded
stamps for the kinds of sensible items that you could really build
a postwar lifestyle around, like a 12-cup coffee percolator or a
toaster? Or would we blow everything on something frivolous, like
that family down the block who redeemed their stamps for a
basketball that their kids lost the next day?
</P>
<P>
   Green stamps confirmed us as proud members of the first
generation that succumbed to the heady lure of fancy new
appliances. ``That was the year,'' my mother said, remembering one
green stamp purchase in 1969, ``that we upgraded from a two-slice
to a four-slice.'' And toast never tasted so good.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the popularity of green stamps waned in the 1970s,
the S&AMP;H logo still exerts a powerful, Proustian pull on nearly
everyone who was old enough back then to lick. ``The most
compelling thing about S&AMP;H green stamps,'' said Melissa Shore, an
analyst at Jupiter Communications, ``is that whenever I tell
someone that the company is entering the online market, people
immediately launch into an emotional story about their experience
of growing up with S&AMP;H green stamps. They have strong brand equity
and a hundred years of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is understandable that S&AMP;H wants to repackage the
old-fashioned appeal of green stamps into something the company's
executives describe with straight faces as a ``complete loyalty
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company founded in 1896,'' said Walter Beinecke, the
executive vice president of Greenpoints.com and a great-grandson of
an S&AMP;H founder, Thomas Sperry. ``But we're also a 104-year-old
dot-com startup.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers, however, do not come loaded with a sense of taste, at
least not yet. Clicking on a Web site seems a poor substitute for
giddy feelings that the original stamps induced in millions of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: can you convey, online, that emotional
feeling that people remember?'' Shore said. It is a question that
could be asked of any old-style retailer poised to take its
business to the Web. S&AMP;H has a few additional hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents remembered the Depression and the war, and
collecting trading stamps was all part of the dream of affluence,
which meant acquiring your Levitt home and your television and your
first appliances,'' said David Monod, a historian and the author of
``Store Wars: Shopkeepers and the Culture of Mass Marketing,
1890-1939.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely had to do with the physical feeling of the stamp
itself, and the fact that your whole family sat around the table
doing it together.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition to the Web becomes even more problematic because
the domain name Greenstamps.com belongs to two California lawyers,
Sullwold &AMP; Hughes, who think of themselves as S&AMP;H, too, and say
they will not give up the name.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenpoints officials said the name would have been too
old-fashioned for them. ``We would not want to be green stamps on
the Internet anyway, because that speaks to an older way of doing
things,'' Beinecke said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1896, Beinecke said, Sperry &AMP; Hutchinson became the the first
independent trading stamp company to distribute stamps and books to
merchants, beginning in Michigan, and by the turn of the century,
trading stamps were very popular.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Beinecke said, was that the S&AMP;H incentive program
rewarded shoppers both for timely payment (the stamps were given
out in exchange for cash purchases) and loyalty to specific
merchants.
</P>
<P>
   But after the First World War, ``the novelty wore off and nobody
used them,'' Monod said. ``Trading stamps tended to be popular in
inflationary times, when people were concerned about prices, but in
the 1920s, prices were stable. And in the 1930s, prices were
deflationary.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, to protect independent merchants from chain
stores, states began passing fair-trade laws to prevent retailers
from cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers had to find ways to entice customers and give them
price breaks,'' said Sandra Stringer Vance, a historian who
specializes in retail history since World War II and a co-author of
``Wal-Mart: A History of Sam Walton's Retail Phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of trading stamps revived, and by the middle of
the century, S&AMP;H had become a powerful national company whose
success was imitated by scores of local companies with names like
Gold Bond, Blue Chip and Plaid Stamps, said Jeff R. Lonto, a
Minneapolis author who published ``The Trading Stamp Story.''
</P>
<P>
   But the climate changed drastically during the oil embargo in
1973-1974. ``At that time, 40,000 gas stations were giving out
green stamps, but a number of them went out of business or
consolidated,'' Beinecke said.
</P>
<P>
   The trading stamp craze quickly faded. Although S&AMP;H never
stopped the program _ even today about 400 independent businesses,
including gas stations and travel agents, give out stamps and the
company still operates a central customer service center in Atlanta
_ green stamps disappeared from the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Beinecke's family sold the company in 1981, but last year he led
a group of investors who bought S&AMP;H in the hope of re-inventing the
incentive program in a digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than licking and sticking stamps as a family,'' said
Rod Parker, president of Greenpoints.com, ``today's family will go
to the Web site and see how many points they have and what they can
get, and think, `Wow, this can be rewarding.' It's today's culture.
It's fast, it's simple and you never have to leave the house.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you persuade people to abandon the physical sensation
of holding and licking a stamp? This is the same question that
E-Stamp Corp. confronted after beginning to sell digital stamps
online last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that in the consumer market, people were tied to the
physical stamp,'' said Nicole Eagan, E-Stamp's senior vice
president for sales and marketing, ``and we actually bridge the
electronic and physical worlds, because you can buy the stamps in
the e-commerce world but then you can still print them out.'' You
can print it on Avery labels and peel it off and stick it on the
envelope, or you can print it right on the envelope, or you can
print it on a document to show through a window envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Postage, of course, is very palpable: you need it to mail in the
bills. But the points and coupons behind Greenpoints.com and a
number of other online incentive programs that arrived on the
Internet months ago _ like MyPoints.com, ClickRewards.com and
FreeRide.com _ are less tangible.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpoints.com will also offer shoppers offline opportunities
to earn points, said Parker. One merchant, the Foodtown supermarket
chain, is started the program in 10 stores in the New York
metropolitan area. Shoppers keep track of their points with a card
that looks like a credit card, Parker said, and will be able to
redeem both offline and online greenpoints for rewards.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, the programs have to offer rewards that
today's jaded shoppers really believe are worth earning. Airline
mileage? Yes. The opportunity to donate your accumulated points to
charity? Maybe. Toasters? No.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 300 rewards that you could earn when Greenpoints.com
began last week (the list keeps growing, and the company plans to
offer more than 1,000 rewards online by the end of March) were
easy-to-earn items _ like a movie theater ticket (2,400 points) or
five $1 gift certificates for Wendy's fast food (2,400 points). But
so what if you can accumulate enough points to redeem those items
very quickly? You earn 20 greenpoints for each dollar spent. Does
that really feel like a reward to today's shoppers?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are wild consumers these days, but we're desensitized to it
because we buy so much,'' Monod said. ``The things that excite
people today are terribly, terribly expensive, like travel, which
most people consider a luxury, or a new stereo system.''
</P>
<P>
   If you manage to accumulate more than 100,000 greenpoints, you
could get something of real value, like a 13-inch Panasonic color
television (141,600), a travel certificate for a round-trip
domestic flight on Continental Airlines (149,000) or a ski vacation
in Canada (249,000).
</P>
<P>
   But at the introductory rate of 20 points per dollar, you would
have to spend $12,450 to get the ski vacation. Knowing that, would
you be willing to sign up, provide personal information and use the
Greenpoints.com home page as a shopping trip starting point so the
company can keep track of your purchases?
</P>
<P>
   I did. I visited www.greenpoints.com _ and was momentarily
catapulted into the lost world of a particular spring morning in
1969, the year that 80 percent of American households were
collecting trading stamps and a trip to the redemption center in
the next town meant that my mother first had to wrestle my little
brother into ``good clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing up _ giving my e-mail address _ earned me 3,000 points.
I got an additional 1,000 points for providing personal information
like name, sex and number of people in my household, and 500 more
by answering a survey question.
</P>
<P>
   With that many points in the bank, I surveyed some of the
possible purchases, many of which were not on any shopper's wish
list: I'm thinking, for example, of the potpourri to ``add soft
fragrance to any room'' (3,600 points). I decided to hold on to my
points. Instead, I scanned the list of 61 partner merchants (as of
this week, the number of merchants had increased to 88), which
included well-known retailers like OfficeMax.com, Borders.com and
LandsEnd.com.
</P>
<P>
   I had been planning to buy children's bathing suits anyway, and
when I clicked on LandsEnd.com, a second browser window appeared on
the screen to take me there. I bought eight bathing suits for $170,
and when I closed the second browser window I found myself back at
Greenpoints.com, which according to my calculations now owed me
3,400 greenpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Even after my points are credited _ I am still awaiting
confirmation _ my 7,900 total will not be enough to get anything I
want. Neither the Dr. Talking Clock (7,200 points) nor the rugged
50-foot garden hose (7,200) nor anything else in that range really
appealed to me.
</P>
<P>
   I would not mind earning a free airline ticket, and I might not
even lose interest before I bought the necessary 372 bathing suits
_ or their equivalents. Now, if Greenpoints.com wanted to send me
the equivalent value in actual stamps, I would stay up all night,
licking their backs and laboriously pasting them into books.
</P>
<P>
   But then, I'm sentimental.

NIGHT LIGHTS A PROBLEM? NOT REALLY, SCIENTISTS NOW SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two new studies suggest that parents who leave night lights on
will not night make their children nearsighted, contradicting a
report in May indicating an association between night lights and
myopia.
</P>
<P>
   Two groups of researchers report in the current journal Nature
that they were unable to duplicate the results of an earlier study
suggesting that children who sleep with a night light until age 2
are three times more likely to develop nearsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This night light question has been the biggest question that
some of my colleagues have gotten from parents. It has worried
thousands of parents unnecessarily,'' said Jane Gwiazda, director
of the Children's Vision Laboratory at the New England College of
Optometry in Boston, one of the two centers that conducted the
follow-up studies. The other was done at Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   The original study, also published in Nature, was conducted by
scientists at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia. It raised the possibility that too much
light during the first two years of life prompts the rapidly
developing eyes to grow excessively and throws them out of focus.
</P>
<P>
   The follow-up studies found no difference between the rate of
myopia for children who slept in the dark and those who slept with
a night light.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the real explanation may be _ at least indirectly
_ heredity, the researchers said. Myopic parents are more likely to
have myopic children. And myopic parents may like to leave night
lights on so they can see better at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it made it easier to find their baby at night,'' Gwiazda
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston group studied 213 people ranging in age from 2 to 24,
with a mean age of 11. It found that 20 percent of the children who
slept with night lights developed myopia, exactly the same
percentage as the youngsters who slept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio State study, which involved 1,220 children with a
median age of 10, found the percentage of children who became
nearsighted after sleeping with a night light as babies was about
17 percent. Statistically, that was the same as the 20 percent of
the children who slept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the percentage of children who slept in a fully lit
room and later became nearsighted was essentially the same, at 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest link the Ohio State study found was between the
number of nearsighted parents and their use of night lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprise, surprise: Those of us who can't see like to leave
the lights on,'' said Karla Zadnik, an Ohio State optometrist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Stone, an ophthalmologist and coauthor of the
Pennsylvania study, said in a response published in Nature that
widespread publicity may have led parents in the follow-up studies
to underreport night light use out of guilt for possibly
contributing to myopia.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Andres, 35, of Cambridge, Mass. and her three children
participated in the study at the New England College of Optometry.
She said she stopped using night lights when she heard about the
association between the lights and nearsightedness. Andres, who is
not nearsighted, said her children _ 7 1/2, 5, and 18 months _ have
no eye problems.

<P>
   ``Ashes and Lace &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By B.J. Hoff &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Tyndale House, $11.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in B.J. Hoff's ``Ashes and Lace'' has a secret, and
those secrets that didn't come out in her previous novel, ``Cloth
of Heaven,'' are coming out now. And when they do ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashes and Lace'' continues the Ohio author's 19th-century
Irish-American saga of the successful, roguish immigrant Jack Kane;
widow Samantha Harte, who is drawn to the publishing magnate
despite his lack of faith and her previous husband's abuse;
teen-ager Terese Sheridan, who falls desperately ill during her
voyage to the United States; artist Brady Kane, sojourner in
Ireland and the ne'er-do-well father of Terese's illegitimate
child; and the devout Gabriel Vaughan, who is determined to keep
his deaf ward, Roweena, from being Brady's next conquest.
</P>
<P>
   Hoff's prose is emotional and evangelistic and provides Edgar
Allan Poe with a cameo appearance. Even though fire, snow, death,
rage and rape all figure into the story (onstage or off), Hoff can
hardly be accused of sensationalism, and ``Ashes and Lace'' has
about as many happy endings as one could want. &QL;

<P>
   Fernando Ortega &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Myrrh Records &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Ortega is, first and foremost, a storyteller. His songs
are compelling not because of melodies, harmonies or fancy
musicianship, but because they tell tales: of faith, family,
triumph and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   That's the standard he set on his 1997 Myrrh album ``This Bright
Hour,'' his first release on a major label, and continued on 1998's
``The Breaking of the Dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   He remains faithful to it on ``Home.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories include uplifting tales of creation and a neighbor's
daughter; sad tales of a homeless woman and a man with Alzheimer's;
a bittersweet tale of earthly suffering before heavenly glory; an
introspective tale of life on the road away from family; a prayer
of blessing for his new home, written by friends (the inspiration
for the album title); and two plaintive, heartfelt hymns, ``Pass Me
Not'' and ``Give Me Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   The words are poetic, thoughtful, insightful. Ortega's
expressive voice breathes life into them. Clearly, this is what
Ortega does as well as anyone singing Christian music today.
</P>
<P>
   That is what ``Home'' has in common with Ortega's first two
Myrrh albums. Where it differs is in the music, and it's a change
for the better.
</P>
<P>
   The album was recorded ``live'' in a studio with a band, giving
it a more energetic feel. There's even a couple of upbeat cuts,
allowing Ortega to have two songs _ ``This Good Day'' and ``Give Me
Jesus'' _ getting radio play simultaneously on Contemporary
Christian and Inspirational formats. &QL;

HISTORIANS HONOR `MILLION-DOLLAR MISTAKE'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DALE WHITE   Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ Next week, the Manatee County Historical
Society will officially celebrate a so-called blunder by nature _ a
crop mutation known as pink grapefruit _ by marking the spots where
the once-peculiar fruit was discovered nearly 90 years ago.
Generations of citrus growers have called pink grapefruit ``the
million-dollar mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was a freak event,'' said Andy Reasoner of Oneco,
great-grandson of the nurseryman who first marketed the pink
grapefruit. ``It happened purely by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, R.B. Foster, manager of Kimball C. Atwood's grove east
of Palmetto, noticed a biological mutation on a limb of a tree
otherwise laden with seedless, yellow grapefruit. He wondered if
the thin-skinned grapefruits on that limb were similar to
discolored fruit he found earlier and suspected of being diseased.
</P>
<P>
   He cut into a sample fruit from that limb and found rosy pink
flesh instead of the pale pulp of ordinary grapefruit. Atwood
marked the limb with a red neckerchief, so he could find it again
in the 25,000-tree grove.
</P>
<P>
   Also that year, Samuel Collins, an employee at W.B. Thompson's
grove in Oneco, noticed the same biological mutation in grapefruit
on a single tree limb there.
</P>
<P>
   Both groves took budwood from the trees to the Reasoner Brothers
Royal Palm Nurseries in Oneco. Nursery owner Egbert Reasoner
grafted the budwood onto orange stock, creating trees that produced
the Foster Pink Grapefruit and Thompson Pink Grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mutation in the plant world takes an act of God or Mother
Nature,'' Andy Reasoner said. ``But it's not just that the pink
grapefruit was a mutation. What made the difference is that someone
recognized this mutation, on one limb of one tree out of hundreds
of acres of trees and millions of fruit harvested, and recognized
that the mutation was significant and was able to propagate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, pink grapefruit received poor reviews. Growers at the
Florida Horticultural Society joked that it was ``suitable only for
ladies' pink teas.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Egbert Reasoner was its lone advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Then a freeze devastated Florida's citrus groves. Growers asked
Reasoner to supply them with trees. They bought every citrus tree
he had in stock _ except for the pink grapefruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   After the same freeze devastated groves in Texas' Rio Grande
Valley, growers there came to Reasoner looking for stock. All that
Reasoner could provide was pink grapefruit trees. The Texans bought
a railcar full. By the 1920s, the Texas citrus industry had
capitalized greatly on making the pink grapefruit a breakfast-table
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Reasoner and other descendants of the nursery man who first
promoted the pink grapefruit plan to attend the marker dedications.
``It wouldn't be correct if we weren't there,'' Reasoner said.

DOCTOROW'S LATEST NOVEL SAMPLES THE MODERN MIND

 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The novels of E.L. Doctorow are known for their riffs on
American history.
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``Welcome to Hard Times,'' published in 1960,
was set on the 19th-century American frontier and used the creation
of a small town as a metaphor for the rise and corruption of
civilization. His best known work, ``Ragtime'' (1975), depicted a
nation on the verge of World War I, at the genesis of the
celebrity-saturated, ethnically mixed and behaviorally volatile
society it has become. His gentle semiautobiographical novel
``World's Fair'' (1985), which he has called ``a portrait of the
artist as a young boy,'' was set in the Bronx in the 1930s. ``The
Book of Daniel'' (1971) dealt with the radical politics of the
1960s within a fictional account of the time by the son of a couple
based on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. His recent book ``The
Waterworks'' (1994) was something of a detective story set in 1870s
New York, involving a missing newspaper reporter and an evil
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   If a theme runs through them all, it is the past as progenitor
of the present. The persistent suggestion of Doctorow's fiction is
this: From there, we got here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you set a book in the past, you're inevitably writing
about the present,'' Doctorow said in a recent interview on the
campus of New York University, where he is teaching this semester.
</P>
<P>
   In his new novel, however, his 10th, he has taken a reverse
tack. Set in the present, again in New York City, which it uses as
a teeming representation of the modern world, the book looks back
on the 20th century, probing the circumstances of its three main
characters _ a priest, a rabbi and a writer _ in such a way that
the weight of history is brought to bear on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Narrated in an experimental mode, with a jumpiness meant to
mimic what Doctorow calls the attention deficit disorder that
afflicts the entire culture, the novel has a brazen millennial cast
that is evident in the title: ``City of God.'' And its bravado has,
perhaps predictably, polarized critics. Writing in The New York
Times, Michiko Kakutani called it a ``novel of ideas that may be
packed with ideas but that fails as a satisfying work of fiction.''
In Newsweek, Peter Plagens wrote that it all hangs together
``brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``City of God'' focuses its jittery eye on many things _
birds, the Holocaust, the poetry inherent in song lyrics,
cosmology, the movies and adultery, to name a few. But its central
subject is the search for faith in a dangerous and cacophonous age.
Recapitulative, with a sense of conclusive authority, it addresses
more directly than his previous novels the nature of contemporary
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said to me once that my books can be arranged in rough
chronological order to indicate one man's sense of 120 years of
American life,'' Doctorow said. ``In this book, it seems I've
finally caught up to the present. I've been very slow about it, but
I finally made it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 69, a man of wry and avuncular mien dressed in dapper
professorial mode, he was speaking in his characteristic fashion, a
soft, insistent voice with a hint of conspiratorial invitation. Yet
he was also hesitant, as if, because of the novel's spiritual
subject matter, he felt shy. A Jew, his own spiritual inquiry is
mirrored, he said, in that of one of the book's leading characters,
a woman rabbi, ``but I like to think that, finally, religion is a
private matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there is a wicked side to the novel; it ends with an
emotionally and intellectually fraught mixed-faith wedding and
includes a toast, a challenge to God, really, that also seems
likely to challenge readers who have the delicate sensibilities of
the traditionally devout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do You not find it an unforgivable lapse of Yours,'' the
bridegroom says, with a raised glass, in one of his tamer
locutions, ``that after these thousands of years we can no more
explain ourselves than we can explain You?'' Doctorow seemed ill at
ease at the suggestion that the wedding, the novel's climactic
event, was planned provocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never ducked controversy,'' Doctorow said. ``Why would
any writer do that?'' What worries him, though, he said, is that
viewing the book as merely inflammatory is to diminish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as a big kitchen sink of a book, with a lot of
surprises and riffs and all sorts of things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding speech, he said, ``is just a portrayal of hell. The
book turns out to cover a kind of struggle for faith, a spiritual
crisis of one sort or another of these two people, both of whom are
historically aware. And I don't think people who are secure in
their faith can feel anything but compassion for this sort of
struggle, which many people have gone through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also feel that an enormous number of people, perhaps most of
the people in this country, partake of both ways of thinking and
being without ever landing in one way or another. A lot of the
Judeo-Christian ethic is now instilled in civil life. It is
possible for people who are not particularly pious to live just as
ethically as people who are pious. As far as a critique of
traditional religion, that's nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   The structure of the novel is complex. The narrative takes the
form of a writer's notebook in which Everett, the protagonist (
Doctorow has frequently created a creator to narrate his tales)
records observations and ideas of all kinds _ the scattered life of
his mind. In search of a subject for his own new novel, Everett
reads a newspaper account of how a large cross was stolen from an
Episcopal church in Lower Manhattan and placed, ostensibly by the
thieves, on the roof of a small synagogue on the Upper West Side.
Neither the motive nor the perpetrator of what Everett calls ``the
heist'' is ever uncovered (the mystery hovers symbolically through
the book) but as he investigates the case, Everett befriends Pem,
the church rector, and the synagogue's two young rabbis, who are
husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories begin to take shape in Everett's notebook, along
with meditations on the origins of the universe; ideas for movie
scripts; descriptions of sexual affairs; recollections of
bird-watching expeditions; monologues in the voices of, among
others, Wittgenstein and Einstein; biographical sketches, in
faux-Homeric verse, drawn from his family's experiences in the
century's wars; jazzlike improvisations on the lyrics of popular
song standards; even a comic fantasy about a frustrated former
reporter for The New York Times (``ex-Times guy,'' Everett calls
him) who seeks murderous justice for unpunished war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, Doctorow said, is ``not only a writer, he's kind of an
Everyman.'' He continued: ``In his mind is the cultural detritus of
all minds, the controlling ideas of the culture that are in
everybody's mind. He has certain preoccupations he comes back to.
He's a bachelor and lives a life of his own appetites and
interests. But the wonderful thing I discovered is that all these
free-ranging themes, these leitmotifs, all of them relate to the
central quandary caused by the mystery of the missing cross.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the stolen cross came to him, Doctorow said, long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have been in a church for some reason, someone had
died, or I was participating in a panel, and I saw a large brass
cross behind the altar,'' he said. ``Someone had recently painted
the church _ it was somewhere in the city _ and it had not been
done well, and there was a kind of shadow, an outlining around the
parts of the cross, and I imagined, `What if the cross were taken
down? You could still see the shadow.' It was from that image I was
able to create Pem.''
</P>
<P>
   The story stands as an illustration of how Doctorow's novels
grow. It is an organic thing, as he describes it, the channeling of
subjects that interest him through the searching voice of a
fictional persona. Never an exhaustive researcher (``I stand by the
fallibility of Everett's research,'' he said of the science and
history in ``City of God,''), he concocts his worlds from the
probing of imagination. That one theme of the book is the artist as
a God-like figure is not accidental; it jibes with the idea that
God's earth is not entirely within his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every act of creativity is a puny human imitation of grand
Creation,'' Doctorow said. And if ``City of God'' deals with
profound issues provocatively, that wasn't the point, he added,
merely the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever begin a book with a grand intention,'' he said.
``Or any intention. I write to find out what I'm writing. Before
you do anything, you have to find a voice, a diction that makes
certain things possible and some things not. This fellow Everett,
and his daily work habits, and his attraction, he doesn't know why,
for these religious people allowed me to find this subject, this
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``It's starting from some private excitement,
usually having to do with language and trying to discover what is
so evocative about it. What's so evocative about a stolen cross
being found on the roof of a synagogue? And you've got this person,
and he's got all kinds of problems, his own interests and
ambitions, he's living a profane life and he attaches himself to
these righteous people. You don't find yourself asking, `Do I
deserve to talk about these issues?' You find yourself asking, `How
can I make this work?'''
</P>
<P>
   Doctorow warmed to his discourse; he had found the way to talk
about his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I found here was this book mimics the rhythm of the mind
as we have it today,'' he said. ``We're all hopping around buzzing
from information. The whole culture is full of that. If I write a
book that gets its tension from discontinuities, I've found a
template for the way we're thinking. When I find Everett doing
riffs on song lyrics, that makes me happy. In fact, songs are
immensely powerful things in our culture, and it turns out as I'm
doing this, all these things, these seeming discontinuities,
converge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes to the hospital at the end, and they're sitting, the
dying people, singing standards, waving their hands in time to the
music. Well, you discover the popular song is the equivalent of a
hymn in what is basically a secular culture, with the same ideals,
the same romantic possibilities of real life and real love that you
find in the hopes and pieties of hymns.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the novel, he recalled, Everett puts a monologue
in the voice of Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he has Sinatra say, `Here is the whole world falling
apart, Hitler is killing Jews, Stalin is killing Russians, the
Japanese are beheading Chinese coolies, the whole world is pouring
blood, and here I am singing in my bel canto.'''
</P>
<P>
   Doctorow smiled. ``Speaking of offending people,'' he said, ``I
think I'm more likely to offend true Sinatra fans.''

MAKING BOOKS: OF LOYALTY OR ROYALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It often happens that an author who has produced a best seller
(or a near best seller) for a small publishing house immediately
jumps to a big publisher for the next book.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing is an ambulatory business, with the players popping
from house to house, but upon first reflection the vigorous
desertion of writers from the publishers who have propelled their
career seems _ even nasty. But is this disloyalty, or does the
getaway serve a very understandable self-interest? Do you have to
leave the dance with the one who brought you? It's an old debate in
publishing. Writers have frangible careers, publishing is a harsh
business, and it seems only fair that they follow the cash when
that decision is most comfortable for them. Perhaps the role of the
small publisher is to discover and create careers, particularly
those of fiction writers.
</P>
<P>
   What brings this to mind is Susan Vreeland's ``Girl in Hyacinth
Blue,'' a concise novel that follows the influence of what may have
been a lost Vermeer portrait on several generations of lives
starting in present day America and hurtling back to the
17th-century Netherlands. Vreeland's agent, Barbara Braun, said it
was originally rejected by about 15 New York publishers before it
was bought for an insignificant $5,000 advance by MacMurray &AMP; Beck,
a small Denver publishing house, which put it out it in December
with a first printing of 8,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   There are now about 40,000 hardcover copies in print, and the
novel is on the extended best-seller list of The New York Times and
is being sold in eight countries. Meanwhile, Vreeland has left her
publisher, having been trawled in for two new books with a
mid-six-figure advance from Viking (for hardcover rights) and
Penguin (for softcover), both of which were among the 15 that first
shunned her. In fact, Penguin had an epiphany about the merit of
``Girl'' and bought the paperback rights for $55,000. (Viking and
Penguin are imprints of Penguin Putnam Inc.)
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Koffler, editorial director of MacMurray &AMP; Beck, said:
``I don't enjoy it, but it is a small press reality, and authors
must do what's best for them. We probably can't compete on the same
level as a larger house.'' Compete is not only about cash for
advances, but also about the drapery of distribution, marketing,
advertising and public relations that must fold around a book for
it to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Vreeland has nothing but praise for MacMurray &AMP; Beck _ ``They
had faith in me when I was an unknown writer'' _ and most
particularly for its publisher, Fred Ramey, and editor, Greg
Michalson, both of whom resigned recently. Vreeland said that ``one
of the features I will miss is the tremendous marketing and public
relations people at MacMurray.'' Anyway, she said she was fearful
that MacMurray &AMP; Beck would be sold. The more likely outcome is
that Penguin Putnam, ever on the lookout for rainmakers, will hire
Ramey and Michalson.
</P>
<P>
   Jane von Mehren, the associate publisher of Penguin, who
gathered in Vreeland, said: ``Smaller houses are wonderful at
establishing new writers, sometimes better than bigger houses
because they have smaller lists to focus on. But there's that
moment that an author, to keep growing, has to jump to a big
publisher for better distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always on the lookout for writers that we can grow,''
she said. ``Or looking at books that have never been published or
for writers previously published by someone else.'' Perhaps
predatory, but nonetheless mostly author-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   There are writers who want to stay at small houses, even after
they have written best sellers. In 1995, Walker &AMP; Co., a small New
York City house, published Dava Sobel's ``Longitude,'' a
60,000-word book about the invention of the chronometer. It turned
out to be a joyous yet thoroughly perplexing publishing experience.
It was on the best-seller lists of The Times for a total of 41
weeks. It was Book One of a two-book deal, for a total advance of
about $25,000. The second book was ``Galileo's Daughter,'' which
spent 18 weeks of The Times' hardcover nonfiction list. Both books
have been optioned for the movies. Meanwhile Sobel has been
borrowed by von Mehren to write ``The Planets'' for an advance in
excess of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   I say borrowed because the writer and her agent, Michael
Carlisle, would like to remain with George Gibson, publisher of
Walker &AMP; Co. If possible, that is. Sobel said: ``People say that
now that you've had these big successes you could go anywhere else.
With `Galileo's Daughter,' George didn't think it was right. He had
me rewrite it. It took a whole extra year. He was right. I feel
strongly that at a big house they would have pressed me to get it
out anyhow, because people were expecting it.''
</P>
<P>
   So the question is how big a risk she is willing to take to stay
with a small publisher. Gibson said that a $100,000 advance was the
largest he has given at Walker, but he indicated that he would go
higher to hold Sobel after ``The Planets.'' But seven figures? For
Sobel the risk of returning to Walker is giving up a huge advance
at the start in the hope that the book will leap onto the
best-seller lists when it is finished and she will earn the big
money then. It's a gamble she's willing to take. ``You get the
money later, rather than sooner,'' she said. ``For me, what matters
is who you work with and what the relationship is.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually to do this, a writer must have an agent who supports
the leap of faith, since agents, quite naturally, like to see as
much cash as possible, and quickly. But in Carlisle, she does. He
said: ``The experience she has had with George Gibson has not only
been extraordinarily remunerative and supportive, but it's been for
her like the old-fashioned enjoyable publishing experiences. I
don't win bragging rights for selling two books for so little
money, but what's been important is that George published her as if
he had spent a lot of money. Here's a man who drove six hours in
the middle of the night to make sure she had a pile of books at a
book signing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle added that ``it works as long as she is writing best
sellers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are authors who have gone from large to much smaller
houses, although most of the time the author who hits it big with a
first book published by a small house feels the need for the
security and the money that the bigger house provides. So in book
publishing, it's not a gauche or even stupid to go home from the
dance with a stranger.

 &HT;    Indians still reeling from cyclone's punch
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ERSAMA, India _ Fourteen-year-old Kailash Swain watches intently
as the villagers of Jappa celebrate for the first time in four
months. It is a small festival to honor Sarna, a Hindu goddess of
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Children and saffron-clad priests wend past damaged mud huts,
fallen palms and stagnant pools of water. Kailash's gaze falls on
the flower-adorned picture of Sarna. He wants to go to school, but
he knows he will probably have to set his dreams aside and work the
land instead.
</P>
<P>
   The second of two powerful cyclones last October brought 165-mph
winds to Jappa and the rest of coastal Ersama district in the
eastern Indian state of Orissa. At least 10,000 people died; 7
million more were left homeless. In Jappa, the cyclone made orphans
of Kailash and his three younger siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things will never be like before, but what can I do?'' Kailash
said.
</P>
<P>
   Choice is no longer a part of many people's lives in
cyclone-ravaged Orissa. India's worst storm of the century changed
the face of the state for years to come and left the poorest of the
country's poor with nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Atlanta-based relief and development agency
CARE USA, the state's cash crops _ coconut, papaya and betel nuts,
which are chewed as a stimulant _ suffered millions of dollars in
damage. Rice paddies were swept away by the wind or rotted
underwater a month before harvest. More than 40,000 fishing
families lost their boats and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one thing on everyone's minds these days, and
that is our next meal,'' said farmer Kedar Kuanar. ``We were
dependent on our rice paddies, which were totally destroyed. We
have no housing, no schools _ everything collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell it has been four months since death and
destruction came ashore Oct. 29. Aid workers say the recovery
process has been further hampered by government bureaucracy and
inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Entire villages, including Jappa, still lie flattened. Dried up
palm fronds and mangled trees line the roads. Among the patches of
still standing greenery are smatterings of blue tarpaulins handed
out by relief agencies to act as roofing on the skeletons of mud
huts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still struggling. They are struggling very much,''
said Orissa's CARE director, Basant Mohanty, who traveled to
Atlanta and other U.S. cities in December to appeal for money. ``We
are facing so many logistical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no mercy for Ersama, just south of the super-cyclone's
landfall. The high gusts of winds were followed by a tidal wave
that rose to 20 feet. People saw family members and neighbors fly
through the air or be washed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mental ward in the Cuttack hospital doubled in size after
the cyclone,'' said Girish Swain, one of CARE's relief workers.
``Some people hoot like the first sound of the wind they heard.
Others saw their parents die in front of them. The damaged
infrastructure can be rebuilt, but what about all these people who
went mad?''
</P>
<P>
   Salt left by the tidal wave destroyed soil in the rice paddies
and slowed decomposition of human bodies, making the cleanup more
gruesome.
</P>
<P>
   Decomposing corpses still lie in the fields and ponds of Ersama,
said Narayan Panigrahy, an aid worker with the Indian relief agency
AWARE. ``The government says 10,000 people died in the Orissa
cyclone. I think 15,000 died in Ersama alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up contaminated watering holes and rebuilding
infrastructure are part of CARE's rehabilitation program to help
the 15 million Orissans affected by the cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   On an ominously cloudy day, 500 of Ersama's villagers gathered
to rebuild a damaged road. The project was part of CARE's food and
work program, through which cyclone victims volunteer labor in
exchange for supplies such as cooking oil and a blend of cornmeal
and soya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following disaster situations such as the cyclones in Orissa,
people's suffering and rehabilitation efforts crucial to recovery
continue long after the media interest fades,'' said Bob Laprade,
who oversees CARE's programs in Asia and Europe from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The once-proud fishermen and rice farmers picked away at
Ersama's red clay with axes. They said they were fortunate to be
able to return home with food tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``How our life has changed!'' said farmer Kuanar. ``We were
poor, but earlier we had so many resources at hand. Now, we get by
with one meal a day. We go out of our villages looking for kinds of
work we have not ever had to do before.''
</P>
<P>
   Jillani Khan is lucky that he already had a job as a hotel
worker in Orissa's capital, Bhubaneswar. His $13 monthly salary is
all his wife and children have now for survival. He can no longer
depend on the fruits of his land for income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am scared now of another natural calamity,'' Khan said.
``It's pointless thinking about what happened. But I am scared of
rebuilding. What if I lose it all again?''BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Village leaders were eager to talk to the CARE workers who
showed up at the road building site.
</P>
<P>
   As they huddled around CARE's Swain, a 70-year-old woman pushed
through the crowd, tears disappearing into the folds of her dark
cheeks. She wiped her face with the end of her turquoise blue
cotton sari.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man I adopted as my son took away my ration card. I have
no food, nothing to eat. I have to beg for my food,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sodari Sethi used to launder clothes to barter for food. Now, no
one can spare her anything or has time to deal with her problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mob culture here these days. It's definitely survival
of the fittest,'' Swain said. ``And the people who need it the most
don't always receive the aid. The guy living in the concrete house
will get a floor mat just as easily as the guy forced to live in a
collapsed thatch hut.''END OF OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Ersama villagers have one hope: that this year's monsoons will
rinse away the salt in the earth and replenish the greenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that God will provide,'' said Kuanar.
``Otherwise, we will be no more.''

   PlayStation 2: Catching Next Wave From Japan
</P>
<P>
   The new Sony PlayStation 2 game console, introduced last week in
Japan, has already sold more than a million units there and is
expected to be equally popular when it reaches the United States
this fall, despite a list price of nearly $400.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its highly advanced 3-D graphics capabilities, its
ability to play DVD movies with surround-sound output and its
broadband-ready Internet connections, the PlayStation 2 is also
backward-compatible with thousands of existing Play-Station game
titles.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, each new generation of game console was
incompatible with the previous one, leading to a scarcity of new
game titles and a flood of older consoles and games at local garage
sales. With PlayStation 2, consumers will be able to keep their
favorite first-generation PlayStation games while building a
collection of new games that take advantage of the new console's
powerful graphics features.
</P>
<P>
   Eager game players in the United States are already trying to
smuggle the Japanese consoles into the country, even though they
cannot play Region 1 (North American) DVD discs without serious
unauthorized tinkering with the DVD copy protection system.
</P>

   Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp., which used to be the second-largest
software company in Redmond, Wash., before overtaking Nintendo, is
preparing to announce Friday its own game console, whose code name
is X-box. Details are scarce, but sources say the X-box will
feature an Advanced Micro Devices Athlon processor and an nVidia
3-D graphics card.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's bid to enter the game console market with its X-box,
which is not expected to reach the market until the 2001 holiday
season, follows the software giant's apparently unsuccessful
attempt to establish Windows CE as an alternative operating system
for the Sega Dreamcast game console last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sega says it has sold more than 1.5 million Dreamcast systems so
far, but software developers prefer Sega's own proprietary
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PlayStation 2 is the most powerful product ever introduced
to the consumer market,'' said Richard Doherty, director of
Envisioneering Group, a technology consulting company in Seaford,
N.Y., who described its 3-D graphics capabilities as the equal of a
$20,000 Silicon Graphics workstation vintage 1997. He also said the
new PlayStation is so popular that thieves are ambushing Japanese
teenagers when they emerge from stores carrying the new game
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo is preparing to introduce its own high-end console,
code named Dolphin, later this year. The Dolphin system is expected
to include a PowerPC G4 microprocessor and a DVD drive, and like
the PlayStation 2 it will also sell for about $350.

   The Greatest Thing Since, Well, Since Refrigeration
</P>
<P>
   With all the buzz about how the Internet is changing Life as We
Know It, it's nice to see things from a different perspective every
once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy reality check is provided at greatachievements.org, a
listing of the 20 greatest engineering achievements of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The project was a joint effort of about 30 professional
engineering societies, led by the National Academy of Engineering,
and the Top 20 were selected by a committee of leading engineers
from industry and academia. Each listing links to both a historical
overview and a time line showing significant developments over the
course of the century.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Internet ranked 13th on the hit parade,
behind such worthy developments as electrification (No. 1), the
automobile (No. 2), the airplane and the telephone. But Net
aficionados may be dismayed to learn that their favorite ranked
below air conditioning and refrigeration, and barely above home
appliances, on the list.

   A Digital Camera That Will Fit Palm III and Upgrade Esteem
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the Palm III organizer have been known to be a little
envious of colleagues who have upgraded to its more expensive
cousin, the V. After all, the III looks a little pedestrian in its
gray plastic shell, while the V is encased in sleek anodized
aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   But this spring, Palm III owners will have something to be smug
about. That's when Kodak's PalmPix goes on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPix, which will sell for about $179, will turn a III
into a digital camera. It simply slides onto the bottom end of the
Palm, connecting through the organizer's HotSync slot.
</P>
<P>
   The device has a fixed-focus lens, a 2X digital zoom and a
timer. Pictures show up as grayscale images on the Palm's screen,
but when loaded onto a PC they can be viewed as full-color
640-by-480-pixel images _ decent quality, though not as good as the
images on a megapixel camera. Users can also beamed images from one
Palm to another, providing a novel way to show off pictures of
children or pets.
</P>
<P>
   While stored in the Palm, each image occupies about 100
kilobytes, meaning that the basic 2-megabyte Palm might be able to
hold 10 to 15 photos, depending upon how much other data is stored
in it.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPix will be available within the next few months, online
at www.kodak.com/go/shop and at computer retailers. As of now,
there is no PalmPix for the Palm V. Unfortunately for the
self-esteem of III owners, however, the camera will work with the
wireless Palm, the VII. &QL;

   Mac Users Can Now Say `I Love You' Out Loud
</P>
<P>
   Not only are some of the major video game makers coming back to
the revitalized Macintosh platform, but productivity software is
also appearing on the once-dusty store shelves in the Mac section.
IBM's ViaVoice for Mac software, a continuous speech recognition
program, allows members of the Apple corps to freely dictate their
thoughts and have the computer do the typing.
</P>
<P>
   Continuous speech recognition programs, those that allow the
user to speak in natural rhythms and not pause uncomfortably after
every word, have been making the lives (and hands) of PC users less
stressed for years, but a similar product for the Mac was not
available until the ViaVoice program was released a few months ago.
A version of the program is also available for PC users.
</P>
<P>
   ViaVoice for Mac includes a 260,000-word dictionary and will
analyze the user's speech patterns for the best recognition
accuracy. Material dictated into the program can be easily
transferred into popular Mac word-processing programs like
AppleWorks and Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   A headset microphone that can color-coordinate nicely with the
distinctively fruity iMac shades is included with the software.
ViaVoice for Mac runs on Macintosh Power PCs with Mac operating
system 8.5.1 or higher, at least a 233-megahertz processor and 48
megabytes of RAM. The program needs 200 megabytes of free hard
drive space and has a street price of around $90.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, take note: In addition to taking dictation, the program
can also use the Mac's native text-to-speech function to recite
text displayed on the screen _ so it may not just be the kids
talking back anymore. &QL;

   Deja Vu All Over Again For New Deja.com Site
</P>
<P>
   Deja.com is restarting again. Do you ever get that feeling of,
well, you know?
</P>
<P>
   When it first opened years ago, Deja.com was designed primarily
as a Web-based search engine for messages posted to Usenet
newsgroups. Last year, it revamped itself to become more consumer
friendly, remolding online discussion groups so that they appeared
to be dedicated to specific products. Now it has yet another face
lift _ and a new philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``User-generated content is valuable,'' said Tom Phillips,
Deja.com's president. ``But is it the whole story? Absolutely not.
It generally cannot be trusted in isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the discussion-group content might have been keeping
some visitors away. The number of pages viewed over the past year
had remained ``flat,'' Phillips acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The new Deja.com, which opened last week, is the company's
effort to provide consumers with a broader view of what they need
to know before buying something. The Precision Buying Service, as
the new service is called, still includes user ratings, but now
visitors can also pore over specifications for various products
(including side-by-side price comparisons), read industry reviews
and find links to online stores that offer the products in stock.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the spring, details on more than two million
products are expected to be available in the Deja.com database.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers who pay Deja.com will receive preferred placement on
some Web pages, but Phillips said Deja.com will also provide as
much information as possible about products that are not directly
helping Deja.com's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened to the oldest iteration of Deja.com, the
one with Usenet access? It now has its own site, which looks a lot
like its original form, at www.deja.com/usenet. &QL;

`GOD, THE DEVIL AND BOB': MORTAL BUMBLER TRIES TO SETTLE ETERNAL
CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>

York area. Please check local listings)

<TEXT>
<P>
   As God and the devil battle over an everyman named Bob Alman,
``God, the Devil and Bob'' thrusts one eternal mystery before us
with such insistence that it cannot be avoided. So, OK, why  &UR; does &LR; 
God look like Jerry Garcia? With his white hair and beard, T-shirt
and granny glasses, the resemblance is too blatant to be
accidental.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to figure out why this animated series has given God
the voice of James Garner. Wry, easygoing, reassuring, he is the
friendliest deity anyone could ask for. Alan Cumming, as the Devil,
slides from the onstage decadence of ``Cabaret'' into the great
tradition of English-accented villains from old Bible movies. With
his purplish face and horns, goatee and a black greatcoat, he is a
Goth alternative to the laid-back God. And French Stewart moves
smoothly from the bumbling alien Harry on ``Third Rock from the
Sun'' to the bumbling family man Bob. Yet this perfect casting only
proves that even God and Satan are nowhere without a good script.
</P>
<P>
   The series begins with a few promising, mischievous touches. God
and the Devil meet in a bar, where they choose Bob to prove that
the world is worth saving. A sign in hell reads: ``Tonight and
every night, Guy Lombardo.'' (If that doesn't scare you straight,
nothing will.)
</P>
<P>
   But before long, the rock-solid Bob has accepted his role and
all traces of mischief disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, I saved the world,'' Bob says as he walks in the door
one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not now, Bob,'' says his wife (Laurie Metcalf), displaying why
beneath its supposedly risky premise the series is just one more
benign and stale family sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, the Devil and Bob'' may look like a cartoon, but it never
takes advantage of the freedom to be outrageous that animation
offers. This Devil is even more of a bumbler than Bob. Even when
Satan takes the shape of a boy who wants to date Bob's 13-year-old
daughter (in a future episode), there is no conflict, just
groan-inducing punch lines. ``You are never to see that boy
again,'' Bob tells her. ``He is actually Satan in disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitched battle, in which evil doesn't stand a chance,
reveals the show's true reverence and the wrongheaded position of
the handful of stations that have refused to run it in prime time.
A station in Salt Lake City that will not carry it at all has also
refused to show ``Saturday Night Live,'' putting this little flap
in the category of fringe reactions that get way too much
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is that even for a sunny sitcom, the humor is
tired. In a future episode, God begins to tell Bob why evil exists,
but his voice is drowned out by a passing train. That joke was done
with more cultural savvy on ``South Park'' when Jesus, who has his
own talk show, was about to answer the same question, only to have
the television go full of snow and static.
</P>
<P>
   As for the God-as-Garcia look, the show's creators have said
that there is no specific reason behind it. Yet Thursday night when
God has to prove his identity to Bob, he morphs swiftly from Garcia
into the stereotypical picture of the Old Testament God merely by
growing his hair and beard longer and turning his T-shirt into a
robe. It seems that Jerry Garcia looked like God, not the other way
around, a mystery best left alone.

often the bedrock of efforts to win criminal indictments and

whether a jury believes the account of a patrolman who makes an
arrest, an undercover narcotics officer who buys drugs or a
detective who elicits a confession. Over the last six months in the
criminal courts of New York City, prosecutors say they are seeing a
change: grand jurors in Manhattan and Brooklyn are intensively
scrutinizing the testimony of police officers. And in Queens,
juries are deadlocking in an increasing number of cases, a sign,
prosecutors fear, that jurors are questioning the veracity of
police testimony. By David Rohde.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   It would seem, by this point, that everything that can possibly
be written about Lyndon Johnson would already be in print. Thanks
to Robert Caro and Robert Dallek and Merle Miller and a dozen other
biographers, we know all about LBJ's poverty-stricken Hill Country
childhood, his father's failed political career, his mother's
obsessions, the courting of Lady Bird, the questionable campaign
tactics, the congressional and Senate careers and, finally, triumph
and tragedy in the White House. Why another LBJ book?
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin Unger and Debi Unger, the former a Pulitzer Prize
winner for ``The Greenback Era,'' do have new things to tell _ or,
at least, some additional insights missing from previous Johnson
titles. Although their takes on Lyndon the child and LBJ the
president are mostly rehashings, ``LBJ: A Life'' focuses a lengthy
middle section on Johnson as Senate minority, then majority,
leader. Insights into how Johnson could balance partisan politics
with sensible compromise are fascinating. It would be hard for many
Americans to imagine, but Democrat Johnson and Republican President
Dwight Eisenhower saw themselves as a pragmatic team out to
accomplish everything possible for rank-and-file citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``LBJ: A Life'' is pricey at $30, and for casual LBJ scholars,
Merle Miller's ``Lyndon'' may be a more enjoyable one-volume study.
But if you're a history buff whose book collection houses a shelf
or two of Johnson lore, add this title. It will make a valuable
addition.

`WHICH LIE DID I TELL': TOP HOLLYWOOD SCRIBE TELLS ALL. REALLY.
HONEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the introduction to ``Which Lie Did I Tell?: More Adventures
in the Screen Trade'' William Goldman says that he was inspired to
write the book by a student at Oberlin College. He was visiting his
alma mater and talking to a group of students about Hollywood when
an intense young woman asked him, `` Goldman, Goldman, do you
always begin your second theme by page 17?''
</P>
<P>
   The question stunned him, he writes, ``because, you see, I
didn't know what a second theme  &UR; was &LR; .'' He goes on: ``I literally
did not know what language she was speaking ... But she made me
realize, truly she did, that I would have to write another book
about screenwriting,'' the first having been ``Adventures in the
Screen Trade: A Personal View of Hollywood and Screenwriting''
(1983). ``Because movies are not about second themes or about
dialogue or pretty stars. Because if screenplays are structure, and
they are, then movies are story.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe Goldman's new book really was inspired by the young
woman's question, although that gratuitous ``truly she did'' makes
you wonder. ``Which Lie Did I Tell?'' (which is what a
self-important producer once asked to demonstrate his candor) is
certainly full of practical advice for the aspiring screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   In telling a story, enter it ``as late as possible,'' he keeps
reminding you. Dialogue is nothing, structure is everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great truths of the movie business is that movies
are  &UR; fragile &LR; ,'' he writes. ``And even the most successful are only
a step away from disaster. Every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to protect your writing time,'' he advises. ``The
easiest thing to do on earth is not write.''
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, Goldman illustrates his advice with compelling
stories about the films he has worked on. For instance, to show the
importance of not overburdening the audience with too many major
characters he tells how he went about streamlining the plot of
David Baldacci's novel ``Absolute Power'' by building up the
character of Luther Whitney, the master thief, played by Clint
Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the risks of overexplaining a character
(``Hollywood heroes must have  &UR; mystery &LR; ,'' he says), he spells out
the damage done when the professional hunter Remington in ``The
Ghost and the Darkness'' acquired a past.
</P>
<P>
   And he uses his experience with the screenplay of Stephen King's
novel ``Misery'' to make a variety of points, from the risks of too
graphic violence (in the novel the writer's feet are cut off; in
the film his ankles are merely broken) to the need of a relatively
unknown actress, as Kathy Bates was at the time the film was made,
to play an unpredictable madwoman like Annie Wilkes.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Goldman sprinkles his text with amusing, somewhat
pointless anecdotes, like the one about his obsession with the
shortness of many movie stars and his stalking of Sylvester
Stallone to learn he is only 5 feet 7. Or the one about a time he
spotted Greta Garbo in Manhattan accompanied by a woman wearing an
eye patch, and he asked the friend he was with, ``Did you see
that?,'' and the friend responded, ``Yes, wow, a lady with an eye
patch.''
</P>
<P>
   The real problem with Goldman's story of being spontaneously
inspired by the young woman's question is how closely ``Which Lie
Did I Tell?'' resembles ``Adventures in the Screen Trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessor, the new book includes many actual samples
of screenwriting, this time vignettes like the zipper scene from
``There's Something About Mary,'' which Goldman considers flat-out
the best film of 1998; the fake-orgasm scene from ``When Harry Met
Sally''; the morning-sickness scene from ``Fargo,'' among others,
and of course many samples from ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid,'' which Goldman still considers his best piece of work.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Adventures in the Screen Trade,'' this book includes an
original script by the author (it's perfectly dreadful) and
critical comments about it by various colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Like the earlier book, the new one is written in Goldman's
circus-poster language, full of italics and boldface type and
cliches and grotesquely mixed metaphors; it reads as if it had been
dictated, transcribed and only cursorily read over (``Tony Hopkins
came next. For me, along with Morgan Freeman, the two best actors
of the era.'')
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Goldman shows you the difference between being a
screenwriter and a writer, and that while he may be skilled at the
difficult art of visualizing a telling scene, he is uncomfortable
setting down expository prose. Once again, the bundle of
resentments of directors, producers, critics. Once again, about
himself (sometimes referred to as moi) the overweening modesty.
</P>
<P>
   At least the new book is no worse than its predecessor. Film
sequels ``are whores' movies,'' Goldman writes. ``And always will
be. . . . The pulse of what we write  &UR; then &LR;  is always this:
creative. The pulse for a sequel is always this:  &UR; financial &LR; . So
they are never of a similar quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing ``Which Lie Did I Tell?'' isn't a film.

   UNITED NATIONS _ UNICEF began a global campaign Wednesday
against acts of homicidal violence against women who live in
cultures where laws and society fail to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   A a number of organizations are focusing on the issue as they
meet in New York for two weeks to assess progress five years after
the largest international gathering of women _ from the grass roots
to governments _ assembled in Beijing to share their hopes and
grievances. They refer to the issue as culturally sanctioned
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a violence that is almost sanctioned,'' said Carol
Bellamy, the executive director of UNICEF. The campaign will focus
on such acts as ``honor killings,'' dowry deaths, female
infanticide and acid attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, even when laws defending the right of men to
use violence against women are repealed, the culture that created
them continues to exert a tremendous influence over behavior, these
groups say. The situation is worst across a swath of countries
stretching from the Mediterranean to the edge of Southeast Asia,
especially Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's violence everywhere, there's gender discrimination
everywhere,'' said Bellamy. ``But South Asia _ when we assign
people there they come back raving feminists in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. agencies and thousands of local organizations from scores
of countries have found, their leaders say, that the path toward
better lives for the world's most oppressed women leads inevitably
into a collision with laws that favor men. And they contend that it
may explain why some countries never develop to their full
potential
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the violent attacks on women are technically
illegal. But some recent information compiled by UNICEF, with the
help of grass-roots organizations, indicates that they continue to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   They found that in Bangladesh, reported acid attacks on females
_ often by males they had rejected _ rose from 47 disfiguring
assaults in 1996 to more than 200 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In India, more than 6,000 ``bride burnings'' or other dowry
deaths were reported in 1997. The women died because they did not
bring what in-laws considered a satisfactory dowry or, sometimes,
because the groom was not happy with a bride chosen by his family.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1997, according to the most recent available
information, about 300 women in one province in Pakistan were
reported killed by relatives in the name of saving a family's
honor. India also has a version of ``honor crimes,'' as young
people from different Hindu castes, or caste Hindus and so-called
outcastes, may meet violence if they cross lines to marry.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, in its latest annual survey of human
rights, published Feb. 25, said that in India there are also
reported to be about 10,000 cases of female infanticide annually,
not counting an unknown number of abortions to avoid giving birth
to a girl.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ``UNICEF is a children's agency,'' said Bellamy, ``but you can't
deal with children without the implications of the parents,
particularly the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of child survival is already compromised if you're
talking about a mother who is malnourished in the first place. As a
child she's less well taken care of than a boy. She leaves school
early for early marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very often physically abused, and so much of that abuse
comes in the family. She doesn't get adequate prenatal care.
There's no obstetric emergency care. And we wonder why there's a
question of child survival.''

</P>
<P>
   Bellamy and other experts say that too much violent behavior is
excused in the name of culture and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's Health
Coalition and a former Ford Foundation representative in
Bangladesh, said the cloak of culture and religion enables many
societies to evade the issue of the misuse of unrestricted male
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of years, female genital mutilation came to
public consciousness and there was a sense of horror about it,''
Germain said. ``This year's topic seems to be honor crimes, and the
tendency to blame them on a particular religion, namely Islam. This
is not a religious phenomenon. It has to do with male dominance,
patriarchy and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinar Ilkkaracan, the founder of the Turkish organization Women
for Women's Rights, said in an interview here that sometimes the
West is too simplistic in holding religion responsible for women's
problems in Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ilkkaracan said many Muslim women consider it ultimately
unhelpful to hold religion responsible where a crime like ``honor
killing'' is involved.
</P>
<P>
   These deaths are condoned in Jordan, Palestinian areas, Lebanon
and eastern Turkey more often for traditional cultural reasons,
these women say, and to blame Islam invites a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Ilkkaracan, who has studied and campaigned against the high
level of these killings among rural tribal societies in eastern
Turkey, said she has had to tone down her work recently because it
was being portrayed by outsiders as an Islamic issue.
</P>
<P>
   She argues, in fact, that culturally sanctioned violence against
women is a Mediterranean phenomenon, and that even in Spain and
Portugal, it was unofficially condoned until those two countries
joined the European Union. The machismo of Latin America, she
contends, has its roots in the Iberian peninsula.

   In New York, Equality Now, which aids women's groups around the
world, is involved in a drive to lobby governments to re-examine
and rewrite or repeal laws that discriminate against women.
Equality Now publishes a booklet that quotes from the relevant laws
and lists the address of the head of state or government to promote
a letter-writing campaign to change discriminatory laws. The United
States, where citizenship laws can discriminate, is not exempt from
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Widyono, co-director of the group, says that women are
increasingly focusing on the international agreements and covenants
on human rights that governments have signed and then ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments made commitments in Beijing,'' she said. ``They
made them at the population conference in Cairo. They make them
over and over again. We are calling for accountability. The message
now is: sign a document and be accountable.''

 &HT;    Lowe's stores adds Alexander Julian home decor designs to
offerings
 &HT;    By Patti Bond

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lowe's Cos. is adding a trendy flair to its brightly
lit warehouse stores.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer has teamed up with designer Alexander Julian for a
home decor line. By summer, Julian's signature color schemes will
start popping up on wallpaper, paint, window treatments and floor
coverings at Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouses across the country.
In early 2001, Lowe's plans to add Alexander Julian cabinets and
countertops.
</P>
<P>
   Like Atlanta-based Home Depot and other home improvement
retailers, Lowe's is beefing up home decor to appeal to female
shoppers. Meanwhile, fashion designers have steadily expanded their
reach from consumer closets to the rest of the home.
</P>
<P>
   At Lowe's, Alexander Julian will join Laura Ashley's designer
products in paint, wallcovering and rugs. Beaulieu of America will
make Julian's licensed broadloom carpet, said Lowe's spokeswoman
Melissa Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's main designer labels in its warehouse stores are
Ralph Lauren paint and wallpaper by Raymond Waits and Carey Lind.
Most of the chain's home decor and designer brands are sold at the
Expo Design Center stores.
</P>
<P>
   The new designer line at North Wilkesboro, N.C.-based Lowe's
reflects a shift toward fashion and away from categories such as
consumer electronics. The Alexander Julian line is color-designed
to help consumers match a rug with draperies or paint, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to offer a solution-based approach,'' Simmons
said. ``A lot of people experience anxiety or confusion when
they're taking on a decorating project, and this will make it
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's tried a similar program in 1998 with designer Beverly
Murphy Home. The retailer dropped that program after testing it in
about 30 stores, Simmons said.

WHEN A SCREENWRITER TAKES CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Nouvelle Vague may have died quietly in the 1970s,
but its influence over French cinema lived on, above all in the
idea that young directors who aspired to be auteurs should write
their own screenplays. As a result few French cinephiles opted for
careers as screenwriters. Those who did depended on television for
regular work, and when they were hired for movies they received
little praise.
</P>
<P>
   Daniele Thompson was an exception. From an early age she watched
and learned from her father, Gerard Oury, a former actor turned
screenwriter and director of popular comedies. From 1966 she and
her father wrote 10 films that Oury directed. Along the way she was
also a co-writer of Jean-Charles Tachella's 1975 hit ``Cousin,
Cousine'' (for which she received an Oscar nomination) and more
recently of Patrice Chereau's ``Reine Margot.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the recognition, something was missing. ``I
considered my work important; I didn't have a chip on my
shoulder,'' she said in an interview, speaking in the fluent
English she picked up in New York while married to an Englishman
for much of the 1960s. ``But as a screenwriter you have no power.
When you see a director making a terrible mistake in casting or
editing, you just have to hope he's right.''
</P>
<P>
   So, at the age of 58 and after more than 30 years in the
business, she decided to write a screenplay for a first-time
director whom she could influence: herself. Her movie, ``La
Buche,'' a gentle comedy about family life, was well received by
French critics and the public here last fall.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Now, with screenings at the Walter Reade Theater in New York at
9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 4:45 p.m. on Sunday, it is one of 16
films in Lincoln Center's ``Rendezvous With French Cinema Today,''
which runs from March 10 through March 19.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``La Buche'' means ``Yule Log'' _ or ``Christmas Cake,'' as
Thompson has provisionally renamed it in the United States, though
she may still opt for a different English title. Either way, it
tells the story of a French family of Russian and Jewish extraction
who are thrown together by the social custom that Christmas be
celebrated as a family. Parents and children who may avoid each
other all year find themselves summoned to share turkey and yule
log. Everyone, it seems, experiences ``hostile depression.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the parents, Stanislas (Claude Rich) and Yvette
(Francoise Fabian), have not spoken since they divorced 25 years
earlier: Stanislas, who played the fiddle in a restaurant
orchestra, never forgave her for running off with a classical
violinist. Their three grown daughters nonetheless decide that
since Yvette is alone after burying her second husband, both she
and Stanislas should be invited to a Christmas Eve dinner given by
Sonia (Emmanuelle Beart).
</P>
<P>
   The three sisters, though, have their own complicated lives.
Louba (Sabine Azema), who sings in a Russian restaurant, is the
eldest and unmarried, although she has a long-running affair with a
married man, Gilbert (Jean-Pierre Darroussin). Sonia, the middle
sister, has everything _ two children, beautiful home, designer
clothes _ but her husband is planning to run off with his mistress.
Milla (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is the rebel: she despises Sonia's
bourgeois lifestyle but her moodiness makes it difficult for her to
find a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   In the countdown to Christmas, the women discover that their
father has allowed a young man, Joseph (Christopher Thompson, the
director's son), to live in a large converted storeroom in the
family house in exchange for doing odd jobs and repairs. Joseph
needs a place to stay after moving to Paris from southern France,
where he has left his wife and small child. But he has other
reasons for enjoying rent-free lodging chez Stanislas.
</P>
<P>
   In developing the family choreography that follows, Thompson has
naturally tapped her long experience of storytelling (and recruited
her son, Christopher, as a collaborator to provide an insight into
his generation). But she also is quick to acknowledge influences,
from Woody Allen and Pedro Almodovar to Chekhov. ``In Chekhov, all
the characters are so weak, so full of faults,'' she said. ``Yet
they evoke such sympathy. You feel such tenderness for their
weaknesses and their struggle to find a reason for happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Her own family background was also useful, not so much in
imagining the three daughters ( Thompson was an only child and her
parents divorced when she was 18), but in creating the character of
Stanislas. He was inspired by her maternal grandfather, Roman
Jacowlew, who migrated to France from Russia at the age of 14 and
went on to create a tzigane, or Gypsy orchestra, with 14 musicians
and one singer, his French wife. Michel Legrand's lively music for
``La Buche'' is also a homage to Jacowlew.
</P>
<P>
   Jacowlew divorced his wife in the 1930s and survived the German
occupation of France by hiding in another woman's house for five
years. His daughter, Jacqueline, an actress, fled to the unoccupied
south of France with her boyfriend, Oury, whose father was another
Russian immigrant violinist, albeit classical. Daniele was born in
Monaco in 1942, but her father did not formally recognize her for
fear that she would be identified as a Jew. After Germany occupied
southern France in 1943, the family escaped to neutral Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson addressed French attitudes toward Judaism in a 1975
film she wrote with her father, ``The Mad Adventures of Rabbi
Jacob,'' but she said she was not interested in dwelling on that
issue in ``La Buche.'' Almost the only reference is a sarcastic
remark by Stanislas about the anti-Semitism of Sonia's in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to base my story on that,'' she explained. ``The
film is about little secrets. I think lying is very much part of
family life. We lie to our children by hiding the professional,
sentimental and sex problems of the couple. Then, when our children
grow up, they start lying to us. Parents are the last to know a
marriage is in trouble. Families are made up of love and lies. We
often know more about the lives of our close friends.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So how does she like directing, having made a first film that
sold 1.5 million tickets in France and that won a Cesar, the French
equivalent of the Oscar, for Gainsbourg as best supporting actress?
</P>
<P>
   ``The new thing was that I had the power of decision,'' she
said, ``which I had never had before and which is a terrible
responsibility. In the past I would hope the directors were right;
now I hope that I'm right. I want to make another film. But I also
love the simple act of writing, of inventing situations and
dialogues. So I think I'll work on two screenplays, one for myself
and one for someone else, and do both at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   But she has another reason to feel upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're seeing the rehabilitation of the screenwriter,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after decades in which French directors routinely wrote
their own screenplays, Thompson is not the only screenwriter to
show it can be two-way traffic. Francis Veber, for instance, had a
hit in 1998 when he directed his own screenplay of ``The Dinner
Game.'' Agnes Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri, both also actors, have
written several successful films, including ``The Same Old Song,''
directed by Alain Resnais (one of the few French directors who has
always used screenwriters). And last week, Jaoui's first movie as a
director of her own screenplay, ``La Gout des Autres,'' opened here
to excellent reviews and full theaters.

   ``If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us

</P>
<P>
   As if the presidential primaries aren't painful enough, Jim
Hightower has chosen to inflict upon us ``If the Gods Had Meant Us
to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an awfully cute, but prolonged, title for what essentially
is 350 pages of what we already knew.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower is a former Texas agriculture commissioner who fancies
himself a populist commentator. For those new to Hightower, imagine
political commentary from Gomer Pyle sporting a ten-gallon hat on a
head that's a few quarts low.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes off as goofy leftist idealism, a terribly naive,
preachy mess that panders shamelessly to the liberal souls of
America.
</P>
<P>
   His messages: Our leaders are in bed with the big-money boys;
NAFTA and a global economy are bad; and we need to rise up, buck
the system and reclaim America.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all this comes from ``America's most popular
populist.'' It says so right there on the dust jacket of his
populist-priced $25 book.
</P>
<P>
   A populist, you recall, is someone who is looking out for the
``little guy'' and the ``working stiffs'' _ the kind of folks who
would be mightily insulted at the notion that they can't look after
themselves just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Look closer, and it is clear that Hightower is no populist. He
is a pro-labor liberal in denial. The worst kind.
</P>
<P>
   So this self-styled populist savior in a $500 Stetson is killing
trees to tell us that our presidential candidates are getting
contributions from ``the big boys on Wall Street''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, to borrow a quote from Jimbo hisownself: ``Golly
Pollyanna!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, now who out there didn't already know that you don't raise
$50 million for a run at the presidency with nickels and dimes from
schoolchildren and widow women? This is the system we have created.
Wall Street didn't do it to us.
</P>
<P>
   As for a global economy, this is a cold, hard reality. American
businesses are majority stockholders in foreign companies, and vice
versa. Hightower sees globilization as a step toward world
domination by the World Trade Organization. But his biggest gripe
is that the beneficiaries are ``the financial elite'' and not the
working stiffs he purports to represent, whether they asked him to
or not.
</P>
<P>
   The kicker is that, here in the midst of a booming economy,
Hightower wants nothing less than a new American Revolution to turn
back the political and economic clock to what he perceives as a
simpler, more honest and isolationist time when we worked the land
and sent Jimmy Stewart to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, this is simple-minded pap. .MDNM/ (Visit the

RESEARCH SHEDS LIGHT ON RECOVERY PERIOD AFTER SPECIES BECOME
EXTINCT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past 500 million years, there have been dozens of
episodes of extinction on the planet, the most famous being the
titanic event that swept away the dinosaurs. Scientists have
assumed that the time it takes for the living world to bounce back
is proportional to the damage done: More time should be required to
fill all of the earth's empty corners with newly evolved life after
gargantuan extinctions and less time should be required after a
more minor die-off.
</P>
<P>
   But in an entirely unexpected finding that has gotten the
attention of both paleontologists and conservationists, researchers
reported Wednesday that it takes a long time to recover from these
large-scale extinctions _ around 10 million years _ and more
intriguing, the recovery time appears to be the same, whether the
original destruction was one of the grander or one of the more
minor events.
</P>
<P>
   Many biologists say that by destroying tropical forests and
other habitats, humans are driving species extinct at an
accelerating rate that if unchecked will result in one of the major
extinctions in the earth's history.
</P>
<P>
   An ominous implication of the new research, some scientists say,
is that humans may already or will soon have destroyed enough
species that it will require a full 10 million years for the planet
to recover _ 20 times longer than humans have already existed and
longer than many scientists predict humanity itself is likely to
persist into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the new study will also prompt paleontologists to
rethink how life evolves after major extinctions _ events that have
played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of life.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Dr. James W. Kirchner, an earth scientist at the
University of California at Berkeley, and Dr. Anne Weil, a
paleobiologist at Duke University, appears Wednesday in the journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a surprise to everyone,'' said Dr. Douglas Erwin,
a paleobiologist at the National Museum of Natural History at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington. ``We're just at the
beginning of understanding biotic recoveries following
extinctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mike Foote, a paleobiologist at the University of Chicago,
said the paper would change how people looked at the fossil record,
adding, ``It's going to be seminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing statistical techniques from other areas of geology and
astrophysics, the researchers examined an enormous set of data
gathered by the late Dr. Jack Sepkoski, a paleontologist at the
University of Chicago. The data documents when new kinds of marine
animals first appear in the fossil record and when they disappear
or go extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists expected that with every additional species that gets
knocked out during an extinction, the longer the recovery should
take. What researchers found instead was that after extinctions,
big and small, it took about 10 million years for the proliferation
of new kinds of organisms to peak and then begin to tail off. The
decrease in the proliferation of new creatures is seen as a sign
that ecosystems have recovered and are so full of diverse life that
there is little opportunity left for new organisms.
</P>
<P>
   So unexpected was the outcome, Weil said, that when Kirchner
handed her the results, she said, ``Did you do that right?'' She
added, ``I made him do the analysis again while I was looking over
his shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the new study suggested that the evolutionary
rebuilding after an extinction might work differently than had been
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Many paleontologists had previously pictured extinctions as
being the equivalent of wiping the pieces off a chessboard. In such
a situation, though the pieces are gone, the spaces on the
chessboard, the place for a queen or rook _ or in nature, the niche
for an algae-eating fish or a long-lived evergreen tree _ are still
there, each simply needing to be refilled by a newly evolved
species.
</P>
<P>
   But the new study, Erwin said, suggests instead that ``when you
wipe the pieces off the chessboard, the size of the chessboard
shrinks.'' That is, with the loss of a species comes the loss of
opportunities for the existence of other organisms as well _ like
those that would make their living by preying upon or parasitizing
that organism.
</P>
<P>
   So when there are few types of organisms left after an
extinction, there are few opportunities for new species to evolve.
Each new kind of organism that does evolve creates more
opportunities for other species, and each of those, in turn,
creates more opportunities in a kind of positive feedback loop, the
dynamics of which may be setting the recovery clock at 10 million
years.
</P>
<P>
   While some scientists are predicting that humanity will not live
to see a recovery from the extinctions it has wrought, many
questions remain. It is difficult to compare modern-day extinctions
with those viewed through the lens of the fossil record. As a
result, scientists still do not agree on whether and when humanity
will have destroyed enough species to require a 10 million year
recovery, with some saying that point has already been reached, and
others predicting it will be anywhere from 50 years to a thousand
years or more in coming.
</P>
<P>
   But if diversity is what provides the fuel for the recovery from
any extinction, as the new work suggests, then in terms of a
practical application, Dr. E.O. Wilson, an evolutionary biologist
at Harvard University, said the message was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' Wilson said, ``is that we had better take
care to hold on to the biodiversity that still exists.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 23, sitting in a village in Afghanistan drinking salty
tea with a party of desert tribesmen, Robert Edison Fulton Jr.
asked for water. A boy ran into the road to get it, filling a jug
in a muddy puddle, then offered Fulton a cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about to drink,'' he said, pausing, ``when a polliwog
swam to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 91, Fulton still looks surprised. A white-haired man with
eyes as blue and clear as a spring, he sat on a recent afternoon at
his desk in his studio in a rehabilitated barn in Newtown, Conn.,
where he lives with his wife, Ann. He was reviewing photographs
that in effect review his life. The desert is there, frozen in
time; Fulton, an inventor, photographer and sculptor, is still as
restless as sand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, as a young architectural student, Fulton set out from
London on a motorcycle and circled the globe, visiting 20 countries
and traveling 40,000 miles, arriving home to his parents' apartment
in New York City on Christmas Eve, 18 months later. He filmed the
trip on a 35-mm camera that looked more like a sextant. He had six
flat tires. He ran out of gas only once, just outside Munich,
Germany. In Greece he passed a man with a rearview mirror bracketed
to his shoulder who was wearing a sign that said, ``Walking Around
the World Backwards!'' Achievement is relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Long Journey Home,'' a selection of stills from the 4,000
feet of film Fulton shot, is being published next month by August
Press. His first exhibition of stills, photographs and sculpture
opens at Exhibit A, at 160 Mercer St in New York, on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very nice, very complimentary,'' he said, with a modest
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton has taken to thinking his thoughts out loud lately, in
written mottos posted on the beamed walls of his barn. ``Home Is
Not a House,'' a placard behind him read. ``Home Is a Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Home is also the skies. A self-taught pilot, Fulton is the
inventor of Gunairstructor, a World War II fighter pilots' training
device that was a successful precursor of current flight
simulators. He is the father of the Airphibian, a flying car
developed in the 1940s and featured in Life and Time magazines. His
Skyhook aerial rescue system, based on British railway mailbag
pickups, was used by the military, covertly, during the Cold War to
retrieve espionage agents, and as a special effect in the 1965
James Bond film, ``Thunderball.'' It was employed last in the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor has devoted his time more recently to aerial
photography, flying his P-51 Mustang upside down to get the best
shots, and to his sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton said that he knew of no relation to either Edison or
Fulton but that they had impelled his destiny. ``With a name like
Robert Edison Fulton, you can't be scared about being an
inventor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If life is a puzzle, he has kept most of the pieces, in
cataloged boxes and shelves of numbered albums, and objects like
the polar-bearskin rug, his Uncle Chester's, that he played on as a
child, and his 1937 Stinson airplane, which he is rebuilding, like
an extinct moth, in a hangar down the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some leave home to see the world. Some see the world and make it
their home. Fulton's expedition in 1932, as naive as it was
spectacular, was the first leg of the route that shaped his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would ask me, `Don't you get homesick?''' he recalled
of those encountered everywhere around the world. ``The answer was
yes.'' Of crossing 600 miles of Turkish desert, sleeping on dirt
beneath the stars and being woken by the rustle of caravans
traveling in the cool of the night, he said, ``I came to the
conclusion that, by Jove, this was my home, this world. The whole
of it, regardless of where I was in it. I think that's a helpful
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, after a year of postgraduate study in a Bauhaus program
at the University of Vienna, the young architect, encouraged by his
father to go east instead of west in returning home, set his sights
on the architectural treasures of the Mediterranean, the Middle
East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He announced his plans at a dinner party in London. ``Oh, I'm
going to ride around the world on a motorcycle,'' he recalled
saying. ``You don't see much architecture through a steamship
porthole.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton stood in his Connecticut workshop recounting the story
next to the machine that took him. ``In those days, motorcyclists
were either policemen or bums,'' he explained. ``I wasn't a
policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   An older man at the party asked a series of questions. Impressed
with his enthusiasm, ``he called my bluff,'' Fulton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that he'd bought the Douglas Motorcycle Co. that
day,'' he said. ``He gave me the motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The motorcycle was refitted with an extra gas tank, a tool box,
a camera case and a steel underplate that protected the crankcase
(and concealed a .32-caliber Smith &AMP; Wesson revolver). Fulton
learned to ride it in two days and left town, a suitcase and a
straw sun helmet on a rack between his handlebars. With Greece on
the horizon, he jettisoned his evening clothes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fulton's introduction to the classical kingdom changed his plans
to photograph architecture. Sitting in the shade of the Acropolis,
watching visitors' shadows cast on its columns, ``I became aware of
the fact that architecture was only a reflection of people,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``My camera was smarter than I was,'' he said. ``The further I
went on the trip, the more it kept changing from pictures of
architecture to pictures of people. They moved. They were alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton traveled through Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, India, China
and Japan, on roads so rutted that the motorcycle stood on its own
when he got off, or roads so erased by dust or rain that he could
site the middle of nowhere easily by where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   In the Taurus mountains in Turkey, a man living in a rock hut
invited him to a game of backgammon, on an olivewood plank with
sticks and stones for pieces, over a meal of pomegranates and
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   In China, he watched a man with a goatee as long as a kite tail
having his head shaved by a barber. Over a bowl of food, an
onlooker in the curious crowd that Fulton attracted everywhere
translated the roadside restaurant's menu into English for him.
``Lumps of flesh, boiled in oil, with a sweet and sour taste,'' he
recalled. ``I realized I'd been eating that since London. We're all
basically very much the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton said that he was pleased to find that people were
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that in many cases people would greet me with a gun,''
he said. ``But as long as my wavelength was peaceful, I was
invariably treated like clan. They never shot at me _ that I know
of.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, he was hospitalized for jaundice. An Iraqi chieftain
was murdered in the next room by a rival, who had counted the
windows on the outside of the building to find him, and climbed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God the Arabs' math is good,'' Fulton said.
</P>
<P>
   And he did see architecture: from a 4,000-year-old Mesopotamian
temple, gnawed to ruin by the wind at the top and camels at the
base, to the Temple of Borobudur, in Java.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a robe at a writing desk in a Japanese country inn,
Fulton decided to go home, and to be there by Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   He cried when he kicked the stand on the motorcycle and crossed
his parents' Park Avenue lobby.
</P>
<P>
   If there were hardships, Fulton won't speak of them. Of
happiness, he recalled the daily luck of seeing a world about to
change forever with travel and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exploration is routine now,'' he said. ``It wasn't then. Ages
of ways of living and thinking were coming to a dramatic end.''
</P>
<P>
   At 91, it is possible to have been famous and forgotten, several
times over. The young partners, first-time publishers, who are
producing ``The Long Journey Home'' discovered Fulton last spring
through a benefit auction, to which he gave a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   With his adventurous trip, Fulton also proved to be a pioneer of
globalization, ``understanding the world, on a local level,'' he
said. It is not yet a place at peace, but Fulton said he hoped that
new abilities to communicate, like the Internet, would discourage
the suspicions he witnessed, and helped to dispel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was typical of the whole trip,'' he said, his voice sad
with hindsight. ``You would ask about the next village, and people
would say: `Oh, don't go there. Terrible people _ robbers,
thieves.' You would ask: `How do you know? Have you been?' And they
would say, `No, we've heard.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the next village,'' he explained, ``people would ask: `Who
are you? Where have you come from?' When you told them, they would
say, `Oh, terrible people _ robbers, thieves.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had heard,'' he said.

TAX EXPERT URGES TOUGHER PENALITIES TO DETER CORPORATE CHEATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tough penalties Congress enacted to discourage
abusive corporate tax shelters are so riddled with loopholes that
they fail to deter tax cheating by large companies, Congress' top
tax expert told the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During the first day of hearings on tax shelters and the use of
penalties and interest to discourage sham transactions, Lindy L.
Paull, chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation,
testified that ``there is not a meaningful penalty facing someone
who enters these transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   She called for tightening the penalties and also for imposing
penalties on professionals who prepare abusive tax returns for both
individuals and companies generally at least as high as those
imposed on taxpayers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony came as the proliferating use of sham transactions
by large companies to evade taxes is gaining attention on Capitol
Hill, which over the last five years has focused on tax cuts and
criticism of the IRS. The concern has been stirred not only by
abusive tax shelters but also by complaints by four large American
insurance companies about a legal loophole that lets property and
casualty insurers stop paying income taxes by moving their
headquarters to Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who is chairman of the committee,
described corporate tax shelters as a serious problem. He also said
he was worried that new laws sought by the Clinton administration
to crack down on sham transactions would give too much power to IRS
agents.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, whose hearings in 1997 and 1998 on abuses by the
IRS led to a reorganization of that agency, said he expected it
would take a long time for his committee to decide what, if
anything, to do about corporate tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   One witness dismissed the idea that corporate tax shelters were
a problem. Kenneth J. Kies, who was Paull's predecessor as the tax
committee's chief of staff, said research by his employer, the
PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm, found no evidence that
corporate tax shelters now were any different from those a decade
or more ago. He said statements by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.
Summers and other officials that abusive tax shelters were costing
the government billions of dollars a year were ``totally without
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Kies, whose firm is a leading promoter of corporate tax
shelters, including one that the Treasury closed last year after
declaring it a sham, said that a more serious problem was the taxes
owed by individuals and small businesses that the IRS failed to
collect.
</P>
<P>
   Paull and Jonathan Talisman, the acting assistant Treasury
secretary for tax policy, said they were troubled by the legal
loophole that allowed property and casualty insurers to stop paying
income taxes by moving to Bermuda. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of
New York, the ranking Democrat on the committee, mused about
whether ``we are entering an era of corporate expatriation'' with
companies moving their headquarters overseas to avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Paull and Talisman said their staffs were studying the Bermuda
tax shelter but had not yet figured out a way to have it closed
without creating other tax problems.
</P>
<P>
   These two witnesses and Peter L. Faber, a prominent New York
corporate tax lawyer, all described corporate tax shelters as a
serious threat to the income tax system, saying that the government
must halt them or contend with serious long-term revenue loss and a
breakdown of popular support for the income tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Faber said lawyers at his firm, McDermott Will &AMP; Emery in New
York, advised 50 of the top 100 corporations on tax matters and
were continually fielding questions about tax shelters being sold
by investment houses, the Big Five accounting firms and law firms.
</P>
<P>
   He said promoters of tax shelters often sold ``garbage'' to
chief financial officers, who are often not expert in tax matters
and who are increasingly inclined to buy these products over the
objections of company tax directors.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to testimony by Kies that the amount of corporate tax
revenue has been rising, except for last year when it fell 2.1
percent, Faber said: ``It is no answer to say that corporate tax
revenues are up or that they are a high percentage of corporate
profits. Were it not for corporate tax shelters they would be
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Faber and Paull both said they disliked the idea, promoted by
Talisman, of enacting into law the ``doctrine of economic
substance'' in tax matters. The doctrine, created by judges in tax
cases, holds that if a transaction has no purpose except to avoid
taxes it lacks economic substance and can be disregarded for tax
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress should tread cautiously'' in defining tax shelters by
statute, Faber said, adding that ``some aspects of the problem are
better dealt with by regulations and judicial doctrines than by
legislation.''

ADVERTISING: 2 AGENCIES REORGANIZE, 3 ENTER DEALS AND 2 ALIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been a spate of deals this week involving agencies and
companies that work with them, ranging from reorganizations to
acquisitions to affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson Partners in New York, an executive recruiter and
management consultant that specializes in advertising,
communications and marketing, is reorganizing to improve efforts to
find managers able to meet the challenges of the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson is reconfiguring by naming leaders for two new
divisions. Norman M. Sherman, 51, a longtime agency and media
executive, becomes president for North America, overseeing
operations of offices in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and New York.
Sherman has held senior posts at D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles,
part of the MacManus Group unit of BDM Inc., and was most recently
managing director at the Senior Network in Stamford, Conn., a
marketing services company focused on consumers age 50 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Peter J. Fitzpatrick, 41, becomes president for the
international division at Gunderson, after serving most recently as
human resources director for the international operations of the
American International Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our searches now are global, for people with global
expertise,'' said Steven G. Gunderson, chief executive at
Gunderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our traditional clients continue to grow,'' he added, ``and
the new players, the dot-coms, are looking for the same kind of
talent.'' Fitzpatrick noted that Gunderson had ``recently moved
executives from Singapore to New York, Taipei to North Carolina,
Chicago to Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   In another revamping, the FCB Worldwide unit of True North
Communications is combining its four offices in Southern California
to form a single agency with 300 employees and total billings of
$450 million from clients like Hilton, Mattel and Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harrington, 38, who had been executive vice president and
general manager at the FCB office in Costa Mesa, becomes president
at FCB Southern California, working with Scott Montgomery, 50, who
becomes executive vice president and executive creative director
after handling those duties for FCB Costa Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Also at FCB Southern California, Thom Miller, 51, who had been
executive vice president and general manager at FCB Los Angeles,
will be executive vice president and general manager, and Howard
Casavant, 47, who had been senior vice president and senior group
creative director at FCB Los Angeles, will be executive vice
president and senior group creative director.
</P>
<P>
   Thom McElroy, 38, who had been president and chief creative
officer at FCB McElroy in Newport Beach, will be president of that
operation as it becomes part of FCB Southern California. And Bob
Gale, 42, who had been senior vice president and group account
director for the FCB Field Service Network in Santa Ana, handling
Taco Bell, will retain those duties as the network becomes part of
FCB Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   FCB Southern California is seeking space in Orange County to
bring together the staff members who had worked at FCB Costa Mesa,
FCB Santa Ana and FCB McElroy. Employees at FCB Los Angeles will
move to the El Segundo area, where Mattel is based.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to acquisitions, Publicis SA in Paris bought DeWitt
Media in New York, a media services agency with 80 employees who
handle accounts with estimated billings of $400 million for clients
like Bacardi, BMW, Land Rover and the National Basketball
Association. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Gene DeWitt, 57, president and chief executive at DeWitt, will
become chairman and chief executive of a new U.S. division of
Optimedia International, the Publicis worldwide media planning and
buying network; the division will handle media duties for accounts
with estimated billings of $1.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second American acquisition by Publicis in a month,
coming after the purchase of Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis.
Publicis and a rival French agency company, Havas Advertising,
which last month acquired Snyder Communications in Bethesda, Md.,
are aggressively stepping up acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Hawkeye Communications in New York, an agency
that is forming a network of companies through a series of
acquisitions, is making another one. Hawkeye, started last year by
G. Steven Dapper, former chairman and chief executive of the Rapp
Collins Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, acquired the Ffwd
Group in London and Haddenham, England, for undisclosed terms.
</P>
<P>
   Ffwd, which stands for ``Fast forward,'' according to Dapper,
has three divisions specializing in database marketing and services
for e-businesses. It is the first Hawkeye acquisition outside the
United States. Colin Glossop, 41, chief executive at Ffwd, will
continue in that capacity as well as help Hawkeye expand further in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In another acquisition, Omnicom, based in New York, acquired
majority ownership of Millsport LLC in Stamford, Conn., a sports
marketing agency. Omnicom, which has owned 25 percent of Millsport
since 1996, acquired an additional 35 percent for undisclosed
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Millsport has 60 employees and clients like GTE and Visa.
Michael Birkin, 41, president at the Diversified Agency Services
division of Omnicom, joins the Millsport board.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Dentsu U.S.A. in New York, part of the Japanese giant
Dentsu Inc., formed a nonequity alliance with Oasis Advertising in
New York. The affiliation offers worldwide resources like research
to Oasis, which has 31 employees and billings estimated at $35
million from clients like Alitalia and Toyota.

 &HT;    Atlanta construction company acquires Las Vegas operation
 &HT;    By Tony Wilbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Beers Construction hopes to win big in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta construction company with offices downtown has
acquired W.E. O'Neil Construction Co. of Nevada and taken control
of its projects, office and employees. The new Las Vegas office is
the first that Beers completely owns outside the Southeast. Last
year, a joint venture involving Beers opened an office in Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as an opportunity in terms of people in the office
and the work,'' said C. Roland Vaughn III, chief marketing officer
at Beers. ``There's nothing that says we have to stay in the
South.''
</P>
<P>
   A subsidiary of Skanska USA, Beers is one of the most-known
contractors in Atlanta, where its blue signs are found across the
metro area. The company built landmarks such as 191 Peachtree
Tower, Bank of America Plaza, Four Seasons, Swissotel, the Georgia
Dome and Philips Arena. It also will build the new TrizecHahn
Office Properties' 20-story office tower and a $350 million
retractable-roof football stadium in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Beers acquired the Nevada division from O'Neil Industries of
Chicago, a 75-year-old firm that owns construction companies in
Chicago; Los Angeles; Golden, Colo.; Addison, Texas; Phoenix; and
Tucson, Ariz. Vaughn declined to disclose how much Beers paid for
the Las Vegas operation.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition gives Beers instant expertise in building huge
hotels with casinos and more than 1,000 rooms. Vaughn said the
company can now compete for major hospitality projects.
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase, Beers inherits the $15 million renovation
project of the 5,034-room and suites MGM Grand Hotel and Suites in
Las Vegas. The renovation, expected to be completed in late summer,
will give the rooms an art-deco look, MGM Grand spokeswoman Shelley
Mansholt said.

   WASHINGTON _ After a dramatic sweep of Democratic primaries by
Vice President Al Gore and a series of one-sided victories by
Governor George W. Bush in the biggest Republican primaries, the
two candidates lost no time Wednesday in turning their attention
toward the general election in November, laying out the outlines of
their electoral platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief rivals for the parties' presidential nominations,
meanwhile, were reported to be close to dropping out of the race.
Former Senator Bill Bradley lost to Gore in every Democratic
contest on Tuesday, even in his native Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona had more to show from the
coast-to-coast Republican contests.
</P>
<P>
   He defeated Bush in the New England states of Vermont,
Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. But his aides had
counted on victory in New York or Ohio, the biggest contests
Tuesday after California, to revive his flagging fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush won by close to 20 percentage points in California
and Ohio, and McCain could not come closer than 8 points in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain adviser called that a ``devastating'' showing, and
another aide said the senator would meet with friends and advisers
at his Arizona ranch to ``take stock of our losses.''
</P>
<P>
   His withdrawal appeared likely ahead of primaries Tuesday in the
South, where Bush is heavily favored.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reached out to McCain on Wednesday in an effort to heal the
breach opened by an often-bitter contest. ``He waged a good
campaign,'' Bush said from his home in Austin. ``He's a tough
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The third Republican candidate, Alan Keyes, failed to score in
double digits anywhere but Minnesota, often a maverick-minded
state. There, he won 20 percent of the vote, beating McCain for
second place.
</P>
<P>
   The compressed primary season thus effectively ended with the
expected candidates on top, but Bush suffered damage after a
surprisingly tough fight.
</P>
<P>
   The rough-edged Republican campaign looked likely to spill over
into the battle ahead, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a spirited contest,'' Bush said. ``I'm
looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor mocked Gore for saying Tuesday that he was
ready to attack the problem of unregulated ``soft money'' political
contributions. ``The first thing he needs to do is debate Bill
Clinton on soft money,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   While calling for a loftier, issue-centered, campaign, each
candidate took hard swipes at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Gore challenged Bush ``to hold joint open meetings with me to
make this a contest of ideas, not insults,'' implicitly criticizing
the way the Republican contest had played out.
</P>
<P>
   He called for ``a campaign conducted in full daylight, and not
through secretly funded, special-interest attack ads, or smear
telephone calls from the extremist right wing.'' His references
were to Bush backers from the religious right whose support was
bitterly assailed by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of his vulnerability for the aggressive fund-raising
tactics employed in 1996, when Gore took part _ unwittingly, he has
said _ in an illegal fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in Los
Angeles, the vice president sought to defuse the issue by saying
that he had ``learned from his mistakes'' and would fix ``a broken
system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush kept his fire turned on Gore. ``I will remind Al Gore
that Americans do not want a White House where there is no
``controlling legal authority,''' he said, mocking the legalistic
phrase Gore used to defend his fund-raising role in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In ``eight years of partisanship, gridlock and division,'' Bush
contended, the Democratic administration had done little to improve
schools, had weakened the nation's military capabilities and had
dallied as the Social Security retirement program faced a threat of
insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a very tough, no-holds-barred campaign,''
predicted Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American
University in Washington, ``because both Bush and Gore have shown
they'll do whatever it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lichtman predicted that with both sides seeking to lure McCain
supporters, each candidate would try to claim the mantle of the
reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would position himself as a conservative reformer, ``the
guy who can fix Social Security, boost education, give some tax
relief,'' while Gore would present himself as a liberal reformer,
who would ``embrace campaign-finance reform, extend health-care
coverage and improve education,'' Lichtman said.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate again touched on those themes Wednesday. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 750, OR CONTINUE TO 975) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Opinion polls indicate that Bush and Gore will begin their push
to the election in November at rough parity. Lichtman said that at
the moment Gore, as the head of ``a united party at a time of peace
and prosperity,'' had a slight lead.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some reversal of expected roles after the often
harsh Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began a year ago with Bush the presumptive nominee of a
united party, with a great advantage in resources and a perception
of someone who was a very strong candidate able to make centrist
appeals'' while retaining the support of core Republicans, said
Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was seen as an uncomfortable candidate, being forced
leftward by a strong challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mann said, ``Bush has been driven to the right, the
aura of invincibility has dissipated, there are questions about
just how ready he is for national prime time, he's got divisions in
his party and he's taken positions that limit his appeal among
independents and weak Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary season is far from over, but the Bush and Gore
victories place the two candidates in virtually unstoppable
positions. Colorado, Utah and Wyoming hold primaries Friday, and
Florida, Texas and four other Southern states vote Tuesday. Bush is
strong in both regions. &QL;

 &HT;    Smoltz to undergo ligament-repair surgery; out for season
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ After five years of fighting his right elbow,
John Smoltz finally lost.
</P>
<P>
   Two arthroscopic surgeries, four stints on the disabled list, a
new arm angle and the addition of a knuckleball _ none of it could
prevent a tired ligament from tearing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Cy Young award winner is headed for
ligament-repair surgery, announced Wednesday. The Braves were left
wondering what it will be like to go through an entire season
without a member of the pitching triumvirate that has made them a
perennial World Series contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a chance I won't pitch again, but there's also
a great chance I'll pitch again and pitch well and have fun,''
Smoltz said. ``I haven't had a whole lot of fun lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz will be paid $7.75 million this year, with insurance
covering almost all of it for the Braves, and the club has an
option for next season at $8 million. Smoltz's past elbow problems
forced him to consider retirement before the season, but his
decision for surgery apparently signals that he's not ready to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz pitched two innings Sunday in his first outing of the
spring. Almost half of his pitches were knuckleballs. It was
evidence that his elbow was about to betray him, but not nearly as
telling as the pain he endured for five hours afterward. Smoltz
said he never felt a specific pop, but by that night he had a
pretty good idea what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Another trip through an MRI
</P>
<P>
   tube on Wednesday confirmed his fears. Dr. James Andrews will
rebuild his medial collateral ligament on March 23 in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Smoltz was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look at it now like I've got three or four more good
years, rather than dealing with not knowing,'' Smoltz said. ``It's
definitely not the news a pitcher wants to hear, but at the same
time I am positive for the future, more so now than I was. I've
dealt with a lot, so I feel I can deal with this. I've seen already
guys from our team pitch after it. I'm just being as positive as I
can. And I'm getting a straightjacket fitted for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz won 145 games for the Braves in the 1990s, plus 12 more
in the playoffs and World Series. Together with Greg Maddux and Tom
Glavine, he gave the team the most reliable starting staff in
baseball for much of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't replace somebody of his caliber,'' general manager
John Schuerholz said. ``What we're going to have to do, I told
Tommy (Glavine) and Mad Dog (Maddux) this morning, we'll have to
circle the wagons real tight.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate plans for filling his spot in the rotation involve
moving Kevin Millwood there. Terry Mulholland and Bruce Chen,
expected to battle for the fifth starting spot, may both make the
rotation. Steve Avery will be considered, although he is not fully
recovered from shoulder surgery in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll evaluate who we have here, how comfortable we feel with
how we make things work in John's absence and decide whether we
need to look outside the organization,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz has pitched 2,414 1/3 innings in his 12-year career,
third among Braves pitchers since the franchise moved to Atlanta,
behind Phil Niekro (4,533) and Glavine (2,660 2/3). He has pitched
another 181 2/3 innings in the posteason, and his 12 postseason
wins are the most by any pitcher in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   The last Braves fans saw of him was in October, airing it out in
Game 4 of the World Series in Yankee Stadium. After three months of
throwing side-armed to thwart the pain, Smoltz had returned to his
over-the-top motion. ``John's one of the great pitchers who's ever
pitched in this game, one of the biggest big-game pitchers to ever
play,'' Chipper Jones said. ``It's a tremendous loss for us, but we
dealt with it before. We're going to have to deal with it again.
Somebody's going to have to step up. Somebody's going to have to
pitch well. We're going to have to score more runs, whatever it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz will join Kerry Ligtenberg and Odalis Perez as Braves
pitchers who have had the surgery in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   By this time last year, Andres Galarraga was already lost for
the season becausae of lymphoma in his back, and Ligtenberg was a
day away from blowing out his elbow in a spring-training game.
</P>
<P>
   The bright spot for Smoltz is that Ligtenberg pitched well
Tuesday in his first game back. He already has sought Ligtenberg's
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him if he wanted to be ready for next year he needs to
do it as quick as he can,'' said Ligtenberg, who regrets waiting a
month to have his surgery April 6 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The team takes another big blow inside the clubhouse where
Smoltz, a devout Christian and a fun-loving competitor in anything
from Ping-Pong to bowling, is one of the most thoughtful and
well-liked players on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll miss him, but he's promised me he'll be around the
ballpark a lot, because he is a huge influence on our team,'' Bobby
Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to describe his reaction to the news, Maddux said:
``Mourning for the Atlanta Braves.'' He paused and then said, ``And
the road golf schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to his scratch golfing partner with the best
connections at courses around the country. ``When you pitch in
pain, the game's not fun,'' Maddux said. ``I'm actually glad he's
getting it done. He's going to get a year off, a mulligan, and come
back stronger than he was before. I'm happy for him. I don't think
he's enjoyed the last couple years like the rest of us have,
because of his elbow.''

 &HT;    SEC title door wide openBy Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officially, it is the Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the 41st edition should sound like a stop on the PGA
Tour. Say, the Roy Kramer SEC Quad-Champs Open. With the emphasis
on ``Open,'' Kentucky tradition and recent tourney history
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day affair that returns today to the Georgia Dome could
be the most competitive in SEC tournament history. And maybe the
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best league in the country this year,'' Florida's
Billy Donovan said. ``Maybe the best ever in SEC history. If you
can (advance) in this tournament, it speaks volumes about your
program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's anybody's tournament,'' Kentucky's Tubby Smith said.
Smith's 'Cats have won seven of the last eight SEC tourneys, the
last two commandingly under Smith in the Dome, in the city
Kentucky's come to call ``Catlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was good,'' Georgia's Jim Harrick said about to his
SEC baptism, ``but I don't think there's anything like what's going
on in this league. I legitimately think we have a chance to have
three teams go to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the senior coach, 11 years in this league, and it's the
best I've ever seen,'' South Carolina's Eddie Fogler said. ``I'm
not going to say who's the best team. We've got four teams that can
say that _ quad-champs. No one else in the country can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not now, not ever. When Kentucky thoroughly beat Florida 85-70
Saturday, it not only gave UK a share of its 40th SEC
regular-season title. It also left Kentucky, Florida, Tennessee and
LSU each 12-4 in the SEC, the first four-way tie for a major
conference title. In 1995 in the Atlantic Coast Conference, Wake
Forest, North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia all finished 12-4,
but the ACC crowns its tournament winner as its conference champion
and does not recognize a regular-season title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got four teams up there at 12-4,'' Tennessee coach
Jerry Green said, ``and everybody that's been at the top has been
thumped at some time.''

 &HT;    Defending champions have problems
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody takes shots at the king, probing for cracks in the
armor, perceiving weakness even when none exists.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs, the defending NBA champions appear to
have a number of weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were the story of the year when they won the NBA title
last June. They captured the attention of the nation after starting
forward Sean Elliott had successful kidney transplant surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But problems have tarnished the Spurs' image, and, although they
appear ready to challenge for another title, they are a longshot to
repeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers, Portland and Utah are ahead of the Spurs
in the Western Conference, with the Lakers and Blazers the class of
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Most of San Antonio's problems appear to be internal _ lack of
perimeter offense, the distraction of Tim Duncan's impending
free-agency and lack of domination by David Robinson. Now,
dissension surrounds point guard Avery Johnson. Once known as an
effervescent, over-achiever who fooled everyone by pushing himself
out of the minor leagues, Johnson came back to the Spurs twice
after they waived him and evolved into a key player on a title
team.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, ex-teammate Chucky Brown called him a ``snake in the
grass.'' Brown, now with Charlotte, who got his release from the
Spurs on Feb. 4, said Johnson who ruined his stay in San Antonio.
He suggested that Johnson was instrumental in the team's decision
to limit Brown's role and ultimately send him, uninjured, to the
injured list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to always make suggestions to (coach and general
manager Greg Popovich), so it's possible,'' Brown said after asking
for his release. ``I don't see him on any All-Star teams. ... But
you know, he's a man of God. God will deal with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last summer, owner Peter Holt told Johnson he was such a
long-serving and vital member of the organization that it was time
for him to move his entire family to San Antonio and make it his
permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   But near the trading deadline, Popovich tried to trade Johnson
to Charlotte for David Wesley or to the Clippers for Derek
Anderson. Johnson said he felt betrayed because he had always
supported Popovich. Johnson had complained about being benched in
crunch time in favor of Terry Porter, now injured. Then several
Spurs leaked the news that post-game grousing resulted in a brawl
after a game in Cleveland, with Johnson fighting backup forward
Malik Rose on the locker-room floor.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Johnson must defend his honor as well as his game.
``When I was a below-average NBA player, nobody talked much about
me,'' Johnson says. ``But now, as you move up the ladder a little
bit, when you hit the game-winning shot (in the Finals), it's all
right to celebrate. But what about when people start putting you
under the microscope? And when one thing goes wrong, it's all blown
out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Duncan, Johnson will be a free agent. He is seeking a
three-year contract for $24 million. The Spurs are believed to be
offering one year at $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's one more problem than a defending champion needs.

 &HT;    Trio unlikely NASCAR owners
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Three Georgia businessmen are the most unlikely car
owners in NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   MB2 Motorsports, which owns the No. 36 Pontiac driven by Kenny
Schrader, is owned by people whose resumes give little indication
of an inclination toward stock-car racing.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Beard is an investment banker who used to work in the White
House. Read Morton is a lawyer who spent 16 years practicing law
with Billy Payne, and Nelson Bowers is a former football star
turned car dealer who says he knows nothing about the internal
workings of an automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Many Winston Cup car owners formed their teams after either
driving race cars or working on them. The road that the MB2 owners
took to Winston Cup ownership was paved with contacts made through
the National Symphony Orchestra, the 1996 Olympics and the Georgia
Bulldogs, among others.
</P>
<P>
   None had more than a passing interest in stock-car racing before
starting the No. 36 team four years ago. Their main sporting
passion was watching football games at their alma mater, the
University of Georgia. All three attended UGA during the mid-1960s,
but they didn't know each other until after they graduated. ``I was
on the board of trustees of the National Symphony Orchestra (in New
York), which is a pretty strange way to get into NASCAR racing,''
Beard said. He is an investment banker who grew up in Moultrie and
once worked as a deputy assistant to then-President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   While on the Orchestra board, Beard met a member of the Mars
family, which owns the Mars Candy Co. Mars has been involved in
NASCAR racing on and off for years.
</P>
<P>
   Through his investment banking, Beard knew Nelson Bowers, a high
school football star from Rossville who played linebacker for
Georgia until a fractured vertebra ended his football career.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers knew Rick Hendrick, a fellow car dealer who also owns
three Winston Cup teams.
</P>
<P>
   Morton, Payne's former law partner, had done legal work for
Bowers and also knew Beard. Mars, which once had its Snickers brand
advertised on the No. 8 car in Winston Cup, was interested in
getting back into racing.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the three Georgians, Mars worked out a deal for
partial sponsorship of two of Hendricks' cars, but the candy
company also wanted a car of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks suggested that Morton, Beard and Bowers start their
own team for the 1997 NASCAR season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'If you guys are interested, I'll help you all I
can,' `` Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say we're like a fourth Hendrick team, but
that's just not true,'' Beard said. ``Rick's a great guy, but we're
our own team.''
</P>
<P>
   MB2 Motorsports' first move was to hire a general manager, Jay
Frye, and leave the racing to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're adjusting the spoiler, we don't tell them what to
do, and none of them ask our opinion,'' Beard said. Derrike Cope
was hired to drive the car for 1997, and Ryan Pemberton came on as
crew chief. ``Derrike was exactly what we needed _ somebody to put
us on the map,'' Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   After Cope recorded two top-10 finishes _ one in the top five _
and finished 27th in points, the owners decided to take a bold step
for the 1998 season. They hired Ernie Irvan, who had 15 career
victories, to drive their car. But racing injuries, one of which
almost cost Irvan his life in 1994, came back to haunt Irvan and
MB2.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ernie got hurt the first time, we were on the verge of
doing something extremely, extremely good,'' Bowers said. ``We felt
like we were definitely players.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan missed the final three races of 1998 after a crash at
Talladega. He returned in 1999 but suffered a career-ending head
injury in a crash at Michigan. The team finshed the season with
Dick Trickle or Jerry Nadeau at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader has brought renewed optimism to the team, the owners
say. ``He provides stability, and that's what we need,'' Beard
said.
</P>
<P>
   A casual conversation with Frye led Schrader to leave Andy
Petree's team and drive the No. 36. ``I thought about it a little
bit and said, 'Hey, were you serious?' It all happened really
quick,'' Schrader said. ``They've never won, and I haven't won
since '91, but we feel like we've got everything it takes to win,
and we're going to set a goal of winning every time we go out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   All three owners say they expect to win soon, but they also
realize that racing is a tough business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not win the Winston Cup this year, but we want to do
well,'' Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   The business-like approach to their race team, which has an
annual budget of just under $ 8 millon, has earned the three owners
the respect of NASCAR's insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, the sanctioning body's chief operating officer,
said Morton, Beard and Bowers are, ``a good addition to the NASCAR
family.'' Helson said. ``They want to be competitive, but they are
patient and are going about it in a methodical way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Clark, president of Atlanta Motor Speedway, said he is
particularly pleased to have a second team of Georgians _ along
with Dawsonville's Bill Elliott _ in Winston Cup in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta used to be the hub of racing, but now we're just
hanging on,'' Clark said. ``Winston Cup racing is a lot more
complicated than I ever dreamed it was,'' Morton said. ``And people
don't realize how much of a team sport it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It also can be exciting, Beard said. ``I sometimes find my hands
clenched during the races,'' he said. ``I have to get the fingers
on one hand to straighten the fingers on the other.''

<P>
   He is not retiring, nor is he merely fading away. Lothar
Matthaus played his last game for Bayern Munich on Wednesday in a
4-1 win over Real Madrid to advance to the quarterfinals of the
European Champions League. But the score was hardly the story.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaus, 39, the most capped international male player ever,
will report to Major League Soccer's MetroStars later this week.
But the gritty left back bade an emotional farewell to club
football in his homeland and was the center of attention
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   After being named the German player of the year last year,
Matthaus said he wanted to close out his club career much like
another German legend and will follow Franz Beckenbauer to New
York. The MetroStars are hardly the Cosmos, the North American
Soccer League's lasting claim to fame. But for MLS, which begins
its fifth season later this month, an aging player apparently with
plenty of soccer left in him figures to be an asset.
</P>
<P>
   There were haggles between Bayern and MLS over his transfer, and
plenty of petulance from Matthaus, who has a reputation for being
difficult. But an Olympiastadion capacity crowd chanted and sang
his name all throughout the match, and Matthaus could barely fight
back tears when he was substituted in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Champions League: Barca, United advance
</P>
<P>
   Abelardo and Rivaldo scored as Barcelona qualified for the
quarterfinals in a 2-0 whitewash of Porto on Tuesday. The other
spot from Group A is up for grabs after Sparta Prague's 1-0 win
over Hertha Berlin, with Milan Fukal scoring in the 90th minute....
Manchester United moved into the lead in Group B and clinched a
quarterfinal spot with a 2-1 win over Bordeaux, coupled with
Valencia's 2-0 win over Fiorentina.
</P>
<P>
   England: Murdoch eyes Chelsea
</P>
<P>
   British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite company that holds live
Premier League television rights, has purchased a 9.9 percent stake
in Chelsea, making it the fifth English club to come into the
Rupert Murdoch empire. BSkyB, whose contract is up next year, also
owns a similar percentage of Manchester United, Manchester City,
Leeds United and Sunderland. Firms that want more than 10 percent
of a club have to go through British antitrust channels, a pitfall
that sank Murdoch's bid last year for a majority stake in
Manchester United. The moves are seen as a bid to capitalize on the
likelihood that teams soon will be able to sell their own TV
rights.... Manchester United on Wednesday became the first soccer
club in the world to be valued at more than one billion pounds
sterling ($1.6 billion U.S.) on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Inter tops Milan rival
</P>
<P>
   How many teams would love to have Ivan Zamorano, Chile's World
Cup striker, in reserve for a big derby match? Zamorano got things
rolling for Inter Milan with a 43rd-minute goal, and Luigi DiBiagio
struck in the second half in a 2-1 win over AC Milan. Inter, which
moves into third place in Serie A, is without the injured Christian
Vieri and Ronaldo. Also getting credit for Inter's strong run is
Uruguayan attacking midfielder Alvaro Recoba, who has scored 10
goals in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Keller out for a month
</P>
<P>
   Kasey Keller, Rayo Vallecano's American goalkeeper, will be out
close to a month after dislocating his collarbone Sunday in the
club's 1-0 loss to Alaves. The Basque club, promoted this season,
surprisingly is in second place in the Primera Division....
Barcelona striker Luis Enrique could be out for three months with a
knee injury, probably ruling him out for Spain in the European
championships this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico: Tigres face replays
</P>
<P>
   The hot start by UNL Tigres in the Torneo Verano has come with a
price. The club has been told it must replay three matches because
of improper actions regarding the transfer of Donizete, a striker
who came from Vasco da Gama of Brazil. Tigres defeated Atlante,
Toluca and Monterrey, but those matches must be contested again.

   WASHINGTON _ After a dramatic sweep of Democratic primaries by
Vice President Al Gore and a series of one-sided victories by
Governor George W. Bush in the biggest Republican primaries, the
two candidates lost no time Wednesday in turning their attention
toward the general election in November, laying out the outlines of
their electoral platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief rivals for the parties' presidential nominations,
meanwhile, were reported to be close to dropping out of the race.
Former Senator Bill Bradley lost to Gore in every Democratic
contest on Tuesday, even in his native Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona had more to show from the
coast-to-coast Republican contests.
</P>
<P>
   He defeated Bush in the New England states of Vermont,
Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. But his aides had
counted on victory in New York or Ohio, the biggest contests
Tuesday after California, to revive his flagging fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush won by close to 20 percentage points in California
and Ohio, and McCain could not come closer than 8 points in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain adviser called that a ``devastating'' showing, and
another aide said the senator would meet with friends and advisers
at his Arizona ranch to ``take stock of our losses.''
</P>
<P>
   His withdrawal appeared likely ahead of primaries Tuesday in the
South, where Bush is heavily favored.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reached out to McCain on Wednesday in an effort to heal the
breach opened by an often-bitter contest. ``He waged a good
campaign,'' Bush said from his home in Austin. ``He's a tough
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The third Republican candidate, Alan Keyes, failed to score in
double digits anywhere but Minnesota, often a maverick-minded
state. There, he won 20 percent of the vote, beating McCain for
second place.
</P>
<P>
   The compressed primary season thus effectively ended with the
expected candidates on top, but Bush suffered damage after a
surprisingly tough fight.
</P>
<P>
   The rough-edged Republican campaign looked likely to spill over
into the battle ahead, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a spirited contest,'' Bush said. ``I'm
looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor mocked Gore for saying Tuesday that he was
ready to attack the problem of unregulated ``soft money'' political
contributions. ``The first thing he needs to do is debate Bill
Clinton on soft money,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   While calling for a loftier, issue-centered, campaign, each
candidate took hard swipes at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Gore challenged Bush ``to hold joint open meetings with me to
make this a contest of ideas, not insults,'' implicitly criticizing
the way the Republican contest had played out.
</P>
<P>
   He called for ``a campaign conducted in full daylight, and not
through secretly funded, special-interest attack ads, or smear
telephone calls from the extremist right wing.'' His references
were to Bush backers from the religious right whose support was
bitterly assailed by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of his vulnerability for the aggressive fund-raising
tactics employed in 1996, when Gore took part _ unwittingly, he has
said _ in an illegal fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in Los
Angeles, the vice president sought to defuse the issue by saying
that he had ``learned from his mistakes'' and would fix ``a broken
system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush kept his fire turned on Gore. ``I will remind Al Gore
that Americans do not want a White House where there is no
``controlling legal authority,''' he said, mocking the legalistic
phrase Gore used to defend his fund-raising role in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In ``eight years of partisanship, gridlock and division,'' Bush
contended, the Democratic administration had done little to improve
schools, had weakened the nation's military capabilities and had
dallied as the Social Security retirement program faced a threat of
insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a very tough, no-holds-barred campaign,''
predicted Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American
University in Washington, ``because both Bush and Gore have shown
they'll do whatever it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lichtman predicted that with both sides seeking to lure McCain
supporters, each candidate would try to claim the mantle of the
reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would position himself as a conservative reformer, ``the
guy who can fix Social Security, boost education, give some tax
relief,'' while Gore would present himself as a liberal reformer,
who would ``embrace campaign-finance reform, extend health-care
coverage and improve education,'' Lichtman said.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate again touched on those themes Wednesday. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 750, OR CONTINUE TO 975) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Opinion polls indicate that Bush and Gore will begin their push
to the election in November at rough parity. Lichtman said that at
the moment Gore, as the head of ``a united party at a time of peace
and prosperity,'' had a slight lead.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some reversal of expected roles after the often
harsh Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began a year ago with Bush the presumptive nominee of a
united party, with a great advantage in resources and a perception
of someone who was a very strong candidate able to make centrist
appeals'' while retaining the support of core Republicans, said
Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was seen as an uncomfortable candidate, being forced
leftward by a strong challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mann said, ``Bush has been driven to the right, the
aura of invincibility has dissipated, there are questions about
just how ready he is for national prime time, he's got divisions in
his party and he's taken positions that limit his appeal among
independents and weak Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary season is far from over, but the Bush and Gore
victories place the two candidates in virtually unstoppable
positions. Colorado, Utah and Wyoming hold primaries Friday, and
Florida, Texas and four other Southern states vote Tuesday. Bush is
strong in both regions. &QL;

BUSH, GORE SHIFT FOCUS TO THE POLITICAL MIDDLE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The instant analysis of the looming fall matchup
between Al Gore and George W. Bush is it sounds so familiar. The
son of the former president takes on the vice president who helped
retire his father. Call it 1992 redux: the grudge match.
</P>
<P>
   But this is far from a replay of President Bush vs. Bill
Clinton. Indeed, as the candidates Wednesday began formulating
their general election strategies, with both racing to the fertile
middle ground of American politics, some of the roles from eight
years ago have been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, it was President Bush, the establishment candidate with
vast foreign policy experience, taking on not just Clinton, but
also his home state of Arkansas. Today, it is Gore, the Washington
establishment politician, who is taking on not just the Texas
governor, but also his home state, lambasting its environmental and
health-care record.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, is continuing his father's failed campaign
against ``Clintonism'' even as a he borrows a page from the Clinton
playbook to cast himself the centrist-seeking reformer who will
shake up Washington. Bush replaces Clinton's ``New Democrat'' tag
with ``compassionate conservatism,'' but the idea is the same:
capture the middle in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough campaign, but ultimately what's going
to decide the campaign is the message of reform and message of
renewal,'' Bush said. Foreshadowing major themes of the fall
campaign, Bush called Gore an ``agent of Washington,'' while Gore
blasted Bush's ``risky tax scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely catching a breath after all but wrapping up their party's
nominations, both candidates aimed their sights on disaffected
voters who supported Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican,
and, to a lesser degree, former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley,
the Democrat. But they plan to court those voters in very different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign believes the Texas governor can't win
moderates unless he gains strong support from women. Bush did very
well with this group in some Super Tuesday states, winning among
Republican women in California by a two-to-one margin. But the
majority of women who vote in the general election are Democrats
and independents, and Bush is vulnerable on some issues important
to women. For example, Bush, unlike Gore, has gone through the the
bulk of the primaries without unveiling any major plans for health
care or environmental protection. Also, Bush's position against
abortion rights might hurt him with some women in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush is appealing to the McCain supporters and moderates by
highlighting his plans for education and attacking Gore on McCain's
central issue, campaign finance. Bush once again mocked Gore for
going to a Buddhist temple during the 1996 campaign to collect
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, is also going after McCain voters by asserting
that he is the candidate interested in overhauling campaign
finance. Gore said he would be willing to ban unlimited ``soft
money'' donations to the political parties. But, as Bush noted,
Gore is making this proposal even as Clinton is raising millions of
dollars for the Democratic Party, which plans to use the
unregulated cash to help elect Gore as president.
</P>
<P>
   For those voters who recently tuned in to the primary campaign,
it may have seemed like the biggest voter concerns were Bob Jones
University, anti-Catholic bias and fund-raising at a Buddhist
temple. But what plays during the primaries as ``wedge'' issues
often has no relevance for the fall campaign. Barring a war or a
rapid decline in the economy, the general election is likely to
focus on education, health care and maintaining prosperity,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as the public may want the candidates to talk about
the future, they are also likely to focus on the past. Bush would
like to make the general election about morality, highlighting the
Clinton-Gore administration's ethical lapses, which included the
impeachment trial of the president. For Bush, this is the ``I told
you so'' issue, a reminder that his father warned voters that
Clinton couldn't be trusted in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, wants voters to look farther back, linking the
Texas governor with his father's administration, a period when the
economy was much less robust than today.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kaufman, the former political director of President Bush's
White House, said the governor could win the presidency with a
message that sounds largely moderate. ``It is going to be getting
back to the basic core message that governors make a difference,
that he is a uniter, not a divider, that he can talk to Hispanics,
blacks and women, who aren't traditional groups in the Republican
Party,'' Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   As for winning over the McCain voters, Kaufman, a GOP national
committeeman from Massachusetts, said Bush must push his message
that he is an outsider, while Gore is the Washington insider.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stu Rothenberg summed up the coming race this
way: ``You will see Bush moving back to the center, stressing his
success with Hispanics and African Americans, education, and the
issues he talked about earlier ... You will see more talk about
character and ethics and the president as moral leader. And you
will see Gore talking much more about `risky Republican tax cuts,'
health care, minimum wage and a Republican Congress. Those will be
the fault lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of winning the middle was underscored in the
popular vote in California. While Bush easily beat McCain among
California Republicans, the all-voter nature of the ``beauty
contest'' in that state provides an insight into what may happen in
the fall campaign. Gore won the California popular vote mainly with
support from moderates. The popular vote broke down this way: 27
percent said they were liberal, 40 percent moderate and 33 percent
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush easily beat Gore won among conservatives by a
six-to-one margin, and Gore easily won liberals by a similar
amount, the race was decided by moderates, who went for Gore by
two-to-one. Gore's goal is to build on that moderate strength in
the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In another bright spot for Gore, he easily beat Bush among
California Hispanics, 56 percent to 18 percent, and among blacks,
73 percent to 9 percent. Bush for months has said he can appeal to
both of these groups that could be decisive voting blocs in several
key states.
</P>
<P>
   In the primaries, McCain was unable to win sizable support among
Republicans. Now the question is whether Bush can win large support
outside the Republican Party. The answer to that question is likely
to determine the outcome in November.

COMMENTARY: GETTING OVER IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the jailed D.C. Mayor Marion Barry came
roaring back to win re-election a few years ago, he delivered a
classic message to those he trounced: ``Get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how moderate Republicans, independents and dissident
Democrats can get over this week's decisive defeat of John McCain
by George W. Bush. Resist the temptation to blame McCain as
messenger for the GOP rank-and-file's rejection of his campaign
reform message. Tactical errors under stress had little to do with
McCain's defeat in New York, Ohio and California. Instead, face the
half-dozen lessons of politics 2000:
</P>
<P>
   1.  &UR; Pat Robertson rules. &LR;  The religious right, combined with GOP
organization leaders, determines the selection of Republican
candidates in most non-Eastern states. Barring a disastrous loss
this November, no insurgent is likely to win nomination without
that combination.
</P>
<P>
   2.  &UR; The supposedly outmoded strategy of swinging rightward for
the nomination and then to the center for the election is still
in-moded. &LR;  No Republican is likely to carry New York state without
doing well in Manhattan's moderate ``Silk Stocking'' district,
which McCain carried easily and which Bush needs.
</P>
<P>
   3. News for nattering nabobs:  &UR; Never knock negativism. &LR;  It still
works; attack ads accusing McCain of hypocrisy took their toll. But
not always: the New York Bush campaign's ``daisy spot'' _ charging
McCain with being insufficiently opposed to breast cancer _ hurt
Bush on Long Island, where Republican women did not take kindly to
the politicization of disease.
</P>
<P>
   4.  &UR; Jack Dempsey lives: The best defense is still a good
offense. &LR;  Savants despise complaining as ``off message'' or
whining. However, to escalate the complainant's counterattack and
then to attack that exaggeration (``He called me a bigot!'') works
as offensive defense.
</P>
<P>
   5.  &UR; Soft money talks. &LR;  Although the billionaire Wyly brothers
never slept in the Texas governor's mansion, their $2.3 million in
``independent'' final-weekend spots slamming McCain reached target
voters. Publicity about the secret source of soft money generated
no countervailing voter reaction, proving that _
</P>
<P>
   6.  &UR; Outrage is out. &LR;  Conventional wisdom about a majority's
unconcern about campaign finance reform was right. (Lobbyists may
take to wearing gold-plated iron triangles in their lapels.)
Democrats profess support for a soft-money ban as expiation for
unpunished Clinton-Gore sins of 1996, but would abandon it if they
took control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Do these six lessons of hardball mean that all those opposed to
forking over for favors _ the well-whipped, starry-eyed goo-goos of
the McCain Minority _ should fold their tents and silently steal
away?
</P>
<P>
   No. These centrist losers have become kingmakers. Practical pols
know that as the Mc.M. goes, so goes the presidential election.
Therefore, after one day of pouting and sulking and what-iffing,
McCain's crusaders should be looking to the movement's leader to be
power broker for a good chunk of campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, guilt-ridden about '96 fund-raising, promises everything
McCain wants. Bush, to augment his depleted war chest, promises
nothing, but invites McCain to ``team up.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes two to team up. One of McCain's fuzzier desires is a
pledge from Bush to run a clean campaign. I'd forget that; when
Bush gets the expected knee to the groin, he will respond with a
gouge to the eye. The most Bush can promise is to promptly
repudiate sleazy tactics by mud-slinging supporters.
</P>
<P>
   However, the senator _ with his loose network of followers, his
sizable bloc of delegates and with Gore's offer in his pocket _
should have more than a little leverage at this summer's GOP
convention. He should use it to extract specific compromises from
Bush on finance reform in the party platform _ some parts before
the election, more afterward if victorious.
</P>
<P>
   In the speeches nominating McCain in Philadelphia, and in his
own prime-time address to the delegates and the nation, a clear
message about breaking the iron triangle should be driven home.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is prepared to alienate his religious right by making a
substantive move to the reformist center, McCain should ``team up''
with enthusiasm. If Bush demands blind loyalty, McCain should pat
him on the back, loyally wish him well, and say, with Milton,
``They also serve who only stand and wait.''

 &HT;    Dear Diary: The roof fell in and I'm in Atlanta. Does Bridget
Jones have days like this?
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She may be one of the few women in the world to dash
expectations by not turning out to be utterly helpless, chronically
inebriated and a bit daft.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, when British author Helen Fielding arrives nearly 10
minutes late for an interview, the explanation is rather mundane _
a phone call to deal with roof problems at her recently purchased
Los Angeles house _ but the delivery definitely is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit that when I walked in and saw it collapsed, my
instant reaction was to realize it was quite funny,'' Fielding said
Wednesday with a grin in the staid dining room of Midtown Atlanta's
Four Seasons Hotel, almost as if she were confessing to having a
dirty thought. ``I mean, here I thought I was very glamorous moving
to L.A., and I'm spending all my time with the roofing contractors
and wearing mackintoshes and mopping, mopping!''
</P>
<P>
   That is, in between counting her millions, turning her book into
a movie, and almost single-handedly empowering an entire generation
of young (and not-so-young) single women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridget Jones's Diary,'' which first hit U.S. stores in 1998,
has sold 4 million copies, the bulk of them to young women who
delighted in Fielding's comic take on her 30-something heroine's
mundane concerns, from doing as little as possible at work or with
her parents, to finding men and pantyhose that wouldn't run at the
first snag.
</P>
<P>
   For many women, it seems, ``Bridget's'' printed pages were more
akin to a looking glass or a precise readout of their private
thought patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because there's too much shoved at us, too many
images of perfection,'' said Fielding, who was in town to sign
copies of her just-released sequel, ``Bridget Jones: The Edge of
Reason,'' at the Chapter 11 bookstore at Peachtree Battle. ``You
don't read much in magazines about real human beings, about
kindness or wittiness or optimism, especially as it occurs in young
women. And so it comes to seem as if all you should be is
successful and beautiful and thin.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news _ or bad, depending on one's opinion of the first
book _ is that the sequel picks up a mere six weeks later. That
means Bridget is basically unchanged from the ``Rain Man''-esque
recorder of calories consumed, cigarettes smoked and anonymous
hang-up calls to ex-boyfriends who muddled her way through
``Diary'' _ although now, along with the omnipresent bottle of
Chardonnay, she also has such an addiction to relationship
self-help books she worries they may be sabotaging her chances of
having a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, it also means more of the same hostile reaction from
a significant faction who disliked ``Diary,'' particularly in the
United States. At its most benign, the criticism leveled by some
readers, journalists and social observers was that the Jones girl
was wearingly whiny and unwilling to change _ the sort of
all-too-familiar character many real-life women ditch as soon as
their parents _ or their college _ stop making them share a room.
Too much of the same old Bridget is the common theme of many of the
less glowing reviews to greet the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who like her, it's because she's like your
friend,'' said Fielding, adding that it would have been
intellectually dishonest to significantly alter Bridget's basic
character in the second book. ``People who don't like her,
honestly, it's a sort of almost political position they have on
her. If we can't laugh at ourselves, we haven't gotten very far,
have we?''
</P>
<P>
   At its most extreme, the criticism linked Bridget with TV's Ally
McBeal in a sort of ``you can never be too thin or too romance
crazy'' mode that was supposedly more of a threat to the women's
movement than Phyllis Schlafly. Fielding seems somewhat bemused by
the oversize, overheated reaction to what are, essentially, books
about small incidents, often dashed off in diarylike sentence
fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Head goes here
</P>
<P>
   But there's also a bigger issue at stake, according to Fielding,
who began writing ``Diary'' under a pseudonym for a London
newspaper. She defends her creation as a slightly exaggerated and
always empathetic encapsulation of the serious predicaments many
modern women face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did seem that there was this whole group of women that was
saddled with this image that was horribly out of date and really
unfair,'' said Fielding, a never-married, former BBC journalist who
admits only to being in her early 40s. ``It's ridiculous that women
in their 30s who are very good professionally, have made their own
lives, have got good lives, and have clearly had to make hard
decisions not to be married, felt like rejects. When it's a
question of being brave and not compromising.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Fielding lingua franca, these women became known as
``singletons,'' while friends who couldn't relate to them without
spouses and who constantly poked into their personal lives were
dismissed as ``smug marrieds.'' And now, as if poor old Bridget
didn't have enough people meddling in her life, two continents of
singleton sympathizers are in an uproar over the choice of blond
Texan Renee Zellweger to play the title role in the upcoming film
version of ``Diary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the clunking, Hollywood idiocy,'' wrote a columnist in
London's Independent newspaper. ``Casting her as a young and
perfect thing is like remaking `The Elephant Man' with Jude Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the casting controversy, Fielding is unflustered
and, well, un-Bridget-like.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very good in `Jerry Maguire.' She had that thing of
being able to look both beautiful and ordinary,'' said Fielding,
who wrote two early versions of the script for the movie, then
lessened her involvement this year because of the demands of
promoting the sequel. ``Besides, I can't be involved with things
like casting. It hits too close to home. I've got my own picture of
how everybody looks, and they don't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether she herself resembles Bridget Jones, the answer
appears to be a definite ... maybe. On one hand, Fielding says that
when she was a young student at Oxford, she recorded her daily
caloric intake on a calendar. On the other hand, she declined a
Swedish journalist's implied challenge to drink to excess in a
recent interview. ``I felt really mean, but I couldn't do that. I
had to get up early the next morning,'' Fielding recalled with a
laugh. ``I'm not sure how Bridget would manage on a book tour!''

 &HT;    NBC series sinks in spiritual lampooning
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   God looks like Jerry Garcia and talks like James Garner (who
supplies his voice). The Devil (Tony winner Alan Cumming) sits at
home in hell and shouts requests to Guy Lombardo, who performs
there with his orchestra nightly. And Bob (French Stewart, the
squinty one in ``3rd Rock From the Sun''), is a beer-drinking,
porn-downloading auto worker with a wife and two kids, all of whom
he loves, none of whom he understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, the Devil and Bob,'' NBC's animated series premiering at
8:30 tonight (it moves to 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays next week), sets those
title characters in motion in hopes that some sulfuric,
faith-provoking high jinks will ensue. This is satire as parable,
``King of the Hill'' meets ``Oh, God!,'' a comedy that means to
walk some high ground while it takes some low roads.
</P>
<P>
   It already has ruffled feathers: Two NBC affiliates won't air
it, one in Idaho and another in Salt Lake City (which also has
never aired ``Saturday Night Live'' or the daytime soap ``Sunset
Beach''). But as created by former seminarian Matthew Carlson, who
used theologians as consultants, ``God, the Devil and Bob'' is
rarely engaging enough to enrage us, or enraging enough to engage
us. It works too hard at being casually mischievous; you can see
the seams that stitched together these jokes from a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's pilot, the weakest of the three episodes previewed,
opens with this premise: God is ready to destroy the world but
decides he won't if just one soul can show him it's worth saving.
He lets his devilish pal the Devil pick that soul _ Bob.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show me the world's worth saving and I'll save it,'' God
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like a lot of work,'' says Bob. ``What's in it for
me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I made the right choice!'' exclaims the Devil.
</P>
<P>
   And like that. There are moments when the spiritual lampooning
moves beyond mere church-vestibule cutups. ``You're supposed to be
a benevolent God?'' a put-out Bob rants. ``Let's look at the
record: You're vague, you're unknowable, you let good people suffer
and lousy people prosper. ... You call yourself a father _ you're
more like a deadbeat dad.'' Pause. ``I'm just blowing off steam.''
</P>
<P>
   But those moments are more likely to prompt I-get-it nods rather
than real laughs, unlike ``The Simpsons,'' say, where a joke's
hidden layers hit you long after you've already been floored.
</P>
<P>
   By the second and third episodes, the focus turns more to Bob's
family, which includes wife Donna (Laurie Metcalf), 13-year-old
Megan and 6-year-old Andy.
</P>
<P>
   Megan (Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson) emerges as
the character with the most delectable world view (``It's like
ears. If you look at an ear, just look at it for like five minutes;
it'll literally make you sick'), and one wonders if the creators
wouldn't do better by ditching God, the Devil and Bob, and just
giving us a show called ``Megan.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, the Devil and Bob''
</P>
<P>
   8:30 tonight on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+

WITH BUSH HINTING UNITY, MCCAIN WEIGHS OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ They have both said and done some awful things.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few weeks of the campaign for the Republican
nomination, Arizona Senator John McCain and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, two men who began the contest calling each other ``friend,''
have seemed more like bitter enemies. The candidates and their
surrogates have sniped at, undermined, complained about, and
wounded each other, the acrimony drowning out issues and policy.
</P>
<P>
   So now that Bush's nomination, and McCain's withdrawal, seem
probable, will the erstwhile buddies make up?
</P>
<P>
   Probably, says Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon, our party will unite and turn to the main task at hand:
ending the era of Clinton,'' the governor told supporters Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, say aides to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw two reformers on the early morning news shows this
morning, both of them brand new to the reform movement, in Al Gore
and George Bush,'' said McCain's political director, John Weaver.
``They are not very credible message carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of a possible reconciliation between the two men
concerns more than their personal relationship: it is also about
their political fortunes. Each candidate has appealed to very
different sectors of the electorate in this campaign. Bush, usually
considered a moderate Republican, courted and won conservative
voters. McCain cornered the market on more moderate voters,
throwing around some strong criticisms of the party establishment
in the process. Without both groups of voters, Bush will have a
difficult time in the general election. And for McCain,
reconciliation with Bush might provide him with a more prominent
place in the GOP than he has held in the past.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, when McCain was asked whether he still considered
Bush a friend, he waited eleven long seconds, his jaw grinding
away, before he answered with an unconvincing yes. McCain was
incensed at $2.5 million worth of advertising, placed by Texas
business associates of Bush, criticizing McCain's record on the
environment. Later that day, he went a little further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say I'd talk to him. There's all kinds of friends,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, his chances of clinching the nomination growing
distant, McCain, who does not speak off the record, called Bush ``a
combination of the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow,''
and threw in a swipe at Bush's communications director for good
measure. ``And Karen Hughes is behind the curtain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain began running television ads during the South
Carolina contest comparing Bush to President Clinton, Bush
complained, jaw clenched, about his opponent taking the ``low
road.'' He abruptly dropped the friendly rhetoric, including the
word ``buddy,'' he sometimes used to use to describe McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And, as recently as nine days ago, Bush tried to dodge questions
about how he felt about his opponent. Asked by a reporter on March
1 whether he still considered McCain a friend, Bush equivocated.
``I consider that kind of campaigning to be unnecessary,'' he said
of the phone calls McCain campaign workers made to voters
describing Bush's visit to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters pressed a second time, he said: ``I know what the
question was. You must think I'm getting old. And the answer was, I
try not to take things personally in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But with his dominant showing in Tuesday's primaries _ taking
nine of the 13 GOP contests _ aides say Bush is aware of the
immediate need to court the voters who were so enthusiastic about
McCain. One Bush pollster said he wished he had been able to pose
an exit poll question to McCain voters nationwide: What was it that
you liked about his candidacy so much? And how is that going to
affect your vote this fall?
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, where are these voters going to find a
home?'' pollster Mark C. Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   That concern even showed up in Bush's victory speech, in which
he commended McCain for his ``commitment to reform.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, Bush nearly thanked McCain for having made him a
sharper candidate, calling himself ``battle-tested.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he hoped he could convince McCain to ``team up and
let's win. Let's beat Al Gore.'' But he admitted it would take time
and energy to repair his relationship with the Arizona senator,
given the tenor of the last 37 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the appropriate time, I will be talking to John (McCain) if
he wants to and reaching out to the people he energized,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides, who know their candidate has something Bush
needs, were in no mood to make nice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   En route to Cottonwood to meet McCain, who was to spend the day
resting and weighing his options with family, senior staffers and
friends at his ranch, aides were digging in their heels, determined
not to go gently into that good night.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is still an option, they said: not just staying in
the race or withdrawing, but also continuing in another way, though
they were vague about what that might include. Aides hinted at a
third party option, a possibility that has been batted about in
recent weeks, but which McCain has taken great pains to quash.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategist John Weaver took care to leave the
senator's choices open, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't conceive of John jumping to the Reform Party,'' Weaver
said. ``But I can certainly see him being pushed into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said he had not raised the third party idea with McCain,
and that,to his knowledge, no calls have come from Reform party
officials.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain were to throw his support behind Bush, it is likely
the senator would want to extract concessions from the governor,
some aides said. Particularly on the issue of campaign finance
reform, the issue which at times defined McCain's candidacy. That
might mean Bush would swear off soft money, and encourage Vice
President Al Gore to do the same, and move some of McCain's
priorities higher up in his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Aides seemed to be enjoying the nebulous nature of the situation
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is chaos, there is opportunity,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican strategist and Bush supporter Tom Rath said the
men, galvanized by Gore, have little choice but to reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will realize the alternative is Al Gore, whom neither of
them wants,'' he said. ``They will have to sit down and talk to
each other. They started out as friends and stayed friendly thru
New Hampshire. We're talking about four or five weeks out of much
longer political relationship, and they can find ways to patch that
up.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they don't reconcile, and McCain exits, moderate voters,
without an alternative to Bush, will move to the Texas governor
anyway, Rath said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's nature and demeanor are very inclusive,'' Rath said.
``And he can get to those people, especially if there's nobody else
out there competing for their attention. Every voter is an
independent contractor.''

   &UR; ONE MAN'S TALE OF THE GREELY EXPEDITION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   rt,10p10 Historian  &UR; Leonard Guttridge &LR; 's new book, ``Ghosts of
Cape Sabine'' (Putnam's; $27.95), tells the story of 25 American
soldiers who set forth in July 1881 to establish a scientific base
in the Arctic. Their saga, which ended in tragedy and the deaths of
19 of the 25, includes tales of starvation, mutiny, shipwreck,
execution and, as the book reveals, cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the central characters in the tale is  &UR; Frederick &LR; 
 &UR; Kislingbury &LR; , who began the expedition as second in command.
 &UR; Linda Kislingbury Cain &LR; , great-granddaughter of Kislingbury, lives
in Novato and owns many papers relating to the expedition,
including his diary and letters from him to her grandfather,
 &UR; Douglass Kislingbury &LR; . The letters reveal him to be a loving
father.
</P>
<P>
   On August 8, 1881, for example, the lieutenant wrote to his
7-year-old son describing the difficulty of navigation, the dangers
of ice floes, the shooting of a polar bear and attempts to hunt
seal.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, ``I have seen Santa Claus up here, Duggy, and have
made arrangements with him to have the Esquimaux make you a nice
pair of Esquimaux slippers. ... You must not be anxious about me if
ship does not reach us next year, as we have fully two years
supplies and can get back some way. I am in the very best of health
and weigh more than I ever did before. My appetite is inordinate
and am sanguine that I can get through this sort of life
successfully and unless afflicted with disease or sickness feel
that I shall come back a stronger and healthier man than ever.''

<P>
   Eventually, as the expedition started to fall apart, Kislingbury
challenged the authority of its leader,  &UR; Augustus &LR; 
 &UR; Greely &LR; . Eventually, he asked to be reassigned and was relieved of
his commission, &LR;  but missed the boat to go home, his only
opportunity. He died on June 3, 1884, of disease and starvation,
although just before his death, Greely reinstated him.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half months later, after the six survivors returned
home, rumors of cannibalism made front-page headlines in New York
newspapers. Kislingbury's exhumed body proved their truth.

GAINS SEEN FOR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Her name was not on any ballot, but one big winner in
Tuesday's primary may have been Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming US Senate race, which pits the First Lady against
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, was not a direct issue here, since both
candidates are running unopposed within their parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the results of the presidential contests, combined with a
between-the-lines reading of exit polls, suggests a boost for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The best news, from her vantage point, was that Vice President
Al Gore won by such a huge margin, beating Bill Bradley 65 to 34 in
the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week, it was a much-debated question whether Gore's
strengths would pull Clinton or whether Clinton would have to pull
Gore. The issue is now clearly settled: the coattails belong to
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Another bit of good news for Clinton is that Gore won bigger
still, by a 2-to-1 margin, among a group that has been strikingly
cool toward her _ white women.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest polls on the Senate race, Clinton and Giuliani are
virtually tied, but Giuliani leads among white women by an
astounding 51-37 margin. If Gore can bring some of them over to
vote a straight-Democratic ticket, that might be enough to pull the
First Lady over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton might also be encouraged by data on the Republican
primary. According to exit polls by the Voter News Service and the
Associated Press, one-third of Republicans who voted for Sen. John
McCain do not like Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Since McCain attracted 43 percent of the Republican voters _ not
much less than Bush's 51 percent _ that is a fairly substantial
chunk of potential defectors.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, party cross-overs work the other way, too. One-third
of Bradley voters do not care for Clinton. It is also worth noting
that 22 percent of Democratic voters have a favorable opinion of
Giuliani, while just 15 percent of Republican voters have a
favorable view of the First Lady.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent the primary provides much good news for Giuliani,
one bit may be how well McCain did in the mayor's biggest
stronghold of support _ the suburbs of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   McCain the insurgent beat Bush the party favorite in both of
Long Island's counties, Suffolk and Nassau _ a stunning rebuke to
the once-indisputable sway that the state party's machine held
there.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days before the primary, Giuliani refused to sign a
statement _ prepared by Republican Gov. George W. Pataki and
endorsed by nearly every other party bigwig _ attacking McCain on
his voting record. The mayor explained that, while he still
endorsed Bush, he was not going to betray his friendship with
McCain. It is a position that many McCain supporters _ apart from
the one-third who don't like Giuliani to begin with _ might
appreciate and remember in November.
</P>
<P>
   The only other districts where McCain won decisively on Tuesday
were Manhattan and Albany. These are Democratic strongholds, where
Clinton leads in the polls. But Giuliani enjoys more support there
than most other Republicans do, and his independent stance on
McCain might hold Clinton's margin at least somewhat in check.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Giuliani may suffer from the generally weak and
divided position in which the state Republican party finds itself,
post primary. Bush _ the candidate backed by the entire party
structure, from Pataki on down _ won two-thirds of the delegates
(beating McCain, 67-26) and a majority (though just barely) of the
popular vote. This might be considered a strong victory in some
states, but not in New York, where the Republican machine has
controlled primaries so tightly in the past that insurgents usually
don't get on the ballot at all or, when they do, don't win any
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``By New York standards, this was no blow-out,'' said Hank
Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant. ``Bush should have won a much
bigger majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican politicians privately agree.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the New York primary had two critical outcomes _
Gore's emergence as a very strong Democratic candidate who is
especially strong among women, and the appearance of seams and
rickets in the state's Republican party apparatus. ``Put them
together,'' Sheinkopf said, ``and the net gain goes to Hillary
Clinton.''

   &UR; ONE MAN'S TALE OF THE GREELY EXPEDITION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   rt,10p10 Historian  &UR; Leonard Guttridge &LR; 's new book, ``Ghosts of
Cape Sabine'' (Putnam's; $27.95), tells the story of 25 American
soldiers who set forth in July 1881 to establish a scientific base
in the Arctic. Their saga, which ended in tragedy and the deaths of
19 of the 25, includes tales of starvation, mutiny, shipwreck,
execution and, as the book reveals, cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the central characters in the tale is  &UR; Frederick &LR; 
 &UR; Kislingbury &LR; , who began the expedition as second in command.
 &UR; Linda Kislingbury Cain &LR; , great-granddaughter of Kislingbury, lives
in Novato and owns many papers relating to the expedition,
including his diary and letters from him to her grandfather,
 &UR; Douglass Kislingbury &LR; . The letters reveal him to be a loving
father.
</P>
<P>
   On August 8, 1881, for example, the lieutenant wrote to his
7-year-old son describing the difficulty of navigation, the dangers
of ice floes, the shooting of a polar bear and attempts to hunt
seal.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, ``I have seen Santa Claus up here, Duggy, and have
made arrangements with him to have the Esquimaux make you a nice
pair of Esquimaux slippers. ... You must not be anxious about me if
ship does not reach us next year, as we have fully two years
supplies and can get back some way. I am in the very best of health
and weigh more than I ever did before. My appetite is inordinate
and am sanguine that I can get through this sort of life
successfully and unless afflicted with disease or sickness feel
that I shall come back a stronger and healthier man than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, as the expedition started to fall apart, Kislingbury
challenged the authority of its leader,  &UR; Augustus &LR; 
 &UR; Greely &LR; . Eventually, he asked to be reassigned and was relieved of
his commission, &LR;  but missed the boat to go home, his only
opportunity. He died on June 3, 1884, of disease and starvation,
although just before his death, Greely reinstated him.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Just over a year ago, 18-year-old Tony Limon was a
proud senior starter for the Bobcats, the South San Antonio High
School basketball team, and weighing the offer of a college
basketball scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he sits in a Bexar County jail cell here, waiting for a
decision on Friday on whether a judge will reduce his five-year
prison sentence for assault. Limon threw an elbow into an
opponent's face in a basketball game, breaking the player's nose.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the sentence for Limon, who was already in
trouble with the law when the altercation took place, has surprised
many involved in school sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been isolated cases of civil lawsuits alleging that
a student used too much force in executing a play, but I've never
heard of a student being criminally charged before,'' said Robert
Kanaby, executive director of the National High School Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Alton Ballard, executive director of the Texas Association of
Basketball Coaches, said that in his 25 years with the association:
``This is a first. We've never seen a high school student or a
college student charged for something they did during a sporting
event.''
</P>
<P>
   In a jailhouse news conference last week, Limon accused his
coach, Gary Durbon, of encouraging the violence, saying Durbon told
him after the incident, ``It's about time someone drew some
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbon, who has coached for seven years at South San, as it is
called, denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is in a desperate situation and my name has been thrown
in as the scapegoat,'' Durbon said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident took place in January 1999, in a game between South
San and East Central High School of San Antonio. A videotape shows
Limon flagrantly striking Brent Holmes, an East Central guard, late
in the first half, and Holmes' head snapping backward before he
fell to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes also suffered a concussion and facial cuts. A month later
he filed an assault charge against Limon. Last week his parents
sued the South San Antonio School District and Durbon to recover
what they said was more than $6,000 in medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Limon stayed in the game, which East Central won, 100-73. Limon
scored 2 points and fouled out in the second half. After school
officials saw the videotape, however, he was suspended for the rest
of the season. Then legal authorities viewed the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the district attorney saw the video, he bumped the
charges from a simple assault to aggravated assault,'' said Jack
McGinnis II, one of Limon's lawyers, who came into the case after
the sentence. Also, the earlier legal problems of Limon contributed
to the sentence he received, said those involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month before the incident, he had been arrested at a
local shopping mall and charged with two counts of burglary. He
pleaded no contest and was placed on probation.
</P>
<P>
   When the assault charge came before the court last month, Limon
again pleaded no contest, expecting more probation, his lawyer
said. But on Feb. 7, District Court Judge Mark Luitjen sentenced
Limon to five years in prison. Luitjen did not return a phone call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas judicial process, Luitjen has until
Friday to enforce his sentence or to accept the more lenient
sentence of a brief time in jail followed by probation, both not to
exceed six months, which Limon's lawyers have requested.
</P>
<P>
   Although high school sports officials knew of no other such case
involving a criminal charge against a player during a
school-sanctioned sporting event, a Chicago teen-ager was charged
with battery last year for an incident seconds after a youth hockey
league game ended. In professional sports, a Canadian court on
Tuesday lodged one count of assault with a weapon against Marty
McSorley, a Boston Bruins defenseman, for an attack with a hockey
stick on a Vancouver player, Donald Brashear, on Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Durbon, whose father also coached at South San, said that none
of his other players had ever committed an act as violent as the
one by Limon.
</P>
<P>
   ``High school play is real physical these days, not that it
should be,'' Durbon said, ``but I've never had anything like this
happen before with any of my boys. I don't think Tony really
intended to hurt anybody. He just made a mistake that night and
went a little bit too far.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But McGinnis said the coaching staff at South San was at least
partly responsible for what happened, and he contrasted Limon's two
crimes to demonstrate what he said was the unfairness of the
sentence: ``In the burglary, Tony is nervous, he's worried about
being caught, he knows he's doing something wrong. But on the
basketball court, he's playing a game, he's being a teen-ager; he
obviously has no criminal intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after it happens, his teammates congratulate him, his
coach says `It was time for blood,' and they leave him in the game.
What does that tell a kid?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Durbon said that Limon was allowed to return to the game because
neither the coaches nor the officials saw the blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't teach that,'' Durbon said. ``We've never taught that.
The kids have always played within the rules until this.''
</P>
<P>
   But two former teammates of Limon's confirmed his version of the
events.
</P>
<P>
   One, Ray Pacheco, said he remembered clearly what happened when
the players returned to the huddle after Holmes was hurt. ``The
coach told Tony, `It's about time someone drew some blood,'''
Pacheco said. ``That's exactly what he said to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The other, Richard Gonzalez, said: ``Yeah, coach said it. He
always encouraged people to play real tough, to play real
physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Pacheco and Gonzalez, who were coached by Durbon for four
years at South San and remain friends of Limon, now attend
Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Mo., the same university that
offered Limon a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis still holds out the hope that the judge will reduce
Limon's sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid has one indiscretion off the court and one
indiscretion on the court,'' McGinnis said. ``Now, instead of going
to college and changing his life forever, he gets five years in
prison. Just think of the lost opportunity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Ray Leach, Holmes' lawyer in the civil suit against the
school district, said: ``People need to look at the vicious nature
of the crime and the criminal history of Limon that powered the
judge's sentence in this case. It was a brutal assault any way you
look at it. If it had happened on a street corner instead of a
basketball court, he would have been arrested on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family went through a lot of anguish. They still have
questions about actions of the coaching staff that may suggest
there are more people than just Limon who need to be brought to
account for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lawsuit and accusations, Durbon said he bears no ill
feeling toward Limon and that he, too, believes the sentence is
excessive. ``Five years is way too harsh,'' Durbon said. ``He
definitely needs to learn a lesson, but I don't think the boy is
going to learn anything in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not angry with him, and I wish him the best of luck.
Because he still is one of my boys,'' he said.

FIRED NURSE LOSES DISCRIMINATION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts board that regulates nursing has
dismissed a nurse's complaint that he was fired because he spoke up
about working conditions that he contended were unsafe for
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pointing out that we had undergone a downsizing and a
reduction in staffing, but we were expected to give the same
quality of care to patients, which is impossible,'' said nurse
Barry Adams. ``This is happening all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has attracted national attention among nurses because
of the issues they say it raises about the accountability of
nurse-managers who implement cost-cutting decisions to reduce
staffing or use inexperienced personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Adams filed charges against his supervisor, nurse Ann T. Poster,
alleging that her firing of him constituted unprofessional and
unethical behavior. He also alleged that she was guilty of patient
neglect for her role in overseeing a Cambridge, Mass. nursing home
unit where one patient died of an accidental morphine overdose and
other patients were victims of care-related mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and Poster worked at Youville Health Care Center, an
extended-care facility that has since closed.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the Board of Registration in Nursing said Adams
had failed to prove that Poster fired him in 1996 because of his
repeated complaints about unsafe working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa M. Bonanno, the nursing board's executive director, said
the board believed Poster when she testified that she fired Adams
for insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saying she fired him totally in retaliation,'' Bonanno
said. ``I must say, the board doesn't find that to be any more
credible than the reasons she put forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams and his supporters were dismayed by the board's decision.
His lawyers said they may challenge it in court, using a rarely
used mechanism called a writ of mandamus to reverse state agency
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Barry Adams case doesn't raise these larger issues,
then the public should ask what case would,'' said Suzanne Gordon,
a journalist who often writes about nursing issues.
</P>
<P>
   David Schildmeier, a spokesman for the 20,000-member
Massachusetts Nurses Association, said, ``We're just outraged by
the decision.'' The association brought about 100 nurses to the
board meeting and held a demonstration on the street outside.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and his supporters said the nursing board is protecting
nurse-managers, while holding staff nurses accountable for lapses
in patient care.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonnano said, ``There really are no facts to support that.''
He said board staff members recalled a dozen cases in the past two
years in which nurse-managers were charged with license
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   In making its decision, the nursing board reviewed nearly 1,000
pages of documentation, officials said, including the transcript of
a National Labor Relations Board hearing in 1997 in which Adams
successfully challenged Youville Health Care for firing him.
Federal Administrative Law Judge Arthur Amchan found that Adams'
firing was ``an illegal . . . attempt to silence and retaliate
against him'' and ordered Adams and two other nurses reinstated
with back pay.
</P>
<P>
   The board could not substantiate Adams' specific allegations of
inadequate staffing levels, Bonnano said. But Adams' attorneys
complained that the board selectively ignored some of his evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally we can't challenge the weight they accord to each
piece of evidence, but we can challenge them on grounds that they
didn't consider all the evidence,'' said Mala M. Rafik, an attorney
for Adams. ``They can't just ignore evidence as they see fit.''

SHOWDOWN IN PHILIPPINES BETWEEN PRESIDENT AND SECURITIES
REGULATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ A scandal in the Philippines over accusations that a
friend of President Joseph Estrada's engaged in insider trading
escalated Wednesday into a showdown between Estrada and the
country's top securities regulator.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his administration was considering legal
action against the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman,
Perfecto Yasay Jr., accusing Yasay of exceeding his authority by
ordering the stock market to close because of accusations that the
exchange was whitewashing an investigation into the case.
</P>
<P>
   Yasay had ordered the exchange not to reopen Wednesday after its
compliance department resigned on Tuesday. Department members
walked out to protest what they said were attempts by the exchange
to dismiss a report on price manipulation of the shares of the
gambling concern BW Resources. The report implicated eight local
brokerage firms and Dante Tan, a major shareholder close to
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Secretary Jose Pardo intervened, vowing to open the
exchange ``even if I have to open the doors myself.'' The
commission's four other members helped defuse the situation
somewhat by overruling Yasay's order, and Wednesday morning Pardo
appeared at the exchange in person to ring the opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   But without a compliance department, it is unclear who, if
anyone, is monitoring the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Yasay did could be called economic sabotage,'' Estrada
said in a radio interview. The president's press secretary, Rodolfo
Reyes, said the president's lawyers had advised him that Yasay's
actions were illegal and that Estrada could suspend the commission
chairman, whose term ends later this month. Yasay could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors applauded the decision to keep the market
open, but the feuding did little to restore confidence in the
government's economic stewardship. The benchmark stock index
dropped nearly 3 percent to a 16-month low, and the Philippine peso
slipped to its lowest level against the dollar this year. Investors
are concerned that the corruption endemic under former President
Ferdinand Marcos has returned with the 20-month-old Estrada
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crony capitalism was a big problem under Marcos,'' said
Deborah Schuler, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service in
Hong Kong. ``The concern has been that it perhaps is coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Philippines escaped the brunt of Asia's financial
crisis in 1997 and 1998, the recovery has been weakened by swelling
public debt second only to Indonesia's, according to J.P. Morgan.
Earlier this week, the country asked the International Monetary
Fund to extend its access to $650 million in new loans and won a
deal to obtain up to $1 billion more in financing from the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The insider trading accusations involving BW Resources are one
of several situations plaguing Estrada's administration. Last
month, for example, the interior secretary and the head of the
country's police were charged with trying to fix a contract.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown between Estrada and Yasay had been building for
some time. Relations between them had been tense since January,
when Yasay testified that Estrada had pressed him to clear Tan.
Estrada has denied placing any pressure on Yasay.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry began after BW Resources' shares rose 5,300 percent
just before it was announced on Oct. 11 that Stanley Ho, a Macao
gambling tycoon, would buy a 10 percent stake in the company and
become its chairman. The investment had been rumored for months,
and after the news, BW Resources' stock plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   The securities commission's report on the investigation, made
public last month, said there was enough evidence to support
charges of insider trading and price manipulation against Tan and
the brokerage firms. Tan has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter of resignation on Tuesday, Ruben Almadro, head of
the exchange's compliance department, accused exchange officials of
capitulating to political pressure and exonerating the companies
implicated in his department's report. The rest of the department
resigned in a separate letter of support for Almadro.

ECONOMIC SCENE: DEMISE OF LONG-HELD THEORY ON INFLATION AND
UNEMPLOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story was sent and then  HELD on MARCH 1.  This version
is now released for publication.) 
(Eds: J. Bradford DeLong is a professor of economics at the
University of California at Berkeley and co-editor of The Journal
of Economic Perspectives.)

 By J. BRADFORD DE LONG    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever happened to the Phillips curve?
</P>
<P>
   You remember the Phillips curve, the relationship between
unemployment and inflation proposed by the British economist A.W.
Phillips in the late 1950s and developed into its present form in
the late 1960s by Edward Phelps and Milton Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 25 years mainstream economists' forecasts have
rested on the idea that should unemployment fall below an unknown
(but very real) level called the natural rate of unemployment, then
inflation would start to rise. And inflation would keep on rising
further until unemployment climbed back to or above its natural
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the Phillips curve is missing. All of a sudden,
economists are a lot less useful as forecasters. For as it stands
now, economists' forecasts of economic growth, unemployment and
inflation are no longer projections based on historical patterns
but, instead, pure guesses based on gut feelings about when, how,
and if the Phillips curve will return.
</P>
<P>
   If economists are to be of any use for forecasting, they need to
come up with a better _ and probably more complex _ theory about
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   When last seen during the 1990-92 recession, the Phillips curve
looked very healthy. In the second half of the 1980s the
unemployment rate fell to a low of 5.3 percent in 1989 and
inflation, which had averaged 2.4 percent a year in 1984-87, picked
up to 4.1 percent a year and rising by early 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Back then the Federal Open Market Committee _ under the
leadership of Alan Greenspan, who was relatively new as chairman at
the time _ reacted sharply by pushing up interest rates. Tighter
monetary policy and the shock to expectations from the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait caused total spending to fall. Unemployment rose
above its natural rate to a peak of 7.6 percent in June 1992. And
inflation fell.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the end of the 1980s knew exactly what the natural
rate of unemployment was. But even the most optimistic did not
think it could be lower than 5.5 percent, and even the most
pessimistic knew it could be no higher than 6.5 percent. Still, the
end of the 1980s retaught the lesson that the Phillips curve was
very real and had to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   That is why officials in the Clinton administration and the
Federal Reserve, as well as independent analysts, bit their
fingernails throughout the 1990s as they awaited the return of
rising inflation. By 1994 unemployment _ at 6.1 percent _ was in
the range where inflation had started to accelerate in the late
1980s, so the Fed spoke of undertaking pre-emptive strikes against
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no inflation followed. By 1996 the unemployment rate was as
low as it had ever been in the 1980s. Yet inflation fell to less
than 2 percent a year. By 1999 unemployment was at 4.2 percent _
well below anyone's previous estimate of the natural rate _ yet
inflation was an even-lower 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Where was the Phillips curve? There was confidence until the end
of 1997 that the Phillips curve would soon return. Temporary
special factors _ health care costs, rapid falls in computer prices
and so on _ were momentarily retarding the tendency of inflation to
rise when unemployment was lower than its natural rate.
</P>
<P>
   Such factors could not last forever, could they? Of course not.
So when their influence came to an end, inflation would begin its
rise. But years passed, and inflation did not rise.
</P>
<P>
   So mainstream economists' opinion shifted to the belief that the
natural rate of unemployment had fallen, though how far no one
really knew.
</P>
<P>
   Economists began spinning theories of what had caused the
natural rate to fall. James Medoff of Harvard began arguing in the
early 1990s that technological and organizational changes had led
the labor market to do a better job of matching workers needing
jobs to vacancies, thus substantially lowering the natural rate.
Others pointed to faster productivity growth that allowed higher
wage increases to be consistent with relative price stability.
Still others pointed to workers' fears for their jobs generated by
the memory of the recession and layoffs of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at some primal level, economists continue to believe in
something like a Phillips curve. They believe that unemployment
will fall if demand expands faster than the economy's long-run
productive capacity. And they believe that if demand keeps
expanding faster than the economy's long-run productive capacity
then, in the long run, inflation will rise.
</P>
<P>
   It is just, they kept saying, that the natural rate of
unemployment _ the signal that this long run had arrived _ has
fallen mysteriously far and mysteriously fast.
</P>
<P>
   But, truth be told, the Phillips curve has not worked well
outside America. Only in the United States has there been a
relatively stable natural rate of unemployment to serve as a
reliable indicator of when demand pressure is about to raise
inflation. Elsewhere, the causes of rising inflation have always
been too complex to be summarized by simply comparing unemployment
to even a semistable natural rate.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the United States, Douglas Staiger, Mark Watson and
James Stock pointed out in the Journal of Economic Perspectives,
the Phillips curve relationship was never as strong or as good at
forecasting inflation as was taught in intermediate macroeconomics.
</P>
<P>
   Thus perhaps the surprising thing is not that forecasts of
inflation based on the Phillips curve have gone awry the last half
decade. Perhaps the surprising thing is that the complicated
economic processes determining changes in inflation could be
summarized for so long by such a simple relationship as the
standard Phillips curve.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it is now clear that the simple theory of the
relation between inflation and unemployment that economists have
peddled for a quarter-century no longer works. If economists are to
be of any use, they need to come up with a better _ and in all
likelihood more sophisticated _ approach to understanding why
inflation rises.

PATENT ISSUE DIVIDES GENOME RESEARCHERS, DRUG COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The final phase of the Human Genome Project _ billed as
potentially the greatest advance in the history of medical science
_ has erupted into a tense war of words between federal researchers
racing to complete the task and the flamboyant president of a
biotech startup who wants to profit by giving drug companies an
early, private look at the genetic data.
</P>
<P>
   J. Craig Venter, president of Celera Genomics Corp., in an
interview with The Boston Globe Wednesday, charged the federal
government's US Human Genome Research Institute with wanting to
foil his business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Celera and the institute are both trying to complete the massive
task of deciphering all the DNA data in the human blueprint.
Scheduled to be finished later this year, the completed genome is
expected to spark new and radical advancements in medical
treatment, therapies and cures for diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The competitors chose widely different approaches in handling
the data. The government maintains that the DNA data should
immediately go into a public database where all can use it. Celera,
on the other hand, argues that unless drug companies can exert
patent rights over the gene data, they will not have an incentive
to invest in costly development of the new drugs and treatments
that the gene information could make possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government is working against the public and
against the US health system,'' said Venter, by insisting that the
gene sequence data be made public as soon as it's been obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Venter also said the dispute ``isn't about economics, it's about
who gets credit'' for deciphering the human genome, the largest
biology project ever undertaken. Celera, a company only 18 months
old which has already achieved a scientific milestone by
deciphering all the genes of the fruit fly, has developed a faster
method of reading out the DNA information in cells than the
techniques used by the government-funded genome centers, one of
which is in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Cambridge genome center, Eric Lander, suggested
earlier that Celera and the national genome institute, which is
headed by Dr. Francis S. Collins, collaborate on the final DNA
readouts rather than competing.
</P>
<P>
   But talks on the plan have been more off than on for months.
Most recently, a human genome project negotiating team and Celera
officials met last Dec. 29 in an effort to agree on basic terms for
working together.
</P>
<P>
   The mood after the meeting was ``pessimistic,'' said Kathy
Hudson, a policy official at the genome institute, in an interview.
Venter said that one reason things went sour was because Lander, a
highly respected geneticist at the Whitehead Institute in
Cambridge, was very reasonable about Celera's position and
therefore was ``kicked off'' the genome negotiating team. Hudson
responded that Lander was never on the team. Lander did not return
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the discouraging meeting, genome officials made
``innumerable attempts'' to reach Venter later to continue
discussions, but got no response, said Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said he had been traveling and had tried to call Collins
on more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, an exchange of letters between the government center
and Celera has accomplished nothing except to harden their
respective positions.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said that the negotiating team had not had a chance to
review Celera's March 7 letter in which it said its only
restriction is that ``other database providers would be prohibited
from providing or selling Celera's data as their own.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Venter said that Celera only wants to patent a
few hundred of the estimated 80,000 to 100,000 genes that are being
deciphered in the genome project. Celera's business plan, he said,
is to sell subscriptions enabling drug companies (at a cost of $5
million a year) and academic centers (at a much lower cost) to use
not only the raw gene data but Celera's high-powered computers and
methods of analyzing the function of the genes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the subscription plan, the companies have a certain length
of time to sift through the data and apply for patents before other
companies get to see the data. The genome institute objects to any
collaboration with Celera under which the company would be able to
exclude the public from the data.
</P>
<P>
   According to current estimates, the national genome center will
publish a ``rough draft'' of the human genome by this spring. A
rough draft would include about 90 percent of the DNA blueprint,
and a final, detailed version would be ready by 2003 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Celera says it will have most of the genome sequence deciphered
by the end of this year.

BRADLEY, DREAM DEFERRED, EXPECTED TO DROP OUT OF RACE

   ``The taste of defeat has a richness of experience all its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Bradley, in his 1976 memoir, ``Life on the Run'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Bradley was richer Wednesday for what he is
not: a charismatic orator, a brash street brawler, a master
strategist who could whet a national yearning and wring from it
personal glory.
</P>
<P>
   For all that and a wider web of circumstances and character
quirks, Bradley is expected to grudgingly end his quest for a job
that others had told him since he was too young to vote would one
day be his.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will not be president, not now, maybe never. After a
15-month odyssey marked by flashes of brilliant promise amid
periods of languorous stumping, the former basketball star and US
senator will announce Thursday he has exhausted this phase of his
public life and will endorse the target of his renegade run for the
Democratic nomination, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The ``joyous journey'' Bradley launched last year in a living
room in Jaffrey, N.H., will officially expire when he promises
supporters near his New Jersey headquarters that the ``new
politics'' he sought to nurture will some day flourish in America,
even if he is absent from the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't our time,'' a top Bradley supporter said
Wednesday, reflecting Bradley's views. ``But the cause isn't
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, though, 2000 could have been Bradley's time.
But for a rash of strategic miscues and Bradley's rigid reluctance
to depart from his original script, the campaign might have turned
his way.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he would have risked failure in November with a
largely liberal agenda of sweeping antipoverty, health care and gun
control initiatives at a time when polls show the public hungers
for little more than marginal change. He planted the seeds of his
demise in January.
</P>
<P>
   After soaring in the polls in late 1999 on the strength of a
stunning fund-raising effort and glossy news coverage, Bradley
squandered his crucial edge by wasting precious weeks and a million
dollars in a futile attempt to crack Gore's impenetrable hold on
the party apparatus and labor unions that control the Iowa
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Bradley clung so dearly to the ``radical
premise'' that he could prove the power of ``big ideas'' without
dirtying himself in the political maelstrom that he allowed Gore to
pummel him with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   The worst he would say of Gore, for example, is that ``my
opponent says he is for campign finance reform, yabada, yabada,
yada.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, like a storm-ravaged scarecrow in an Iowa cornfield,
showed no pluck. He shunned urgent calls from his advisers to storm
back, appearing more intent on martyring himself for passive
politics than becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he effectively gave credence to Gore's portrayal of him
as a quitter who viewed politics more as an academic exercise than
a field of action. And polls showed that Bradley's campaign entered
a devastating tailspin after a debate on Jan. 9, when he failed to
counter Gore's false claim that Bradley in 1993 had opposed
disaster relief for Iowa farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening his crisis, Bradley offered only meek protests as Gore
pounded him on the issue for days in television ads. And Bradley's
advisers, helplessly watching him founder, could do little but
despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics, you don't do everything perfectly,'' his
spokesman, Eric Hauser, said amid the fall. ``Sometimes they don't
happen the way you want them to.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet one woe seemed to beget another, most notably Bradley's
awkward disclosures about his irregular heartbeat. Rather than
fully disclose from the start his relatively common condition,
atrial fibrillation, Bradley hewed to what he once described as his
``natural antipathy to the invasion by the press of all the aspects
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he attracted outsized attention when he canceled an event
in California in December to seek treatment for an episode and
again when he disclosed in Iowa in January that he had experienced
four more erratic heartbeats. And he hardly helped himself by
diagnosing a highly unscientific cause of the recurrences: his
consumption of diet cream soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart thing did him in,'' said Bob Hynes, a retired
electrician and Bradley supporter from Boston, after Bradley spoke
last month at a health center. ``He can't win because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley later conceded he was stunned by a New Hampshire poll
that showed nearly one in five voters considered his heart
condition a serious issue.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached New Hampshire in late January, Bradley
had conceded to Gore his comfortable edge in the state. Worse, the
error of Bradley's Iowa strategy was embodied by Arizona Senator
John McCain, who snubbed Iowa to trumpet his message of reform in
New Hampshire while Bradley, the self-fashioned Democratic
reformer, languished out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had stolen the Granite State spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever do this again,'' one of Bradley's top aides said at
the time, ``we'll never go back to Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bradley had his best days in New Hampshire when he
finally abandoned his professorial mien and savaged Gore as
flip-flopping opportunist who was short on honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks helped Bradley close Gore's double-digit lead and
nearly erase it by primary night. But as McCain surged to victory
in the GOP race, he siphoned off legions of independents who
otherwise could have provided the additional five points Bradley
needed to topple Gore and seize the momentum himself.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the momentum was McCain's. The magazine covers. The
front pages. The nightly news shots. Everything was McCain's. For
the next five weeks, Bradley was a footnote in the race for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been off the radar screen since New Hampshire,'' a key
Bradley supporter, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, said recently.
``And it's hard to win anything if nobody can see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley compounded the Iowa debacle with a similarly doomed
decision to invest five valuable days trying to win a nonbinding,
largely inconsequential primary in Washington state on Feb. 29. The
strategy backfired badly as Bradley was throttled in Washington and
lost so much ground elsewhere that he all but shut down his
campaign a week before the decisive round of primaries on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, no one could help him. Not Michael Jordan, the
basketball icon who endorsed him in television commercials. Not
Harvard professor Cornel West, who lauded Bradley's push for racial
unity by declaring, ``Martin Luther King smiles down on this man.''
Not Matt Henshon, the Boston lawyer who served as Bradley's ``body
man,'' guiding him through every thicket of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley appealed to black voters, and they overwhelmingly backed
Gore. He called for eradicating childhood poverty, and the poor
largely shunned him, according to exit polls. He advocated making
health care accessible to all Americans, but the voters who most
warmed to his message were upper-income families who harbored few
anxieties about affording health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, Bradley scored highest among voters who
yearned for new ideas and an honest leader. And he never stopped
asking audiences, young and old, ``What is your dream, for
yourself, your community and your country?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, Bradley's dream is deferred, if not defunct.

&HT;     SENATE ENDS FILIBUSTER ON CALIFORNIA JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of waiting, two controversial
Californians appear sure to get their day in court _ and their days
on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday ended a filibuster led by conservative
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., against Richard Paez, a U.S. District Court
judge in Los Angeles, and San Francisco lawyer Marsha Berzon. Both
are nominees for seats on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Votes on their nominations are expected Thursday, and both are
expected to win Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   Paez has been waiting four years for a vote, longer than any
federal judicial nominee in modern history. Berzon, who specializes
in federal appeals cases and sits on the board of the American
Civil Liberties Union, was nominated more than two years ago. The
9th circuit court covers California and eight other Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's two-day filibuster was crushed by an 86-13 vote largely
because it lacked the support of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., who promised Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., last November
that he would bring the two nominations to the Senate floor by
March 15. Buoyed by Lott's stance, Senate Democrats were able to
persuade most of their Republican colleagues to join them in ending
the filibuster. The overwhelming majority for stopping it was far
greater than the 60 votes needed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the expected vote Thursday, Boxer said, ``This vote
has been much too long in coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate officials predicted that both Paez and Berzon, who have
the support of all 45 Senate Democrats, would win easily. Berzon
has appeared to have a comfortable number of Republican supporters
all along, but until this week Paez faced a close vote.
</P>
<P>
   The jurist picked up several key Republican endorsements on
Tuesday and Wednesday, including those of Sens. Orrin Hatch of
Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee; Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank my Republican colleagues who I hope have shown the
light to other Republican senators,'' Boxer said. In fact, Sens.
Robert Bennett of Utah, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, James
Jeffords of Vermont and Gordon Smith of Oregon are said to be
leaning toward approval of the Californians.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives who have fought Paez and Berzon say they are
too liberal and would only add to an already liberal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 9th Circuit (Court of Appeals) is a big enough problem as
it is without appointing two more liberal judges to it,'' Smith
said in Wednesday's filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Paez of being a judicial activist, Sen. Jeffrey
Sessions, R-Ala., said he ``obviously believes that when a law
doesn't suit him, he has the right not to enforce it fully.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats noted that Paez has publicly stated he is against
any form of judicial activism.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also insisted that the liberal tag has been
unfairly applied to Paez and Berzon and that both in fact are
mainstream legal scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two candidates would be amazing assets to the 9th
Circuit Court, and I hope my Republican colleagues will make that
happen,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that Hatch has called Berzon is one of the most
qualified nominees he has ever seen and that Domenici on Wednesday
said that ``the time had come for Mr. Paez to be appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Domenici is right,'' Boxer said. ``The time has come.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Salvador Silva often used to worry that immigration
agents would raid the commercial laundry where he works. If they
did, he had a plan. He would jump onto a table, hoist himself into
an air-conditioning duct, and hide there until the agents left. He
practiced this more than once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived with the uncertainty of raids,'' said Silva, 26, who
has worked illegally in this country for 10 years, ever since he
walked across a bridge from Juarez in Mexico to El Paso, Texas, and
flew to Chicago to join a brother. Only now is he beginning to
relax. ``For the first time,'' he said, ``I don't fear the raids.''
</P>
<P>
   Such raids have all but stopped around the country over the last
year. In a booming economy running short of labor, hundreds of
thousands of illegal immigrants are increasingly tolerated in the
nation's workplaces. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has
made crossing the border harder than ever, stepping up patrols and
prosecuting companies that smuggle in aliens or blatantly recruit
them. But once inside the country, illegal immigrants are now
largely left alone. Even when these people are discovered, arrests
for the purpose of deportation are much less frequent; such arrests
dropped to about 8,600 last year from 22,000 just two years
earlier, the INS reports.
</P>
<P>
   The INS now concentrates on picking up aliens who have committed
crimes. The rest are, in effect, allowed to help American employers
fill jobs. ``It is just the market at work, drawing people to jobs,
and the INS has chosen to concentrate its actions on aliens who are
a danger to the community,'' said Robert L. Bach, the agency's
associate commissioner for policy and planning.
</P>
<P>
   This greater acceptance of illegal immigrants in the work force
helps explain why overall wage increases have been less than many
economists and policy makers had expected, given an unemployment
rate of only 4 percent and a strong demand for people to fill jobs
that pay $8 an hour or less, which is 25 percent of all jobs.
Immigrants _ legal and illegal _ have fed the pool of people
available to take these lower-paying jobs. But Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress last month that as
job growth expands, the pool keeps shrinking. That is one reason
why the Fed is raising interest rates to slow the economy before
wage pressures become inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and many other economists, though, are looking only at
people living in this country, including an estimated 6 million
illegal immigrants, as potential candidates to feed that pool. But
the number of illegal immigrants available to fill vacant jobs
might be much higher than the estimate, in part because of the more
tolerant INS policy. This policy may be inducing more workers to
immigrate, particularly from Mexico, because _ once they manage to
get here _ they will face less risk in taking a job. That would
dilute the labor shortage _ and the wage pressure that worries
Greenspan. In fact, it may already be doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us really knows how big the pool of available workers
is,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic
Policy Institute, ``but the more lenient stance can only increase
the number of people available abroad for jobs in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial laundry industry in Chicago, where Silva works,
clearly benefits from the Immigration Service's live-and-let-work
approach. Thirty companies wash and iron the city's hospital and
restaurant linens, hotel sheets and towels, factory uniforms and
the like. Half of their 2,800 employees are illegal immigrants,
mainly Hispanics, according to Unite, the union that has organized
most of them in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Unite negotiated contracts that recognize the illegal
status of some workers, and shield them. One clause requires an
employer to bar an INS raid unless the agents have a search
warrant. And a company must notify the union if it gets wind of a
coming raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I did not want to go to work,'' Silva said. ``I saw
reports on TV of immigration raids and people being led away, and I
worried that would happen to me. Now the union contract is
reassuring, and I no longer see raids on television.''
</P>
<P>
   A third clause states that when former employees are rehired
with new papers _ even new names _ after their original documents
are found to be false, they retain their seniority and resume their
old pay level. Union scale goes as high as $8.75 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Immigration Service has never had the resources to arrest
every illegal alien, and now there is a large number and a demand
from many companies to employ them,'' said Brian R. Perryman, the
agency's district director in Chicago, adding, ``Once they come
into the Chicago metropolitan area, with its 6.5 million people, it
is hard to stop the process.''
</P>
<P>
   A downturn in the booming economy and any resulting uptick in
unemployment could spur the INS to revive its pursuit of illegal
immigrants at work. Even now, some members of Congress,
particularly Rep. Lamar Smith, are pushing for legislation that
would step up efforts to prevent illegal immigrants from working in
the United States. Certainly, the more open policy today stands in
sharp contrast to the 1980s and even the mid-1990s, when
unemployment was higher and Pat Buchanan ran for president partly
on the issue of immigrants displacing American workers.
</P>
<P>
   But right now the route to work is fairly smooth. One reason is
that employment laws are easy for illegal immigrants to evade.
Workers are required by law to offer proof of eligibility _ a
Social Security card and a picture ID. But counterfeits are easily
purchased for $60 to $80 in this city's immigrant neighborhoods, a
favorite being a rose-colored resident alien card, which two
immigrants showed to this reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The laminated cards displayed photographs that were accurate but
fingerprints the workers said were not theirs. ``The birth date
isn't mine either, or the signature, although the name is right,''
said Angel Hernandez Lopez, a 25-year-old Mexican. ``For $80, they
do everything,'' he said of the counterfeiters.
</P>
<P>
   Employers can be fined for knowingly hiring illegal workers, but
they also risk being sued for discrimination if they challenge
documents that on the surface seem authentic. What's more, the
Social Security Administration checks only once a year for numbers
that fail to match legitimate pension accounts, and when it finds a
discrepancy, it never assumes it is immigrant fraud as opposed to a
mismatch resulting from a divorce, a job switch or a name changed
through marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that illegal immigrants are a factor,'' said Norman
Goldstein, a senior financial executive at Social Security, ``but I
cannot quantify for you how that factor compares with other
factors.''
</P>
<P>
   When a letter calling attention to a discrepancy does finally go
out, it goes to the employer or the employee, or both, but not the
Immigration Service, which cannot by law be privy to tax matters.
Even when the INS does get involved, the employee is now usually
given time to correct the problem. For illegal workers that means
time to change names, get new papers or change jobs.
</P>
<P>
   An illegal immigrant is at little risk these days, Bach said,
``unless the employer turns a worker in, and employers usually do
that only to break a union or prevent a strike or that kind of
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Curtailing undocumented workers, then, rests as much with
employers as with the INS, and in an economy short of workers,
employers are not rushing into action. On the contrary, they want
the INS to go easier as well on highly skilled, college-educated
immigrants _ the engineers, chemists, computer experts and college
professors who now enter the country on special H-1B visas. A
coalition of business groups is lobbying Congress to raise the
ceiling on these visas to 195,000 a year from 115,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, immigration at all levels would be
entirely market-driven, with appropriate protections of course for
native workers,'' said Sandra J. Boyd, an assistant vice president
at the National Association of Manufacturers, who leads the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Short of this goal, the temporary help agencies that have sprung
up in storefronts in Chicago's Hispanic neighborhoods are
benefiting from the new leniency. The $5.15-an-hour minimum-wage
jobs these agencies offer are usually the first that arriving
immigrants manage to land. They have settled by the thousands in
old blue-collar neighborhoods like Pilsen, southwest of the Loop.
Their growing presence in this city has given Illinois the nation's
fifth-largest immigrant population, behind California, New York,
Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Six temp agencies near West 18th Street and Blue Island Avenue,
in the heart of Pilsen, become predawn gathering places for
immigrants seeking work. More than 30 waited expectantly one day in
late February at Ron's Temporary Help Services, some perched in
what was once the window display of this former store. An old iron
radiator heated the room.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants, mostly from Mexico, hoped that Gloria de la
Torre, the 36-year-old manager _ herself an illegal immigrant until
three years ago, she says _ will favor them with one of the jobs
that go out by the thousands each day from 100 agencies like Ron's
in Hispanic neighborhoods. That is up from 50 in 1985, according to
Nik Theodore, director of research at the Center for Urban Economic
Development at the University of Illinois' Chicago campus.
</P>
<P>
   During the peak demand for these workers, from April through
September, more than 30,000 a day are placed by the temp agencies,
Theodore says, basing his estimate on his field research. The Ron's
office that de la Torre manages sends out 1,000 workers over three
shifts in those months, she says. But in late February, the flow is
down to 100 a day, and two vans are double parked outside waiting
to take some immigrants to jobs in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The temp agencies deal in a great variety of work _ assembling
coolers, eyeglass cases and other products, making sandwiches for
airline meals, stuffing envelopes, construction, packaging
perfumes, painting machinery, staffing warehouses that ship
merchandise ordered over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is a regular customer, using workers from the temp
agencies to pack computer monitors in shipping cartons, among other
tasks. The agencies, not Motorola, have the responsibility for
making certain that the people sent to Motorola are legally
authorized to work, a Motorola press officer said.
</P>
<P>
   The people de la Torre sends out all present her with the
necessary documents, which she accepts at face value. Daily or
weekly pay checks come with stubs that detail deductions for taxes,
Social Security and, for those who travel in vans to their jobs,
$3.50 a day for transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been visited by Immigration,'' de la Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the precarious status of an illegal immigrant makes them
easy victims for exploitation, the AFL-CIO charges. They are
filling the low-wage jobs readily enough, but they lack the
bargaining power to get higher on the pay scale, or upgrade their
working conditions, the labor organization says. That is a big
reason they are sought by employers, it adds.
</P>
<P>
   Unite's contracts covering laundry workers are designed to
protect illegal immigrants while raising their pay and getting them
benefits. Last month, the AFL-CIO also called for the legalization
of those already in the country, so they can be more easily
represented.
</P>
<P>
   The present system ``puts a club in the hands of employers,''
said David Smith, the AFL-CIO's director of policy. Bach, the
Immigration official, agrees. ``Workers are supposed to make gains
in tight labor markets,'' he said, ``but what you are seeing is
employers using illegal immigrants to undercut the expectations of
labor.''

   ``Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton'' &QL;

<P>
   by Barbara Olson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Biography &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regnery, $27.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look at a copy of ``Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary
Rodham Clinton,'' and the cover photo reveals that this will not be
a flattering portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Between the covers, former Travelgate federal prosecutor Barbara
Olson takes an unabashedly critical look at Clinton and her liberal
political background.
</P>
<P>
   The book attempts to chronicle what Olson calls Clinton's
``lifelong motivation'' for political power by describing key
turning points: her work on Watergate, her decision to move to
Arkansas and marry Bill Clinton, and, of course, her participation
in the Whitewater real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   Olson introduces chapters with quotes from Saul Alinksy's
``Rules for Radicals,'' using the quotes as guiding themes. Olson
provides some new anecdotes about Clinton, such as the time she
tried to enlist in the Marine Corps, but not enough to avoid mostly
rehashing public knowledge. In particular, Olson relies heavily on
quotes from White House advisers and the first lady's friends _
quotes that we've often read elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell to Pay'' suffers from the lack of substantial original
research to back up Olson's acerbic observations. Those
observations will therefore fall flat with readers, other than
those willing to hate the first lady anytime, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Olson does offer several insights into Clinton's determined,
focused support of her husband's political aspirations as a way to
further her own platform.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Olson points out that Clinton tirelessly campaigned
to have her husband re-elected governor of Arkansas after he lost
the office in 1980. As soon as his new term began, she grabbed the
limelight as chairwoman of a commission to upgrade the state
educational system. Personal ambition was obviously not lacking.
</P>
<P>
   However, Olson lets her personal views color her writing so much
that she weakens her presentation for objective readers. ``Hell to
Pay'' is essentially a caricature of Hillary Clinton as a
power-obsessed liberal, just like the distorted photo on the
cover. &QL;

 &HT;    Voters fail to embrace Bradley's `radical' notion
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometime after he lost the New Hampshire primary,
Bill Bradley dropped a stock phrase from his standard pitch to
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is based on the radical premise,'' he had
frequently intoned, ``that you can say what you believe and win.''
</P>
<P>
   The homily embodied the new style of politics that Bradley said
he wanted to bring the country when he announced his insurgent
challenge to Vice President Al Gore in December 1998, promising
bold solutions to a few big problems.
</P>
<P>
   But following Tuesday night's drubbing across the country and
his expected withdrawal from the race today, it is clear that
Bradley badly overestimated the receptiveness of Democratic voters
to his message. And he failed to fully appreciate one of the cold
truths about American politics: Voters also want to like the
messenger.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems clear that Bradley's storied career as an Olympic
gold medalist, Rhodes scholar and NBA basketball player _ what
attracted so many core believers to his campaign _ was not enough
to overcome the reserved, cerebral demeanor he exhibited as a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake for a candidate to be as closed and as private
and as opaque as Bradley was,'' said Richard Winters, political
science chairman at Dartmouth University. ``Presidential candidates
have to appeal on a visionary level ... but I think they also have
to appeal on an emotional level. I don't think people felt
comfortable about Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bradley's legendary discipline and focus _ the personal
qualities that led him into the NBA Hall of Fame and into the U.S.
Senate _ became liabilities. From the outset, Bradley said he was
going to run only on his terms. He would talk about the issues he
cared about, and present them in a way that ``showed respect to the
American people.'' He could not and would not change his game plan,
even when it became clear that it wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of tactical rigidity loses battles,'' said Ross
Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist who has followed
Bradley's career for 25 years. ``You have to be able to depart from
the master plan. He seemed to just follow it very diligently.''
</P>
<P>
   It will always remain an open question whether Bradley _ or any
candidate _ could have defeated a sitting vice president at a time
of record prosperity and unemployment. No candidate has ever done
it in modern political history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact remains that we came within 5,000 votes of beating a
sitting vice president in New Hampshire,'' said Anita Dunn,
Bradley's commutations director and one of his top advisers. Dunn
blamed Bradley's defeat on the difficulty he had getting national
media attention after the New Hampshire primary, when press
attention was focused on Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the message or the messenger were ever heard,'' Dunn
said. ``In the absence of hearing the message, voters went with the
known candidate, which was the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Bradley's strategy was premised on the gamble that Gore
would not emerge from President Clinton's shadow and that voters
would tar him with Clinton's scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gore, spurred by Bradley's early challenge, emerged as
a fierce competitor. He ditched his staid Washington wardrobe,
adopted a combative style of campaigning and captured the backing
of key Democratic voting blocs.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's help, Gore secured the endorsements of organized
labor, the teacher's unions, prominent gay and lesbian groups and
leaders in the pro-abortion rights movement. African-American and
Latino voters remained loyal to Gore, despite Bradley's success in
wooing a few African-American celebrities to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a referendum on the Clinton administration on the
policy side,'' said David Bositis, senior political analyst at the
Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. ``That made it all
but impossible to beat Gore unless something really bad happened to
discredit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the long odds, Bradley's margin for error was always
tiny.
</P>
<P>
   The first decisive blow occurred Oct. 13, 1999, when the AFL-CIO
endorsed Gore after intense lobbying from Gore and Clinton. Labor's
endorsement carried manpower and resources. Exit polling in Iowa,
New Hampshire and the Super Tuesday states showed that Gore carried
union voters by wide margins.
</P>
<P>
   The labor endorsement was followed by a tactical blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike McCain, who completely ignored the Iowa caucuses and
instead focused on New Hampshire and South Carolina, Bradley
invested heavily in the Hawkeye State, hoping to exceed
expectations in a state that tilts heavily toward the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   More costly for his campaign, however, was that Bradley himself
spent almost three solid weeks in Iowa before the Jan. 24 caucuses.
He left Iowa a loser _ Gore trounced him by a 2-1 ratio _ and
arrived in New Hampshire with only eight days to generate new
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Paindiris, Bradley's Connecticut coordinator, said he
lobbied the campaign to get Bradley back to New Hampshire, where
his presence could also have had an impact on New England states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missed opportunity was not staying in New Hampshire when
he was ahead,'' said Paindiris. ``That was a misstep.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, spent most of January in New Hampshire,
campaigning hard against the ``iron triangle'' of Washington
special interests and claiming Bradley's reform mantle for his own.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus was generating
huge crowds and excitement. Bradley was slow to recognize McCain's
threat and struggled over how to counter Gore's daily attacks
against his health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Five days before the primary, Bradley began an offensive against
Gore during a televised debate, questioning his integrity and
veracity on abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   And only after New Hampshire did Bradley begin to contrast
himself to McCain. On the day New Hampshire voted, independents
helped propel McCain to a stunning 19-point victory over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley did not show a willingness to be assertive and
tough and aggressive until too late,'' said Kathy Sullivan,
chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. ``People say they
don't like negative campaigning, but you still have to have that
willingness to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's big win over Bush, coupled with Bradley's four-point
loss to Gore, set Bradley on a course for almost certain defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain stole the thunder as the reformer,'' said former New
York City Mayor Ed Koch, a Bradley supporter.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also stole all the press attention, pushing Bradley off
the nightly news and deep into the media void.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for some renewed momentum, Bradley devoted six days to
winning Washington state's nonbinding primary Feb. 29. The loss
there only seemed to reinforce the idea that he couldn't win,
accelerating the perception that his campaign was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sucking for oxygen,'' said Pete D'Alessandro, who
helped direct Bradley's Iowa campaign, explaining the Washington
state strategy. ``That was where the next fight was, and we went
after it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Washington state loss, Bradley dropped his
counter-attacks on Gore and returned to the positive campaign he
had set out to run. Bradley's on-again, off-again strategy of
countering Gore's attacks remains a subject of intense disagreement
among his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had started attacking Gore a week earlier in New
Hampshire, he would have won New Hampshire and from there things
would have been different,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), a
Bradley supporter. ``Six weeks of not responding was a fundamental
error.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bradley did attack Gore, first on his truthfulness
and then on his Democratic credentials, accusing him of being soft
on tobacco policy, abortion rights, gun control and affirmative
action. But the attacks always seemed awkward, ill-timed or
half-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is not used to running negative campaigns and he is not
good at it,'' said Martha Darling, who worked for Bradley in the
Senate and served on his Michigan campaign. ``Bill had only run in
New Jersey. Al Gore started running in 1988. He's got a lot of pros
on his staff. Bill has a lot less seasoned staff. It shows that
there is a certain lack of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Bradley, Bradley's wife, said her husband simply
wasn't willing to sacrifice his principles for the sake of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the risk that Bill was willing to take,'' Bradley
said. ``Bill is who is, and so I don't think he could adjust to a
system that works like politics as usual. That's not Bill. He could
not reinvent himself as a politician as usual.''

COMMENTARY: A DELICATE BALANCE

 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton uses the term ``the trust
divide'' when she talks about the suspicion and hostility that have
created such a devastating gap between the law-abiding residents of
some big-city neighborhoods and the police officers who are
supposed to protect and serve them.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City at the moment, the situation is particularly
bleak. In the aftermath of the Louima and Diallo cases, there is
tremendous anxiety and frustration, even fear, in minority
neighborhoods like Soundview and Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant.
</P>
<P>
   Parents give their children lectures on how to respond if
approached by the police. Professional men talk about their
reluctance to carry a cell phone, lest it create a bulge that could
lead to a humiliating search, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Police-community relations are an unusual issue for a U.S.
Senate race. But unusual is the norm for this race between Rudolph
Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton, so get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee the other day, Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to add
her voice and influence to those who are attempting to bridge the
divide between the police officers, who have the difficult and
dangerous job of fighting crime, and the people in the
neighborhoods who feel they are treated unfairly and
disrespectfully.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said the Louima and Diallo cases were not just
``horrific'' but symptomatic of problems in the city's overall
approach to policing. The real challenge, she said, is to adjust
the approach _ ``change the climate'' _ so that policing ``is both
effective and respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton referred specifically to a recent article by Fox
Butterfield in The New York Times that detailed how some cities
have achieved reductions in crime comparable to New York's without
the same levels of police aggression and confrontation, and without
the same deterioration of relations between the police and local
communities.
</P>
<P>
   There was an effort by the police in those cities to work  &UR; with &LR; 
community leaders, local residents, the clergy and even youngsters,
enlisting their support and help in the fight against crime in
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   New York has scoffed at that approach.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said the crime-fighting strategies launched in the
1990s required a two-pronged effort. There had to be a serious
crackdown on crime and quality-of-life offenses that would, among
other things, send a message ``to criminals and victims alike that
we're changing the way we do business.'' But there was also a need
for the police to respectfully engage the law-abiding members of
the community, thus making them part of the overall anti-crime
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other cities have done a better job on that second
prong of the strategy,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   So what's next?
</P>
<P>
   There will be increased calls, especially from members of the
clergy, for a closer working relationship between local communities
and the New York Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton strongly supports that effort. As she said in an
appearance Sunday at Riverside Church, ``In so many communities, no
institution has more influence than the neighborhood church, mosque
or synagogue. We must tap into this potential in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   This would not be an effort in a vacuum. There already are some
good working relationships between the clergy and local precinct
commanders, but they are not the norm. Those relationships can be
built upon.
</P>
<P>
   It would be enormously helpful if Giuliani at some point would
see the light and lend his considerable weight to a real effort to
improve police-community relations. But the effort will happen
whether he chooses to participate or not.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two years ago, the Kerner commission on the riots of the
1960s found the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``The abrasive relationship between the police and the minority
communities has been a major _ and explosive _ source of grievance,
tension and disorder. The blame must be shared by the total
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police are faced with demands for increased protection and
service in the ghetto. Yet the aggressive patrol practices thought
necessary to meet these demands themselves create tension and
hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   That was March 1968. This is March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Now might be a good time to get started.

CARDINAL LAW TO DELIVER APOLOGY FOR CATHOLICS' SINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cardinal Bernard F. Law on Saturday will express sorrow
for contemporary and historical sins of Boston Catholics, including
church members' treatment of Jews, blacks, non-Catholic Christians,
and alienated Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Law's decision to seek forgiveness for sins of Boston's
Catholics is inspired by remarks Pope John Paul II is scheduled to
make on Sunday, in which the pope plans to seek forgiveness for
``faults of the past,'' including aspects of the Crusades, the
Inquisition, and perhaps the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will focus on those situations in our history as a church
which, from the perspective of today, we look upon with sorrow and
regret, as we also beg God to forgive us our own individual sins,''
said Law, who is the Catholic archbishop of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The pope and the cardinal are each expected to stick to broad
themes, rather than listing specific events, because, Cardinal
Roger Etchegaray, president of the Vatican's 2000 Jubilee
Committee, said this week, ``a penitential act, however public it
may be, must not appear as a form of spectacular
self-flagellation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the archdiocesan newspaper, the Pilot, has acknowledged that
Catholic priests and nuns owned slaves, and that the Pilot itself
maintained a racist editorial policy during the Civil War. The pope
has admitted fault for violence against church dissidents,
religious wars and excesses of evangelization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledgements of sin are prompted by the start of Lent, a
period in which Christians are supposed to seek penance for sins,
and by the ongoing Jubilee year, an anniversary during which the
church is pausing for reflection on its first 2,000 years. Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles issued his own apology to divorced
Catholics, women, gays, and victims of clergy sexual abuse in a
speech this week, and some other bishops are expected to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the themes of the Jubilee year for us is
reconciliation,'' Law said in an interview at the Cathedral of the
Holy Cross, where he will make his remarks in a homily during a
special vespers service of evening prayers at 7 p.m. Saturday. ``We
will be looking back to those moments when, through her members,
the church was not faithful to herself, to the message of Christ,
and it's a good thing for us. . .to name those things. It's a good
thing for us, and it's also a good thing to name those things for
others who share those memories with us and for whom they are
vivid.''
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated remarks by the cardinal and the pope are being
welcomed by representatives of groups who in the past have been
discriminated against or persecuted by Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud the pope for his courage in standing up and saying
we can no longer afford to ignore the abuses we have been
participating in, and I'm glad to see he is encouraging his
archbishops to do the same,'' said Charles Turner, a member of the
Boston City Council who has been active on civil rights issues, and
who said other institutions acknowledge their historic treatment of
African-Americans. ``It's a very important spiritual and social and
political act.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy K. Kaufman, executive director of the Jewish Community
Relations Council of Greater Boston, is also pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pope has probably gone further than any pope ever in
terms of seeking forgiveness for past Catholic errrors, including
the treatment of Jews, and it's wonderful,'' Kaufman said.
``Reconciliation and forgiveness is always important.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics wonder if the church is going far enough,
particularly because both the pope and the cardinal insist that
they are not apologizing for the church, but for its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no news that Catholics have committed sins, but the issue
is whether official representatives of the church, like popes and
bishops, have sinned in ways that implicate the institution,'' said
Lisa S. Cahill, a Boston College theologian. ``More and more
frequently the pope and other representatives have been offering
quasi-apologies to groups that have been harmed by practices of
those within the Catholic church, but they're very careful about
staying away from attributing guilt to the church as a whole, and
that's a point of contention.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the archdiocese of Boston say the church itself
does not sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church as an institution has been faithful to the Lord,
but members. . .have themselves been sinners, and even, at times,
in the name of the church people have done things that are wrong,''
said Bishop William Murphy, Law's top aide.
</P>
<P>
   At the service Saturday, Law plans to speak broadly about sins
of church members in his homily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously our relationship across religious divides has not
always been what it should have been, or across racial divides and
linguistic divides,'' he said. ``We have a very appropriate and
correct knowledge about the fundamental equality of men and women,
but that hasn't always been lived out as it should be, and I hope
to address that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then church officials will recite a list of approximately 12
categories of sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be expressing sorrow for sins of anti-semitism, for a
lack of openness and collaboration with other Christians, for
slavery, and for a lack of outreach to Catholics who for one reason
or another are alienated,'' said Murphy, who is helping to draft
the list.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily Sunday, the pope is expected to allude to the
Crusades, a series of military expeditions from the 11th through 13
centuries in which Christians violently attempted to wrest control
of Jerusalem from Muslims, and to the Inquisition, a medieval papal
institution in which the church used torture, among other methods,
to find and punish heretics.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope is also expected to allude to Nazi Germany's campaign
to eliminate European Jewry in the 1930s and '40s, which the
Vatican described this week as a result of ``pagan ideology,'' but
said ``it must be asked whether the Nazi persecution of the Jews
was not made easier by the anti-Jewish prejudices imbedded in some
Christian minds and hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said the failings of Catholics must be understood in
historical context, but that the context does not supply an excuse
for sinful behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as Catholics have to be sensitive to the fact that to the
degree that we're guilty of racism, we are letting ourselves be
formed by the dominant culture, rather than being prophetic in that
culture, which we are called to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he is concerned about contemporary failings of
Catholics, which he said include a failure to advocate strongly
enough for the poor in America and abroad and a failure to oppose
strongly enough abortion, capital punishment, and euthanasia.

CENSUS IS SUBJECT TO MORE PARTISAN DEBATE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla . )  By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After weeks marked by peace and cooperation, the
partisan wars over the conduct of the 2000 Census have erupted once
again.
</P>
<P>
   As the Census Bureau has begun mailing questionnaires to nearly
120 million households, Republicans in Congress are complaining
that the bureau is stonewalling their effort to oversee how the
census is carried out.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Census Bureau officials say they are being
nibbled to death by requests for information from Congress, the
General Accounting Office, a joint Presidential/Congressional
Monitoring Board, the National Academy of Science and other
entities keeping track of how well the bureau is doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that many oversight entities want to have ``real
time'' information on census operations, meaning they want
up-to-the-minute data such as recruitment of staff, number of
questionnaires that have been mailed or returned and number of
households visited.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Democrats have begun criticizing Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who,
after much prodding, has finally said that he opposes the use of
statistical sampling to supplement traditional methods of counting
residents.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their attacks, Democrats released copies of
memorandums written by Texas officials who, at one point in 1997
declared that ``all sides in the census debate concede that
traditional methods of calculation, which seek to identify and
count each individual resident, will never provide a full and
accurate portrait of the U.S. population.''
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the memorandums, Democrats hope to show that Bush
has adopted a partisan position regarding sampling that is actually
harmful to the interests of his own state.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the fireworks were centered in a hearing Wednesday
held by the House Subcommittee on the Census. The panel's chairman
grilled Kenneth W. Prewitt, the Census Bureau Director on his
agency's alleged unresponsiveness to requests by the GAO and other
bodies for information.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., who is chairman of the subcommittee was
particularly incensed over a recent memorandum written by top
officials of the Census Bureau to the heads of local and regional
offices. In the memorandum, census officials said any official
delegations wishing to visit a local or regional office must submit
a written request two weeks in advance. The document also declared
that visitors be accompanied by senior Census Bureau staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem,'' Miller said ``Are you denying there is a
problem? This is going to affect respect for the census when we go
through this process. Unless we can get this information,
everyone's going to be suspect of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt, retorted that top management of the census was already
spending up to one-third of its time responding to requests for
information for the subcommittee staff, the GAO and others.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up a copy of the District of Columbia yellow Pages,
Prewitt said that his agency had already turned over one terrabyte
of information to the GAO which he said was equivalent to 50
million copies of the yellow pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how much information we all already giving to GAO,''
Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats ascribe a more partisan motive for the
Republicans' request for more ``real time'' information.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the census boils down to whether the bureau can
use statistical sampling to augment population counts that will be
used to draw Congressional boundaries, a process known as
redistricting. Sampling, which is an enhanced and more
sophisticated version of polling, is presumed to help Democrats in
redistricting since it will boost the number of minorities _ mainly
blacks in the inner cities and Hispanics in rural areas _ who tend
to be missed by tradition census methods.
</P>
<P>
   Population counts for use in redistricting must be delivered to
the states by April 1, 2001. In order to provide those counts using
sampling the Census Bureau must have finished employing its
traditional counting methods and started its sampling work by
mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fear that Republicans are trying to delay the Census
Bureau enough that it will be forced to not use sampling techniques
in order to make the April 1, 2001 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican staffer who is very familiar with the party's
strategy gave some credence to that view saying that House
Republicans want the real time information on census operations to
make sure that the Census Bureau does not start its sampling work
too soon.

HEARING OPENS ON PLANS TO FUND COLOMBIA   DRUG FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The war on drugs may approach a moment of truth
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is set to happen in room 2359 at the Rayburn Building, when
House Appropriations Committee Chair C.W. Bill Young of Florida
opens a hearing on an emergency spending bill for fighting drugs in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   First, the committee will hear about the Republican leadership's
new $2 billion plan attacking drug cultivation and trafficking in
Colombia and the Andean ridge, an increase of $428 million over the
Clinton administration's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, members will offer amendments, the most substantial one
expected from California Representative Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat,
who wants to add up to $1.3 billion for treatment of drug addicts
in America.
</P>
<P>
   If she offers the amendment as planned, it would mark a rare
occasion in the drug war when decision makers look at both grower
and user, and then make a judgment on how best to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the focus on drugs is almost always on fighting
the problem far from home; only 18 percent, or $3.8 billion, of the
national drug budget is spent on treatment.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many here, members of Congress have
challenged the Colombian plan on a number of flanks. Still,
congressional staff believe that a Republican-White House tandem
has enough votes to pass the $2 billion plan.
</P>
<P>
   A Pelosi amendment, the staff members say, would have a slim
chance of passage, although the issue of more money for treatment
is expected again in Senate debate.
</P>
<P>
   While several staff members said Pelosi is set to offer a $1.3
billion admendment, a Pelosi spokesman said a decision would be
made this morning. He said Democratic leaders could even scuttle
all amendments and challenge the legislation later.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the divisiveness in the congressional debate, the
Republican leaders _ namely House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, Sonny Callahan of Alabama
and John L. Mica of Florida _ decided against wholesale changes in
the Clinton plan in hopes of holding together their coalition. With
White House acquiesance, their changes included: --Taking two of
the 30 Sikorsky UH-60L Blackhawk helicopters earmarked for the
military and giving them to the Colombian police, long favorites of
Hastert and Gilman.
</P>
<P>
   --Expanding regional funds to $137 million from $76 million, the
bulk of it for Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   --Adding $282.5 million for the Drug Enforcement Agency for
increased electronic surveillance domestically and internationally,
and $116 million for upgrading and building airfields in Ecuador,
Aruba and Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the White House's original plan _ $1.27 billion
in new funding and $330 million in existing requests _ was
criticized by human rights groups for relying heavily on Colombia's
military, which has ties with outlaw paramilitary groups. A Human
Rights Watch report found that nearly half of Colombia's military
units were linked to paramilitaries, known to commit some of the
worst abuses in Colombia's long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The US-financed attack stays clear of the areas controled by
paramilitary forces in central and northern Colombia. The leader of
the paramilitaries acknowledged last week in a television interview
that the drug trade provided 70 percent of the group's funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paramilitaries are up to their eyeballs in drug
trafficking and yet this package doesn't address that,'' said
Representative Jim McGovern, a Worcester Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's strategy is to provide air transportation
for three US-trained military brigades to the largely
guerrilla-controled Putumayo and Caqueta regions, home to 64
percent of the country's coca crop, according to US estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Even the choice of helicopters has stirred debate, with some
human rights groups questioning the quiet role of two Connecticut
progressives, Senator Christopher J. Dodd and Representative Sam
Gejdenson. Both lawmkers have been traditionally outspoken on human
rights issues, especially in Latin America, but they have said
little about the Colombian bill.
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights advocates wonder if that has something to do
with a potential $400 million contract for the Connecticut-based
United Technologies Corp., which makes the Blackhawk helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd and Gejdenson said that's nonsense, adding they haven't
decided whether to support the bill. ``If there's a need for
helicopters, they ought to have the best, and the general consensus
is that the helicopters made in Connecticut are the best for the
job,'' said Gejdenson.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``We need to expand the discussion on drugs. We
need to do a lot more work on demand reduction, and one of my
concerns with this package is that there is a danger we simply move
the cultivation to another country. That doesn't achieve your goal.
Demand reduction might do more.''

BALL BOUNCES HUSKIES' WAY _ AGAIN _ AGAINST EAGLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's tough to play hard and play well for 40 minutes
when you know you are supposed to lose _ when you know the other
guys are bettter.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College-University of Connecticut basketball series
is a one-sided rivalry that is now reaching biblical dimension. It
makes Gore-Bradley look like a pick 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dukakis was a presidential candidate and Bruce Hurst a
Red Sox pitcher the last time Boston College beat UConn in
basketball (1988). Wednesday, in the hallowed hardwood house where
Bill Bradley was a winner, the Huskies kept the streak (23 and
counting) going with a 70-55 victory in the first round of the Big
East tourney.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the Hukies think of the Eagles: When star guard
Khalid El-Amin was interviewed by Dan Patrick in ESPN Magazine,
Patrick asked if the Houston Comets of the WNBA would beat any team
in the Big East. El-Amin said, ``They'd give BC a run.'' When
Patrick noted that BC folk might be riled by the comment, El-Amin
said, ``Just being honest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we saw that,'' said BC senior captain Michael Cotton.
``Everyone's entitled to their opinion. Obviously, we are
outmatched by them. They are bigger, stronger, taller. But the
other stuff is just talk. We can compete with them, but it's tough
over 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early going Wednesday, the Eagles dared to dream. Al
Skinner's motley crew, playing without flossy freshman Troy Bell
(knee), BC bolted to a 12-3 lead over the defending national
champs.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmm. Upset in the making? . . . Jesuit school performs a
miracle on 34th Street on Ash Wednesday . . . The most astounding
college hoop upset since Chaminade over Ralph Sampson's Virginia
powerhouse in the 1983.
</P>
<P>
   No. Huskie coach Jim Calhoun called timeout, spanked his cocky
lads, and UConn had the game tied at 14 three minutes later. Then
El-Amin hit a short baseline jumper and UConn never trailed again.
The peak lead was 68-48 and the Huskies outrebounded BC, 46-26.
</P>
<P>
   ``UConn is a much more gifted basketball team than we are,''
admiited Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle senior guard Dwayne Pina said, ``Maybe their lack of
respect allowed us to jump out early. We saw what (El-Amin) said. I
guess we used that as motivation. We wanted to prove them wrong.
Next year hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Next season will be Skinner's fourth and the Eagles are going to
have to improve if they want to come back to this tournament. In
2001, the league tournament will cease to be all-inclusive and that
means another Eagle appearance in the basement will keep BC home.
</P>
<P>
   There is officially no one left (except student managers) from
the Jim O'Brien era. The Eagles have turned in seasons of 15-16,
6-21, and 11-19 in Skinner's three years on the job. Boston College
is the consensus worst team in the conference and it no longer
serves any useful purpose to think of the Final Four possibilities
if O'Brien had been allowed to keep the players he recruited. In a
town dominated by professional sports (and the accompanying
negativity cited by Skinner's old UMass backcourtmate, Rick Pitino)
Boston College basketball has become irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner doesn't mind the apathy, just Red Sox players never
minded playing in the background during April, May, and June back
in the days when the Celtics were good. Hiding in the weeds can
have its advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate people coming out and supporting us, but that's
not the reason I do this,'' said the coach. ``But this has been a
tough year, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's not worried about the UConn streak _ one that dates
back to the days when Dana Barros was throwing up threes against
the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it's real important,'' said the coach.
``These players have not experienced that. I don't have a problem
with the streak that exists. It's no reflection on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Michael Cotton has played his last game for the Eagles,
and like Billy Curley, Howard Eisley, Malcom Huckaby, Danya Abrams,
Mickey Curley, Bevan Thomas, and Antonio Granger before him, he
leaves the Heights without ever knowing what it feels like to beat
Connecticut.

   SEDONA, Ariz. _ The winner was out and about Wednesday. The
loser was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after he scored decisive victories, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas sounded the first notes in his fight for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican John McCain, who won just four of the 13 Republican
contests Tuesday, flew from Los Angeles to his cabin near Sedona
with the media in tow.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is weighing what to do now that the Republican nomination
all but belongs to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries and caucuses Tuesday lived up to their billing as
the make-or-break round of voting, and Wednesday brought a clear
change in focus.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was in Austin, where he voted for himself in next week's
Texas presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting McCain's decision, Bush is expected to campaign today
in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, which hold primaries Friday. Texas,
Florida and four other states vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Having put down McCain's stubborn challenge with the help of
conservative Republicans, Bush turned his attention to the
formidable task of winning support from centrist voters who have so
far shunned him for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He praised McCain, abandoning the vitriol that has marked their
increasingly contentious race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the campaign allowed him to show Americans that he
could ``come through a tough primary intact.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men spoke Tuesday night, a conversation Bush described
as ``good,'' but that McCain political director John Weaver called
``quick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will resolve any differences we have at a later date,''
Bush said. ``I'm confident we will be able to do so. He waged a
good campaign. He's a tough competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain touched a nerve, and that is people are sick
and tired of what's going on in Washington,'' Bush said. ``I also
touched that same nerve. That's why our party is energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is now going after Vice President Al Gore, who has said
keeping a Democrat in office is the best way to keep the economy
humming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to respond by saying if people are happy with the
status quo in Washington, then vote for Al Gore,'' said Bush. ``If
people are happy with Al Gore and Bill Clinton, the tone they've
set for America, then you've got a perfect person to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Bush's running mate also intensified
Wednesday, despite the governor's protests that such talk is
premature.
</P>
<P>
   Several names made the rounds Wednesday on an informal e-mail
network of Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   Included were Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts
of Oklahoma, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, New York Gov.
George Pataki, former GOP presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole,
U.S. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Gen. Colin Powell and Sen.
Connie Mack of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he would not accept the No. 2 spot ``under any
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said Wednesday the candidate
has made no decisions about what he will do, but that he will
figure out a way to keep his reform message alive. ``There are
1,000 permutations and combinations,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities include a continuation of the campaign against
Bush, although Bush is rapidly closing in on the 1,034 delegates he
needs for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the table is a third-party candidacy. McCain has all but
ruled out leaving the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But he did receive a quarter of the vote in a three-way race
against Bush and Gore, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore each had a third of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't conceive of John jumping to the Reform Party, but I
can certainly see him being pushed into it,'' Weaver said
elliptically.

HEARING OPENS ON PLANS TO FUND COLOMBIA   DRUG FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The war on drugs may approach a moment of truth
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is set to happen in room 2359 at the Rayburn Building, when
House Appropriations Committee Chair C.W. Bill Young of Florida
opens a hearing on an emergency spending bill for fighting drugs in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   First, the committee will hear about the Republican leadership's
new $2 billion plan attacking drug cultivation and trafficking in
Colombia and the Andean ridge, an increase of $428 million over the
Clinton administration's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, members will offer amendments, the most substantial one
expected from California Representative Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat,
who wants to add up to $1.3 billion for treatment of drug addicts
in America.
</P>
<P>
   If she offers the amendment as planned, it would mark a rare
occasion in the drug war when decision makers look at both grower
and user, and then make a judgment on how best to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the focus on drugs is almost always on fighting
the problem far from home; only 18 percent, or $3.8 billion, of the
national drug budget is spent on treatment.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many here, members of Congress have
challenged the Colombian plan on a number of flanks. Still,
congressional staff believe that a Republican-White House tandem
has enough votes to pass the $2 billion plan.
</P>
<P>
   A Pelosi amendment, the staff members say, would have a slim
chance of passage, although the issue of more money for treatment
is expected again in Senate debate.
</P>
<P>
   While several staff members said Pelosi is set to offer a $1.3
billion admendment, a Pelosi spokesman said a decision would be
made this morning. He said Democratic leaders could even scuttle
all amendments and challenge the legislation later.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the divisiveness in the congressional debate, the
Republican leaders _ namely House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, Sonny Callahan of Alabama
and John L. Mica of Florida _ decided against wholesale changes in
the Clinton plan in hopes of holding together their coalition. With
White House acquiesance, their changes included: --Taking two of
the 30 Sikorsky UH-60L Blackhawk helicopters earmarked for the
military and giving them to the Colombian police, long favorites of
Hastert and Gilman.
</P>
<P>
   --Expanding regional funds to $137 million from $76 million, the
bulk of it for Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   --Adding $282.5 million for the Drug Enforcement Agency for
increased electronic surveillance domestically and internationally,
and $116 million for upgrading and building airfields in Ecuador,
Aruba and Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the White House's original plan _ $1.27 billion
in new funding and $330 million in existing requests _ was
criticized by human rights groups for relying heavily on Colombia's
military, which has ties with outlaw paramilitary groups. A Human
Rights Watch report found that nearly half of Colombia's military
units were linked to paramilitaries, known to commit some of the
worst abuses in Colombia's long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The US-financed attack stays clear of the areas controled by
paramilitary forces in central and northern Colombia. The leader of
the paramilitaries acknowledged last week in a television interview
that the drug trade provided 70 percent of the group's funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paramilitaries are up to their eyeballs in drug
trafficking and yet this package doesn't address that,'' said
Representative Jim McGovern, a Worcester Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's strategy is to provide air transportation
for three US-trained military brigades to the largely
guerrilla-controled Putumayo and Caqueta regions, home to 64
percent of the country's coca crop, according to US estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Even the choice of helicopters has stirred debate, with some
human rights groups questioning the quiet role of two Connecticut
progressives, Senator Christopher J. Dodd and Representative Sam
Gejdenson. Both lawmkers have been traditionally outspoken on human
rights issues, especially in Latin America, but they have said
little about the Colombian bill.
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights advocates wonder if that has something to do
with a potential $400 million contract for the Connecticut-based
United Technologies Corp., which makes the Blackhawk helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd and Gejdenson said that's nonsense, adding they haven't
decided whether to support the bill. ``If there's a need for
helicopters, they ought to have the best, and the general consensus
is that the helicopters made in Connecticut are the best for the
job,'' said Gejdenson.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``We need to expand the discussion on drugs. We
need to do a lot more work on demand reduction, and one of my
concerns with this package is that there is a danger we simply move
the cultivation to another country. That doesn't achieve your goal.
Demand reduction might do more.''

BARAK AND ARAFAT AGREE TO NEW TALKS, AT A LOW LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian and Israeli leaders agreed Wednesday to
resume their fitful peace talks this month in Washington, holding
to their self-imposed deadline of Sept. 13 for a final treaty
despite a long history of stop-and-go negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after the second of two meetings between
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat, in the space of a day. The final session took place in a
hotel in the Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah, which has
become the hub for Palestinian Authority ministries in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The previous face-to-face encounter between the two leaders took
place more than one month ago at the edge of the Gaza Strip and
ended acrimoniously. A few days after that summit, Palestinian
negotiators suspended the peace talks, expressing frustration with
both the scope and timetable of Israel's proposed withdrawal from
more of the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians complained that Israel had tried to dictate, rather
than discuss, the choice of territory that was supposed to be
handed over to full or partial Palestinian control earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton decided that a low-key approach, with low
expectations, was the best way to resume the talks, according to an
administration spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, James Rubin, the spokesman, said that
``this is the best way to give a kick-start to the process.'' He
added that ``even a good kick-start might not get it going.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which officials said are begin on March 18 in the
Washington area, will involve small teams of negotiators who are
charged with designing a blueprint for a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we needed more preparation at lower levels before
before getting the leaders together,'' said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   No details were released Wednesday about any Israeli concessions
made to induce the Palestinians back to the bargaining table, but
some officials from both camps said the Palestinians would be given
more say in determining which areas are transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ross, President Clinton's peace envoy, played master of
ceremonies Wednesday. He called the leaders' private discussions
``very constructive'' and said that Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators would restart their work on a framework agreement for
peace after the Muslim holiday of Eid al Adha, which ends on March
16.
</P>
<P>
   During the monthlong hiatus in talks, both Egypt and the United
States made intensive diplomatic efforts to bring the sides
together. To underline the Egyptian role, Barak and Arafat are
scheduled to meet the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, in the
Sinai resort town of Sharm el Sheik on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Only after that meeting, officials said, could any details be
disclosed of the working understandings between Palestinians and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Body language, metaphors and gestures are all part of the
elaborate rituals of making peace in the Middle East, and on
Wednesday all three were put to use in the Barak-Arafat meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The location of the meeting, in Ramallah, was widely interpreted
as a concession to Arafat. It was only the second time, as far as
is known, that the Israeli leader ventured into a
Palestinian-controlled area for one of their regular summits.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring the negotiations for at least the first week or so
to Washington was also seen as a gesture to the Palestinians, who
have complained that Israel effectively downgraded the importance
of their track while pursuing more high-profile peace talks with
Syria in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's ambitious attempt to make peace on parallel tracks with
the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon, also has drawn criticism in
Israel as unrealistic and risky.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the effort has faltered. The Syrian talks have been
suspended since mid-January. Soon after they broke down, the
Syrian-backed Hezbollah militia stepped up attacks on Israeli
soldiers in southern Lebanon, bringing fierce Israeli reprisals
that served to unite normally squabbling Arab leaders behind both
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Israeli Cabinet voted to force Syria's
hand by pledging to unilaterally withdraw from southern Lebanon if
no peace agreement is reached by July. That pledge has unsettled
Syrian and Lebanese leaders, who have called it a devious attempt
to pressure them, but there has been no word yet on a resumption of
the Syria-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians and Israelis, whose negotiations were suspended
after the Syrian talks broke down, have been negotiating on and off
for nearly seven years. One of the main sticking points has been
the transfer of land in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the
Palestinians, as set out in an interim agreement seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The next transfer was supposed to put another 6.1 percent of the
territory in the hands of the Palestinian Authority. If it happens,
Palestinians would control, either completely or in conjunction
with Israel, about 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than desert and thinly populated areas, as Israel had
proposed in the last round of talks, Arafat has demanded that the
next handover include land close to the disputed city of Jerusalem,
including the small Arab suburb of Abu Dis on a hillside
overlooking the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Jerusalem _ which Israel claims as its
nondivisible capital _ is supposed to be negotiated as part of the
final peace deal, but the shadow of that emotional issue hangs over
much of the calculations in the short-term.
</P>
<P>
   The land question will likely rear up again once the two sides
return to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and Israeli officials have suggested that Israel
would offer 10 percent of the West Bank land, out of which Arafat
could choose the 6.1 percent that he wants.
</P>
<P>
   But it may still not be the populated areas near Jerusalem that
the Palestinians seek.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy said Israel had not committed to
turn over territory closer to Arab urban centers as an incentive to
bring the Palestinians back to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such promise,'' he told Israel Radio. ``Naturally,
they have their wishes about a number of revisions. The prime
minister heard them and is to formulate a proposal that he will
present it to the Cabinet.'' Arafat has demanded as well that
Israel transfer more land in advance of a final settlement, as
called for in the Oslo accord, but Barak, like his predecessor,
Benjamin Netanyahu, balked at giving up more land outside of the
terms of a final treaty.

But, as became increasingly clear in the closing stages of John
McCain's presidential campaign, this script did not have a happy

Bush, he stumbled particularly badly in the state in which he had
hoped for his greatest popular triumph, California. &QL;

Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, seems to be slipping a bit
more each day. Amidst all this, fears abound in Israel over what

   by Molly Ivins with Lou Dubose &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Political biography &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $19.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Texas Gov. George W. Bush has discovered, the world loves to
skewer front-runners _ at the polls, in conversation and, most
assuredly, in print.
</P>
<P>
   We have already seen some books supposedly providing the
definitive literary look at Bush. Bill Minutaglio's ``First Son''
was reasonably objective; ``Fortunate Son's'' author, J.H.
Hatfield, who turned out to be an ex-con, floated ``deep source''
rumors about a Bush drug arrest that, upon investigation, didn't
seem to hold up. (Publisher St. Martin's press pulled ``Fortunate
Son'' from bookstore shelves.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush even weighed in with his own book: ``A Charge to Keep,''
which was ghost-written by a Bush staff member and naturally put
its subject in the best possible light.
</P>
<P>
   ``W'' and ``Shrub'' are, in their respective ways, extensions of
what has been offered before, except for the governor's own
version. Elizabeth Mitchell, former executive editor of ``George''
magazine, and Molly Ivins, superstar columnist of the
``Star-Telegram,'' examine the Republican presidential candidate
and find him wanting. They agree that Bush is a reasonably nice
fellow, but lacking intellectual depth and real moral commitment to
anyone other than the economic elite. They examine his oil business
and major-league baseball deals, determining that he gained maximum
financial advantage with minimal financial risk in both. It's fair
to say Bush supporters will not be pleased with either book.
</P>
<P>
   But ``W'' and ``Shrub'' have entirely different tones; it is
obvious that, except for ghostwritten autobiographies, books
published about presidential candidates in midcampaign are likely
to be critical. Criticism, or the hint of scandal, sells so much
better than praise.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``W'' comes across more as medium-researched magazine
fodder than extensive dirt-digging. Mitchell's magazine background
_ she's worked for ``SPIN,'' ``Glamour'' and ``Conde Nast
Traveler'' as well as ``George'' _ is evident in every skimpy
paragraph. In 334 pages, she attempts to chronicle the entire Bush
family history, starting when George kissed Barbara on the cheek
after escorting her to the prom at Andover. To cram everything in,
she can't use up too many words in analysis. More pages are
dedicated to Bush's successful race against Ann Richards than are
devoted to his performance as governor. When Mitchell quotes former
Bob Dole campaign worker Scott Reed as saying ``Half the people who
are for (Bush) can't tell you exactly why,'' that's as close as she
gets to in-depth opinionizing.
</P>
<P>
   Ivins, on the other hand, doesn't pretend to be objective about
the governor. In the introduction to ``Shrub,'' Ivins and co-author
Lou Dubose (editor of the ``Texas Observer'') cattily note ``if, at
the end of this short book, you find W. Bush's political resume a
little light, don't blame us. There's really not much there. We
have been looking for six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, for 179 pages, the Ivins/Dubose team takes every shot
possible: at Bush as a student, businessman, and politician. At
book's end, the authors conclude that Bush's ``reform'' policy
``means the end of democracy and a direct leap into oligopoly, rule
by the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrub'' comes off as an extended Molly Ivins column, which
ought to make it easy to decide whether you want to read it. Unlike
Mitchell and just about every other author of campaign-driven
political biographies, Ivins isn't trying to fool you about how she
feels; she's openly attempting to woo you to the anti-Bush side.
There's something to be said for that kind of honesty. Even Bush
supporters will have to admit that she and Dubose aren't being
sneaky. And they attempt to back up their one-liners with facts and
figures, though Bushites will argue that numbers can be twisted to
support flawed opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``W'' offers the only positive glimpses of Bush; Mitchell
includes a few touching lines about how, when one of Bush's West
Texas oil companies, Spectrum 7, was being acquired by a larger
outfit, Bush got on the phone and stayed there until he found jobs
for all his employees who otherwise would have been unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither ``W'' nor ``Shrub'' will make any Bush supporters or
detractors switch camps. The latter title is more entertaining
reading than the former. Mitchell's approach is less extreme than
the Ivins/Dubose team's. We can be certain Bush won't read either
one of them.

 &HT;    A fond farewell for Georgia Tech's Bobby Cremins
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As his visitor arrives, Bobby Cremins is furiously writing note
cards, trying to respond to a stack of letters about three inches
thick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's only two days' worth,'' Cremins said, pointing to the
letters. ``It's been incredible. If I didn't have all those
skeletons in my closet, I could run for public office.''
</P>
<P>
   The mail, most of it gushing with affection and appreciation,
represents just one of the tributes that have poured in since
Cremins announced that he was stepping down as Georgia Tech's
basketball coach after 19 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After making his decision, Cremins hoped to quietly coach his
final games and slip off to the golf course and the beach with his
wife, Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance. Cremins' friends in college basketball want his
final days as an ACC coach to be memorable.
</P>
<P>
   After making his announcement on Feb. 18, Cremins spent the rest
of the day and night on the telephone with friends. At 11 p.m.,
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to watch our game tomorrow,'' Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike, don't say anything or do anything special,'' Cremins
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just watch the game,'' Krzyzewski said, and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when Krzyzewski walked onto the court at N.C.
State, he had abandoned his usual game attire for Cremins'
trademark blue shirt and yellow tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really touched me,'' Cremins said.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest coach Dave Odom honored Cremins and his wife before
the Tech-Wake game on Feb. 27. Two Wake Forest fans approached
Carolyn Cremins to say how much they will miss her and Bobby and to
thank them for how much they had done for the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, at North Carolina, Cremins asked Bill
Guthridge not to do anything special before the game. So, Guthridge
and former coach Dean Smith showed up at Tech's shoot-around that
morning and presented Cremins with a new putter.
</P>
<P>
   His former players have been calling. Dennis Scott, Kenny
Anderson and Brian Oliver, who led the Yellow Jackets to the Final
Four in 1990, were among the first. Oliver called from Italy. James
Forrest called from Greece. Karl Brown called from England. Matt
Harpring checks in from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been shocked at the response,'' Carolyn said. ``I knew
people liked and respected Bobby, but I figured we would just get a
couple of letters from some close friends. Neither of us ever
imagined anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, it's been kind of embarrassing,'' Bobby
Cremins said. ``I don't think too many losing coaches go out like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the point, his friends say. During 19 years in the
close-knit ACC, Cremins touched too many lives in a positive
fashion ever to be considered a losing coach _ no matter what the
recent record says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby will always be one of my favorites,'' former ACC
Commissioner Gene Corrigan said. ``The guy is genuine and likable.
I've never met another coach who didn't like Bobby. In a profession
like this, there are not many guys you can say that about.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tribute awaits Cremins when Georgia Tech faces Florida
State tonight in the first round of the ACC Tournament at the
Charlotte Coliseum. He remembers the warm ovation the Charlotte
fans gave Harpring in his final game in 1997, but isn't certain
what to expect tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Tech wins the tournament, Cremins' last game as an ACC
coach will be in Charlotte. It was also the site of his last game
as a college player.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, in the old Charlotte Coliseum on Independence
Boulevard, Cremins experienced his lowest moment as a player. Frank
McGuire's South Carolina team was good enough to contend for the
national championship, but in those days only the ACC Tournament
winner got a bid to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina was upset in the ACC finals by N.C. State,
suddenly ending Cremins' college career. Thirty years later, his
coaching career, at least for now, probably will end in the same
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty incredible, everything that has happened since then,''
Cremins said.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: The beach
</P>
<P>
   Cremins has made no immediate plans for his life after
basketball, other than heading for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get a beach chair, a double vodka tonic and watch
the NCAA Tournament,'' said Cremins, who hasn't ruled out a return
to coaching but says he's open to anything.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have urged him to take at least a year off, and Cremins
is inclined to do so. He remembers attending a luncheon with
then-Georgia coach Ron Jirsa, who was under fire in Athens. Cremins
was 51. Jirsa was in his late 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked horrible, and in comes Ron and he looked worse,''
Cremins said. ``Both of us were in bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Georgia State coach Lefty Driesell entered the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lefty comes be-bopping in there. He's in his 60s, and he looks
better than both of us put together,'' Cremins said. ``He told me
that taking a year off was the best thing that ever happen to him.
So maybe that's what I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins' $1.5 million settlement from Georgia Tech will allow
him that freedom. But close friends say that taking time off could
be tough for Cremins. This was his 25th consecutive year of
coaching, follwing 15 years as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon, it's going to hit Bobby that it's over,'' said
Kevin Cantwell, Cremins' assistant at Tech for the past 14 years
and at Appalachian State for six years before that. ``He's doing OK
now, but it's not going to be easy. The guy's life has been
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball has been my passion for so long, since I was like
12 years old,'' Cremins said. ``Can I replace it with something
else? That's what I've got to find out. I still think there is
something else out there for me. Maybe I can use this time to
figure out what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins says he is ``at peace'' with his decision but won't
totally relax until Georgia Tech gets another coach and his
assistants find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When those two things happen, I'm going to have as much fun as
I can,'' he said. ``But I think I need a break. I know I have to
get off the merry-go-round for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Cremins has suggested broadcasting as her husband's next
endeavor. Some people think that his unusual style and wit could
make Cremins the next Al McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember two years ago we were in New York for a game
against St. John's,'' she said. ``Bobby had a bunch of friends up,
and we were all going to go out to dinner after the game. But then
we lost, and Bobby didn't want to do anything. I told him if he was
in broadcasting, he could enjoy basketball, and it wouldn't matter
who wins or loses. What a nice life that would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins said he has not decided if he and his wife will continue
to live in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stay in Atlanta at least six months or a year, but after
that I don't know,'' he said. ``We love Atlanta, but I wonder if we
should just get away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby doesn't want to be perceived as hanging around and
getting in the way of the new coach (at Georgia Tech),'' Carolyn
said. ``I love living in Atlanta and would like to stay. We'll take
some time and see how things work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Dream
</P>
<P>
   Cremins has done a lot of thinking since Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   He has thought about the players whose lives he has touched in
19 season at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   He has thought about the friends he's made in coaching, and how
those friends have supported him.
</P>
<P>
   He has thought about winning his first ACC Tournament in 1985,
and how he knew then that he had arrived as a coach. From then on,
Dean Smith and the rest of the ACC would have to take seriously the
funny-talking guy with the prematurely silver hair.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Cremins has thought about his parents. Robert and
Margaret Cremins came to America from Ireland as teenagers. They
met in New York, returned to Ireland, got married and then came
back to the States. They wanted their children to be Americans.
Robert Joseph Cremins Jr. was born on the Fourth of July, 1947. You
can't get much more American than that.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been gone for a while. He wishes they could be in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents spent their whole lives drilling two things into
me,'' he said. ``That was the Catholic religion and the American
Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins' parents would point to the picture of John F. Kennedy
that hung prominently in their Bronx home and talk more about the
American Dream. If that young Catholic boy can become president,
they told Bobby, you can do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young I never understood what they meant about the
American Dream,'' Cremins said. ``Now I do. Thanks to basketball,
I've lived the American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Cremins dropped out of college and became a
bellhop at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. At the urging of his father,
Cremins went back to school, got two degrees and embarked on an
extraodinary career.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the 52-year-old Cremins prepares to walk away from
basketball, the central focus of his life for 40 years, he is
financially secure and universally liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years from now, it won't matter how many games he won,''
Carolyn Cremins said. ``What will matter is how many people loved
him and cared about him. In that respect, I'd say he's a pretty
lucky guy.''

ISRAELI HIGH COURT RULES ARAB COUPLE CAN LIVE IN JEWISH AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs for story slugged ISRAEL-MIXED-COUPLES on NY-BUDGET.)

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that an
Israeli Arab couple could not be barred from living in a community
built solely for Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark decision after more than four years of hearings was
hailed as an important step toward equality for Israel's 1 million
Arab citizens. It overturned longstanding policies intended to
promote exclusively Jewish settlements in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important ruling in the history of the
Supreme Court on the issue of equal rights for Arab citizens of
Israel, and it is a big step forward in the struggle for full
equality,'' said Dan Yakir, one of two lawyers from the Association
for Civil Rights in Israel who argued the case.
</P>
<P>
   Brought by an Israeli Arab couple who had been refused
permission to buy a plot or home in a Jewish cooperative settlement
in northern Israel, the case raised basic questions about whether
Israel could be both a Jewish and a democratic state, ideals
enshrined in its declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not accept the conception that the values of the State
of Israel as a Jewish state justify discrimination by the state
between citizens on the basis of religion or nationality,'' wrote
Judge Aharon Barak, the chief justice, in a ruling endorsed by
three of his colleagues on the five-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is not allowed to discriminate directly on the basis
of religion or nationality in allocation of state lands,'' Barak
added. ``Neither may the state discriminate indirectly'' in such
allocations.
</P>
<P>
   The case was brought by Adel and Iman Kaadan, an Israeli Arab
couple living in the town of Baqa al-Gharbiya, who had been barred
from joining Katzir, a cooperative Jewish settlement nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The bylaws of the settlement effectively bar membership by
Arabs, and the land in Katzir, developed by the quasi-governmental
Jewish Agency _ founded before Israel was established to promote
Jewish immigration and settlement in British-ruled Palestine _ was
allocated for use by Jews only.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state was not allowed by law to allocate state land to the
Jewish Agency to establish the settlement of Katzir on the basis of
discrimination between Jews and non-Jews,'' Judge Barak wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaadans, who have three children, said they wanted to move
to Katzir to escape the sewage in the streets and the overcrowded
schools of their town, which suffers from the neglect typical of
many Israeli Arab communities long lacking adequate budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers in Katzir raised objections, arguing that the Kaadans
would not blend into the social fabric of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a social fit,'' Dubi Sandrov, chairman of the
local council, asserted after Wednesday's ruling. ``There has to be
a binding glue in the first stages of the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Agency argued that its mission remained to settle
Jews across the country, especially in areas where the Jewish
population is sparse. In a brief to the court, it called Katzir ``a
link in a chain of outposts intended to safeguard the expanses of
Israel for the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Salai Meridor, the agency chairman, said after reading the court
decision that Katzir is in a part of Israel near the West Bank that
is heavily populated by Arabs, and that a Jewish presence there was
necessary to prevent an erosion of Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue is not equality,'' Meridor said. ``We're all
for equality. The question is how we ensure equality while also
making sure that areas with a massive Arab majority near the
territory of an emerging Palestinian entity will remain part of the
State of Israel. Along with equality, Israel must safeguard its
national and security interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Barakeh, an Israeli Arab legislator who has submitted a
bill to dismantle the Jewish Agency and the Jewish National Fund,
which also promotes land acquisition and settlement by Jews, said
the ruling had far-reaching implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unprecedented decision that undermines the basis of
the Jewish Agency as a body built on discrimination,'' he said.
``State land cannot be allocated to any body for purposes of
apartheid and racism. This moves Israel toward being a democratic
state for all its citizens, and not an ethnic democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling was read, the Kaadans embraced their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know today that this is a state of all its citizens,'' said
Mr. Kaadan, 44, a nurse. ``The meaning of this is enough
discrimination, enough racism _ give coexistence a chance.''

INDIA IRRITATED BY CLINTON'S DECISION TO VISIT PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Indian officials reacted Wednesday with
understated disgruntlement to President Clinton's decision to call
briefly on their adversary, Pakistan, after a five-day tour of
India this month. Pakistani officials were happy and relieved.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation, India's prime minister, Atal Behari
Vajpayee, warned Clinton on Tuesday night that Pakistan's military
rulers would use his decision to claim legitimacy for last year's
coup _ and that is what happened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the army chief who has ruled Pakistan
since the Oct. 12 coup, told a Reuters reporter in Islamabad that
Clinton's decision ``vindicates the legitimacy of my government's
stand and gives credence to our aim to put things right in our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision came after weeks of infighting in his
administration. White House officials said the purpose of the trip
was not to sanction the coup, but to deliver a message to the
military rulers that they should restore democracy, ratchet down
the tensions with India and ban an Islamic fundamentalist group
that the United States has accused of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   While Vajpayee was not surprised by the decision, which had been
expected, and though he is aware that India will still be the main
event on Clinton's South Asia trip, he was nonetheless displeased.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have campaigned to isolate Pakistan since an Indian
Airlines commercial flight was hijacked Dec. 24 with what India
maintained was Pakistani military sponsorship. Indian diplomats
have been pressing the United States to declare Pakistan a sponsor
of terrorism and lobbying the president to bypass Pakistan on his
trip.
</P>
<P>
   When the president finally made his decision Tuesday, he called
Vajpayee to break the news before announcing it publicly. H.K. Dua,
a spokesman for the prime minister, said Vajpayee told the
president that his visit to Pakistan ``would give the military
regime a signal of support.'' Still, Vajpayee assured Clinton that
he would be warmly welcomed here.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Pakistan, which is smaller and economically weaker
than India, sought to put a bright face on the president's decision
to stop for a few hours in Islamabad. They said they believed that
Clinton would use his influence to help them resolve their
half-century-old dispute with India over the territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good feeling that President Clinton will urge India
to also take the path of negotiations and a peaceful resolution to
the Kashmir dispute,'' Tariq Altaf, a spokesman for the Pakistani
Foreign Office, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton has repeatedly stated that the United States will
not mediate the Kashmir conflict until India welcomes its
intervention _ something India has adamantly refused to do _ he has
also repeatedly said that South Asia is one of the most dangerous
places on earth because of India and Pakistan's festering, violent
clash over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Javed Jabbar, an adviser to Musharraf on national affairs, told
reporters in Multan, a city in the Punjab, that the talks between
Clinton and Pakistani officials would focus on Kashmir and other
basic issues. He called the president's decision to visit
``important for peace and progress in South Asia and it justifies
our stand.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was a blow to India's prime minister, who ``has
been continuously trying to malign Pakistan and encourage the U.S.
to declare it a terrorist state.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Pakistani press also painted the president's
decision as a victory over India. The News, an influential
newspaper that was formerly edited by the military regime's
ambassador to the United States, called Clinton's decision a
triumph for the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Washington has had a business-as-usual attitude toward
Pakistan's military rulers on the core issues at least, doubts were
persisting as to where exactly did it place the new political
arrangement in Pakistan,'' the paper said. ``President Clinton's
visit will, to a considerable degree, remove these doubts and will
help Musharraf stand on firmer ground internationally.''

CLINTON URGES PASSAGE OF CHINESE TRADE LEGISLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton formally asked Congress on
Wednesday to grant China permanent U.S. trading privileges, a move
that if approved could pave the way for the communist regime in
Beijing to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Clinton
said establishing permanent trade ties would not only help open
long-closed Chinese markets to U.S. goods, but would hasten reforms
inside China, particularly in the area of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for approval look good in the Senate, where at
least 60 senators are expected to support it despite concerns about
human rights abuses in China and criticism from organized labor
that it will cost U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The labor and human rights issues are expected to provoke a
bitter fight in the House, however, especially among Democrats,
many of whom will side with organized labor in opposing permanent
normal trade relations, known as PNTR.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough to get the votes,'' said China trade
supporter House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. But he
predicted it will pass if Clinton can convince reluctant Democrats
to back it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton characterized it as a national security issue of
historic proportions. ``It is clearly in our national interest. It
represents the most significant opportunity that we have had to
create positive change in China since the 1970s, when President
Nixon first went there,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can work to pull China in the right direction or we can
turn our backs and almost certainly push it in the wrong
direction,'' he added, calling on lawmakers to choose engagement
with China over isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Congress to act on legislation granting the PNTR
status by early summer to prevent the issue from becoming embroiled
in the politics of this year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said the Republican leadership, which is united behind the
PNTR legislation, will do what it can to hold rank-and-file
Republicans together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to and expect to see us pass it,'' Armey told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
described the PNTR legislation as ``a good first step'' in helping
to open more of China's markets to U.S. exports ranging from
agricultural goods to cars and telecommunications. He called it a
``bread and butter issue for American workers, farmers and their
families'' that would also result in lower prices at home.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, China will no longer have to undergo an annual
review by Congress and the administration in order to have its
normal trade status renewed each year. By becoming a permanent
trading partner, China would be guaranteed the same low-tariff
access to American markets that nearly every other country enjoys
now.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent U.S. trading privileges would also help China in its
quest to become a member of the World Trade Organization, which is
instrumental in setting international trade standards. China,
however, would still have to win agreements from the European Union
and other WTO members before being invited into the global trade
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at John Hopkins, Clinton emphasized the importance
of establishing a permanent trade relationship with Beijing, saying
it will enable the nation to ``export products without exporting
jobs.'' He said the agreement worked out last year with China and
incorporated in the PNTR legislation would require Beijing to open
its consumer market, the largest in the world, ``in unprecedented
ways'' to U.S. goods and services. In return, he said all the
United States has promised to do ``is maintain the present access''
China now has to markets here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress passes PNTR, we reap these rewards. If Congress
rejects it, our competitors reap these rewards,'' Clinton said,
adding that Congress ``must understand the consequences of saying
no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't sell our products to China, someone else will step
into the breach and we'll spend the next 20 years wondering why in
the world we handed over the benefits we negotiated to other
people,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to boost congressional support, Clinton has allied
himself with a coalition of U.S. business interests with trade ties
to China, including the Business Roundtable organization and
National Chamber of Commerce. The coalition has already started
running television and radio commercials, warning that the upcoming
votes on PNTR amount to a decision about whether the United States
will pursue a policy of protectionism or engagement.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, organized labor and environmental groups,
traditional allies of Clinton and the Democratic Party, are leading
the fight against PNTR for China. They argue that it will likely
result in the loss of U.S. jobs and hurt the environment because it
does not require Beijing to adopt tougher labor laws or
environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders are warning some lawmakers that they could lose
union support in the November elections if they vote to approve
PNTR for China.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is it still a bull market if it is running on only
one leg?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question investors are asking now as they ponder a
badly bifurcated stock market, where a handful of strong stocks is
surrounded by a mass of the weak.
</P>
<P>
   While most bull markets are built on strong performance from a
wide swath of industries, gains in the current market are being
made in technology stocks alone. Procter &AMP; Gamble's profit warning
on Tuesday only served to cement the view among investors that
anything nontech is a nonstarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not immediately evident from the behavior of the
broad market indexes, most shares are currently trading at bear
market levels. While the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index is down
about 7 percent for the year, more than three-quarters of the
stocks in the index are down 20 percent or more from their recent
highs, according to Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Even more surprising is data compiled by James Paulsen, chief
investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
Paulsen found that if he excised the 66 technology and
telecommunications stocks from the S&AMP;P index, the 434 companies
that remain are currently trading at the same low levels seen
during the Russian debt crisis of 1998. With technology and
telecommunications back in the index, it is up approximately 40
percent since then.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Paulsen removed technology stocks from the S&AMP;P
index and found that the price-to-earnings ratio on the median
stock in the index currently stands at around 12. That is the same
depressed level reached on the entire index during the recession of
1990. With technology stocks included, the index's price-earnings
ratio is 43.
</P>
<P>
   `'The story here is not just how well tech is doing,'' Paulsen
said. ``The story is equally that most everything else is doing so
poorly. I think it would surprise people that outside of
technology, the United States' blue-chip stock market may break
down below the lowest point of the Asian crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   This lopsided action in stocks is both unusual and confusing.
For example, stocks in many sectors _ banks, consumer durables and
basic materials _ are trading at depressed levels that historically
have foretold a recession. But the economy is so hot that Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is threatening to
raise interest rates again later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, technology stocks behave as though they are
completely immune to the ill effects of rising interest rates,
hardly a realistic assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Because the strength in technology shares masks the weakness in
everything else, the divided stock market also poses problems for
Greenspan. In recent speeches and testimony, the Fed chairman has
singled out the wealth effect created by rising portfolio values as
an engine driving the currently hot economy. And he has threatened
to raise rates as far as he must to cool the economy and the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, his rate increases have only damaged stocks that
were already down, not the highfliers he may have hoped to rein in.
And that only pushes more investors into the already hot stocks,
driving their prices ever higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan is mistaken about the wealth effect,'' said Stefan
D. Abrams, chief investment officer for asset allocation at Trust
Co. of the West. ``He's missing the bifurcation. While 50 stocks
are racing, the other 450 S&AMP;P stocks are losers. Every time he
plays the Cassandra, he has the effect of accelerating the boom in
the hot stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, investors have characterized this tale of two
stock markets as a divide between the Old Economy stocks, which are
hit hard by rising interest rates, and the new, supercharged tech
stocks that are not. But many economists say this view will be
proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I see with the tech sector is it ultimately has
cyclicality to it,'' said William Dudley, chief U.S. economist at
Goldman, Sachs. ``People may be a little bit too optimistic
thinking that tech is insulated from what happens elsewhere in the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen agrees. He believes that the Fed will succeed in slowing
the economy down and that this will bring the bull market in young
technology companies to a screeching halt. ``A slower economy would
raise the risks inherent in venture capital financing,'' he said.
``It would dry up equity capital flows and kill off these
companies' method of financing their operations. I think that is
likely over the course of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's all-tech, all-the-time stock market looks a lot like the
1970s when commodity stocks were the only gainers. What began in
the 1960s as an all-inclusive stock market was transformed in the
1970s by inflation. Only those companies, like steel makers and oil
producers, that could pass along higher prices to customers were
hot. Everything else faded, and ultimately the entire market did as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The current situation, while similar in its narrow focus, is
driven by disinflation. While the early years of the current bull
market rewarded the majority of companies, now only those companies
that are able to produce goods at ever cheaper prices are faring
well, like technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Paulsen is worried that many companies have
reached the zenith of productivity and will no longer be able to
reduce prices. This would threaten their power status in the
market. ``What I see now are a lot of companies saying we might be
reaching the limit of being able to produce more with less,'' he
said. ``Price competition is becoming too extreme in many parts of
the economy and more companies are reporting margin problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble is the most recent victim of this, but market
darlings Dell Computer, Wal-Mart and Compaq Computer have also
warned about margin pressures recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists think the extreme stock market disparities of
today will soon ease and that beaten down stocks will recover. ``My
own personal opinion is the disparity between these two areas has
gotten awfully wide,'' Dudley said. A result: Investors will find
some stocks too cheap to pass up. Companies with depressed stock
prices may also take themselves private.
</P>
<P>
   What about technology stocks? ``Whenever you have momentum
investing it's hard to say when it's going to peter out,'' Dudley
said. ``I don't see anything near term that will puncture that
bubble.'' Longer term, however, he doubts that earnings among tech
companies can continue to grow at 25 percent or more while the
economy is growing at a much slower pace.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen thinks that if the economy slows, the broader market
will rebound. ``Technology would no longer be the big deal,'' he
said. ``The inflation scares go away and interest-rate-sensitive
parts of the stock market will pick up. So will big consumer
companies with good unit growth.''

 &HT;    City at odds over Confederate general
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Driving along Monument Avenue, past the massive
stone statues of Robert E. Lee and other Confederate warriors,
Charles Chambliss said in disgust, ``Somehow the Confederacy made
the losers look honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, more than 500 patrons of the Museum of the
Confederacy will, in fact, gather to salute Lee. They'll attend the
museum's Grand Southern Ball, a fund-raiser selling, among other
memorabilia, baseball caps inscribed with Lee's signature for $15
each.
</P>
<P>
   Though dead since 1870, five years after his surrender at
Appomattox, Va., ended the Civil War, the Confederate
general-in-chief is at the center of controversy. In recent weeks,
a downtown mural of Lee has been torched and his reputation
defended in a dispute over how history should be marked here in the
capital of the Old Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fight that heritage groups say embodies a resolve by
civil rights leaders to rid the South of Confederate symbols _
including the Rebel banner flying atop the South Carolina
Statehouse and embodied in the state flags of Georgia and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Richmond, a bastion of Confederate relics and
remembrances, a growing chorus, including Mayor Timothy Kaine, says
it's time for the majority black city to honor African-Americans.
Or, just as importantly, some say it's appropriate to recognize the
misery of the half a million African slaves who were bought and
sold along the James River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one more dime should be spent on another Confederate
rendering until African-American personalities and heroes are
included in some kind of plan to accurately and fairly present
history on public property,'' Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
   As a black lawyer practicing in Richmond since 1978, Chambliss,
52, fought on behalf of erecting a statue on Monument Avenue
honoring Richmond native and African-American tennis great Arthur
Ashe. It was raised in 1996, despite protests by heritage groups
that the stately boulevard was hollowed ground of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chambliss is in position to wield even greater influence.
</P>
<P>
   He is chairman of the city's ad hoc historical interpretation
committee, created by the City Council to advise it on how to
reflect history in the naming of monuments, bridges and other
public property.
</P>
<P>
   The committee plans its second meeting March 23, hoping to agree
on a plan that will avoid a replay of the nasty fight over the Ashe
monument and, last month, over the renaming of two city bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council renamed the bridges in honor of two Richmond
civil rights leaders, Samuel Tucker and Curtis Holt. Their names
replaced those of Confederate generals J.E.B. Stuart and Stonewall
Jackson, who also are honored by Monument Avenue statues.
</P>
<P>
   The most protracted fight has been over Lee, whose statue is the
biggest and most ornate along Monument Avenue, reflecting adoration
that is now being challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is historical fact about Robert E. Lee,'' said William
Martin, director of Richmond's Valentine Museum. ``But rather than
deal with Lee as a person, we deal with him as a symbol.'' Last
spring, the foundation redeveloping Richmond's waterfront sparked
controversy when it hoisted a mural-sized portrait of Lee in his
uniform. Richmond City Councilman Sa'ad El-Amin protested,
comparing Lee to Nazi leaders and expressing a view simmering under
the surface in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin said the city's Confederate monuments, erected in an era
when white people controlled city government, are offensive to many
black people.
</P>
<P>
   The Historic Richmond Riverfront Foundation removed the mural,
part of a pictorial city history consisting of 13 murals hanging
from the tall concrete flood wall along the James River.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation put up another mural of Lee, this time from a
famous portrait of the downcast general taken a few days after his
surrender at Appomattox.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 17, which Virginia celebrates as a holiday honoring
Lee, Jackson and Martin Luther King Jr., somebody set fire to the
Lee mural. Leaders of the Sons of Confederate Veterans urged police
to prosecute the yet-unsolved incident as a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, the Lee statue on Monument Avenue was
defaced by graffiti reading ``Kill the white devil,'' said Brag
Bowling, central Virginia commander for the Sons of Confederate
Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   A third Lee mural now hangs from the flood wall, and it, too,
appears to have been vandalized. What looks like a small burn
appears at the cuff of Lee's right trouser leg.
</P>
<P>
   What Bowling finds more upsetting is Lee's placement in a series
of murals also honoring Abraham Lincoln and Powhatan Beaty, a black
man who won the Medal of Honor fighting for the Union. In another
mural, the city of Richmond is in flames, with soldiers retreating
across the James River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert E. Lee had a huge role in this city,'' said Bowling,
who serves on the historical interpretation committee. Committee
member Rob Corcoran believes that the panel will spur constructive
talk about race and, in the end, bring about respect for different
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how does Richmond tell its story in such a way
that is honest and inclusive?'' said Corcoran, national director
for Hope in the Cities, a Richmond-based group aimed at racial
reconciliation. ``Everybody's reality is important and needs to be
respected.''

SOUTHEASTERN ASSET MANAGEMENT ACQUIRES 6 PERCENT STAKE IN AETNA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Calif., Ill.)  By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Southeastern Asset Management Inc., a money management company
based in Memphis, said Wednesday that it had acquired a 6 percent
stake in Aetna Inc. for $444 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Southeastern paid $52.46 each, on average, for most of
its 8.5 million shares between Jan. 6 and last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Aetna rose $2.9375, to $54.125, on the New York Stock
Exchange Wednesday on the news of Southeastern's purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which slid to a 12-month low of $38.50 three weeks
ago, has rebounded since Aetna, the nation's biggest health
insurer, confirmed last week that it was considering a possible
buyout from WellPoint Health Networks, a California-based national
managed-care company, and the ING Group, a Dutch financial services
and insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Wellpoint and ING said they might offer $70 a share if they were
satisfied with Aetna's prospects after examining the company's
books.
</P>
<P>
   William Donaldson, who replaced Richard Huber as chief executive
of Aetna in a boardroom revolt on Feb. 25, has been meeting with
investment bankers and other advisers to consider strategies for
dealing with several trouble spots in Aetna's health care business
and other lines.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that there was no guarantee that Wellpoint and
ING would actually offer $70. No competing bids have emerged for
the health care units, although several prospective buyers are said
to be interested in Aetna's international and financial management
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern, which manages the Longleaf Partners Funds, had
$13.4 billion under management on Jan. 21. Andrew McCarroll, a
spokesman for Southeastern, declined to comment yesterday on the
SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Southeastern's chairman, O. Mason Hawkins, looked
for stocks that were selling at 60 percent or less of their real
value, as measured by his research. By that formula, he seemed to
be valuing Aetna shares at more than $85 each, said Christopher
Traulsen, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., the investment research
firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must think that a transaction is going to take place,''
said Lori M. Price, a securities analyst at Chase H&AMP;Q. But Traulsen
said that Southeastern typically stuck by its investments for long
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern said in the SEC filing that it had paid as little
as $38.935 for Aetna shares on Feb. 18. Undeterred by the rise
after the Wellpoint-ING offer emerged, it bought 35,000 more shares
last week at $60.438 each. Shares were trading as high as $99.875
last May.
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern said in the filing that its strategy was to
identify and buy stock in ``undervalued companies'' and then hold
discussions with executives of the companies and other interested
parties to suggest ways to make the shares reflect ``the company's
true intrinsic value.''

STOCKS CLOSE HIGHER AS BARGAIN-SEEKERS ARE ACTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks staged a modest rebound Wednesday, overcoming
early jitters to close broadly higher as oil prices eased and a
Federal Reserve survey found inflation still limited despite
intensified pressure on wages.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain seekers scooped up shares of drug and other depressed
issues, including industrial stalwarts like Alcoa and International
Paper, after two days of battering that had knocked 571 points off
the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   The index closed 60.50 points, or 0.62 percent, higher at
9,856.53, but was still nearly 16 percent below the record it set
in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also turned in a solid performance, with the
Nasdaq market gaining 49.42 points, or 1.02 percent, to 4,897.26,
just short of its peak last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting a little more rational and rotating into
companies that have been annihilated'' in the correction of
so-called ``old economy'' stocks, said Donna Van Vlack, chief
trader at Brandywine Asset Management. ``A lot of babies have been
thrown out with a lot of bathwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, suffering regulatory fears and, in some cases,
patent expirations, surged with the aid of recommendations from at
least three Wall Street houses. Bristol-Myers gained 4 1/4 to 47
3/4, Schering-Plough 3 5/16 to 33 13/16 and Pfizer 2 7/16 to 32
7/16. Others followed along, including Warner-Lambert, up 5 13/16
to 86 13/16; American Home Products, up 3 7/8 to 45 3/8, and Merck,
up 2 7/8 to 56 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines benefited from a sharp decline in the price of oil
after Saudi Arabia and Iran sent a strong signal of significant
production increases. Continental and Delta climbed nearly four
points each while AMR, parent of American, and U.S. Airways each
gained more than three.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Atlantic-Richfield, which gained 5 3/8, to 81, on
seemingly improved prospects for its acquisition by BP Amoco, most
major oil companies gave up fractions of a point following big
runups, but those engaged mainly in exploration fell sharply.
Schlumberger and B.J. Services lost more than five points each
while Halliburton lost more than four.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued to favor companies offering shares to the
public for the first time. Wednesday's star was Crayfish, a
Japanese company that provides e-mail hosting services for
businesses. Its 4.35 million American depository receipts, priced
at $24.50, began trading at 96 and soared as high as 166 before
closing at 126 on volume of 7.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a rebound in industrial shares, like Alcoa's 2 7/16 gain
to 67 3/8 and International Paper's 2 41/64 gain to 36 1/64, ``we
continue to think the tech stocks will lead'' the market, said Todd
Salamone, research director at Schaeffer's Investment Research in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that Cincinnati-based Procter &AMP; Gamble, which
plunged nearly 31 percent on Tuesday after warning of lower
profits, would skid further, along with other consumer stocks that
remain fairly expensive by historic standards. The stock fell 3
1/16 Wednesday to 57 15/16, less than half the 118 3/8 at which it
traded at its peak on Jan. 12. More than 37 million shares changed
hands compared with 68 million on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index advanced 11.08 points, or 0.82
percent, to 1,366.70, with 268 issues up, 218 down and 14
unchanged. Oracle was one of the biggest contributors, jumping 8
3/16 to 83 1/8, but other technology stocks were also strong. JDS
Uniphase, however, fell 11 3/4 after disclosure that Goldman Sachs
sold 816,819 shares last month.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered
advancing ones, 1,537 to 1,445 on heavy volume of 1.22 billion
shares, just below Tuesday's _ the second-busiest on record. New
52-week lows swamped new highs by 253 to 50.

<P>
   RICHMOND, Mass. _ The hand-cranked phone boxes are long gone.
The party lines are, too. But residents of this tiny former mining
town in the Berkshires still dial the operator when they need the
local news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone called to ask who picks up the trash,'' said Melissa
Perdue, a customer care specialist with Richmond Telephone Co., the
local exchange. ``We pretty much know everything about the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond is in many ways not your typical phone company. Its
headquarters is a green-shuttered, white clapboard house on Route
41, in far-western Massachusetts just shy of the New York state
border. It has 13 employees, including a one-man repair crew named
Maurice. Its phone book listings are 12 pages long, representing
1,168 residents and businesses. And it has handled the calls here
for 97 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Hanson, 82, has known no other phone company. Richmond
installed her first dial phone in the 1960s and, before that, ran
her parents' party line. ``When I heard someone ring two long and
two short, I knew that was mine,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   As archaic as it may seem, more than 1,000 small, independent
phone companies like Richmond Telephone still do business, mostly
in rural areas of the nation. Each incumbent, as they are known in
the industry, handles as few as 60 access lines or as many as
50,000, and altogether they serve nearly 5 million customers. Many
are family-run companies, dating to the early 1900s, that were
never part of the Ma Bell system, were never bought out by
competitors and were basically left to their own devices all these
years.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they have stayed in the dark ages of telecommunication.
Richmond Telephone's old magneto switchboard was long ago retired
to a museum in Springfield, said the company's Lorinda
Ackley-Mazur. Like many other independents, her company, with
roughly 1,200 access lines, provides services like call waiting and
call answering, just like Bell Atlantic, the dominant company in
the Northeast, with nearly 44 million access lines. Richmond
installed fiber optic cable in 1996, and last year it began
Richmond NetWorx, an Internet access service. High-speed
connections are also available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus we have excellent customer service,'' Ackley-Mazur said,
a contention that is hard to refute when a first name and a street
are usually all that any of the four customer-care specialists need
to find an account. One customer, Patrick Hanavan, said he stopped
by the Richmond Telephone offices to sign up for call answering and
found the service activated by the time he made the five-minute
trip home.
</P>
<P>
   Another praised the prompt repairs. ``They don't tell you that
you have to wait when the phone gives out,'' said Tynia Harrington,
44, a cook at a restaurant in nearby Lenox. ``They'll get right on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic rate is just $12.50 a month, but calls outside the
five-square-mile Richmond service area and Pittsfield, the nearest
urban area, count as long distance. That does not bother
Harrington, who usually drops off her payment in person so she can
chat with the employees. ``I can be late on a bill,'' she said.
``I'll say, `Is two weeks OK?' And they'll say, `That's fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Garofoli, 41, the company's sole repairman for the last
21 years, is so well known that customers often call him at home
when they have trouble. Having the only repair truck in town makes
him popular for other reasons, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I change the light bulbs in the Town Hall, put the rope on the
flag,'' he said good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond Telephone was formed in 1903, when a group of town
residents paid $70 each to become shareholders. Back then, about
6,000 small phone companies were started out of necessity, in areas
around the country that the Bell system had overlooked as
unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't in there to make money,'' said Martha Silver, a
spokeswoman for the Organization for the Promotion and Advancement
of Small Telephone Companies, a Washington-based trade group.
``Many of them, 100 years ago, they were farmers. They were in many
ways pioneers.'' Eventually, through mergers and consolidations,
largely since 1950, the numbers dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as phone service becomes an increasingly important economic
factor to even the most rural places, little telephone companies
that serve out-of-the-way communities are finding themselves in
demand by new business. A village in Maine is now home to a credit
card call center; a Midwest farm town can employ dozens of
residents as telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Richmond, with its pastoral setting, has attracted
its share of business people, mostly telecommuters, and Richmond
Telephone is setting up more and more home offices. Last September,
Hanavan, 33, forsook San Francisco for the quiet of a five-acre
farm here, but he still dials in to his employer in Seattle through
dedicated fax, modem and computer lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here I was a bit nervous,'' said Hanavan, the director
of East Coast sales for SpotTaxi.com, the Web site of Central Media
Inc., an audio distributor. ``Then Maurice came over and hooked me
up. I'm not missing a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond Telephone bills itself on the cover of its slim blue
phone book as ``the small company with big connections,'' and
Ackley-Mazur says that is not an illusion of grandeur. In January,
the company burst out of its comfortable niche to offer local,
long-distance and Internet service to all of Berkshire County, a
market of about 42,000 access lines, essentially putting itself
head to head with Bell Atlantic. For now, Richmond Telephone is
leasing Bell Atlantic lines and providing long-distance services in
partnership with GFC Communications of Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The direct competition, said John H. Johnson, a spokesman for
Bell Atlantic, is ``good for consumers and it represents growth in
the industry.'' It also serves another important purpose, as Bell
Atlantic needs to show that its market is open to competition as it
awaits federal approval to move into the long-distance market in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rex G. Mitchell, an analyst for Banc of America Securities, said
many rural telephone companies, already set up to serve the more
costly low-population areas, are finding that they can branch out
into neighboring towns without much added expense. That is a result
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed federal
regulators to push down the cost of leasing phone lines to
jump-start competition.
</P>
<P>
   Independents that do not grow seem headed for consolidation, he
said, as the swirl of acquisitions and mergers in the
telecommunications industry has affected the rural areas. The
former Bell companies have not shown much interest because arcane
regulations make such acquisitions too costly. But consolidators,
companies that specialize in acquiring telecommunications
businesses in rural markets, have been snapping up local access
lines at $2,400 to $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Ackley-Mazur is aware of the big money involved. Two years ago,
when she was acting president and general manager for the Taconic
Telephone Corp. of nearby Chatham, N.Y., a concern her grandfather
founded in 1908, the company was acquired by MJD Communications
Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., a consolidator, for $67.5 million. Taconic
had grown to have more than 24,000 access lines and interests in
cellular, wireless and cable. Divesting, she said, was the most
profitable move for Taconic's 240 shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Silver, the trade group spokeswoman, said she expected
most small incumbents to retain their independence for some time;
only about 20 or 30 are sold each year, she said, usually when no
one wants to take the helm of the family business.
</P>
<P>
   As for Richmond Telephone, Ackley-Mazur said she had made it
clear that she wanted to expand the company, not sell it. For one
thing, she likes keeping the business in the family, the way it has
been since her father, J. Benedict Ackley, bought it from the
remaining 22 shareholders in 1961. He is still chairman and still
regularly goes over the books.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her small-town surroundings, Ackley-Mazur is as
closed-lipped as the president of any private company. She would
not comment about the company's finances except to say that the
established telephone part of the business was profitable. She
would not even say what her father paid for the company 39 years
ago. ``I know he borrowed the money from his mother,'' she said.
``His father wouldn't give it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet another generation seems set in place. Ackley-Mazur's
daughter, Catherine Dullaghan, was also raised in the phone
business. She dropped off phone books at age 14 and flagged traffic
for the repair truck and installed cable during her college breaks.
Now 26 and a business school graduate, she manages marketing and
customer care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't a decision for me,'' she said. ``I just knew
I was going to be here.''

PRO-CLINTON VOTE BOOSTED GORE, EXIT POLLS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When told at a news conference last month that he
was casting a shadow over the presidential campaign, President
Clinton laughed and quipped, ``I'd like to think I'm casting a
little sunshine over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's clean sweep over Bill Bradley in the 13
states that held Democratic primaries Tuesday proved Clinton's
statement to be no exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knocked out Bradley on the strength of Democratic voters
who hold a favorable opinion of Clinton as a person and approved of
him as president, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in the New England states _ where many Democratic
primary voters say they like Clinton's polivies but disapprove of
him as a person _ that Bradley made it much more of a competitive
race, though he failed to win a single primary.
</P>
<P>
   Among such voters in New England and elsewhere Bradley trumped
Gore. The former New Jersey senator's problem, however, was that
there weren't enough of those voters _ less than a quarter of all
Democratic Primary voters in any state disapprove of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is rare for a sitting vice president to not win his
party's nomination, many political analysts had wrongly predicted
that White House fundraising and sex scandals and Clinton's
impeachment would hurt Gore, even among Democratic constituencies
where voters may have grown tired of the president's problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, as New York pollster Lee Miringhoff put it Wednesday, ``The
words `Clinton fatigue' were not part of the vocabulary last
night.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change as the candidates gear up for the November
election, and if George W. Bush captures the Republican nomination
and tries to tap into the small pool of Democrats who dislike
Clinton, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley feared alienating Democratic voters by making the
primary contest a referendum on Clinton's ethics, and by extension
Gore's, Bush is unlikely to be as reticent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question on the Republican side that George Bush
wants to turn this into a referendum on Clinton. But what he wants
to do is turn it on Clinton the person, not necessarily Clinton the
president,'' said Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But, Charles O. Jones, an emeritus professor of political
science at the University of Wisconsin, said that given the
public's contentment with the economy, ``I don't think that's going
to be a super easy sell for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, Al Gore can turn to George Bush and say,
`George, but I am not Bill Clinton,' '' said Miringoff. ``So it's
an attack with limited value.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a self-professed political junkie, watched the election
night returns with about 50 friends, former Gore staffers, and
several members of the House and Senate in the White House theater.
He telephoned Gore about 9:30 p.m. to offer his congratulations,
obviously heartened by the bouquet the vice president tossed when
he credited Clinton with creating 21 million new jobs, reforming
welfare, bringing down crime and helping to create the longest
economic expansion in peacetime.
</P>
<P>
   A White House aide who watched the returns with Clinton said the
President was elated for Gore. Asked whether the president took
some of the credit for Gore's success over Bradley among Democrats
who like Clinton, the aide said, ``It wasn't about us. It was the
vice president's day.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted in 11 of the 13 states that held Democratic
primaries showed that Clinton's policies are far more popular than
the president is as a person, but in every place except New England
a clear majority like both the president and his policies. The exit
polls were conducted Tuesday for the Associated Press and
television networks by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why vice presidents win nominations'' Ornstein said.
``Unless there is some absolute disaster out there, people who vote
in the president's party's primary'' almost always vote for the
president's choice.

CLINTON SEEKS PERMANENT TRADE STATUS FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Touching off an election-year battle that could
divide his own political party, President Clinton asked Congress
Wednesday to give China the same trade privileges that the United
States gives to nearly all other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent lawmakers a bill that would eliminate the annual
votes on whether to give China favorable trading terms. Congress
has always extended the favored status for China, but the annual
exercise gives critics a chance to attack China's human-rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must approve the permanent trade privileges to
implement a tariff-cutting treaty that the Clinton administration
negotiated with China last year. The vote is also a key step toward
allowing China to enter the World Trade Organization, though the
WTO itself, and not Congress, has ultimate say over whether China
joins the international trading body.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vote against (permanent trade relations) will cost America
jobs as our competitors in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere capture the
Chinese market that we otherwise would have served,'' Clinton told
a friendly audience at Johns Hopkins University's international
studies school.
</P>
<P>
   He said better trade relations will pay more than economic
dividends. The vote in Congress offers ``the most significant
opportunity that we have had to create positive change in China
since the 1970s, when President Nixon first went there, and later
in the decade when President Carter normalized relations,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am working as hard as I can to convince Congress and the
American people to seize this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts businesses exported goods worth $235 million to
China in 1998, double the value of 1993. China ranked as the
state's 17th-largest export market, according to the US Department
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Trade issues have been contentious in Congress in recent years.
Lawmakers have refused to give Clinton expanded powers to negotiate
trade treaties, even though four previous presidents had those same
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, prospects for the China measure have weakened
recently, as lawmakers reacted angrily to Chinese threats last
month to use military force against Taiwan. Those threats and other
signs of weakening support prompted Clinton to bring the measure to
Congress more quickly than the White House had planned.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could be particularly difficult for Democrats, who
must choose between supporting Clinton and siding with organized
labor, which opposes normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this juncture, we still have some leverage associated with
the annual status review,'' said David Smith, director of public
policy for the AFL-CIO. ``We have a country that is without any
question the world's biggest violator of human rights. . . . Why on
earth is the appropriate response to this behavior to say, `We'll
give you a blank check and grant you normal relations?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Business groups say it is vital for lawmakers to approve the
measure so that the new trade treaty takes effect. That treaty
would sharply cut tariffs on a variety of products and make it
easier for US telecommunications, insurance, banking, and service
providers to reach Chinese consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking out all the stops on this thing,'' said William
Morley, chief trade lobbyist for the US Chamber of Commerce. ``This
is a top priority for the business community. It goes to the bottom
line of jobs and opportunities for our workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate historically has been more supportive of trade deals
than has the House. The House Democratic leader, Representative
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, has so far stated no position on the
China measure. The number two House Democrat, David Bonior of
Michigan, opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Clinton must do more to win support within his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we're not going to get any help from Democrats in the
House unless the president gets the votes,'' said House majority
leader Dick Armey, Republican of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that voting against normal trade relations ``won't
free a single prisoner or create a single job in America or
reassure a single American ally in Asia. It will simply empower the
most rigid anti-democratic elements in the Chinese government. . .
. Our friends and allies would wonder why, after 30 years of
pushing China in the right direction, we turned our backs, now that
they finally appear to be willing to take us up on it.''

   PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad _ The half-dressed Carnival masqueraders
who had flowed through the streets like a glittering, feathery
river were gone Wednesday morning. Gone, too, were the body-rocking
calypso rhythms that had turned the city into a giant boom box.
</P>
<P>
   For Steve Richards, the worry was not what was gone, but who had
vanished. He runs Rebirth House, a drug rehabilitation program that
operates four recovery homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today what I have to do is a damage assessment,'' he said as
he prepared to survey his group's residences and see if anyone had
forgotten the 12 Steps of Recovery amid the dance steps of the
party that had just rolled through town. ``Carnival season brings
casualties. Those who don't resist that festive mood. The
temptation. They just paid the penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnival season, the weeks-long pre-Lenten party that was
crowned with two days of dancing and drinking this week, is not an
easy time for Richards or his 69 charges. He spent much of it with
some of them, running a safe haven in his group's downtown office,
where they watched the party glide by the front door with a sign
reading ``But for the Grace of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people celebrate Carnival without overdoing it, relishing
the steel-band symphonies, laughing at the bawdy and politically
charged calypso songs or preening and prancing in extravagant
costumes _ all things that are rightly a point of Trinidadian
cultural pride.
</P>
<P>
   Some lose themselves in the sensual smorgasbord, just as they do
at Carnival in Rio or Mardi Gras in New Orleans, before ushering in
the solemn season and looking for repentance with a cross of ashes
smudged on their foreheads on Ash Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a keen awareness among people like Richards
that the morning after, and the months after, bring their own
consequences that are both a reminder of mortal frailty and an
opportunity for new beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after Carnival it takes a while before admissions pick
up,'' Richards said. ``You realize, when you're an addict and your
addictions come again, you pick up where you left off. A woman
offers you a drink _ you want to prove yourself. The ego thing.
`How can I refuse a drink from a woman?'''
</P>
<P>
   At the Port of Spain General Hospital on Monday afternoon, the
throbbing music blasting from huge speakers strapped to the
Carnival trucks filtered into the emergency room, where doctors
treated everything from sprains to stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   One of those on duty, Dr. Joseph Olowe, said many of the
injuries were alcohol-related. Although the real rush of patients
comes after midnight, a different rush will come in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Carnival there is a high incidence of being free
sexually,'' he said. ``In two or three months' time the abortion
rate will go up. In nine months the birth rate also increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting concern over infection with HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, and over unwanted pregnancies, public health groups
prepared for the season with an education campaign, and banners
were unfurled along many streets reading: ``Sex? Latex!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to see what kind of response the public has toward
that kind of awareness,'' Olowe said. ``That is beyond anybody's
control. You do the best to educate people. But at the point of the
decision in terms of moral practice, that is left to different
people's will.''
</P>
<P>
   At Rebirth House, counselors offered extra reminders and advice
to those who wanted to go out and join the festivities. They were
urged to attend more 12-step meetings and to steer clear of old
drinking and drugging buddies. Those who did not get to go out on
their own were still able to ``lime,'' or hang out, at the downtown
office and cheer the passing parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know if you lime with us, you won't have any beer,'' said
Vincent Megaries, a project coordinator at Rebirth House. ``They
can go to the park and see the bands and come back here to keep
themselves strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was difficult for people like Stephen Dey, who had just
joined the program after a two-month cocaine binge. Last week he
hit the number and spent his small windfall on cocaine, leaving him
exhausted and suicidal. Three days sober on Tuesday, he quietly sat
inside the shade of the group's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be here,'' he said. ``I stand out there and
people pass by, and I can smell the marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the alcohol outside did not unnerve him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not getting urges as such for drugs,'' he said. ``Part of
my addiction is a sexual thing. You're seeing all these women out
there gyrating.''
</P>
<P>
   To learn how to enjoy these events and stay sober is the point
of the group's mission. Richards relishes the Carnival, but it is
more important to him that he show the residents that life
continues without drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dance and hug and kiss the women, but it's like a hobby, and
I know my limits,'' Richards said. ``No matter what you do, you got
to live outside there. You can't cloister yourself. You got to deal
with it out there. The world is not going to stop just because
you're a recovering person.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar belief inspired Bishop David Ibeleme, a Pentecostal
minister, to offer a Christian alternative to the sometimes lewd
calypso lyrics that float through the air this season.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year, he sponsored a ``Gospelypso'' concert at his
church last week, with songs that were more morally uplifitng.
Religion, he said, must exist in a cultural context, even if some
of his more conservative counterparts look warily at his love of
calypso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christianity is not in a cultural vacuum,'' he said. ``It has
to embrace the culture of the people. That is the only way to
fulfill the Scripture that says, `Every tribe and tongue must come
unto him.'''
</P>
<P>
   While he knew that not everyone would attend the concert _ some
200 people showed up this year _ he held out the hope that the
message would penetrate even the hardest-partying people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is within the next few months after Carnival,
it tends to be easier for people to get to know God,'' he said.
``They done what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether out of repentance or respect, many people _ including
more than a few revelers _ filed into the Roman Catholic Cathedral
of the Immaculate Conception this morning to receive ashes. In the
weeks before, mainline religious groups urged the faithful to enjoy
the Carnival with dignity and respect for others. After all, to
lose yourself in joy does not mean you lose your soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something deeply spiritual about that abandon,'' said
the Rev. Christian Pereira, the cathedral's administrator. ``While
they abandon themselves to music and revelry, time does not matter.
You have in the spiritual life an abandoning of yourself to God,
giving yourself totally to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The season, he said, is a great leveler, when rich and poor and
people of all races unite, first in celebration and later in
solemnity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes for a healthy society,'' he said. ``They say we do
not have that many people in mental hospitals here than in
countries that do not have Carnival.''

RESEARCH SHEDS LIGHT ON RECOVERY PERIOD AFTER SPECIES BECOME
EXTINCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Corrects time element, Thursday instead of Wednesday in grafs
2 and 6.)  
(lh) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past 500 million years, there have been dozens of
episodes of extinction on the planet, the most famous being the
titanic event that swept away the dinosaurs. Scientists have
assumed that the time it takes for the living world to bounce back
is proportional to the damage done: More time should be required to
fill all of the earth's empty corners with newly evolved life after
gargantuan extinctions and less time should be required after a
more minor die-off.
</P>
<P>
   But in an entirely unexpected finding that has gotten the
attention of both paleontologists and conservationists, researchers
reported Thursday that it takes a long time to recover from these
large-scale extinctions _ around 10 million years _ and more
intriguing, the recovery time appears to be the same, whether the
original destruction was one of the grander or one of the more
minor events.
</P>
<P>
   Many biologists say that by destroying tropical forests and
other habitats, humans are driving species extinct at an
accelerating rate that if unchecked will result in one of the major
extinctions in the earth's history.
</P>
<P>
   An ominous implication of the new research, some scientists say,
is that humans may already or will soon have destroyed enough
species that it will require a full 10 million years for the planet
to recover _ 20 times longer than humans have already existed and
longer than many scientists predict humanity itself is likely to
persist into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the new study will also prompt paleontologists to
rethink how life evolves after major extinctions _ events that have
played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of life.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Dr. James W. Kirchner, an earth scientist at the
University of California at Berkeley, and Dr. Anne Weil, a
paleobiologist at Duke University, appears Thursday in the journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a surprise to everyone,'' said Dr. Douglas Erwin,
a paleobiologist at the National Museum of Natural History at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington. ``We're just at the
beginning of understanding biotic recoveries following
extinctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mike Foote, a paleobiologist at the University of Chicago,
said the paper would change how people looked at the fossil record,
adding, ``It's going to be seminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing statistical techniques from other areas of geology and
astrophysics, the researchers examined an enormous set of data
gathered by the late Dr. Jack Sepkoski, a paleontologist at the
University of Chicago. The data documents when new kinds of marine
animals first appear in the fossil record and when they disappear
or go extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists expected that with every additional species that gets
knocked out during an extinction, the longer the recovery should
take. What researchers found instead was that after extinctions,
big and small, it took about 10 million years for the proliferation
of new kinds of organisms to peak and then begin to tail off. The
decrease in the proliferation of new creatures is seen as a sign
that ecosystems have recovered and are so full of diverse life that
there is little opportunity left for new organisms.
</P>
<P>
   So unexpected was the outcome, Weil said, that when Kirchner
handed her the results, she said, ``Did you do that right?'' She
added, ``I made him do the analysis again while I was looking over
his shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the new study suggested that the evolutionary
rebuilding after an extinction might work differently than had been
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Many paleontologists had previously pictured extinctions as
being the equivalent of wiping the pieces off a chessboard. In such
a situation, though the pieces are gone, the spaces on the
chessboard, the place for a queen or rook _ or in nature, the niche
for an algae-eating fish or a long-lived evergreen tree _ are still
there, each simply needing to be refilled by a newly evolved
species.
</P>
<P>
   But the new study, Erwin said, suggests instead that ``when you
wipe the pieces off the chessboard, the size of the chessboard
shrinks.'' That is, with the loss of a species comes the loss of
opportunities for the existence of other organisms as well _ like
those that would make their living by preying upon or parasitizing
that organism.
</P>
<P>
   So when there are few types of organisms left after an
extinction, there are few opportunities for new species to evolve.
Each new kind of organism that does evolve creates more
opportunities for other species, and each of those, in turn,
creates more opportunities in a kind of positive feedback loop, the
dynamics of which may be setting the recovery clock at 10 million
years.
</P>
<P>
   While some scientists are predicting that humanity will not live
to see a recovery from the extinctions it has wrought, many
questions remain. It is difficult to compare modern-day extinctions
with those viewed through the lens of the fossil record. As a
result, scientists still do not agree on whether and when humanity
will have destroyed enough species to require a 10 million year
recovery, with some saying that point has already been reached, and
others predicting it will be anywhere from 50 years to a thousand
years or more in coming.
</P>
<P>
   But if diversity is what provides the fuel for the recovery from
any extinction, as the new work suggests, then in terms of a
practical application, Dr. E.O. Wilson, an evolutionary biologist
at Harvard University, said the message was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' Wilson said, ``is that we had better take
care to hold on to the biodiversity that still exists.''

THREE AT ABC GET NEW POSITIONS IN REVAMPING OF NEWS DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ABC realigned the management of its news division
Wednesday by giving three executives new duties under the
division's president, David Westin.
</P>
<P>
   One change will be a new executive producer of the network's
evening newscast, anchored by Peter Jennings. Westin also said he
was considering a further shrinking of the number of news magazine
programs that ABC News will produce for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ABC began the current television season with four weekly
editions of its news magazine ``20/20.'' It is now down to three,
and the program's ratings have been slipping. ``It is entirely
possible that we'll go down to two,'' Westin said.
</P>
<P>
   Westin said the changes were intended to prepare ABC News for
what he called the ``radical changes'' like digital technology that
face the broadcast industry.
</P>
<P>
   To rethink ABC strategy, Westin named Paul Friedman, who has
been the executive producer of the evening newscast, ``World News
Tonight,'' to a new management position, executive vice president
and managing editor for news coverage. Westin said Friedman would
be in charge of overseeing the process of moving ABC News ``into
the new technological world.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman will also help select a new executive producer for the
newscast along with Westin and Jennings, Westin said.
</P>
<P>
   Westin named Phyllis McGrady, one the most experienced
executives at ABC, to a new post supervising all the division prime
time programs as well as its morning show ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   The third executive elevated to new duties is Bob Murphy, who
was formerly in charge of hard news for the network. Westin named
Murphy senior vice president for multimedia. He will supervise all
aspects of the news division's expansion into digital and wireless
technologies.

`BATTLE-TESTED' BUSH SETS SIGHTS ON GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Proclaiming himself ``battle-tested'' by the GOP
primary process, Gov. George W. Bush on Wednesday said the nation
will soon see the ``stark differences'' between himself and Vice
President Al Gore, the leading Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, claiming that his Super Tuesday election victories in nine
states put the Republican nomination within his grasp, said he's
not ready to dismiss the faltering challenge of Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, one day after key losses in Super Tuesday primaries had
all but killed his chances for the Republican presidential
nomination, retreated Wednesday to his vacation home in Cottonwood,
Ariz., to reassess his political future.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's political director, John Weaver, said the Arizona
senator had set no deadline for himself, despite speculation that
he may withdraw from the presidential race before the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver also dismissed speculation that McCain, who has
demonstrated strong appeal to independent and Democratic voters
with his maverick, reform-oriented campaign, would launch a
third-party bid for the White House. But he declined to rule out
that option, despite McCain's earlier insistence that he will
remain in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain beat Bush in four states, Bush captured the vast
majority of delegates to the Republican National Convention; the
upcoming primaries, including Texas and Florida, will likely give
Bush the 1,034 delegates he needs to guarantee the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   To wrap up his quest, Bush on Thursday travels to Colorado,
Wyoming and Utah, all of which have primaries Friday. This weekend,
Bush ventures to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging news conference outside the Governor's
Mansion, Bush urged Texans to participate in next week's primaries,
even if he is assured of the nomination. His comments came after he
cast his own Texas GOP primary ballot for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't tell people who I vote for, but I voted for
myself,'' the governor said. Turning to his wife, Laura, he asked,
``How about you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for you,'' she assured him.
</P>
<P>
   Until he has the nomination secured, or until McCain abandons
his candidacy, Bush said he'll take nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the appropriate time, I want to talk to John (McCain) if he
wants to. And, of course, I'm going to be reaching out to the
people he energized for the primary,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who has been shifting attention to the general
election, said he's ready to focus on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel battle-tested, and that's what a lot of people wanted
to see _ whether or not I could come through a tough primary
intact. And I feel great. I feel like we've got a good chance'' in
November, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His differences with Gore range from budget policies to moral
stances, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are happy with the status quo in Washington, then
vote for Al Gore,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are happy with Al Gore and Bill Clinton _ the tone
they set for America _ then you've got a perfect person to vote
for,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has ``not yet thought about the timetable'' for
selecting a vice presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he's made ``good progress'' in reducing pollution
in Texas, despite last year's record levels of air contamination in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston's a fast-growing town. There's a lot of automobiles,''
he said, adding that the records reflected ``one summer of
noncompliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bush said he now would meet with a group of Log Cabin
Republicans, a gay GOP group. He said his earlier refusal to meet
with some of its leaders was based on his belief that the
membership would not support him.
</P>
<P>
   And asked if homosexuality were a sin, Bush said ``we're all
sinners. That's what I believe. That's why I sought and found
redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Weaver said the Arizona senator is not ``going to
walk away from what he cares about,'' referring to McCain's
campaign-finance reform and outreach messages.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver spoke with reporters aboard the McCain campaign's
chartered airliner enroute to Arizona from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Departing from his normal campaign practice, McCain flew on a
separate plane to his home state without the media and was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said that Wednesday was a ``day of rest'' and
reassessment for the senator, members of his family and key
campaign aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The options are obvious _ staying in, getting out or other
options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said McCain wasn't ready yet to cancel campaign trips,
scheduled to begin Thursday in Colorado and Illinois.

<P>
   I was sick over the acquittal of four New York City police
officers last week in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   But Nehi knew that; that's how it is with friends. Even when
you're laughing, they know what you really feel is sadness.

husband handed me the telephone the other day. ``I was thinking,
you better be careful what you do with your wallet up there.''

always do when tears aren't enough to give you peace, that place
you search for when trying to understand why race causes people to
overreact _ to hate.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, laughter will get you there, make the
traveling easy, lift you to a new and gentler place.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, there's nothing funny about dying in a hail of
41 bullets because police officers mistake your wallet for a gun,
view you through a lens of criminality because of the color of your
skin. Nineteen times, they hit Diallo, who was unarmed. When he
finally slumped to the floor, his wallet fell out of his right
hand. Not a gun.
</P>
<P>
   After four weeks of testimony, a jury that included four
African-Americans acquitted the officers of all charges,
second-degree murder and criminally negligent homicide among them.
The officers do face a civil trial, a departmental review and,
possibly, federal civil rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   And so you laugh to keep from crying. It's the same sort of
feeling you get when you read the March issue of ``Essence''
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race on the Job,'' the headline screamed. ``How Black can you
be?''
</P>
<P>
   The implication in the question is that you can be too black, as
in sporting colorful head wraps, hanging black posters in the
office cubicle, or not black enough, as in talking ``proper'' and
avoiding the blacker brother in the mailroom.
</P>
<P>
   How black can you be? Truth is, how you answer, in many cases,
can literally make or break you in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   If you found it difficult to understand how four
African-Americans on the jury could vote for acquittal in the
Diallo case, then perhaps explaining the internal conflict some of
them feel might help explain.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Eric Warner said in his closing argument that Diallo
was doomed by the officers' perception of him, of black men in
general. You have to wonder whether the four black jurors were
operating under the same perception.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Nehi saw it. He lives near Albany, N.Y., where the
case was heard. Phyllis Allen lives in Fort Worth, and she shares
his view. So do I.
</P>
<P>
   They don't like it, don't think it's fair, but they know that
being accepted by the white establishment often means denying who
you really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe in the year 2000, we're still having this
discussion,'' Allen said. ``The race thing is never going away.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as long as African-Americans buy into the same stereotypes
that the mainstream community has. And not as long as they fear
backlash for being themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the most successful African-Americans are not the
sellouts, as the article in ``Essence'' aptly points out. The most
successful blacks are those who ``don't consciously decide to be
black. They just are black.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen admits she once tried to fit in by being different at
work.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she says, ``I'm who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, if you're African-American and male, who you are can
be deadly, and the harder you look for reasons to laugh, the harder
they are to find.

CONGRESSIONAL STUDY SUGGESTS SCALING BACK WORLD BANK, IMF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PHILIP CAUTHON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional commission Wednesday characterized
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as high-cost and
ineffective institutions and urged Congress to support scaling back
their operations.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the commission, which helps formulate U.S.
policy toward the IMF, World Bank and other multination lending
institutions, drew praise from congressional Republicans and
criticism from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   To refocus the IMF and World Bank after years of expanding
functions, the International Financial Advisory Commission proposed
limiting the IMF to last-resort lending and tailoring the World
Bank to work only with impoverished nations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, chaired by Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon
University, also recommended that both the World Bank and IMF, as
well as regional development banks, forgive the debts of heavily
indebted poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, acknowledged that
even if Congress backs the commission recommendations, the United
States alone cannot mandate reform of those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we intend to follow through with this and we have a moral
obligation to do so,'' Armey said. ``If we implement the
commission's recommendations, we will turn the IMF around.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission suggested that Congress encourage the IMF to lend
only short-term, last-resort funds at penalty rates to encourage
governments to first seek private bank loans
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the World Bank should shift its focus to providing
information and funds to reduce poverty in only the poorest of
nations, the commission said. It said that currently World Bank
funds often end up in wealthy countries or in the hands of corrupt
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   One commission member, economist Fred Bergsten, disagreed with
many of the panel's recommendations, saying they would undermine
the world economy and endanger U.S. economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority proposals would sharply increase the risk of
international economic disorder and dash the prospects of economic
development for millions of poor people,'' Bergsten said.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said that, while
the commission claims to support international lending
institutions, the commission actually aims to weaken them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when 700 million of the world's poorest people live
on a dollar a day or less, resources for the (lending institutions)
must be augmented, not slashed,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank media chief Caroline Anstey said the ``faulty
recommendations'' were based on flawed data.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we welcome review of the bank's work by both our
supporters and our critics, we find the results of this particular
review very disappointing,'' she said.

<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Jose Lima learned his lesson a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pitching winter ball in the 1998-99 offseason, as he
had done the previous nine years, the Astros righthander decided to
take three months off.
</P>
<P>
   The result? ``I was hurting,'' Lima said, referring to soreness
in his right shoulder that bothered him for most of spring training
last year.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, Lima again decided against playing winter ball when
he returned briefly to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he spent his days throwing with his younger brother
Frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different story,'' Lima said Wednesday after pitching
three innings in the Astros' 5-4 victory over the Florida Marlins.
``I think throwing some this offseason paid off. I feel like I can
be overpowering this year.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a guy who won 21 games last season, second in the
National League behind then-teammate Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   In three spring starts, Lima has shown a midseason-like mastery
of his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   His changeup has been effective. Manager Larry Dierker called
his slider Wednesday ``one of the best he's ever had.'' And Lima,
who never will be mistaken for a power pitcher, even claims to have
gained some velocity on his fastball, which in the past has been
clocked in the low 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm feels stronger,'' Lima said. ``I know I don't throw 100
mph, but I still can let hitters know I'm up there (on the
mound).''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Marlins scored two unearned runs off Lima in
the first inning after an error by third baseman Ken Caminiti. The
righthander followed by retiring seven of the final eight batters
he faced.
</P>
<P>
   He needed only 23 pitches against 13 hitters, inducing five
groundouts and three fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was typical Lima,'' catcher Tony Eusebio said. ``If you go
to the plate, you have to be ready to swing the bat or you're going
back to the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio, who has played in the Dominican winter league in the
past, said it's difficult for pitchers to adapt to a routine and
then stray from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for Latin players is they play a whole season in
the United States and play all winter to keep their body in
shape,'' Eusebio said. ``Lima didn't pitch last winter, and that
had an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start of spring training last year, Lima
encountered soreness in his right shoulder. It was diagnosed as a
muscular problem that pushed back a couple of his scheduled starts.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker has been impressed with what he has seen from a healthy
Lima this spring, particularly Sunday when he struck out four
batters and did not allow a hit in two innings against the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really looks great,'' Dierker said. ``He looks like an old
pro now. He's throwing strikes. He's ahead in the count all the
time. He's getting his slider over the plate. It's a better
breaking pitch than I've seen him have.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive, Dierker said, is the fact Lima hasn't let
his newfound stardom become a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming a starter two years ago, Lima has won 37 games,
including a career year last season when he went 21-10 with a 3.58
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging. Knowing how emotional of a guy he is
and how he likes the spotlight, I thought he might come down with a
little of the star syndrome and think he can walk out there and the
guys would just make outs for him,'' Dierker said. ``He hasn't done
that. He's been one of the first guys running laps to get in shape.
He looks like a guy trying to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what Lima had in mind this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as long as I stay healthy and I keep my arm strength
I'll be fine,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to another great
season.'' &QL;

<P>
   Whatever happened to the Phillips curve?
</P>
<P>
   You remember the Phillips curve, the relationship between
unemployment and inflation proposed by the British economist A.W.
Phillips in the late 1950s and developed into its present form in
the late 1960s by Edward Phelps and Milton Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 25 years mainstream economists' forecasts have
rested on the idea that should unemployment fall below an unknown
(but very real) level called the natural rate of unemployment, then
inflation would start to rise. And inflation would keep on rising
further until unemployment climbed back to or above its natural
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the Phillips curve is missing. All of a sudden,
economists are a lot less useful as forecasters. For as it stands
now, economists' forecasts of economic growth, unemployment and
inflation are no longer projections based on historical patterns
but, instead, pure guesses based on gut feelings about when, how,
and if the Phillips curve will return.
</P>
<P>
   If economists are to be of any use for forecasting, they need to
come up with a better _ and probably more complex _ theory about
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   When last seen during the 1990-92 recession, the Phillips curve
looked very healthy. In the second half of the 1980s the
unemployment rate fell to a low of 5.3 percent in 1989 and
inflation, which had averaged 2.4 percent a year in 1984-87, picked
up to 4.1 percent a year and rising by early 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Back then the Federal Open Market Committee _ under the
leadership of Alan Greenspan, who was relatively new as chairman at
the time _ reacted sharply by pushing up interest rates. Tighter
monetary policy and the shock to expectations from the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait caused total spending to fall. Unemployment rose
above its natural rate to a peak of 7.6 percent in June 1992. And
inflation fell.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the end of the 1980s knew exactly what the natural
rate of unemployment was. But even the most optimistic did not
think it could be lower than 5.5 percent, and even the most
pessimistic knew it could be no higher than 6.5 percent. Still, the
end of the 1980s retaught the lesson that the Phillips curve was
very real and had to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   That is why officials in the Clinton administration and the
Federal Reserve, as well as independent analysts, bit their
fingernails throughout the 1990s as they awaited the return of
rising inflation. By 1994 unemployment _ at 6.1 percent _ was in
the range where inflation had started to accelerate in the late
1980s, so the Fed spoke of undertaking pre-emptive strikes against
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no inflation followed. By 1996 the unemployment rate was as
low as it had ever been in the 1980s. Yet inflation fell to less
than 2 percent a year. By 1999 unemployment was at 4.2 percent _
well below anyone's previous estimate of the natural rate _ yet
inflation was an even-lower 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Where was the Phillips curve? There was confidence until the end
of 1997 that the Phillips curve would soon return. Temporary
special factors _ health care costs, rapid falls in computer prices
and so on _ were momentarily retarding the tendency of inflation to
rise when unemployment was lower than its natural rate.
</P>
<P>
   Such factors could not last forever, could they? Of course not.
So when their influence came to an end, inflation would begin its
rise. But years passed, and inflation did not rise.
</P>
<P>
   So mainstream economists' opinion shifted to the belief that the
natural rate of unemployment had fallen, though how far no one
really knew.
</P>
<P>
   Economists began spinning theories of what had caused the
natural rate to fall. James Medoff of Harvard began arguing in the
early 1990s that technological and organizational changes had led
the labor market to do a better job of matching workers needing
jobs to vacancies, thus substantially lowering the natural rate.
Others pointed to faster productivity growth that allowed higher
wage increases to be consistent with relative price stability.
Still others pointed to workers' fears for their jobs generated by
the memory of the recession and layoffs of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at some primal level, economists continue to believe in
something like a Phillips curve. They believe that unemployment
will fall if demand expands faster than the economy's long-run
productive capacity. And they believe that if demand keeps
expanding faster than the economy's long-run productive capacity
then, in the long run, inflation will rise.
</P>
<P>
   It is just, they kept saying, that the natural rate of
unemployment _ the signal that this long run had arrived _ has
fallen mysteriously far and mysteriously fast.
</P>
<P>
   But, truth be told, the Phillips curve has not worked well
outside America. Only in the United States has there been a
relatively stable natural rate of unemployment to serve as a
reliable indicator of when demand pressure is about to raise
inflation. Elsewhere, the causes of rising inflation have always
been too complex to be summarized by simply comparing unemployment
to even a semistable natural rate.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the United States, Douglas Staiger, Mark Watson and
James Stock pointed out in the Journal of Economic Perspectives,
the Phillips curve relationship was never as strong or as good at
forecasting inflation as was taught in intermediate macroeconomics.
</P>
<P>
   Thus perhaps the surprising thing is not that forecasts of
inflation based on the Phillips curve have gone awry the last half
decade. Perhaps the surprising thing is that the complicated
economic processes determining changes in inflation could be
summarized for so long by such a simple relationship as the
standard Phillips curve.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it is now clear that the simple theory of the
relation between inflation and unemployment that economists have
peddled for a quarter-century no longer works. If economists are to
be of any use, they need to come up with a better _ and in all
likelihood more sophisticated _ approach to understanding why
inflation rises.

GERMANY'S NEW CHOICE FOR IMF CHIEF GETS TEPID RECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defying warnings that history might repeat itself,
Germany began a diplomatic offensive to install one of its
nationals as head of the International Monetary Fund and received a
generally lukewarm reception Wednesday in both Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder began lobbying European neighbors
and the United States to support Hoerst Kohler, president of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to head the IMF.
But Schroeder misjudged, if he expected that his nation's allies
would quickly rally around the new German candidate after the first
one he promoted was forced to give up a four-month quest to lead
the monetary fund.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton pointedly declined to endorse Kohler in a
telephone conversation with the German chancellor Tuesday. White
House officials said the president had a friendly conversation with
Schroeder in which he took a neutral position on Kohler's
qualifications for the job.
</P>
<P>
   European officials also have not rushed to Germany's side.
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini delivered a frank public
assessment in which he said that Kohler was ``less than had been
hoped for.'' A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
Europe had not rallied behind Kohler, who once served as a close
aide to Helmut Kohl, Schroeder's longtime rival and predecessor as
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   French and Portuguese officials made much more positive
comments. But it seemed unlikely that Germany could forge an
immediate, Europe-wide consensus that Kohler ought to be the
region's unified choice to lead the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Germany's decision to throw its considerable
political heft behind a new candidate and campaign publicly for him
will work this time. Some German allies, including the United
States, are eager to avoid the impression that they are picking
fights with Germany, and Kohler is widely considered a better
choice than the previous candidate, Ciao Koch-Weser, Germany's
deputy finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   But it also seemed possible that Germany, by choosing a person
who does not top the lists of Europe's most qualified and
politically prominent financial officials, had set itself up for a
another stinging defeat. That is especially true because both
European and American officials have put a high priority on finding
someone who can quickly command support and end the prolonged and
divisive search for an IMF managing director.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the 182 member nations of the IMF rebuffed
Germany when they denied Koch-Weser, a close ally of Schroeder, a
majority of their votes in an informal poll. Koch-Weser had the
backing of the 15-nation European Union, which has named every IMF
managing director since the financial institution was created just
after World War II. But Europe's support was tepid, and Clinton
went public with his vow to stop the German's candidacy after
months of quiet diplomacy failed to dissuade Germany from promoting
him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other critics had argued that Koch-Weser,
a 25-year veteran of the World Bank and a specialist in poverty
relief, did not have the political stature or the financial
expertise to head the IMF, which has been likened to a world
central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler has considerably more financial experience and is better
known around Europe, but his background is in some ways similar to
Koch-Weser's.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler, 57, was long allied with the Christian Democratic Union,
the party Schroeder defeated when he took power last year. He
served as an economic aide to Kohl, the longtime chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Kohler served in the No. 2 position at
Germany's finance ministry, the position Koch-Weser holds today. In
that job, Kohler helped manage Germany's financial relations with
Europe at a time when the region was working out the details of
monetary union. But he was better known for helping to arrange the
terms of unification with Germany's formerly Communist eastern
half, and then overseeing the massive injection of public funds
aimed at rebuilding the old East Germany. He also had a stint in
the private sector, managing Germany's federation of savings banks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kohler now heads the London-based European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, a mini-World Bank that backs
development projects and businesses in Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. He took the post just after the quasi-public
bank wrote off tens of millions of dollars worth of loans when
Russia, its leading client, defaulted on its debt in the summer of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have declined to comment on
Kohler's candidacy. Moreover, they seem determined to avoid a
repeat of their role in defeating Koch-Weser, when Clinton publicly
played the heavy while some European countries hid their true
feelings behind the veil of European solidarity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But administration officials were also hoping that Europe would
select a candidate who would obviate the need for extended debate.
Among the several senior politicians in Europe talked about as
potential candidates are the current and former British chancellors
of the exchequer and the Italian finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support a European candidate, a candidate of maximum
stature, who can generate a consensus in Europe and support from
developing countries,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
Wednesday when asked about Germany's push for Kohler.
</P>
<P>
   Outside observers said that Kohler did have the resume of an IMF
leader.
</P>
<P>
   C. Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington said that Kohler had more financial expertise than
Koch-Weser and that he would do a good job at the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knock on him is this notion of stature _ that they want
someone who has had a Cabinet-level job in finance for the IMF,''
Bergsten said. ``There's also a sense that he hasn't really
distinguished himself at the EBRD.''

   BUSH-MCCAIN (Undated) _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has a
mighty mountain to climb if he is to persuade supporters of his
vanquished rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, to back him in
November against Vice President Al Gore. That was one of the
significant findings of voter surveys in several states on Tuesday
by a consortium of television networks and The Associated Press. It
suggested that the governor would do well to seek a quick
rapprochement with McCain in the hope that the senator, who
stresses his staunch Republicanism, could rally his backers against
Gore. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN-VOICE (Denver) _ The effort began three years ago as a
way to give the West a little influence in the presidential
selection process. Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah led a vigorous
bipartisan campaign to create a Western primary day for the eight
states just this side of California. It never worked out. Only
Colorado, Utah and Wyoming agreed to schedule voting on the same
day _ Friday. And now that Tuesday's results in 16 other states
have all but assured Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas their parties' nominations, the drama seems removed,
altogether, even though campaign events by both Bush and Sen. John
McCain are planned for Colorado on Thursday. By Michael Janofsky.

hand in hard dollars Bush and Gore have for the rest of the primary

LONGING FOR A BETTER LIFE IN REVOLUTIONARY CHINA

   ``Colors of the Mountain'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Da Chen &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Memoir &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $25 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given the clouds of tobacco fumes that hang above the heads of
its characters, Da Chen's ``Colors of the Mountain'' might well
have been named ``Smoke on the Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dia and I found a new spot behind the school wall, where we
met and chatted as he polluted his lungs with dark tobacco,'' Chen
writes of a youthful friend in his memoir of a south Chinese
boyhood. ``He told me the secret of the Dia tobacco. Since his
grandpa's time, they had kept a plot of land in their back yard the
size of a basketball court, where they grew broad-leaved tobacco.
The rich, bitter flavor was attributed to the fact that young Dia
each morning watered the plants with the contents of three full
night pots used overnight by the men in the Dia household. The
thick, smelly (urine) nourished the young plants and added a
special flavor not found with other growers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. I dare say it did. Still, the real cloud over Chen's life
comes not from burning leaves but from the fiery politics of Maoist
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rarely left our house to play because Mom said there were
many bad people waiting to hurt us. ... When I asked Mom why we had
to hide in our dark house all the time, she said that we were
landlords, and that the people outside were poor peasants who had
taken our house, lands, and stores. They were making us suffer
because the leaders were all bad. There was no fairness, no justice
for us. We had to be quiet, stay out of trouble, and wait for
better days to come. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never supposed to be a leader among other students. I
was born with a political defect that no one could fix.''
</P>
<P>
   And so ``Colors of the Mountain'' is not merely the recollection
of life in a place of harvesting rice by hand and traveling to
other towns by foot or overloaded bicycle. It is a memoir of hunger
for food, acceptance and knowledge, of a time when political
zealotry made it easier for an ex-landlord's son to make friends
among youthful ne'er-do-wells than among the teachers and pupils in
good standing at his village school.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the madness of the Cultural Revolution, intellectual
pursuits became anathema. But after Mao Tse-tung died, the societal
tide turned. A place in college became a consummation devoutly to
be wished, and Chen and his older brother poured themselves into
poring over their books in a fanatical effort to redeem themselves
and their family's sacrifices for them.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's writing style has neither the cant of a revolutionary
(hardly a surprise, given his background) nor the oddly formal
simplicity of Pearl Buck's ``The Good Earth'' or Elizabeth Foreman
Lewis' ``Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze.'' His China comes across as
an odd combination of the alien and the familiar. It is a world of
hardscrabble, primitive peasant life and hard-line,
all-encompassing politics utterly different from suburban America.
On the other hand, the ... um... ``colorful'' conversation of
Chen's youthful compatriots would fit in all too well at any U.S.
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colors of the Mountain'' is neither philosophy nor poetry. It
is a simple tale, bluntly and plainly told, of one youth's desire
to escape the scorched political earth of his home and find a
greener future. &QL;

GORE MOVES SWIFTLY TO MAKE CAMPAIGN FINANCE A PRIORITY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore moved quickly
Wednesday to stake out the high ground on overhauling the campaign
finance system, saying he would make it a campaign priority.
</P>
<P>
   The move is an attempt by Gore both to woo the
soon-to-be-orphaned independent supporters of Sen. John McCain and
former Sen. Bill Bradley, both of whom are expected to leave the
presidential race shortly, and to shield himself on a subject on
which he himself is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who are disaffected and not willing
to be a part of our democracy,'' Gore said Wednesday morning on
CBS. ``We want to reach out and bring them back into the democratic
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been saying relatively kind things about McCain for
days, noting that he agrees with the maverick Republican on the
need to change the campaign finance system and buck big tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   His reiteration Tuesday of his earlier proposal that both
nominees debate twice a week and forego campaign commercials is
aimed, too, at luring independent voters, although that proposal is
popular with a number of voters across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   And his busy travel schedule over the next week _ to Michigan,
Illinois and Pennsylvania, among other places _ indicates he is
aiming for the voters in those big swing states, which may decide
the election. He was headed Wednesday night to Michigan, which
supported McCain in the Republican primary and holds its Democratic
primary March 11.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning Gore acknowledged flat out that he would try
to go after McCain supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I will,'' Gore said on CBS. ``In fact, of the four
candidates who went into the semifinals last night, three of us
support campaign finance reform. And both Senator McCain and
Senator Bradley have spoken eloquently about the need for change in
the way campaigns are conducted. I agree with them very strongly. I
have made a point of it in my campaign as well. And I said in my
speech last evening, we're going to elevate the priority of this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A top Gore strategist said Wednesday that polls indicated that a
plurality of people who voted for McCain on Tuesday, at least in
California, could conceivably vote for Gore in the fall. ``We can't
win a majority of them, but we can win most of them,'' the
strategist said. ``We're obviously going to focus on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the all-but-certain Republican
nominee, has already said he plans to use the 1996 Clinton/Gore
campaign fund-raising excesses and Gore's fund-raiser at a Buddhist
Temple against Gore in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, while campaigning Wednesday afternoon at a diner, where he
ordered a chocolate milkshake, was asked if he would not rather
have voters forget about those events.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, as he shook hands with patrons at the Elliston
Place Soda Shop near Vanderbilt University. ``I want them to
remember what happened in both political parties, and I want them
to look to the future and ask the question, how can we protect our
democracy against undue influence from the kind of secretive,
special-interest, sneak attack'' that Bush deployed against McCain
in the last week?
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain was right to denounce that practice,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp is betting that the battle between McCain and Bush
left some McCain supporters so embittered about Bush to make them
ripe for picking by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with trying to woo McCain voters to the Gore camp is
that McCain is more conservative than Gore on the emotional issues
of abortion and gun control. But oddly, one Gore strategist said, a
number of McCain backers were under the mistaken impression that
the Arizona senator favored abortion rights and gun control, as
Gore does; given that peculiarity, he said, the Gore campaign
intends to try to capture those voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp also expects to use McCain's criticisms about
Bush's tax-cut proposal against Bush. McCain, like Gore, has said
Bush's tax-cut proposal was too big and would put Social Security
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore said Wednesday morning: ``Governor Bush has a plan that
would spend a trillion dollars more than the non-Social Security
surplus. And John McCain has said during this campaign that
Governor Bush's plan would put Social Security at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was still working out the details of some of
the other proposals that Gore made during his speech Tuesday night.
These include his notion to use his campaign to spend time with
average Americans on their jobs, in their homes and at their
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that he feels very comfortable campaigning with
people in a way that gets him in as close and direct contact as
possible, and he believes he learns from people,'' one Gore adviser
said. An aide said that these visits may start in a couple of
weeks.

HOUSTON MAN CONVICTED IN PERROT MEMORABILIA SCAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Texas man was convicted Wednesday of trying to
profit from the plight of cancer-stricken Houston Comet guard Kim
Perrot by soliciting autographed memorabilia for silent auctions
that never took place.
</P>
<P>
   Gene L. Price, 42, of Houston was convicted of one count of
conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and one count of wire
fraud after a two-day trial before U.S. District Judge Vanessa
Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   Co-conspirator Moses Mays Jr., 46, of nearby Missouri City
pleaded guilty last year to his part in the scam.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents began investigating Price and Mays last March, after
National Basketball Association officials became suspicious of a
charitable event the men claimed to be sponsoring to benefit
Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, 32, died Aug. 19 after a seven-month battle with lung
cancer. The point guard helped lead the WNBA Comets to their three
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Mays and Price asked NBA teams for signed jerseys and balls to
be auctioned at a benefit for Perrot.Doing business as Sports
Concepts, the two also sought donations of other items and
services, such as hotel accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   They told several players and NBA teams that they had scheduled
one silent auction for March 19, 1999, at the Westin Galleria Hotel
in Houston, and another a week later at the nearby J.W. Marriott
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The men got signed basketballs or jerseys from the Charlotte
Hornets, Miami Heat, Portland Trail Blazers and Minnesota
Timberwolves, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither auction was held, Mays and Price called NBA
teams to say their items had been sold. They also called other
teams who had not yet sent their promised items, saying Sports
Concepts had to send them to the winning bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Bonifas, manager of media services for the Comets, said
the team called the Women's NBA security office in New York when it
heard about the scam.
</P>
<P>
   Price had a prior criminal record on an unspecified drug
offense, officials said. Gilmore will sentence him June 12. He
faces up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Mays pleaded guilty in November. He was sentenced to 18 months
in prison and three years on supervised release.

FRENCH TROOPS IN KOSOVO SAY PEACEKEEPING LOOKS A LOT LIKE SIEGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA-MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ French peacekeeping troops were
securing their positions with sandbags and barbed wire in the
northern sector of this divided industrial town Wednesday, a day
after 16 of their comrades were wounded in one of its worst
outbreaks yet of ethnic violence. The mood was depressed, and not
least among the peacekeepers, who say they see no way out of the
quagmire of hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The main bridge that connects the Albanian southern part of the
city and the predominantly Serbian northern sector is now a mass of
razor wire. Swedish troops have moved in to guard the Albanian
side, and French troops watch the other. Only U.N. and military
vehicles were crossing Wednesday. No civilians ventured forth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the northern sector, French troops were busy
installing more defenses, filling shoulder-high fortifications with
earth from a mechanical digger and mounting more coils of wire on
top of sand-bagged positions on a street corner. Northern
Kosovska-Mitrovica is rapidly coming to look like a city under
siege.
</P>
<P>
   The French troops were hurt when Albanians hurled grenades at a
group of Serbs gathered close to an Albanian area. Seventeen Serbs
and seven Albanian civilians were also injured. Wednesday the
soldiers on duty in the area appeared sullen. They refused to talk
to the press, or to concede that they were in the area of attacks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the riverbank, where troops have built elaborate
protections around three apartment buildings to protect some 40
Albanians living inside, Serbs have inflicted injuries on the
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hatred here is not aimed at us,'' explained a French
captain on duty. ``We are just caught in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his men were injured when Serbs rioted in protest at the
return of the 40 Albanians, a small percentage of those expelled
from their apartments last month.
</P>
<P>
   But even if not directed at them, the captain observed, the
enmity runs very deep. One of his soldiers had his neck sliced by a
sharpened stone. ``Sharpening stones means there is real hatred,''
the captain said. ``It is too early to bring back Albanians here.
This is not something that can be solved at all quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The troops have surrounded themselves and the apartments with
dozens of armored vehicles and rows and rows of barbed wire. The
soldiers, dressed in full combat gear with body armor and visors on
their helmets, guard the entrance and listen patiently to angry
Serbs who come by to demand that the Albanians be sent away again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extensive defenses, they could not prevent a rocket
attack on one of the apartment buildings Wednesday. Apparently in
retaliation for the grenade attacks and shootings earlier in the
day, someone fired a rocket-propelled grenade, just missing the
window of a seventh-floor apartment. No one was injured, but
residents, both Albanians and Serbs, felt the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian troops guarding the back of the building pointed out the
crater high up on the wall. Moments after the attack, they had to
deal with a crowd of cheering Serbs who gathered to celebrate it.
``These are guys who greet us every day and invite us for a
coffee,'' said the officer in charge. ``And then suddenly they
change into a mob. One guy leads them and they all follow. It is
very nasty _ even in Bosnia I have never seen people like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that French soldiers had investigated the attack and now
knew who had done it, ``down to his name and address.'' But he
criticized the task assigned to his unit to staff stationary
checkpoints and search people and cars going by. ``People begin to
hate us, you see?'' he said, as a Serb made an angry gesture at one
of the soldiers searching his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a reconnaissance unit,'' he said. ``It would be much
better to patrol the town than tie down two dozen men in one place.
Sitting here we cannot stop a rocket attack like that. Better to
patrol and then you can move to the spot when something blows up.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments mirrored the frustrations of the different
peacekeepers at the lack of a clear way out of their situation. The
deputy regional commander of the U.N. police service, John Adams,
also criticized the French military for preventing access to the
scene of the grenade attacks and shootings and to victims Tuesday,
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said that although his police officers had primacy in
criminal investigations, the French had kept them from
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   His reaction gave another sign of the uneasy relations between
French troops and international police officers in the city _ and
of the lack of a convincing effort to beat the violence.  &QL;

CLINTON SENDS LONG-DELAYED BILL ON CHINA TRADE TO WARY CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday sent Congress his
bill to usher China into the World Trade Organization. He then
opened a new front in the debate on the subject in his own party,
arguing that opening up China's markets will undermine Communist
Party control.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the Johns Hopkins foreign affairs graduate school
here, Clinton tried to float above the bitter economic debate in
his party about the wisdom of the deal, and he said little about
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But he made an argument that opening up China's economy amounted
to a poison pill for China's communist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and
cable modem,'' Clinton told a crowd that included students,
lobbyists and many members of Clinton's cabinet, who are now
calling members of Congress daily about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   When China joins the trade organization, the president said, it
will be obliged to make ``the tools of communication even cheaper,
better and more widely available.'' He added: ``We know how much
the Internet has changed America, and we are already and open
society. Imagine how much it could change China.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that since the deal was signed four months
ago, China's leaders have tried to control both what kind of
content Chinese can access via the Internet, and to prevent foreign
ownership of Internet-related companies. But to the Chinese leaders
who are trying to control the Internet in a country as vast and
hard to police as China, he said he had only two words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck!''
</P>
<P>
   The long-delayed transmission of the bill to Congress _ it
appeared timed to arrive after Vice President Gore had the
Democratic presidential nomination firmly in grasp _ set off a
battle within the Democratic Party that intertwines the politics of
trade, the presidential election and Clinton's final effort to
recast relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Only 50 to 60 Democratic members of the House appear prepared to
support the granting of permanent ``normal'' trade status to China.
That is the one legal prerequisite if American companies are to
benefit from the market openings that China promised in 13 years of
negotiation that ended last November.
</P>
<P>
   That means Clinton is dependent on support from House and Senate
Republicans to pass what may be the last major foreign policy
legislation of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He is getting little help from Vice President Gore, who, to
appease labor unions that vociferously oppose the deal, said three
weeks ago that he would negotiate something better if elected to
office. Gore later reiterated his support for the deal the
administration struck, but his aides did not return calls on the
subject Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the presumed Republican nominee,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, said Bush remains a ``vocal
supporter'' of China's entry into the trade organization, because
``it is in our interest, and it is in the interest of the Chinese
to grow an entrepreneurial middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the governor did not yet have a position on tying
passage of the bill to providing new arms for Taiwan, a movement
that several Republicans are considering as the price for their
support.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced Wednesday by Paul Wolfowitz, the dean of
the Paul H. Nitze School for Advanced International Studies, who is
one of Gov. George W. Bush's leading foreign policy advisers. But
Wolfowitz did not mention that Bush has been more vocal in his
support of the bill than Clinton's own vice president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's argument Wednesday that entry to the World Trade
Organization would loosen the hold of China's communist leaders is
bound to set off considerable debate, because it is far from clear
that China's economic openings have been matched by a political
relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made essentially the same argument in 1994 when he
reversed himself, and said that despite his campaign promises he
would no longer link the annual renewal of Chinese trade benefits
to its human rights record. Over time, he said, trade would
contribute to a lifting of political repression.
</P>
<P>
   But in the six years since then, according to the annual reports
published by the State Department, China's rights record has
worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risky argument because it leaves him vulnerable to the
charge that he's overplaying what this agreement will do in
China,'' said Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings
Institution. ``It was a good speech, but there may have been too
much emphasis on what this will do to change China rather than why
it's in the national interests of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton spoke, his advisers foresaw a fierce battle in
Congress, where they are trying to win passage by mid-May, before
the congressional elections heat up. And Wednesday Clinton lost a
major ally: Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., who is influential with his
colleagues on military issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his colleagues, Murtha, who has consistently
voted to renew China's trading rights with the United States, said
he now believes it would be a mistake to lose the leverage of an
annual vote.
</P>
<P>
   He said his mind was made up when China recently threatened
``drastic measures'' and ``the use of force'' against Taiwan if it
was found to be indefinitely delaying reunification talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in our national security interest,'' he concluded,
``to condone and reward grossly irresponsible conduct by a country
that wishes to become a leader in the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has been meeting with members of Congress for
several weeks to press his case, Democratic and Republican leaders
on Capitol Hill have complained that the White House was running
out of time _ and needed to send up a bill. Sen. Daniel P.
Moynihan, D-N.Y., and a supporter of permanent normal trade
relations, a status that most nations enjoy, complained two weeks
ago that the White House was running out of time.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly part of that hesitation was the pressure on Vice
President Gore. But now that he has grasped the nomination, some
White House officials say they hope he will strengthen his support,
even if it means angering unions. ``Where is the AFL-CIO going to
run?'' one cabinet member asked Wednesday. ``To George Bush?''
</P>
<P>
   But the big issue is the Democratic members of Congress, who are
caught between labor, which vows to defeat anyone supporting the
bill, and business interests, which are launching an expensive
advertising campaign supporting it. That effort is led by
agricultural and technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, China is nervous that the bill will fail, and Chinese
officials have already launched an unusual lobbying campaign. One
senior Clinton administration official this week said he feared
that ``China's own efforts could backfire on us big time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton noted Wednesday that even if Congress votes against
normal trade relations, China will still get into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress can only decide whether the United States will share
in the economic benefits,'' Clinton said in his speech. A vote
against the bill, he said, ``will cost America jobs as our
competitors in Europe, Asia and elsewhere capture Chinese markets
that we otherwise would have served.''

TEXAS CANDIDATE MAKES CAMPAIGN ISSUE OF O.J. SIMPSON'S ACQUITTAL 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's a campaign ploy that might be more at home in Los
Angeles, but this is the Harris County district attorney's race.
</P>
<P>
   Over a photo of O.J. Simpson playing golf, local candidate
Michael Stafford takes his own swing in a new brochure mailed to
Republican primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exclusive!'' the ad says. ``If Michael Stafford had been the
DA, O.J. would be busting rocks, not hitting balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Black community leaders criticized the brochure, mailed to
80,000 voters for Tuesday's primary, as exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you do what you have to do when you are an
ultraconservative,'' said Deloyd Parker, director of the SHAPE
Community Center. ``If nothing else, it's a blink of the eye from
racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Stafford, first assistant Harris County attorney and one of five
GOP candidates vying for the seat, said he ``never considered'' the
ad could be racially divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he is someone rich enough and famous enough to use the
kind of evidence and expertise that the DA's office in Los Angeles
didn't have access to,'' Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County, which includes most of Houston, has 3.2 million
people and is the largest county in Texas. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Simpson, a former football star and broadcaster, was acquitted
of the 1994 slashing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson,
and Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   A civil jury later found him liable for the deaths and ordered
him to pay $33.5 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The verdicts divided public opinion. A CNN poll after the
criminal trial found 73 percent of Anglos believed Simpson murdered
his ex-wife, compared with 27 percent of blacks who thought so.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford's mailing also drew criticism from within his own
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think prosecutions in California have anything to do
with the race in Harris County,'' said Gary Polland, chairman of
the Harris County Republican Party. ``I don't know why it's been
injected into our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston radio personality and community activist Ada Edwards
questioned the relevance of invoking Simpson's image in a local
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's too bad the race has become about who is the
baddest guy on the block,'' Edwards said. ``To highlight this in an
ad is ludicrous and insulting to the whole community, black, white,
man and woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker also noted the unintended irony of a law-and-order
candidate criticizing the same criminal justice system he is
working so hard to be a part of.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford, who once worked as a chemist for Atlantic Richfield
Co., makes the point in his campaign that he is familiar and
comfortable with new scientific methods being used in criminal
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Simpson ad is relevant because under his watch, the
botched evidence and other foibles of the Simpson trial would not
happen here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DA's office should be one that stays up with the
technology because it's changing all the time,'' Stafford said.
``The Simpson case went bad because the prosecutors didn't have the
kind of expertise they needed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rice University political scientist and pollster Bob Stein said
the ad is probably Stafford's last big shot at building his name
with voters before Tuesday's primary election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is playing to rather a base emotional concern, in my
opinion,'' Stein said. ``In the Republican primary, of course,
there aren't going to be a lot of black voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican contenders for the race are Jim Leitner, a
defense attorney; prosecutor Chuck Rosenthal; Patricia Lykos, a
former criminal district judge; and Lloyd Kelley, former city
controller.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Simpson criminal trial, meanwhile, has had lasting political
implications in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Garcetti, the district attorney at the time of Simpson's
trial, faces a runoff election to keep his seat after Tuesday's
California primary, a political uncertainty some have attributed to
public anger over Simpson's acquittal in 1996.

NOMINATION THE ONLY THING DIRECTORS HAVE IN COMMON
</HEADLINE>
 DIRECTOR-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Film directors can be judged on so many levels, it's a wonder
there's not more division over the Best Director race at the
Oscars. A good director finds the proper tone for a screenplay,
then _ with the cast and crew _ tries to bring it to fruition
through a variety of means: color scheme, musical score, art
direction, cinematography choices (including film stock), editing
pace and, of course, acting. Naturally, those elements vary from
movie to movie.
</P>
<P>
   A good director knows how to use the tools; for instance, he or
she can make a limited actor look better simply by accentuating
strengths and playing down weaknesses. A good director can
manipulate an audience without making the audience feel manipulated
_ or at least without making the audience resent being manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees in this year's Best Director race have such varied
styles that it's almost bizarre that they're nominated for the same
award. The person who did the best job of manipulating an audience,
though, was M. Night Shyamalan, who not only managed to make his
ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' moody, creepy and forgivably
sentimental but surprised us with a plot twist so treasured that
audiences actually guarded it; even some people who recently saw
the movie say they're stunned that nobody spoiled it for them.
</P>
<P>
   Shyamalan worked from his own screenplay and got earnest
performances out of Bruce Willis and especially young actor (and
fellow Oscar nominee) Haley Joel Osment. ``The Sixth Sense'' is a
quantum leap from Shyamalan's first movie, the trite religious
drama ``Wide Awake,'' but that earnestness also works against him.
``The Sixth Sense'' made tons of money, but it's often slow and
takes itself very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   You can't say that about Sam Mendes' ``American Beauty,'' which
explores suburban dysfunction with a sardonic zing. Mendes brought
the bitter humor of Alan Ball's screenplay to life and drenched the
movie in bright colors that made the characters' lives look
appealing even though every character is a mess. Although Mendes
had great raw material to work with _ Kevin Spacey is close to
perfect as midlife-crisis poster boy Lester Burnham _ his
theatrical background sometimes showed through: Some of the
dialogue scenes reach a shrill, forced pitch that detracts from the
subtler moments.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes and Shyamalan look like the front-runners in this year's
Best Director race, but I feel a personal affection for Spike
Jonze, a guy who did some pretty cool music videos (notably the
Beastie Boys' ``Sabotage'' and Fatboy Slim's ``Praise You'') before
coming out with one of the year's most enjoyably weird movies,
``Being John Malkovich.'' Like Mendes, Jonze worked from a strong
screenplay (by Charlie Kaufman) but gave this surreal examination
of celebrity culture his own spin. He may be the only person who
could have perfectly executed a scene in which character actor
Malkovich goes inside his own head. But like Mendes, Jonze
sometimes lets his actors get too shrill, and he almost derails the
movie's goodwill during scenes in which obsessed puppeteer John
Cusack imprisons his not-so-passive-anymore wife (Cameron Diaz).
</P>
<P>
   Jonze probably doesn't stand a chance for the Oscar; his movie
is just too oddball, and it missed out on a Best Picture
nomination. It also seems unlikely that Lasse Hallstrom, who
directed the novelesque ``The Cider House Rules,'' will grab the
statue (especially when you consider that Hallstrom didn't receive
a Directors Guild of America nomination; the DGA winner, who will
be announced March 11, usually takes home the Oscar).
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mann, a director much-admired by his peers, stands an
outside chance at winning for the social drama ``The Insider.'' But
the movie didn't have the box-office clout of ``The Sixth Sense''
or ``American Beauty'' and isn't getting a pre-Oscar push like
those movies are.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: ``American Beauty's'' renewed box-office presence
helps Mendes snag a win; but don't be surprised if ``The Sixth
Sense'' upsets it for Best Picture.
</P>
<P>
   Personal pick: Jonze's ``Being John Malkovich'' was just too
funny, weird and innovative to be ignored.

`BATTLE-TESTED' BUSH SETS SIGHTS ON GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Story has been updated) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Proclaiming himself ``battle-tested'' by the GOP
primary process, Gov. George W. Bush on Wednesday said the nation
will soon see the ``stark differences'' between himself and Vice
President Al Gore, the leading Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, claiming that his Super Tuesday election victories in nine
states put the Republican nomination within his grasp, said he's
not ready to dismiss the faltering challenge of Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   But sources in the McCain campaign said late Wednesday that the
senator would likely withdraw from the race Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, one day after key losses in Super Tuesday primaries had
all but killed his chances for the Republican presidential
nomination, had retreated early Wednesday to his vacation home in
Cottonwood, Ariz., to reassess his political future.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, McCain's political director, dismissed speculation
that McCain _ who has demonstrated strong appeal to independent and
Democratic voters with his maverick, reform-oriented campaign _
would launch a third-party bid for the White House. But he declined
to rule out that option, despite McCain's earlier insistence that
he will remain in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain beat Bush in four states, Bush captured the vast
majority of delegates to the Republican National Convention; the
upcoming primaries, including Texas and Florida, will likely give
Bush the 1,034 delegates he needs to guarantee the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   To wrap up his quest, Bush on Thursday travels to Colorado,
Wyoming and Utah, all of which have primaries Friday. This weekend,
Bush ventures to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging news conference outside the Governor's
Mansion, Bush urged Texans to participate in next week's primaries,
even if he is assured of the nomination. His comments came after he
cast his own Texas GOP primary ballot for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't tell people who I vote for, but I voted for
myself,'' the governor said. Turning to his wife, Laura, he asked,
``How about you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for you,'' she assured him.
</P>
<P>
   Until he has the nomination secured, or until McCain abandons
his candidacy, Bush said he'll take nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the appropriate time, I want to talk to John (McCain) if he
wants to. And, of course, I'm going to be reaching out to the
people he energized for the primary,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who$:X.H15en!%Q%9

<P>
   Magic was in the air as Bill Bradley returned to his hometown
last September. Pundits and pollsters swooned, Vice President Al
Gore's campaign was in disarray, and Bradley launched his own
presidential race with a speech as lofty as his plays as a high
school basketball star in that very same gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, Bradley crashed back to earth. As one looks
back to understand the collapse of his presidential bid, perhaps
the most telling moment came not during Bradley's thoughtful speech
that day in Crystal City, Mo., but rather in his encounter with
Rita Thuesen.
</P>
<P>
   Thuesen, a slim brown-haired woman who was Bradley's
second-grade music teacher, went before the television cameras to
describe the seed of a president in her old runny-nosed pupil.
Then, as the crowd brimmed with emotion, she walked over to where
Bradley and his wife, Ernestine, were sitting. If ever in the
history of politics there was a hugging time, this was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped in front of them and told Ernestine that I hoped she
would be dancing with Bill in the White House,'' Thuesen recalled.
``And Bill just sat and looked at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bradley's wife prodded him and he gave his teacher
an awkward hug. But that emotional reserve, that profound
detachment _ even shyness _ never left him, and his campaign
faltered in part because he often failed to establish an emotional
bond with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will appear with his wife on Thursday in West Orange,
N.J. to announce the inevitable _ that he is giving up a campaign
that began with such promise, only to end without achieving a
single primary victory.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of how Bradley's campaign collapsed underscores a few
lessons about American politics today.
</P>
<P>
   First, as George W. Bush must be noticing, a sitting vice
president with strong party backing is a formidable competitor and
enjoys a huge advantage when the American economy is purring along
in its longest expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   Second, voters may be angered by negative campaigning, but it
works. In the fall, analysts bet that voters would be turned off by
smarmy politicians fighting like wolverines, but in the end the
public also seemed to want a candidate tough enough to defend
himself. Bradley's attempt to run a high-brow, high-minded campaign
sometimes conveyed wimpiness, and one lesson may be that positive
campaigners get torn apart by those wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   Third, in Democratic primaries, traditional constituencies like
labor unions and members of minority groups still matter
enormously. In retrospect, one of the death blows to Bradley's
campaign came just as it seemed to be taking off. The first
primary, in a sense, came back in October when the AFL-CIO endorsed
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, though, Bradley was still rising in the polls,
staying even with Gore in raising funds and attracting admiring
publicity from the news media. Bradley inspired some people with
the impression that he was above politics, running less as a 21st
century politician than as an Old Testament prophet, and he
deliberately packaged himself as the package-less candidate,
wearing scruffy suits and disdaining the hurly-burly of political
attacks and counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley set the tone at the first of his debates with Gore, in
Bedford, N.H., in October. A woman asked Bradley to comment ``on
the behavior of the '96 Clinton-Gore campaign as it relates to fund
raising.'' Rarely has such a lob been pitched to a candidate, but
Bradley refused to swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were obviously some irregularities that have
been addressed,'' Bradley said mildly, and he then noted that both
candidates agree on some ideas to improve the campaign finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   Why the reluctance of Bradley to employ his best weapon,
indignation at Gore's aggressive fund-raising?
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an ongoing discussion in the campaign in early
October about the level of response and how much the candidate
should be involved in the negativity,'' recalled one of Bradley's
top advisers. The conclusion was that Bradley should stay above the
fray, apparently for two reasons. The first was tactical, that
Bradley would sully his appeal if he engaged in typical political
brawls, and that commentators and journalists would keep the issue
alive instead. The second was an apparently genuine distaste on
Bradley's part for attack politics and a feeling that it was
beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   The high-mindedness appealed to many Democrats who were sick of
conventional politics. But it also left a huge opening for Gore,
who throughout his career has been gentlemanly when possible and a
street fighter when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Delicately at first, Gore began taking jabs at Bradley. The vice
president warned that Bradley's health care plan _ an ambitious
proposal that aimed to help the poor and members of minority groups
_ was too ambitious and would cost too much. Bradley did not hit
back.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-November, Gore raised the stakes. It was a sunny day in
Pasadena, Calif., and Gore was fiery as he stood in his
shirt-sleeves and offered a different critique of his rival's
health plan. The vice president told a gathering sponsored by an
African-American group that Bradley was trying to ``dismantle
Medicaid'' in ways that would hurt blacks, Latinos and the poor.

 Intel Ships Fast Chip, Catches Up With AMD  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Driven by their intensifying competition for bragging rights in PC
processor speed, both Intel and Advanced Micro Devices this week
began shipping 1-gigahertz chips, well ahead of their previously
announced schedules.
<P>
   But PCs with the new chips will be scarce and expensive for
weeks and even months to come, and it may be even longer before the
average user sees any compelling benefit from them.
</P>
<P>
   A gigahertz is 1,000 megahertz, or 1 billion cycles per second.
The more cycles per second, the faster a microprocessor can chew
through its assigned tasks. The actual speed users experience on
real-life tasks, however, depends on a variety of factors,
including other aspects of a chip's design, the performance of
other PC components and, increasingly, the speed of the machine's
Internet connection _ not to mention the user's typing and thinking
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, which until recently had said its gigahertz processor would
ship after midyear, said on Monday that it is already shipping.
According to several industry sources, the company changed the date
of its announcement twice last week to make sure it would beat
Intel to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   That effort succeeded, but only by two days: Intel unveiled its
gigahertz Pentium III yesterday. Only a month ago, the company
declared that it would deliver such a chip this fall. But that was
before AMD garnered headlines worldwide by demonstrating an Athlon
running at 1.1 gigahertz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies have stretched to hit these speeds,'' said
Michael Slater, founder and executive editor of Microprocessor
Report, an influential industry newsletter. ``It's mostly a matter
of positioning between them.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD, which in the past has seriously challenged Intel only at
the low end of the market, is now ``determined to show that it's
leading the race,'' he said, while ``Intel very much wants to keep
them out of that position.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes, however, include profits as well as prestige,
because the fastest chips available traditionally command much
higher prices than ordinary PC processors. Since the actual cost of
producing the fastest chips is usually no higher, the difference in
price goes straight to the chipmaker's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's gigahertz Pentium III, for example, sells for $990 in
quantities of 1,000, while the same chip running at 800 megahertz
lists for $647, and a 500-megahertz version is only $193. AMD's
1-GHz Athlon is priced, for now, at $1,299; 950- and 900-MHz
versions, also announced this week, are $999 and $899,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either company expects to ship these chips in
high volume at this point,'' Slater said. ``The prices they've set
ensure that that'll be the case,'' he added, because they force
PC-makers to price systems above mainstream market levels.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Compaq and Gateway, the first two companies to
announce gigahertz Athlon PCs, are charging $2,499 and $2,999,
respectively. Machines with the new Pentium III are even higher:
Hewlett-Packard's Pavilion 1G PC is $3,499, and IBM's Aptiva S 1GZ
is $3,348. Dell's gigahertz Pentium III model, dubbed the Dimension
Special Edition, takes the cake with an even more special price:
$5,999.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, buyers will get a lot of bang for all those bucks:
In addition to ultrafast processors, these systems come with 128
(or, in Dell's case, 256) megabytes of RAM, 30- or 40-gigabyte hard
drives, the hottest 3-D graphics accelerators, 17- or 19-inch
monitors and a host of other bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Intel and AMD tout the benefits of their new processors to
``digital content creators'' _ graphic designers and video editors,
for example _ and to scientists and engineers running demanding
technical applications. But both companies, as well as the PC
manufacturers, acknowledge that for now most buyers will likely be
affluent PC enthusiasts and gamers.
</P>
<P>
   Slater, however, said even these users would see only modest
speed-up compared to the performance already delivered by much less
expensive systems with slightly slower processors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time, once there's a substantial installed base of PCs with
processors like these, they will change the nature of the
applications people write,'' he said, citing the possibility of
improved speech-recognition software and 3-D interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's always a considerable time lag _ for now even the
number of games that really take advantage of these processors is
pretty limited,'' he said. ``People who buy in now will pay a
substantial premium, and by the time the applications are
available, the systems will be much cheaper.''

 UNDATED: the poor.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Any plan that tears down Medicaid leaves African-Americans and
Latinos out in the cold,'' Gore declared. He added: ``I would call
on Senator Bradley to reconsider a program that has such a harsh
impact on low-income and working families in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and his aides were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for them to say Bill Bradley will push disabled
people out of their wheelchairs,'' fumed Anita Dunn, Bradley's
communications director. (Sure enough, Gore did eventually assert
that the Bradley plan would hurt the disabled.)
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Bradley was steaming. But the campaign simply
released a measured statement accusing Gore of ``scare tactics and
divisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, for the Gore campaign, was that Bradley would not
hit back. And so in the coming weeks, Gore began battering Bradley
from every direction.
</P>
<P>
   An underlying problem was that Bradley was not terribly good at
taking advice. In contrast to President Ronald Reagan, who
recruited first-rate campaign advisers and happily stood on the
spot they marked for him to get the best television angle, Bradley
attracted advisers who were as scornful of political games as he
was. And while he listened to suggestions, Bradley acted in effect
as his own campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``His advisers reinforced Bill's worst tendencies,'' grumbled
one aide, who asked not to be named but who, like others, now
believes that bad campaign strategy helped sink their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior aide said of the inner circle: ``These people
were always concerned about what their relationship with Bill would
be, as opposed to just doing what it takes to win. It should have
been, `I don't care what you think of me, I want to win.'''
</P>
<P>
   As the 2000 campaign unfolded, there came to be growing doubts
that Bradley had what it took to win _ especially the ruthlessness
and the furious, uncompromising, tenacious lust for power.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore slamming blow after blow at Bradley, and often
distorting his positions, many of Bradley's field organizers were
eager to fight back. But the candidate and his high command _ all
of whom believed that they needed to take the high road _ kept
reigning them in.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bradley's state director, Mark Longabaugh, was
seething with frustration as he watched Gore attack Bradley's
health care plan as both too costly and also inadequate. One day,
when Gore visited a series of New Hampshire pharmacies to attack
Bradley's health plan, Longabaugh had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Using his desktop computer, Longabaugh created a satire of a
prescription form that caustically mocked the vice president. The
form prescribed medicine for ``Gore-itis,'' whose symptoms include
``uncontrollable lying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a healthy dose daily, especially when talking about the
Bill Bradley health plan,'' the sheet said. ``Failure to do so may
result in uncontrollable negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast to Bradley's muted response to attacks, the
vice president personally complained about the flyer. He accused
the Bradley forces of campaigning by ``personal invective.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Bradley aides were appalled by the flyer and feared that
it would conflict with his positive message. So they ordered
Longabaugh to apologize, and Bradley's campaign chairman, Douglas
C. Berman, issued an apology of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This flyer is not characteristic of Bill Bradley nor the style
in which he has run this campaign,'' Berman said in a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The retraction was barely noticed at the time. But within both
campaigns it became a symbol of how easy it was for the Gore
campaign to shove Bradley without getting pushed back.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bradley's mistakes, apparently unchallenged by his close
aides, was the decision to devote huge resources to the Iowa
caucuses. The caucuses have always treated insurgents poorly, and
Gore had a huge advantage because of his AFL-CIO endorsement and
the resulting wave of labor organizers working for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley spent much of January campaigning in Iowa, and he
spent $2 million on commercials there. It became evident very
quickly that the strategy was not working, but Bradley's campaign
then underscored another of its fundamental weaknesses:
inflexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of changing plans and skipping Iowa, as John McCain did
on the Republican side, Bradley slogged on. It was an approach that
friends say had carried him through life. Each time he got in
trouble, he buckled down and worked harder. That technique rescued
him when he first arrived at Princeton University and found himself
at sea academically, and it worked again when he first joined the
New York Knicks basketball team and initially played poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his own view of how things were going to go, and I'd
never seen him so confident as at the start,'' recalled an old
friend. ``He was so high on his expectations, and then he didn't
act well when a couple of things went wrong. As a young man, he had
a tendency to get moody when his performance wasn't perfect. In his
early career in the pro's, he was like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moodiness plays even worse in politics than in basketball,
however. And his old techniques of improving himself no longer
worked. After losing a game, Bradley would go out the next morning
and drill with a ferocious discipline, sinking 25 baskets in a row
first from one place on the court, then another and so on.

 Chevron, Oracle, Wal-Mart Team Up to Provide Online Exchange
For  Shops 
 &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bay Area business giants Chevron and Oracle yesterday teamed up
with Wal-Mart subsidiary McLane Co. to create an Internet exchange
where convenience stores can order merchandise, manage inventory
and analyze sales patterns.
<P>
   RetailersMarketXchange.com, which should be up and running in
about three months, will automate and centralize a range of
operations for chain stores as well as stand-alone convenience
shops, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Such online exchanges are becoming de rigueur in the
business-to-business arena, in which the Web is seen as a way to
purchase goods and disseminate information more efficiently and
cost effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, which makes database software for high-powered corporate
networks, recently announced similar supply-chain portals with auto
manufacturer Ford and retailer Sears, and the Redwood Shores
company said more are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Using a standard PC and Internet browser _ already present in
the back office of 90 percent of U.S. convenience stores, the
companies say _ shop managers will be able to log onto
RetailersMarketXchange to purchase Twinkies and soda, check on the
store's supply of Visine, and break down sales of potato chips
month by month.
</P>
<P>
   Stores will also be able to manage accounting and human resource
data and download the latest corporate training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, Oracle and McLane _ which each have a minority stake in
RetailersMarketXchange _ say the venture will streamline operations
and cut costs, both for businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only will this lower cost for the consumers, but
inventories will be lower, food will be fresher, and things will
run smoother,'' Oracle Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle will bring its Oracle Exchange software suite to the
deal. Chevron will bring about 8,000 convenience stores _ or about
5 percent of the convenience store market nationwide. And McLane
will contribute its distribution expertise and ties to both
retailers and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   McLane of Temple, Texas, supplies food and other items to about
30,000 convenience stores in the United States including 7-Eleven
outlets and Texaco Star Marts.
</P>
<P>
   Although no other convenience store operators aside from San
Francisco's Chevron have signed on the dotted line, McLane
officials say other chains will be eager to join. They also believe
suppliers, like Philip Morris and Procter &AMP; Gamble, will join the
exchange to gain access to smaller chains or individual stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the world's first global exchange for the $200 billion
convenience and small store retailing market,'' said Chevron Chief
Executive Officer Dave O'Reilly. ``The big benefit here is to
leverage the Internet to create an efficient purchasing and
communications exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the venture could face some roadblocks from small
stores, which may not be tuned in to the Internet revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, there might be some issues with mom-and-pop
stores,'' said Aberdeen Group senior analyst Lara Abrams. ``For
them, there's a tremendous education process that needs to be
undertaken.''
</P>
<P>
   RetailersMarketXchange plans to make money through advertising,
software licenses and by taking a piece of each sales transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Lisa Williams at Boston's Yankee Group research firm
said the exchange could potentially save corporations money in two
ways. First, by more efficiently controlling inventory, stores
won't pay for merchandise they don't sell.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, it creates ``a technology co-op,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of (each store or chain) buying their own piece of
procurement software, they have a shared infrastructure called a
marketplace where the entry costs of browsing are very low.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional companies are drawn to the online exchanges for
other reasons, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do they get the technology and the business
efficiency. They get to participate in the dot-com economy through
the creation of a dot-com marketplace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron stock edged up 6 cents yesterday, closing at $81.06.
Yesterday's news had a larger impact on Oracle stock, which rose
$8.19 _ almost 11 percent _ closing at $83.13.

 UNDATED: so on.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Iowa, however, practice did not make perfect. And meanwhile
Gore was proving far more flexible a campaigner than anyone had
imagined. Terrified by Bradley's successes in fund-raising and
gaining media attention, Gore revamped his campaign, honed his
message and became a far more dynamic campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   The two armies had a decisive clash in Iowa at a debate Jan. 9,
where Gore used a remarkably effective technique: He called on a
farmer in the audience, Chris Peterson, asked him to stand up, and
then asked Bradley, ``Why did you vote against the disaster relief
for Chris Peterson when he and thousands of other farmers here in
Iowa needed it after those '93 floods?''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was deeply unfair, because Bradley had in fact voted
in favor of the flood assistance. He had voted against an amendment
for additional aid, but the Clinton administration had also opposed
that amendment until the last minute. Instead of pointing this out,
Bradley tried to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Bradley _ after rapturous initial coverage in the
press _ began to be portrayed in print and on the airwaves as
remote, out of touch and even arrogant and gruff. While other
candidates went out of their way to win the hearts and minds of
journalists, complimenting them on their questions with such
conviction that one might almost think they were sincere, Bradley
often greeted tough questions with scorn. And he seemed to think he
could manage the news, even though it regularly upended him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had never disclosed that for the past few years he had
suffered an irregular heart beat, a common condition known as
atrial fibrillation. Aides said he planned to release full medical
information in January. But his heart interfered with that timing:
He had to check into a hospital in December when his heart began
thumping out of beat, and so the news poured out in a deluge that
made him seem both feeble and secretive.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gore won Iowa, 63 percent to 35 percent. It was not
particularly discreditable in a state like Iowa, but it came across
as a major defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bradley found himself with another problem:
the far more glamorous candidacy of John McCain. In what is now
seen as a major error, Bradley had met with McCain in a joint
appearance to demand campaign finance reform, giving McCain
credibility at a time few were paying any attention to him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley were both running as insurgents against the
political system, and both were running in part on biography.
Bradley's Hall-of-Fame background had seemed about as amazing a
past as a politician could have, but McCain was the one candidate
who could trump him in that category.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, with its open primary, voters became excited
by McCain in a way that they did not with Bradley. Not only did
McCain siphon off votes of independents from Bradley, he also
siphoned away media attention. There might have been room for one
rebel with a great biography in the campaign, but there was not
room for two _ especially when the second sometimes had trouble
working a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of the New Hampshire primary, Bradley addressed a
raucous crowd of several hundred volunteers in a college gymnasium.
The supporters repeatedly interrupted Bradley to cheer and chant
their support, but each time he sternly waved his hands to hush
them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Sheila Wellstone, wife of Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.,
tried to sustain that enthusiasm by doing an end run around
Bradley. Each time Bradley motioned for the crowd to be quiet, she
would raise her hands to urge fans to keep the applause coming.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bradley lost the New Hampshire primary by 4
percentage points. Labor unions _ which had vigorously campaigned
for Gore _ provided the vice president with the margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley had floated above politics, and he thought he could
float above the campaign,'' said Fred Siegel, a professor of
history at the Cooper Union for Arts and Sciences. ``Suppose
Bradley had come back quickly and suppose he had run campaign ads
with shots of the Buddhist temple'' _ a reminder of the illegal
campaign contributions raised when Gore visited with Chinese
Buddhists in California. ``He could have won New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's performance was still impressive for an outsider,
better than Eugene McCarthy's in 1968 that forced President Lyndon
B. Johnson to quit the race. But whereas Bill Clinton managed to
lose New Hampshire in 1992 and ``spin'' it as a victory,
proclaiming himself ``the come-back kid,'' Bradley was simply cast
as the loser.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the news the next day _ and in the next few
weeks _ was not about Bradley but about McCain's amazing 19-point
win in New Hampshire and his challenge to Bush. The Democratic race
had a five-week lull after New Hampshire, and so all attention
turned to the vicious battle on the Republican side. Bradley
vanished from the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign wore on, Bradley abandoned his focus on the
positive and began blasting Gore for distorting Bradley's record as
well as his own. But while Gore could knife an opponent with
warmth, grace and apparent reluctance, the newly negative Bradley
came across as petulant and strident, and his shift from one
extreme to the other seemed to be a case of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he felt things slipping away slightly, he did things like
going negative,'' recalls an old friend. ``But when he heard the
words he was saying and saw himself on TV doing this, I think he
got depressed. He hated himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The few photographers left covering Bradley became frustrated
that their standard photos _ Bradley waving exultantly to a crowd,
or shaking hands with a beaming supporter _ never saw light of
print. One photographer said that he found that the best way to get
newspapers to use his pictures was to transmit shots showing
Bradley looking alone or dejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want the rah-rah shots any more,'' the
photographer said. ``I realized I had to start sending shots that
reflected the tone of the stories, which was negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, perhaps the most memorable photo of the Bradley campaign
_ taken by a different photographer _ was a haunting shot of the
candidate on a ferry in Washington state, surrounded by commuters
but standing alone in his own world, gripping a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the collapse of Bradley's campaign obscures
its accomplishments. Bradley contributed mightily to setting the
Democratic agenda by pressing Gore to talk more than he had planned
about health care, poverty, race relations, gay rights and gun
control. Bradley also mounted an unusually potent challenge against
a sitting vice president in a time of economic plenty, briefly
shaking the foundations of the Democratic establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, Bradley never managed to attract core
constituencies. Labor remained behind Gore, and so did most black
voters, in both cases repaying a sense of loyalty to the Clinton
administration. And unlike Gore, who over the course of the
campaign turned from wooden to flesh as surely as Pinnocchio in the
movie, Bradley never lost his reserve and rarely linked at an
emotional level with voters.

   In Tacoma, Wash., a few weeks ago, Bradley spoke to a group of
children and began interviewing them, eliciting vivid tales of
seeing people shot with guns. It was wrenching to listen to, but
when they finished Bradley simply nodded, turned away and returned
to his dry speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's oldest friends in Crystal City are saddened by this
inability to connect with voters, but not particularly surprised.
They describe him as a mix of his parents: Susan, vivacious and
fun, is reflected in the humor and warmth that he shows among small
groups of people, and Warren, the reserved, Victorian gentleman,
emerges in more formal settings such as a larger audience or a
television appearance.

   ``This is how he was raised,'' said Carol Cunningham, Bradley's
next-door neighbor in childhood. ``Years of conditioning would make
it very hard for him to change.

   ``Hugging your second-grade teacher? You've got to understand
how we were raised. She's a person of respect. You wouldn't hug
her. She's still Mrs. Thuesen.''

 Northpoint, Cisco Establish Joint Venture in Europe  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Cisco Systems and Northpoint Communications, two Bay area Internet
infrastructure firms, both launched major joint ventures in Europe
yesterday to expand their sales overseas.
<P>
   Cisco, the world's largest seller of data networking equipment,
announced plans to pump $835 million into a new company formed with
Cap Gemini Group, a technology consulting group in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Cisco said it will buy $671 million in Cap Gemini
stock and pour another $164 million directly into the new Cap
Gemini subsidiary, which will target European phone companies and
Internet service providers. Cisco will control 4.9 percent of the
new unit, which has yet to be named, and Cap Gemini will control
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Cap Gemini also said it plans to move 4,600 employees into the
new division, while Cisco will assign 50 to 100 employees to help
the venture with projects.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the investment, Cisco said Cap Gemini promised
to recommend Cisco's routers and other networking equipment to its
clients, something Cisco called a ``loyalty agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The move mirrors another Cisco joint venture with the Big Five
accounting firm KPMG. Cisco took a $1 billion stake, or 20 percent,
in the consulting arm of KPMG two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Volpi, Cisco's senior vice president of business
development, said such pacts are notable because ``one of the
traditions of (consultancies) is to be vendor-neutral.'' But he
said Cisco has such a large range of products and dominance in the
data networking market that customers do not normally object.
</P>
<P>
   The latest venture could also help boost Cisco's sales in
Europe. Cisco executive Bill Nuti told Bloomberg News that Europe
is expected to be Cisco's fastest-growing market, bringing in $10
billion in annual revenue within three years. European sales jumped
50 percent last year, trailing only Asia, Bloomberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco shares rose 31 cents, to $132.38, yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Northpoint, the fast-growing San Francisco firm,
which provides high-speed Internet access over conventional phone
lines using DSL, or digital subscriber lines, teamed up with a
Dutch telecommunications firm to offer the service across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Both Northpoint and VersaTel Telecom International plan to pour
$50 million into the new venture, dubbed Versapoint. Northpoint's
chief executive and co-founder, Michael Malaga, 35, is stepping
down to run Versapoint, though he will remain Northpoint's
chairman. Chief Operating Officer Liz Fetter, who joined Northpoint
from US West in 1997, will take over as CEO. Previously, she worked
for Pacific Bell and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European market is just hungry for Internet access,''
Fetter said. Northpoint, which boosted sales from under $1 million
in 1998 to $21 million in 1999, expects to see similar growth in
Europe. Versapoint will start out with less than $1 million in
sales. It expects to have 500 to 1,000 workers in 18 months. By
comparison, Northpoint has about 1,000 workers, up from about 200
in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Versapoint will initially roll out DSL service to businesses in
Germany and the Netherlands, begin testing service in the United
Kingdom and France and soon expand to other industrial nations,
like Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Northpoint shares jumped $4.38, to $29.88, on the news.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the end, it looked as if opponents of the two
most controversial, closely watched initiatives on the state ballot
never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Californians overwhelmingly approved a ban on the recognition of
same-sex marriages, as well as a laundry list of laws that stiffen
penalties for adolescent offenders and make it easier to try youths
as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a steady drop in crime in the last 10 years Proposition
21, the latest in a long line of voter-approved tough-on-crime
measures in California, passed by 62 percent to 38 percent. The
limits on marriage initiative, or Proposition 22, which states that
``only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in
California,'' passed by almost the same margin, 61.4 percent to
38.6 percent. Both measures had broad support from men and women
and all races and income levels.
</P>
<P>
   Belying California's reputation as a liberal state, only a
handful of counties, all in the San Francisco Bay area, voted
against the two measures. San Franciscans opposed the propositions
by the widest margin in the state _ 60 percent against the crime
initiative and 69 percent against the ban on recognizing same sex
unions.
</P>
<P>
   For proponents of Proposition 22, the vote proved that
Californians are wedded to traditional family values. The juvenile
crime initiative follows a trend in voter-based measures in
California to increase punishment for those who commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, a measure was passed expanding the death penalty. In
1982, a ballot initiative broadened prosecution evidence and
narrowed the insanity defense. In 1990, an initiative gave
prosecutors access to pretrial evidence and curtailed defendants'
rights at preliminary hearings. Most famously, in 1994, voters
approved the ``three strikes'' law which made third felony
convictions subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 25
years-to-life.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the trend on Tuesday, voters approved two other crime
initiatives: Proposition 18, which extends the death penalty to
arson and kidnapping cases and Proposition 19, which increases the
penalty for second-degree murder to life in prison if the victim is
a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer or California State
University peace officer.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who made tough-on-crime
laws the fulcrum of his administration during two terms in office
ending in 1999, said the juvenile crime measure ``will retake
California neighborhoods, schools and businesses from vicious
street gangs who for too long have hidden behind a lenient and
outdated juvenile justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the ban on recognition of gay and lesbian unions, 30
states have passed similar initiatives. State Sen. William J.
Knight, a conservative Republican from the desert town of Palmdale
and the author of Proposition 22, said that the overwhelming
support for the ban, even though same-sex unions are not legal
anywhere in the nation, is proof that ``California is not ready for
a marriage between a man and a man.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of Propositions 21 and 22 said that for many
voters, the real impact of the ballot measures had not been made
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to the juvenile crime initiative said it would
cost billions of dollars to implement, while failing to budget a
single dollar for for prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This initiative is going to push thousands of nonviolent
offenders into the criminal justice system at the age of 14,'' said
Kim Mayoshi, a spokeswoman for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The crime initiative represents the most significant overhaul of
the juvenile justice system since it was created a century ago.
Among other changes, it requires convicted gang members to register
with the police, transfers the power to decide whether a youth is
to be tried as an adult from a judge to a prosecutor, and allows
courts to sentence youths convicted of murder to life in prison
without parole. It also toughens penalties for less serious crimes
like vandalism, lowering the amount of damage for a felony charge
to $400 from $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22 was the most contentious of the state's 20 ballot
initiatives, which also included an initiative to limit campaign
donations that voters rejected, and a major expansion of casino
gambling on Indian reservations that was resoundingly approved.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of Proposition 22 said it closed a loophole in
California law that would have allowed gay and lesbians who, in the
future, might be legally married elsewhere to come into the state
and demand to be counted as a wedded couple.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said that courts in states where similar initiatives
have passed have used the law to limit legal protections for gay
and lesbian families.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer C. Pizer, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund Inc, said: ``Now that the measure has been passed,
will its backers make a meaningful commitment to support essential
legal protections for lesbians and gay men?''

BOURQUE SPEAKS OF BRUINS' UNHAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ The locker room of the Boston Bruins ``is
not a happy place,'' Ray Bourque said Wednesday. ``And that's
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that ``negativity,'' to use Bourque's word, is due to a
team piling up loss after loss and going nowhere, but the former
Bruins' captain hinted at more, that he is far from alone in his
frustration about how far the once-proud Boston organization has
fallen.
</P>
<P>
   The defenseman was quoted by Russ Conway of the Lawrence
Eagle-Tribune Tuesday that his decision to leave the Bruins ``is
just the start of what's going to happen. The way things are,
players don't want to play in Boston any more. Nobody's happy here;
ownership doesn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque did not deny that he said these words when his new team,
the Avalanche, arrived in Edmonton after an 8-3 win over Calgary
Tuesday night in his first game with Colorado. However, Bourque
said, ``I do not recall going on the record'' with Conway ``and I
will have to take it up with Russ.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bruins spokesperson, apprised of Bourque's comments in the
newspaper, said general manager Harry Sinden ``did not believe Ray
said that.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, though, Bourque's words spoke only as loud as his
actions. By asking to be traded after 21 years with the Bruins,
Bourque not only sought to achieve a personal goal (winning a
Stanley Cup), but he also made a strong, loud, and concrete
statement that he was giving up on the Bruins. And if Bourque gave
up on the Bruins, who is left to keep the flickering flame?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not winning hockey games, there's a lot more
negativity,'' Bourque said after taking treatment in the Avalanche
dressing room at the Skyreach Centre for a slightly strained groin.
``It's tough . . . and there're a lot of factors to come into play
for that negativity.''
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, it seemed, the frustration piled up until it
was too much to bear. Bourque revealed how startling was his
transformation in merely the last year by reciting an anecdote from
the 1999 All-Star game when Wayne Gretzky asked him if he was going
to retire after the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Wayne I had another year left on my contract, not
knowing that he was going to retire. And I asked him the question,
and he said, `Sure,' but he didn't say one way or the other when he
was going to do it,'' said Bourque. ``But I never talked to him
about a trade, and what it was like to be traded, because I never
thought I'd be asking for a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bourque did precisely that two weeks ago, asking Sinden to
move him. The unthinkable had become the desirable. In one brief
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said he was not alone on the Bruins with his
frustration. ``I think a lot of guys are frustrated,'' he said.
``We went into the year expecting to do a lot better than we did.
It's frustrating and disappointing when you don't get the job done.
You know, we were hampered by some injuries and I don't think we
had the depth to compensate for those injuries. And that was
probably a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A perennial major problem in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Bourque said, this time was different. The Bruins
seldom have had the top-to-bottom talent to compete with the NHL's
best teams. For years, the Bruins often overachieved with grit and
hard work. The Bruins seldom had the talent that Dave Andreychuk
saw on his very first shift on the second line with Colorado, on
the left wing with Peter Forsberg centering and Adam Deadmarsh on
right wing. Andreychuk, who came with Bourque from Boston to the
Avalanche, gushed, ``I couldn't believe how much talent was on the
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Bourque said, his voice dropping to a low level,
``The frustration and discouragement grew to a point where I had to
make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked directly what it would take to return the Bruins to
at least some semblance of pride and success, ``It's deeper . . .
well, some changes . . .'' he began to say.
</P>
<P>
   But then he said, diplomacy once again returning to Bourque's
words, ``We had something good going the last couple of years, and
they have a good base of young talent. Now it's matter of keeping
that and bringing the right players in and just reinforcing things.
There's not much for them to get back to be competitive. For them
to get back to where they want to be might not take all that much
more.''
</P>
<P>
   But should there be organizational changes? Is the problem with
ownership? With the management of Harry Sinden and Mike O'Connell?
Should those changes be made at the top levels before the Bruins
can be successful?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not for me to say,'' replied Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   No need for the words. Bourque's actions already had shouted
louder than any words. The most loyal and faithful Bruin no longer
saw any hope in Boston.

 _ SF CHRON   Defections Hit Upside as Magazine Tries to Get Its Buzz Back 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Upside has been downsized.
<P>
   A wave of defections hit the magazine's top ranks last week, and
the recriminations continue. Editor in Chief Adrian Mello resigned.
Before company chief executive David Bunnell could even officially
announce Mello's replacement, however, five other staffers tendered
their resignations.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell says he fired at least two of the group, and in a way,
he's right: Features Editor Howard Baldwin and Senior Editor
Cameron Crotty had given two weeks' notice last Monday, then
arrived at work Friday to an e-mail from Bunnell telling them they
were fired. Executive Editor Galen Gruman also resigned and was
escorted out of the building for sending what Bunnell called
``poisonous e-mail.'' (Gruman said he merely posted his resignation
letter and those of some of the others.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sorry to see them go,'' Bunnell said.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, though. Most of the high-flying tech-biz magazines
are desperately hiring people, not losing them in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   While Upside is enjoying a strong year _ its news pages have
doubled and its ad revenues have nearly quadrupled, from roughly
$500,000 an issue to $2 million, according to Bunnell _ the
magazine is also trying to hold on in an increasingly competitive
marketplace. Although Upside was founded 10 years ago, making it
the grandaddy of the current wave of ``new economy'' magazines,
other upstarts like the Industry Standard, Business 2.0 and Red
Herring are doing a better job landing high-profile hires and
creating buzz about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the departures is Bunnell's desire to add more
``sizzle'' to Upside, while Mello and the team he brought on sought
to beef up the reporting with investigations and news that
executives could use in running their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Upside getting by more on style than substance,'' Mello
said. Bunnell says his new editor in chief, Jerry Borrell, ``is a
great networker with a lot of energy'' who will help Upside get its
own buzz back. In addition, the magazine launched an ad campaign
this week in AdWeek and Advertising Age magazines, and Bunnell said
Upside Media _ which includes a conference and online business _
will double its staff of 65 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Borrell joins Upside from Sumeria, a maker of multimedia CD-ROMs
that he founded and ran for the past eight years. Before that, he
worked with Bunnell at Macworld magazine _ Mello, Gruman and Crotty
are also Macworld alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell is a mercurial boss who is not afraid to assert his will
over his employees, and as he's turned 50, he hasn't mellowed. Last
year, one run-in ended with Bunnell firing David Coursey, his
conference impresario. Now Upside is on its third editor in a year,
and more than half the people on the masthead in the magazine's
March issue have left the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, it was arrogant of us to think that David would
treat us differently than other people,'' Baldwin said. As he joins
the ranks of people Bunnell has fired, Baldwin said, ``This is a
cool group of people. This is a clique I can go with.''
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Bunnell had one former editor, Kathleen Doler,
e-mail me about her ``great working relationship'' with him. She
left the magazine when the offices moved from San Mateo to San
Francisco. Another former editor, Richard Brandt, remains on staff
as a columnist while he continues to ready a startup for launch.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell maintains the title of editor of Upside. While some of
the departed say that was largely a ceremonial role until recently,
Bunnell maintains he was always active in picking covers and
generating story ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers, though, say that as Bunnell began insinuating himself
more into the news operation, editorial employees grew disaffected,
which led to last week's five departures.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell attacked those who left as ``not very energetic. They
all left at 5.'' While Gruman disputed the charge, noting his
passion for the magazine, Baldwin acknowledged he left at 5 p.m.
daily _ but only because he arrived each morning at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vitriol and rumors that more departures are still on
the way, Bunnell maintains tremendous optimism. ``We had a little
bit of a hiccup, but things are good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's buoyed by a recent $2 million investment and an $8 million
loan; he's tripling the online staff; he's opening new sales
offices in Los Angeles, Seattle and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and
doubling his New York office; and his events business is
``incredibly profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he's got a new editor hiring a new team at the flagship
magazine. He's a feisty independent taking on bigger publishers
like International Data Group, Conde Nast and Imagine Media.
``We're in for a battle,'' he said. ``Don't count us out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MARKET MOVERS: &QL; 
Is MarketWatch.com gloating over the current woes of TheStreet.com?
And if so, is that an attempt to knock down TheStreet's stock price
to make it ripe for a takeover by MarketWatch?
</P>
<P>
   That's the scenario painted by a shareholder in TheStreet.com,
who e-mailed me with some keen observations. The backdrop is
TheStreet's announcement that it had hired an investment bank to
pursue strategic options _ the standard euphemism for putting a
company on the block _ and a New York Times report that MarketWatch
had made a bid to buy TheStreet, but that was denied.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mailer cited two stories that appeared on the MarketWatch
Web site, in which MarketWatch CEO Larry Kramer and Editor in Chief
Thom Calandra are quoted as saying TheStreet made a bad business
move by charging for information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really appears as if MarketWatch wants to make
TheStreet.com look bad, but that it doesn't want to make itself
look bad by admitting that its bid to buy TheStreet was rejected,''
said my e-mailer. ``That's fine, but using your own news site to do
this can't be ethical. It also looks like MarketWatch wants to use
its site to talk down the price of (TheStreet) and make it easier
for them to do a hostile takeover. If so, that's got to be against
the SEC laws.''
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a charge, and it has Kramer and Calandra hopping
mad. ``That really frosts me,'' Kramer said. He said he told his
reporters the same thing he's told others in the press for months,
that TheStreet publishes great journalism, but with a flawed
business model. MarketWatch gives its information away free, while
TheStreet has charged for most of its content.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Calandra noted, ``What did we report that others
haven't reported that could have hurt the stock of TheStreet.com?''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer and Calandra refused to comment on whether MarketWatch
was a suitor for TheStreet.
</P>
<P>
   My e-mailer may be wrong on one point: George Harmon, who
teaches business journalism at Northwestern University, said it's
not likely MarketWatch's comments could hurt TheStreet's stock
price. ``Is any investor going to act on that information alone,
when you know where it's coming from?'' Harmon asks. ``The public
now pretty well assumes that an awful lot of what they read in the
media is tainted by commercial concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's legal, though, Len Sellers, a professor of
journalism at San Francisco State University, agrees that
MarketWatch's ethics seem questionable. MarketWatch, Sellers said,
``considers as legitimate news the turmoil in a competitor's
business, especially when they're a possible takeover target? That
doesn't strike me as straight-up journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers said editors are obsessed with the price of their own
stock, harming the quality of the reporting. ``It's like they're
pushed into the position of being their own billboards, given that
everything revolves around the stock, and the stock revolves around
the public's perception,'' Sellers said. ``Did you ever see the
Associated Press write demeaning stories about UPI? It just didn't
happen in the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHO SAID THAT? &QL; 
A few weeks back, I used the old saw about journalists' role being
to ``comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.'' Someone
e-mailed to say I should have attributed that to its author, H.L.
Mencken. I had conducted some cursory research and couldn't confirm
Mencken's authorship, so I left it unattributed.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Chronicle librarian Kathleen Rhodes has done some digging
since then, and while she found that many people cite Mencken as
the originator of the line, she also found that Mencken himself
claimed no such credit. In a dictionary of quotations that Mencken
gathered and edited, he put the quote in, but cited the author as
``Anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Rhodes found, was that the line originated with
Finley Peter Dunne, an American journalist and humorist who lived
from 1867 to 1936 and who was best known for columns and books
written under the name of his alter ego, an Irish American tavern
owner named ``Mr. Dooley.''

DESPITE CALLING FOR HALT, GORE CHASES SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JOHN BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as Vice President Al Gore challenges Gov.
George W. Bush to stop raising the unlimited campaign donations
known as soft money, Gore aides are launching a program to help the
Democrats raise $35 million in such funds over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic fund-raisers have been invited to a luncheon
here later this month with Gore, who is expected to ask each of
them to raise at least $100,000 in soft money before the Democratic
convention in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, the party will host a tribute to President Clinton,
who has already raised more than $10 million for the Democratic
National Committee this year, virtually all of it soft money. The
May gala, presided over by Democratic fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe,
is expected to produce as much as $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Edward G. Rendell, the general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, told a group of donors on Tuesday night that
the party needed to raise $35 million before the convention in
August to finance a ``mini-campaign'' of television advertisements
designed to highlight policy differences with the Republicans. The
commercials, still in the planning stages, were expected to
emphasize gun control, reform of health maintenance organizations,
taxes and campaign finance, issues on which Democrats believed they
closely reflected public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell told the group, meeting at the home of New Jersey state
Sen. Raymond J. Lesniak, a top Gore fund-raiser, that he expected
Bush and the Republicans to raise and spend twice as much on issue
advertisements before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, Gore would hit the spending ceiling for
the primary season, and his top fund-raisers would focus almost all
their efforts on raising soft money from corporations, unions and
wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans were under way because Gore and his advisers were
certain that Bush and the Republicans would not agree to the soft
money cease-fire challenge issued by the vice president on Tuesday
night. Bush swatted away a similar offer from Sen. John McCain, his
all-but-vanquished primary rival, and he dismissed Gore's challenge
Wednesday as a stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to make America forget what went on in Washington,
D.C., for the past eight years,'' Bush said on ``Good Morning
America'' on ABC. ``Americans aren't going to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that his party would continue to raise soft money
as long as the Republicans did.
</P>
<P>
   With his nomination-sealing victories in Tuesday's primaries,
Gore became, in effect, the leader of the Democratic Party. The
party's fund-raising, polling, organizing and communications arms
would quickly come under his control and would turn their efforts
to electing him president. In return, Gore would share with Clinton
the job of solicitor-in-chief for the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Al's turn to step up to the plate,'' said one long-time
Democratic fund-raiser who insisted on anonymity. ``The president
has carried all the work'' of the Democratic National Committee.
``Now Al has to get out there and energize people to raise a ton of
dough.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore would have about $13 million in campaign funds to spend
between now and the Democratic convention in August, including $7
million in anticipated federal primary election matching funds,
aides said. Because Gore accepts federal matching funds, he must
limit his overall spending during the primaries to about $44
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who isn't taking matching funds and can spend whatever he
likes, has gone through virtually all of the $70 million he raised
for his primary campaign. He was embarking on a new money-raising
spree to support his efforts before the Republicans meet in late
July to formally nominate him for president. His top fund-raisers,
the Pioneers, will soon be shifting their efforts to raising
hundreds of millions of soft money.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican fund-raiser said that the aid of the Pioneers, who
each raised at least $100,000 in restricted contributions to Bush's
campaign, would be crucial in achieving the party's goal of raising
more than $175 million in soft money to support Bush and other
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   As both the Bush and Gore campaigns shifted their sights to the
November elections, their supporters were devising ways to raise
what strategists say would be a record amount of these unlimited
and increasingly controversial contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the fund-raising equivalent of Sherman's
march through Georgia,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of
Democracy 21, a non-partisan group here that monitors campaign
spending. ``Donors beware _ they are coming for you, and the sky's
the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer said he had no expectation of Bush accepting Gore's
offer of a soft money cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of a soft money moratorium occurring this year
range from slim to none, with the emphasis on none,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A long-time Gore ally and fund-raiser said that the Democratic
National Committee has also created a ``federal victory fund'' that
would raise hard money contributions only for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between hard money and soft money is that hard
dollars, raised under federal limits, could be used to expressly
advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. Most soft money
could only be used indirectly, advocating positions that the party
supports and criticizing policies of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they have a contingency plan to raise soft money,''
the fund-raiser said. Clinton and Gore, as the party's two biggest
draws, would do the bulk of the soft-money prospecting, he said.

HACKER CHANGES GRADES OF 22 AT MIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A hacker broke into an MIT computer system
and altered the grades of 22 students in a biology class, institute
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The grades of 20 of 120 students in an undergraduate cell
biology class were lowered, while two others were given higher
marks, said officials of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The professor and teaching assistants for the class declined to
talk about the investigation, but an institute spokesman said
officials have identified someone from outside the class as the
culprit. The spokesman would not say whether the person was a
student at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   The grade-tampering scandal has left students uneasy, since the
professor, Harvey Lodish, announced there had been a cheating
incident at the end of class last Thursday, pleading for students
to come forward if they knew who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, my only hope was that it was someone from
outside the class,'' sophomore Tara Mullaney, 19, said before a
section of the class met Wednesday. ``Since then, (the professor
and teaching assistants) have been trying to keep this low.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching assistants noticed changes to grades on the class's
first exam after comparing hard copies with scores recorded on the
computer. Believing that the school's computer system is secure,
professors suspect that the hacker filched one of their passwords,
students said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lodish and the teaching assistants were tight-lipped about
the breach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not talk with you about this,'' Lodish responded to a
Bostn Globe query by e-mail. ``The situation is being resolved, and
all discussions about this issue are completely confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Campbell, an institute spokesman, said that the person
responsible for the tampering had been identified and that school
officials are investigating the person's motive and means of
access.
</P>
<P>
   Some students speculated that the hacker may have intended to
set up the students whose grades were raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know who they are and why they did it,'' said Alanna
Pinkerton, 19, a junior in the biology class. ``The professors and
the teaching assistants also know; everything else is hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   The two students whose grades were increased are unlikely to
have left themselves open to cheating charges, a member of the
biology faculty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wouldn't be a sensible thing to increase your own
grades,'' said Bob Sauer, chairman of the biology department. ``But
what I've heard is it's something far less nefarious.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been previous incidents of cheating at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, 78 of the 250 undergraduates in an introductory
engineering course were found to have turned in identical computer
codes on a homework assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those students said cheating was rampant at MIT. A study
a year later found that 83 percent of MIT students admitted to
cheating on homework at least once during the 1991-92 school year.
</P>
<P>
   In that survey, nearly half of all students admitted stealing
other people's phraseology, ideas, or arguments. More than 40
percent said they had misrepresented or fudged data in a lab report
or research paper, and about one-fifth said they had copied from
another person's paper or published work without acknowledgment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the consequences for cheating at MIT are grave.
</P>
<P>
   If the hacker responsible for tampering with the grades in the
cell biology class is a student, then he or she could face
expulsion, institute officials said.

17 ARMS EXPERTS NAMED FOR U.N. PANEL ON DISARMING IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Seventeen international arms experts have been
chosen for a new commission charged with completing the disarmament
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hans Blix, a Swedish lawyer and the former head of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, will lead the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has until Thursday to comment on the names
proposed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan before the appointments
are formally made.
</P>
<P>
   The new panel, the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission, is replacing the U.N. Special Commission, or Unscom,
which began the process of disarming Iraq in 1991 after the Persian
Gulf war. Iraq, which has to be certified free of prohibited
weapons before international sanctions imposed in 1990 are lifted,
stopped cooperating with Unscom almost two years ago and has not
signaled that it will allow a successor organization to operate
there.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new commissioners are three _ from Britain, Canada and
Finland _ who were also Unscom commissioners. The U.S. commissioner
on Unscom, Charles Duelfer, who was also its deputy chairman,
resigned last week. The United States apparently decided not to
renominate him.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative on the new board will be Robert Einhorn,
assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, who has 25
years' experience working on arms control in government, the
Council on Foreign Relations and the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The list of commissioners, forwarded to the Security Council by
Jayantha Dhanapala, the undersecretary general for disarmament who
participated in the selection, has fewer strictly technical experts
or scientists and more political appointees drawn government
arms-control offices.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they will serve as an advisory board to Blix, who
became the new chief arms inspector for Iraq on March 1. He is a
full-time chairman. The commissioners are part-time consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is considered more broadly representative of the U.N.
membership than Unscom, which was dominated by experts from
industrial nations with advanced weapons systems. The new body has
members from Argentina, Brazil, India, Nigeria, Senegal and
Ukraine, as well as from Canada, Finland, Germany and Japan. All
five permanent members of the Security Council _ Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States _ are represented, as is the
U.N. department of disarmament affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, who said at a news conference last week that he intended
to use the commission as a sounding board, is creating a work plan
and an organizational chart, which are not expected to be completed
until early next month. At that point, Blix, the United Nations and
the commission's full-time staff will be faced with the challenge
of selling the plan to President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, David Albright, president of the independent
Institute for Science and International Security and a former
nuclear inspector in Iraq, said that based on Blix's record in
North Korea in the early 1990s, he might surprise critics who still
held him responsible for earlier missing a secret Iraqi program as
director of the atomic energy agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In North Korea, it was quite clear that Blix knew he had to be
extremely determined,'' said Albright, who is writing a book on the
clandestine North Korean nuclear program. When Blix decided
international monitors there were not tough enough, Albright said,
``he brought in a more senior team that had gained experience in
Iraq at dealing with massive lying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He also pushed to have the best analytical methods used,''
Albright said. ``That was critical in uncovering evidence of North
Korean lying. He showed that he was more than able to confront
North Korea.''

THE MORAL BLINDNESS OF A `HUMANITARIAN'
</HEADLINE>
 DEATH-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curiosity can be a filmmaker's greatest gift, and Errol Morris
appears to be blessed with more of it than anyone else making
movies today. Morris, who calls himself a ``nonfiction filmmaker,''
is obsessed with obsessives, fascinated with people who do jobs few
of us would dream of doing. With ``Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of
Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.,'' Morris may have found his most compelling
and tragic obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter, an unassuming-looking professorial type prone to
tweeds, ties and unstylish glasses, emerges as an odd sort of
humanitarian: a man who wanted to make the death penalty more
humane. An electrical engineer, Leuchter devised electric chairs
that did their jobs quickly and efficiently, making executions
safer for the executioners and as painless as possible for the
condemned. His expertise led officials to ask him to perfect other
execution devices _ gas chambers, lethal-injection contraptions,
even gallows _ and he succeeded with each, despite being most
comfortable with electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Leuchter's downfall came in 1988, when a neo-Nazi named Ernst
Zundel enlisted him in an attempt to prove that the Holocaust was a
hoax. Morris provides incredible footage of Leuchter visiting the
Auschwitz concentration camp, illegally taking brick and mortar
samples from what is now a Polish national monument, and doing the
most perfunctory lab tests before deciding that the extermination
of 6 million Jews couldn't have happened.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make sense,'' Leuchter keeps saying, as if
mass murder on any level ever makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Although Morris counters Leuchter's ``research'' with
witheringly dismissive commentary by Robert Jan van Pelt, an
architectural historian who points out dozens of flaws in
Leuchter's findings, Morris isn't out to discredit Leuchter. He
just wants to know what makes him tick, and why Leuchter, a person
on top of his morbid world, would risk his career by aligning
himself with such a questionable cause as Holocaust revisionism.
</P>
<P>
   Morris has been accused of condescending to his subjects, and
criticized for his interviewing method, which essentially involves
leaving the camera running until his subject says something stupid
or self-incriminating. But what comes through in ``Mr. Death'' is
that Morris genuinely likes Leuchter, even sympathizes with him,
although Morris has trouble comprehending why such an affable
oddball would have such dark fascinations.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you may think of Morris as a journalist, he's amazing
as a filmmaker; he's one of the few unique artists working today.
``Mr. Death'' has all his trademarks: nonstop, insistently ethereal
music; a carefully chosen hodgepodge of film stocks and colors;
images that act as counterpoint to what's being said, as well as
images that illustrate points in the most ironic ways. With his
unconventional style, he avoids the earnestness that plagues too
many documentaries (no wonder he doesn't like to be branded a
documentarian). With ``Mr. Death,'' he provides one of the best
depictions yet of how we believe only what we choose to believe,
and how closed-mindedness can be dangerous in more ways than one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.'' is
rated PG-13 for adult themes and disturbing images. &QL;

PRESIDENT SAYS WAGE BILL RAISES MINIMUM TOO SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa.) (jt) 
 By MARC LACEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a checkout clerk at his side, President
Clinton said Wednesday that a minimum wage increase set for a House
vote on Thursday would cut business taxes too much and raise the
pay of low-wage workers too little.
</P>
<P>
   Calling on the Congress to ``stop nickel and diming the American
people,'' the president urged lawmakers to increase the minimum
wage of $5.15 an hour to $6.15 over two years instead of three, and
to drop the proposed tax reductions of $122 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   To put the heat on the Republicans and highlight what is sure to
become an election issue this fall, Clinton held a rally on the
South Lawn of the White House with Democratic leaders of Congress
and Cheryl Costas, a clerk from Pennsylvania who is the sole wage
earner for her disabled husband and four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can you ask this woman to do?'' the president said
of Costas, who studies full time at a local university and works at
Colton Alba Grocery and Gas in Colton Alba, Pa. ``She's kept her
family together. Her husband has a disability. She's supporting her
four kids. She's going to school full time. Now, how can Congress
justify saying no to her?''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, many of whom oppose any minimum wage
increase, are scheduled to take up a bill on Thursday that would
raise the minimum hourly wage to $5.48 this year, $5.81 next April
and $6.15 in April 2002. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority
leader, has called the legislation sponsored by Reps. John Shimkus
of Illinois and Rick A. Lazio of New York, both Republicans, ``the
least worst way to do the wrong thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats want to speed the increase over two years _ 50
cents this year and 50 cents in 2001 _ and drastically scale back
the tax reductions. The Republican plan would make sharp cuts in
the estate tax, accelerate a plan to make health insurance tax
deductible for the self-employed and reduce other taxes for small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The House measure is similar to a Senate bill passed in
February. A $1 increase in the minimum wage over three years was
included in bankruptcy reform legislation that passed, 83 to 14,
along with $76 billion in tax breaks over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Republican congressional leaders on Tuesday,
Clinton threatened to block any bill that provides for large tax
cuts or that spreads the raise over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they have written a compromise bill that helps
minimum wage earners but also provides benefits to the businesses
that must bear the increased payroll costs.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict over the minimum wage dates to 1938, when the first
such hourly wage was set at 25 cents as part of the Fair Labor
Standards Act. Since then, the minimum wage has been increased 19
times. The last change came in 1996 with a two-step increase that
raised the wage to $5.15 from $4.15.
</P>
<P>
   Each side in the debate points to statistics to back up its
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Clinton released a study by the National Economic
Council saying that 10 million workers earn less than $6.15 an hour
and therefore would benefit from the $1 increase. About 69 percent
of them are over 20 years of age, about 45 percent work full time
and about 60 percent are women, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents, who maintain that an increased minimum
wage would mainly go to young people, point to studies saying that
two-thirds of the minimum-wage workers are part-time employees,
more than half are under 25 and only 8 percent are women who are
heads of households. Critics of a wage increase maintain that
businesses, especially small businesses, are hurt by the raises and
tend to lay off workers rather than increase their pay.
</P>
<P>
   Costas, whose pay was raised recently to $5.50 an hour from
$5.15, said her boss was not thrilled by her decision to go to
Washington to make the case for more pay. The owner of the store
told her, she said, that he would probably have to raise prices if
the minimum wage increase passed. She said she told him that the
economy was such that he could probably afford the higher costs.

 &HT;    Georgia turnout far below forecast
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Democratic crossover voters stayed largely on their
side of the political fence _ or at home _ Tuesday, denying
Republican John McCain any chance at upsetting George W. Bush in
Georgia's GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of crossover voters, which had helped spur McCain's
early primary surge, proved to be one of the more salient insights
gleaned Wednesday from exit polls and other voting tabulations by
the pundits and party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the prognosticators cautioned not to read too much into the
primary results. After all, neither Bush nor McCain, nor Democrats
Al Gore and Bill Bradley paid the Peach State much attention before
Super Tuesday. And just more than one-fourth of Georgia's
registered voters even bothered to vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a repeat come November's general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia will be extremely visible and we'll see a lot of the
candidates,'' said state GOP Chairman Chuck Clay. ``It will be a
toughly competed, fought-over state come November. It will
certainly be a donnybrook in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much of a tussle Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only 929,443, or 27.3 percent, of Georgia's 3.4 million voters
hit the polls, according to unofficial returns. Elections officials
had predicted that 38 percent of registered voters would help
decide the Republican and Democratic presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet participation was significantly better than in the 1996
presidential primaries in Georgia when only 19 percent of
registered voters turned out. President Clinton, a Democrat, faced
no primary opposition that year, and Bob Dole handily won the GOP
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's vice president trampled Bradley on Tuesday, corralling
84 percent of the Democratic votes cast in Georgia. Gore bested the
former New Jersey senator in virtually every demographic category,
including male and female voters, whites and blacks, and across
income and educational levels, according to a CNN exit poll.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's victory wasn't as resounding, the Texas governor
still pasted the Arizona senator, 431,091 to 179,362. Mimicking
other primary tilts, Bush won handily among conservatives and the
so-called religious right.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy of appealing to moderates, independents and
Democrats in states with open primaries fell flat in Georgia. Only
8 percent of GOP primary voters described themselves as Democrats,
according to the CNN exit poll. While McCain took a slight majority
of those votes, they were hardly enough to topple Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more surprisingly was Bush's majority support from
independent voters. The GOP's Clay also boasted that more than
twice as many Republicans voted as did Democrats, a rarity in a
Georgia primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear rejection of Clinton-Gore by Georgia voters,''
he said. ``Numbers don't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kirincich, executive director of Georgia's Democratic
Party, scoffed at that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the numbers don't lie,'' he said. ``But the vast majority
of Republicans turned out to be against the man (McCain) who's
probably the better general election candidate. Once again, the far
right wing is flying the Republican Party by itself. ... We've
learned that moderates win elections.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is in much better shape right now than Bush. He was
challenged by Bradley, which pushed him toward the middle,'' said
Bullock. ``McCain forced Bush to the right and away from the
middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bullock notes that Georgia is becoming an increasingly
Republican state. Clinton, for example, narrowly lost Georgia in
the 1996 general election, after narrowly winning the state in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   All that bodes well for a spirited contest this summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get visits from the candidates. We will see their
smiling faces on TV,'' Bullock said. ``And we'll be one of the
states up for grabs.''

McCAIN'S ATTACKS HELPED IN PASSING GAY MARRIAGE BAN 
 
By KIM COBB 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian activists knew recognition of gay marriage would
be a tough sell to California voters, but they contend that
presidential hopeful John McCain's attack on Christian
conservatives killed any chance they had in Tuesday's referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22, prohibiting California from recognizing gay
couples married in another state, passed with 61 percent of the
vote. Exit polls conducted by Voter News Service show that the
measure passed with broad support from men and women, and across
all racial and income groups. But Republicans backed it 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a very hotly contested Republican race that drew a
lot of excitement,'' said Wayne Besen, spokesman for the Human
Rights Campaign, a national gay activist group. ``On top of that,
John McCain's going into the heart of the Bible Belt and blasting
Falwell and Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That mobilized a lot of people who would vote yes to go to the
polls,'' Besen said. ``It certainly motivated members of the
religious right.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by Voter News Service show that of white
voters statewide, about 9 percent identified themselves as
Christian conservatives _ the demographic mix that represents the
so-called religious right. Ninety-two percent of those voters
supported the gay marriage ban.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of those white, Christian conservatives said
McCain's attacks on Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson affected their
vote ``a great deal'' on Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure was destined to pass even before McCain stirred
up the ire of Christian conservatives, argues Bob Stern, president
of the Los Angeles-area Center for Government Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a simple proposition,'' Stern said. ``People understood
what it did, and in a sense, they wanted to send a message. And I
think most people understood it doesn't really affect anything.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The proposition stated, ``Only marriage between a man and a
woman is valid and recognized in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay marriage is not legal in any state, but 31 other states have
passed similar bans since the Hawaii Supreme Court raised the
possibility of legalizing gay marriage in 1993. California is the
third state to adopt the law at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Supreme Court ruled in December that homosexual
unions are entitled to the same benefits and protections as married
couples. The court ordered the state legislature to either legalize
gay marriage, or adopt a broad, domestic partnership law.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to pass the referendum became emotional, at times
focusing on the strained relationship between proposition author,
state Sen. Pete Knight and his gay son, David Knight. Opponents
even turned the advertising spotlight on father and son, alleging
that the elder Knight was forcing a statewide vote in response to a
family problem.
</P>
<P>
   In October, David Knight wrote a column in the Los Angeles Times
opposing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   His father, who tried to maintain a low personal profile on this
issue, then wrote in response that measure opponents ``should be
ashamed for exploiting a private family matter for political gain.
I think their tactics are reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People on both sides feel very strongly about this,'' Stern
said. ``I've very rarely seen lawn signs on statewide propositions.
Clearly the churches were very much involved and handing out these
(supporting) signs.''
</P>
<P>
   A new California law took effect in January allowing gays and
lesbians to register with the state as domestic partners, affording
some same-sex couples benefits _ such as hospital visitation rights
and health insurance coverage _ traditionally enjoyed by married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of a stereotype that California is one of the
most gay friendly states,'' said David Elliot, spokesman for the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ``I'm not sure but that
there's too much weight put on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our movement does not begin in California, and it won't end in
California,'' Elliot said. ``Some state has to go first. Will it be
Rhode Island, Vermont, California? I don't know. But some state has
to go first.''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It may never get any better than this.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Big 12 coaches agree that no fewer than six teams _ five of
them ranked _ have legitimate hopes of winning the league
tournament, which begins today with four first-round games at
Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   What makes matters most interesting is that No. 24 Kansas, the
lowest-ranked of the Top 25 quintuplets, may be the most likely
team to claim the title this weekend. And the league's
highest-ranked squad, No. 7 Iowa State, could be the least likely
to hoist the trophy Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The three teams ranked between Iowa State and Kansas _ No. 13
Texas, No. 15 Oklahoma and No. 17 Oklahoma State _ probably will be
three, four or five seeds in the NCAA Tournament. And all three
believe they will win the Big 12 bash.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a great, great weekend,'' Kansas
coach Roy Williams said. ``So many teams have a chance to win the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot think of a time where you have this many (NCAA)
Tournament-caliber teams at the league tournament. There's been
years where we've had two teams, three teams, maybe four teams
before there's a drop-off. But this year there are six. And a
seventh in the way Colorado can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, which has swept its way to victory in all three previous
Big 12 tournaments, gets to test one of Williams' theories that a
team not seeded among the top four can win four games in four days
to become tournament champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks entered each of the first three league tournaments
as the favorites _ twice as the regular-season champions at 15-1
and last year as a second-place team that had more depth than
regular-season champ Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Jayhawks are true underdogs, with three freshmen
in the starting lineup. Williams doesn't seem to mind, and he lists
three reasons his squad can successfully defend its title.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, because we believe we can,'' Williams said. ``Secondly,
we've had a history of going over there and playing well. And
thirdly, we do have some depth _ not as much as we had earlier, but
over a tournament played on consecutive days, I think that depth
does become a factor there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams sounds almost upbeat in analyzing his team's chances.
Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy is a little more reserved,
realizing his team is at a disadvantage because of its lack of
depth. But Eustachy thinks his team is not getting the respect it
deserves after winning the regular-season crown at 14-2 (with both
losses coming on the road in overtime).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if our team still gets the respect in spite of if
you look at the top (of the standings), there's nobody above us,''
Eustachy said. ``They have respect for our toughness, but in
general _ and I'm not talking about coaches here _ people don't
think we're the seventh-best team in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State seems to thrive on its perceived lack of respect,
though it knows it typically plays only its five starters in the
second half. Consensus Big 12 Player of the Year Marcus Fizer,
Jamaal Tinsley and Michael Nurse all have played at least 33
minutes in each of the Cyclones' last five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at our size and depth, but how many people is
Missouri playing? How many people is Texas playing?'' Eustachy
asked. ``There are a few people that have the luxury of playing 10
to 11 guys. Most of 'em when you look at the box score are playing
seven guys; that's all you need. We like our chances as much as
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Rick Barnes' answer to Eustachy's question about the
Longhorns would probably be: ``As many as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas comes into the tournament in much better shape than it did
a year ago when, like Iowa State, it was a regular-season champion
with no depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no comparison to last year as far as how we are
physically at this point in the season,'' said Barnes, in his
second year at UT. ``We were crawling in last year. (Starting point
guard) Ivan Wagner was playing on one leg, and everybody else was
worn out. It took all we had to win the regular season. We had
nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   Longhorns forward Nnadubem Gabe Muoneke says he can feel the
difference in his body this time around and that fresh legs will
help. Texas, which pounds the ball inside regularly and may be the
most physical defensive team in the conference, expects to wear
teams down over the three days. Any team that gets to the final
against the Longhorns, should they make it there, will have a
difficult time answering the bell for the second half. That is when
7-foot center Chris Mihm (17.8 points, 10.8 rebounds per game),
Muoneke (13.6, 6.4) and Chris Owens (9.3, 5.5) should take over.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of taking over, Oklahoma's Eduardo Najera is about as
capable of doing that as any player in the conference, but he has
been getting help lately from the likes of Nolan Johnson, J.R.
Raymond and Hollis Price.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners sport the second-best overall record in the
conference at 24-5 and are the only team to have wins over Iowa
State, Texas and Oklahoma State. Kansas barely claimed a
three-point win over OU in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, which because of a pair of early losses was never in
first place in the league race, might be the most overlooked team
at the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Sooners coach Kelvin Sampson doesn't want anybody to know
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's keep that a secret,'' Sampson said. ``We've hidden it
all the way to March.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick is still dead, and not even Brian De Palma, the
high priest of cinematic Frankenstein jobs, can resurrect the
master's touch in ``Mission to Mars.'' De Palma _ who has made more
than his share of trite scripts into at-least-watchable movies by,
shall we say, creatively borrowing from the best visual stylists in
film history _ proves incapable of working up compositional
enthusiasm for the most ``2001''-ish scenes in this drab mission.
You can't really blame him, but it's impossible not to have
expected something, anything, more as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing here to match the director's great Hitchcock-inspired
moments or his hypnotic ``Untouchables'' restaging of Eisenstein's
Odessa Steps massacre. Heck, ``Mission: Impossible'' had better
``Space Odyssey'' bits than ``Mars'' does. And the earlier movie's
notoriously incoherent script was a lot more fun than this one's
multiwriter mishmash of numbing expositional dialogue, `50s-vintage
space opera and New Age sci-fi spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   An ensemble of usually fine actors can't bring much conviction
to the alternately underwhelming and hokey proceedings, either. Set
some 20 years in the future, the film opens, unengagingly as
humanly possible, at a backyard barbecue. A group of best-buddy
astronauts and their families are there to say goodbye to the
comrades heading off to a red planet research station.
</P>
<P>
   Important Character Information divulged here. Jim (Gary
Sinise), was to have led the mission with his wife, Maggie (``NYPD
Blue's'' Kim Delaney, seen in videoloop flashbacks), but she got
sick and died, and he still feels bad about that. Fortunately,
another astro-couple, Woody (Tim Robbins) and Terri (Connie
Nielsen), are healthy, since they really love each other. And Luke
(Don Cheadle) also has a happy marriage and an adorable young son.
</P>
<P>
   These great folks live in a world where cars don't use gasoline
anymore and beer comes in cartons. After some 10 minutes of this
zydeco-scored triviality, you'll be ready to go anywhere the least
bit more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Which Mars marginally proves to be. A year or so later, Luke and
his small command of expendables discover something that shouldn't
be on the supposedly uninhabited, oppressively burnt sienna rock.
Then something terrible happens and communications are severed. It
takes a few months, but Jim, Woody, Terri and unfunny comedy relief
guy Phil (Jerry O'Connell) head out on a rescue mission as soon as
they can.
</P>
<P>
   This trip is the film's best segment. It presents a kind of
workaday view of the details and dangers of deep space travel, and
gives De Palma and his visual team, which includes his regular
cinematographer Stephen H. Burum, opportunities to play around with
zero-gravity gags and loop-the-loop camera tricks. Not a single
scene bears the subtle dread or alienating disorientation of
whichever ``2001'' moment it resembles (the computer, which is no
threat here, even has a soothingly effete, HAL-sounding voice), but
at least they're all staged pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   The climactic events on Mars are not as adroitly done. De Palma
gives up on the bad Kubrick riffs and goes for ``Close
Encounters''-era Spielberg at this point, and it's certainly no
improvement. Fundamentally a gleeful manipulator as an artist and a
cynic about the human condition, De Palma is just not
tempermentally attuned to either the cool awesomeness of Kubrick's
vision or Spielberg's warm sense of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no film should try to incorporate both of those
tones, especially when employing dialogue and dramaturgy of ``Lost
in Space'' quality. ``Mission to Mars''' was as doomed as JPL's
last polar lander from the start, no matter who was at the helm. &QL;

AN EXUBERANT EFFORT IN `DETERRENCE'

<P>
   It's easy to overlook a lot of the flaws in the taut political
thriller ``Deterrence,'' simply because the drama at the core of
the story is so compelling. Essentially ``Fail Safe'' in a diner,
the movie follows a poker-faced U.S. president who must decide
whether to push the nuclear button and change history as we know
it. Writer-director Rod Lurie, a former film critic for KABC radio
and Los Angeles magazine, manages to keep things ambiguous enough
to let the audience draw its own conclusions about the characters'
actions. This is a thought-provoking movie sure to prompt some
heated discussion among moviegoers after the lights go up.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 2008. President Walter Emerson (Kevin Pollak) is in
the midst of an election-year campaign swing through Colorado when
a freak blizzard forces him and his staff to hole up in a
small-town diner. Emerson's appeal to voters isn't going so well.
He was an appointed vice president who took over the Oval Office
duties when the previous president died. From broadcast reports, we
learn the public does't consider him ``presidential.'' True enough,
Emerson looks (and sometimes acts) like the guy next door.
</P>
<P>
   Just four months on the job, Emerson has other problems as well.
North and South Korean forces are engaged in a standoff. U.S.
military forces are stationed along the 38th parallel, fearing a
Chinese attack on Japan. And then while stranded in the diner,
Emerson, his chief of staff Marshall Thompson (Timothy Hutton) and
national security adviser (Sheryl Lee Ralph) learn from a news
report that Iraqi forces have invaded Kuwait and are aiming
biological and chemical weapons at Israel, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   What to do, what to do? With most of the country's military
might focused on Korea, Emerson feels backed into a corner and
makes a monumental threat toward Iraq. The remainder of
``Deterrence'' explores the mechanics involved in such a decision,
as well as gradually revealing the motivations behind the
president's seemingly rash behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Pollak is a perfect choice to play the hard-to-read president,
who has the fragile temperament of a non-elected official with
something to prove to the American people. It's a wonderfully
written role, full of nuances and layers, and Pollak manages to
make him both a devil and a hero. (Your interpretation will
probably depend on your political leanings.)
</P>
<P>
   Lurie does a good job directing traffic in a movie that is
basically a single-location film. His limitations as first-time
filmmaker (as well as the movie's budget restrictions) betray him
in other areas, however, particularly the editing and camera work.
Shooting the first five minutes of the movie in black-and-white and
then abruptly shifting to color adds nothing of meaning to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, so good when it sticks to the crisis at hand,
veers into shaky territory when focusing on the ``average folk''
who happen to be in the diner during the standoff. These locals
are, for the most part, one-dimensional stereotypes, including a
white-trash, racist truckdriver and a French Canadian waitress
whose accent veers all over the North American map.
</P>
<P>
   That ``Deterrence'' is smart, suspenseful and engrossing enough
to overcome these problems is a testament both to Lurie's writing
and the unnerving nature of the movie's central story. This is a
bracing, cautionary tale, perfect for the charged climate of an
election year. &QL;

   It takes an imagination as perverse as Roman Polanski's to even
think of making a horror movie about reading. But it requires a
much richer vein of sick creativity to make the concept work, if it
can be done at all. Regardless, ``The Ninth Gate'' fails to do the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Handsome and tedious, repetitive and pointless, much too long
and not the least bit scary, this beat-the-devil number stumbles
into all the bad genre traps that Polanski made superb fun of, lo
those many years ago, in 1967's ``The Fearless Vampire Killers.''
But here, the arcane puzzles, dopey chases, silly rituals and
unsatisfactory explanations that are the hallmarks of inept Gothic
storytelling are indulged with, if not dead seriousness, at least
deadly cinematic languor.
</P>
<P>
   And did I mention that the movie tries to make reading scary?
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Depp plays scummy New York rare books expert Dean Corso.
A completely mercenary lone wolf, he makes a nice living tricking
bereaved heirs out of valuable volumes for relative peanuts, then
reselling them to ruthless collectors or wised-up dealers. One of
his clients, wealthy publisher Boris Balkan (Frank Langella, even
more miscast than he was in that ``Lolita'' remake and taking every
opportunity to prove it), offers Corso an obscene amount of money
to authenticate a recently acquired addition to his satanic
literature library: ``The Ninth Gate,'' a 17th-century tome
purportedly co-written by Lucifer himself.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other copies are known to exist, and Balkan wants Corso
to go to Lisbon and Paris to compare them with his edition.
However, Liana Tefler (Lena Olin, channeling her murderous virago
from ``Romeo Is Bleeding,'' if not any of that performance's nasty
nutso joy), the widow of the man who sold the book to Balkan, wants
it back in the worst way. After the few people who can stand him
are killed, Corso hightails it out of Manhattan for a thrilling
European adventure _ which mainly involves, yes, reading, comparing
woodcut illustrations and walking around a lot.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is tolerable for about an hour. The film has a great
musty/decadent look (shot by ``Seven'' and ``The Beach's'' Darius
Khondji, designed by Coppola favorite Dean Tavoularis) and it
evokes some of that subtly eerie atmosphere of indefinable dread we
associate with such Polanski masterpieces as ``Repulsion,''
``Rosemary's Baby,'' ``Chinatown'' and ``The Tenant.''
</P>
<P>
   The film even reaches a divine moment of trademark comic
grotesquery at midpoint, when Corso encounters twin, wizened
Portugese booksellers (both played by Jose Lopez Rodero, a veteran
production manager making his acting debut) who orbit each other in
a weird symbiotic rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   But it's downhill from there. Depp's performance, which started
out with possibilities, grows steadily less interesting as Corso
reads his way into ever-deeper trouble; it's like watching a cipher
devolve into a non-entity.
</P>
<P>
   The film's pace picks up from moribund to frantic (to invoke the
title of another Polanski non-thriller where nothing of interest
happens) in the last half hour, and its precise visuals descend
into sloppiness, too. You get the feeling that Polanski suddenly
realized that the film should be over, but couldn't figure out
exactly how to put an end to it.
</P>
<P>
   The lovely, untalented Emmanuelle Seigner keeps making
appearances as kickboxing kind of guardian angel/demon babe
whenever Corso really needs help. It's never made clear what her
nameless character's purpose is, though it could accurately be
described as ``director's wife wanted a job.'' And it has been so
long since Polanski has made a decent movie, she was probably wise
to grab her chance while she still could.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO OUTER-SPACE MOVIES?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Friday, March 10 or later.) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having fashioned a directorial career that's awash in cinematic
quotes and insider jokes, it isn't surprising to watch Brian De
Palma's latest big-screen forgery, ``Mission to Mars,'' and find
that the movie pays homage at every turn to Stanley Kubrick's
sci-fi classic ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' From the camera movements
to the set design to the film's very ending, ``Mission to Mars''
plays like a popcorn reproduction of ``2001,'' save for one
important differenc: Where Kubrick took pleasure in confounding
audiences with a vagueness dressed up as something profound, De
Palma's picture spells out every twist and turn with dialogue and
exposition that would sound cheesy on a ``Baywatch'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   But then, maybe we shouldn't bust De Palma's chops for being
derivative. Judging from this year's lineup of science-fiction
movies, new ideas for outer-space films seem to be in short supply.
If space is indeed the final frontier, Hollywood at the moment is
circling its wagons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernova,'' the first entry in this year's space race, was a
movie that was so bad that director Walter Hill bailed more than a
year before its release, refusing to have his name attached to the
project. Since Joe Eszterhas' ``An Alan Smithee Film'' permanently
ruined that directorial pseudonym, ``Supernova'' was credited to a
``Thomas Lee.'' There is no Thomas Lee in the Directors Guild of
America, but anyone named Thomas Lee (including the home video
star) should sue for defamation of character. The $65 million movie
disappeared from theaters without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black,'' the year's second space movie, at least had
some interesting eye candy to go along with its derivative ideas.
But at its core, it was just another ``Alien'' rehash, albeit
slightly better than most of its ilk. (And, yes, that is damning
with faint praise.)
</P>
<P>
   What's left for outer-space fans after these travesties and
``Mission to Mars''? Not much. Two big-budget entries are slated
for the summer. The first, ``Battlefield Earth,'' finds
Scientologist John Travolta scoring brownie points with his sect
for starring in this adaptation of movement founder L. Ron
Hubbard's evil alien novel. The movie's script has drawn a great
deal of derision on Internet fan boy sites, and photos showing
Travolta in alien makeup have only made things worse. (Typical
comment: He looks like a hairy egghead in a Gucci leather coat.)
</P>
<P>
   Clint Eastwood's ``Space Cowboys,'' due in August, has some
promise, particularly since many of the best space movies push the
same buttons as classic westerns. (George Lucas and Steven
Spielberg paid their respects to the John Ford masterpiece ``The
Searchers'' with cinematic nods in ``Star Wars'' and ``Close
Encounters of the Third Kind.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' has Eastwood (who directs), Tommy Lee Jones,
Donald Sutherland and James Garner playing a group of old-timers
blasting into space on one final mission. Eastwood originally
wasn't interested in the project until he saw life imitate art when
77-year-old John Glenn returned to space in 1998. Perhaps we'll
hear Sinatra singing ``You Make Me Feel So Young'' on the
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The year's final space movie, ``Red Planet,'' has the potential
to give ``Supernova'' and ``Battlefield Earth'' a run for sheer
camp value. The movie was shot last summer in the Jordanian desert
and Australia, spawning numerous headlines for an epic feud between
stars Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore. (Both denied the rift in USA
Today.) Supposedly, by the end of the shoot, the actors refused to
appear in scenes together. (A report that Sizemore took out a
restraining order against Kilmer is untrue, however.)
</P>
<P>
   The film, like Kilmer's ``The Island of Dr. Moreau,'' probably
won't be as interesting as the behind-the-scenes dispatches. The
plot has Kilmer and Sizemore leading a colonizing astronaut team to
Mars after Earth suffers several crippling environmental blows.
Killer space worms also figure into the mix. ``Red Planet'' is
directed by commercial auteur Anthony Hoffman, who was reportedly
found curled up in a fetal position (naked, no less) toward the end
of the production.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's best hope for spurring Mars mania won't come until
next year, when the King of the World, James Cameron, releases two
Mars projects, a five-hour miniseries for network television and an
hourlong 3D IMAX film. Unlike ``Mission to Mars'' and ``Red
Planet,'' Cameron's works will be deeply rooted in science, a fact
that cheers NASA nuts to no end. Both are schedule for launch next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The two projects will revolve around the same plot line,
treating the first manned mission to Mars in a pseudo-documentary
fashion, as if it has already happened. Cameron is writing the
miniseries with Al Reinert, who was among the writers on ``Apollo
13'' and Tom Hanks' HBO miniseries ``From the Earth to the Moon.''
Martha Coolidge will direct the project, while Cameron will helm
the IMAX movie. It will be his first film since ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sent men to the moon, it changed them forever, but
sometimes those changes took years to manifest,'' Cameron recently
told an audience at the Mars Society Conference. ``Well, the Mars
crew will be away from Earth for years, and we'll get to see those
changes take place.''
</P>
<P>
   By fixing his movie and miniseries on science, Cameron may have
found the best way around the cliches that have plagued recent
space movies. ``What we want to show,'' Cameron says, ``is
something that is plausible and defendable.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the public's fascination with Mars clearly remains
high, given the media coverage of NASA's attempts to probe the
planet. The fact that most of NASA's missions have failed miserably
(``lost to the great galactic ghoul,'' engineers joke) only further
whets curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they fail, it's better for us because it makes Mars
even more mysterious,'' says ``Red Planet'' producer Mark Canton.
``Maybe these movies will make us want to take on the challenge of
solving the mystery once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron is banking on it, both for the sake of his projects and
his own questioning mind. At the Mars Society Conference, he vowed
to stir up ``Mars fever.'' That might be a daunting task if both
``Mission to Mars'' and ``Red Planet'' tank. But then Cameron has
triumphed over long odds before. There are a lot of science-fiction
fans hoping he again accomplishes his mission. &QL;

GORE AND BUSH SET FOR FIERY RACE, STARTING AT ONCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strategists for Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
said Wednesday that there would be no let up from the primary
season as they move quickly to define each other on the stump and
on the air in an unusually frenetic five-month run up to their
parties' nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns recalled how Bob Dole in 1996 and Michael Dukakis
in 1988 lay dormant in the summer before the general election,
allowing their rivals to gain the upper hand through television or
oratorical barrages. This time, officials on both sides said, that
will not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer competitiveness of the race _ early polls show Gore
and Bush running neck and neck _ also seems to be driving each
candidate to be engaged earlier and more forcefully than past
campaigns. Even if the candidates wanted to lay low, strategists on
both sides said, they could not because of the proliferation of
coverage on the Internet and on new cable television outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a continued focus on message each and every
day,'' said Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist. ``Virtually every
day, Bush will be somewhere in a position to comment on something
of significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, put it this way:
``Strap on your seat belt. The roller coaster ride has just begun.
If people think the pace has been intense up to this point, they
haven't seen anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side is aggressively seeking the loyalties of the
independents and Democrats who flocked to Sen. John McCain, and
they are also battling over a small group of swing voters, mostly
in the Midwest, who are usually pivotal to the outcome. Strategists
in both camps said they were scheduling trips to the battleground
states of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are also taking special steps to address their
own vulnerabilities. Bush, for example, is planning international
trips _ one possibility is trips to European capitals _ to
demonstrate his grasp of international affairs and military
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to win over McCain's supporters with an extensive
series of town meetings with independent and undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a year when not advertising but contact with the
people has actually matters a lot,'' said Robert Shrum, one of
Gore's chief strategists. ``You will see Al Gore doing a lot of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, advertising is at the heart of both campaign's
blueprints in the coming months. Bush is counting on a financial
advantage because he did not accept federal subsidies in the
primaries and therefore, unlike Gore, is not subject to spending
caps. But both the Republican and Democratic Parties are collecting
so-called unregulated soft money which officials in the two
campaigns said the parties would channel into issue advertising
intended to help or hurt Bush or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials do not like talking publicly about the plans
for television blitzes. Asked what his campaign had in store, Rove
said: ``We have flexibility. We have footage collected. And we have
thoughts developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrum, even less direct, said, ``I don't want to talk about
that.'' Pressed further, he added, ``The Gore campaign will be
ready to do what it has to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A telling sign of how quickly the campaigns have shifted to
general election strategies _ even before either candidate has
officially accumulated enough delegates to win the nomination _ was
in the victory speeches by Bush and Gore on Tuesday night. It is
customary in such addresses for candidates to refer only briefly to
the race ahead. But Bush and Gore spelled out what their advisers
said Wednesday would be basic themes for the general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are racing to the center by highlighting their
more moderate stands. Bush is seeking to paint Gore as a creature
of Washington who, despite his deep involvement as vice president,
could not make sufficient progress on issues ranging from education
to health case. They will also raise questions about his character
by reminding voters of his ties to President Clinton _ and of his
own role in the 1996 campaign finance debacle.
</P>
<P>
   In a theme that Bush officials said they hope will reverberate
month after month, Bush declared on Tuesday: ``America must not
give Clinton-Gore four more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond attacking Gore, the Bush campaign is seeking to generate
appeal, especially among women, by stressing the ``compassionate
conservative'' message upon which he based the early days of his
candidacy. In particular, Bush's aides said they expect him to
speak frequently about education and his accomplishments as
governor of Texas to teach children how to read and write.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, will emphasize his own credentials on the
education issue and seek credit for his role in presiding over the
hardiest economy in decades. On a host of issues, Gore will portray
Bush as intolerant and as a vessel for the religious right and
extremists. His aides said he will accuse Bush of being against gun
control, a woman's right to have an abortion, a patient's bill of
rights and against environment regulations. As Gore asserted on
Tuesday, he will ridicule the governor's economic proposals as part
of a ``risky tax scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Several strategists in both parties said the candidates acted so
aggressively to put forth their themes because their greatest fear
is that they will be defined by their opponents _ and forfeit the
opportunity to alter their images.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first guy to let down his guard loses in these races,''
said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant. ``So I don't
see any fallow period any more in elections. The lesson Bill
Clinton taught everyone is you don't lay low. And Republicans have
learned that too.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their planned hectic campaign schedules, aides to Bush
and Gore offered some caveats. Their candidates, they said, could
conceivably take some time off. But they were careful to avoid the
word ``vacation,'' and to note that any respite would be only
brief.
</P>
<P>
   More than one aide recalled how after Dukakis captured the
Democratic nomination, he returned to his home state of
Massachusetts _ where he was governor _ and virtually vanished from
the national scene. For weeks, he tended mostly to state business
and rarely ventured beyond the western border of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists said they are not eager for the intense period
of stumping, but see no other option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the voters want to be inundated with political
campaigning every day for the next 35 weeks,'' said Haley Barbour,
an adviser to Bush and former chairman of the Republican Party.
``However, with 24-hour news television and the internet and the
vastly increased news outlets, I feel the press won't let it rest.
Every news organization is going to demand a Bush story and a Gore
story every day.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic Party,
seemed eager for the action. Already, he said, the party has begun
making decisions on advertising ``based literally on hourly reads
on where the candidates are and where they're going _ we're looking
forward to continual engagement. It will be fluid and dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, is the voters will tire of the
candidates. But that does not seem to weigh heavily in the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is, if you're not keeping your periscope up that you
might be forgotten,'' said Ronald Kaufman, a Republican national
committeeman from Massachusetts. ``Overexposure is the last thing
to worry about. Not the first.''

 &HT;    Bush outside of election winning political middle, analysts say
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ On his last visit to Ohio before he thrashed
Arizona Sen. John McCain on Tuesday, George W. Bush politely
bristled when asked if campaigning for the Republican presidential
nomination had pushed him to the political right.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no one pushes me,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but with the general election campaign all but
officially started, the perception right now is that Vice President
Al Gore, not Bush, occupies the political middle that is crucial to
winning Ohio and the nation Nov. 7, said political scientist Robert
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will try to further that perception in Ohio later this
month _ a date is not certain _ with a visit to Cincinnati, said
David Leland, Ohio Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exit polls show that he (Bush) is quote, `too
conservative.' ... He is too far to the right,'' said Adams of
Wright State University. ``He is going to have to make some moves
to the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Another political analyst, John Green of the University of
Akron, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is further from the center than Gore,'' Green said.
``Bush has further to move.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic campaign, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley
did not push Gore to the left in the same way McCain succeeded in
depicting Bush as a right-winger, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think very much that Gore is in command of the heights right
now,'' he said. ``Gore is where he should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, said Adams, ``is going to be playing that Bob Jones tape
over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams referred to Bush's campaign stop during the South Carolina
primary at Bob Jones University, where a ban against interracial
dating was recently rescinded and where leaders frequently have
made anti-Catholic statements.
</P>
<P>
   But, Adams said, there is plenty of time for Bush to move more
to the center by building on his record of achievement in Texas in
areas such as education.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Paduchik, executive director of Bush's Ohio campaign,
said Bush will emphasize his record, but disputed the notion that
the primary campaign has left Bush tarred as an extremist. Exit
polls from Tuesday's Ohio Republican primary show Bush did well not
just with conservatives but with all groups of voters, based on
factors such as age, income level, sex and religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has a long-standing record of being very
inclusive,'' said Paduchik.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush currently has no trips scheduled for Ohio, it will be
a ``very important state for him'' in the general election,
Paduchik said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Leland said Democrats have learned the hard way about
the dangers of being perceived as too far to the left or right.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the perception of our party from 1968 to 1992,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Paduchik, Leland said that he expects education to be a top
issue both in Ohio and nationally during the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Paduchik said Bush also will emphasize cutting taxes and
strengthening the nation's defenses. Leland said Gore's issues will
include making prescription drugs a Medicare benefit for senior
citizens.

SIGNS POINT TO NEW `SENSATION' AT THE WHITNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every couple of years the Whitney Museum of American
Art mounts its Biennial, an exhibition of new and often
cutting-edge American art.
</P>
<P>
   This year, one work may be a little too cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanitation,'' an installation by Hans Haacke, a well-known
German-born New York artist, puts Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the
company of the Nazis, with quotations by him written in the Fraktur
script favored by the Third Reich and the sound of jackboots
marching in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork, which will be on view when the 2000 Biennial opens
on March 23, recalls the fury over the First Amendment issues
raised by the ``Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of
Art last fall when the mayor attacked some of the art work as
``sick'' and ``disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   The work by Haacke was commissioned by the museum, which did not
know ahead of time exactly what he would produce.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the deliberate intent to provoke the mayor and the
public by Haacke, Maxwell L. Anderson, the museum's director, said
that the Whitney decided in the last few days to back the artist
and take its chances with City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one will hit a nerve,'' he said, ``but I have no qualms
about showing it, though on a personal level I don't share the
premise of the work, which is to liken various public officials to
Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Haacke's installation is planned around a wall lined with a row
of eight to 12 garbage cans, each with a speaker playing a tape of
marching troops. On the wall will be a reproduction of the First
Amendment framed in gold and six quotations, written in the Gothic
typescript used by Hitler, from American politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Three are from Giuliani and refer to ``Sensation,'' which
included a work that especially upset the mayor, a rendering of the
Virgin Mary by Chris Ofili that incorporated pornographic cutouts
and elephant dung. In the Haacke work, one quotation from the mayor
takes issue with the hefty subsidies given to the museum by the
city: ``We will do everything that we can to remove funding for the
Brooklyn Museum until the director comes to his senses.''
</P>
<P>
   The other quotations are from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Pat
Robertson, the conservative religious broadcaster, and Pat
Buchanan, a candidate for the Reform Party presidential nomination,
all outspoken opponents of the National Endowment for the Arts.
Helms' quote reads: ``No tax fund shall be used for garbage just
because some self-appointed `experts' have been foolish enough to
call it `art.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Wednesday that as a courtesy he was notifying
Giuliani of the Haacke work. Sunny Mindel, the mayor's spokeswoman,
said that Giuliani had not seen the work and had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Brooklyn Museum, the Whitney gets only a small amount
of monetary support from the city, mainly for its educational
programs, and it is not enough to make or break any of them,
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, however, is also intent on expanding at some point
in the next few years and would probably seek city money for
construction.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a survey show that is supposed to reflect the best of very
new art, the Biennial is one of the museum's most popular
exhibitions. It regularly makes headlines, but they are usually
complaints about the poor quality of the choices or the state of
the art world in general. This year's version was organized by a
team of six curators from institutions around the country and
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be other work in it that people will find
difficult,'' Anderson said, and the museum will hang a sign at its
entrance warning visitors that some works are challenging. Anderson
said that there would be no special signs or security measures for
the Haacke installation. ``Other works will set off bells for other
visitors, and it just becomes impossible,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Haacke work will occupy a room of its own on the third floor
of the Whitney, as the artist requested. Several other works also
have separate rooms. Like all other Biennial artworks, the Haacke
work will have a wall label, Anderson said, ``to describe the
intention of the artist as we read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those labels have not been completed, but Anderson said he wrote
a draft Wednesday for the Haacke installation saying that a common
theme of his is ``to probe the foibles and perceived hypocrisies of
the elite and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haacke is the master of figuring out how to make you squirm,''
Anderson added.
</P>
<P>
   The Biennial's curators obviously knew that last year when they
invited Haacke to participate. Like about a half-dozen other
artists, Haacke was asked simply to submit a proposal for what he
would do, pending approval by the curators.
</P>
<P>
   When the exhibition catalog went to press last fall, Haacke's
work was not fully conceived, but the curators had inklings of his
intentions then. Haacke's catalog entry refers to the ``Sensation''
furor and says, in part, ``According to the mayor, the First
Amendment and the doctrine of the separation of church and state,
embedded in the American Constitution, do not apply to public
institutions and institutions receiving public funds. He seems to
share that opinion with the Nazis, who mounted an exhibition called
Degenerate Art in Munich in 1937.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Haacke, who was born in Cologne, Germany, in 1936, studied in
the United States in the 1960s and then settled in New York. He
first gained notoriety in 1971 when the Guggenheim Museum canceled
an exhibition of his work that was to include documentation of the
real-estate holdings of New York City slumlords, including some
museum benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney did not receive Haacke's detailed proposal until
Feb. 25, Anderson said. The curators talked about the difficulties
and gave a go-ahead. Anderson said that he then discussed the work
with Leonard A. Lauder, the museum's chairman, and Joel S.
Ehrenkrantz, its president. ``Their concern was `Are we doing the
right thing?' with the controversy it will create,'' Anderson said.
But they gave their support.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the museum commissioned the work, that does not
necessarily mean that it is destined to be part of the permanent
collection. ``We often buy works from the Biennial,'' Anderson
said, ``But the collection committee will meet in spring to discuss
that.''

POLANSKI FILM SO MEDIOCRE IT'S SCARY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Roman Polanski's new demonic thriller ``The Ninth Gate'' can be
digested in one of two ways. If it's viewed as pure horror fiction
(as many critics will see it) and compared with the likes of
William Friedkin's ``The Exorcist'' and Polanski's own ``Rosemary's
Baby,'' then it's pure drivel: silly, Satanic hocus-pocus plodding
along at a snail's pace without a genuine scare in sight.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's viewed with an inner smile and compared with
pictures such as Roger Corman's Lovecraft films and Polanski's own
``The Fearless Vampire Killers,'' then it's _ well, it's still
drivel, but it's certainly much more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Depp _ in another pale, gaunt, freaky loner role _ stars
as a somewhat unscrupulous book dealer commissioned by Frank
Langella, a wealthy, eccentric collector of demonic literature
(Peter Cushing could have arm-wrestled Christopher Lee for this
part in the old days), to authenticate a tome called ``The Ninth
Gate,'' rumored to be able to raise Old Scratch himself. Of course,
the only way to be sure is to track down the two other copies in
existence, and so begins a long, tedious search that will delight
the studious few who enjoy inhaling dust in musty libraries, but
will bore everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   His quest takes him overseas through decaying gothic mansions,
winding European cobblestone streets and sprawling, opulent estates
that merely disguise the decadence within. Murder, seduction,
intrigue and near-death experiences ensue as Depp discovers more of
the books' secrets, with each new clue threatening to transform his
duties into personal obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Depp is convincingly cold and intriguing, as expected. There
will be inevitable comparisons with his recent work in ``Sleepy
Hollow,'' but Depp makes more of the part than is written, and this
is hardly a retread. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Langella's delightful overacting borders on camp _ his
confrontation with a wealthy secret society of wannabe
devil-worshipers is particularly amusing. Lena Olin gives off some
heat as the angry widow willing to do anything necessary to
retrieve the book, but her character is so underwritten she's
almost another attractive piece of the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're laughing with or laughing at Polanski's latest,
you'll still leave wondering what possessed the man who made
``Chinatown'' and ``Repulsion'' to waste his time on this piece of
supernatural fluff. Maybe the devil made him do it; let's just hope
he doesn't make him do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ninth Gate'' is rated R for violence, profanity, brief
nudity, adult subject matter. &QL;

IT MAY BE A ROUGH ROAD FOR BUSH

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush is justifiably proud that he
withstood the most spirited insurgency against a Republican
front-runner in a quarter-century and is now his party's
presumptive presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But the elation prompted by his coast-to-coast victories Tuesday
over John McCain must be tempered with the knowledge that he is in
far worse political shape nationally than when the primary process
began.
</P>
<P>
   Bush not only has lost his once-substantial national edge over
Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, but
also has seen his negative rating soar.
</P>
<P>
   True, die-hard Republicans remain enthralled with Bush. And the
ones who weren't so sure about his conservative credentials last
fall are now, in the wake of the McCain assaults, putting the Texas
governor on a pedestal only slightly below those reserved for
Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater. But, as the saying goes, where
else do they have to go?
</P>
<P>
   Bush is in trouble with the voters in the magic middle, which is
where he was headed with his ``compassionate conservative''
campaign until getting sidetracked in the snows of New Hampshire
and the false spring of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polling in state after state that voted Tuesday points to
trouble ahead for Bush as he seeks to reposition himself for the
general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a rough road.
</P>
<P>
   About 16 percent of voters in Republican primaries across the
nation Tuesday, presumably McCain supporters, said they would vote
for Gore rather than Bush in the November general election. Only
about half that many said they would vote for Democrat Gore rather
than McCain, if he were the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The continued popularity of McCain's reform agenda, especially
among independents, could put another dark cloud on Bush's horizon:
the potential re-emergence of a third presidential campaign by Ross
Perot. Most polling that has included the Dallas billionaire in a
three-way contests shows he pulls far more support from Bush than
from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Other disturbing findings for Bush along this line came in more
than 4,000 interviews with California voters as they left the
polls. The survey was conducted by Voter News Services, a
consortium operated by The Associated Press and television
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four percent of those voters identified themselves as
independents, key to any Republican hope of winning the Golden
State in the fall. McCain drew 32 percent of their votes, Gore 24
percent and Bush 21.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominously for the Texan, 40 percent of the voters
described themselves as moderates, with their votes splitting Gore
38 percent, McCain 31 percent and Bush 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that Gore has been helped by John McCain,'' said
Ed Sarpolus, a Michigan-based pollster. ``When you look at the core
swing vote, they're leaning Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 50 percent of the California voters said they were most
influenced by issues, with Gore beating Bush 36 percent to 28
percent among that group. For the 44 percent of voters more
interested in personal qualities, McCain led the field with 31
percent, but because of the margin of error he was in a statistical
tie with Bush (30 percent) and Gore (28 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The list of issues important to voters was also troubling news
for Bush. Sixty percent said Social Security and Medicare were
their top priority, with their votes going 40 percent to Gore, 26
percent to McCain and 19 percent to Bush. Only half as many voters,
30 percent, said a tax cut was the main goal for the next
president, but at least with these Bush was an easy winner, with 47
percent, compared with 22 percent for McCain and 19 percent for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And most worrisome for Bush in the state that provides 20
percent of the electoral votes needed to win the White House, was
the voters' view on whether he was knowledgeable enough to be
president: 48 percent said `yes,`` but 43 percent said ''`no.``
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about one in four voters said Bush did not have the
knowledge needed to serve effectively as president, according to an
AP review of the polling, with some states reaching California-like
levels, including more than 40 percent in Massachusetts and Vermont
saying ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, naturally, says he doesn't know what folks are talking
about when they ask whether he's moved too far to the right in the
primaries. But just compare where the Bush campaign thought it
would be once the nomination was in hand with where the Texan's
effort is now that he is on the cusp of claiming the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had planned to spend the next four-plus months jetting
around the nation visiting his fellow Republican governor-pals and
showcasing what he contends are his Texas successes that are ready
for national export: education and welfare reform chief among them.
And he would continue to hammer away at the need for a huge tax
cut, not because it's popular, as he says, but because it's the
right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   As the primaries _ and constant polling throughout the period _
have shown, Bush's tax cut plan is not that popular, with
Republicans or, even more noticeably, with independents.
</P>
<P>
   In several key states that voted Tuesday, exit poll interviews
with Republican voters found that ``moral issues'' were the key
concern for the upcoming national administration, often coming in
at twice the percentage of taxes or even Social Security and
Medicare.

 ANALYSIS: BUSH MUST WIN OVER McCAIN VOTERS, BUT IT WON'T BE EASY  
 (bl)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has a mighty mountain to climb if
he is to persuade supporters of his vanquished rival, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, to back him in November against Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the significant findings of voter surveys
conducted in several states Tuesday by a consortium of television
networks and The Associated Press. It suggested that the governor
would do well to seek a quick rapprochement with McCain in the hope
that the senator, who stresses his staunch Republicanism, could
rally his backers against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mardi Gras voting in 13 states, McCain was punished for
his Johnny-one-note campaign. His focus on campaign finance reform
clearly appealed to fewer primary and caucus voters than Bush's
emphasis on a variety of issues, and he suffered from the Texan's
media blitzes. Still, his supporters backed him passionately and
will switch reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   The potential is there for the Texas governor, at least in
California: Bush and McCain together polled 51 percent on the
state's ``bedsheet'' ballot, which listed all candidates of all
parties, compared with 42 percent for Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bush served notice Tuesday in a victory statement in Austin,
Texas, that he would do all he could to link Gore with President
Clinton, wrap them together with a blue ribbon, and run against the
vice president as if he were the president. He used the phrase
``Clinton-Gore administration,'' or a variant, no fewer than six
times in a relatively brief speech.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, the nation's most populous state, which Gore
has always described as essential to his presidential hopes, more
than half of McCain's supporters, 53 percent, said they approved of
Clinton's performance as president. Almost three-quarters of Bush's
backers, 71 percent, said they disapproved of what Clinton had
done.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity was partly explained by the fact that only 46
percent of those who voted for McCain in Tuesday's all-comers
primary in the state were Republicans; 33 percent were
independents, 21 percent were Democrats. Explained, but not robbed
of significance, because Bush needs to convert McCain backers of
whatever partisan stripe and not just Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a plurality of McCain voters in California, 41
percent, said they found Bush too conservative, despite the Texan's
proclamation that he wanted ``a party of inclusion, a party with a
generous heart and an open door.'' In a reflection of the
bitterness of the later stages of the primary campaign, only 4
percent of them said that Bush says what he means; an additional 4
percent said both Bush and McCain do so.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Bush make the kind of impact he had hoped to on the
state's big Hispanic electorate. He speaks fluent Spanish, and used
that to good effect in appealing to Spanish-speaking voters in two
successful campaigns for governor; in 1998, he took more than a
third of the Hispanic votes.
</P>
<P>
   In California, however, he was swimming upstream. Hispanic
voters there resent many of the actions and policies of former Gov.
Pete Wilson, a Republican, and they helped elect a Democrat, Gray
Davis, to succeed him. Bush was unable to counter the ``Wilson
effect''; Hispanic voters constituted 13 percent of the California
electorate, and Bush won the backing of a mere 18 percent of them,
compared with 56 percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where only registered Republicans were permitted to
vote in the Republican primary, few Hispanics did so. Those that
did preferred Bush to McCain, but there was no way to tell whether
Hispanics in any significant numbers would consider defecting from
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   There was an important racial component in Gore's strong
California showing, which offered a preview _ an early, tentative
preview, subject to radical change, but a preview nonetheless _ of
the fall election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did much better than Bush among women, for example, taking
38 percent to Bush's 28 percent. But that entire margin and more
was accounted for by black and Hispanic women; among white women,
Bush prevailed, 33 percent to 29 percent. Likewise, Gore did better
than Bush among Catholic voters, helped considerably by nonwhite
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Bush's strategists took considerable comfort from one
statistic in California: the fact that McCain voters, like Bush's
supporters, expressed strong disapproval of Clinton as a person, as
contrasted to their favorable opinion of his performance as
president. The governor clearly intends to accuse Gore of faulty
moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will repair the broken bonds of trust between Americans and
their government,'' Bush said Tuesday, adding later: ``I believe
this great country of ours is ready to return exiled honor to the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone think he was talking only about Clinton, he
appropriated an unfortunate phrase of Gore's and turned it against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will remind Al Gore,'' he said, ``that Americans do not want
a White House where there is `no controlling legal authority,'''
echoing the justification used by the vice president for
fund-raising calls from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could seek to win over the McCain voters who are suspicious
of him by agreeing to incorporate language on campaign finance
acceptable to the senator in the Republican platform. He could make
a deal on the vice presidential nomination, turning perhaps to
someone like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania _ a Vietnam veteran, a
moderate with experience both on Capitol Hill and, of course, in
state government, a moderate who, like McCain, appeals to
moderates, but a far more conciliatory man than the sometimes
bellicose Arizonan. One problem: Ridge backs abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The situation facing Bush is not unlike that faced in 1960 by
Vice President Richard M. Nixon, when he was harried for weeks by
the favorite of liberal Republicans, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of
New York. Rockefeller accused Nixon and the Republicans of seeking
to ``meet the future with a banner aloft whose only emblem is a
question mark,'' and called for party reform.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Nixon, by then assured of the nomination, flew to New
York and met with Rockefeller. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade
Rockefeller to accept the vice presidential nomination. Then the
two turned to domestic and foreign policy issues and bargained hard
for six hours.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the fleetingly famous and highly controversial
Compact of Fifth Avenue, so-called after the location of
Rockefeller's apartment. Many conservatives reacted furiously to
it, comparing Nixon's behavior with that of Neville Chamberlain's
appeasement of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it helped Nixon win independent votes in the
fall _ not quite enough to beat John F. Kennedy, but enough to come
very close.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This fall, independent votes, which have gone disproportionately
so far to McCain, will be vital in the big swing states like New
York, California, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Bush seems to have the
South under firm control, but that is not enough.

<P>
   KAZAN, Russia _ The last time this city's white-walled fortress
fell to Moscow was in 1552, when Ivan the Terrible defeated the
powerful Tatar khanate of Kazan. Now Tatarstan _ one of the 89
regions in Russia's awkward and disjointed federation _ is under
siege again, this time by Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the acting president and the clear favorite in the March
26 presidential election, keeps hammering away at variations of a
single theme: the urgent need to restore the authority of a strong
central government in Russia and bring its far-flung, free-wheeling
regions to heel.
</P>
<P>
   The message has not been lost here and in other regional
capitals where for the last 10 years local leaders have grown used
to doing things their own way, sometimes with the consent of
Moscow, sometimes without. Except for Chechnya, the southern
republic now flattened by war, no other region has pulled harder at
Moscow's leash than Tatarstan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 _ even before Boris Yeltsin, campaigning to become
Russia's first president, urged the regions to assume as much
sovereignty as they could ``swallow'' _ Tatarstan and its majority
Muslim Tatars was already leading the pack. It declared
sovereignty, laid claim to the considerable oil wealth beneath its
soil and draped itself in all the trappings of statehood, from flag
to hymn to its own national day.
</P>
<P>
   And like many of Russia's other 89 regions, Tatarstan has often
set itself above Russian law. Going beyond its prerogatives under
Russia's tax code, the republic has added taxes of its own, to the
fury of local businesses. It has imposed restrictions on food
stuffs crossing its borders into neighboring regions. Its election
laws and practices make a mockery of democracy, according to a
lawsuit brought by a local journalist after a close analysis of a
series of strangely skewered election results.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, many residents complain that they are living
not in a modern state but in a feudal society where the ruling
clan, led by President Mintimer Shaimiyev, has a lock not only on
government, but on an economy that somehow missed the boat when
Russia went headlong into a free market.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has vowed to put a stop to such free-lance federalism.
Speaking last month to law students in Siberia, he called for a
return to longstanding Russian traditions. ``Russia was created as
a centralized state, and it has existed exactly this way,'' he
said. ``Thus, we had czarism, then Communism, and now the president
has appeared, the institution of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaimiyev, a wily realist and above all a survivor, has taken
the hint and is careful not to disagree with Putin. But he says he
wants to be sure that Putin's strong state does not exclude the
political process, with its usual give and take.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does strong authority mean in the conditions of
democratic development of the country and the market economy,''
Shaimiyev asked in a recent interview. ``If it means observance of
people's rights and freedoms and guarantee of civil ownership, then
I agree we need strong authority. But if it is seen as giving
orders from the top, well, that is utopia, and then there is no
further need for reform in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaimiyev has been at his job for 12 years. In that time, he has
managed to ride out every one of Russia's crises including those _
like the 1991 Communist-backed coup and the recent ill-fated
opposition party led by former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov _ in
which he backed the losing side.
</P>
<P>
   In the parliamentary elections last December, Tatarstan voters,
loyally following their leader's advice, backed Primakov's party.
On March 26, Shaimiyev predicts, they will follow him just as
loyally onto the Putin bandwagon, which he joined with unabashed
alacrity once it became apparent that the acting president was a
sure winner.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed in Russia since last fall, when Shaimiyev and
other regional bosses were able to throw their weight around and
dictate the terms of their support. ``Now, the issue is not how
much regional leaders will be able to get from the center, but
about how much they can avoid losing,'' said Nikolai Petrov, an
analyst at the Moscow office of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regional leaders are very afraid of Putin,'' said Yelena
Mizulina, a parliamentary deputy from the ancient Russian city of
Yaroslavl. ``He will pressure them _ and that is a good thing for
Russia _ but the key test will be how he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has already begun to tighten control. Moving quickly after
Yeltsin's sudden resignation on Dec. 31, he has replaced about
one-fourth of the presidential representatives in the regions _
officials assigned to enforce federal authority but who, in
reality, were often beholden to regional leaders during the Yeltsin
era. In at least two cases, Putin's appointees were former chiefs
of the local FSB, the security service that he once headed.
</P>
<P>
   Few people dispute the need to tidy up the relationship between
Russia's regions and the central government, to bring local laws
into conformity with federal laws. And most agree that these issues
would have come to a head this year, regardless of who succeeded
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say for certain that no unified system of power exists
in Russia today,'' Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the upper chamber of
parliament, where regional leaders have ex officio seats, said in a
recent interview in the newspaper Izvestia. ``All there is the
framework of power.''
</P>
<P>
   After the election, Putin may take even bolder steps. Plans now
being floated by his supporters include a proposal to group the
regions in larger, more manageable super-provinces _ perhaps
corresponding to eight existing interregional associations or to
the ``guberniye'' that existed in czarist times. Another proposal
calls for Moscow to appoint most regional governors, rather than
have them elected locally, with the exception of some sensitive
regions, like the two metropolises of Moscow and St. Petersburg,
and the so-called national republics, like Tatarstan, that are home
to non-Russian ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes would require constitutional amendments and a
political consensus that is lacking. Few expect Putin to start a
costly and even dangerous political clash with regional leaders any
time soon. But some analysts note that these proposals give a sense
of the direction of Putin's own thinking about the future shape of
Russia.

</P>
<P>
   Here in Tatarstan, Shaimiyev presides like a latter-day khan,
ruling from a sumptuously renovated palace inside the local
Kremlin's walled enclave, hard by a giant new mosque that rivals
the largest of Kazan's Orthodox churches.
</P>
<P>
   As leader of this republic of 3.7 million, most of them, like
himself, Muslim Tatars, Shaimiyev's rule is unchallenged, although
not as ham-handed as the president of neighboring Bashkortostan,
who routinely oversteps basic democratic norms.
</P>
<P>
   In Tatarstan, the state council, or Legislature, is firmly in
the president's pocket, with two-thirds of its seats filled with
his appointees, from local administration heads to the prime
minister to directors of state-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
   The local economy looks much like it did in Soviet times.
Tatneft, the local oil company that is the source of much of the
republic's wealth, is publicly traded, but firmly under the
regional government's control, as are all its major petrochemical
factories.
</P>
<P>
   In much of this, the Shaimiyev family has kept a hand, giving
rise to a local joke that Tatarstan's democracy is guaranteed by
the fact that the president has two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Shaimiyev, who has both the easy charm and political acuity of
the boss of a big-city political machine, makes no apologies for
having taken Yeltsin at his word on the offer of unlimited
sovereignty, even when it meant flouting the Russian Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he noted, Tatarstan was seething with Tatar
nationalist sentiment. Later, when Chechnya pursued an outright
separatist course, many were to praise both Yeltsin and Shaimiyev
for having found a viable _ if messy _ political solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both, Yeltsin and I, knew about the discrepancies in the
laws,'' Shaimiyev said. ``But such was life back then. We had to
calm the people down; the people of Tatarstan were demanding
independence. Yeltsin could see it with his own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   At every step, Tatarstan took the lead in stretching, straining
and twisting Russia's federal relationships. Its unilateral
declaration of sovereignty was issued one year before Yeltsin
uttered his famous phrase. In 1994, it was the first of Russia's
regions to negotiate a bilateral treaty with Moscow, which, in
time, became the model for some 40 such treaties signed by other
Russian regions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a new era dawning, Tatarstan is likely to have to roll
back its claims to sovereignty, said Lev Ovrutsky, a journalist
based in Kazan.

   ``From the beginning, Tatarstan was the pioneer,'' he said. ``It
was the first to get results with its declaration of sovereignty,
and now it will be the first to make corrections.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   As the rumblings from Moscow become more distinct, people here
are divided about what Putin's ``strong state'' will mean to them.
For five years, Tatarstan has been able to keep half of its federal
tax revenues, an arrangement heavily criticized in Moscow but
widely applauded here, where the standard of living is among the
highest in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Many Tatars, who take pride in their republic's quasisovereign
status, fear that Putin's strong words will usher in a new era of
Russian chauvinism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new political regime in Moscow will be extremely
authoritarian, and it will lead to a taking away of the rights that
have been won by Tatarstan,'' said Damir Iskhakov, a historian and
founding member of the Tatarstan Social Center, which played a key
role in the Tatar nationalist movement of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But paradoxically, Iskhakov said, some Tatar nationalists
support a greater role for the federal government on the theory
that it will be less selfish, and less narrow in its distribution
of power and resources than the current local elite.
</P>
<P>
   Many local entrepreneurs, both Russian and Tatar, are also
looking to the federal government to loosen the stranglehold on
private business now held by regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local authorities want money, but mostly they want to
control things,'' said Valery Khubulav, executive director of Zarya
Confectionary, a privatized company.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Tatyanchikov, a businessman and leader of the local
branch of the Union of Right Forces, a party of free-market
advocates, recently founded a club of like-minded young
entrepreneurs who want to see change come to Tatarstan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking for another revolution, `' Tatyanchikov
said. ``What we want is for the government to follow the law. We
want an even playing field, with one set of rules. We have already
gone through a series of crises _ high inflation, high interest
rates, the crash of the ruble _ and we adjusted to all of it. Now
we are tired, and we want this craziness to end.''

CLINTON SENDS TO A WARY CONGRESS A LONG-DELAYED CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Recasts 2nd graf to make reference to Taiwan and to change
wording from deal to legislation.) 
(jt) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Wednesday sent Congress his bill
to usher China into the World Trade Organization. He then opened a
new front in the debate on the subject in his own party, arguing
that opening China's markets will undermine Communist Party
control.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the Johns Hopkins University's foreign affairs
graduate school here, Clinton tried to float above the bitter
economic debate in his party about the wisdom of the legislation,
and he said little about Taiwan, whose relations with China have
been flaring up.
</P>
<P>
   But he made an argument that opening up China's economy amounted
to a poison pill for China's Communist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and
cable modem,'' Clinton told a crowd that included students,
lobbyists and many members of Clinton's cabinet, who are now
calling members of Congress daily about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   When it joins the Geneva-based trade organization, the president
said, China will be obliged to make ``the tools of communication
even cheaper, better and more widely available. We know how much
the Internet has changed America, and we are already an open
society. Imagine how much it could change China.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that since the deal was signed four months
ago, China's leaders have tried to control both what kind of
content Chinese can access via the Internet, and to prevent foreign
ownership of Internet-related companies. But to the Chinese leaders
who are trying to control the Internet in a country as vast and
hard to police as China, he said he had only two words: ``Good
luck!''
</P>
<P>
   The long-delayed transmission of the bill to Congress _ it
appeared timed to arrive after Vice President Gore had the
Democratic presidential nomination firmly in grasp _ set off a
battle within the Democratic party that intertwines the politics of
trade, the presidential election and Clinton's final effort to
recast relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's prospects are unclear. Only 50 to 60
Democratic members of the House appear ready to support the bill,
which would grant permanent ``normal'' trade status to China. That
is the one legal prerequisite that would let American companies
benefit from market openings China promised in 13 years of
negotiations that ended in November.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Clinton is dependent on support from House and
Senate Republicans to pass what may be the last major foreign
policy legislation of his presidency. Senate passage is thought
likely. But the vote in the House is expected to be very close. By
most estimates, President Clinton would have to win over at least
20 more Democrats in the House to secure passage.
</P>
<P>
   He is getting little help from Vice President Gore, who, to
appease labor unions that vociferously oppose the deal, said three
weeks ago that he would negotiate something better if elected to
office. Gore later reiterated his support for the deal the
administration struck, but his aides did not return calls on the
subject Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the presumed Republican nominee,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, said Bush remains a ``vocal
supporter'' of China's entry into the trade organization, because
``it is in our interest, and it is in the interest of the Chinese
to grow an entrepreneurial middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the governor did not yet have a position on tying
passage of the bill to providing new arms for Taiwan, a movement
that several Republicans are considering as the price for their
support.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced Wednesday by Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the
Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. But
Wolfowitz, who is one of Governor Bush's leading foreign policy
advisers, did not mention that Bush has been more vocal in his
support of the bill than Clinton's own vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's argument Wednesday that entry to the regulatory body
would loosen the hold of China's Communist leaders is bound to set
off considerable debate, because it is far from clear that China's
economic openings have been matched by a political relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made essentially the same argument in 1994 when he
reversed himself, and said that despite his campaign promises he
would no longer link the annual renewal of Chinese trade benefits
to its human rights record. Over time, he said, trade would
contribute to a lifting of political repression.
</P>
<P>
   But in the six years since then, according to the annual reports
published by the State Department, China's rights record has
worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risky argument because it leaves him vulnerable to the
charge that he's overplaying what this agreement will do in
China,'' said Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings
Institution. ``It was a good speech, but there may have been too
much emphasis on what this will do to change China rather than why
it's in the national interests of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton spoke, his advisers foresaw a fierce battle in
Congress, where they are trying to win passage by mid-May, before
the congressional elections heat up. And Wednesday Clinton lost a
major ally: Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., who is influential with his
colleagues on military issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his colleagues, Murtha, who has consistently
voted to renew China's trading rights with the United States, said
he now believes it would be a mistake to lose the leverage of an
annual vote.
</P>
<P>
   He said his mind was made up when China threatened ``drastic
measures'' and ``the use of force'' against Taiwan if it was found
to be indefinitely delaying unification talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in our national security interest,'' he concluded,
``to condone and reward grossly irresponsible conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has been meeting with members of Congress for
several weeks to press his case, Democratic and Republican leaders
on Capitol Hill have complained that the White House was running
out of time _ and needed to send up a bill. Sen. Daniel P.
Moynihan, D-N.Y., and a supporter of permanent normal trade
relations, a status that most nations enjoy, complained two weeks
ago that the White House was running out of time.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly part of that hesitation was the pressure on Vice
President Gore. But now some White House officials say they hope he
will strengthen his support, even if it means angering unions.
``Where is the AFL-CIO going to run?'' one cabinet member said
Wednesday. ``To George Bush?''
</P>
<P>
   But the big issue is the Democratic members of Congress, who are
caught between labor, which vows to defeat anyone supporting the
bill, and business interests, which are organizing an advertising
campaign for it. That effort is led by agricultural and technology
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, China is nervous that the bill will fail, and Chinese
officials have begun an unusual lobbying campaign. One senior
administration official this week said he feared that ``China's own
efforts could backfire on us big time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton Wednesday that even if Congress votes against normal
trade relations, China will still get into the world body.
</P>
<P>
   A vote against the bill, Clinton said, ``will cost America jobs
as our competitors in Europe, Asia and elsewhere capture Chinese
markets that we otherwise would have served.''

CHINA PUTS TROOPS ON ALERT, IN CAMPAIGN AIMED AT TAIWAN'S
ELECTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan _ With Taiwan's presidential election only 10
days away, China has uncorked its vitriol on the Democratic
Progressive Party candidate, Chen Shui-bian, calling him a
separatist and a silver-tongued liar. To hear Chen tell it, Beijing
is doing him a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a precedent here,'' he said in an interview during a
campaign swing that took him from Taipei to this southern port
city. ``The person China hates, Taiwan voters love.''
</P>
<P>
   When Beijing fired missiles into the ocean near Taiwan before
the 1996 election, hoping to scare people away from President Lee
Teng-hui, they responded by re-electing him in a landslide. Chen,
who is viewed as less acceptable to Beijing than either of his two
main rivals, said China's latest barrage of threats would play to
his advantage as well by raising the hackles of voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen Shui-bian is not Lee Teng-hui, and this is not 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with party officials, political analysts and voters
this week suggest that Chen's identification with the cause of
Taiwanese independence could hurt him, particularly among the
one-quarter of the electorate that is still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Chen is running neck-and-neck with Vice President Lien Chan and
James Soong, an independent. Chen's campaign manager figures the
election will hinge on 200,000 to 300,000 voters, who may not make
up their minds until they step into the polling booth.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, these people are being subjected to a daily
drumbeat from Beijing. On Monday, the Chinese army accused a
``prominent figure'' _ read Chen Shui-bian _ of pushing for
independence and said it had put its troops on alert to crush such
a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under no circumstances should we be fooled by his sweet
talk,'' said the army's newspaper, Liberation Army Daily, in a
front-page editorial. ``One minute he is brazenly howling `Long
live Taiwan independence,' while the next he is using beautiful and
pleasant words to lie that he wants `good will, reconciliation,
vigorous cooperation and everlasting peace' with the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Beijing, President Jiang Zemin told a group of
foreign journalists, ``If you seek Taiwan independence, it will be
a case of brother fighting brother.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those who is listening is Chen Yen-yang, 22, a political
science student at National Taiwan University. Chen, who will cast
his first vote in this election, said he always assumed he would
support Chen Shui-bian. But he starts compulsory military service
next year. That has changed his mind, and he now plans to vote for
Vice President Lien of the governing Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody around me, my family and friends, is talking about
the possibility of war between Taiwan and China,'' Chen said. ``I
can't ignore that.''
</P>
<P>
   His classmate, Chen Yu-wen, said, ``I think Chen Shui-bian
underestimates China's willingness to take military action against
Taiwan.'' She said she planned to vote for Lien because the
Nationalist Party ``understands China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to deal with them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's rivals have seized the chance to portray him as a threat
to peace. The Nationalists are running a newspaper advertisement
that shows a man in army fatigues, his face hidden by a black gas
mask, staring into a wall of flames. The figure represents Taiwan
in the aftermath of a Chen victory.
</P>
<P>
   Chen counters these charges by noting he is the only candidate
with a son who would be drafted into the military if Taiwan were
invaded by China. ``As a father, I understand the fear of parents
who don't want to put their children into danger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his zeal to appear moderate, Chen rivals even the
hyper-cautious Lien. If elected, he has pledged not to declare
independence, not to hold a referendum on the issue, and not to put
the phrase ``special state-to-state'' relations into Taiwan's
Constitution. Those words, which Lee uttered last July, infuriated
China and set off a war of words across the Strait of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Chen is the platform of the Democratic
Progressive Party, which calls for ``the establishment of a
sovereign and independent Republic of Taiwan.'' Chen insisted
Wednesday that such a move would come only after a plebiscite, the
timing of which would be up to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts dismissed Chen's more conciliatory tone
as a political ploy rather than a shift in his bedrock beliefs.
They said the fervor of 1996 _ in which Taiwanese people rose up to
defend their first native-born president _ was missing from this
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this country are no longer fanatical,'' said Wang
Jin-pyng, a Nationalist Party stalwart who is the president of
Taiwan's legislature. ``They believe that maintenance of stability
is the best policy. If the threats from China reduce Chen's support
by 3 percent, he will lose the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaohsiung is one of Chen's strongholds, and Wednesday night
thousands of his supporters turned out here for an earsplitting,
and defiant, rally.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Chia-shin, 27, who has a mix of mainland Chinese and native
Taiwanese roots, said she was supporting Chen: ``I like his humble
background,'' she said. ``I'm from a humble background too. People
would say I'm a nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who brought her 6-year-old daughter, said she did not worry
about China's hostility. ``China is not having any impact on my
decision,'' she said. ``I think Chen Shui-bian will be flexible
enough to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheng Wen-shiung, a 47-year-old tailor, said the threats from
China would not intimidate him. ``We Taiwanese have the courage to
repel any invader,'' he said. But he added, ``Of course, some
people won't vote for Chen because of China.''

`MISSION' ACCOMPLISHES ITS GOAL: ROLLICKING ADVENTURE
</HEADLINE>
 TO MARS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The previews for ``Mission to Mars'' are deceptive: They make it
look as if director Brian De Palma is ripping off ``2001: A Space
Odyssey.'' In reality he's ripping off virtually every
space-exploration movie of the past 50 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This turns out to be OK, though, because what De Palma is really
doing is paying tribute to old science-fiction movie serials, which
formed the roots of all the other movies De Palma steals from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tribute'' is one of those words people use when a ripoff is
entertaining, and ``Mission to Mars'' succeeds enough in that
department to make up for its myriad flaws, which include slow
pacing (unusual for De Palma), a wordy script, cardboard
characters, questionable science and a climax that a lot of people
will find way too touchy-feely. When De Palma meets the New Age,
it's a lot like the old age, but he punctuates the movie well,
giving us an action/suspense sequence every 20 minutes or so to
keep us watching.
</P>
<P>
   The movie introduces us to its characters quickly, with an
Apollo 13-style family barbecue. Woody and Terri (Tim Robbins and
Connie Nielsen) are cutesy husband-and-wife astronauts headed for a
Mars mission; their buddy Jim (Gary Sinise) lost his chance to go
when his wife (''NYPD Blue's'' Kim Delaney, seen in flashbacks)
died of some debilitating disease. Their other buddy, Luke (Don
Cheadle), gets to go in his place _ and he and his crew eventually
encounter what could best be described as an angry, carnivorous
Martian sandstorm.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems unfair that Sinise has to play the guy left behind
again, as he did in ``Apollo 13,'' just wait. his Jim gets to go on
a rescue mission, with Woody, Terri and comic-relief goofball Phil
(''Scream 2's'' Jerry O'Connell), and they encounter perils and
make discoveries of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Although De Palma is much admired as a craftsman, he is, in his
own way, just as much an actor's director. He tends to work best
when his movies have a well-defined lead player, whether it be
Sissy Spacek in ``Carrie'' or Nicolas Cage in ``Snake Eyes.''
Because ``Mission to Mars'' is more of an ensemble piece, De Palma
doesn't have as much of a grip, and vibrant actors such as Sinise,
Cheadle and Robbins look just the slightest bit lost. This may be a
result of the multiple-writer story and screenplay, which appears
determined to give all the main characters equal dialogue time, so
that nobody really stands out as first among equals, a Tom Hanks
did in ``Apollo 13.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't matter; this isn't the type of movie you go to
for acting or plot. You go so that you can murmur ``cool'' to
yourself when De Palma and his crew come up with some new
eye-popping computer-generated effect (at times it seems like it
should have been an IMAX movie). And the actors' work looks better
when you realize that they probably did most of it before blue
screens, with effects added later. Because they're often confined
to their spacesuits, however, the movie occasionally begins
sounding like a radio play.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Mission'' lags, you can amuse yourself by counting all
the movie references De Palma has sprinkled throughout as if it
were a cinematic Where's Waldo? He can be so unabashedly derivative
that he's probably started borrowing stuff without even meaning to.
It also helps to think of ``Mission'' as what it is: a PG movie
aimed squarely at space geeks from junior high on up. They might be
the pickiest about its weird science, but they shouldn't let that
get in the way of its entertaining aspects. It's the most
thoughtful mindless movie to come along in some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars'' is rated PG for violence and scattered
profanity. &QL;

 McCAIN APPEARS READY TO END CAMPAIGN  
(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ After a day huddled at his vacation cabin with
family and senior aides, Sen. John McCain appeared ready to end his
maverick candidacy, canceling several days worth of appearances in
Colorado and Illinois and scheduling what his aides called ``a
major announcement'' for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed a day of discussions on his options
that aides had earlier said would focus on how the senator could
force the Republican party to embrace his reform agenda, most
particularly some form of campaign finance overhaul which was at
the center of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire is to make clear in departure _ if that is what it
is _ that he is serious about reform and his voters are serious
about reform,'' said an adviser. ``And the party in order to win
and pick up his voters is going to have to move that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent supporters said that they had urged McCain to
end his insurgent candidacy within days. But some of his aides were
still defiant on Wednesday morning. Before meeting with the
senator, some of his campaign advisers dropped hints of how
McCain's delegates could disrupt the Republican National Convention
this summer by forcing roll-call votes on his proposals or by
putting McCain's name into nomination, guaranteeing him a prime
speaking platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will assess the campaign and the status of the campaign and
the reform movement he so cares about,'' John Weaver, McCain's
political director, said as he headed to McCain's vacation home.
``The options are obvious. Stay in. Get out. Or other options,'' he
added elliptically, referring to a third party bid.
</P>
<P>
   But other advisers said they thought McCain should be taken at
his word that he would be loyal to the party and by Wednesday night
it looked like he was ready to withdraw. Todd Harris, a campaign
spokesman, declined, however, to say what McCain would announce.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain met with his aides, Gov. George W. Bush was clearly
eager on Wednesday to move onto the general election battle against
Vice President Al Gore and indicated that he was prepared to paint
him as a partner in the ethical embarrassments and moral lapses of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up where his victory speech on Tuesday night left off,
Bush said in Austin, Texas, ``If people are happy with Al Gore and
Bill Clinton, the tone they set for America, then you've got a
perfect person to vote for.'' Bush was speaking of Gore, and with
palpable derision.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference in the garden of the Governor's
Mansion, Bush said of his Republican rival that ``John is going to
decide whether he's going to continue on and it's his choice. My
main opponent in this campaign will be Al Gore and our differences
will be stark.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of Bush's supporters in the Senate reached out to McCain's
allies in the hope of healing any rift between the Republican
rivals, enlisting the senator's cooperation for the general
election and uniting the party as best possible.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain signaled in his concession speech Tuesday night that
his wholehearted cooperation with Bush would likely come with a
price when he said, ``Our crusade continues tonight, tomorrow, the
next day, the day after that and for as long as it takes to restore
America's confidence and pride in the practice and institutions of
our great democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of McCain said that Kenneth Duberstein, a former
White House chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan, and Sen.
Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., were relaying word to Bush's allies that the
governor had to take the initial step to heal the breach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that Governor Bush is going to need Senator
McCain, not just for John McCain, but for who and what John McCain
represents,'' Hagel said. ``He represents reform as much as any one
dynamic of who McCain is. John McCain is going to want to have a
voice in helping shape a reform agenda in the Republican Party as
we go into the election in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two of them will have to have a conversation about this
and about campaign finance's priority on a Bush agenda,'' Hagel
said. ``What I'm saying is that a reform agenda will have to be
there for McCain to get enthusiastically engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel emphasized that while he and McCain have talked several
times a day for the past several days, they have not discussed
whether McCain's support for Bush would be conditioned on his
stance toward campaign finance reform.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Bush triumphed over McCain from coast to coast except in
New England on Tuesday, he goes into the general election in a less
commanding position than Gore because he had to turn to the right
to defeat his rival. That has carried a political cost.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's victory in the critical general election state of
California, for example, exit polls showed Bush's win depended on
Republicans. He ran far behind both Gore and McCain among such
critical swing groups as independents and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   A joint front with McCain could help Bush repair some of the

into the primaries. But several aides or advisers to Bush said that
the Texas governor was not offering up specific changes in his
position on overhauling campaign finance regulations simply to
placate McCain.

3 WESTERN STATES TO HAVE THEIR SAY, FAINTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Story was previously skedded as MCCAIN-COLO) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The effort began three years ago as a way to give the
West a little influence in the presidential selection process. Gov.
Michael O. Leavitt of Utah led a vigorous bipartisan campaign to
create a Western primary day for the eight states just this side of
California.
</P>
<P>
   It never worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Any impact the region might have gained seemed to dissipate when
only Colorado, Utah and Wyoming agreed to schedule voting on the
same day _ Friday. And now that Tuesday's results in 16 other
states have all but assured Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas their parties' nominations, the drama seems
removed altogether, even though Bush was scheduled to be in Denver
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Sen. John McCain canceled his scheduled
appearances in Denver on Thursday and Colorado Springs on Friday,
and seemed about to announce his withdrawal from the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice of the West is going to be heard if only faintly,''
said Leavitt, a strong Bush supporter, arguing that victories by
Bush would increase his momentum going into the Southern primaries
next week. ``Is that relevancy? Yeah, I think that makes Friday
relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   As winner in all but four of the 10 Republican contests on
Tuesday, Bush was leaving nothing to chance. He planned to sweep
through the region on Thursday, with a rally at the Denver Broncos'
training center outside Denver in the morning, followed by
appearances at the Provo, Utah, airport and the Cheyenne Civic
Center in Wyoming's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a lot of phone calls,'' said Gov. Bill Owens of
Colorado, a Republican who has been working his state hard for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Freda Poundstone, who became the state coordinator several days
ago, said Wednesday that she had waited much of the day to hear
whether she should round up supporters to attend the scheduled
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have thousands of volunteers climbing the walls here,'' she
said before the cancellations. ``They would love to have him come.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's prospects in Colorado seemed bleak even before
Tuesday's voting. A statewide poll for The Denver Post published on
Sunday found that among 249 registered Republican voters, 55
percent preferred Bush as the party nominee to 29 percent for
McCain. Sixteen percent favored other candidates or said they were
uncertain. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 6.2
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the three Western states for the Republicans are 91
delegates _ 40 in Colorado, 29 in Utah and 22 in Wyoming, which is
holding county caucuses to select half its delegates to the
national convention. The other half will be chosen at a state
Republican convention in June.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose path to the nomination is virtually clear after a
sweep of the 11 Democratic contests on Tuesday, has no plans to
visit any of the three states before the voting on Friday. He
appeared at a rally in Denver last week and has little to gain in
Utah and Wyoming, which have longstanding Republican traditions and
only a few electoral votes to offer, eight between them.

 &HT;    City at odds over Confederate general
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Driving along Monument Avenue, past the massive
stone statues of Robert E. Lee and other Confederate warriors,
Charles Chambliss said in disgust, ``Somehow the Confederacy made
the losers look honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, more than 500 patrons of the Museum of the
Confederacy will, in fact, gather to salute Lee. They'll attend the
museum's Grand Southern Ball, a fund-raiser selling, among other
memorabilia, baseball caps inscribed with Lee's signature for $15
each.
</P>
<P>
   Though dead since 1870, five years after his surrender at
Appomattox, Va., ended the Civil War, the Confederate
general-in-chief is at the center of controversy. In recent weeks,
a downtown mural of Lee has been torched and his reputation
defended in a dispute over how history should be marked here in the
capital of the Old Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fight that heritage groups say embodies a resolve by
civil rights leaders to rid the South of Confederate symbols _
including the Rebel banner flying atop the South Carolina
Statehouse and embodied in the state flags of Georgia and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Richmond, a bastion of Confederate relics and
remembrances, a growing chorus, including Mayor Timothy Kaine, says
it's time for the majority black city to honor African-Americans.
Or, just as importantly, some say it's appropriate to recognize the
misery of the half a million African slaves who were bought and
sold along the James River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one more dime should be spent on another Confederate
rendering until African-American personalities and heroes are
included in some kind of plan to accurately and fairly present
history on public property,'' Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
   As a black lawyer practicing in Richmond since 1978, Chambliss,
52, fought on behalf of erecting a statue on Monument Avenue
honoring Richmond native and African-American tennis great Arthur
Ashe. It was raised in 1996, despite protests by heritage groups
that the stately boulevard was hollowed ground of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chambliss is in position to wield even greater influence.
</P>
<P>
   He is chairman of the city's ad hoc historical interpretation
committee, created by the City Council to advise it on how to
reflect history in the naming of monuments, bridges and other
public property.
</P>
<P>
   The committee plans its second meeting March 23, hoping to agree
on a plan that will avoid a replay of the nasty fight over the Ashe
monument and, last month, over the renaming of two city bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council renamed the bridges in honor of two Richmond
civil rights leaders, Samuel Tucker and Curtis Holt. Their names
replaced those of Confederate generals J.E.B. Stuart and Stonewall
Jackson, who also are honored by Monument Avenue statues.
</P>
<P>
   The most protracted fight has been over Lee, whose statue is the
biggest and most ornate along Monument Avenue, reflecting adoration
that is now being challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is historical fact about Robert E. Lee,'' said William
Martin, director of Richmond's Valentine Museum. ``But rather than
deal with Lee as a person, we deal with him as a symbol.'' Last
spring, the foundation redeveloping Richmond's waterfront sparked
controversy when it hoisted a mural-sized portrait of Lee in his
uniform. Richmond City Councilman Sa'ad El-Amin protested,
comparing Lee to Nazi leaders and expressing a view simmering under
the surface in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin said the city's Confederate monuments, erected in an era
when white people controlled city government, are offensive to many
black people.
</P>
<P>
   The Historic Richmond Riverfront Foundation removed the mural,
part of a pictorial city history consisting of 13 murals hanging
from the tall concrete flood wall along the James River.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation put up another mural of Lee, this time from a
famous portrait of the downcast general taken a few days after his
surrender at Appomattox.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 17, which Virginia celebrates as a holiday honoring
Lee, Jackson and Martin Luther King Jr., somebody set fire to the
Lee mural. Leaders of the Sons of Confederate Veterans urged police
to prosecute the yet-unsolved incident as a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, the Lee statue on Monument Avenue was
defaced by graffiti reading ``Kill the white devil,'' said Brag
Bowling, central Virginia commander for the Sons of Confederate
Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   A third Lee mural now hangs from the flood wall, and it, too,
appears to have been vandalized. What looks like a small burn
appears at the cuff of Lee's left trouser leg.
</P>
<P>
   What Bowling finds more upsetting is Lee's placement in a series
of murals also honoring Abraham Lincoln and Powhatan Beaty, a black
man who won the Medal of Honor fighting for the Union. In another
mural, the city of Richmond is in flames, with soldiers retreating
across the James River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert E. Lee had a huge role in this city,'' said Bowling,
who serves on the historical interpretation committee. Committee
member Rob Corcoran believes that the panel will spur constructive
talk about race and, in the end, bring about respect for different
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how does Richmond tell its story in such a way
that is honest and inclusive?'' said Corcoran, national director
for Hope in the Cities, a Richmond-based group aimed at racial
reconciliation. ``Everybody's reality is important and needs to be
respected.''

Today, he sits in a Bexar County jail cell, waiting for a decision
Friday as to whether a judge will reduce his five-year prison
sentence for throwing an elbow at an opponent during a basketball

the last six months in the criminal courts of New York City,
prosecutors say they are seeing a change: grand jurors in Manhattan
and Brooklyn are intensively scrutinizing the testimony of police
officers and other witnesses. And in Queens, juries are deadlocking
in an increasing number of cases, a sign, prosecutors fear, that
jurors are questioning the veracity of police testimony as police
misconduct scandals continue to dominate city headlines. A juror

is this: From there, we got here. But in his new novel, ``City of
God,'' his 10th, he has taken a reverse tack. ``In this book, it

DODGERS LACK TOP GUN

By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. - The Dodgers have the big boppers in the
middle of the lineup, but after a week of Grapefruit League games,
manager Davey Johnson is still in search of the energy he craves at
the top of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   He told Devon White and Todd Hollandsworth, competing for the
center-field spot, that the starter at that position would most
likely bat leadoff. Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who excelled
in the second spot of the lineup last season, would probably follow
in setting things up for Gary Sheffield, Shawn Green and Eric
Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a slow offensive start in spring training has Johnson
looking at what to do with the top of the lineup. And the answers
aren't exactly jumping out at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That table-setting mentality is just as important as the big
mashers,'' Johnson said. ``I'm looking at who can battle a pitcher,
work a pitcher, get on, make the pitcher work. A lot of times,
those guys are overlooked. I don't overlook them. It's just as much
an art, knowing how to get on as it is being able to hit it out and
drive them in. It's just as important.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem for the Dodgers is they don't have a leadoff
hitter. It's one of the negative byproducts of trading Eric Young
during the offseason, but something the Dodgers knew when the deal
was made.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth and White have each batted leadoff this spring,
but neither takes a lot of pitches. White admits he strikes out too
much for a leadoff guy but also points to his World Series titles
as proof he can be that important cog.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Grudzielanek, who has gap power and has become a
favorite of Johnson's, could bring the energy to the top of the
lineup. None of the three, however, possess high on-base
percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, White and Hollandsworth combined to walk 94 times
in 1,223 at-bats last season. Young walked 63 times in 456 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely make mental notes of guys who can hit one or
two,'' Johnson said. ``Who are guys that work a pitcher, who are
guys that can drop one down, who are guys that hit behind a runner,
who are guys that take some pitches in a count to get on?''
</P>
<P>
   Orel kudos to Claude: Orel Hershiser has spent the spring
tutoring the young pitchers, but he wanted to make sure someone was
coaching (begin ital)him(end ital), so he talked to pitching coach
Claude Osteen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adjusted my front (left) arm,'' Hershiser said. ``He got me
to get my front arm up a little higher, which keeps me closed
longer and makes me feel a little stronger. Instead of feeling like
I need to create some power, it feels like it's naturally there.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was three hitless innings Wednesday against Detroit,
a far cry from the battle he had in his first outing of the spring
last week against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Lefty Onan Masaoka, who sprained his left ankle
two weeks ago, is scheduled to pitch today... Though Chan Ho Park
gave up five runs on six hits in three innings, he wasn't
disappointed in his work. ``I threw a lot of changeups, and that
really worked, but I missed with a couple of fastballs,'' Park
said. ``I'm working on things, focusing on my changeup and my
mechanics.''... Dodgers managing general partner Bob Daly and Scott
Boras, agent for third baseman Adrian Beltre, played phone tag most
of the day and didn't meet about a multiyear contract....
Outfielder Kevin Gibbs, who is high on Johnson's list of young
outfielders, had another setback when he hurt his right shoulder
working out with a medicine ball. He was initially in the starting
lineup but was scratched and had an MRI performed. Results of the
test are expected today. Gibbs missed most of the last two seasons
with injuries.... The first round of cuts came and was reserved for
pitchers. Right-handers Robinson Checo, Hal Garrett and Brian
Stephenson, the godson of senior vice president Tommy Lasorda, were
sent to minor-league camp along with lefty Jeff Granger.

   Outlook: (Split squad vs. Kansas City, Atlanta) Right-hander
Kevin Brown remains at Dodgertown to face the Royals in his second
start of the spring. In his first outing, Brown allowed two hits in
three innings. Meanwhile, rookie righty Eric Gagne travels to Lake
Buena Vista, Fla., to face the Braves. Gagne, trying to win a spot
in the rotation, was erratic in his first spring appearance. He
gave up seven runs on six hits.

<P>
   Wednesday's result: Todd Hundley hit his first homer of the
spring, a two-run shot in the second, and Chad Kreuter had a
three-run double as the Dodgers (1-6) ended a six-game losing
streak with a 12-5 win over the Detroit Tigers.

   (NYT41) CHICAGO -- March 8, 2000 -- IMMIG-JOBS-2 -- A man pushes
a cart past Industrial Stength Labor, one of several temporary
employment agencies in the area. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service has made crossing the border harder than ever. But once
inside the country, illegal immigrants are now largely left alone
as the INS now concentrates on picking up aliens who have committed
crimes. The rest are, in effect, allowed entrance to help American
employers fill jobs. (Todd Buchanan/The New York Times)

   (NYT39) BETHESDA, Md. -- March 8, 2000 -- SCI-HUMAN-GENOME -- A
last minute merger negotiation between public and private
competitors in the field of human genomes has foundered in a clash
of principles and egos. Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National
Human Genome Research Institute, said that the Celera Corp., which
claimed in 1998 that it would sequence the genome from scratch,
``wanted to gain a monopoly on the human genome as a database.''

   (NYT38) NEW YORK -- March 8, 2000 -- NY-MAYOR -- Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said Wednesday that the Senate race in New York would be
decided on its own, not by presidential candidates. The mayor's
comments, about the political benefits he might reap from George W.
Bush, were in striking contrast to the view of Hillary Rodham
Clinton's advisers, who reacted with something resembling joy to
the prospect of the Texas governor at the top of the Republican
ticket in New York. (Edward Keating/The New York Times)

   (NYT37) UNDATED -- March 8, 2000 -- INSURANCE-SCAM -- The FBI
and insurance regulators are offering rewards for information
leading to the capture of Sholam Weiss, who fled in October.
Michael D. Blutrich, below left, was outside counsel for the
National Heritage Life Insurance Co., which Weiss looted,
prosecutors say. Blutrich later admitted his role in defrauding the
insurer and a variety of other crimes, and became a government

   (NYT36) WASHINGTON -- March 8, 2000 -- CENSUS -- After weeks
marked by peace and cooperation, the partisan wars over the conduct
of the 2000 Census have erupted once again. Most of the fireworks
were centered in a hearing Wednesday held by the House Subcommittee
on the Census. The panel's chairman grilled Kenneth W. Prewitt, the
director of the Census Bureau, on his agency's alleged
unresponsiveness to requests by the GAO and other bodies for
information. (Justin Lane/The New York Times)

AFGHAN-GIRLS-SCHOOL-2 -- Forbidden to learn in the first four years
of Taliban rule, 250 girls have flocked to a school that opened
three months ago in Kabul. Most of the girls are eager, as if
deprivation had left an indelible hunger for education. (Barry

   (NYT34) KABUL, Afghanistan -- March 8, 2000 --
AFGHAN-GIRLS-SCHOOL-1 -- Education for girls was forbidden in

KOSOVO-UNREST-3 -- A Belgian soldier with the NATO-led peacekeeping
operation carries shields used during riot control past a house
with Serb nationalist graffiti earlier this week. The graffiti,
written on a building in the predominantly ethnic-Albanian side of
the city, symbolizes Serbian unity. After days of unrest,
peacekeepers in this industrial town in northern Kosovo say they
see no way out of the quagmire of ethnic hatred. (Andrew Testa/The

   (NYT29) SAN ANTONIO -- March 8, 2000 -- PLAYER-SENTENCED -- Just
over a year ago, 18-year-old Tony Limon was a senior starter for
the Bobcats, the South San Antonio High School basketball team.
Today, he sits in a Bexar County jail cell, waiting for a decision
Friday as to whether a judge will reduce his five-year prison
sentence for throwing an elbow at an opponent during a basketball
game, breaking the player's nose. The severity of the sentence for
Limon - already in trouble with the law when the altercation took
place - has surprised many. (Delcia Lopez/The San Antonio

   (NYT28) NEW YORK -- March 8, 2000 -- NY-JURIES-POLICE -- Over
the last six months in the criminal courts of New York City,
prosecutors say they are seeing a change: grand jurors in Manhattan
and Brooklyn are intensively scrutinizing the testimony of police
officers and other witnesses. And in Queens, juries are deadlocking
in an increasing number of cases, a sign, prosecutors fear, that
jurors are questioning the veracity of police testimony as police
misconduct scandals continue to dominate city headlines. A juror
examined his handbook and summons card. (Ruby Washington/The New

   (NYT27) PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad -- March 8, 2000 --
TRINIDAD-ASH-WEDNESDAY -- After the half-dressed Carnival
masqueraders had turned the city into a giant boom box, Steve
Richards' worry was not over what was gone, but who had vanished.
He runs Rebirth House, a drug rehabilitation program that operates
four recovery homes. ``Today what I have to do is a damage

if anyone had forgotten the Twelve Steps of Recovery amidst the

   (NYT26) NEW YORK -- March 8, 2000 -- DOCTOROW-CITY -- If a theme
runs through all of E.L. Doctorow's work, it is the past as
progenitor of the present. The persistent suggestion of his fiction
is this: From there, we got here. But in his new novel, ``City of
God,'' his 10th, he has taken a reverse tack. ``In this book, it
seems I've finally caught up to the present,'' Doctorow said his
latest novel. ``I've been very slow about it, but I finally made
it.'' (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times) LITE

   (NYT25) NEW YORK -- March 8, 2000 -- PORGY-OPERA-REVIEW -- So
beguiling is its songfulness that ``Porgy and Bess'' can conceal
how complicated it really is. But the production which opened the
New York City Opera's spring season Tuesday has larger ambitions.
It also poses more problems for the people who put it on. Alvy

spring-starved garden lovers moved through more than 100 full-scale

Clinton moments before his address on Asian policy at Johns Hopkins

INTERNET OPENS NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN TO LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Jeanne Jackson surprised the retail community by
resigning from her high-profile post as head of the Banana Republic
division of Gap Inc. to take over the helm of Wal-Mart.com, a new
Internet store. The news was shocking because Jackson had been
rumored to be on the short list of executives who might one day
succeed the Gap's longtime chief executive, Millard Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson, 54, saw her career possibilities differently.
``Mickey is the same age I am,'' Jackson said of her former boss.
``So unless he got hit by a bus, there was no way I was going to
succeed him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet field was mainly the province of men just a few
years ago. But these days, women say they are finding opportunities
that are equal to or better than those found in more traditional
companies. Women were chief executives in about 6 percent of
Internet companies that venture capital firms financed during 1999
and, more impressively, held top management posts in 45 percent of
such start-ups, according to VentureOne, a research firm in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That is a striking change from 1998, when women accounted for
only 21 percent of senior management positions and 4 percent of
chief executive posts at Internet firms receiving venture capital
backing.
</P>
<P>
   And the numbers are even more remarkable when compared with the
Fortune 500 companies, where women continue to make only marginal
gains. Women occupied fewer than 1 percent of the chief executive
slots among these giants, according to a 1998 census conducted by
Catalyst, a New York-based women's research organization. And women
accounted for only 3.8 percent of the highest- ranking corporate
officer positions.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of the Internet companies is ``definitely causing
a leveling of the playing field,'' said Denise Brosseau, the
president of the Forum for Women Entrepreneurs in San Mateo, Calif.
Brosseau argues that women will become chief executives more
quickly at Web companies because so many are now in senior
management positions. ``It is a pipeline issue,'' she said, ``and
we are really seeing women fill'' the executive vice president and
president jobs ``in record number.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the transformation of the Internet business
from one that is dominated by men to one that is welcoming women
seems to be the unquenchable need for talent. ``Frankly, I could
get a Martian hired if I tried,'' said Nancy Albertini, chief
executive of Taylor Winfield, a talent search firm specializing in
high technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet companies are also open to a wider array of
backgrounds for top managers than old-line businesses are. ``There
is a natural kind of title progression in large corporations that
is a well-defined process,'' and that takes about 20 years, said
Jay Hoag, managing partner of Technology Crossover Ventures, a
venture capital firm. ``But the Internet has changed that. Here, it
is take the ball and go play.'' Of the 46 companies Hoag financed
this year, seven had chief executives who are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a new game, the old rules don't apply,''
agrees Gayle Crowell, president of e.piphany.net. ``It is not about
creating the best products or technology, it is more about brand
building and knowing the consumer, and women are great at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowell argues that men raised in the old system might even have
a disadvantage in the fast-moving world of e-commerce. ``The
traditional financial skills can inhibit you in the Internet,'' she
said. ``I used to have whack-you-on-the-head sessions with the
guys. I tell them: `There are new rules. We are not going to worry
about profitability. We are going to worry about building the
biggest footprint possible.'''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many women in high posts at American corporations are
defecting to the Internet. Heidi Miller shocked the financial world
when she left the vaunted post of executive vice present and chief
financial officer for the megacorporation Citigroup to become chief
financial officer of Priceline.com, the ``name your own price''
Internet venture that lost about $1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said her gender played no part in her decision to leave
but added that she suspected that her new environment would be a
better place for women to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've had a very good run, but that doesn't excuse what
I know to be real bias,'' Miller said of her experience at
Citigroup. She noted that Priceline and similar Web-related
start-up companies were smaller and under great pressure to produce
results quickly. ``When the going gets tough, everyone has to row
and everyone is treated better as a result.'' She added, ``I would
also expect that the legacy of culture that bred some of the bias
doesn't exist at new companies.''

OFFICER AND 2 FIREFIGHTERS DIE IN AMBUSH AT MEMPHIS HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Two firefighters and a sheriff's deputy were
shot to death Wednesday when they were ambushed as they arrived at
a burning house where the body of a woman, apparently the wife of
the suspected gunman, was later found inside.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, identified as Fred Williams, a city firefighter,
was in custody Wednesday night at a hospital where he was treated
for wounds he received in an exchange of gunfire with police
officers after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Fleming, deputy chief of the Fire Department, said that
Williams had returned to active duty only a few days ago, having
been on leave under an employee assistance program. Fleming
declined to say what problem had caused Williams to take leave. But
he believed that Williams knew the firefighters who were shot, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect this,'' said H.J. Pickett, the Memphis fire
chief. ``We're here to fight fires. You want to say it's part of
the job, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were unsure how the woman inside the house had
been killed. But neighbors and relatives said she was Williams'
wife, and her former husband, Herman Harrison, identified her as
Stacey Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said they received two emergency calls
from the quiet, upscale neighborhood shortly before 1 p.m. One,
apparently from the suspect, reported the fire, and the other, from
a neighbor, reported that shots had been fired. A sheriff's deputy
said that when the firefighters pulled up at the house, a man ran
out of the garage firing a shotgun and shouting: ``Get away! Get
away!''
</P>
<P>
   By the time a car from the sheriff's department pulled up a few
moments later, two firefighters had already been shot to death,
said sheriff's Deputy Don Wright. The driver of the sheriff's car,
identified as Deputy Rupert Peete, was fatally shot as he arrived
at the scene, and the car went crashing through a fence.
</P>
<P>
   The dead firefighters were identified as Lt. Javier Lerma, 41,
and Pvt. William Blakemore, both of Engine Co. 55. Williams was
assigned to a different firehouse, department officials said, but
may have worked with the victims at the scenes of previous fires.
</P>
<P>
   One other person was shot as well, a woman who happened to be
walking by the house. But her injuries were said to be not serious.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis police officers arrived shortly after the slayings, and
their gunfire wounded Williams in the lower torso. Surgeons at the
hospital treated his injuries, which were not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Crews, director of the Memphis police, said he suspected
that the fire had been deliberately set. But it was unclear whether
it was set after Mrs. Williams was killed, perhaps an effort to
cover up her death, or whether it was solely a means of luring the
firefighters to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, Mrs. Williams' former husband, said she married
Williams about three weeks ago. The relationship was not working
out, he said, and he had tried to get custody of his 8-year-old
son, who was living at the house. The boy was in school when the
shooting broke out and was later taken to stay with Harrison's
sister.

 &HT;    EDs: 1ST LEDE-WRITETHRU: Updates McCain campaign status
 &HT;    
 &HT;    McCain ponders ending campaign
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ The winner was out and about Wednesday. The
loser was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after he scored decisive victories, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas sounded the first notes in his fight for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican John McCain, who won just four of the 13 Republican
contests Tuesday, flew from Los Angeles to his cabin near Sedona
with the media in tow. McCain is weighing what to do now that the
Republican nomination all but belongs to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed news reports Wednesday night that McCain
would halt his campaign, at least temporarily. Citing unnamed
McCain advisers, CNN said the Arizona senator would announce at a
noon news conference today that he is leaving the race. But, CNN
said, another campaign aide indicated it was possible that McCain
would ``suspend'' campaign operations and not formally withdraw
until Bush has secured the 1,034 delegates needed to clinch the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said McCain has no campaign events scheduled after
Thursday's announcement, except for an off-the-record barbecue with
journalists at McCain's rustic cabin near Sedona. Reporters were
told they would be sent to Phoenix at the end of the day _ without
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries and caucuses Tuesday lived up to their billing as
the make-or-break round of voting, and Wednesday brought a clear
change in focus.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was in Austin, where he voted for himself in next week's
Texas presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting McCain's decision, Bush is expected to campaign today
in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, which hold primaries Friday. Texas,
Florida and four other states vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Having put down McCain's stubborn challenge with the help of
conservative Republicans, Bush turned his attention to the
formidable task of winning support from centrist voters who have so
far shunned him for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He praised McCain, abandoning the vitriol that has marked their
increasingly contentious race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the campaign allowed him to show Americans that he
could ``come through a tough primary intact.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men spoke Tuesday night, a conversation Bush described
as ``good,'' but that McCain political director John Weaver called
``quick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will resolve any differences we have at a later date,''
Bush said. ``I'm confident we will be able to do so. He waged a
good campaign. He's a tough competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain touched a nerve, and that is people are sick
and tired of what's going on in Washington,'' Bush said. ``I also
touched that same nerve. That's why our party is energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is now going after Vice President Al Gore, who has said
keeping a Democrat in office is the best way to keep the economy
humming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to respond by saying if people are happy with the
status quo in Washington, then vote for Al Gore,'' said Bush. ``If
people are happy with Al Gore and Bill Clinton, the tone they've
set for America, then you've got a perfect person to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Bush's running mate also intensified
Wednesday, despite the governor's protests that such talk is
premature.
</P>
<P>
   Several names made the rounds Wednesday on an informal e-mail
network of Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   Included were Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts
of Oklahoma, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, New York Gov.
George Pataki, former GOP presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole,
U.S. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Gen. Colin Powell and Sen.
Connie Mack of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he would not accept the No. 2 spot ``under any
circumstances.''

SENATE CLEARS WAY FOR VOTE ON STALLED JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (bl) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted Wednesday to end debate and move
to a final vote on two of President Clinton's nominees for federal
appeals court posts in California whose nominations have been
stalled for years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, moved aggressively to
block a rebellion in his party in order to fulfill his promise to
have a floor vote on the two nominees, Judge Richard A. Paez and
Marsha L. Berzon.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have been nominated for seats on the 9th Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which covers California and
several other Western states. The Senate is expected to narrowly
confirm both, probably on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both nominees have come to symbolize the angry and divisive
politics behind judicial nominations. Paez, of U.S. District Court
in Los Angeles, was first nominated to the appeals court seat more
than four years ago, setting a modern record for the time a nominee
has waited for a final vote. Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer, was
first nominated more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two nominees are expected to win the approval of all 45
Democrats and at least six Republicans, including Sen. Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Democrats campaigned to save the nominees, charging
that Republicans had purposely slowed the process of confirming
federal judges in the hopes of keeping as many seats vacant as
possible in the hope that a new Republican president would be able
to select the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch disputed that charge. Lott agreed to a vote on the
nominations by March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee, said he believed the Republicans had tried to
kill the nominations by preventing a floor vote because they would
be reluctant to vote against a Hispanic candidate in an election
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the race to decode the human genome nearing completion and
the stocks of genome companies soaring, a last-minute merger
negotiation between the public and private competitors has
foundered in a clash of principles and egos. In an exchange of
letters over the last week and a half, each side sought to blame
the other for the breakdown and for failing to negotiate in good
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Although a long history of disagreement between the principals
on each side probably did not help matters, a basic obstacle was an
impasse between the public consortium's desire to make the
information in the genome freely available to all researchers and
the need of the private company, Celera, for enough proprietary
safeguards to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The decoding of the human genome is expected to mark a new era
in medicine in which diseases will be analyzed and treated in terms
of the genes that cause or influence them.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying the sequence of the 3 billion chemical units of DNA
that make up the human genome has been a 10-year project of a
public consortium of university centers, financed largely by the
National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust of London.
</P>
<P>
   But in May 1998, the newly formed Celera Corp. of Rockville,
Md., leapt into the fray with the surprise announcement that it
would sequence the genome from scratch with a novel approach and
finish several years ahead of the public consortium's target date.
Both Celera and the public consortium have said they will finish
decoding the most important parts of the genome sometime this
spring, a deadline that for both seems to be slipping into summer.
</P>
<P>
   When Celera's approach seemed to be succeeding, despite
predictions from some scientists that it could never work,
observers in both camps realized that they were pursuing the same
end with complementary means. Celera had a top-down method for
sequencing the genome, the public consortium a bottom-up approach.
If the two data sets were combined, the genome might be sequenced
much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the DNA sequencing on the public consortium's side has
been carried out under Dr. John Sulston at the Sanger Center in
Britain and Dr. Robert Waterston at Washington University in St.
Louis. Both strongly support the idea of placing all human DNA
immediately in the public domain, and have reservations about
dealing with Celera.
</P>
<P>
   It was another member of the public consortium, Dr. Eric Lander
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who approached Dr. J.
Craig Venter, the president of Celera, with the idea of a
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   After preliminary talks, a meeting was held between the
principals on Dec. 29. On the public consortium's side were
Waterston, Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Human Genome
Research Institute, and Dr. Harold Varmus, then director of the
National Institutes of Health. Venter was joined by Tony White,
president of Celera's parent company, PE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But Lander and other doves were absent, resulting in a meeting
of hawks without a mediator. The meeting broke up in mutual
feelings of distrust. After two months of silence, Collins and
Varmus wrote on Feb. 28 to Celera that they would assume that the
idea of cooperation was dead unless they heard from Celera by March
6. The two officials included a proposed statement of shared
principles, including that ``the current antagonism and excessive
competition should be replaced with a more collaborative spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a day after the institutes' deadline, Venter replied
that Celera was still interested in collaboration and that the
institutes' letter had ``dramatically misstated'' the company's
position on its needs for intellectual property protection.
</P>
<P>
   The stark disagreement is in one sense surprising because the
two sides recently joined forces in successfully sequencing the
genome of the laboratory fruit fly, used by Celera as a critical
pilot project for its human genome strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But fruit fly genes are of no direct medical value, and the two
sides were able to share credit and make their data public without
acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   With the human genome data, there are much higher stakes in
terms of intellectual credit for a landmark achievement and the
prospect of a huge commercial payoff.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the Dec. 29 meeting, the institutes' side insisted that the
merged data set should be freely used by everyone, including
Celera's commercial competitors, like Incyte Pharmaceuticals. White
indicated he could not agree to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting went far astray when Waterston started defending
Incyte's right to sell the Celera data,'' Venter said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Collins, White declared that Celera ``wanted to
gain a monopoly on the human genome as a database,'' and that ``it
would be difficult for a publicly supported enterprise to become
complicit in that.'' As for Celera's wish to prevent competitors
from selling its data, ``That is taking a whack at the entire
sector that seeks to take this sequence and provide it in a usable
form,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   But in refusing to allow Celera proprietary safeguards, NIH
officials may have pushed the company too hard. ``I don't think the
director of a publicly traded company can afford to give away
everything they have,'' said Dr. Gerald Rubin, the University of
California biologist who led the public consortium's side of the
fruit fly genome project.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Celera and Venter had ``completely honored the letter
and spirit of their agreements.'' He said he was puzzled at the
pressure on Celera to release its data when it had already made
public far more than any of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the human genome is a gold mine in principle, it is
unclear exactly where the commercial payoff will come. The genome
itself is just a mystifying string of the same four chemical
letters, with no evident punctuation, annotation or chapter
headings. Interpreting and making use of it will be the work of
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norton Zinder of Rockefeller University, a member of
Celera's scientific advisory board who had favored collaboration,
attributed the breakdown in talks partly to the difficulty of
predicting the course of the genome's commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no paradigm for how you value the information in the
human genome sequence in itself,'' Zinder said. ``When you do other
things to the information, it is priceless _ but that value comes
afterward and you don't know at what stage of this later work it
will be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Venter said he still intended to make Celera's human genome
sequence available to academic researchers without restriction on
commercial uses they might develop from it.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements seem certain to continue even if the two sides go
their separate ways. In an asymmetry caused by the public
consortium's open access policy, Celera can use its rival's data,
which is made public in a computer database known as GenBank.
Venter plans to publish a human genome sequence based on both
Celera's and the public consortium's data. But the NIH officials in
their letter called this plan ``a breach of scientific ethics''
because it involved publishing other scientists' primary data.
</P>
<P>
   Venter termed the position ridiculous because the posting of
data in GenBank constituted a publication, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the differences with the public consortium began at a
May 1998 meeting when Collins of the NIH, under pressure from his
English colleagues, first decided against collaborating with
Celera.

BIDEN JOINS GOP IN CALL FOR DELAY IN MISSILE-DEFENSE PLAN 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding weight to a growing bipartisan movement, a
senior Democratic senator has warned President Clinton that he
should leave the decision on deploying a national missile-defense
system to the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., who is the ranking minority
member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told an audience
of scientists on Friday at Stanford University that he did not
believe that the North Korean missile threat was sufficient to
warrant a vastly expensive system that was not technically proven.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Biden said deploying the system could not only severely
upset relations with Russia, but also encourage China to increase
sharply its warheads, prompting an arms race in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to make a decision on a national
missile-defense system in the summer. His top arms negotiators have
been talking to the Russians over six months about deploying the
system in a way that Moscow might find acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Biden stated his opposition after Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., on the
Foreign Relations Committee, called for a delay on the decision
until a new president took office.
</P>
<P>
   Henry A. Kissinger recently wrote that an election year was not
the time to proceed on national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Biden, who amplified his comments on Monday in an interview,
also cited election year politics as a reason for postponing a
decision. Biden said that he disagreed with White House advisers
who say Vice President Al Gore and the Democrats need to proceed
with the system to inoculate themselves against Republican
criticism of being weak on national defense and that the Democrats
would be most successful by campaigning on the strength of the
economy, and not allowing the Republicans to turn the focus to
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to cost $30 billion, and there has been no
national debate,'' Biden added. ``This doesn't make sense absent
public debate.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his opposition to Clinton's making a far-reaching
foreign-policy decision under such time pressure, Biden said he was
particularly uneasy with the missile-defense system because he
thought that it would essentially mean withdrawal from the
Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   That treaty, which its advocates regard as the cornerstone of
arms control, forbids a missile-defense system that protects an
entire nation. The administration has been trying to persuade
acting President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to amend the ABM
treaty so that Clinton could decide on a system without abrogating
the pact. The Russians have shown few signs of agreeing.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Biden said he had an alternative idea to
answer the threat from North Korea's Taepo Dong missiles, which are
believed to be able to deliver strategic warheads to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Biden said an Aegis sea-based system with missiles based off the
North Korean coast would let the United States intercept the
missiles in their ascents. Such a system would not endanger the
whole fabric of arms control or threaten nonproliferation
safeguards in the way that a national missile defense would, Biden
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Biden spoke at Stanford, former Defense Secretary William
S. Perry was in the audience. Perry has also expressed reservations
about the system being the best way to counter the threat of
long-range missiles from North Korea and in Congressional testimony
favored the sea-based system off North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Biden said that he intended to discuss his arguments with
Clinton and that he would try to marshall support in the national
security community _ among high-profile former defense officials,
for example _ to focus added attention on his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed to the Stanford scientists to make their voices
heard ``in this highly charged political environment, with such a
momentous decision to be made.''

SONTAG TRAVELS FAR AND WIDE IN `AMERICA' 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KIPEN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cover photograph of Susan Sontag's new novel, ``In
America,'' gives us the nape of a woman's neck, the clasp on her
string of black pearls and a decorative comb embedded in the whorls
of her elaborately coiffed hair. Of her face, we see nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Miles Davis taking a solo with his back to the audience,
the image prefigures a novel that will flirt with, provoke and
confound its readers, staying always slightly aloof. Love me or
hate me, the coquette says. I'm not doing this for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America'' narrates the story of Maryna Zalezowska, an aging
diva of the Polish stage who grows weary of her celebrity and
strikes out for the United States in its centennial year, 1876.
Modeled on the 19th century actress Helena Modjeska, Maryna means
to found a commune _ called a ``phalanstery'' _ in accordance with
the precepts of the French socialist Fourier.
</P>
<P>
   Maryna goes to America with a considerable entourage: her
husband, an aristocrat with an eye for stable boys; one of her many
admirers, a young journalist modeled on ``Quo Vadis'' author Henryk
Sienkiewicz; her son, Piotr, who goes native in no time flat and
soon insists on being called Peter; and a few assorted and somewhat
interchangeable hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a chance meeting with Charles Nordhoff, the
pamphleteer of ``California: For Health, Pleasure, and Residence''
_ and later the co-author of ``Mutiny on the Bounty'' _ the
immigrants have decided to join the California land rush and create
their pseudo-kibbutz in rural Anaheim. It's one of the book's more
delicious ironies that Maryna's doomed experiment in utopian
socialism takes place hard by the eventual site of another, more
successful experiment in utopian capitalism, namely Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Sontag's best, most lyrical writing crops up during
Maryna's Anaheim sojourn. There's an echo of Willa Cather in the
sensuality of this passage, where the newly arrived pilgrims split
up and wander separately into the desert around their plot:
</P>
<P>
   ``No landscape, not even the swampy jungle of the Isthmus of
Panama, had struck any of them as this awesomely strange. And they
were not being borne through it, receiving it as a view, but
walking in it, on it, for it was all pale surface, the sky so lofty
and the ground so level, and they had never felt as erect, as
vertical, their skin brushed by the hot Santa Ana wind, their ears
lulled by the oddly intrusive sound of their own footfalls.''
</P>
<P>
   During its Southern California interludes, ``In America'' marks
a homecoming of sorts for Sontag. From her career as one of
America's most dynamic intellectuals, writing for august
taste-making journals such as the New York Review of Books and
Partisan Review, one might suppose her a lifelong Manhattanite _ a
foundling, maybe, discovered in swaddling clothes on the steps of
the 92nd Street Y. In truth, Sontag, 67, is the pride of North
Hollywood High, born in New York but raised in Arizona and Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sontag, Maryna doesn't stay in Southern California for
long. The communards' first solitary forays into the wilderness
prove prophetic: Soon almost everybody has splintered off in a
different direction, leaving work undone and utopia unrealized.
Maryna eventually goes back onstage, making her American debut at
the California Theater on Bush Street in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   This sets the stage for one of the wiggiest denouements in
contemporary fiction. It's a gloriously unhinged monologue by
American actor Edwin Booth (brother of the more famous John Wilkes)
in which he prepares either to ravish Maryna, kill her or merely go
over a bit of blocking with her for their touring production of
``The Merchant of Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the book's ambitious themes _ the artist's role in
society, the conflicting imperatives of love and career, the unkept
promises of American democracy _ come back for a curtain call in
this brilliantly theatrical speech, complete with stage directions.
But just how it's meant to resolve what's gone before is less a
matter for popular newspaper reviewing than for prolonged academic
exegesis, or possibly one of those reader contests that landed the
book ``Masquerade'' atop the best-seller lists a few years ago.
Explicate the ending and win $10,000!
</P>
<P>
   ``In America'' probably ought to be read twice or not at all.
There's that much there, and it's that hard to tease out. As with
the dry soil of 1870s California, tenderfeet need feel no shame for
wanting to pack it in, but a prodigious harvest awaits those
pioneers willing to invest the time.
</P>
<P>
   Students of California literature, in particular, may welcome
Sontag's scrupulous, often epigrammatic descriptions of a state now
largely unrecognizable. ``You haven't seen the real America,'' a
half-drunk Nordhoff admonishes all who will hear him in a Manhattan
tavern. ``Get out of New York. Nobody cares about anything here
except money. Go out west. Go to California. It's paradise.
Everyone wants to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Maryna's real-life inspiration, Helena Modjeska,
lends her name to a certain Modjeska Canyon near Anaheim. A cursory
search of the Internet for further information yields only this
ominous link: ``Best selection of homes! Modjeska Canyon home
loans!''
</P>
<P>
   In California _ where, in Sontag's lovely phrase, ``America has
its America, its better destination where everyone dreams of
going'' _ the land rush continues.

SCIENCE PANEL SUPPORTS GORE SATELLITE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A satellite project initially proposed by Vice
President Al Gore and opposed by congressional Republicans appears
to have scientific merit to justify it, a National Academy of
Sciences task force said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which would deploy a satellite called Triana in a
high orbit to observe the entire Earth continually, could make
contributions to Earth and solar science at a relatively reasonable
cost, said a panel of experts assembled by the academy's National
Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   In a report requested by Congress last summer, the eight-member
panel said the scientific objectives of the $70 million project
``are consonant with published science strategies and priorities
for collection of climate data sets and the need for development of
new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cover letter to the report, the panel, whose chairman was
Dr. James J. Duderstadt of the University of Michigan, said it did
not have the time and expertise to conduct a full cost-benefit
analysis of the project. However, it said: ``The task group found
that the cost of Triana is not out of line for a relatively small
mission that explores a new Earth observing perspective and
provides unique data.''
</P>
<P>
   The Triana project sprang from a 1998 idea of Gore to have NASA
fly an inexpensive spacecraft that would make continuous, live
pictures of the full, sunlit Earth from far out in space, something
that cannot currently be done. Gore said such views, constantly
made available to the world on the Internet and on television,
would encourage environmental consciousness and educational
programs.
</P>
<P>
   After initial studies that resulted in adding instruments to the
satellite and expanding its scientific mission, NASA found $30
million to start the program. But critics, including Republican
politicians and some scientists, immediately questioned the value
of the project, sometimes derisively called Gorecam or Goresat.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to continuously monitoring Earth in one view and the
amount of energy it gets from the sun and reflects into space,
Triana would also have instruments to measure ozone, cloud height
and the amounts of aerosols suspended in the air, from a vantage
point one million miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the Republican-controlled House approved a three-year
NASA financing bill that eliminated Triana financing. A
House-Senate conference committee later agreed to suspend spending
on the project and delay the satellite's planned launching to early
2001 from December while the panel from the independent science
academy studied its value.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Lane, the White House science adviser, Wednesday
praised the academy's report in a statement, saying it showed that
Triana could produce technologically sound results at a reasonable
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Triana is worthy of bipartisan congressional support and
should not be kept earthbound,'' Lane said, ``Instead, it should
fly as scheduled next year.''
</P>
<P>
   A staff member with the House Science Committee, which voted
last year along party lines not to finance the program, said
congressional opponents would have to study the new report before
commenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still questions as to whether this is the best use
of space research dollars, particularly when there are other worthy
areas of research that are not being adequately funded,'' said the
staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

VENTURE LED BY EX-MICROSOFT OFFICIALS AND OTHERS LOOKS BEYOND PC

 (Attn: Md., Wash.)  By STEVE LOHR

<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of former executives from the Microsoft Corp. are
expected to announce Thursday the creation of a holding company to
invest in and nurture start-ups focused on what has been called the
``post-PC world,'' a time when the personal computer and Microsoft
no longer dominate the technology markets.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman and chief executive of the new venture, the
Ignition Corp., is Brad Silverberg, 45, a former senior executive
at Microsoft who guided the company's catch-up strategy to embrace
the Internet. He is being joined by seven former Microsoft managers
who were part of that campaign, including Cameron Myhrvold, John
Ludwig and Jonathan Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The founding group also includes a pair of wireless executives:
Steve Hooper, former chief executive of McCaw Cellular
Communications, and Kathy Iskra, the former chief financial officer
of Nextlink Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The venture will investment mainly in companies developing
wireless Internet access, the technologies that bridge the cellular
telephone and the handheld computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the next big thing that is going to change the
world, as the PC and the Internet did, will be wireless Internet,''
Silverberg said. ``It's going to be one of those tidal waves in
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, 36, formerly headed Windows CE, Microsoft's operating
system for handheld computers. Yet today's handheld computers _ a
fast-growing market led by the popular Palm line of personal
digital assistants _ are forerunners of what Roberts predicts will
evolve into more sophisticated ``intelligent devices.'' This
emerging category, he said, will be able to wirelessly send and
receive communications ranging from e-mail and scheduling
information to alerting users to bargains at stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be lifestyle devices, and they will go well beyond
what the PC has done,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The software expertise of the former Microsoft executives should
be a crucial asset, Silverberg said. ``Software is going to play a
big role in the development of the wireless Internet, just as
software was the spark that brought the Internet to life,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ignition intends to make buy-and-hold investments. It will make
what Silverberg called ``significant but noncontrolling stakes'' in
a small group of companies. He said Ignition already was in
discussions with a handful of companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not going to follow the typical venture-capital
model of investing in companies, taking them public, flipping those
investments and starting all over,'' Silverberg said. ``We'll be in
for the long haul. We're builders, not financial engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignition, which is based in Bellevue, Wash., is beginning with
$140 million in working capital. In addition to its founders, the
company has three other investors: Qualcomm Inc., Softbank Venture
Capital and Madrona Venture Group.
</P>
<P>
   Industry consultants say that while Ignition has an impressive
team, its lack of international expertise may be a drawback.
Western Europe has been the pace setter in wireless markets today,
with 160 million cell phone users, compared with about 90 million
in the United States, according to Shosteck Associates, a
consulting firm in Wheaton, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Internet, America is the cutting edge, but in wireless
we're not,'' said Jane Zweig, executive vice president of Shosteck
Associates. ``The issue for Ignition will be whether they really
understand the wireless world.''
</P>
<P>
   The team from Microsoft is working hard at that challenge.
Rather than a passive investment, Ignition represents their
post-Microsoft careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our gig,'' Roberts said. ``We're checking the e-mail
at midnight and again at 5 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft, the term ``post-PC'' computing has been fiercely
resisted. The handheld business that Roberts once headed was
instead deemed to be part of ``PC-plus'' computing. While he may
have left, Roberts still echoes the Microsoft marketing message.
``This the next wave of computing, but each wave augments and
amplifies the previous one,'' he said.

ANALYSIS: BUSH, WEAK IN NEW YORK, MAY NOT INVEST MUCH EFFORT
THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Memo to New Yorkers: Say goodbye to George W. Bush
and Al Gore. You are probably going to see very little of them in
the state between now and Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Bush won a solid victory against John McCain in the
Republican primary in the state on Tuesday. But any chance that
Bush might bring his general election campaign into this Democratic
state this fall _ and there was a time when Bush's aides asserted
that such an unconventional strategy was under consideration _
seemed remote Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans reviewed the
decidedly limited contours of Bush's victory in New York's
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received 50.4 percent of the votes cast for his delegates,
compared with 43.8 percent for McCain, a respectable showing on the
face of it. But exit polls found that a full 38 percent of the
Arizona senator's supporters said they would vote in November for
the Democratic candidate if McCain was not the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is probably inflated by the polarization created by
the hard-hitting campaign that Bush pursued against McCain.
Nonetheless, it is a high number, and cannot be seen as good news
by Bush's supporters. By contrast, just 17 percent of supporters of
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey said they would vote for the
Republican nominee this fall if Vice President Al Gore won the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was ample evidence that Bush is a less than
compelling figure even within his own party, which is the minority
party in New York. Among Republican voters in New York City and on
Long Island, 21 percent said they would vote for Gore in November;
statewide, 22 percent of Republican women said they would vote for
Gore. By contrast, just 5 percent of Democratic women said they
would vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And only one-third of Republican respondents said that Bush says
what he truly believes, rather than what people want to hear _ a
sign that the attacks McCain made on him last week, and that Gore
has begun to pick up, had taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the problems go beyond the candidate himself: there
were strong indications in Tuesday's results that the New York
Republican Party's establishment, which supported Bush, is not what
it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's delegates (Republicans voted for individual delegates, as
opposed to the candidates themselves) lost across Nassau County,
the part of the state that once was the showplace of Republican
organization. The party is now wracked by infighting, and the
county's fiscal disorder has undercut the party's position there.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, these results suggest not a setback for Bush, but
a maintenance of the status quo, which is that New York tends to be
in the Democratic presidential column. A Republican presidential
nominee has not carried New York since Ronald Reagan in 1984
(though Bush's father lost by just 2 percentage points to Michael
Dukakis in 1988), and the Democratic Party has a 1 million vote
registration edge in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that New York seems very much on Bush's back burner is
the latest evidence of how his fortunes were turned as he struggled
to win the nomination, particularly as he campaigned among
conservative voters in South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came to New York last October, and though a large part of
that was to raise money _ that is what usually brings Republican
candidates to the state _ he traveled aggressively across New York,
visiting poor and black neighborhoods and, presenting himself as a
``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly suggested that he was the kind of Republican who
would win New York, which, given Gore's status at the time, was a
suggestion that did not seem particularly far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers in New York insisted that nothing had changed,
and that their candidate's victory in Tuesday's primary meant that
he would be back in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in a long time, New York was in play for
the primary process,'' said Zenia Mucha, political adviser to Gov.
George E. Pataki, who ran Bush's New York effort. ``I think that
will continue in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was not widely held Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be nuts to even try,'' said one of Gore's senior
advisers, who added that the vice president, accordingly, was also
not planning to spend much time in the state. ``It would be a waste
of money.''
</P>

<P>
   Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New
York University, suggested that Bush's difficulties in New York
went beyond his base of Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said independent and Democratic voters might have been
soured by the tough campaign that Bush waged against McCain; the
tactics Bush used were the subject of much coverage and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He paid a high price for winning New York,'' Moss said. ``Up
until this campaign, he'd been a `Mr. Clean' kind of candidate. I
think they have to concede New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president who
ran the elder Bush's 1988 presidential campaign in New York and who
also ran McCain's campaign in New York this past month, sighed in
discouragement when asked if he thought Bush could compete in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said he would enthusiastically support Bush if McCain
dropped out, but did not see after Tuesday's primary how Bush could
pose a real threat to Gore in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my doubts,'' Molinari said. ``Can we win it? I guess
the theoretical answer is yes. But I'm doubtful they'll target New
York.''

NBC PUTS ITS FAITH IN THE CARTOON GOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, God is Jerry Garcia. Cool.
</P>
<P>
   Half the beat-up old VW minivans in Northern California must be
rocking in Grateful appreciation to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe these people knew it all along.
</P>
<P>
   God is a Garcia look-alike in the new animated series ``God, the
Devil and Bob,'' which premieres Thursday. He's white-bearded,
unflustered and totally casual in T-shirt, sneakers and rectangular
shades.
</P>
<P>
   His voice, though, is easily recognizable as James Garner's. And
it's Garner's voice, as much as the late Garcia's visage, that
gives the show its laid-back style.
</P>
<P>
   The other voice talent is just as impressive. Broadway star Alan
Cumming is the devil. French Stewart (``3rd Rock From the Sun'') is
Bob, a Detroit autoworker who becomes a comic battleground between
good and evil. Laurie Metcalf voices Bob's wife, Donna. Their
rebellious teenage daughter, Megan, sounds like Bart Simpson
because she's Nancy Cartwright.
</P>
<P>
   If only the writing were as sharp as the casting, ``God, the
Devil and Bob'' would be an answered prayer.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that God is losing his enthusiasm for humankind _ God
must have a TV set _ and accepts a sporting bet with Lucifer.
Humanity can save itself if it proves that it deserves another
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The devil gets to choose the person who will bear the burden of
proof, and the devil spots Bob guzzling beer on a barstool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Alman?'' sighs the Almighty. ``Not my best work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob takes some convincing, and even then hasn't a clue how to
save the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drink,'' Bob tells God in a moment of Job-like despair. ``I
swear. I download porn off the Internet _ I mean, a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   He heads home and announces, ``You'll never guess who I ran into
today.'' But his wife and daughter are quarreling and don't hear.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bob's contention that he's ``a messenger from God''
isn't readily embraced by anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In the show's third installment, it lands him briefly in the
Grassy Knoll Asylum, while Satan cheerfully assumes Bob's identity
and tries, without success, to seduce Donna.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Simpsons'' represents the manically funny end of the TV
animation spectrum and ``King of the Hill'' occupies the droll end,
then ``God, the Devil and Bob'' lies in ``Hill'' country.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, it's more humorous than broadly comic. There
are bits of broadax material _ in hell, Guy Lombardo's orchestra
plays ``Auld Lang Syne'' over and over. But the show scores better
with gentler japes. Here's God on teenagers: ``I get them till
they're 12; he (Lucifer) gets them till they're 20.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's not a howler. No one will choke on his Cheetos watching
this amiably amusing show, but give it credit for one thing.
Thursday, at least, it supplants ``Jesse'' on the NBC schedule, and
that weighs in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, ``God, the Devil and Bob'' moves to 8:30 p.m.
Tuesday, opposite the ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' juggernaut.
At NBC, the time slot is also known as the Valley of the Shadow of
Death.

</P>
<P>
   After 17 years in Congress representing eastern Los Angeles
suburbs, Rep. Matthew G. Martinez was soundly defeated Tuesday in a
primary challenge from a fellow Democrat, state Sen. Hilda L.
Solis. In unofficial returns, Solis had 63 percent of the vote, to
28 percent for Martinez, a result whose lopsided nature surprised
even supporters of the 42-year-old challenger and reflected the
continuing emergence of a new generation of Hispanic politicians in
California. Martinez, 71, known as Marty, was the only member of
Congress who lost in Tuesday's primaries around the country. He had
faced primary challenges in the past in a district that includes
towns like El Monte, Baldwin Park and Alhambra and remains safely
Democratic in November, but this contest was especially bitter,
dividing the local Hispanic elected establishment. Solis, with
backing of local unions, maintained that Martinez had grown out of
touch, and just hours before conceding, he called her obnoxious. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES D.A. STUMBLES

<P>
   Not only did Gil Garcetti, as district attorney of Los Angeles
County the head of the largest local prosecutor's office in the
nation, fall short of a majority in his re-election effort, he came
in second. Garcetti got a little more than 37 percent, to 38
percent for Steve Cooley, one of his deputies. That means they will
face off in November, with Garcetti struggling because of criticism
that he has been slow in handling a police corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   THIS BIRD WON'T FLY
</P>
<P>
   The people of Orange County, just south of Los Angeles, voted in
surprisingly strong numbers for a ballot measure that appears
likely to kill the prospect of building what would have been one of
the largest airports in the region. By 67 percent to 33 percent,
they backed Measure F, which requires that the county government
obtain two-thirds voter approval for a plan to transform the El
Toro military base into the huge airport. Few expect that the
county can muster such a majority for the project, strongly opposed
by residents in the vicinity.

   THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE AND ON TRACK
</P>
<P>
   More than 17,000 Democrats in Arizona cast ballots through the
Internet in the first two days of a primary billed as the first
binding online election. An hourlong failure caused by online
traffic congestion prevented voters from casting ballots early
Tuesday afternoon, and at least 100 voters required technical
assistance because outdated Web browsing software would not allow
them to vote. But by the end of Tuesday, more than 13,000 Democrats
had voted online, officials said. The rate fell Wednesday, after
news that Bill Bradley would drop out of the race. Arizona
Democrats with Internet access can cast ballots through Friday, at
any time of day, and those without access can vote at polling
places Saturday.

   Back from political oblivion, Mary Rose Oakar, an Ohio Democrat
who in the 1992 elections lost her seat in the U.S. House after
eight terms and later pleaded guilty to election law abuses, was
effectively elected by Democrats to a seat in the Ohio House on
Super Tuesday. Oakar defeated three primary rivals for the
nomination in a legislative district that includes part of her old
working-class congressional district. Oakar, who will be unopposed
by Republicans in November, lost her congressional seat after the
House banking and post office scandals broke in 1992. She wrote
more than 200 House bank overdrafts and circumvented election law
by funneling contributions through the House post office.

 &HT;    McCain ponders ending campaign
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ The winner was out and about Wednesday. The
loser was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after he scored decisive victories, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas sounded the first notes in his fight for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican John McCain, who won just four of the 13 Republican
contests Tuesday, flew from Los Angeles to his cabin near Sedona
with the media in tow. McCain is weighing what to do now that the
Republican nomination all but belongs to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has scheduled a news conference for noon eastern time
today at which he is exected to temporarily suspend his campaign or
leave the race altogether.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has no campaign events scheduled after today, except for
an off-the-record barbecue with journalists at his rustic cabin
near Sedona. The primaries and caucuses Tuesday lived up to their
billing as the make-or-break round of voting, and Wednesday brought
a clear change in focus.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was in Austin, where he voted for himself in next week's
Texas presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting McCain's decision, Bush is expected to campaign today
in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, which hold primaries Friday. Texas,
Florida and four other states vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Having put down McCain's stubborn challenge with the help of
conservative Republicans, Bush turned his attention to the
formidable task of winning support from centrist voters who have so
far shunned him for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He praised McCain, abandoning the vitriol that has marked their
increasingly contentious race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the campaign allowed him to show Americans that he
could ``come through a tough primary intact.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men spoke Tuesday night, a conversation Bush described
as ``good,'' but that McCain political director John Weaver called
``quick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will resolve any differences we have at a later date,''
Bush said. ``I'm confident we will be able to do so. He waged a
good campaign. He's a tough competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain touched a nerve, and that is people are sick
and tired of what's going on in Washington,'' Bush said. ``I also
touched that same nerve. That's why our party is energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is now going after Vice President Al Gore, who has said
keeping a Democrat in office is the best way to keep the economy
humming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to respond by saying if people are happy with the
status quo in Washington, then vote for Al Gore,'' said Bush. ``If
people are happy with Al Gore and Bill Clinton, the tone they've
set for America, then you've got a perfect person to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Bush's running mate also intensified
Wednesday, despite the governor's protestations that such talk is
premature.
</P>
<P>
   Several names made the rounds Wednesday on an informal e-mail
network of Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   Included were Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts
of Oklahoma, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, New York Gov.
George Pataki, former GOP presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole,
U.S. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Gen. Colin Powell and Sen.
Connie Mack of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he would not accept the No. 2 spot ``under any
circumstances.''

JETS SAID TO OFFER JOHNSON TO 6 TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Jets, apparently trying to avoid a divisive holdout by its
star player, have shopped Keyshawn Johnson to at least six teams,
including every team with a top 5 pick in April's college draft,
according to one National Football League executive.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, the Jets' director of football operations, called
the Washington Redskins earlier this week to offer Johnson straight
up for the No. 2 pick in the draft. The Redskins declined. Parcells
then offered Johnson for the Redskins' No. 3 overall pick. Again,
the Redskins rebuffed Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who has continued, through a spokesman, not to comment
on trade rumors, told one NFL executive that the reason he was
interested in moving Johnson was because he was upset that Johnson
was not the kind of team player he thought he was.
</P>
<P>
   That, presumably, is because of Johnson's desire to have his
contract renegotiated, even though there are two years left on his
original six-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is underpaid by current market standards and his agent,
Jerome Stanley, has dropped hints since the free-agent signing
period began last month that Johnson closely watched the lucrative
deal that receiver Joey Galloway signed with Dallas ($42 million
for seven years). But the Jets are in a bind, only $1 million under
the $62.172 million salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they abandoned their longstanding policy of not
renegotiating deals that have more than one year left and were
inclined to accommodate Johnson, they would have to make
significant changes to the rest of the roster to fit Johnson's
salary under the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has told one teammate that he plans to sit out the
off-season workout program, which begins in less than two weeks.
And Stanley has privately hinted to the Jets that Johnson might
hold out when camp begins in July if his contract was not reworked.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley would not comment Wednesday on the trade rumors. Johnson
has not been available for comment since the trade talk began
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jets could still decide to keep Johnson, Parcells
seems to want to stockpile picks in an attempt to move up in the
draft. The Jets have the 16th and 18th picks in the first round,
but Parcells' moves indicate the Jets want to move into position to
select one of the top players in the draft: perhaps one of Penn
State's superb defenders, the pass rusher Courtney Brown or
linebacker LaVar Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets were to acquire more picks, they may try to package
them to try to acquire the No. 1 pick, owned by the Cleveland
Browns. Dwight Clark, the Browns' director of football operations,
has said it would take a huge deal to get their pick, but he told
The Baltimore Sun that three first-rounders would be a good start.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Coach Brian Billick said the Ravens did not speak with
the Jets Wednesday. He said it was still up to the Jets to decide
how serious they were about trading Johnson for the Ravens' pick,
No. 5 over all. Billick said that discussions with the Jets are no
further along than the talks the team has had with at least 10
teams about their pick, although he maintained that he was
optimistic about a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten far enough that we laid out the parameters that
if they do decide they want to crank it up, we could move fairly
quickly,'' Billick said. ``Certainly we're interested. How serious
they are, they have to let us know. We can only linger with this so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will come a point where we will either move on or the
Jets will have to increase their interest. This needs to go to the
next level within the next day or two or we need to move on. We're
not going to be sitting here and be paralyzed by it. We have other
things to attend to. If this is going to happen, New York needs to
make overtures in the next 24 hours. We're not going to wait until
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick said the Ravens would want to meet with Johnson and
Stanley before any deal was made. They had not received permission
from the Jets to do that Wednesday. At least with the Ravens,
Billick seemed to say, everyone needs to take a deep breath and
calm down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Keyshawn watch,'' Billick said. ``I was at a
function and everyone was waiting for my cell phone to ring. All of
a sudden I'm supposed to be in L.A. to talk to Keyshawn and I'm
not. I'm sitting right here. We're nowhere near there. I'm going to
have dinner with my wife, and I don't expect to be interrupted.''

SENATE INQUIRY SUGGESTS NFL DRUG POLICY FAVORED STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An investigation into the National Football League's drug policy
by a Senate caucus on drug control found indications that the
league at one time practiced a policy of allowing star players to
escape punishment from failed drug tests while lower-tier players
did not.
</P>
<P>
   But it also determined that such a double standard likely no
longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, according to people familiar with it,
concluded that such a double standard may have been applied in at
least several instances, some within the past four or five years;
evidence strongly indicated that some of the league's best players
failed drug tests, but were not punished, because of their high
profile status. Meanwhile, lower-level players were readily
punished.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no conclusive evidence such practices now
exist, those people said.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry, conducted by Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, and
chairman of the Senate's Caucus on International Narcotics Control,
was begun after an article in The New York Times last September
reported on the double standard.
</P>
<P>
   The article said that videotapes of a 1995 National Football
League Players Association meeting showed a high-ranking union
leader saying a number of players were not punished for violating
the league's substance abuse policy. The NFL later confirmed that
16 players fell into that category.
</P>
<P>
   The league said the players were not suspended as a concession
to the union during negotiations for a stronger drug-testing
policy, which was enacted several years later.
</P>
<P>
   A league official said that while the players ``got a break,''
they were still monitored and tested under the new, more
comprehensive agreement. The NFL's current policy is believed to be
the toughest in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the impression was that the league was compromising its
standards on drug use in order to secure a new collective
bargaining agreement with the union.
</P>
<P>
   There were other questions: Who were the players that failed the
test? Did the league look the other way because some of the players
who failed the tests were high profile ones?
</P>
<P>
   Those were some of the questions the inquiry looked into, using
three Senate investigators, who first viewed the tapes in their
entirety, and then interviewed dozens of people, including NFL
officials, current and former players, and others.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation took more than six months, mainly because
there were some current NFL players and officials who wanted to
wait until the end of the regular season before being interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate caucus has completed its look into whether or not
there is an informal practice that excuses some NFL players from
the league's anti-drug policy,'' Grassley said in a statement. ``I
wanted to make sure that we didn't ignore issues raised about
double standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are indications that a double standard may have
existed in the past,'' the statement continued, ``allegations that
the drug testing policy today is biased have not been
substantiated.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement concluded: ``The league, the players, and the
players union all recognize the value of a drug-free workplace. The
drug testing policy that the NFL has in place today promotes and
enforces this standard. It's a good faith effort to have a standard
that is tough and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley's examination should bring to an end what was an
awkward period for the NFL and the union, in which accusations of a
biased and flawed drug testing program angered football officials.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to suspend the 16 players was a controversial
one even within professional football's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Several owners said they voiced strong disapproval of any deal
that would have allowed players to go unpunished and recently
reiterated those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   One owner maintained that part of the reason the league allowed
such a deal to happen was because at least one of the players had a
high profile. The owner refused to name the player. &QL;

INJURY WAVE HITS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The Angels went about halfway into camp without
any serious health issues, but Wednesday things changed. Mo Vaughn,
Jarrod Washburn and Jeff DaVanon all had health problems Wednesday
of varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was scratched from Wednesday's game against the Rockies
because of a corneal abrasion to his left eye. He rubbed his eye
Tuesday night after pieces of drywall fell from the ceiling into
his eye. It happened at Vaughn's aunt's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he should buy his aunt a new house,'' manager Mike
Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was given medication for the eye and is expected to be
back in the lineup today.
</P>
<P>
   DaVanon was examined by team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum in Los
Angeles Wednesday and was found to have a torn labrum in his left
shoulder. He sustained the injury last Friday diving for a ball in
a game against the Mariners. He is out indefinitely and the course
of treatment has not been decided.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn has a strained left external oblique muscle, just below
the rib cage. Washburn, who is competing for a spot in the starting
rotation, also will be out indefinitely. He has struggled in his
two starts, particularly his last start on Tuesday when he gave up
three runs and five hits in 2 2/3 innings. He also walked four.
</P>
<P>
   ``His command was affected by how he was feeling,'' Scioscia
said. ``It's important for him now to take a step back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a blow to Washburn's chances of making the starting
rotation, particularly because he was hampered by a similar injury
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, it's tough for him,'' Scioscia said. ``He had the
same thing last year. We had a talk with him and said let's take it
one step at a time. Obviously he won't get his next start. But as
of right now, Wash is still in the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill threw three perfect innings in the Angels' 6-3 victory
over the Rockies Wednesday afternoon at Tempe Diablo Stadium. After
the game, Scioscia said Hill would be his opening day starter
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In the victory, Jim Edmonds and Garret Anderson homered.
</P>
<P>
   In a split-squad game at Phoenix, the A's beat the Angels, 7-2.
Ramon Ortiz started and gave up one run and two hits in three
innings, the only run coming on a home run by John Jaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``My location is very good right now,'' Ortiz said. ``Inside,
outside, my fastball, slider, changeup ... everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Dickson followed Ortiz and didn't fare so well, allowing
three runs and six hits in three innings. Dickson, who is coming
off shoulder surgery, has regained his velocity but not his
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much time he needs (to regain his command), you never
know,'' Scioscia said. ``Some guys coming off injuries never regain
co don't think that's going to be the case with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Angels manager-pitching coach Marcel Lachemann
reacquianted himself with some old friends Wednesday at Angels camp
before going to work in his new position, as the Colorado Rockies'
pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Being the pitching coach for a team that plays at
hitter-friendly Coors Field is not the easiest job in the world,
but Lachemann said the decision to take the job was easy because of
his relationship with new Rockies manager Buddy Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is Buddy being the manager,'' Lachemann said.
``We had a chance to work together at the Pan Am Games and it was a
great situation. We worked together well and accomplished a
difficult task. A chance to go where he was managing was an easy
choice, it wasn't a question of where.''
</P>
<P>
   Lachemann said he won't approach coaching the pitchers in Coors
Field any different than any other ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about pitching there is you still have to do the
same things as anywhere else,'' he said. ``Sometimes you get caught
up in where you're pitching and don't do the basic things, like
throwing strikes and getting ahead of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lachemann said he still keeps a close eye on the Angels, despite
the sweeping changes to the scouting department and coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I agree with that part of it, but it's still a
good club, they have an outstanding lineup,'' he said. ``And they
have some fine arms. They'll surprise some people. I'm hearing
everybody is pleased with Mike (Scioscia). It's a question of guys
staying healthy. They've got a great lineup offensively and
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Lachemann, who was the organization's roving pitching instructor
last season, has a keen interest in the young pitchers battling for
starting spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be less than honest with you if I said I wasn't,'' he
said. ``I have a lot of time invested in those guys, so it's
natural to watch them and wish them well.''
</P>

THE BAD NEW BRAVES: SMOLTZ OUT FOR THE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Only the season will determine which part of the
anatomy will have a greater effect on the Atlanta Braves' attempt
to win their ninth consecutive division championship _ John
Rocker's mouth or John Smoltz's right elbow. The Braves could have
done without both.
</P>
<P>
   Already in a quandary over Rocker and his offensive remarks, the
Braves disclosed Wednesday that a large hole has developed in their
vaunted starting pitching rotation. Smoltz has a torn ligament in
his pitching elbow and will miss the entire season after having
surgery March 23. The Mets, the most serious threat to the Braves'
stranglehold on first place, immediately became the primary
beneficiary of Smoltz's injury.
</P>
<P>
   Although the elbow has caused Smoltz problems previously,
prompting several stays on the disabled list, the right-hander has
managed to pitch most of each season.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood, a 25-year-old right-hander who was the team's
most consistent starter last season, will replace Smoltz in the big
three, and the Braves plan to fill in behind him from pitchers on
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to stay inside the organization; that's our
primary focus at the moment,'' General Manager John Schuerholz said
by telephone from the Braves' camp in Kissimmee, Fla. ``We don't
have plans to look elsewhere right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz mentioned Terry Mulholland, a journeyman left-hander,
as the most likely candidate to be the fourth starter. Mulholland
and Bruce Chen began camp competing for the No. 5 spot.
</P>
<P>
   Although the loss of Smoltz would seem to be a blow to their
status as the top team in the National League East, the Braves, no
stranger to it, have become adept at overcoming adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Mark Wohlers lost the strike zone, the
Braves found a successful closer in Kerry Ligtenberg. When
Ligtenberg went down for the season with an elbow injury a year
ago, the Braves put Rocker in his spot and enjoyed equal success.
Last year, they learned just before spring training that Andres
Galarraga, their power-hitting first baseman, had cancer and would
miss the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' Schuerholz said, ``we're getting practice at
this _ devastating injury news in spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves determine that Mulholland and Chen are not the
answer and decide to look elsewhere for a starting pitcher, they
would join nearly every other major league team. Schuerholz did not
preclude that possibility at some point, and said if a front-line
pitcher were available, he would talk to the team that was offering
him ``if they're not asking too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who is two months from his 33rd birthday, was on the
disabled list twice in each of the last two seasons with an ailing
elbow. He twice had arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips from
the elbow, before the 1998 season and in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who pitches as long as he has and as many innings as
he has and puts that much strain on his elbow,'' Schuerholz said,
``there is the likelihood that the elbow or shoulder will give out.
He's a 200-plus-innings-a-year guy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smoltz pitched last Sunday against Tampa Bay, allowing
three runs and five hits in one and two-thirds innings, he had pain
in the elbow. He had a magnetic resonance imaging test, which
showed a torn medial collateral ligament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few days have been the worst for me,'' Smoltz said in
Kissimmee. ``Just not knowing, trying a lot of things, trying to
get ready for the season, and then after that game, for about a
five-hour period, I felt pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   When he had elbow trouble last year, Smoltz tried to alleviate
it by throwing with a three-quarters pitching motion. He also began
using a knuckleball.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who has a 157-113 career record, won the National League
Cy Young award in 1996 and has the best postseason record, 12-4,
among Atlanta pitchers.

GORE AND BUSH SET FOR FIERY RACE, STARTING AT ONCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs to insert new 6th and 7th graf to include campaign events on
Wednesday and Thursday and new 15th graf to add some doubt on
whether candidates could really campaign every day.)  (DW) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strategists for Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
said Wednesday that there would be no let up from the primary
season as they move quickly to define each other on the stump and
on the air in an unusually frenetic five-month run up to their
parties' nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns recalled how Bob Dole in 1996 and Michael Dukakis
in 1988 lay dormant in the summer before the general election,
allowing their rivals to gain the upper hand through television or
oratorical barrages. This time, officials on both sides said, that
will not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer competitiveness of the race _ early polls show Gore
and Bush running neck and neck _ also seems to be driving each
candidate to be engaged earlier and more forcefully than past
campaigns. Even if the candidates wanted to lay low, strategists on
both sides said, they could not because of the proliferation of
coverage on the Internet and on new cable television outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a continued focus on message each and every
day,'' said Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist. ``Virtually every
day, Bush will be somewhere in a position to comment on something
of significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, put it this way:
``Strap on your seat belt. The roller coaster ride has just begun.
If people think the pace has been intense up to this point, they
haven't seen anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore strategists said they could enjoy the luxury
of looking ahead because of their candidates' coast-to-coast
triumphs in a string of contests on Tuesday, the biggest primary
day of the year. Bill Bradley, after failing to win a single
contest, plans to quit the Democratic race Thursday while Sen. John
McCain, trailing badly in the Republican contest, may follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore showed no sign of slowing down Wednesday as he traveled
to Michigan and Minnesota, where Democratic delegates are being
selected in coming days. Bush basked in his victory by staying home
in Austin, Tex., as he prepared for stops Thursday in Colorado,
Utah and Wyoming, where there will be contests on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Each side is aggressively seeking the loyalties of the
independents and Democrats who flocked to Sen. John McCain, and
they are also battling over a small group of swing voters, mostly
in the Midwest, who are usually pivotal to the outcome. Strategists
in both camps said they were scheduling trips to the battleground
states of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are also taking special steps to address their
own vulnerabilities. Bush, for example, is planning international
trips _ one possibility is trips to European capitals _ to
demonstrate his grasp of international affairs and military
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to win over McCain's supporters with an extensive
series of town meetings with independent and undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a year when not advertising but contact with the
people has actually matters a lot,'' said Robert Shrum, one of
Gore's chief strategists. ``You will see Al Gore doing a lot of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, advertising is at the heart of both campaign's
blueprints in the coming months. Bush is counting on a financial
advantage because he did not accept federal subsidies in the
primaries and therefore, unlike Gore, is not subject to spending
caps. But both the Republican and Democratic Parties are collecting
so-called unregulated soft money which officials in the two
campaigns said the parties would channel into issue advertising
intended to help or hurt Bush or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials do not like talking publicly about the plans
for television blitzes. Asked what his campaign had in store, Rove
said: ``We have flexibility. We have footage collected. And we have
thoughts developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrum, even less direct, said, ``I don't want to talk about
that.'' Pressed further, he added, ``The Gore campaign will be
ready to do what it has to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be, of course, some bluffing in the Bush and Gore
organizations. It is hard to picture the candidates maintaining
nonstop schedules until the conventions in late summer. Even so,
the candidates are clearly determined not to repeat the mistakes of
losers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   A telling sign of how quickly the campaigns have shifted to
general election strategies _ even before either candidate has
officially accumulated enough delegates to win the nomination _ was
in the victory speeches by Bush and Gore on Tuesday night. It is
customary in such addresses for candidates to refer only briefly to
the race ahead. But Bush and Gore spelled out what their advisers
said Wednesday would be basic themes for the general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are racing to the center by highlighting their
more moderate stands. Bush is seeking to paint Gore as a creature
of Washington who, despite his deep involvement as vice president,
could not make sufficient progress on issues ranging from education
to health case. They will also remind voters of his ties to
President Clinton _ and of his own role in the 1996 campaign
finance debacle.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a theme that Bush officials said they hope will reverberate
month after month, Bush declared on Tuesday: ``America must not
give Clinton-Gore four more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond attacking Gore, the Bush campaign is seeking to generate
appeal, especially among women, by stressing the ``compassionate
conservative'' message upon which he based the early days of his
candidacy. In particular, Bush's aides said they expect him to
speak frequently about education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, will emphasize his own credentials on the
education issue and seek credit for his role in presiding over the
hardiest economy in decades. On a host of issues, Gore will portray
Bush as intolerant and as a vessel for the religious right and
extremists. His aides said he will accuse Bush of being against gun
control, a woman's right to have an abortion, a patient's bill of
rights and against environment regulations. As Gore asserted on
Tuesday, he will ridicule the governor's economic proposals as part
of a ``risky tax scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Several strategists in both parties said the candidates acted so
aggressively to put forth their themes because their greatest fear
is that they will be defined by their opponents _ and forfeit the
opportunity to alter their images.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first guy to let down his guard loses in these races,''
said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant. ``So I don't
see any fallow period any more in elections. The lesson Bill
Clinton taught everyone is you don't lay low. And Republicans have
learned that too.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their planned hectic campaign schedules, aides to Bush
and Gore offered some caveats. Their candidates, they said, could
conceivably take some time off. But they were careful to avoid the
word ``vacation,'' and to note that any respite would be only
brief.
</P>
<P>
   More than one aide recalled how after Dukakis captured the
Democratic nomination, he returned to his home state of
Massachusetts _ where he was governor _ and virtually vanished from
the national scene. For weeks, he tended mostly to state business
and rarely ventured beyond the western border of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists said they are not eager for the intense period
of stumping, but see no other option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the voters want to be inundated with political
campaigning every day for the next 35 weeks,'' said Haley Barbour,
an adviser to Bush and former chairman of the Republican Party.
``However, with 24-hour news television and the internet and the
vastly increased news outlets, I feel the press won't let it rest.
Every news organization is going to demand a Bush story and a Gore
story every day.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic Party,
seemed eager for the action. Already, he said, the party has begun
making decisions on advertising ``based literally on hourly reads
on where the candidates are and where they're going _ we're looking
forward to continual engagement. It will be fluid and dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, is the voters will tire of the
candidates. But that does not seem to weigh heavily in the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is, if you're not keeping your periscope up that you
might be forgotten,'' said Ronald Kaufman, a Republican national
committeeman from Massachusetts. ``Overexposure is the last thing
to worry about. Not the first.''

`MONDAY NIGHT' SHIFT ENDS ESIASON'S JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeling a need to reinvigorate ``Monday Night Football,'' ABC
Sports Wednesday purged the series of Boomer Esiason, the analyst
since 1998, as well as the longtime producer and director.
</P>
<P>
   ABC brought back Don Ohlmeyer, the producer of the show from
1971 to 1977, to light a spark under the 30-year-old show, which is
ABC's second-highest prime-time program and the highest-rated
football programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 11 months here, I've concluded it could be better,''
said Howard Katz, the president of ABC Sports, whose career started
as an assistant on the show in 1971. ``We're going to take it in a
different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz praised Ken Wolfe, the producer, and Craig Janoff, the
director, but said the production had begun to show a ``sameness.''
He added: ``I feel we have to make it special again. It has to be a
big event again. ''
</P>
<P>
   Katz and Ohlmeyer recognize the impossibility of recreating the
newness and singularity of ``Monday Night Football'' during the
1970's, when Howard Cosell and Don Meredith created a tense,
humorous and bizarre chemistry and Frank Gifford played a
combination straight man and human wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd caution anyone to believe that the goal here is to try to
redo what was done in 1973 and 1974,'' Ohlmeyer said. ``I think
there's a modern-day version of the day when `Monday Night
Football' was the epitome of sports television production in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prestige in bringing back Ohlmeyer, a legendary
producer-director who last year retired after a successful run as
the president of NBC's West Coast entertainment operations,
Wednesday's changes were stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way life goes,'' Esiason said, during a telephone
interview Wednesday. ``It's like being cut by a team. It happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, who produced ``Monday Night'' for 14 years and won 6 Emmy
Awards, said: ``We know we had a great run and a great Super Bowl
in January. It's a big surprise. But it's their prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe and Janoff, who worked together on ``Monday Night
Football'' for 12 years, were dismissed by Katz by telephone
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Al Michaels, the play-by-play announcer for ``Monday Night
Football,'' said he understood Katz's rationale for hiring
Ohlmeyer. But he said: ``I've never worked with a better producer
than Kenny or a better director than Craig. This is very
emotionally difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz informed Esiason through his agent, Steve Rosner.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Monday Night Football'' overhaul comes at a time when the
season's Nielsen rating, a 13.7, was the series' historical low.
Yet by the end of its 17-game run, it was ABC's highest-rated
series and the third-ranked in prime time. But ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' has pushed ``Monday Night Football'' aside as ABC's
top program.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Monday Night Football's'' rating has fallen, its prime-time
ranking has increased, owing to the encroachment of cable, videos
and the Internet on the broadcast networks' share of the viewing
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the changes will increase the rating is unknown. But
Katz wanted to make an imprint on the program. He started his
career at ABC Sports as a production assistant on ``Monday Night
Football'' in 1971, working under Ohlmeyer. From 1983 to 1993 he
was president of Ohlmeyer's independent production company. When
Katz decided he wanted to change ``Monday Night Football'' last
December, he turned to Ohlmeyer. ``Are you out of your mind?''
Ohlmeyer asked. He was happily retired, honing his golf game. On
Sunday, he agreed to return.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said he was flabbergasted when Ohlmeyer suggested to
him 10 days ago that he was considering a ``Monday Night Football''
redux. ``I said something like, `Are you daft?''' Michaels said.
``I lent no seriousness to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ohlmeyer must decide how to change the production of
``Monday Night Football.'' He wants to resuscitate the
unpredictability and danger that characterized the
Cosell-Meredith-Gifford years. ``There's a fertile field to plow
and to do it in an interesting, innovative way that will keep
people tuned in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will also have to determine whether to hire one or two
analysts. Michaels is not a big fan of a three-man set-up because
of the promotional announcements and other obligations that clutter
a broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has to be the right three,'' Michaels said. ``A
good two is better than a mediocre three. A great three is better
than a great two.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for Michaels' new partner(s) starts with Jimmy
Johnson, the former Dallas and Miami coach, who was a sparkplug on
Fox's pre-game studio show for three seasons. Bill Parcells, the
former Jet coach who is the team's director of football operations,
is also a candidate, but his stint with NBC as a studio analyst,
then a game announcer, was not a glowing success.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ohlmeyer adds a third announcer depends upon whether he
finds someone with the kind of personality who can generate
controversy and verbal fireworks. But he will not choose one from
outside the sports realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to see Arnold Schwarzenegger do color,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason's two-year stint was rocky. He was hired in 1998 when
ABC couldn't lure John Madden from Fox and was teamed with Dan
Dierdorf. In his first season, Esiason fended off criticism that he
did not get along with Dierdorf.
</P>
<P>
   He became the sole analyst in 1999 when ABC did not renew
Dierdorf's contract, and was criticized for not being a superstar
broadcaster. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee and the candidate he
endorsed, George W. Bush, would make little difference in the
outcome of his United States Senate race, but he added that if the
election were held today, ``I'd think he'd be a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's comments, however measured, about the political
benefits he might reap from Bush, were in striking contrast to the
view of Hillary Rodham Clinton's advisers, who reacted with
something resembling joy to the prospect of the Texas governor at
the top of the Republican ticket in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush was Rudy Giuliani's pick, and now they're joined
at the hip,'' said Howard Wolfson, Clinton's press secretary, in
what is certain to become a familiar theme. ``The mayor will have
to explain to New Yorkers why his candidate is anti-choice and
pro-gun.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days before Tuesday's presidential primaries, many New
York Republican officials said the mayor would be in a stronger
position in his Senate race if he had Sen. John McCain of Arizona
at his side in the fall, when Giuliani will need Democratic and
independent votes to beat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Giuliani seemed to endorse that view by repeatedly
praising McCain and then spending only two hours in the same room
with Bush, who was in the state campaigning for a day and a half.
Giuliani's advisers admitted they had grown nervous that Bush's
embrace of religious conservatives would alienate moderate
Republicans in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday both Democratic and Republican strategists predicted
that Giuliani would campaign to the political center and rarely
appear with Bush, who in any case is expected to spend little time
in a Democratic state like New York that he is unlikely to carry in
November. Nelson Warfield, a Republican political consultant, said
that such a scenario would suit Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'll be happy to have him change planes at Kennedy
Airport if he's flying somewhere overseas,'' Warfield said, ``but
don't expect him to stand on the runway.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Adler, a Democratic political consultant, added that
``the nature of Giuliani's problem is that instead of the
presidential candidate carrying him, the presidential candidate
will be a monkey on his back.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani strongly rejected that view, saying that New Yorkers
are often ticket-splitters, as they were in a 1992 race that
elected Alfonse M. D'Amato to the Senate, and that his race against
Clinton will have a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate election is going to get decided as a Senate
election,'' the mayor said at a news briefing at city hall. ``Just
the way it did in 1992, when Bill Clinton won the state by a
million votes and Al D'Amato won the state narrowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani added: ``There are even theories that go around that
New Yorkers will vote for one party for the president and the other
for the Senate in order to balance things. That's as interesting a
theory as anything else. So I would not be overwhelmed by the
thought of who would be better for me, or who would be better for
Clinton on the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   In the briefing, Giuliani also made a point of praising Gov.
George Pataki, the man he needs to help him defeat Clinton. The
governor and the mayor have been feuding for weeks over Giuliani's
refusal to attack McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor and I have a very, very good relationship,''
Giuliani said. ``There are times in which our staffs have little
disputes with each other.''

SENATE VOTE WOULD ALTER AIRLINE SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted 82-17 Wednesday evening to
modernize an 80-year-old law that airlines have used in the last
few years to limit payments to families of passengers killed in
crashes at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was tailored to help families of people who died
on Trans World Airlines Flight 800, with the law retroactive to
July 16, 1996, the day before that 747 exploded off the coast of
Long Island, N.Y., killing all 230 people aboard. Its backers say
the change in the law would also help those who lost relatives in
the crashes of Swissair Flight 111 in 1998 and Egyptair Flight 990
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to vote soon to approve the change, which
is part of a compromise on aviation finance that House and Senate
conferees agreed to on Tuesday. The provision lets families sue for
``loss of care, comfort and companionship.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1920 law, the Death on the High Seas Act, families
were limited to collecting the value of lost wages; if the
passenger was a child or a retired person, or if the relative suing
did not rely on the passenger's income, then the family generally
could not collect any money. Korean Air Lines successfully used the
law to limit the amount it paid after one of its planes was shot
down by a Soviet fighter plane in 1983 over the Sea of Japan. TWA
is seeking to use the law, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news for the families,'' said Frank Carven, a
director of the TWA Flight 800 Association, whose sister and nephew
died on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Death on the High Seas law originally covered deaths beyond
one marine league, which is three nautical miles, the common
definition of territorial waters in the 1920s. In June 1998, Judge
Robert W. Sweet of U.S. District Court in Manhattan ruled that when
President Ronald Reagan extended U.S. territorial waters to 12
miles in 1988, the definition of ``high seas'' moved out that far,
too. TWA has appealed his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provision approved by the Senate, the families of
victims in crashes within 12 miles of shore could use state laws to
pursue claims against airlines. Where to sue is a complicated
question in crashes, but families can often go to court in the
jurisdiction in which the passenger lived, or the place from which
the plane departed. Beyond 12 miles, the families would be allowed
to sue in federal court for loss of care, comfort and
companionship.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Kreindler, a lawyer whose firm represents the families
of 86 passengers, said that the law would push the airline and its
insurance company to offer more generous settlements. ``The
defendants in TWA 800 know they're going to pay,'' he said, and
have appealed Sweet's decision in an effort to delay payments.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark E. Abels, a TWA spokesman, said that the change in the
law, presuming the House passes it and President Clinton signs it,
is ``not a major concern as far as we're concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no finding of liability against TWA, and we don't
anticipate that there will be,'' he said. ``In order to
successfully sue, there has to be a finding of willful malfeasance,
and there has been no finding by anybody of any malfeasance on the
part of TWA, willful or otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash is still under investigation. Lawyers say
that the airline and Boeing, the manufacturer, are potentially
liable.
</P>
<P>
   Abels said the company had appealed the judge's decision because
it did not think the judge could retroactively change the terms of
the 1920 law to conform with the later policy on territorial
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Kreindler said that none of the cases had been settled yet;
Abels said that some had, but that he would not say how many.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the lobbying for the change in the law was done by Hans
Ephraimson-Abt, the father of a young woman who died on KAL 007,
and the law was not backdated to cover that crash. ``We did all the
work, and we wound up with nothing,'' he said. ``After 17 years,
they are told that other families, with crashes a few years later,
are entitled to something, but they're just thrown on the heap.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kreindler said the new provision would also affect families who
lost relatives on Swissair 111 and EgyptAir 990. The Swissair
flight crashed five miles off the Nova Scotia coast on Sept. 2,
1998, killing 229 people. EgyptAir 990 crashed about 50 miles out
at sea last Oct. 31, killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   A main backer of the change in the law was Rep. Donald L.
Sherwood, a Republican whose district in Pennsylvania includes
Montoursville. Sixteen teen-age members of the town's high school
French Club died on Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where a loved one died, on land or at sea, should not
determine the legal rights of family members in a court of law,''
Sherwood wrote in letters to colleagues supporting the change. ``No
parent should be told by our nation's legal system that longitude
and latitude will determine the value of their child.'' &QL;

MRS. CLINTON CRITICIZES CITY FOR MISSING GUN SAFETY TALKS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized New York City on
Wednesday for failing to join more than two dozen cities, counties
and states that are trying to force gun manufacturers to improve
gun safety and tighten controls over gun sales through legal
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changes in the way guns are designed and manufactured,
marketed and distributed could save many lives in the future,''
Clinton said in an appearance at a lower Manhattan office building
with state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who is negotiating with
the gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, along with representatives from San Francisco, New
Orleans and other states and cities, has met several times since
last summer with gun manufacturers, asking them to add trigger
locks or other devices to guns they make to prevent them from being
fired accidentally, a spokesman for the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   And the attorney general has asked the manufacturers to stop
distributing guns to dealers who have a history of selling to
criminals, said Scott R. Brown, Spitzer's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lost opportunity because New York City has
not joined in this effort,'' Clinton said. ``Probably the people in
New York City have as much or more to gain from such a code of
conduct and changes in the way that the gun manufacturers do
business as any people anywhere in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in New York,
did not mention her probable Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. But Howard Wolfson, her campaign spokesman, said after
her remarks that Giuliani is to blame for the city's failure to
participate in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, Giuliani's press secretary, later rejected the
criticism. ``If Mrs. Clinton lived in New York City, she would know
that it is the corporation counsel that analyzes these issues'' and
would decide whether the city should join in such an effort, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna B. Goodman, a spokeswoman for Michael D. Hess, the
corporation counsel, said the city has not sued gun manufacturers
because it is still trying to assess the likelihood of winning such
a case. She said the city is prepared to participate with Spitzer,
a Democrat, in negotiations with the gun manufacturers, but it has
not been invited to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a separate appearance Wednesday before The Gay and
Lesbian Independent Democrats, a group in the West Village,
detailed her positions on a number of gay-related issues. She said
she supports extending health and other benefits associated with
marriage to domestic partners, allowing people to join the military
regardless of their sexual orientation and national legislation
that would outlaw so-called hate crimes, Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Clinton said she would back national legislation
that would bar an employer from discriminating against a person
based on sexual orientation.

IN SMALL PRINT ARE CLUES TO BUSH'S DELEGATE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after their most tumultuous primary in memory, it was
clear Wednesday that New York Republicans' convoluted way of
awarding presidential delegates helped George W. Bush _ and equally
clear that even Bush supporters found that system wanting.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of the popular vote went to Bush's delegates,
to about 44 percent for Sen. John McCain's. Yet that tight contest
was not reflected in the race for the delegates, which, based on
unofficial returns, Bush appeared to have won, 67 delegates to 26.
</P>
<P>
   Such odd totals capped the state's first truly contested
Republican presidential primary in 20 years. It saw McCain surge
from far back in the polls to overtake Bush in a few weeks, then
slip under a barrage of negative television and radio ads. Turnout
on the Republican side was about 25 percent, far higher than the 14
percent in Bob Dole's lopsided victory over Steve Forbes in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island, long a bulwark of the state's Republican Party,
went heavily for McCain, defying a party establishment that, from
Gov. George E. Pataki down to local committee members, had almost
unanimously backed Bush. Politicians and voters alike interpreted
the Long Island vote as a continuation of the revolt against the
Nassau County Republican machine that last year gave control of the
County Legislature to Democrats for the first time _ a revolt that
spilled on Tuesday into Suffolk County, as well, with McCain
victories there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for a difference in the Republican Party,''
William Herbst said after voting for McCain in New Hyde Park. ``As
far as I'm concerned, it's the party of the patronage system,
especially in Nassau County.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush ran strongest upstate, while the two were nearly evenly
matched in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Republican primary was really 31 mini-contests: In
each of the state's congressional districts, each candidate had a
slate of three people running to be delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Voters cast their ballots not directly for the candidates, but
for delegates, whose names appeared in large type, with the
candidates' names in much smaller print below. Each voter could
vote for as many as three delegates, and most voted for slates,
essentially using all three of their votes for the same
presidential candidate. But some split their tickets, picking
delegate candidates from more than one slate.
</P>
<P>
   Most Bush delegates were well-known elected officials and party
leaders, while McCain's were nearly all political neophytes.
</P>
<P>
   In district after district that McCain carried, overall, Bush
managed to capture one of the three delegate slots, when that
delegate was a prominent figure: County Executive Robert Gaffney
and Rep. Rick A. Lazio in Suffolk County; county Republican
chairman Joseph Mondello in Nassau County; Councilman Thomas V.
Ognibene in Queens; Ronald J. D'Angelo, a local party leader and
perennial candidate in Brooklyn; and state Sen. Hugh Farley in the
Schenectady-Albany region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican primary voters are more inclined to be supportive
of their local elected officials and trust their choices of a
presidential candidate than someone they've never heard of,'' said
Zenia Mucha, a top adviser to Pataki, who helped coordinate Bush's
campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain supporters said the ticket-splitting showed that some
voters simply did not understand the ballot. And Mucha conceded
that perhaps the system should be changed, adding that the
questions raised about it were ``probably a very good, healthy
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians who ran as Bush delegates found themselves in
close races, facing the prospect of a loss that could damage their
prestige. ``I think we're going to change this system, because no
one wants to go through it again,'' said a Republican elected
official who was elected a Bush delegate. ``We took a lot of heat
for it, some of us dodged a bullet, and some of us didn't dodge
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most prominent downstate Republicans, state Sens.
Dean G. Skelos of Long Island and Roy M. Goodman of Manhattan, lost
their races to be Bush delegates, though Republican leaders said
the party would most likely find some role for them at the national
convention in Philadelphia this summer. Returns showed Mondello
barely hanging onto a delegate slot.
</P>
<P>
   The district-by-district voting meant that each district counted
for the same number of delegates, no matter how many Republicans it
held. In the 16th District in the Bronx, it took barely 500 votes
to be elected a delegate; in the 22nd District upstate, it took
more than 24,000.

BOSTON TUNNEL PROJECT TO DIG DEEPER INTO STATE'S POCKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Grilled until their ears glowed pink, the top overseers
of Boston's ``Big Dig'' tried to explain to Massachusetts lawmakers
Wednesday how the project, the largest public works endeavor under
way in the country, came to be $1.4 billion over budget, and why
they did not disclose the overrun earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was billed as just a fact-finding session, but it
also afforded a chance for lawmakers to demand, in an echo of
public sentiment, ``How (italics)could(end italics) you let this
happen?''
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, of course, that what managers call the
most complex urban infrastructure project in American history, a
scheme to sink Boston's raised Central Artery underground and
connect it to Logan Airport, would run over budget, even if that
budget, before the current overrun, was a monumental $10.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Bostonians were nonetheless more than a little surprised
last month when the media suddenly announced the projected $1.4
billion overrun, because James Kerasiotes, the project's supreme
boss and chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, had been
saying for so long that the project would be on time, finished in
2004, and on budget.
</P>
<P>
   Recriminations followed. Federal auditors trooped to town.
Securities and Exchange Commission investigators contacted the
state treasurer. The United States Transportation secretary, Rodney
Slater, issued warnings of freezes on the federal part of Big Dig
financing.
</P>
<P>
   And, while no one was suggesting that the project be halted when
it was already two-thirds done, its engineering achievements were
suddenly obscured in a cloud of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   At the verbal whipping session Wednesday before lawmakers,
Kerasiotes apologized less for the overrun than for how people
found out about it, in media reports released before he could
develop ideas for a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one thing keeps me up at night,'' he said, ``and believe
me, I've had a few sleepless nights over the past month, it's that
we should have done a better job explaining this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not at all our intent to mislead,'' he said. ``There
would be no gain in doing so because the facts are the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Those facts, as presented and picked apart for hours Wednesday,
amount to $1.4 billion in various unexpectedly high costs _ from
changes in construction contracts to a longer-than-anticipated need
for consultants _ that, over the last year, project managers
gradually came to realize could not be offset by other savings.
Kerasiotes described how he saved $500 million here and $100
million there in the project's early years, but cost-cutting
opportunities shrank, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All along, he said, project managers had ``pushed back hard'' on
cost pressures, cut staff and looked everywhere for savings, but
some things, like construction quality, could not be sacrificed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project by any measure has been a successful project,''
he maintained, particularly for one so complex that it employs
4,000 workers and is now, at peak construction, costing $4 million
a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very complicated,'' said Robert A. Havern III, chairman
of the Senate Transportation Committee, who noted that he had
learned all about cost pressures when he redid his kitchen. ``But
the accounting is not complicated. Revenues must match
expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing, said Sen. Mark C. Montigny, a Democrat and
chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, ``gives us a
chance not only to form a constructive critique, but ultimately, we
have to decide where the money is coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the administration, and the project's many other
federal and state chiefs, had been reveling in its on-time
achievements. It has already opened a new tunnel, to Logan Airport,
and will ultimately link that new tunnel to the Massachusetts
Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The project, now at $12.2 billion, is much more than a mere
tunnel, of course. When it is done, it will have torn down the
elevated artery on which traffic runs _ or rather, usually crawls _
through the center of town, and replaced it with an elaborate
underground highway system. The project also incluses two bridges
across the Charles River, north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In the project's no-small-trick category: building the
underground highway right underneath where the elevated highway
continues to run; tunneling under a working railway line and
freezing the earth all around it so that the rails do not sink;
threading the highway above or below other existing rail, subway
and utility lines, both on dry-land sites and in watery spots;
installing monitoring systems smart enough to pick up and solve
anything from an accident to a fire on more than four miles of
underground road.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the project's managers must pull off another kind
of trick, the political kind: restoring the project's credibility
and public support.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes promised to overhaul the project's reporting system
to make sure more information was shared with lawmakers and other
monitors. And he did show signs of reform Wednesday when his
managers tried to convince lawmakers that really and truly, the
$1.4 billion overrun was all they expected until the end of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Are you, Kerasiotes was asked, drawing a line in the sand at
$1.4 billion?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think from past experience that would be a mistake for me to
do,'' he said.

NBA REPORT: TEAMS ARE NOT SMILING AT LOCKER ROOM CAMERAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the National Basketball Association began an experiment
nearly two months ago of having coaches wear miniature microphones
during nationally televised games, the idea was to give fans a
perspective seldom seen in professional sports. The hope for the
NBA. and its broadcast partners, NBC and Turner Sports, was to
increase sagging ratings by using a fan-friendly device.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the NBA has angered players and coaches, who say the
use of microphones during games is intrusive. They are more peeved
at the notion of an unmanned camera being used in locker rooms at
halftime, which the league hopes to implement by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   The growing debate is whether the NBA is revealing too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong,'' Patrick Ewing, the players association
president, said after being informed of the plan to film teams
during halftime. ``We did not agree to it with the owners during
our labor negotiations and it's changing the work conditions.
Anyone can see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, NBC telecasts are down 14 percent from last season's
lockout-tainted season.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley refused to wear a microphone during last Sunday's NBC
telecast against the Lakers. The league decided Wednesday not to
fine Riley because of the short notice the Heat coach had before he
was informed he would have to wear a microphone. But beginning this
weekend, any coach who balks will incur fines beginning at
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very intrusive to the job of coaching,'' Knicks
Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I think it negatively impacts the
coach, because you now have to really monitor what you say.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, Riley, Larry Bird and Jerry Sloan have echoed the
same sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a concern about fan interest,'' Van Gundy said. ``And
everybody in the NBA wants it to be an appealing product. But when
fans stop me to talk about the NBA, my sense is that they're not
really concerned about microphones, having a camera in the locker
room, the media have more access to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see great players, great teams, great rivalries,
great basketball and have great people for their kids to emulate.
That's my sense what the fans want. But there is obviously a
different sense by the people who make those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea to use microphones was the brainchild of the league's
entertainment division, which has often used the device in its
video productions. But many people in the league wonder if it is
not an overreaction to a decline in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich ushered in the new era when he
was miked for a game on Christmas day. Since then, NBC's top
broadcasting team has used a microphone on at least one coach and
the lead referee during its weekend games. During the All-Star Game
last month, the two head coaches, Van Gundy and Jackson, were
miked, along with five players.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two weeks, cameras will be positioned in several
locker rooms ``on a voluntary basis,'' Russ Granik, the league's
deputy commissioner, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the coaches have some fair and legitimate concerns,''
he said. ``But hopefully they'll be comfortable with it as time
goes by. The goal is not get into strategy sessions, it is to let
fans get inside the locker room and see what's going on. It's a
judgment by people in that end of the business that this is
something that can enhance our telecasts. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, has labeled the
process ``like Big Brother'' and said he is considering taking the
matter before an arbitrator if the league does not quickly address
the players' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is they just can't change work conditions,''
Hunter said. ``What purpose does it serve to show a bunch of guys
sitting around the locker room?''
</P>
<P>
   Granik said he did not believe the league was violating the
collective bargaining agreement and said he planned to listen to
the union's concerns. He said the NBA would continue to use
microphones during at least one NBC telecast each weekend and one
game per week on either TNT or TBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this just improves the telecasts from the standpoint
of fans,'' he said. ``Wherever the ratings may be, if we can make
things better for the fans, they'll be more likely to watch
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Only snippets of conversation are used for each telecast, with
most choice comments being edited out by the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to be more cognizant of what you say when
you're miked,'' Van Gundy said. ``Even though they may not use it
on air, somebody hears it in some truck, who can then repeat it to
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is not the end, either. This is just going to keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy added: ``We're in the basketball business and that's
the problem right there. It's not show business. It's basketball.
That's why people watch.''

RELIEVED MARTIN IS READY TO FOCUS ON GAME

<P>
   Casey Martin hopes that his best golf is still ahead and that
his legal battles are behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after a federal appeals court upheld Martin's right to
use a cart in PGA Tour competition, he spoke publicly Wednesday for
the first time about the decision. The Tour, which has not decided
if it will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, is expected to
announce its plans sometime after its policy board meeting next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't shock me if they pursued it,'' Martin said during
a teleconference with reporters. ``It would disappoint me, but it
wouldn't shock me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 27, has Klippel-Trenauney-Weber syndrome, a circulatory
disorder that causes severe pain and swelling in his right leg. He
won his lawsuit against the Tour in February 1998, when U.S.
Magistrate Thomas Coffin granted an injunction that required the
Tour to furnish him with a cart.
</P>
<P>
   Had the appeals court decision gone against him, Martin said, he
would have appealed to the Supreme Court. Instead, he can focus on
golf Thursday when he competes in the first round of the Honda
Classic in Coral Springs, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bigger relief than I thought it would be,'' Martin said
of the appellate decision. ``It's not like I thought about it every
day, but now that it's over it's a huge relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin recalled meeting with Commissioner Tim Finchem late last
year during an orientation for Tour rookies. Martin said Finchem
sounded confident that the appeals court would rule in the Tour's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he felt the longer it went, the better it was for
their side,'' Martin said. ``I was concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his leg has been sore all year, Martin hopes to play in
about 25 tournaments. He has played in five, with his best finish
coming in last month's Touchstone Energy Tucson Open, in which he
tied for 17th place.
</P>
<P>
   Martin will also play next week in the Bay Hill Invitational,
whose host, Arnold Palmer, had testified against Martin at the
trial. ``The irony is that he gave me a special exemption for his
tournament,'' Martin said of Palmer. ``It should be an interesting
week, but I'm grateful and looking forward to meeting with him.''

AS INVESTORS BALK, YANKEENETS REDUCES LOAN AND RAISES RATE

   NEW YORK _ Resistance from investors forced the company that
owns the New York Yankees baseball team and the New Jersey Nets
basketball team to cut back on the amount of money it wanted to
borrow and to increase the interest rate it will pay.
</P>
<P>
   The company, YankeeNets LLC, said Wednesday that it would issue
$200 million in seven-year bonds paying interest of 12.75 percent.
It originally wanted to borrow $250 million at 11.75 percent,
though the rate discussed with investors had risen to 12.25 percent
by last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the interest rate and the need of YankeeNets, we have
limited the offering to $200 million at an interest rate of 12.75
percent,'' Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for YankeeNets and a
director, said Wednesday. He said the company was ``pleased with
the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein had no comment on how the cut in the amount being
borrowed would affect the uses of the proceeds from the borrowing.
The preliminary offering document had said that only $15 million
would go to operations of the two teams, with $80 million set aside
to pay interest for the first three years and most of the rest
being distributed to the owners of YankeeNets.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the managing general partner of the
Yankees, had been scheduled to get about $40 million from the
proceeds of the offering and a related sale of a stake in the
company to unidentified investors. The cut in the size of the bond
offering appears likely to reduce his take by about $8 million or
more. Former owners of the Nets, who had to borrow large amounts of
money to complete the merger of the two teams and who planned to
use the distribution to repay those loans, will also receive less
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   First Union Securities was the lead underwriter for the
offering, with Merrill Lynch as co-manager.

<P>
   To most moderns, Guillaume de Machaut is a distant figure,
familiar only from textbooks. But the New York violin dealer
Dietmar Machold has a more personal response to the medieval
composer: he calls Machaut an ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   The instruments that pass through Machold Rare Violins, across
Broadway from Lincoln Center, are a far cry from the fiedels and
vielles of Machaut's day. Machold's recent clients are said to
include Vladimir Spivakov, Midori and Hilary Hahn, who each, by one
report in a famously tight-lipped business, may have paid as much
as $5 million for their Old Master violins. Machold declined to
comment on these matters.
</P>
<P>
   When he is not in New York _ or at one of the firm's offices in
Tokyo, Zurich, Vienna or Bremen, Germany _ Machold relaxes at
Schloss Eichbuchl, his home in Austria. It is in part a medieval
castle, its oldest portions having been dated to 1348, when Machaut
was in midcareer.
</P>
<P>
   Its owners have included the youngest sister of Napoleon and a
daughter of Marie Antoinette, and it is big enough to house
Machold's expansive collection of antique sports cars. A
Francophile whose literary preferences run to the 19th century,
Machold owns several recordings of Machaut's music.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you need a quiet moment in your day,'' he said,
``listening to the Machaut Mass provides the reflection you
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The family business goes back five generations, to 1859, when a
German Machold married into a family of luthiers. In the same
decade, several Macholds left for America. A member of that branch,
Roland Machold, lives in Princeton and was last year named
treasurer of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Machold, a genealogy maven, traveled to Germany in 1992
to chart the family's roots in the Thuringian village of Oelse (now
incorporated into Katzhutte, near Ilmenau). He asked a restaurant
proprietor whether anyone in town was named Machold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Yes, about 50, including the mayor,' so I knew I'd
hit the mother lode,'' Machold said. Over seven centuries, written
records seem to have strayed irretrievably. But Roland Machold's
conversations with the clan confirmed information that had come
down through both his and Dietmar's families: the Macholds were of
French origin but had fled religious persecution; musicians
blossomed regularly on the family tree, including a 16th-century
Johann Machold who rates an entry in The New Grove Dictionary of
Music and Musicians; and until recently, many still spelled their
name ``Machault,'' as did, everyone said, their famous ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   After enduring a reporter's disquisition on Machaut's
fascination with isorhythm, a system involving overlapping rhythmic
and melodic patterns, Roland Machold said that it sounded a lot
like what his son, Rob, was up to.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Machold, a biologist, spends his evenings playing drums in
avant-garde bands and obsessing about theoretical relationships
between music and mathematics. And sure enough, reached at his home
in Brooklyn, Rob Machold described a ``rhythmic slide rule'' he
recently invented to illustrate complicated superimpositions of
rhythms in various metric contexts.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting a rhythmically obsessed French composer of the 14th
century to a violin dealer and a theoretically inclined drummer in
the 21st requires a measure of faith. But as we celebrate what is
(for lack of documentary evidence) taken to be the 700th
anniversary year of Machaut's birth, we may choose to believe that
his legacy lives on _ in New York, no less _ through his notes, his
words and even his DNA.

 Lyle Rexer is the author of ``The Antiquarian Avant-Garde: The New
Wave in Old Process Photography,'' to be published next year by
Abrams.  
 By LYLE REXER

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the moment in 1839 when Louis Jacques Mande
Daguerre announced that he could capture an image of the seen world
on a silver surface, the daguerreotype both threatened and
enthralled visual artists with equal force.
</P>
<P>
   The first form of photography, it drove an industry of
miniaturists virtually out of business. Yet its delicate precision
fascinated such painters as Eugene Delacroix, who collected
daguerreotypes and recommended them to his students as an aid for
improving their rendering of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Both Daguerre and the man who brought news of his process to the
United States, the inventor of the telegraph, Samuel F.B. Morse,
were painters, and they viewed the ``silver canvas'' not as a
threat to art but as a new art form.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century and a half after the daguerreotype's demise as
a popular process, it is being revived by Chuck Close, who sees in
its special qualities untapped possibilities of expression. In a
collaboration with the contemporary daguerreotypist Jerry Spagnoli,
Close has produced an extensive series of daguerreotype
self-portraits, as well as front and back views of nudes in
close-up, for an exhibition at Pace/MacGill Gallery in Manhattan
that opens Wednesday and runs through April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Their effect is as unexpected as opening a beaded purse and
finding a cell phone. In a photo session at Spagnoli's studio in
Chelsea recently, Close said, ``I am trying to banish the nostalgia
from something old to make it about our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinventing the past is nothing new for Close. In the 1960s and
'70s, he revolutionized the idea of the painted portrait by
creating images of himself and his friends in overwhelming
dimension: the mug shot writ large. He also led a movement to erase
the boundary between painting and photography by basing his work on
large-format Polaroid photographs and eliminating any trace of a
brush stroke from his canvases.
</P>
<P>
   His early airbrush techniques inspired the development of the
ink jet printer. He saw his first daguerreotypes at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art while he was still in graduate school in
the '60s, and he never forgot them. ``I have always attempted to
create images that deliver the maximum amount of information about
the subject,'' he said. ``I was fascinated by the clarity and
detail of the daguerreotype. Nothing gets lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The daguerreotype's ability to capture fine details was the
source of its instant popularity. Within two years of its
demonstration in 1839, the streets of Paris were crowded with
tripod-toting picture takers. The cumbersome cameras sold like hot
cakes as painters laid aside their brushes and chemists their
retorts to become ``daguerrean operators,'' as they were called.
</P>
<P>
   The daguerreotype even inspired one commentator to cry, ``Steel
engravers, copper engravers and etchers, drink up your aquafortis
and die! ... All nature shall paint herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the daguerreotype's chemistry is complicated, the
process of making one involves only a few steps. A silver-surfaced
copper plate, usually 8-by-10 inches or smaller, is carefully
polished, then coated with a solution of iodine and bromine to make
it light sensitive. It is exposed in the camera and then developed
by ``fuming'' with mercury vapor. The result is a one-of-a-kind
image rather than a negative for reproducing photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Its visual effect is unlike any other photographic process. In
conventional photographs, the silver particles are embedded in the
paper and absorb light. In essence, they ``stain'' the paper. In a
daguerreotype, the silver crystals sit on a reflective surface and
don't absorb light but scatter it. To see the image, the viewer has
to tilt the plate until it is at the proper angle to reveal the
pattern of scattering.
</P>
<P>
   This inconvenience is one reason the daguerreotype fell out of
favor, and also why it is so hard to reproduce in print. In
Spagnoli's opinion, a daguerreotype is not a photograph at all but
an ``optical system'' involving the plate, the viewer and light.
</P>
<P>
   This paradox of precision and evanescence also attracted Close.
``A daguerreotype has a dimensionality, a depth that makes it very
close to a hologram,'' he said. In the forthcoming Pace exhibition,
his holograms and daguerreotypes are exhibited in the same room.
The exhibition also includes large digital ink-jet photographic
prints.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work is all about focus and scale,'' he said. ``The closer
you get to a daguerreotype, the more you see. In some ways it's the
opposite of a painting, which breaks down into brush strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   But admiring a daguerreotype and making one are very different
things. The commercial replacement of silver plates by paper
photographs, which could be easily reproduced, meant that by the
1990s only a handful of people in the United States knew how to
make daguerreotypes. Close would never have begun the project if
Colin Westerbeck, an associate curator of photography at the Art
Institute of Chicago, had not had an interest in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he used a grant from the Lannan Foundation to bring
Close together with Grant Romer, director of conservation at the
George Eastman House. Romer is one of that handful of daguerrean
operators. ``The daguerreotype is a direct positive image like the
Polaroids on which Chuck's paintings are based,'' said Westerbeck.
``I knew its detail would grab his interest. Besides, he loves any
medium that entails knotty technical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The results, however, were maddeningly inconsistent. One reason
was the nature of the process. The silver surface has to be
unblemished, the mix of chemicals and timing just right. As
Spagnoli lamented: ``You can be going along blithely convinced that
everything is wonderful and in the end have a complete failure
because of some subtle error. There's no way to monitor your
progress.'' No wonder daguerreotype studios guarded their
techniques and innovations. In addition, the long exposure required
for a daguerreotype increases the likelihood of movement blurring
the image. As Close said, ``Bodies breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Spagnoli, an artist and photographer turned
daguerreotypist. Westerbeck saw Spagnoli's work and suggested
another attempt. Spagnoli did not say so, but he was not sure he
could achieve success in the quantity Close wanted _ more than 40
full-plate images. But just before their sessions began last
summer, Spagnoli improved his technique of polishing and
sensitizing the plates and managed to eliminate much of the
inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the two men work is to step back into a world of
hands-on artistry and speculative tinkering. While Close directs
the arrangement of the model against a black background cloth,
Spagnoli polishes the plates with a long buffing stick coated with
fine red polishing powder. He disappears into a small darkroom to
coat the plates, and Close says, ``I am used to collaborating in my
work, and Jerry opens doors for me.'' Then he adds with a laugh,
``He's so wedded to the ritual of the process that if I'm not here
to watch him prepare the plates, I feel guilty, as if I don't
deserve to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   The camera is a large-format, wooden machine with a fixed lens
and a cloth hood. Spagnoli, who has organized an exhibition of
antique daguerreotypes currently on view at the Sarah Morthland
Gallery, had to build most of his equipment, including the
container for mercury developing. The fumes are deadly, and it took
him a long time to overcome his qualms about safety before he began
to learn the process.
</P>
<P>
   Both Spagnoli and Close dart in and out from under the hood to
check the focus. Close is concerned that as much of his subject as
possible be in the focal plane to avoid any softening of the image,
not an easy task given the dramatic contours of the nude human body
in close-up.
</P>
<P>
   Early daguerreotypists were limited to working with natural
light, but Spagnoli has developed a technique for using
high-intensity strobe lights that captures the image
instantaneously and increases its sharpness. Uncertainty, however,
is a constant companion. One of Close's current subjects appeared
light complexioned, but her skin contained slight reddish pigments.
Since the silver surface is sensitive to certain light wavelengths,
her image darkened so much that her tattoos, which Close especially
wanted to capture, nearly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the finished 8-by-10-inch daguerreotypes, old and new
collide. After being developed, the images emerge gradually, like
ghosts caught unawares in daylight. Shiny, light-reflecting
surfaces like those of jewelry and fingernails appear first, then
the rest of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Close has deliberately focused on torsos, and at first glance
their physical clarity seems painful. It is easy to sympathize with
the poet of 1841 who wrote of the daguerreotype, ``Truth is
unpleasant/to prince and to peasant.'' Yet most 19th-century nudes
have a soft, sculptural quality, closer in spirit to Fragonard and
Boucher. And they have heads. The dispassionate, almost clinical
style of Close's anonymous torsos betrays an unmistakably modern
sensibility. And yet as the viewer moves from side to side, the
shimmering surfaces catch different colors _ reds and blues _ and
the bodies seem to come to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They involve us intimately in the poignancy and elusiveness of
seeing,'' Close said.
</P>
<P>
   That poignancy may also spring from his subject _ bodies of
people Close knows, ranging in age from the early 20s to the late
60s. In 1988, Close nearly died from a collapsed spinal artery. Now
confined to a wheelchair, he has a heightened sense of both the
frailty and majesty of the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``A body is a road map of a person's life,'' he said, ``as
unique and expressive as any face. The wrinkles and effects of
gravity are beautiful.'' He added, ``This work is my celebration of
the body, and the daguerreotype is the prefect medium of that
celebration.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the pantheon of white-collar criminals, Sholam Weiss, a
rumpled businessman from New York, has earned his place among the
giants.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Orlando, Fla., Weiss received what is believed to
be the longest federal prison term ever imposed: 845 years. He was
sentenced on racketeering, money laundering and fraud charges, all
from his central role in an immense fraud scheme that siphoned $450
million from an insurance company, leading to its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But Weiss, 46, was not around to hear the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In October, while a jury in Orlando was deliberating on the
93-count indictment against him, the burly, bearded Weiss vanished.
Now, he can be found only on the FBI's Web site,
www.fbi.gov/mostwant/fugitive/janweiss.htm, where he is featured on
a wanted poster that offers a $95,000 reward for information
leading to his capture. Insurance regulators are offering an
additional $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   That Weiss, who built a lucrative plumbing supply business in
Borough Park, Brooklyn, became both a criminal mastermind and
international fugitive may seem curious to the casual observer. But
the authorities say that this father of five and grandfather of
three is no casual crook. Rather, they say, he has emerged as one
of the more gifted criminals, with a knack for fraud, fleeing and
hiding stolen millions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the federal authorities say they believe that Weiss has
more than enough money to live a comfortable life as a fugitive,
having fled with $25 million to $30 million of the insurance
company's money. The FBI has received some reports that place him
in Israel and others that put him in the United States. Some
evidence also suggests that Weiss, whose home is in Monsey, N.Y.,
could be in Austria, Brazil or Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weiss' corruption and dishonesty know no end,'' Judith K.
Hunt, an assistant U.S. attorney in Orlando, wrote in court papers
filed last month. ``Weiss is in hiding, enjoying his millions in
ill-gotten gains, while his minions face extended periods of
incarceration. The sophistication and scope of his frauds is truly
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheme itself _ in which a series of numbingly complex
mortgage and stock frauds were used to loot the National Heritage
Life Insurance Co. _ attracted little attention outside Florida,
where the majority of the insurer's mostly elderly policy-holders
live. But the federal authorities said it ranked as the largest
insurance company failure caused by criminal acts in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Weiss, 15 business executives and lawyers from
Arizona, Texas, Illinois and New York have either pleaded guilty or
been convicted in the fraud case in the last four years, and
several are already serving long prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The federal authorities say the fraud began in the early 1990s,
when the group of businessmen and lawyers effectively hijacked the
insurer. Using an artful variation on a simple check-kiting scheme,
they bought the company with a check and then, once they had taken
over, simply lent themselves the money to cover the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   After taking control in 1993, the authorities said, Weiss and
several others stoked National Heritage into a juggernaut of fraud.
They bought up worthless stocks and mortgages in a series of deals
that sucked hundreds of millions of dollars out of the insurer.
Much of the money _ in cash _ just vanished. Millions more ended up
in accounts controlled by Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   When and where Weiss picked up his criminal skills is unclear.
He grew up in Borough Park, where his father ran a fruit stand.
Educated in a yeshiva, where he spoke Yiddish, Weiss finished the
equivalent of high school, but he did not learn English until he
was in his late teens. He began doing construction work as a young
man, and bought Windsor Plumbing Supply in 1974, when he was 20.
According to Weiss' testimony at trial, the company was then
bringing in about $275,000 a year. By 1986, Windsor was doing $20
million in business, with four locations in Brooklyn and a vast
showroom on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Weiss attributed it
all to long hours and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the decade, Windsor had spiraled into debt and
bankruptcy and eventually closed. By that time, Weiss had moved his
family to Monsey, and in 1989, after 14 years of marriage, he and
his wife, Goldie, separated.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor's failure apparently taught Weiss so much that he
started hiring himself out as a bankruptcy specialist, advising
other businessmen on how to work out their debts. It was then, in
1992, the authorities said, that Weiss met some of the people with
whom he would plunder National Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One was Michael D. Blutrich, a lawyer who was an owner of the
topless club Scores on East 60th Street, which was then controlled
by the Gambino organized crime family. Blutrich also served as the
outside counsel for National Heritage. He later admitted his role
in defrauding the insurer and a variety of other crimes, and became
a government witness.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Blutrich and his partner, Lyle K. Pfeffer, Weiss
became a regular visitor to Scores. There, he discussed business
with Blutrich.
</P>
<P>
   Both Blutrich and Pfeffer are now in the government's witness
security program, and the club has declared bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The National Heritage frauds were not the first time Weiss and
Blutrich faced legal trouble together. In 1994, Weiss was indicted
on mail fraud charges that he had falsely claimed that more than $1
million worth of bathtubs had been damaged in a 1986 fire at a
company warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   He went to trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where
Blutrich gave false information to federal prosecutors in an effort
to prevent Weiss' indictment. But Blutrich's efforts, which he
admitted to when he pleaded guilty to a series of crimes, were for
naught. Weiss was convicted and sentenced to eight months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who represented Weiss during his trial in Orlando,
Joel Hirschhorn of Miami, filed papers to withdraw from the case
after his client fled, and seems to wish he could forget the
episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall that name,'' he recently joked when a reporter
asked him about Weiss. But during the trial, his representation was
aggressive, despite a sometimes difficult Weiss, who was often
heard yelling at his co-defendants in the courthouse hallways or
talking on his cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Such was his client's churlish behavior that Hirschhorn felt
compelled to point out to the jury during his summation that
``Sholam Weiss is not on trial for being rich or rude.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' courtroom demeanor endeared him to neither judge, jury
nor courthouse officials. And courtroom observers were speculating
that Weiss would flee long before the October Sunday when he made
his routine call to check in with pretrial services and then
disappeared, jumping the $500,000 bond secured by his wife's house
in Monsey.
</P>
<P>
   At Weiss' sentencing on the National Heritage charges on Feb.
15, Judge Patricia C. Fawsett of Federal District Court in Orlando
said that given the magnitude and repeated nature of the fraudulent
acts, he should be removed permanently from society. Fawsett
devised the mammoth term by stacking one 20-year count on top of
another, because under federal sentencing guidelines, she could not
impose a life term.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not content with the prison time, Fawsett also fined
Weiss $123,399,910 and ordered him to pay $125,016,656 in
restitution to the policy-holders of National Heritage, which is in
receivership under the auspices of Donna L. Williams, the insurance
commissioner in Delaware, where National Heritage was chartered.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' office has also obtained a $339 million judgment
against Weiss in state Supreme Court in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm of O'Keefe &AMP; Lindgren of White Plains, N.Y.,
retained by Williams, has already recovered $175 million to $200
million from other defendants involved in National Heritage cases
and related civil lawsuits, according to Thomas K. Lindgren, a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   And the firm seems to be focusing as much energy on finding what
Lindgren says are Weiss' millions as the government is on finding
Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 priority at the present time,'' Lindgren said, ``is
to recover from Sholam Weiss the hundreds of millions of dollars of
ill-gotten gains in order to return them to the policy-holders.''

MILITIA LEADER ACQUITTED OF PLOTTING TO KIDNAP BOY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bo Gritz, the former Green Beret commando and a leader of the
far-right militia movement, was acquitted Wednesday of charges that
he tried to kidnap a young boy from the parking lot of a middle
school in Suffield, Conn., in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A jury cleared Gritz and his co-defendant, Sheldon Robinson, of
all charges, including attempted kidnapping, conspiracy and
attempted custodial interference. They had been accused of plotting
the kidnapping of one of two boys whose mother had lost a bitter
custody dispute with her ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, in Connecticut Superior Court in Enfield, returned the
verdicts Wednesday after deliberating for more than two days and
apparently concluding that the prosecution had failed to prove that
Gritz (pronounced GRITES) had intended to do anything more than
draw attention to the custody case.
</P>
<P>
   As the verdict was read, Gritz, 61, a retired Army colonel who
is the host of a syndicated radio program, stood beside his lawyer,
David Kritzman, gave members of the jury a military salute and told
them, ``Thank you,'' Kritzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz, whose full name is James G. Gritz, and his son, James R.
Gritz, were arrested on Sept. 30, 1996, while sitting in a car in
the parking lot of McAlister Middle School in Suffield. The car
belonged to Linda M. Wiegand, the mother of two boys who attended
the school.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the car, the police found photographs of the boys, a
school floor plan, a class schedule and two-way radios. Wiegand had
appeared on Bo Gritz's radio program and accused her ex-husband of
sexually abusing the boys. Prosecutors accused Gritz of planning a
rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   Kritzman argued that his client had simply wished to publicize
Wiegand's plight.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, he said he thought the jury had paid
careful attention to the evidence. ``I think that the evidence
didn't add up to the commission of a crime.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a Texas businessman who traveled to Connecticut with
Gritz in September 1996, was accused of planning to use a private
plane to fly Gritz and the boys out of the state. Gritz's son is
facing separate prosecution.

THE NOMINEES FOR HARDEST-WORKING ACTOR ARE ...  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Elizabeth Weitzman is the film critic for Marie Claire magazine.  
 By ELIZABETH WEITZMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some actors, nominated or not, it's the brightest night of
the year: Jim Carrey will hardly be ignored by the fawning cameras
and fans at the Academy Awards. But at home, we see only a small
fraction of Hollywood's acting population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awards season is hell,'' moans Christopher McDonald, one of
the many actors whose outfits won't be breathlessly assessed by
Joan and Melissa Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read the papers and go, `Oh, but what about
(italics)me?(end italics)'''
</P>
<P>
   True, he's not Tom Cruise. But did Tom Cruise appear in 23 films
during the '90s? McDonald did.
</P>
<P>
   Has Denzel Washington been in more than 80 movies? Maury Chaykin
has.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of this year's Academy Award nominees for best
actor, not one has matched the output of Stephen Tobolowsky in the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   If you've turned on a TV set or visited a cineplex in the last
two decades, you know his face, and Chaykin's and McDonald's as
well. They are the worker bees of the movie industry, among the
most prolific actors in Hollywood, according to a recent list
published in Variety. So even though they won't be burnishing any
acceptance speeches for Oscar night, it's time they had a moment in
the spotlight. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STEPHEN TOBOLOWSKY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his forthcoming movie, ``Bossa Nova'' (opening in May),
Stephen Tobolowsky plays a bald, gangly, maladroit lawyer who can't
believe anyone would fall in love with him; so he invents a new
identity as an Internet Romeo. In a way, it's the consummate role
for this actor. When he arrived in Hollywood from Texas in 1976,
the town's general response was summed up by the director Bruce
Beresford. ``He said I would never have a film career because I
wasn't photogenic,''
</P>
<P>
   Tobolowsky, 48, recalled in a telephone interview. He was asked
to change his name, and promised multiple gigs as soon as he grew
his hair back. Yet even when reborn as Steve Adams, who slathered
mud treatments on his head twice a week, he got no roles.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he decided to capitalize on what were seen as his
deficiencies. When he tried to seduce Bridget Fonda in ``Single
White Female,'' his too-lanky arms seemed to elongate repulsively,
like some poisonous spider's. The eyes that, by celebrity
standards, are just a little too prominent, hid all kinds of
secrets when he played a dissembling executive in ``The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   And in his best-known performance, as the ultra-annoying
insurance salesman in ``Groundhog Day,'' he put it all together in
a perfect ode to the perennial bumbler. Tobolowsky embraces the
term ``character actor'' and its inherent gifts, which allow him to
pop up repeatedly, like the prize in a box of Cracker Jack. It's
enough for him that people he encounters often think he's
(italics)Their(end italics) insurance agent or, as in a recent
instance, their supermarket bag boy.
</P>
<P>
   If he has a complaint, it's about Hollywood's persistent lack of
imagination. The industry's reward for his memorable turn in
``Groundhog Day'' is to make (italics)him(end italics) relive the
same experience over and over: ``After that, people said, `Oh, this
guy does wacky comedy!' Now they alwayswant to make me a
goofball.'' When the studios do offer up some variety, it's usually
a request for ``the tough cop, the suspicious official or
somebody's dad or principal.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobolowsky does his best to find quirkier parts in independent
films. He'll play a sleazy telemarketer in ``Prime Gig,'' an
Orthodox Jew in ``Stanley's Gig'' _ ``I've done so many movies, the
names start to repeat themselves,'' he says _ and a bookie in ``The
Operator.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he notes that actors like Jim Carrey can't experiment as
freely with different genres, and that he would hate to have to
duck out back doors like Al Pacino, he prefers not to measure
himself against higher-profile colleagues. Instead, he draws a
parallel to the former Boston Celtics player John Havlicek: ``He
always started the game on the bench. If they wanted him to take a
few shots, he would. If they wanted him to play most of the game,
he could. Well, if they need someone who can pass the ball off or
rebound, I'm happy to do it. And if they need someone to score
points, I can do that, too.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAURY CHAYKIN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With undisguised delight, Maury Chaykin says, ``There's an
extraordinary billboard up on Sunset Boulevard right now, with a
humongous photograph of my face.'' The ad is for ``The Golden
Spiders,'' the cable movie in which Chaykin plays the detective
Nero Wolfe, and it has given the actor a new pastime. ``I drive by
it constantly, back and forth, back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare show of vanity for an actor who specializes in
particularly unsavory characters.
</P>
<P>
   American audiences know Chaykin best for his startling cameos,
small but potent appearances in films generally populated by
extremely well-groomed stars. His breakout role was in ``Dances
With Wolves'': while Kevin Costner rode the prairies with head held
high, Chaykin melted in his own sweat as a jittery, suicidal
cavalry major. More recently, he clouded the high gloss of
``Entrapment'' with his performance as a dissipated underworld
figure with a comically monstrous pot belly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But if you really want to see what Chaykin, 50, can do, you had
best look north. After failing to find paying work in his native
New York, despite ``30 or 40 Off Off Broadway plays,'' he was
offered a job at an underground theater in Toronto. That was in the
mid-'70s, and he has lived there on and off ever since. In Canada,
Chaykin found audiences and directors _ including Atom Egoyan _ who
were willing to celebrate his lack of physical perfection, or
better still, ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   He received critical acclaim for a 1985 movie called ``Canada's
Sweetheart: The Saga of Hal C. Banks,'' and built a popular
following in projects like ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' in which he
gave an unexpectedly disturbing performance as a choleric,
cuckolded husband. The ultimate proof that Canadians now consider
Chaykin one of their own may be the Genie award _ Canada's
equivalent of the Oscar _ he captured in 1994 for his portrayal of
a deeply troubled Brian Wilson-like musician in the film ``Whale
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaykin isn't shy about reproaching Hollywood for its insistence
on eye appeal: ``It's just brutal. You (italics)have(end italics)
to look great. It has nothing to do with the way most people are,
the way most people are built. It's sick.'' The actor certainly
doesn't shun American film, and the truth is that American film
doesn't shun him, either. His projects include a Wesley Snipes
action picture, ``The Art of War,'' and a recent Sundance entry,
``What's Cooking?,'' in which he plays Kyra Sedgwick's aging
father. But he harbors no illusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't expect people to say, `Let's star Maury Chaykin in,
you know, the next Disney movie.' It's easier for me to make that
happen in Canada. I've played so many leading roles there. They
were not huge, box office-commercial films. But they were lovely,
beautiful films.'' And if those chances were ever to come his way
as often in the United States, Chaykin says, it would ``just be
gravy.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTOPHER McDONALD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do you do when you're one of the innumerable handsome men
in Hollywood, and you can't get anyone to notice you? You probably
start off in forgettable films like ``Grease 2'' or ``Where the
Boys Are '84.'' And if you're in the majority, you quickly fade
from view, as the next batch of comely hopefuls takes your place.
But Christopher McDonald, 44, found a different route.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a certain good look, they really can't use you
unless you're the lead guy, because you're almost like
competition,'' he observes. So McDonald has subtly subverted his
features, turning, for example, a naturally genial smile into an
ominous smirk. In fact, most of his characters seem resentful of
their good looks, as though they had been given a promise never
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   As Darryl, Geena Davis's patronizing husband in ``Thelma and
Louise,'' McDonald captured a bent male ego desperately struggling
for control, playing him as a star quarterback long gone to seed.
And for ``Quiz Show,'' he examined the flip side of fragile
masculinity, as an ultra-smooth talk show host carefully masking
any emotion for fear of cracking the facade.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he will take on the bad-guy mantle again, as an evil
university provost in ``The Skulls''; later this year, in ``Requiem
for a Dream,'' he will portray a self-help guru partially based on
the undeniably slick Tony Robbins. ``My most memorable parts have
been when I wasn't afraid to say yes to playing the fall guy, the
cad, the alpha-villain,'' McDonald says, while admitting to some
frustration over typecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Thelma and Louise,' I got offered every
hayseed-chewing, pickup-driving, wife-beating rat out there. Until
I had to say, `Are they serious?' I (italics)can(end italics) do
other things.'' But he adds: ``You'd rather take those parts than
not work. Being anonymous in this business is probably the worst
thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald is hoping that the typecasting is over now that he's a
regular on the new CBS drama ``Family Law.'' He plays a roguish
lawyer, and he has already begun to expand the part considerably.
Consequently, he is starting to see a difference in the way he is
viewed by audiences. ``It used to be: `Oh, man, you're that guy! In
that movie!' But now they say, `Hey, Christopher McDonald, my mom
loves your show!'''
</P>
<P>
   The next step, he hopes, will be a change in the industry's
opinion. He notes that one of the reasons he took the job was its
``potential to push me into leading man material.'' Imagining the
possibilities, he says, ``I've been one away from something huge
for the longest time.''

 (af)  
 By EDWARD ZWICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ You direct a movie. Or produce one. It's
taken you two to three years _ maybe even six or seven _ to get it
made. If it does well, you're thrilled. If the critics like it,
you're delighted. If both happen, you're terrified.
</P>
<P>
   Because now you start thinking about awards.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after Halloween, stories speculating on the contenders
begin to run nationally in what has become an endless stream of
entertainment news. In Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, the
daily trade papers that everyone claims not to read but that
everyone subscribes to, ``For Your Consideration'' ads appear.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them feature your picture. For a producer, writer or
director, this is secretly quite appealing. Suddenly you, not
Harrison Ford, are the star of your movie. Your sister from Chicago
calls, asking if she can meet Matt Damon at the after-parties. You
tell her to dream on. Someone in line at the supermarket tells you
your chances are pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Then your wife announces that awards are meaningless, that it is
all about the work, that the honor is in the doing ... and that she
has nothing to wear. Despite your every attempt to remain both
modest and unjinxed, you can't help but begin to speculate on the
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, your movie has been finished for months and you've
got time on your hands. If you're lucky, you've begun work on your
next. But more likely you are floundering in the nether world of
development, meeting with studios or actors, reading bad scripts or
writing worse ones. It's been a while since anyone has told you how
much they loved your movie. And so when the studio vice president
calls to say that the Golden Globe nominations are to be announced
the next day at dawn and do you want to be called at home, you say,
``I'll probably be up anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   And you are. It's 5:30 and you've been awake since 4. You listen
to the other categories without paying much attention. When at last
you hear your name, it goes by so fast you question whether it
happened at all. You go online and read the list again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   Now what? It's 6 in the morning and there's no one to call. You
hug your dog. You pace a bit. You wake your wife. You wake your
kids. Finally, you can't wait any longer and you call your parents,
who inevitably ask, ``What, exactly, are the Golden Globes?''
</P>
<P>
   In the office the phone is ringing. It's your agent. He always
knew you had it in you. Your lawyer is holding on another line.
Then your accountant checks in. And then pretty much everyone you
have ever met, including someone from summer camp in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of champagne arrives, from a producer who never returns
your calls. Baskets of muffins, flowers and fruit soon follow. By
the time the fifth basket is delivered, you are too busy reading
about yourself in The New York Times to pay much attention. You
say, ``Just put it on the desk,'' as you read your name again.
</P>
<P>
   The phone keeps ringing. Fancy people invite you to dinner
parties. There's even an offer or two. It's all come true, the
fulfillment of childhood evenings long ago _ you and your sisters
all in pajamas, eating popcorn and watching awards shows on
television. Already you can hear the words, ``And the nominees
are...'' It's a thrill that lasts at least as long as it takes for
the next thought to form in your head:
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Your stomach drops. You thought you were past the fear and
self-doubt. Instead, you find yourself facing the funhouse mirror
in which Hollywood conspires to make everyone, particularly those
who work in it, feel less than they are _ less beautiful, less
successful and less talented. Because the moment the envelope is
opened, you will cease being a nominee. And the chances are four in
five you will become a loser.
</P>
<P>
   So the weeks that follow, which should be the most fun of your
life, also become something of a nightmare. By New Year's Day,
every magazine, radio and television critic comes out with a Top 10
list, as does the National Board of Review (a venerable
organization that everyone has heard of, though no one knows why).
You are included on several. You are left off others.
</P>
<P>
   Your high school drama teacher calls with his analysis. So does
your cousin in Seattle who's ``in the business'' by virtue of
running a video store. You turn on CNN to check out the situation
in Chechnya and discover, instead, a half-hour special devoted to
handicapping the awards.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine editors, talk-show hosts, television critics,
everybody's an expert. Film by film, they deconstruct the
competition. Two of the films are comedies and comedies never win.
One of the films is too radical for the more traditional tastes of
the voters. Or too sexual. Or too violent. Against your will you
find yourself sussing out the competition. This guy will win
because he's old and almost dead and has never won before.
</P>
<P>
   No. It'll be the woman because women never win in this category
_ even though this particular woman has no particular talent. No.
That young first-time director will win because he's hip and cute _
as you used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of wooing voters, the studio employs an ``awards
consultant.'' It all boils down to how much to spend on the
campaign. In last year's race between ``Saving Private Ryan'' and
``Shakespeare in Love,'' Dreamworks and Miramax are said to have
spent more than $10 million, which is outrageous and indecent,
except when it's your movie.
</P>
<P>
   You win a Golden Globe: more phone calls, more champagne, more
muffins. But rather than congratulating you, people seem mainly
interested in your chances for an Oscar nomination. You attend one
of those fancy dinner parties, where you are seated next to Sidney
Poitier. He treats you like an old friend. Midway through dinner he
announces that yours is the best movie of the year. You've gone
from Golden Globe nominee to Oscar front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oscars are still a long way off and the orgy of
self-congratulation is just beginning. You dust off the script
you've been writing and try to get back to work, but your mind
drifts and you begin counting just how many academy members you
know personally. Pretty soon you just have to admit you've bought
in. You're on the awards spike. And the better the high, the worse
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The more excited you allow yourself to be about the possibility
of winning, the tougher it will be when they call someone else's
name. You realize your kids are beginning to hide the arts section
of the paper in the morning. For years you've marveled at Woody
Allen's refusal to participate in the awards ritual. Only now it
begins to dawn on you that it may not be moral courage or Olympian
disdain that keeps him away: he's probably too anxious.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And then you are nominated for an Oscar. Champagne, muffins,
etc. The accepted wisdom is that it's a privilege just to be
nominated. Indeed, you can't believe your name could ever be
mentioned in the same breath as the other nominees in your
category. But anyone who says it's a privilege to have your work
placed in a competition with an 80 percent chance of losing has
never lost anything. Not a spelling bee. Or a high school playoff
game. Or a girlfriend. You remember your baseball coach's words,
``Show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   In some essential way, we are all losers in Hollywood. It's hard
to think of any other bond that distinguishes us as a community. In
each of us there is something unfulfilled, some ache or deficiency
of character that leads us to fill a hole in the heart with the
love of strangers. Like the Scarecrow in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' we
imagine that what is broken in us can somehow be fixed by a ... by
a ... by a ... by an award.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony nears. Should you write a speech? Should you buy a
tuxedo? You decide to buy the tuxedo first and write the speech
later. You spend hours trying on tuxes and each one makes you look
like the headwaiter in a '30s movie. By the fifth tux it occurs to
you that you have done absolutely no work in the past week. And
when, on the day of the awards, you finally put on the cuff links
and the cummerbund and the bow tie, you find you look exactly like
everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, you decide to write a speech. You realize
this may be bad luck. On the other hand you remember just how many
good films have been done in by appalling speeches. And so you get
to work. Your speech must be gracious, generous, humble, funny,
insightful, emotional and brief. You decide to put off writing a
speech.
</P>
<P>
   A white limo arrives outside your house at 3:30 in the afternoon
on the day of the awards. Neighbors peer out their windows as you
emerge, tuxedoed and blinking in the glare. Your son insists on
taking your picture and you are reminded of prom night. In the limo
are jars of jelly beans, which you begin eating by the handful.
</P>
<P>
   As you try to work on the speech you have put off writing, you
remember that, once upon a time, you were contemptuous of awards.
You've always believed that institutions have never been reliable
judges of art. In college you learned about the Salon des Refuses,
in which Impressionists like Manet and Pissarro were forced to show
their work independently after having been turned down by the
official exposition of the French Academy.
</P>
<P>
   As you take your seat in the auditorium, your wife takes your
hand. It is cold and clammy. She says something nice and calming.
But her tone reminds you of how you felt, one afternoon, while
awaiting the results of a CAT scan (``... the envelope please'').
You check the program to see how many awards precede yours: it's
hours away and except for the jelly beans, you've had nothing to
eat all day to compete with the two glasses of champagne now
roiling inside.
</P>
<P>
   As Billy Crystal tells a joke, your mind wanders. You ask
yourself why we, as a culture, have become so fixated on awards. Is
it America's insatiable fascination with winning? Is it just cheap
programming? Is it the sophisticated publicity machinery of a
multi-billion-dollar industry? Or is it a shrewd attempt to confer
upon the movies a legitimacy that may not be warranted by their
artistic ambitions? Have we, as a culture, become so accustomed to
being sold at, that we need this kind of public apotheosis to
determine a work's merit?
</P>
<P>
   What is ``Oscar-worthy,'' after all, but a sophisticated
marketing tool? Recently, you've begun to notice how, every time
the word ``Oscar'' is used in print, it must be followed by the
symbol signifying its trademark. What, exactly, are we all selling
here tonight?
</P>
<P>
   You realize that for the last two minutes you have forgotten to
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Hours (and several trips to the bathroom) later, your category
is announced. The celebrity presenter says a few words about what
this award means, but you have stopped listening. You close your
eyes, trying to remember the joy you felt in first imagining the
film you would make, the exaltation and the compromise in the
process of making it, and the giddiness when the audience
responded.
</P>
<P>
   What you're most afraid of, you suddenly realize, is that this
might be the best work you will ever do and that you may never be
here again. As the list of nominees is read, a cameraman kneels in
the aisle and zooms in on your face. You imagine the close-up seen
by a billion people _ the rictus of a ridiculous and foreign smile
that has somehow immobilized your face.
</P>
<P>
   As the envelope is opened, the faces of your children suddenly
swim into your thoughts, all shiny and bright. You realize that
they are staying up very late to watch and that it is a school
night. Tomorrow, in fact, is your day to drive car pool.
</P>
<P>
   You hope it won't be a long night.

THE ONGOING AMERICANIZATION OF MICHAEL CAINE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Michael Caine's cockney accent has become so much a
part of his public persona that it always comes as something of a
surprise to find him in a movie using a different one. And yet
actors are always ``doing'' accents, and Caine has done his share.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his most recent movie, ``The Cider House Rules,''
this Londoner sounds _ and looks _ convincing enough as a New
England orphanage director to have won an Academy Award nomination
for best supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is something about the English that turns accents into
social, even political, statements. Thus, when Caine entered the
theater in the late 1950s, he could have easily disguised his
working-class background by adopting a more rounded stage voice.
Instead, he held onto his cockney vowels as a way of rebelling
against a class system from which, in the end, he could not escape.
He earned his first Oscar nomination for playing a cockney lecher
in the 1966 movie ``Alfie,'' but in England he was labeled as a
cockney actor.
</P>
<P>
   All of which explains why he so enjoys working in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left to work in America for the first time 30 years
ago, no one talked about my accent or my class or anything,'' he
recalled over lunch near his Chelsea home. ``It was, `Can he act?'
No? Then fling him out.' It was really liberating for me. In
England, I was a cockney actor. In America, I was an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that he went on to make dozens of films in the United
States, some memorable, many less so, and to become a familiar face
on late-night talk shows. With the British movie industry
stagnating in the late 1970s he even moved to Los Angeles, where he
lived for eight years until homesickness got the better of him. But
he remains one of only a handful of European actors who clearly
feel at home in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when he was asked to play the role of Dr. Wilbur Larch in
``The Cider House Rules,'' Lasse Hallstrom's movie version of John
Irving's best-selling novel, Caine's main concern was to get the
accent right. And he worked with a dialogue coach for two weeks
before he was persuaded he could do it. What reassured him was
that, for Hallstrom, Irving and the movie's producer, Richard N.
Goldstein, his accent was not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the accent,'' he said. ``What they wanted was a
performance as good as any American actor could have done. And to
play an American doctor in 1943 was about as far away from me as I
had ever gone, so it was very interesting to do. A lot of other
actors could have played it better, but I could not have played it
any better, which gives me a tremendous sense of satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   With the nominations for this year's Academy Awards, there came
more satisfaction: not only was ``The Cider House Rules'' nominated
in seven categories, including best film, best director and best
adapted screenplay (by Irving), but Caine _ who turns 67 on Tuesday
_ also won his fifth Oscar nomination in a long career that
embraces more than 80 films. Nominated for best actor for
``Alfie,'' ``Sleuth'' and ``Educating Rita,'' his only Oscar to
date was in 1987 for best supporting actor in Woody Allen's
``Hannah and Her Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Cider House Rules,'' Caine has a role that any older
actor would covet. Larch, the kindly white-haired obstetrician who
runs an orphanage in rural Maine, is also an ether addict and an
abortionist. But when pregnant women turn to him for abortions, he
tries to persuade them to give birth and leave their babies in his
children's home.
</P>
<P>
   As he slows down with age, he is grooming a successor in a young
man, Homer Wells, who was born in the orphanage and whom he raised
almost like a son. And his heart is broken when Homer, played by
Tobey Maguire (``Wonder Boys,'' ``Pleasantville''), decides to
leave for a taste of adventure in the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Caine said he felt comfortable in the role, not only because he
enjoyed the company of children (``I have this conceit that I am
the best father in the world,'' he said of raising his two
daughters, both now grown), but also because he could identify with
abandoned children since he recalled suffering ``mild'' physical
abuse as a child when he was evacuated from wartime London.
Further, he evidently empathizes with Larch's decision to ignore
laws forbidding abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a pro-life person asking me, `Do you agree with
abortion?''' Caine said. ``I said, no one agrees with abortion,
women who have abortions don't agree with abortions, even the
doctors who do them don't like it. But then we have to face
reality. Larch set himself up as an abortionist in order to adopt
children, not in order to do abortions. But if he didn't do
abortions, the women wouldn't come to him. They'd go to some
quack.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, when casting his film, Hallstrom said he was
persuaded he had found his Larch when he saw Caine's last film,
Mark Herman's ``Little Voice,'' in which the actor played a
good-natured boozy talent scout in the north of England, surely an
ocean away from the orphanage director from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ```Little Voice' showed me that he really had the authority and
wit and compassion that the character needed,'' said the
53-year-old Swedish director, whose previous American films include
``What's Eating Gilbert Grape.'' ``I wanted a soft-spoken version
of the novel. And Larch's warmth and compassion in the film is
really Michael's. His compassion for children was even stronger
than I imagined. It came as a bonus when we were shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, until now, Irving's favorite Michael Caine role was
as Peachy Carnehan in ``The Man Who Would Be King,'' John Huston's
1975 adaption of Kipling's novel in which Caine and Sean Connery
play scoundrels in 19th-century India.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved him in that film, and I imagined that he could soften
Larch as he appears on the page,'' the novelist said by telephone
from his home in Vermont. ``I didn't alter a word of dialogue, but
if Michael had delivered the lines the way Larch delivers them in
the novel, he would have been infinitely unsympathetic, a kind of
moral bully, an intellectual tyrant over this unformed boy who is
Homer. But he didn't. He seemed less didactic, less polemical; his
delivery softened the lines. He seemed more vulnerable to the
ether, more tired, more withdrawn than the character who goes on
railing for 596 pages of the novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, what has often been described as Caine's deadpan
expression served him well in his understated portrayal of Larch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated by the minimalism of movie acting, by how
little you can do,'' Caine said. ``People will say, `How come I
know what he's thinking?' Sometimes in a movie if you just look,
people put their own connotation on it, because in real life people
don't make faces. It's a tremendous power to be able to do so
little with tremendous effect, if you know what you're doing. And
after 36 years I probably know what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   After 36 years, though, Caine is also starting afresh. In the
early 1990s, he gave up acting in films, fed up with the roles he
was being offered, fed up with getting up early. Instead, he sat
down and wrote a best-selling autobiography, ``What's It All
About?'' (the title echoes the hit song from ``Alfie''), and
enjoyed himself as a major shareholder in seven London restaurants.
But then the itch to act returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get old,'' he explained. ``People have to accept you
as an older man. You can't hang on to Glamour. I was always the
leading man, but when you get to 60, you can't play the lover. Look
at the trouble Sean Connery got into for `Entrapment' with
Catherine Zeta-Jones. So I thought, if I'm not going to get the
girl in the movie, I want the part.''
</P>
<P>
   His first role after resuming his career was in Bob Rafelson's
``Blood and Wine'' (1997), in which he played Jack Nicholson's
partner in crime. Next came ``Little Voice,'' for which he won a
Golden Globe as best actor in a musical comedy.
</P>
<P>
   After ``The Cider House Rules,'' Caine acted alongside Geoffrey
Rush, Kate Winslet and Joaquin Phoenix in ``Quills,'' Philip
Kaufman's still-to-be-released movie about the Marquis de Sade (
Caine plays an envoy sent by Napoleon to destroy de Sade). And
currently Caine is working in London on ``Shiner,'' a film directed
by John Irvin (``A Month by the Lake'') in which he plays an East
End gang leader.
</P>
<P>
   So, back in England, he is once again playing the cockney? Yes,
but there is a twist: he can no longer pass as a cockney.
</P>
<P>
   ``From living in America, my voice changed,'' he said. ``What I
did with a cockney accent was cut down the speed, because it's not
the accent Americans don't understand, it's the speed. People think
my accent is cockney, but it isn't. It's mine, which is now
impersonated by everyone. It's an amalgam. So in `Shiner,' which is
a real cockney role, I have to put on the accent.''
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed, though, is the pleasure he gets from
flaunting his own distinct accent at his fellow English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the original bourgeois nightmare,'' he said with
undisguised glee. ``A cockney with intelligence and a million
dollars.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ After so many games that went wrong, the Houston
Cougars finally got it right.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Running their offense at the end with the patience missing so
often in an 11-game losing streak, the 12th-seeded Cougars upset
No. 5 seed Marquette 77-75 at the Pyramid on Wednesday in the first
round of the Conference USA basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the first time since the 1995 Southwest Conference
event, the Cougars get to stick around past the opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd suffered so much (in the losing streak) because we didn't
score enough in the last three minutes of games and didn't keep our
patience,'' coach Clyde Drexler said. ``This one was a long time
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   UH's most recent victory had been at the Pyramid, where UH
defeated Memphis 98-89 on Jan. 22. The Cougars could be excused if
they felt they had been waiting since the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't felt this good in a long time,'' said junior Chad
Hendrick (17 points, 7-of-12 shooting), who with seniors Kenny
Younger and Gee Gervin accounted for 52 of the Cougars' 77 points.
``We've been so battle-tested, we weren't going to let this one
slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger (21 points, 7-for-10 shooting, eight rebounds, two
blocked shots) staged one of his better performances after a
late-season slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to go home. We wanted to keep playing,''
Younger said. ``Finally, we got over the hump and put it
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In becoming the first 12th seed to win a C-USA tournament game,
the Cougars (9-21) also took some of the sting out of being the
losingest team in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get to play another game; that's the biggest thing,''
Younger said of today's quarterfinal meeting with Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've split with them the last two years,'' Gervin said.
``This game (with Marquette) has to give us a big confidence
boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervin (14 points, five rebounds, three vital assists down the
stretch), like the other Cougars, felt it was the ability to stay
within the offense that enabled them to hold off the Golden Eagles
(15-13), who were within a point nine times.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the timeouts late in the game, we said, `Don't look at the
clock; just keep playing,' and that's how it happened,'' said
Bernard Smith. Smith played most of the game at point guard so that
Gervin could play off the ball; Smith also spent most of his 34
minutes defending Marquette's Brian Wardle.
</P>
<P>
   John Cliff (22 points), Wardle (20) and Cordell Henry (16)
scored all but 17 of Marquette's points from the perimeter, with
Cliff and Henry a combined 8-of-13 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Said Smith, ``I'd bet that's 20 of the toughest points Wardle
has scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Drexler, ``Whenever we thought we had a comfortable lead,
they hit some incredible shots. We didn't give anything to them.''
</P>
<P>
   UH shot 57 percent in the second half after a 43-percent first
half and needed every bit, since Marquette hit 54 percent in each
half. Younger and freshman George Williams accounted for five
baskets after offensive rebounds, another crucial factor.
</P>
<P>
   Marquette coach Tom Crean said, ``Our post defense was not our
best effort. They made us pay when we did not get back. Younger and
Williams are two future pros, and you have to pay attention to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Late three-point plays by Gervin and Younger (on Gervin's
assist) gave UH a 66-59 lead with 3:38 to go. Cliff scored from out
front, then hit a trey, and the Golden Eagles were within 68-64
with 2:56 remaining _ and the Cougars seemed poised on their
familiar high wire.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gervin, with the shot clock showing three seconds, found
Hendrick in the right corner for Hendrick's third 3-pointer. After
a Wardle basket made it 71-66,
</P>
<P>
   ``I reacted to the defense, and when they collapsed on me, I got
it to Chad when he was wide-open,'' Gervin said of the late-game
patience that had been missing.

NOEL ANNAN, 83, VERSATILE ENGLISHMAN, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England)  (js) 
 By BRUCE WEBER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Noel Annan, an educator, historian and critic whose wide-ranging
scholarly pursuits, military experience during World War II and
powerful posts in universities and cultural institutions made him
an influential member of the British intelligentsia for more than
half a century, died on Feb. 21 in London. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong insider in the intellectual establishment, Lord Annan
(he was given a life peerage by Prime Minister Harold Wilson in
1965) was the author of several books. They included a biography of
Leslie Stephen, the literary critic and editor of the Dictionary of
Literary Biography, who was Virginia Woolf's father, a work written
in 1950 and revised in 1984. He also wrote ``Changing Enemies: the
Defeat and Regeneration of Germany'' (1994), a memoir of his time
as an intelligence officer during World War II and, for a year
afterward, his role in establishing a new government in postwar
Germany under Konrad Adenauer.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was, as well, a critic with varied interests and a regular
contributor to The New York Review of Books, where he published
more than 100 essays on subjects from George Eliot to the Falklands
War.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a shrewd realist, but he did believe there was such a
thing as the public good and in the possibility of the better
world,'' said Robert Silvers, the editor of The New York Review of
Books. ``And we thought he was a marvelous writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as an independent and usually progressive thinker on
social and cultural issues, Annan was a famous needler of
conservative social policy. In 1970 he led a successful protest to
keep the government of Edward Heath from allowing public museums to
begin charging admissions. And yet he was not above giving credit
where he found it due, praising Margaret Thatcher for the spine of
her leadership, if not all of her policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was certainly no Thatcherite,'' said Donald Lamm, his
editor at W.W. Norton, publisher of ``Changing Enemies.'' ``But he
liked people with high brain wattage, and there were people
associated with Thatcher who had that.''
</P>
<P>
   His 1990 book, ``Our Age: English Intellectuals Between the
World Wars _ A Group Portrait,'' generally perceived as his most
ambitious work, was a reflection on the class he belonged to, its
grand promise, frequent greatness and ultimate failure to save
Britain from the follies of its political leaders. Often anecdotal
or aphoristically self-deprecating _ ``Every generation finds their
own wit suddenly out of fashion and replaced by a society that
seems coarser'' _ the book had a mixed reception. Its harsher
critics found its disparagement of politicians too thorough. But as
Denis Donoghue wrote in The New York Times Book Review, the book
had a generous spirit that was characteristic of the man even when
it ill served the writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annan does not remain lugubrious for long,'' Donoghue wrote.
``Vivacity keeps breaking in, urged on by good will and an opulent
writing style. A man of the Enlightenment, a Liberal, a pluralist,
he simply can't understand why his political masters so insistently
make asses of themselves. But he avoids making moral judgments by
treating every deplorable act as a symptom of error or madness.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, Annan served on many government commissions
(including, in the 1970s, leading an inquiry into the future of
British television) and on the boards of prominent cultural
institutions, among them the British Museum. He was a director of
the Royal Opera House and from 1980 to 1984 was the board chairman
of the National Portrait Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   With all that, Annan's primary career was as an academician. In
1956, at the age of 39, he became provost of King's College at
Cambridge University, where he himself had been a student, and he
went on to serve as provost at the University College, London and
vice chancellor of the University of London. He was known as a
charismatic leader, popular among students, and as an advocate of
broadening curriculums, improving pedagogy and increasing student
influence and liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as pure an example of the public intellectual as I could
summon up,'' Lamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Gilroy Annan was born on Christmas 1916. His father, James
Gilroy Annan, was a businessman with connections to U.S. railroad
building; his mother, Fannie Quinn, was American, a New Yorker. He
was educated in the British public school system, and his
experience at one of those schools, Stowe, was a lifelong influence
on his educational philosophy. The headmaster, J.F. Roxburgh,
emphasized artistic and literary development, a loosening of the
constraints of hidebound academic tradition and respect for
individual liberty, qualities that were admiringly recollected in
Annan's 1964 book, ``Roxburgh of Stowe.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prologue to ``Changing Enemies,'' Annan wrote about the
serendipitous meeting that set his life on its eventual course. It
was 1939 and he was having lunch at a private club with his father,
who introduced him to another member, who set up his interview with
the British intelligence service. The officer who interviewed him
confused him with his father and presumed, mistakenly, he was an
expert on railroads. And thus he was assigned to operational
intelligence, monitoring the rail movements of German forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chance meeting, a quirk of fate, altered the direction of my
life,'' he wrote. ``Fortune plays a part in most lives, and it
certainly did in mine. When I look back on those days I think of
that sentence in Tyndall's translation of the Bible: `The Lord was
with Joseph and he was a lucky fellow.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Gabriele Ullstein, and
two daughters.

EDITORIAL: ENDING A JUDICIAL BLOCKADE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for its editions of
Thursday, March 9:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to hold confirmation votes Thursday that
would finally end the egregious stalling by Republicans that has
blocked consideration of two worthy nominees for the 9th Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals, on the West Coast. Richard Paez, a respected
federal district judge in Los Angeles, has been waiting four years
for the full Senate to act on his nomination. Marsha Berzon, a
prominent appellate litigator in San Francisco, has been waiting
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Both these candidates were approved by the Senate Judiciary
Committee with the support of its chairman, Orrin Hatch. But a
floor vote was stalled by a few Republicans who reflexively branded
the nominees as too liberal and too ``activist.'' Only after
Democratic complaints about the Republicans' slowness in approving
minority and female nominees did the majority leader, Trent Lott,
agree to allow the full Senate to vote on their nominations.  &QC;  The
Senate should approve the Paez and Berzon nominations, then
promptly vote on the 35 other pending judicial nominations. At the
current sluggish pace, the Senate stands to approve even fewer
judges this year than the 34 it confirmed last year, an
indefensible record at a time when federal courts are facing rising
caseloads and huge backlogs.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this is a presidential election year is no excuse
for inaction. In 1992, President Bush's last year in office, the
Senate, then Democratic, confirmed 66 judges. In the last year of
the Reagan administration, 42 judges were approved. The quality of
justice suffers when the Senate misconstrues its constitutional
role of advise and consent as a license to wage ideological warfare
and procrastinate in hopes that a new president might submit other
nominees.

BILL DANIELS, 79, INNOVATOR IN CABLE TELEVISION INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo.)  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Daniels, a pioneer of the cable television industry, died
Tuesday at a hospital in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was respiratory failure, said Dan Russo, a
spokesman with Daniels &AMP; Associates in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who lived the last few years in Del Mar, Calif., built
what he called a CATV, or community antenna television, system in
Casper, Wyo., and Rawlings, Wyo., in 1952. It served communities
otherwise unable to receive television because the broadcast
stations were too far away or their signals were blocked by
mountain ranges.
</P>
<P>
   While the Wyoming venture was not the first cable system in the
nation, it was the first to relay a broadcast signal using
microwave technology.
</P>
<P>
   He then developed several other cable systems, and in 1958 he
founded Daniels &AMP; Associates, a cable television brokerage firm and
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels not only served rural residents with cable broadcasts
but also provided programming that was exclusive to cable networks,
so that they could compete in areas already served by broadcast
television.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually owned hundreds of cable systems throughout the
nation but sold them or merged them with United Artists
Communications in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Daniels started Prime Ticket Network with the owner of
the Los Angeles Lakers, Jerry Buss; he sold the network in 1994 to
Tele-Communications Inc. The network later became part of Fox
Sports.
</P>
<P>
   He also owned a basketball team in Salt Lake City; held a
part-interest in the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team; founded
the U.S. Football League, which is now defunct; and managed the
career of the heavyweight boxer Ron Lyle. He sponsored a car at the
Indianapolis 500 and in 1996 set a world speed record for business
jets; his four-man crew piloted a Learjet around the globe, making
nine refueling stops, at an average ground speed of 463.5 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Daniels ran unsuccessfully for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He was chosen in 1991 by Broadcasting magazine as one of the
first 60 inductees into the Broadcasting Hall of Fame, and in 1992
he was given a special Emmy Award from the National Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   His philanthropy included a $22 million gift to the University
of Denver; the college of business there is named after him. In
January, he pledged most of his $1.1 billion estate to send
thousands of underprivileged students to college. He donated his $7
million mansion, called Cableland, to the City of Denver to use as
a mayoral residence.
</P>
<P>
   Born on July 1, 1920, in Greeley, Colo., Daniels was graduated
from the New Mexico Military Institute. He served in the Navy as a
fighter pilot during World War II and the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a brother, Jack Daniels of Albuquerque, N.M.

SUITS THREATENED OVER ARSENIC LEVELS IN NEW JERSEY WATER
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.C.)  (af) 
By ANDREW JACOBS  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As many as 700,000 New Jersey residents are drinking water that
is contaminated with dangerously high levels of arsenic, according
to a coalition of environmentalists that is trying to force the
state to tighten acceptable levels of the substance, a known
carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a recent study documenting the perils of prolonged
arsenic consumption, the New Jersey Environmental Federation said
Wednesday that it would sue the state Department of Environmental
Protection for ignoring laws meant to reduce New Jersey's cancer
rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of arsenic that New Jersey residents are being
exposed to is ridiculous,'' said David Pringle, the group's
campaign director. ``Not only is it not acceptable, but it's
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although arsenic is a byproduct of industry and agriculture, in
New Jersey it is more often a naturally occurring element drawn
from the earth's crust. Pringle said that development in the state
had overtaxed underground aquifers and brought more arsenic to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term exposure to arsenic has been shown to cause skin,
bladder and lung cancer and it may cause kidney and liver cancer.
Researchers also believe it harms the nervous system, blood vessels
and the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, drinking-water contamination is acceptable as
long as the risk of cancer from the contaminant does not exceed one
in a million. By the standards now used by the state, however,
residents who drink tap water have a one-in-100 chance of getting
cancer from arsenic contamination, according to the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that those estimates were overblown, and
that it would be technologically unfeasible to meet the goals in
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that hundreds of thousands of people are being poisoned
by arsenic is a hysterical statement,'' said Peter Page, a
spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection.
``It's taken completely out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   What no one disputes is that the nation's standard for arsenic
exposure is woefully obsolete: it was established in 1942, when
arsenic's degree of toxicity was not known. Even the water industry
agrees that the current standard, 50 parts per billion, is far too
high.
</P>
<P>
   But an agreement to revise the figure has been mired in politics
since 1974, when Congress first asked environmental officials for a
new standard. While many clean water advocates are seeking a
standard of three parts per billion, lobbyists for water suppliers,
developers and manufacturers have been seeking a less stringent
standard.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to come up with new regulations, Congress
commissioned the National Academy of Sciences to determine the
effects of arsenic on humans. Last year, the findings were
released, documenting a wide range of health problems related to
moderate arsenic exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone doubts that the current standard is way
too high and that it increases the risk of cancer,'' said Dr.
Robert Goyer, a pathologist from North Carolina who led the panel's
committee on toxicology.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Environmental Protection Agency used those findings
to establish a new range of standards, the recommendations have
languished at the Office of Management and Budget for months. Last
week, the Natural Resources Defense Council said it would file a
lawsuit against the agency if the new regulations were not issued
within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Using research it obtained from the EPA, the group estimated
that at least 34 million Americans drink tap water that contains
unacceptable levels of arsenic. The New Jersey Environmental
Federation used the same data for their calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Fox, the agency's assistant administrator for water, said
the new regulations would be issued by June. He said that he could
not predict the final outcome, but that the standard would be far
more stringent than 50 parts per billion. ``We know we need to be
much more protective of the public's health,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Resources Defense Council and the New Jersey
Environmental Federation are both pushing for a standard of three
parts per billion or less, which would, statistically, reduce the
risk of getting cancer from arsenic in drinking water to one in
1,700 in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Pringle acknowledged that it was unrealistic to expect to reduce
</P>
<P>
   the risk of cancer to one in a million, in compliance with the
state regulations. To get to that level of safety, he said, arsenic
would have to be kept below one-half part per billion, and most
widely available testing methods cannot detect arsenic at that
level.
</P>
<P>
   He said that bringing the state's water to a level of three
parts per billion, through filtration, would cost the average
household $5 to $15 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Water industry executives said a goal of 3 parts per billion
would be far too expensive to achieve, and they would like to see
the regulations set between 5 and 10 parts per billion. Edward
Mullen, vice president of the Elizabethtown Water Co., which serves
one million people in northern New Jersey, said he worried that
politics might influence the final outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public deserves a number they can have confidence is based
on science, not misrepresentation,'' he said. ``You best believe
the water suppliers will be looking very carefully at those
numbers.''

EDDIE `THE EAGLE' RUFFLES SOME FEATHERS WITH JAIL VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could have knocked the Stars over with a feather _ an
Eagle's feather.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's not as if they didn't know that Eddie ``The Eagle''
Belfour was a charter member of the cuckoo's nest, but still,
you're never quite ready for that 5 a.m. wakeup call from the Lew
Sterrett Justice Center.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Domino's was closed.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a very mortified Eddie on the phone, trying to
explain to Ken Hitchcock, or Bob Gainey, or whoever he finally
reached, about his big night at, of all places, The Mansion, the
upscale Dallas hotel on Turtle Creek.
</P>
<P>
   He had to tell them that ``Eddie the Eagle'' had just become
``Eddie the Jailbird.''
</P>
<P>
   I have a nasty feeling that that's when the feathers really
flew.
</P>
<P>
   You know most of the gritty details by now, how Belfour, having
probably the best season of his career, went to The Mansion for
dinner. At some point female companionship was involved. A room was
taken. Too many drinks were imbibed. Not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   Things went downhill from there. The unidentified woman told
hotel security that Belfour was scaring her and that she wanted to
leave. Those of us who have stared into those pale blue eyes during
locker room interviews can relate.
</P>
<P>
   She was escorted from the hotel, which apparently disappointed
Belfour greatly. Now who would share those tasty pillow mints with
him? He, too, decided to make his exit.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel personnel, already having called the local constabulary _
the cops _ attempted to detain Belfour, who reacted as if he'd
discovered a Holiday Inn Express towel in the bathroom. Police
arrived to find Eddie doing his Hulk Hogan impression on the
bellman. When they politely asked him to cease and desist, Belfour
threw a kick in their direction.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy dose of Mace, however, quickly convinced Eddie that
the evening had reached its zenith. Outfitted in a sparkling new
set of stainless steel bracelets, he was escorted to the
aforementioned Sterrett Center. Not exactly the accommodations, or
companions, Eddie had in mind when the evening began.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was charged with assault and resisting arrest. There was
an unconfirmed report that hotel officials have asked the police
not topursue the assault charge, a Class C misdemeanor. The
resisting arrest charge is a more serious Class A misdemeanor. The
Stars are taking the incident seriously, and they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a situation this serious and this dramatic, it's
dramatic for all the people involved, and while a lot of
responsibility will lie on Ed's shoulders, right now, all our
concerns are for everybody, '' coach Ken Hitchcock said at
yesterday's skate at the Dr Pepper StarsCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Because the incident involved alcohol, the NHL's substance-abuse
team and Players Association are now in the picture. They will
investigate and react accordingly. From a hockey standpoint,
Belfour could face a suspension, a fine or a slap on the wrist. The
legal aspects are a bit more sobering. He could get a year in jail,
a $4,000 fine or both if found guilty on the resisting-arrest
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this was the first time the Stars have had trouble with
Belfour, Gainey answered cryptically, ``This is the problem that is
here today, so this is the one we are working on.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone had whispered a week ago that one of the Stars'
players was going to be involved in this type of incident, chances
are even the most casual fans would have fingered Belfour as one of
the top three suspects. After all, Craig Ludwig has retired.
Everybody knows that Eddie is the Stars' resident wild child. It's
the nature of the game and position that he plays.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, when the Stars decided to give Eddie a few days off
this week _ rookie Manny Fernandez was already ticketed to start
last night's game _ they still tried to keep his structure in
place. Belfour is a man who needs structure. He needs to know where
he has to be and when he has to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a plan in place, a three- or four-day plan, that was
being administered, and Eddie was cooperating on it,'' Hitchcock
said. ``We knew exactly where we were going and the timetable that
was going to take place. Eddie would have been back in here Friday,
getting prepared to play. Unfortunately the timetable changed.''
</P>
<P>
   It changed when Belfour mixed a change in focus from on-ice to
off-ice with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Belfour is unaware of the inherent dangers
therein. Last year, Belfour swore off drinking during a three-month
drive to help the Stars win the Stanley Cup. His dedication paid
off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who predicted that Belfour would not be able to
sustain that high level of play this season, that having finally
won his Cup, he would fall victim to complacency and contentment.
They couldn't have been further off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played three years here with us and he's never been
better, never had a better year, never been more consistent,''
Hitchcock said. ``You ask your goaltender to be competitive every
night, but he's gone beyond that in that he's won us hockey games.
He's gotten us points when maybe we should not have gotten
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has been brilliant, without question, the Stars' MVP
this season. But now he threatens to become a major distraction
just as the Stars are trying to focus on getting players healthy
for another run at the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that our players view as another piece of
adversity that we have to overcome,'' Hitchcock said. ``This goes
above and beyond the game of hockey. It has to be addressed
properly and dramatically. This is serious life stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   When the phone rings at 5 a.m. and ``caller ID'' indicates that
somebody named Lew Sterrett is calling, it usually is. {Jim Reeves
is a columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.} nn

PANEL URGES MORE COLLEGE ASSISTANCE FOR POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York state should sharply expand its financial aid to
college students and continue to concentrate on low-income families
rather than the middle class, a panel of prominent educators and
former government officials appointed by the state Senate to study
financial aid said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, headed by Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, and Clifton R. Wharton Jr., former
chancellor of the State University of New York, said the state
should pay 100 percent of the tuition for the neediest students at
its two public universities _ SUNY and the City University _ rather
than the 90 percent it now pays.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding private colleges, the panel called on the state to
raise the maximum annual grant in its primary financial aid program
_ the Tuition Assistance Program, or TAP _ by more than 20 percent,
to $5,000 from $4,125 for undergraduates and to $1,500 from $550
for graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   In many of its recommendations, the panel seemed to be flouting
the wishes of the state senators who had commissioned them. Last
month, Sen. Kenneth LaValle, chairman of the higher education
committee, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, called
for more help for the middle class _ including making college
tuition tax deductible and allowing families earning up to $80,000
to qualify for TAP grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by the unanimity of the commission that the TAP
program was worth keeping and strengthening and that the emphasis
really ought to be on the underprivileged,'' Volcker said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel leaders expressed hope that their report might have
impact because it came as both the Senate and the Assembly were
discussing ways to expand financial aid to college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they've come up with their own initiatives, I have
more hope that they are going to take some action,'' Volcker said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Wharton met with LaValle, the primary architect behind
the commission, and other senators on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the panel's recommendations, Senate leaders
emphasized the overlap with their own proposals. Both the panel's
recommendations and those of the senators call for raising the
maximum grant for students at private colleges to $5,000 and
creating an agency to set higher education policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we want to make college more
affordable for more families,'' said John McArdle, a spokesman for
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member panel, known as the Commission on New York State
Student Financial Aid, also said state cutbacks in higher education
and TAP grants ``threaten New York state's ability to provide
sufficient and outstanding higher education opportunities to its
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel said that New York's ``economy and society have
benefited hugely'' from TAP. A study for the panel found that more
than 78 percent of TAP recipients in 1989 were still living in New
York seven years later, investing whatever talents they had in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said that while New York spent $700 million _
more than any other state _ on scholarships, the grants had not
kept pace with inflation. Students from families with taxable
income of $50,000 or less are eligible for TAP.
</P>
<P>
   Among its other recommendations, the commission called for the
state to eliminate the policy that reduces TAP awards to students
in their last two years of college and to raise support to private
colleges to at least $75 million, an increase of $27 million.

EDITORIAL: IMF AND WORLD BANK BLUEPRINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for its editions of
Thursday, March 9:
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century after their creation, the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank could use some fresh thinking
about their operations. Thanks to a congressional commission that
unveiled its recommendations about the institutions Wednesday,
there are some bold new ideas to consider. Some of the suggestions
are ill conceived, but others deserve serious consideration by the
United States and other nations that belong to the two
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest and best ideas in the report is a call to
cancel the crushing debt of the world's poorest countries. If the
commission does nothing else but spur the United States and its
allies to get behind this plan, it will have accomplished a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member, bipartisan commission voted unanimously to strip
the IMF of all but one task: extending emergency loans to countries
whose currencies come under attack. The job of fighting poverty
would be turned over to the World Bank. This is a sound idea that
would produce a clearer division of responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The commission would end the current practice of making IMF
bailouts contingent on the acceptance of strict and sometimes
harmful economic policies dictated by the fund after a country
falls into financial crisis. Instead the fund would require
countries to qualify for future loans by opening up their banking
systems and taking other steps that could help prevent a crisis.
This would have the added advantage of allowing the fund to react
more quickly when trouble develops.
</P>
<P>
   These recommendations are constructive, but go too far.
Countries that do not pre-qualify for assistance would be unable to
get loans in a crisis. A less drastic reform would allow the fund
to extend loans to wayward countries, but at a higher interest
rate. The report also errs in limiting emergency loans to eight
months. Neither of these defects would be hard to fix.
</P>
<P>
   As for the World Bank, the commission would justifiably
eliminate lending to countries whose credit ratings permit them to
tap private capital markets. It would concentrate the bank's money
on fighting poverty in the world's 80 or so poorest countries. The
commission also recommends that the bank use grants rather than
loans to pay for its programs. To vaccinate children, for example,
the bank would solicit bids and pay for the vaccines itself as they
are actually delivered. The idea is to reduce corruption and waste.
Switching to grants would require more money from the donor
countries _ which the report strongly advocates. This may be
possible, but is far from assured.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is not expected to act on the report soon. But some
politicians are already denouncing the commission, wrongly, for
dismantling the IMF and the World Bank. The danger is that
political squabbling will squander an opportunity for Democrats and
Republicans to reach an important agreement. The IMF and World Bank
need to sharpen their focus and improve their programs. The first
step toward these goals is to lift the debts that keep desperately
poor countries trapped in poverty.

   PHILADELPHIA _ Just before the Philadelphia Flower Show opened
on Sunday under the banner ``Gardens for the New Millennium,''
Edward L. Lindemann, its director, felt like a chef who had planned
an impossibly ambitious menu and was suddenly hearing the guests at
the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm thinking, `Why did I do it?''' said Lindemann, slumped
on a sofa in his second floor office at the Pennsylvania Convention
Center. ``It'' was taking the flower show, so to speak, 100 years
into the future, imagining what Philadelphia would be like if all
the people who fled to the suburbs returned to live and work in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Would windmills and solar panels provide clean energy? Would
people grow vegetables on roofs and collect rain for water? Would
music be more dissonant? Would art have a harder edge?
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a big order. No wonder this man looked tired. But
somehow it all came together by Sunday, when 50,000 spring-starved
garden lovers moved through more than 100 full-scale exhibits and
2,500 amateur entries like a sea of honeybees drunk on pollen.
Maybe it was a pine tree with gold needles that grabbed them, or
the charred rain forest, or the chartreuse viburnum blossoms and
impossibly curved tulips looking positively imprisoned in metal.
</P>
<P>
   Lindemann, who nudged his exhibitors to mix more theater into
their horticulture for this year's show, which runs through Sunday,
walked me though an exhibit by the American Institute of Floral
Designers that features 19 arrangements of plants and metal and
silvery paint that neither God nor evolution could have wrought in
a million years.
</P>
<P>
   He spread his hands before an altarlike structure dripping with
orchids and succulents. A gazing ball gleamed inside a box with a
round hole. A few pussy willows poked out, and there was a
scepterlike object covered with green leaves. ``I think that's
equisetum molded onto a ball,'' Lindemann said. ``I think this is
the perfect marriage of architecture and nature.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't quite see it, but we wandered on, along an undulating
path of plastic beads. A light show pulsed like a heartbeat, and
trumpets and timpani played an upbeat processional. Ginger blossoms
and balls of crumpled aluminum appeared to be sliding down a
waterfall of narrow refrigerator shelves. Acacia pods dangled from
a metal tower. Yellow orchids as delicate as butterflies hung from
a steel ball that looked a bit like Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to head for the woodland gardens full of redbuds and
dogwoods that are thankfully still at the show _ the nurseries and
horticultural schools apparently think the millennium won't look
all that different _ but Lindemann was moving toward the central
exhibit, ``An Urban Garden Neighborhood,'' by Philadelphia Green,
the Philadelphia Horticultural Society's urban greening program,
which started helping neighborhoods turn rubble-strewn lots into
gardens about 25 years ago. Philadelphia Green works with more than
800 community groups on projects that include planting street trees
and designing pocket parks. Proceeds from the show _ about $1
million last year _ help that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could do that much in 25 years, what could we do in 100
years?'' Lindemann asked. That question led to this year's theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest problem is vacant land,'' he said, referring to
the city's 30,000 empty lots and the flight of the middle class.
``So this is our vision of all those problems being corrected.
People come back to live in the city. They come for housing and
work and entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the designers also had concerns about a computerized world
in danger of becoming sterile, where even more people compete for
fewer resources. Thus ``every plant will become precious,''
Lindemann said. He strolled by a backyard with rows of
hydroponically grown coffee plants, and another where a city farmer
has planted every space with greens, apple trees and grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of a green city infuses almost every exhibit. A video
shows how the area surrounding the Philadelphia City Hall looks now
_ treeless and made for cars _ and then transforms the same streets
to a world without traffic: a sea of flowers, shrubs and trees. A
piano solo by Keith Jarrett accompanies the transformation. (``It
came to me when I was driving home late one night,'' Lindemann
said.)
</P>
<P>
   Even Waldor Orchids caught the environmental fever this year.
This company can be counted on every year for a grand display of
perfect orchids, but this year it produced a tropical forest with
two diametrically opposed futures. One side blooms with thousands
of healthy plants; the other is a charred ruin of blackened trees
and dead orchids with a bulldozer parked in its midst. ``Extinction
is forever,'' one sign reads; another sums up the dead end of
``slash and burn'' agriculture, in which trees are cut down and
burned to make room for cattle and cropland.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry. Just around the corner are plenty of lush
plantings, waterfalls and fountains. J. Franklin Styer Nurseries
has an enormous clock rising over a landscape of trees made of
hummingbird feeders and blown-glass vases, and fountains that arch
like surgical tubes over a perfectly round pond.
</P>
<P>
   Stoney Bank Nurseries has some show-stopper plants, from a
camperdown elm to a winged euonymous with the most delicate of
green buds just beginning to flower. The art of forcing plants is
at its best here. And don't miss the graceful gate made of bamboo,
designed by Greg and Camille Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   After all the time travel into the future, I was glad to restore
myself in the bog gardens designed by the regional office of the
federal Environmental Protection Agency and a children's garden
full of fat tomatoes and pink and blue sweet peas set up by the
department of ornamental horticulture and environmental design at
Delaware Valley College in Doylestown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The usual magic is everywhere you look, from 5-foot zinnias to a
15-foot topiary giraffe. Samuel M.V. Hamilton's Clivia miniata,
which is the size of a Volkswagen bug, won a red ribbon this year.
And the North American Rock Garden Society did a bang-up job with
its tiny gardens in stone troughs. Clifton West and John Ray won a
blue ribbon for a little world of azure gentians, miniature
rhododendrons, saxifrage and primula.
</P>
<P>
   I used to grumble about flower shows. ``So fake! So silly!''
Then I realized that was the whole point and started to enjoy
myself. The lava lamps were fab. I wonder if I should enter that
cactus that looks like a brain next year.

SHARPTON IS SENTENCED TO 10 DAYS FOR PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton was sentenced Wednesday to 10 days in jail
for blocking traffic on the Atlantic City Expressway last summer
during a protest against racial profiling by the New Jersey State
Police.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors dropped charges against 73 other protesters who were
among about 200 people who closed down the expressway on July 3, to
condemn state troopers for a pattern of stopping minority drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was prompted by an incident in April 1998 when two
state troopers stopped a van of black and Hispanic men and opened
fire when the van began to roll backward on the shoulder of the
highway. The troopers were indicted on charges of attempted murder
and assault after details of widespread racial profiling emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also helped bring about a federal investigation
into racial profiling nationwide, and led Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman to acknowledge that the practice was common among New
Jersey troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton seemed to welcome the sentence as a way to publicize
his cause. ``I think it's a small price to pay,'' he said, ``to
bring national attention to racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said that he would announce on Saturday whether his
lawyer would appeal. Otherwise, he must surrender within 20 days
and pay $310 in court costs. He would then spend 10 days in an
Atlantic City jail.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before Judge Bruce Weekes of municipal county court
Wednesday, Sharpton's lawyer, Michael Hardy, depicted his client as
a martyr and said Atlantic City would join the ranks of celebrated
cities of protest like Selma and Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant municipal prosecutor, Michael Mosca, argued that
Sharpton had to be punished and that the sit-in could have caused
delays for emergency medical vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In sentencing Sharpton, Weekes said: ``No matter how noble the
cause, you cannot commit an independently illegal act. There are
too many other ways'' to protest.
</P>
<P>
   Already scripting his days in jail, Sharpton said that he would
invite other civil rights activists to visit him there, including
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Kweisi Mfume, the president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

RODMAN'S LAST TIRADE MAY HAVE LONG-TERM BENEFITS FOR MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be a first for anyone to ever applaud Worm Rodman for
making sense, but ...
</P>
<P>
   On Mark Cuban, there was this latest observation from His
Wormness:
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't need to be hanging around the players like he's a
coach or something. That's like Jerry Jones, and it's dumb. That's
why the Cowboys went down. He needs to be the owner, step back and
put people in who can get this team in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. It's a direct hit for Worm, although Rodman turning his
studded tongue on his one local benefactor was yet another example
of the loose cannon Cuban hauled on board.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, however, the Mavericks' deck was de-Wormed yesterday.
No more Dennis. No more loose cannon. Rodman was released. Just
like that.
</P>
<P>
   For those attempting to connect the dots between the Worm's
sniping at Cuban and his quick exit, spare me the details.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban gets enough credit from here for not being that
thin-skinned. ``If I was worried about personal criticism, I
wouldn't have signed Dennis to start with,'' Cuban said last night.
</P>
<P>
   As he charts his Mavericks' ownership course, there is much to
like about Cuban, at least if you are grading on the curve. Instead
of doing a tip-toe into pro sports, Cuban has kicked down the door
and barged in with a rah-rah charm that prompts us in the media to
openly scoff. One problem, however, with us in the media _ we don't
buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   What Cuban has actually accomplished over the last three months
is amazing. He has personally connected with the rank-and-file
fandom, and in doing so, completely re-energized a franchise that
had been reduced to distant memory status by the paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Give Cuban some time to sort through ownership rights and
wrongs, while taking his bruises, and then judge him a year or two
down the road. At the moment, he's like a big goofy fan trying to
ace Ownership 101.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process, Cuban claims to be following a ``basketball
first'' agenda. ``It made no sense to keep Dennis with us now being
out of the playoff picture,'' Cuban said. ``If we were three games
away from a playoff spot right now, Dennis would be here. But at
this point I'm not for Nellie \RDon Nelson\S keeping a kid on the
bench to play a 38-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's unsolicited ``advice'' for Cuban was an opinion-echo
from here that has been delivered more than once. Of course, Worm
is correct, but the additional impact was that Rodman bit the only
NBA hand that wanted to feed him.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis was in no-team land. His welcome is totally worn out in
this league. He was never going to work again until Cuban arrived
from Dot Com Geeksville to give Rodman one last stage to perform a
well-known act.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who eagerly informed Cuban of the mistake he
made in signing Rodman, the Worm's scolding of the owner in Seattle
was yet another example of evidence to the contrary. Rodman said
what needed to be said by someone other than the media.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Worm brought headlines to the Mavericks and put butts in
seats at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to timing, Rodman's release was perfect. Cuban
said from the start that when Dennis was no longer a basketball
fit, there would be no more Worm. And so he's gone. Here's why it
had to happen now:
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week or so, Rodman placed yellow police tape
around himself, establishing an off-limits boundary with the rest
of the team.
</P>
<P>
   During the latest string of losses for the Mavericks, Dennis
repeatedly retreated into a locker room mentality of ``it's their
fault, not mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own twisted logic, this was apparently Rodman's way of
showing leadership. Even in his best days, Dennis was a role player
on championship teams in Chicago. He is not a leader, and when he
attempted to be one in San Antonio, the results were not pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Worm's strange finger-pointing had escalated over four
consecutive games, starting with the tough New Jersey loss
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Rodman arrived, the Mavericks had been surprisingly
successful, at least compared to normal standards, because of a
work ethic and because of a team concept. That last part would
surely have disappeared as Worm continually attempted to place
himself above a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Many voices will be saying, ``Told you so. Told you it would
never work with Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, however, it did work. Cuban plunged when he
insisted on signing Rodman, yet the initial splash was bigger than
originally thought. But Worm wore out his welcome by taking himself
far too seriously as a leader and player.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban listened to Rodman, so if he heard what Rodman said about
Cuban, then Dennis did the Mavericks a long-term favor.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, it will be his last one. {Randy Galloway is a

POWER COMPANY PLANS THREE-UNIT CONVERSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a decade of seeking to grow by merging with another
company, Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. is turning inward in a bid
to increase the company's value.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which until recently was attempting to merge with
Western Resources Inc., will now focus on remaking itself. KCP&AMP;L
executives hope the move will unleash more of the company's
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strategy makes sense; it isn't rocket science,'' said
Drue Jennings, chief executive officer of KCP&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which must be approved by regulators, includes
converting KCP&AMP;L into a holding company with three units: power,
retail-distribution and deregulated businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The plan doesn't include finding a company to merge with _ a
cornerstone of the utility's strategy through the '90s _ although
KCP&AMP;L won't rule out a deal if approached.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, the consequences are far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L's power plant unit could find itself competing with other
utilities to supply electricity to the retail-distribution unit,
which would resell the electricity to the utility's customers. The
unit also could sell more power wholesale _ a market where price
isn't regulated _ and even consider building more plants to make
such extra power available.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution unit, by shopping around for power, could be in
a better position to woo customers to stay with KCP&AMP;L instead of
choosing another utility.
</P>
<P>
   The deregulated-businesses unit would mirror the utility's
current KLT Inc. subsidiary. The unit could raise public awareness
of KCP&AMP;L's other holdings, such as its 47 percent stake in a
fiberoptic company.
</P>
<P>
   At minimum, KCP&AMP;L executives think the reorganization will give
the company's valuation a boost by highlighting its various
businesses and giving them the flexibility to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sum of the parts is worth more than the whole,'' said
Bernie Beaudoin, KCP&AMP;L's president.
</P>
<P>
   For KCP&AMP;L employees, the proposed changes could affect how some
of them are paid, particularly in the power and deregulated
divisions. Some changes have already occurred in the deregulated
businesses, giving many employees ``pay for performance'' as part
of their compensation.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L's new strategy came about quickly after KCP&AMP;L in early
January ended its proposed merger with Western Resources. KCP&AMP;L had
expected the merged company to give it the size necessary to cope
with deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   But Jennings said doubts about the merger began to rise in the
second quarter of 1999 because of problems at Protection One Inc.,
the monitored-security firm that is 85 percent owned by Western.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing decline of Western's stock, which affected what
would be paid to KCP&AMP;L shareholders, sealed the deal's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too bad, but it had to be terminated,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all for naught. Some of the planning about how the
merged company would have been organized was salvaged and used in
KCP&AMP;L's current reorganizing plans.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think the new structure could eventually attract
more suitors interested in one or more of the units. Others think
the utility _ after the Western merger failed _ was at risk of
being swallowed up by another company tempted by KCP&AMP;L's low stock
price, which at the close Wednesday was 23 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Ford, an analyst for ABN Amro, wrote after KCP&AMP;L parted
with Western that KCP&AMP;L's stock price didn't reflect the value of a
low-cost provider of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that value will be realized in the stock or another
suitor will emerge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ford, an example of increasing valuation is Digital
Teleport Inc., which is building a fiberoptic network. The company
is 47 percent owned by KCP&AMP;L but doesn't make much of a splash as
just part of KCP&AMP;L. But as a centerpiece of the
deregulated-businesses unit, Digital Teleport could draw more
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Though many details remain to be decided, the overall
reorganization will go forward, pending approval by Kansas,
Missouri and federal regulators. Those approvals could take up to
two years.
</P>
<P>
   No new state laws are required to form the holding company and
the three units, according to KCP&AMP;L. But future moves, especially
those that affect consumers whose service is regulated, could
require legislative action.

   Strapped for Labor, U.S. Lets Illegal Workers Stay
</P>
<P>
   In a booming economy running short of labor, hundreds of
thousands of illegal immigrants are increasingly tolerated in the
nation's workplaces. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has
made crossing the border harder than ever, but once inside the
country, illegal immigrants are now largely left alone. The new
lenience helps explain why overall wage increases have been less
than many economists and policy-makers had expected, given an
unemployment rate of only 4 percent and a strong demand for people
to fill jobs that pay $8 an hour or less.
</P>

   The economy's record expansion showed no signs of slowing in the

Health Plans of California and the ING Group, a Dutch financial

Tuesday only served to cement the view among investors that
anything nontech is a nonstarter. Although it is not immediately
evident in the broad market indexes, most shares are currently

EDITORIAL: NEW RULES ON ORGANIC FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for its editions of
Thursday, March 9:
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997 the Department of Agriculture proposed rules that
would have established a nationwide certification program for
organic foods. During the 90-day comment period that followed, it
became clear just how badly the department had stumbled. Rather
than heed the advice of its own National Organic Standards Board,
the agency would have allowed the use of irradiation, sewage sludge
and genetically modified organisms in the growing and preparation
of foods to be called organic. Whatever one thinks of those
particular practices, they are hardly what most people would
consider ``organic.'' The outcry from consumers and organic farmers
forced reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the agency released a Revised Proposed Rule. It is a
dramatically improved document that may signal a significant new
direction at Agriculture. To quote the department's own press
release, the new rule ``specifically prohibits the use of genetic
engineering, sewage sludge, and irradiation in the production of
food products labeled `organic.''' It also offers a strict standard
defining what constitutes an organic food, a step that should do a
great deal to enhance consumer trust that a food labeled organic
really is organic.
</P>
<P>
   For raw products to be deemed 100 percent organic, for example,
they must be grown or manufactured without added hormones,
pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. The new rules do not reflect a
judgment on the relative safety or quality of organic foods as
compared with conventional foods. Rather, they govern marketing
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The department's response to the community of organic farmers
may herald a welcome new sensitivity to a sector of the farming
world that has suffered from official neglect. The Clinton
administration now needs to approve a final rule before it leaves
office. The Agriculture Department should take what it has learned
in developing these regulations _ especially the act of listening
intently to farmers _ and apply it to other programs that affect
small farmers. For their part, consumers and farmers should
recognize the power they wield when they work together.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO TRUSTED THE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PHILIP TAUBMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Levi, who died on Tuesday, brought the simple gift of
integrity to Washington when he became attorney general in 1975. In
the two brief years that he led the Justice Department, Levi set an
example of respect for the Constitution and the rights of Americans
that remains a benchmark for distinguished public service today.
Few of his successors at Justice have come close to that high
standard, and several have fallen abysmally short. That is good
reason to recall Levi's principled, fair-minded performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and its most prominent component, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, were reeling from the Watergate
scandal and other abuses of power when President Ford persuaded
Levi to give up his job as president of the University of Chicago
to move to Washington. Richard Nixon's first attorney general, John
Mitchell, and his minions had debased the department and the FBI by
using them to intimidate opponents of the Vietnam War. Justice
aides had shielded the Nixon campaign apparatus from investigation.
The FBI, deformed by J. Edgar Hoover's misrule, operated with
disdain for civil liberties. Eliot Richardson stood against this
tide of misconduct during his tenure as attorney general, and his
resignation in the face of Nixon's demand for the dismissal of
Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor, was a courageous
and uncompromising act.
</P>
<P>
   But fundamental reform of the department and the FBI was
impossible as long as Nixon remained in power. Levi, a
mild-mannered intellectual and legal scholar, was little known in
Washington, though he had worked for the Justice Department and the
House of Representatives in the 1940s. With his signature bow tie
and thick glasses, he hardly looked ready for political combat. But
Levi, unlike so many attorneys general, did not come to Washington
with a partisan political agenda or a desire to protect the
president who appointed him.
</P>
<P>
   He was guided instead by a reverence for the Constitution and a
commitment to take politics out of law enforcement. Levi insisted
that the Justice Department follow the law wherever it led
prosecutors, and he established the first clear ethical guidelines
for the operations of the FBI. He would not tolerate mail theft,
burglary, improper wiretaps, illegal surveillance or harassment of
citizens exercising their right to protest government policies. He
forced the bureau and the department to investigate wrongdoing
within their own ranks. These reforms largely remain in place
today.
</P>
<P>
   My first assignment for this newspaper when I was hired in 1979
was to cover the Justice Department. Levi had by then returned to
Chicago. But his cleansing influence was still felt in the
corridors of the Justice Department building on Pennsylvania
Avenue. Morale, shattered by Watergate, was slowly coming back,
propelled by Levi's belief in the sanctity of the law. Across the
street, the FBI was under the direction of a former federal judge,
William Webster, who was trying to make the bureau live by the Levi
code of conduct. Officials occasionally cursed at the standards,
complaining that they were impractical or too academic. But for
most of the career employees, the legacy of Edward Levi was a
tonic. He had restored faith in the rule of law.

RANGERS PONDER FUTURE WASHINGTON CONNECTIONS
</HEADLINE>

By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ The possibility of their former owner
becoming the next president intrigues the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a good thing,'' pitcher Darren Oliver said before
his workout yesterday morning. ``I might go into politics someday.
I could say, `Hey, I know the president.' It could only help, but
nobody would believe me anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who along with Rusty Rose headed the
ownership group that purchased the Rangers in April 1989, may have
secured his bid to become the Republican presidential nominee with
primary victories in California, New York, Ohio and four other
states on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explained manager Johnny Oates' smile yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man,'' Oates said. ``I think he's the right man
for the job. I take that back. I ``know'' he's the right man for
the job, and, yes, I feel very good today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's main challenger for the Republican nomination, Arizona
Sen. John McCain, is expected to pull out of the race soon. That
would leave Bush on track for a November clash with Vice President
Al Gore, the likely Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, at least those who knew Bush when he was an owner,
like the idea of having someone associated with the team in the
White House, no matter his politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him,'' pitcher Kenny Rogers said of Bush. ``He was
always willing to do the things it took for us to be competitive,
but he never got in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Added left fielder Rusty Greer, ``I'd like to see him become our
next president, if for nothing else because I know him. He always
treated me well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush served as the Rangers' managing general partner before
being elected governor in November 1994. Bush then placed his
interest in the Rangers in a blind trust until Tom Hicks purchased
the franchise in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he isn't just endorsing Bush because of his former
association with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to what he has to say,'' Rogers said of Bush's
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he has discussed philosophies and shared ideas during
brief talks with Bush at The Ballpark in Arlington. He isn't
expecting the chance to offer any advice on how to beat Gore,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've offered to do anything I can to help him,'' Oates said.
``Hopefully, it wouldn't hurt him, but he hasn't called yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also made this prediction: ``I'm sure he wouldn't cause
as many distractions as the guy in there now.''

 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For prosecutors, the testimony of police officers is
often the bedrock of their efforts to win criminal indictments and
convictions. In many cases, the outcome hinges on whether jurors
believe the account of an officer, like an undercover narcotics
officer who buys drugs or a detective who extracts a confession.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, juries have tended to accept the officers'
accounts without question. But during the last year, prosecutors
say, they have seen a change: Grand jurors in Manhattan have been
more intensively scrutinizing the testimony of police officers and
other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a trend for jurors to be more inquisitive, more
skeptical, asking for more information about the circumstances of a
police stop,'' said James M. Kindler, chief assistant district
attorney in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And in Queens, juries are deadlocking in an increasing number of
cases, a sign, prosecutors fear, that jurors are questioning the
veracity of officers' testimony as cases like the police shooting
of Amadou Diallo and the torture of Abner Louima continue to
dominate headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt in my mind that when it is generally
believed that cops are corrupt and engaged in brutality, that
perception will find its way into the jury room,'' said the Queens
district attorney, Richard A. Brown. ``I fear that that,
regrettably, may be occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Because jury deliberations, particularly grand jury proceedings,
are secret, it is difficult to gauge the shift in jurors' attitudes
toward police testimony. So far, prosecutors say, the increased
skepticism has had little concrete impact. Grand juries in
Manhattan are indicting criminal suspects at the same rate as they
have in the past, and the number of hung juries in Queens remains
relatively small compared with the vast number of criminal cases
each year in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But several prosecutors said that in some cases, grand juries
had stepped beyond their authority by raising issues that, by law,
only a judge can decide, like asking whether officers were
justified in stopping or arresting a suspect, or whether they
collected evidence properly. At other times, officers have been
called back to answer additional questions.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said that if a dubious view of the police was
growing among jurors, whether such a view was justified or not,
steps should be taken to address it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police testimony is at the very heart of the criminal justice
system,'' said Gerald Lynch, a professor at Columbia Law School.
``If the public does not have the confidence in the police, then
acquittals or hung juries will become increasingly routine.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in jurors' attitudes has been most surprising in
Manhattan and Queens, boroughs whose residents are thought to have
a more favorable opinion of the police than those of the Bronx or
Brooklyn. In those boroughs, prosecutors said they had seen no
significant change in the way jurors treat the police.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney, Robert
T. Johnson, said his office's conviction rate had dropped and the
grand jury dismissal rate risen in recent years, but he said he did
not know why. Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney,
said his office had seen no increase in grand juror skepticism or
hung juries.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a police spokeswoman, said the department welcomed
aggressive scrutiny by grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thorough review by a grand jury is commendable,'' she said.
``The Police Department doesn't shy away from that. It's a good
thing when grand jurors take their responsibility seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan prosecutors would not discuss specific cases and said
that grand jurors were asking more questions of all witnesses, as
well as of police officers. More than half of the witnesses who
appear before grand juries are officers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Queens district attorney, said the number of hung
juries in routine trials in Queens had risen sharply, particularly
in the last five months. He said that 9.6 percent of trials in 1999
ended in hung juries, with the increase beginning in the final
three months of last year. In the first two months of this year, 10
trials, or 23.2 percent of the total, ended in hung juries, he
said, a rate not seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm troubled by the increase,'' Brown said. ``I think because
of the perception that's out there, you're finding that jurors
oftentimes are questioning the credibility of police testimony,
perhaps a lot more than they've been doing in the past.'' He called
for the department to continue efforts to diversify the force and
increase training as a way to restore public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that police scandals had affected
jurors' perceptions of the police. Walter Mack is a former head of
the Police Department's Internal Affairs Division who helped
investigate corruption in Harlem in the early 1990s. During that
scandal inquiry, it was found that some officers lied under oath so
frequently that they coined a term for it, ``testilying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a reaction when the police are being
criticized,'' Mack said. ``Grand jurors and petit jurors are going
to be reluctant to accept what the police have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Vitullo-Martin, a jury expert at the Vera Institute of
Justice in Manhattan, praised the assertiveness of grand juries,
which she said were created as a buffer to allow citizens, not
prosecutors, to decide whether someone should be charged with a
serious crime. Vitullo-Martin, whose car was recently stopped in a
check on seat belt use, called the officers involved in that sweep
``astonishingly arrogant.'' She said an increased distrust of the
police could be an unintended byproduct of the Giuliani
administration's aggressive police tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any encounter with the police in which the police are
exercising their authority is bound to have an effect on a juror,''
she said. ``This may be the natural outcome of too many encounters
with the police.''

QWEST MERGER TALKS WITH DEUTSCHE TELEKOM MAY BE REVIVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After negotiations by Qwest Communications International for an
acquisition by Deutsche Telekom essentially collapsed on Tuesday,
Qwest's chairman, Joseph P. Nacchio, spent much of Wednesday
putting together a proposal meant to bring the German company back
to the bargaining table, executives close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Qwest, a fast-growing long-distance communications
company, agreed to acquire U S West Inc., one of the American
regional Bell companies. People close to Deutsche Telekom said that
on Tuesday, the company essentially shut down its negotiations to
acquire Qwest because of fears over how much it would have to pay
for U S West.
</P>
<P>
   But the people close to Deutsche Telekom said that Wednesday,
the big German phone company received word from Qwest trying to
reopen the discussions and that it indicated it was willing to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Qwest's closing share price Wednesday of $53.4375, U S
West would receive nearly $47 billion under its merger deal.
Deutsche Telekom appears reluctant to match Qwest's offer for U S
West. But U S West has little reason to accept a lesser deal from
the German company. Qwest's market value is around $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For at least a year, Deutsche Telekom has been seeking ways to
expand outside its home market. As the company's Global One joint
venture collapsed last year, Deutsche Telekom tried to acquire
Telecom Italia, but Olivetti wooed that company away from its
German suitor.
</P>
<P>
   Through Tuesday, U S West had not met face to face with Deutsche
Telekom, according to people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   If Qwest is to succeed in reigniting its discussions with
Deutsche Telekom, it may have to finally bring U S West into the
talks as a full partner.
</P>
<P>
   Offering to bring in U S West could potentially help Qwest's
cause with the German company because it would help allay Deutsche
Telekom's fear that U S West might sue for interference in its
pre-existing deal with Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   But bringing in U S West would not necessarily serve Qwest's
immediate interest.
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to Deutsche Telekom, that company
wants to minimize its involvement in splitting any spoils between
Qwest and U S West. So its past proposals have been made in a fixed
amount, leaving Qwest and U S West to decide how to split it. The
exact size of Deutsche Telekom's previous proposals was unclear
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Qwest kept U S West out of touch with Deutsche
Telekom, Nacchio could hope to make a better deal for his
shareholders than for U S West's. Bringing U S West into direct
contact with Deutsche Telekom could strengthen U S West's hand with
the German company at the expense of Nacchio.

VANCOUVER CANUCKS OPPOSE McSORLEY CHARGES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Outraged when the incident first happened, the
Vancouver Canucks were quick to accept the NHL's swift and severe
punishment of Boston's Marty McSorley for hitting Vancouver's
Donald Brashear in the head with his stick Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Team captain Mark Messier emphasized that the sport needed to
move beyond the ugly attack. The red-hot Canucks were doing that.
But, after learning that the British Columbia criminal justice
branch has charged McSorley with assault with a weapon, the Canucks
found themselves a bit bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   Some Canucks expressed concern yesterday that having the law
cross the line into the sporting arena sets a potentially dangerous
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of shocked,'' Canucks right winger Alexander
Mogilny said. ``I've been playing 11 years in the league, and I've
never seen anything happen like this. It's hockey; violence is
synonymous with hockey. You put the equipment on, you take a chance
when you go out there. I think it was a shock for everybody really
because everything was being taken care of by the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL preferred the matter remain in-house. If convicted,
McSorley could face 18 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next case that comes up, it's a fine line between them
deciding to take it to court and the league dealing with it,''
Canucks defenseman Greg Hawgood said. ``I think certainly you're
not going out there thinking that if you do something that you're
going to get arrested. Next time, who's to make the judgment what's
over the line and what isn't?''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven other NHL players have preceded McSorley into court for
on-ice infractions. All have been acquitted or handed minor
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Dino Ciccarelli, then of the Minnesota North Stars, is the most
recent player to appear in a courtroom for an on-ice incident. He
got one day in jail and a $1,000 fine for hitting Toronto
defenseman Luke Richardson on the head several times with his stick
in 1988. Now the question is whether criminal charges will prevent
a similar incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it will definitely provide a deterrent,'' Stars
forward Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``Those are extreme, isolated
incidents; none of that is good for the league.''

<P>
   Age discrimination is rampant, if not probably, then at least in
perception. Most 40-year-old-plus job hunters tell tales of
unanswered resumes, unreturned phone calls or unpleasant interviews
based on what they believe is age bias.
</P>
<P>
   Only a fraction of them take their claims to court, and an even
smaller fraction of the complaints are resolved in their favor. Age
bias is monstrously difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate interviewers know age discrimination is against the
law. Most are trained to avoid blatant age-related questions or
comments. Other than rejecting older applicants for being
``overqualified'' or ``too high-priced,'' little is said.
</P>
<P>
   Older job seekers are left with only the suspicion that their
age was a barrier. That's why I read with interest an age
discrimination study, ``No Foot in the Door,'' published last year
in the Journal of Aging &AMP; Social Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Using a systematic social science research technique, the Fair
Employment Council of Greater Washington and AARP sponsored four
pairs of job applicant testers. Each pair consisted of a
57-year-old and a 32-year-old, trained and equipped with equal
resumes and qualifications for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The pairs responded to 140 help-wanted ads and completed the
interview process, posing as actual job candidates, in 102 cases.
</P>
<P>
   The controlled study concluded: ``Older applicants received a
more favorable response than younger applicants in 1 percent of the
tests, while younger applicants received a more favorable response
than their older partners 42.2 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The net disadvantage to older workers was 41.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``approximately three-quarters of the net disadvantage to
older applicants _ 31.4 percent out of 41.2 percent _ occurred at
the pre-interview stage. Thus, while older testers fared less well
than their younger counterparts in all phases of the application
process, the majority of their disadvantage arose immediately upon
contacting employers, before they could present their
qualifications fully. As the title of this paper states, they could
not get their foot in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment also found that when employers used employment
agencies to screen applicants, the older applicants were treated
less favorably than their younger counterparts 84 percent of the
time, compared with 29 percent when no intermediary agency was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   But, after obtaining the statistical indication of age bias, the
testers' experiences couldn't add much detail. Explicit negative
comments to older applicants were reported in only 2.9 percent of
the interviews.
</P>
<P>
   And, in more indirect rebuffs, only 13.8 percent of the older
applicants were told their salary expectations were too high. Five
other stereotypes about older workers _ lack of energy, rigidity,
technological obsolescence, lack of motivation or physical
limitations _ were mentioned in even fewer cases.
</P>
<P>
   The study ended with the workplace perception that older workers
started with: Age hurts, and it's hard to know exactly how to stop
the ache.

TONY GEORGE SCORES WITH FORMULA ONE AT INDY 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mere mention of Tony George's name usually is enough to trigger
an argument among motorsports fans.
</P>
<P>
   Most would agree that George's decision to bring the NASCAR
Winston Cup Series to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1994 was
an act of sheer genius. Or given NASCAR's runaway popularity, a
no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Many would contend that George's decision to launch the Indy
Racing League in 1996, prompting a schism that continues to divide
and dilute domestic open-wheel racing, was an act of sheer
arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   So, what are we to think about George's successful quest to lure
Formula One back to the United States, to the most famous address
in American motorsports? F1 will unpack its crates the week of
Sept. 24 at the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road in
Indianapolis, at the Speedway owned by George and his family.
</P>
<P>
   I'm lining up with Mr. George on this one, convinced the
permanent home IMS will provide and the current boom in motorsports
worldwide will make the inaugural United States Grand Prix at
Indianapolis a got-to-be-there event.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 F1 schedule begins in Australia this weekend with an
intriguing story line. Two-time and reigning World Driving Champion
Mika Hakkinen of Finland is in position to join Juan Manuel Fangio
as only the second driver to win three consecutive F1
championships. Hakkinen and McLaren International teammate David
Coulthard of Great Britain will be pitted against their storied
rivals, reigning constructors' champion Scuderia Ferrari, where
1994-95 F1 champion Michael Schumacher of Germany has been paired
with new teammate Rubens Barrichello of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The race at Indy will be Round 15 of 17 composing the Federation
Internationale de l'Automobile World Championship. The race at IMS
will cover 73 laps over a 2.606-mile road course carved into the
Speedway's infield. The course also will incorporate portions of
the 2.5-mile oval track, most notably the frontstretch, where the
cars will race clockwise from the bottom of Turn 1, past the yard
of bricks at the start/finish line and into Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, opposite of the direction used by
competitors in the IRL's Indianapolis 500 and NASCAR's Brickyard
400. Like the course its drivers will race on, F1 at Indy initially
figures to be an acquired taste. But George, the president of IMS,
is convinced that motorsporting America really does get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be a successful event,'' said George, who
brokered the deal to bring F1 back with Bernie Ecclestone,
president of the powerful Formula One Constructors Association.
``The key is to put on an entertaining race that will sustain that
interest. Formula One has been criticized for not having much of a
show, but I think they're aware of what it takes to be successful
in the United States, with competition for the entertainment dollar
being what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   F1's glory days in the United States were recorded during a
20-year run from 1961-80 on the famed road course at Watkins Glen
(N.Y.) International. But F1 exited the United States in 1991 after
the second of two poorly promoted and attended street races in
Phoenix. That followed earlier stops in Long Beach, Calif., Las
Vegas, Detroit and Dallas _ venues where the sport priced itself
out of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a following for Formula One in this
country, it's just waned a bit,'' said George, who added the
Speedway already has received more ticket applications for the F1
race than it did for the inaugural Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an early indication that it will be a different fan,''
George said, meaning a global fan. ``We're trying to expand our
customer base, and that's good. Formula One is not going to be as
profitable as the Indy 500 or the Brickyard 400. But as far as it
being a jewel in a crown, it's going to be every bit of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevy change sets stage for `Aero Wars' rhetoric Expect a
weekend's worth of ``Aero Wars'' whining at Atlanta Motor Speedway
beginning tomorrow, when Chevrolet teams practice and qualify with
revised front air dams on their beleaguered 2000 Monte Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials announced Monday that Chevy teams will be
allowed to extend their front air dams two inches below the bumper,
with the intention of creating more front downforce. Through the
season's first three races, Chevy teams have complained that the
Monte Carlo is generating too much downforce on the rear end _
creating a lifting condition on the front of the car that reduces
traction through the corners and makes turning difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Petree, who fields the Monte Carlos driven by Joe Nemechek
and Kenny Wallace, said Tuesday morning that he honestly didn't
know what effect the ``kickout'' change will have on that
persistent ``pushing'' condition at the lightning-fast, 1.54-mile
AMS quadoval.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR is trying to do something to even out the cars,'' said
Petree, a former championship-winning crew chief with Dale
Earnhardt. ``It's the easiest, quickest thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Petree estimated the change could add 60 pounds of downforce to
the front end of the Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevy presented a car that we wanted \Rto NASCAR\S, and we
didn't get it,'' Petree said. ``They had some target numbers they
wanted us to hit ... and the car came in better than NASCAR wanted
to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Roush, who fields five Ford Taurus teams, said he believes
that 65 pounds of downforce would make the Monte Carlo an
aerodynamic match for the numbers Dale Jarrett's Daytona
500-winning Ford posted during wind tunnel testing after the season
opener last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``So \RNASCAR\S just said, `OK, you guys \RChevy\S screwed up.
This will fix you,' '' Roush said. ``I think they gave them instant
relief on their problem. It's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Petree said he ultimately would like to see the Monte Carlo get
an extended nose, and its template reshaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a lot of changes there,'' Petree said. ``We can
change this in a day and not change any of the templates. It's the
easiest thing right off, and we'll see what it does.''
QUICK HITS A financial casualty Rockwall-based TeamXtreme's
decision to replace popular John Hollansworth Jr. with Davey
Hamilton as its lead Indy Racing League driver was financially
driven.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of large associate \Rsponsors\S that were
tied to John that were lost,'' said John Lopes, team manager. ``We
had to do something from a financial standpoint to keep operation
of the team going. Davey's signing did make a significant financial
impact. We're also fortunate that Davey is a talented driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 37, is the only driver to have started all 35 IRL
races, including the 2000 season opener in January. He also is a
two-time championship runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Hollansworth, a 36-year-old resident of Dallas, was the only
rookie to qualify for all 10 races last year. He also was the
fastest rookie qualifier at the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is to put John back in a car as soon as possible,''
Lopes said. But Lopes added that might not be until the 2001
season.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton will drive the No. 16 TeamXtreme Lycos G Force/Aurora
as teammate to rookie Airton Dare. Lopes said a major sponsorship
announcement is planned before Round 2 of the series at Phoenix
International Raceway on March 19. Wives plan marrow benefit Racing
wives Kim Labonte, Brooke Gordon and Jada Nadeau have schedule the
``Hendrick Wives Luncheon for Life'' at The Renaissance Worthington
Hotel in Fort Worth on March 30.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon will benefit the Hendrick Marrow Program,
established in 1997 after Hendrick Motorsports founder Rick
Hendrick was diagnosed with leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   The program will feature a question-and-answer session with the
wives of Hendrick NASCAR Winston Cup drivers Terry Labonte, Jeff
Gordon and Jerry Nadeau, and a first-hand account from a marrow
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Seating is limited to 200 at $50 per person, or $500 for a table
of 10. To receive an order form, contact Scottie Lindsay at (704)
455-0555. Last laps A title sponsor for next month's NASCAR Busch
Grand National Series race at Texas Motor Speedway will be
announced during a news conference at the track this afternoon.

<P>
   TMS' ticket office will put on sale less than 1,000 frontstretch
seats for the April 2 NASCAR Winston Cup DirecTV 500 beginning at 9
a.m. tomorrow. The tickets, returned by either season ticket
holders or corporate sponsors, range from $70 to $96. Tickets can
be ordered by phone at (817) 215-8500 or purchased in person.
</P>
<P>
   Native Texan Bobby Labonte took over the Winston Cup points lead
for the first time in his eight-year career at Las Vegas Motor
Speedway Sunday. Reigning series champion Dale Jarrett, who trails
Labonte by only four points, had held the lead for the past 26
consecutive races dating to May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who won the March race at
Atlanta Motor Speedway in 1999 and two of the past three in
Hampton, Ga., has gone eight races without a top-five finish.
Including five races at the end of 1999, it the longest such streak
in Gordon's 226-race Cup career. Last words ``How fast is Atlanta?
Well, if your life flashes before your eyes there, you have to be
under 18 years of age to get it all in.''

 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So beguiling is its songfulness that ``Porgy and
Bess'' can conceal how complicated it really is. George Gershwin
called his piece ``a folk opera.'' The words might apply to
Carlisle Floyd's ``Susannah'' or the Douglas Moore ``Ballad of Baby
Doe'' _ both compact, simple in outline and beholden to the larger
musical impulses that shaped them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porgy and Bess,'' which opened the New York City Opera's
spring season on Tuesday, has larger ambitions. It also poses more
problems for the people who put it on. Gershwin's music begins at
the meeting place of black and Eastern European sensibilities,
namely, the American musical theater of the 1920s and '30s. But the
composer's assiduous studies of Southern culture and, more
important, his restless investigations into the European
avant-garde take him, for better or worse, beyond the aspirations
of an Irving Berlin or Jerome Kern.
</P>
<P>
   The operatic formula of principal singers in small handfuls plus
chorus is turned here into something almost impossibly dense.
Nearly every chorister in ``Porgy'' is an important solo performer,
and every principal a chorus member. Act I is a swirling street
scene with crap games, daily chores and flashes of extreme
violence, and it is here that the City Opera's new production
momentarily falters.
</P>
<P>
   The multiplicity is driven by Gershwin's unpredictable forward
movement and his insistence on taking popular-music harmony to the
point of near-atonality. So swept along are listeners by the sheer
charm of his materials that they tend not to notice the collision
courses on which all this sweet consonance has been set. Singers,
equally charmed and surprised, can find themselves on the wrong
pitch in unexpected keys; indeed, this is not easy music to sing.
Interestingly, Gershwin, deep in the embrace of Broadway and
Hollywood, was a fervent admirer of Alban Berg's ``Lyric Suite''
and made a point of paying homage to the composer while on a
European tour.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who arrived after intermission on Tuesday would have
thought themselves in the middle of a first-rate performance. By
this time, the vagaries of execution had passed. The orchestra
conducted by John DeMain seemed more settled into a style of
playing these players do not encounter every night. The singers had
ceased to press and fall into bouts of toneless shouting. Stage and
pit had found better ways of doing the same thing at precisely the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   This is, for the most part, a cast deep in quality. Anita
Johnson's pure soprano gave ``Summer Time'' its customary magic.
Angela Simpson's ``My Man's Gone Now'' was perhaps the grandest
moment. Dwayne Clark as Sportin' Life sang handsomely, and he is a
rubbery athlete onstage. Timothy Robert Blevins (Crown), an
excellent baritone, radiated the necessary menace. Kenneth Floyd
(Jake) and Sabrina Elayne Carten (Maria) had fine moments. Adina
Aaron's brief turn as the Strawberry Woman was winning indeed.
Porgy has much to compete with in the opening scenes, but Alvy
Powell's portrayal found its center later on. This is a powerful,
musicianly and well-directed deep voice. Powell, moreover, has a
presence: he occupies the stage when given the opportunity. Bess
was more of a problem. Marquita Lister has the looks and aura if
only she did not try so hard.
</P>
<P>
   Lister's overwrought behavior made Bess less a foxy loser than a
frantic neurotic. All that waving of arms, rolling of eyes,
clutching of brow and side-to-side staggering seemed to confuse
Gershwin's naturalistic opera with a low-rent production of ``Lucia
di Lammermoor.'' The voice is a little tired, but it can be very
effective. Lister might consider the possibility that Bess needs
less help.
</P>
<P>
   Tazewell Thompson (the director) and Julie Arenal (the
choreographer) see the Broadway side of ``Porgy.'' Ensembles become
elaborate dance numbers. They look fine _ as do the vivid fight
scenes _ but seem to pull ``Porgy'' out of its dramatic mood, the
story thread and its emotional baggage being interrupted if not
lost. If the choreography jars, however, it is valuable for
pointing out the contrariness of the piece itself, a ``folk opera''
in which high and low cultures are both partners and antagonists.
</P>
<P>
   The opera begins with built-in problems. When the music stops,
``Porgy and Bess'' falls into deep lulls. The visits of the police
are dead spots; purely spoken passages do not connect; they
separate. The City Opera's utilitarian set, borrowed from the
Sherwin Goldman production of the mid-1980s, will jibe with most
people's image of Catfish Row: a courtyard, ships' masts in the
background, three houses, one of which rotates to an interior. The
picnic on Kittiwah Island looks across the water to the Charleston
skyline.
</P>
<P>
   It is nice to have ``Porgy and Bess'' at the City Opera, a
company that by design and necessity minimizes spectacle and
directs our attention to other things. Performances will continue
in a steady stream. Perhaps Act I will have tightened. There are
some good singers here, and an opera that is both flawed and
profoundly beautiful.

   SWITZERLAND: AUSTRIA PROTEST
</P>
<P>
   Crowds demonstrated outside Parliament in Bern to protest an
official visit by Austria's foreign minister, Benita
Ferrero-Waldner, left. The decision to welcome Ferrero-Waldner runs
counter to the European Union's decision to freeze relations with
Austria because of the inclusion of the far-right Freedom Party in
its government. Switzerland is not a member of the union, and a
spokesman said it was traditional for the two neighbors to invite
new government members to visit.

   ITALY: JEWS UNHAPPY WITH POPE
</P>
<P>
   Several leading Jewish groups in Italy and the United States,
including the Anti-Defamation League, said they were not fully
satisfied with the apology that Pope John Paul II intends to give
Sunday for the historic errors of the Catholic Church. A Vatican
document outlining the theological precedents for the apology,
mentions, along with the Crusades and the Inquisition, the church's
past injustices toward Jews.

   GERMANY: NAZI TALKS CONTINUE
</P>
<P>
   The government said talks would resume March 21 in Berlin to try
to resolve a bitter dispute over how $5 billion in compensation for
Nazi-era slave workers and forced laborers should be divided. The
sum was agreed upon last December, but two days of talks in
Washington this week failed to resolve the question of who should
be the largest beneficiaries. The forced laborers are mainly
non-Jews from Central and East European countries overrun by Nazi
troops.

   The Basque separatist group ETA took responsibility for two car
bombings that have killed a Socialist Party leader and two security
officials since January. The rebels, in a statement in the Basque
newspaper Gara, also criticized two moderate Basque parties
competing in Sunday's general elections, while the leftist party
considered the rebels' political wing had not entered the race and
called on voters to abstain.

   North Korean officials ended a secret five-day trip to Ottawa,
an exchange for a similarly secret visit by three Canadian

USC RECRUIT WILL VISIT OTHER SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Travis Hanour's verbal commitment to USC is not
quite as solid as last week, as the 6-foot-6 guard from Laguna
Beach High has rescheduled a trip to Arizona for this weekend and
probably will visit Utah next month.
</P>
<P>
   Hanour committed to the Trojans on Feb. 27, and promptly
canceled his remaining recruiting trips to Arizona and Utah. But
Hanour said Wednesday that his father wanted him to visit those
schools before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to visit Arizona and maybe Utah after that,'' Hanour
said. ``Right now, I'm still committed (to USC). It doesn't really
change it. After I visit the other places, I'll be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanour, who averaged 25.7 points, 9.7 rebounds and 5.4 assists
at Laguna Beach, said he just wants to check out all his options.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if was definitely going to attend USC, Hanour said,
``I'm not really sure. Right now, USC is on top, but once I visit
the other places I'll be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanour was USC's No. 1 recruiting priority for the spring, and
the Trojans believe he can play point guard, shooting guard and
small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Practice at Sports Arena: The Trojans practiced Wednesday at the
Sports Arena, but it wasn't in response to the gas leak Tuesday
that forced part of the campus - including the Physical Education
building - to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   It just happened to be a day when the Sports Arena was available
for practice, and wasn't being used for another event. USC has
practiced there only a handful of times this season, because of
availability and cost factors.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for bid: USC coach Henry Bibby did not want to speculate
on whether the Trojans (14-14, 7-9) will make the National
Invitation Tournament, but said he would be happy to play in the
sometimes-maligned tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I be disappointed if we didn't get in? Yeah,'' Bibby
said. ``I'm not like UCLA, I want to get into any tournament. If we
don't, that's life. That's something you live with. We determined
our destination before these last two games. I can't be upset over
what happens now. I don't have any control over what happens
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   What might have been? Bibby lamented the Trojans' late-season
slide in which they lost eight of their past nine games, and went
3-7 when leading scorer Sam Clancy was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tearing me up because I know how good we can be,'' Bibby
said. ``We've been close in games even without Sam. I couldn't ask
the other guys to play harder. Am I disappointed in the kids? No.
They have fought for me. I don't think there's any game I was
disappointed with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Women of Troy update: USC's women's basketball team is in a
similar situation to the men. It probably cannot afford another
loss if it hopes to secure a bid to the women's NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to win both games,'' USC coach Chris Gobrecht
said.
</P>
<P>
   USC has already notified the tournament it will not host a
first-round game, which means the Women of Troy (13-13, 8-8) could
conceivably play Pepperdine in Malibu if they make the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   USC vs. WASHINGTON Tipoff: 7 p.m., Sports Arena. TV/Radio: No
TV; XTRA-AM (690)
</P>
<P>
   USC (14-14, 7-9) update: The Trojans are trying to keep their
NIT hopes alive and need to sweep the Washington schools. USC
defeated the Huskies 81-79 in overtime on Jan. 8. Forward Brian
Scalabrine (strained hip) will play, as will guard Jeff Trepagnier
(swollen eye). Forward Sam Clancy had minor swelling this week
after returning from his broken-right-foot injury but is OK and
will play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (10-18, 5-11) update: The Huskies are just happy that
a disappointing season is coming to a close. Washington has
struggled but won two of its past four games, including a stunning
67-58 victory over Oregon at McArthur Court on Feb. 19. It is 6-7
on the road, and senior Deon Luton is averaging 15.2 points per
game.

GERMANY'S NEW CHOICE FOR IMF CHIEF GETS TEPID RECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change spelling of Kohler to Koehler, and Hoerst to
Horst.)  
( mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defying warnings that history might repeat itself,
Germany began a diplomatic offensive to install one of its
nationals as head of the International Monetary Fund and received a
generally lukewarm reception Wednesday in both Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder began lobbying European neighbors
and the United States to support Horst Koehler, president of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to head the IMF.
But Schroeder misjudged, if he expected that his nation's allies
would quickly rally around the new German candidate after the first
one he promoted was forced to give up a four-month quest to lead
the monetary fund.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton pointedly declined to endorse Koehler in a
telephone conversation with the German chancellor Tuesday. White
House officials said the president had a friendly conversation with
Schroeder in which he took a neutral position on Koehler's
qualifications for the job.
</P>
<P>
   European officials also have not rushed to Germany's side.
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini delivered a frank public
assessment in which he said that Koehler was ``less than had been
hoped for.'' A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
Europe had not rallied behind Koehler, who once served as a close
aide to Helmut Kohl, Schroeder's longtime rival and predecessor as
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   French and Portuguese officials made much more positive
comments. But it seemed unlikely that Germany could forge an
immediate, Europe-wide consensus that Koehler ought to be the
region's unified choice to lead the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Germany's decision to throw its considerable
political heft behind a new candidate and campaign publicly for him
will work this time. Some German allies, including the United
States, are eager to avoid the impression that they are picking
fights with Germany, and Koehler is widely considered a better
choice than the previous candidate, Ciao Koch-Weser, Germany's
deputy finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   But it also seemed possible that Germany, by choosing a person
who does not top the lists of Europe's most qualified and
politically prominent financial officials, had set itself up for a
another stinging defeat. That is especially true because both
European and American officials have put a high priority on finding
someone who can quickly command support and end the prolonged and
divisive search for an IMF managing director.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the 182 member nations of the IMF rebuffed
Germany when they denied Koch-Weser, a close ally of Schroeder, a
majority of their votes in an informal poll. Koch-Weser had the
backing of the 15-nation European Union, which has named every IMF
managing director since the financial institution was created just
after World War II. But Europe's support was tepid, and Clinton
went public with his vow to stop the German's candidacy after
months of quiet diplomacy failed to dissuade Germany from promoting
him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other critics had argued that Koch-Weser,
a 25-year veteran of the World Bank and a specialist in poverty
relief, did not have the political stature or the financial
expertise to head the IMF, which has been likened to a world
central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler has considerably more financial experience and is better
known around Europe, but his background is in some ways similar to
Koch-Weser's.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, 57, was long allied with the Christian Democratic
Union, the party Schroeder defeated when he took power last year.
He served as an economic aide to Kohl, the longtime chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Koehler served in the No. 2 position at
Germany's finance ministry, the position Koch-Weser holds today. In
that job, Koehler helped manage Germany's financial relations with
Europe at a time when the region was working out the details of
monetary union. But he was better known for helping to arrange the
terms of unification with Germany's formerly Communist eastern
half, and then overseeing the massive injection of public funds
aimed at rebuilding the old East Germany. He also had a stint in
the private sector, managing Germany's federation of savings banks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Koehler now heads the London-based European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, a mini-World Bank that backs
development projects and businesses in Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. He took the post just after the quasi-public
bank wrote off tens of millions of dollars worth of loans when
Russia, its leading client, defaulted on its debt in the summer of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have declined to comment on
Koehler's candidacy. Moreover, they seem determined to avoid a
repeat of their role in defeating Koch-Weser, when Clinton publicly
played the heavy while some European countries hid their true
feelings behind the veil of European solidarity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But administration officials were also hoping that Europe would
select a candidate who would obviate the need for extended debate.
Among the several senior politicians in Europe talked about as
potential candidates are the current and former British chancellors
of the exchequer and the Italian finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support a European candidate, a candidate of maximum
stature, who can generate a consensus in Europe and support from
developing countries,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
Wednesday when asked about Germany's push for Koehler.
</P>
<P>
   Outside observers said that Koehler did have the resume of an
IMF leader.
</P>
<P>
   C. Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington said that Koehler had more financial expertise than
Koch-Weser and that he would do a good job at the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knock on him is this notion of stature _ that they want
someone who has had a Cabinet-level job in finance for the IMF,''
Bergsten said. ``There's also a sense that he hasn't really
distinguished himself at the EBRD.''

SONY LIGHTS CONVENTION, WHERE STARS SHINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LAS VEGAS _ The stars came out Wednesday at Showest, the
annual convention for movie theater owners and operators.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Entertainment hosted lunch on the third day of the four-day
confab and brought along such stars as Mel Gibson, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Matt Damon, Cameron Diaz, Bill Murray and Sandra
Bullock to promote their upcoming movies. The celebrities added
glitz to a conference that is more business than show business.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners seemed high on Gibson's summer release, ``The
Patriot.'' The trailer for the revolutionary war film, full of
action and combat, played to the biggest applause among the several
thousand exhibitors in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzenegger's ``Six Days,'' a drama about a human clone, also
received a warm response, as did a very brief look at the fall
release of ``Charlie's Angels,'' a film version of the '70s TV
jiggle show. The angels this time around are Diaz, Drew Barrymore
and Lucy Liu.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted with less enthusiasm was ``Godzilla 2000,'' which
apparently marks a return to the monster's cheesy Japanese roots.
The movie is a joint presentation of Sony and Japan's Toho Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the old Godzilla and high camp may take heart though:
This is the original rubbery and slightly clunky Godzilla, not the
streamlined and soulless lizard of the American movie of two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitors seemed thrilled by the announcement of sequels to
``Men in Black'' and ``Stuart Little,'' despite a lack of any
footage to see. Coming off a lackluster 1999 and early 2000 -
Sony's Garry Shandling comedy ``What Planet Are You From?'' had the
worst wide opening of any movie this year - Sony appears to have a
strong slate going into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibit halls, the main buzz was about digital film
projection.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that theaters will be receiving and projecting
films digitally on a regular basis within a few years, rather than
showing film on reels. The main questions that remain are how
quickly it will happen, which companies will dominate and who will
pay for it all.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners balk at the idea of spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars on new equipment when the studios could effect
significant savings by not having to pay for prints and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing seems clear: Not only are ticket prices going up,
but moviegoers are going to be targets of more and more marketing
when they plunk down their money at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Association of America, revealed that ticket prices in 1999 rose by
more than 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Movie posters will start to be replaced by interactive lobby
screens that show trailers, posters and commercials for other
products.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of kiosks that spit out tailored coupons, in exchange for
information on who you are and what you are watching, were getting
a lot of interest on the trade show floor.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Theater owners are looking for more ways to make money and
attract repeat business, and patrons don't seem to mind as long as
there is something in it for them.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Winter, president of Encino-based AndAction, which is
partnering with NEC to offer flat screens for promotional use in
theater lobbies, said: ``If the content is good, people will be
entertained. Quite simply, if the product isn't good, these things
will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan Miller, a representative of Fancard.net, a kiosk maker
based in Austin, Texas, said there must be give and take. ``If
people know we're not going to sell their information and they get
exclusive benefits, like sneak preview screenings, everyone is
happy.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Steve Francis doesn't act like your run-of-the-mill rookie. And he
certainly doesn't play like one, either.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Francis sure sounds like a typical rookie when he discusses
one subject _ the Utah Jazz, which the Rockets meet tonight at the
Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Just like every other rookie _ especially a rookie point guard _
who has ever run into the Jazz, Francis has some definite opinions
about how Utah plays the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I think they're a dirty team,'' Francis said. ``I think
they do a lot of grabbing and a lot of pushing. Karl Malone does a
lot of knee-into-the-stomach (on drives) and stuff like that, so we
have to be prepared for that and be aggressive. We have a lot of
guys on our team who can get dirty, too. Hopefully, it'll be a war,
and we'll be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly can seem like war, what with all the bodies that
hit the floor during a typical Utah game.
</P>
<P>
   John Stockton brings the ball upcourt, running his man through a
forest of picks before finally introducing the defender to Malone,
whose rugged picks are legendary. And Utah's penchant for
``extracurricular'' activity is also usually a subject of
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley endured that initiation last year as a rookie
point guard, and he is helping to counsel Francis on maintaining
his focus against the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be so smart,'' Mobley said. ``That's the best
fundamental team in the league, so you have to be very smart up
there. Stockton is a smart player. He may not be as fast or as
athletic as the rest of the point guards out there, but he uses his
head, which is the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Utah players use a bit more than their heads. They
also use elbows, knees or whatever other body part seems to do the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of hard for me to believe the first couple of
times (against the Jazz) that they would get away with stuff like
that,'' Francis said. ``But they've been playing that way for
years, and they have the respect from the league, and hopefully one
day I'll be able to get that respect from the league, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is sour grapes, even though two of Francis' worst
games have come against the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   No, Utah seems to relish every opportunity to run a rookie
through the meat grinder it calls an offense. And the overly
physical approach usually works.
</P>
<P>
   It has on Francis, who has averaged just 6.5 points in his two
games against Utah, making five of 18 shots and turning the ball
over 11 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both games that we've played them, I've had terrible games,''
Francis said. ``For me, I think I have to go in there with a
different mindset, that I'm going to play good defense and
neutralize John Stockton _ his passing and his scoring _ and
hopefully we'll get a victory up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets haven't won in Salt Lake City in more than three
years, since they beat the Jazz 75-72 on Nov. 4, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have been blown out twice this season by the Jazz,
losing both games by 16-point margins, something that grates on
Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first game (at Utah), it was our second game of the season,
and I was so excited,'' said Francis, who had just eight points on
3-of-8 shooting in that 98-82 loss. ``In our second game, I
sprained my ankle in the second quarter and couldn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hobbling the whole game (finishing with five points on
2-of-10 shooting in a 103-87 loss on Jan. 8). This time I just want
to go up there and be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since the Rockets will turn the scene of the crime
into the scene of the cram, doing some extra pre-game work to help
everyone recognize and defeat the tedious (yet effective) Utah
offensive sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our shootaround meeting (at Wednesday's practice), and
we're going to have it again (before today's game) because we want
to emphasize that stuff,'' said Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich.
``Early before the game, before the guys come out shooting, our
staff does a great job of talking to them about the particular
problems of that day.''
</P>
<P>
   And those lessons will be tested again tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (Utah's physical play) is kind of hard, and it wears on you
late in the game,'' Francis said. ``But once the fourth quarter
comes around, that's where I think good players get their energy
and just find a way to suck it up and be aggressive.''

   Thomas Coffey, 78, Historian and Author
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Coffey, a biographer and historian, died on Feb. 24 at
his home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his wife, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey's book ``Hap: The Story of the U.S. Air Force and the Man
Who Built It, General Henry `Hap' Arnold'' (1982), was lauded by
the British military historian John Keegan in a review in The
Atlantic. Arnold was chief of the U.S. Army Air Forces from 1942 to
1946.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan said the book ``offers us a major study of the growth of
American air power'' and ``depicts with great frankness an almost
Freudian portrait of a supreme achiever.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffey's book ``Iron Eagle: The Turbulent Life of General Curtis
LeMay'' (1986), was praised by Robert Sherrod, an authority on
World War II, in The New York Times Book Review as ``an interesting
biography of a major military figure'' who was one of the other
great air commanders in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other books written by Coffey were ``Decision Over
Schweinfurt: The U.S. 8th Air Force Battle for Daylight Bombing''
(1977), ``The Long Thirst: Prohibition in America 1920-1933''
(1975) and ``The Donkey's Gift'' (1984), a Christmas fable.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Aberdeen, S.D., Coffey grew up in Madison, Wis.,
studied at the University of Wisconsin and elsewhere and was a
military pilot in the Pacific during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In his early years as a writer he was a critic for the old Los
Angeles Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, no immediate family members survive.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Doguereau, 91, Pianist and Teacher Who Created Foundation
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rene Doguereau, a pianist, an exponent of the French piano
repertory and the founding director of the Peabody-Mason Music
Foundation in Boston, died on March 3 in Mount Holly, N.J. He was
91.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Sept. 8, 1908, in Angers, France, to a family whose
ancestors included a bishop guillotined during the French
Revolution, Doguereau began studying as a young boy with the noted
French pianist Marguerite Long. He was later coached in the works
of Debussy by the composer's widow, Emma Bardac, and studied with
Ravel.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1940s, his teachers included the pianists Paderewski,
Egon Petri and Emil von Sauer. His performing career took him to
major European concert halls. Eventually he settled in the United
States, living and teaching in Boston for more than 60 years.
Doguereau's piano students include Earl Wild, Eugene Indjic, David
Korevaar and Peter Orth.
</P>
<P>
   With the endowment of his friend and patron, Fanny Mason,
Doguereau created the Peabody-Mason Music Foundation, which
presented free concerts in the Boston area. Artists like Glenn
Gould, Maurizio Pollini, Alicia de Larrocha and Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau played in the series, as did emerging performers,
particularly young pianists. Doguereau suspended the foundation in
1985 and transferred its funds (valued at nearly $2 million) to the
Boston Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by an adopted son, Harrison James Wignall, who is
a musicologist and novelist, and a sister, Micheline van Smith of
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   George Siravo, 83, Pop Stars' Arranger &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George Siravo, a pop music arranger who worked with Frank
Sinatra, Doris Day, Tony Bennett and other singers, died Feb. 28 at
his home in Medford, Ore. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime associate of Sinatra's, Siravo orchestrated that
singer's early 1950s albums, ``Sing and Dance With Frank Sinatra''
(Columbia) and (with Nelson Riddle) ``Songs for Young Lovers''
(Capitol).
</P>
<P>
   Born in Staten Island, N.Y., Siravo began his career playing
reeds with the Cliquot Club Eskimos and later worked with the
orchestras of Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller, Charlie Barnet and Jan
Savitt. He wrote his first arrangements for the Miller band. After
working for the radio program ``Your Hit Parade'' in the 1940s he
became a staff arranger and conductor for Columbia Records.
</P>
<P>
   Besides many Sinatra uptempo recordings on Columbia, his credits
include Doris Day's ``It's Magic'' and Tony Bennett's ``Who Can I
Turn To?'' He also recorded several instrumental albums, one of
which, ``Seductive Strings by Siravo,'' featured the trumpeter Doc
Severinsen.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Christine Reddy; a son, Michael;
and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Bill L. Downer, 86, Top Music Publisher &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lewis Downer, a music publisher who worked with many of the
leading jazz and pop singers of the 1940s and '50s, died Feb. 26 at
his home in Los Angeles. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Downer rose to prominence in the 1940s as the head of Decca
Records' music publishing arm, Northern Music, a position he
retained after the company merged with Universal Pictures. A close
friend of many jazz artists, he provided material for Billie
Holiday, Carmen McRae and Louis Jordan, and worked with mainstream
pop singers like Rosemary Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   The songs he published included Victor Young and Edward Heyman's
``When I Fall in Love,'' and the Debbie Reynolds hit ``Tammy,''
written by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. He chose several of Brenda
Lee's early hits, including ``I'm Sorry.''

COWBOYS WAIT FOR DECISION FROM MITCHELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys are continuing the waiting game with
free-agent quarterback Scott Mitchell, who is mulling offers from
Dallas and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have not talked to Mitchell since making him a
contract offer Monday to replace Jason Garrett as Troy Aikman's
primary backup. Mitchell, who would likely have a better chance of
playing next season as a backup in Cincinnati, said he wanted some
time to think about his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals have not spoken to Mitchell in a couple of days,
either. But they believe the quarterback is leaning their way
because his agent asked them to send a contract to Mitchell on
Tuesday. However, a signed contract has not yet been sent back to
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys signed former Arena League quarterback Charles
Puleri to a one-year deal yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   And free-agent tight end Jackie Harris, who played 12 games for
Tennessee last season, was at the Cowboys' training complex
yesterday; the Cowboys are considering signing him to back up David
LaFleur.

RANGERS' KENNY ROGERS PERFECT FOR THREE INNINGS BEFORE TIRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL and T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rangers left-hander Kenny Rogers says he wants to throw his
fastball over the inner half of the plate with consistency this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's performance gave Rogers no reason to alter those
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers retired nine consecutive batters and recorded four
strikeouts through three innings before tiring in the fourth inning
of the Rangers' 8-6, 10-inning victory against the Minnesota Twins
in Fort Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers required only 24 pitches to retire the Twins' first nine
hitters, and he benefited from pitching inside effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``One or two guys had to chase down and away,'' Rogers said.
``If you work inside, it expands the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers surrendered two singles and a walk in the fourth inning
before being removed with two outs and a pitch count of 43.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to hit a wall around 40 or so pitches, and that's
what happened,'' Rogers said. ``You know it's going to happen
sooner or later, and you just try to push it back further the next
time out.'' \Nsubheds:Cuban pitcher interest The Rangers have
expressed preliminary interest in pitcher Adrian ``El Duquecito''
Hernandez, the latest Cuban defector being shopped to major-league
teams. Rangers scouting director Chuck McMichael said he plans to
attend a showcase tryout Tuesday in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``But beyond that, I don't know what our interest is,''
McMichael said. ``Right now, everything is preliminary.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 25, is no relation to the Yankees' Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez, but has a similar knee-jerk delivery that earned
him the nickname ``Little Duque.'' He had a 2.67 earned-run average
for a Cuban team last year and was part of the Cuban all-star team
that faced the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers plunged into the Cuban market last month, signing
second baseman Jorge Diaz and third baseman Osmani Garcia. They
also offered more than $3 million to former Cuban pitcher Danys
Baez before he signed a four-year, $14 million contract with the
Cleveland Indians in November. \Nsubheds:Greer's ankle tested Left
fielder Rusty Greer's inflamed right ankle was tested in the third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Greer had to sprint to catch a shallow fly hit by Torii Hunter.
Greer is playing despite the discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not 100 percent, but he's ready to play,'' said Johnny
Oates, who expects Greer in today's lineup against the Boston Red
Sox. \Nsubheds:Waiting on Diaz The Rangers hope infielder Jorge
Diaz will arrive for camp this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers planned to introduce Diaz at a news conference
today, but visa problems will prevent him from arriving. The
Rangers signed the former member of the Cuban National Team last
monthand invited him to major-league camp as a nonroster player.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz played for Cuba's National Team from 1995-97 before
defecting in August 1998. Diaz moved to the Dominican Republic in
October after stops in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. \Nsubheds:Briefly
Closer John Wetteland (strain, right calf) received treatment but
did not throw. Reliever Mike Venafro (ligament strain, left middle
finger) played catch on flat ground. Pitcher Justin Thompson
(rehabilitation, left shoulder) reported no discomfort after
throwing 43 pitches from a distance of 55 feet. Second baseman
Jason Romano, perhaps the Rangers' best prospect not invited to
major-league camp, was 1-for-1 in Tuesday's minor-league game for
those who reported early. Regular minor-league camps open tomorrow
for pitchers and catchers and Saturday for other position players.
The organization scheduled its Rangers/Arlington Chamber of
Commerce Welcome Home Luncheon for March 31 at the Arlington
Convention Center. Manager Johnny Oates, his staff and members of
the Opening Day roster are scheduled to attend. The event will
include a silent auction and balloon bash for special prizes.
Tickets cost $45, and tables for 10 can be purchased for $450.
Tickets can be purchased by calling (817) 273-5100. Call (817)
273-5187 for more information.

   Before Selection Sunday gets here, it might be a good idea to
check out the high-tech ways to track March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few recommendations for:
</P>
<P>
   Fans who want to be millionaires: Pick a perfect men's
tournament bracket starting on CNNSI.com (hoopschallenge.cnnsi.com)
on Sunday and win $10 million. The catch: You must be perfect
throughout the bracket, which means no misses and no lifelines from
Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   If you really need advice, ask Robert Segreti, a weather
forecaster at Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Okla. Of more than
402,000 entrants in ESPN.com's Men's Tournament Challenge last
year, Segreti did the best, forecasting winners in 46 of 63 games,
including the quarterfinalists and the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Official word: FinalFour.net offers all the official merchandise
and sanitized news, but the coolest section is its wireless
information (www.finalfour.net/2000/wireless). Users can find out
how to set up their digital cellular phones or hand-held computers
to track scores. Fans with cell phones can program their phone's
short message service to receive on-demand scores, tipoff
notification, scoring updates every four minutes, time remaining in
the game and top rebounding and scoring statistics at the end of
the game. For hand-held computers, such as the Palm VII, the site
offers a file to download to enable the device to track scores.
FoxSports.com and ESPN.com also provide updates for digital devices
for scoring updates.
</P>
<P>
   Desk-bound fans: CBS SportsLine benefits from its relationship
with CBS Sports with its March Mayhem
(cbs.sportsline.com/u/madness/2000) site. Its marquee feature is
Tournament LIVE, a multimedia application with real-time stats and
simulated fan sounds from the game. The bad news for
non-basketball-loving office managers bent on productivity: Audio
links to SportsLine Radio can be accessed on Thursdays and Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   People who like to chat with coaches: Talk it up on Sunday on
The National Association of Basketball Coaches' official site
(www.nabc.com). Six coaches are scheduled for Chat Madness on
Sunday. Suggested question: ``What's up with Gene Keady's hair?''
</P>
<P>
   Stats geeks: CNNSI.com is promoting its section called
Statitudes (cnnsi.com/statitudes), which will have instant,
comprehensive statistics on everything from assists leaders to
offbeat stats.
</P>
<P>
   Cool multimedia: MSNBCSports.com users can follow each game via
its TotalCast feature. A popup window offers real-time coverage,
including play-by-play, shooting charts, statistics and photos.
</P>
<P>
   Running the office pool: Tourney Tracker 2000
(www.TourneyTracker2000.com) automates the office pool process with
a paperless bracket ... so no more wasting office supplies. The
tracker computes the contest based on the scoring options entered.
When the Sweet Sixteen is established, the tracker tells the pool
manager who has a chance to win by calculating results for every
possible scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Day-traders: In case the stock market didn't rock your world
enough this week, a San Francisco-based interactive fantasy sports
company features a game with a Wall Street twist. Through Sunday,
SPORTSDAQ.com members can build an online portfolio of tournament
teams and match it against an index of 100 of the hottest
technology stocks for prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Stock brokers: It doesn't include the teams, but ETrade's Market
Madness (etrade.com) has a tournament of 32 stocks divided into
four sectors. Starting March 20, players can earn points by picking
stocks that will perform the best in five progressive rounds. Grand
prize is $100,000.  &LR; subheds:Bytes Sports study: According to a
study released recently by New York-based Jupiter Communications,
consumers are expected to spend approximately $3 billion in
sporting goods, apparel, footwear and event tickets online in 2003.
The study also recommends that media companies focus on current
technology and not go overboard on broadband because less than 5
percent of the U.S. online population has home-based broadband
connections. On conference of TV and Internet, Jupiter found that
more than half of the online audience either sometimes or often
watches TV while online.
</P>
<P>
   New stuff: SportsLine.com is flexing its international muscles
with new sites for sports fans in Germany, Italy and Spain. The
sites focus on six to eight sports for each country, including live

 McCAIN APPEARS READY TO END CAMPAIGN  
 (Eds: Sub to insert 2 new grafs, one just before and one just after
the original 4th graf)  
(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ After a day huddled at his vacation cabin with
family and senior aides, Sen. John McCain appeared ready to end his
maverick candidacy, canceling several days worth of appearances in
Colorado and Illinois and scheduling what his aides called ``a
major announcement'' for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed a day of discussions on his options
that aides had earlier said would focus on how the senator could
force the Republican party to embrace his reform agenda, most
particularly some form of campaign finance overhaul which was at
the center of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire is to make clear in departure _ if that is what it
is _ that he is serious about reform and his voters are serious
about reform,'' said an adviser. ``And the party in order to win
and pick up his voters is going to have to move that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was a day filled with conflicting signs for the McCain
campaign. The senator and his top staff members were separated by
miles from the press corps that normally is constantly at his side.
And many middle- and lower-level staff members were uncertain about
how events were unfolding. The clearest sign came toward the end of
the day when the campaign abruptly canceled campaign events
scheduled for Thursday in Colorado, where Republicans will vote in
a primary Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent supporters said that they had urged McCain to
end his insurgent candidacy within days. But some of his aides were
still defiant on Wednesday morning. Before meeting with the
senator, some of his campaign advisers dropped hints of how
McCain's delegates could disrupt the Republican National Convention
this summer by forcing roll-call votes on his proposals or by
putting McCain's name into nomination, guaranteeing him a prime
speaking platform.
</P>
<P>
   While such battles have been staples of Democratic conventions,
there has not been one at a Republican convention in a generation.
The threat could persuade Bush to move in McCain's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will assess the campaign and the status of the campaign and
the reform movement he so cares about,'' John Weaver, McCain's
political director, said as he headed to McCain's vacation home.
``The options are obvious. Stay in. Get out. Or other options,'' he
added elliptically, referring to a third party bid.
</P>
<P>
   But other advisers said they thought McCain should be taken at
his word that he would be loyal to the party and by Wednesday night
it looked like he was ready to withdraw. Todd Harris, a campaign
spokesman, declined, however, to say what McCain would announce.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain met with his aides, Gov. George W. Bush was clearly
eager on Wednesday to move onto the general election battle against
Vice President Al Gore and indicated that he was prepared to paint
him as a partner in the ethical embarrassments and moral lapses of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up where his victory speech on Tuesday night left off,
Bush said in Austin, Texas, ``If people are happy with Al Gore and
Bill Clinton, the tone they set for America, then you've got a
perfect person to vote for.'' Bush was speaking of Gore, and with
palpable derision.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference in the garden of the Governor's
Mansion, Bush said of his Republican rival that ``John is going to
decide whether he's going to continue on and it's his choice. My
main opponent in this campaign will be Al Gore and our differences
will be stark.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of Bush's supporters in the Senate reached out to McCain's
allies in the hope of healing any rift between the Republican
rivals, enlisting the senator's cooperation for the general
election and uniting the party as best possible.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain signaled in his concession speech Tuesday night that
his wholehearted cooperation with Bush would likely come with a
price when he said, ``Our crusade continues tonight, tomorrow, the
next day, the day after that and for as long as it takes to restore
America's confidence and pride in the practice and institutions of
our great democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of McCain said that Kenneth Duberstein, a former
White House chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan, and Sen.
Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., were relaying word to Bush's allies that the
governor had to take the initial step to heal the breach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that Governor Bush is going to need Senator
McCain, not just for John McCain, but for who and what John McCain
represents,'' Hagel said. ``He represents reform as much as any one
dynamic of who McCain is. John McCain is going to want to have a
voice in helping shape a reform agenda in the Republican Party as
we go into the election in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two of them will have to have a conversation about this
and about campaign finance's priority on a Bush agenda,'' Hagel
said. ``What I'm saying is that a reform agenda will have to be
there for McCain to get enthusiastically engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel emphasized that while he and McCain have talked several
times a day for the past several days, they have not discussed
whether McCain's support for Bush would be conditioned on his
stance toward campaign finance reform.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Bush triumphed over McCain from coast to coast except in
New England on Tuesday, he goes into the general election in a less
commanding position than Gore because he had to turn to the right
to defeat his rival. That has carried a political cost.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's victory in the critical general election state of
California, for example, exit polls showed Bush's win depended on
Republicans. He ran far behind both Gore and McCain among such
critical swing groups as independents and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   A joint front with McCain could help Bush repair some of the
damage and draw to his side the legions of new voters McCain drew
into the primaries. But several aides or advisers to Bush said that
the Texas governor was not offering up specific changes in his
position on overhauling campaign finance regulations simply to
placate McCain.
