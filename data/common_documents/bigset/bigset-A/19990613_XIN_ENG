<HEADLINE> S. African Party Leaders Meet to Evaluate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pan Africanist Congress (PAC)
leadership, including embattled secretary-general Ngila Muendane,
gathered in Kempton Park here Saturday for a two-day post-election meeting
to evaluate its performance in the election.
</P>
<P>
The PAC's dismal election performance saw it returned to Parliament
with only three seats in the National Assembly, down from five in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It retained one seat in the Eastern Cape and gained one more in the
Northern Province, the home of PAC president Stanley Mogoba and the
party's charismatic provincial leader Maxwell Nemadzhivhanani.
</P>
<P>
However, in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng, the PAC lost its seats in
both legislatures.
</P>
<P>
Mogoba's aide Mtura Mama said Saturday night that members of the
party's national executive committee were looking at whether to take
responsibility for the party's unsatisfactory performance as a whole,
or whether to apportion blame to particular individuals.
</P>
<P>
"They are analyzing everything, each and every bit of data. They
are assessing reasons why we have performed this way."
</P>
<P>
Mogoba indicated last week that he and the leadership were morally
bound to reconsider their positions and he has offered to retire at the
party's December congress, should this be necessary.
</P>
<P>
Mama said the two-day NEC investigation was a "preliminary
assessment".
</P>
<P>
A national workshop would be held where branches would have to
account to the NEC about their performance.
</P>
<P>
The workshop would involve the provincial, regional and branch
leadership and only then would a final assessment be made.
</P>
<P>
On news reports that Muendane was to be disciplined at the NEC
meeting, Mama said: "Muendane is not an issue. We are concentrating on
the party's performance."
</P>
<P>
Mama said there were no official moves to discipline Muendane so
far.
</P>
<P>
"We are still concentrating on the party, not individuals," Mama
said.

<P>
Director General of the Southern Refineries Company Abdul
Wahab Ahmed said his company signed 80 contracts valued at 25
million U.S. dollars to purchase equipment and spare parts, but it
has only received 4 percent of contracted spare parts due to the

<HEADLINE> New Twist in S. Africa's Western Cape Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- As a new twist in politics in
South Africa's Western Cape, the African Christian Democratic Party
(ACDP) withdrew Saturday evening from a coalition with the New
National Party (NNP) and the Democratic Party (DP).
</P>
<P>
ACDP leader Kenneth Meshoe said his party was formally withdrawing
from the multi-party government to reserve a neutral position for
future discussions.
</P>
<P>
"It needs to be made clear that we are not in negotiation with any
particular party or responding to pressure from any party concerned,"
Meshoe said.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the ACDP does not change the balance of power in
the province. In the June 2 elections, the ANC won 18 of the 42 seats
in the provincial legislature. The NNP and DP together have 22 seats.
</P>
<P>
The ANC believes that it represents the majority of the voters in
the province and the provincial government must reflect this.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday, Western Cape ANC leader Ebrahim Rasool said
the negotiations on a possible coalition government for the province
could not be held hostage to the "unstated ambitions and aspirations"
of opposition parties at national and other provincial levels.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that talks aimed at forming an inclusive
government in the best interests of the Western Cape are deadlocked,"
he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Rasool said the NNP, DP and ACDP's insistence that a representative
and inclusive government in the Western Cape be applicable to all
provinces and the national government was the main reason for the
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"Such a demand can only be designed to scuttle the talks re-opened
after sustained public pressure in the province. The ANC in the
Western Cape is not in a position to meet this demand," Rasool said.
</P>
<P>
The NNP, the DP and the ACDP met the ANC leadership in the province
Friday night to discuss conditions under which the ANC could possibly
be brought into the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks at a city hotel ended after about four hours
without reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The DP's Western Cape provincial council on Saturday morning
unanimously gave its provincial leader Hennie Bester a mandate to
continue negotiations on multi-party government for the province.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the remaining alliance partners and the ANC are
expected to resume later on Saturday or on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement on Saturday evening, Bester and NNP provincial
leader Gerald Morkel said they had noted with regret the withdrawal of
the ACDP, but believed this would not affect the majority of the
multi-party government which remained intact.
</P>
<P>
They didn't agree that the talks with the ANC were deadlocked.
However, they still stood by their demand of coalition governments in
the other eight provinces and at the national level.

<HEADLINE> Depositors of Closed Ugandan Bank to Be Paid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda, the country's
central bank, has completed its arrangements and will begin to
pay the depositors of the closed Greenland Bank Limited next week.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Saturday by the central bank said the work
of payment would begin on June 18.
</P>
<P>
The bank has lent the Depositors Protection Fund enough money
to enable it to meet the payments to all the ensured depositors
of the ill-fortune bank.
</P>
<P>
The stake-holders, directors responsible for the mismanagement
of the closed bank will not benefit from this plan of the central
bank. The exact amount to be paid each day would be published, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement further noted that depositors of commercial
banks closed later on would not be paid by the central bank. They
would risk the loss of their money if their money was deposited
in a mismanaged bank.
</P>
<P>
The Greenland Bank was closed on April 1 for mismanagement and
huge insider lending. It has about 150,000 depositors. Following
its closure, President Yoweri Museveni and senior officials
promised to repay the depositors in full.
</P>
<P>
A total of five commercial banks have been closed in the
country since last year, which has very much dented public
confidence in the banking sector.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Algerian Presidents Meet to Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The meeting between presidents of
Egypt and Algeria on Saturday has laid the foundation for further
development of the bilateral ties, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting in Algiers, Algeria, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika
discussed ways of activating the agreements signed between the two
countries, Moussa told Egypt's Middle East News Agency after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak traveled to Algiers earlier in the day for a brief
visit. Moussa was accompanying the president in the trip.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also dealt with the possibility of raising
the level of the joint committee between the two countries to
better serve the bilateral cooperation, Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Bouteflika assured Mubarak of Algeria's support for
Egypt's efforts to join the Arab Maghreb Union as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Egypt submitted the application in 1994 to the union, which
groups Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Moussa disclosed the talks between Mubarak and Bouteflika also
covered the West Sahara issue, over which Algeria and Morocco have
long been at odds.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika expressed hope that a solution would be reached to
the issue and voiced desire to have good and positive relations
with Morocco, the Egyptian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Algeria was opposed to Morocco's occupation of West Sahara's
northern part following Spain's withdrawal in 1975. It recognized
the Arab Sahara Democratic Republic founded by the local West
Sahara People's Liberation Front in 1976, a move which prompted
Morocco to sever diplomatic ties with Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak mediated between the two sides in 1977 when he was
Egypt's deputy president.
</P>
<P>
After his short visit in Algiers, Mubarak has flown into Rabat
to lead a delegation to the third session of the Egyptian-Moroccan
Higher Committee.

MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia's General Staff has begun
drafting plans for a large-scale strategic staff exercise on
instructions from the top political leadership, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will involve three military districts and one of
the Russian fleets, as well as Belarus' armed forces, Tass said,
quoting an official with the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The official said some structures of the General Staff,
including the Main Operations Directorate, will be working at full
throttle to fulfill the tasks assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
He did not say when the order was received to begin
preparations for the exercise and whether it was in connection
with the situation in Yugoslavia, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Russian paratroopers are stationed in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo now, but talks between Russia and the United
States on Moscow's peacekeeping role there were stalled.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been pressing for its own sector in Kosovo and being
under its own command, while NATO says the peacekeeping operation
must be under a unified command and control system.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-U.S. talks in Moscow, on and off for several days,
are expected to resume Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Holds Arab Debut in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 12 (Xinhua) -- World-renowned tenor Luciano
Pavarotti Saturday night gave his first performance in the Middle
East for thousands of Lebanese and Arab audience in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Italian soprano Camela Remigio and the
64-member Budapest Concert Orchestra, the Italian tenor sang a
personal selection of arias, most of them being works by Italian
maestro Giacomo Puccini.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour concert, which was held at the open-air Sport City
stadium, was organized by Lebanese privately-owned Murr Television
and the Beirut Festival Organization.
</P>
<P>
More than 16,000 tickets, including 2,000 VIP tickets priced
at 450,000 Lebanese pounds (about 300 U.S. dollars), have been
sold since February.
</P>
<P>
Three planes were chartered from Cyprus and more than
3,000 fans from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Kuwait booked the flights to Beirut to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said that they would make 400,000 dollars from
ticket sales and that any profits, excluding 1.2 million dollars
paid to Pavarotti, will go to charity groups in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
So far, two of the three greatest tenors in the world, namely
Pavarotti and Jose Carreras, have given performances in Beirut, a city
which has been named the cultural capital of the Arab world this
year by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The other greatest tenor, Placido Domingo, will sing at the
Beiteddine Festival, which is scheduled to be held in July this
year in the presidential summer palace in south of Beirut.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states gathered in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia on Saturday to discuss regional issues topped by the
current GCC-Iranian rapprochement and its possible impact.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was preceded by bilateral talks among the chief
diplomats of the six GCC members -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the Unite Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The preparatory discussions focused on the GCC-Iranian
rapprochement and its impact on the dispute between the UAE
and Iran over the three Gulf islands of Abu Moussa, Greater
and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The UAE recently expressed its dismay over the warming up of
ties between some GCC states and Iran, saying that might
relinquish GCC's support to Abu Dhabi in the dispute over the
three islands, which are controlled by Iran but claimed by both
countries.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech at Saturday's gathering, UAE Foreign
Minister Rashid Abdullah al-Nuaimi criticized Iran for not
cooperating with the UAE in its efforts to solve the dispute over
the islands.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our repeated call for a peaceful solution through
negotiations or by referring the dispute to the international
court of justice, Iran is continuing its false claims to the
islands," Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed his country is keen on solving disputes through
peaceful means so that it "can move to an advanced stage of
bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, during their one-day meeting, will
also review the situation in Iraq, the Kuwait News Agency

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will hold an
international trade fair from July 2 to 10, according to the
Board of External Trade (BET), the organizer.
</P>
<P>
So far, businessmen from 28 foreign countries have confirmed
participation in the annual event, which is to take place on the
Saba Saba grounds in Dar es Salaam, BET said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
BET's senior trade information officer, Emmanuel Buliki, told
reporters that 30,000 square meters of interior rentable space of
the Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF) is fully
booked.
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to this year's DITF, the 23rd of its kind, include
Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Egypt, Lebanon, Malaysia and Russia,
Buliki said, adding that the last two will be represented by
individual companies.
</P>
<P>
The DITF has established itself over the years as the window
for Tanzanian products as well as goods of east, central and
southern African region. It is supported by the Dar es Salaam
harbor which serves the region efficiently.
</P>
<P>
The fair acts as one stop center for reaching countries such
as Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Participation in the fair has ever been on the increase from
a little more than 100 companies in late 1980s to over 1,000 firms in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 1,021 exhibitors attended the fair, 234
of which came from overseas, representing 24 countries. Twelve
foreign nations participated at the official level.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Company Slams U.S., Britain for Blocking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Southern Refineries
Company on Saturday slamed the U.S. and British representatives in
the U.N. Sanctions Committee for blocking the approval of the
contracts his company concluded with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Southern Refineries Company Abdul
Wahab Ahmed said his company signed 80 contracts valued at 25
million U.S. dollars to purchase equipment and spare parts, but it
has only received 4 percent of contracted spare parts due to
the U.S. and British representatives' blocking.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said the contracted items include steam towers and other
spare parts for limiting ecological pollution and treating
industrial water.
</P>
<P>
He added all those equipment and spare parts were signed under
the oil-for-food program whose fourth and fifth phases allowed
Iraq to import 300 million dollars worth of spare parts in each
phase to upgrade its oil installations.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said his company is in dire need for those equipment and
spare parts to increase production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Some U.N. oil experts are now in Iraq to assess the country's
need for equipment and spare parts in the sixth phase of the
oil-for-food deal which came into effect on May 25, and allows
Iraq to export 5.2 billion dollars of oil in six months.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has requested that 600 million dollars be allocated in
the current phase for the purchase of badly-needed equipment and
spare parts for its oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is planning to increase its oil production to
pre-sanctions level of 3.25 million barrels per day (bpd) by the
end of this year from the current production level of 2.5 million
bpd to meet the requirement of the oil-for-food deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police are investigating the
Friday evening murder of three Makerere University students by a
gunman and have vowed to track down the criminal.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is being done to establish the identity, motive and
whereabouts of the killer and effect their subsequent arrest and
prosecution," police deputy spokesman Eric Naigambi said Saturday
evening, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Namanya, regional police commander of Kampala extra, was
quoted as saying that police are busy piecing up information in
order to get the assailant.
</P>
<P>
He said the general situation in the capital city was not out of
control, but it required more input from both the security agencies
and the public.
</P>
<P>
He advised members of the public to maximize the services of
backup forces such as local defense units, home guards, local
councils and the civil society.
</P>
<P>
The police could not succeed with the cooperation from the
public. So while the police are at the forefront, the public should
be vigilant and provide them with information, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the university students, who organized demonstrations
Saturday morning, are preparing to keep a vigil for the dead
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
They are reported to be collecting firewood for the vigil on the
Freedom Square at the compound.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, university authorities appealed to the students to
keep calm while the investigations are still under way.
</P>
<P>
Three final-year students of Makerere University were shot dead
at close range near the gate of the university at about 10:30 p.m.
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified assailant, who reportedly followed the students in
a vehicle, shot them when they were getting out of a taxi less than
100 meters away from a police station.
</P>
<P>
Many students blamed this incident on the laxity of the police
and demanded that security be strengthened within the campus.
</P>
<P>
Makerere University, the most famous university in Uganda and one
of the best in Africa, is a fenceless university. Taxi buses can go
through the campus at any time.

<HEADLINE> Kurds in Cyprus Urge U.N. Chief to Intervene in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- About 100 people gathered in
central Nicosia on Saturday to call on U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to intervene in the trial of Abdullah Ocalan, captive
leader of Kurdish rebels in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The people, mainly Kurds residing in Cyprus, urged the U.N. and
other international organizations to exert pressure on Turkey to
try Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
in accordance with international legal norms.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Ankara Security Court No. 2 on May 31 started the
trial of Ocalan on charges of treason. He could face the death
penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. chief, the Kurds said Turkey is faced
with a big opportunity to solve the Kurdish problem in the country
through the trial of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
If the PKK leader is executed, Turkey will be turned into
"hell," the letter warned.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 15-year-old war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over
37,000 lives since August 1984.

The rebel leader pleaded for his life in the trial, saying he

<HEADLINE> Russia-US Moscow Talks Stalled, May Resume Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Talks here between Russia and the
United States on Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo again became
deadlocked Saturday as Moscow accuses the U.S. side of taking "a
sticky unproductive position."
</P>
<P>
One Russian negotiator said U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott "heed none of the plans, offered by the Russian
delegation to deploy Russian peace-keepers in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"In the atmosphere of the talks itself, neglect is felt for the
interests of Russia, which by its actions has won the right for
presence in Kosovo. The impression is that the American side is
trying to usurp the right to its own exclusive presence in the
region, leaving a secondary role for Russia," the Interfax news
agency quoted the unidentified negotiator as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
said Saturday's round of talks between Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and Talbott, which lasted for an hour and a half and
was "business-like, aiming at concrete results," are likely to
resume Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The talks followed the entry into Kosovo by some 200 Russian
troops in the early hours of Saturday, a move Ivanov said was an
unfortunate mistake and that orders had been given for them to
pull out.
</P>
<P>
But as the day wore on, it became clear that it was Yeltsin who
had issued the order to move into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the advance unit of a Russian peace-keeping
contingent is part of the first phase of the international
presence on security in Kosovo. Necessary presidential directives
in regard to such presence are available, the Interfax news agency
quoted Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Sergei Prikhodko as saying.
</P>
<P>
In stead of withdrawing from Kosovo, there are reports that
Moscow may airlift more of its peacekeeping troops into the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Quoting military and diplomatic sources in Moscow, Interfax
said Russia will apparently expand its military presence in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that an additional contingent of several
hundred servicemen is planned to be airlifted to Pristina, the
Kosovo capital where about 200 paratroopers are now stationed.
</P>
<P>
Ready for the airlift are units from the rapid reaction forces,
based at Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Pskov. Each of the three air force
bases has prepared three Il-76 transport planes for the flight,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The planes with personnel and hardware are expected to fly
through the air space provided by Ukraine and Bulgaria. Hungary
has denied access to its air space, citing its commitments to
NATO's leadership.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Only One Superpower Can't Secure World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
said Saturday that the existence of only one superpower in the
world now constituted a factor of instability.
</P>
<P>
In his statements to the semi-official Athens News Agency
(ANA), Simitis said that through the Greek government's handling,
the country did not only avoid a dangerous entanglement in the
crisis in Yugoslavia, but also laid the basis for an upgraded role
in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Greece remained reliable partners and reliable interlocutors of
all countries in the region, he said, adding that the country was
in the process of completing phase of economic and social
development with most visible results.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the Yugoslav crisis, Greece, which regards
itself as a major factor of peace and stability in the region, had
voiced its opposition to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and had
worked hard with other countries on the diplomatic front to find a
political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
While stating that the crisis in Yugoslavia had proved that
only one superpower could not secure global stability and security
since its unilateral actions alone amounted to an imbalance,
Simitis said in May that Greece wanted a stronger Europe, which
could be equal with the United States in the future.

<HEADLINE> Bush Starts Presidential Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Texas Governor George W.
Bush kicked off his 2000 presidential election campaign Saturday
by travelling to Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who leads in presidential polling despite not spending a
single day on the campaign trail, arrived in Iowa for a four-day
trip to the two presidential proving states by his aptly named
"Great Expectations" campaign plane.
</P>
<P>
The Texas Governor will deliver his first major speech of his
2000 Republican bid Saturday in Iowa. He will then travel to New
Hampshire Monday after a stop in Maine Sunday.
</P>
<P>
His speech traced the broad themes of the campaign without
offering specific policies, according to Bush's advisers.
</P>
<P>
Bush argued that Republicans can be conservative -- cut
taxes, trim welfare rolls, reduce crime, improve schools, demand
and promote personal responsibility -- without being mean about
it.
</P>
<P>
He vowed not to retreat from criticism, saying he has chosen
the ground of "compassionate conservatism" and will not waver
from that spot.
</P>
<P>
Bush, 52, has become the presidential front-runner of the
Republican Party, but observers said the son of former President
George Bush is not well-known outside Texas as his success is due
in part to his name. He has yet to prove himself as a national
candidate in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
His critics say Bush is poll-driven, ideologically shallow
and a natural-born waffler. Bush fostered the criticism by
giving vague or conflicting opinions on national issues while
overseeing the state's legislative session this year.

<P>
KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has emphasized the importance of zoning areas in accordance with
the crops to be cultivated in order to have organized agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the call when addressing a public rally in the
central district of Kiboga Saturday afternoon, according to a press
release issued by the President's Office Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said the zoning is important because it makes marketing of
the produce easy.
</P>
<P>
The government and the population have clearly defined tasks and
responsibilities in the fight against poverty, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Although many development programs have been undertaken in Luwero
Triangle, they were not focused in a way to ensure meaningful
development, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Museveni has, on many occasions, encouraged farmers to develop
agricultural programs and to increase their homestead incomes by
careful and scientific farming.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, the mainstay of Uganda's economy, contributes 42
percent to the country's gross domestic product at present and it
has been one of the few priorities for development on the
government's agenda.

<HEADLINE> Greedy Pharmacists Blasted in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia accused Saturday some greedy pharmacists
of contributing to the declining standards in the pharmacy industry and the
provision of unqualified health care to society.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Information Minister Fidelis Mando said here that the
enjoyment of highest level of health as a fundamental human right has been
tramped upon partly by lack of professionalism among Pharmaceutical Society
of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He accused some pharmacists of running drug stores with
scheduled drugs and those manufactured using expired materials,
thereby threatening the health of people.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister appealed to pharmacists in the country
to add value to health care by being committed to professional
ethics.
</P>
<P>
Complete reliance on pharmacy as a vocation not as job will herald the
beginning of sanity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Continued pharmaceutical education must be compulsory for all practising
pharmacists in order to promote professionalism in the industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said while there is an acute shortage of qualified
pharmaceutical manpower in the country, pharmacists must transform themselves
from being dispensers to consultants.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, David Phiri, president of the
Pharmaceutical Society of Zambia complained that there is
no school in the country to offer degree programs for pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to set up a training school for pharmacists as
soon as possible.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma has called for Moslems in the country to foster
cooperation with other religious believers to sustain the
existing peace and tranq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a crowd of Moslems in western Tabora Region Friday,
Juma, a Moslem, said Moslems should avoid religious clashes and
use wisdom in solving such problems in case they arise, a
report reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said Moslems have noble tasks to cooperate with other
religious denominations in fighting vices in the society,
including drug abuse and robbery.
</P>
<P>
To take proper care of children and teach them to be
responsible citizens is an important measure in averting them
from engaging in vices in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president stressed that religious teaching should target
at fostering cooperation among people of different religions and not
to incite clashes by bullying each other.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Tanzanians to do away with superstitious beliefs
and practices that are harmful to people, citing witch-hunting
that leads to the killing of old people in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Juma challenged Moslems and other religious denominations to
give equal education opportunities to girls, saying they are
playing an increasingly important role in economic development.

<HEADLINE> 100 Countries to Seek Faster Phase-out of CFC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from over 100
countries will meet in Geneva in mid June to discuss how
to implement effectively the Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer and how to fund national efforts to
eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The 19th meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group will be held
between June 15 and 18 when the concern arises sharply that global
warming may already be making ozone depletion worse than previously
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse gases trap heat in the lower troposphere near the
Earth's surface, which means less heat can escape upwards into
the ozone layer. The resulting lower temperatures have the
potential to accelerate the chemical processes that destroy
ozone.
</P>
<P>
"These scientific findings add new urgency to the world-wide
elimination of CFCs and halons," said Klaus Toepfer, executive
director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), which
will sponsor the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Colder stratospheric temperatures over the Arctic threaten to
accelerate the thinning of the protective ozone shield over
Northern Europe, creating an ozone `hole' similar to the one that
already appears each spring over the Antarctic," he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, developing countries are to
cut back their CFC and halon emissions rapidly to 50 percent by
the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals
almost completely in 1996, although Russia and several others
have experienced delays in meeting their deadlines.
</P>
<P>
China is now allegedly the world's largest producer of CFCs
and halons. The Protocol's Multilateral Fund has allocated money
to help China close down its production facilities for these
chemicals over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Fund is now negotiating with India, which has the second
largest production capacity of all developing countries, to
develop a funding program for closing down facilities there.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
Saturday accused foreign forces of destroying African unity and
blamed the political turmoil on the continent on them.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Africa will come out triumphant finally.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while meeting his Zambian counterpart
Frederick Chiluba here.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader arrived here Saturday afternoon for talks
with Chiluba to make final touches on a cease-fire agreement in
the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi praised Chiluba, who has been mandated by the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) to mediate a peaceful
settlement of the nearly one year conflict in the vast central
African country, for his spearheading peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said a proposed cease-fire agreement to be signed by the
warring parties involved in the war is a manifestation of
Chiluba's efforts to bring peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Africa appreciates the support given by
Libya to the independence struggle of many African countries and
the support it is giving to resolve conflicts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday, Chiluba said only the Congolese people can
resolve their problems. The international community can only
provide assistance.
</P>
<P>
A long-awaited regional summit will be held here on June 25 in
which the cease-fire agreement will be signed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Ready to Work with Russia in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Saturday that the United States looked forward to working
with Russia as a peacekeeping force in Kosovo despite Russia's
opposition against NATO's bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a commencement speech at the University of Chicago,
Clinton said while the Russians may not have agreed with NATO's
air campaign against Yugoslavia, they "do agree with the
proposition that all the people of that tiny land (Kosovo) - Serb
and Albanian alike - should be able to live in peace and dignity."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Clinton was scheduled to speak with Russian
president Boris Yeltsin by telephone to discuss the confusion over
the deployment of Russian troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, about 200 Russian soldiers in trucks and
personnel carriers entered the Kosovo capital of Pristina hours
before NATO troops crossed into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The deployment, which took place before the role of the Russian
troops had been worked out, took the United States and its NATO
allies by surprise.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen called the situation confusing
but ultimately hopeful _ a sign that Russians are eager to help
out and an opportunity for NATO and Russia to reprise a successful
joint peacekeeping operation next door in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"It certainly was precipitous action leading to some
confusion," Cohen told a Pentagon briefing, but adding the
wrinkles will be quickly smoothed.
</P>
<P>
"There's no particular glory in arriving in Pristina with 200
troops. To say that 'we're here first,' that's not the essence of
what this peacekeeping mission is all about. We would like for
them to participate and whether they arrive a few hours earlier or
later really is not a significant factor," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops have already met with NATO troops who have
also arrived at the Pristina airport, Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"They want to play a part in the peacekeeping role. Whether or
not it was a result of confusion as far as the command was
concerned, that remains to be determined," he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also reiterated that that if Russian troops want
to serve as peacekeepers, they must agree to operate under a
unified command structure and the Russians can't have their own
sector of territory to guard, as Moscow has called for.
</P>
<P>
Washington insisted that Kosovo be divided into five sectors
run by the U.S., Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Texas Governor George W.
Bush vowed Saturday to become the next president in his first
major speech in the 2000 presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I'm running for the presidency of the United States," Bush
said, making his intentions more clear than ever. "There's no
turning back and I intend to be the next president."
</P>
<P>
Bush, who delivered the speech at a country barbecue in Iowa,
tried to introduce his "compassionate conservative" politics to
the audience and about 200 reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud to be a compassionate conservative," said Bush, son
of former President George bush, "and on this ground I will make
my stand.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who arrived Saturday in Iowa to begin his first campaign
trip, promised to end "this season of cynicism" in American
politics.
</P>
<P>
Republicans can be conservative without being mean about it,
he said, offering to cut taxes and welfare rolls and retain
local control of schools.
</P>
<P>
His top goals include "drawing a moral line" and encouraging
personal responsibility from Americans, getting faith-based
organizations such as churches involved in easing social problems
and improving schools so that "no child will be left behind".
</P>
<P>
Bush, 52, has become Republican presidential front-runner by
leading in polls, money-raising and endorsements in the party.
</P>
<P>
Polls show Bush with a wide lead over his Republican foes,
though pollsters say the Texas governor benefits from people
confusing the younger and old Bush.
</P>
<P>
Other Republican presidential hopefuls, including former
President of U.S. Red Cross Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee
Governor Lamar Alexander and Representative of Ohio John Kasich
also took their presidential campaigns to Iowa Saturday, refusing
to cede to Bush.

BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua)-- Li Peng, a standing committee
member of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Political
Bureau, attended an evening performance presented by an art troupe

He said that China and the DPRK are close neighbors which

Cultural exchanges between the two countries have been fruitful
and have expanded in recent years, said Li. He added that the
cultural exchange program has progressed smoothly, along with
increased reciprocal visits between government cultural
delegations and performing troupes.
</P>
<P>
Li cited the great success of the visiting Pibada Opera Troupe
and said that the troupe's three previous tours to China have left
a profound and lasting impression on Chinese audiences.
</P>
<P>
The troupe was founded in 1971 and has produced numerous operas
with wide-spread audience appeal in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
This evening's audience exhibited their delight with resounding
applauses for the songs and dances from both countries presented
by the DPRK artists.
</P>
<P>
The troupe is here to participate in the '99 International
National Song and Dance Year at the invitation of the Chinese
Ministry of Culture. The artists are scheduled to tour Shanghai

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-based Citibank has
officially initiated Chinese currency services in south China's
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone bordering on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Six foreign banks in Shenzhen currently offer yuan-related
services, according to a local bank official.
</P>
<P>
Citibank established operations in China some 100 years ago.
The bank opened its first operation in east China in 1902 and
thereafter opened seven branches in Guangzhou and other cities in
China prior to suspending operations during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Citibank reopened a representative office in Shenzhen in 1983,
with the office reclassified as a branch in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Citibank is one of only few foreign banks granted approval to
offer Chinese currency services in Shanghai and Shenzhen, the only
two Chinese cities open to foreign banks.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief, Yemeni PM to Discuss Arab Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid will hold talks with Yemeni Prime
Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani Thursday on Arab issues and the
Middle East peace process, said an AL spokesman Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Iryani is scheduled to arrive in Cairo on Thursday, leading
a delegation to the annual meeting of the Yemeni-Egyptian Higher
Committee in a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
AL spokesman Talaat Hammad told reporters that Abdel-Meguid and
al-Iryani will discuss the inter-Arab ties, means of restoring
Arab solidarity in the light of the normalization of relations
between Yemen and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Yemen reopened its embassy in Kuwait last month, winding up the
tense relations between the two countries since the 1990-1991 Gulf
crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Yemen condemned the invasion, but it refused to join the
U.N.-sanctioned coalition in driving Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in
February 1991. Kuwait accused Sanaa of siding with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid and al-Iryani will seek ways of promoting
coordination among Arab countries concerned in the Mideast peace
process, Hammad said.
</P>
<P>
They will also study the situation in Somalia in light of the
good offices of Yemen and the pan-Arab forum to achieve national
reconciliation in the African country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yemen has been playing a role in helping end the war among
Somalia's factions and seeking ways of promoting the country's
national reconciliation. Yemen has received thousands of Somali
refugees fleeing the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League suspended Somalia's membership after the
outbreak of the country's civil war in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Albright Plays Down Russian Presence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Sunday played down the importance of Russia'
s surprise movement of troops into Kosovo but stood firm on NATO's
demand for command of any Russian force there.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the National Broadcasting Company NBC),
Albright said that the unified command of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) is crucial.
</P>
<P>
"They (Russian troops) want to be part of the KFOR (Kosovo
Security Force) force. We want them to be part of it. I think they
got a little bit ahead of themselves," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 to 15,000 allied forces were moving into Kosovo,
Albright said, adding, "The Russian component is about 200, so I
think we don't want to overestimate all of this."
</P>
<P>
When asked if the Russian troops could be given a sector in
Kosovo, Albright said: "No, they could not have their own sector,
because one of the things we want to avoid and will avoid is a
partition of Kosovo, and that would contribute to it."

<HEADLINE> Education Ministry to Popularize PETS Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education today
announced that it will popularize Public English Test System (PETS)
nationwide from September this year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the National Education Examinations Authority
(NEEA) under the Education Ministry said that the five-level test
system will cover all standards of English required of a student
completing junior three in middle schools in China to an English
major after two years of study.
</P>
<P>
The PETS, a cooperative project in the educational sector
between the Chinese and British governments, is a national English
proficiency test system designed and administrated by the NEEA.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Education Zhou Yuanqing said that almost every
item of education exams in China has English tests, but these
tests overlap and are independent from each other, which bring
much inconvenience to English teaching and testing.
</P>
<P>
"To bring about a change, the Ministry of Education determines
to establish PETS. It will also exert a positive influence upon
the establishment and improvement of the system of certificates,"
said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
PETS does not have any specifications about the age, occupation
and education for examinees and anyone is permitted to take the
tests.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that PETS aims to examine the abilities
of listening, speaking, reading and writing of the examinees, with
stress on listening and speaking abilities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PETS level 3 will replace the public English
test for self-taught learners and the English test in the Higher
Education Degree Validation Tests for the local-people-run higher
schools, and the PETS level 5 will replace the English level tests
for those candidates seeking government sponsorship for overseas
academic development.
</P>
<P>
PETS will be experimented in some cities and provinces
including Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Liaoning and Zhejiang this
year, and will be popularized in China from next year, said the
official.

<HEADLINE> Hungary's International Payment Deficit Rises Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's international payment
deficit rose dramatically in the first four months of this year
due to a slump in the country's exports, according to the latest
figures released by the National Bank.
</P>
<P>
The country registered 763 million U.S. dollars of
international payment deficit in the first four months of 1999, 71
percent higher than the same period last year, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Its trade deficit reached 1.1 billion dollars in the period, a
40 percent increase from a year ago, with the deficit for April
hitting 439 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the bank cited shrinking exports and foreign
investments as the main causes for the surge of the country's
international payment deficit.
</P>
<P>
From January to April in 1999, exports only grew by 5.4 percent,
with its sales to the former Soviet republics felling 60 percent.
As a result of NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, Hungary's trade with
the Balkan country nearly ceased.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hungary attracted only 313 million dollars of
foreign investments, a 50 percent decrease from the previous year'
s level. Economic experts here believe that it is hardly for the
country to gain 1.5 billion dollars of foreign investment as
projected earlier.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's New Budget to Trim Fiscal Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government plans
to reduce fiscal deficit to 3.3 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) in the 1999-2000 financial year (July 1-June 30) by
broadening the tax base and mobilizing domestic resources.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Sunday, Finance Minister
Ishaq Dar said overall fiscal deficit in the coming financial year
is projected at 112.7 billion rupees (2.2 billion U.S. dollars),
which will be 3.3 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit is planned to be financed through net
external assistance of 59.3 billion rupees (1.14 billion dollars)
and non-bank borrowing of 67.1 billion rupees (1.3 billion
dollars), said Dar.
</P>
<P>
Dar presented the federal budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal year
at the National Assembly Saturday. The new budget has forecast a
5-percent GDP growth rate against the 3.1-percent growth achieved
in the outgoing fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Abolition of discretionary powers, transparency and
simplification of the tax system in the new budget will help prop
up tax culture and revenue collection during the next fiscal year,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
New taxation measures envisaged in the budget will have a
financial impact of 17 billion rupees (329 million dollars), Dar
said.
</P>
<P>
New budgetary proposals are aimed at doing away with
duplication of taxes, providing incentives to revenue generation,
ensuring financial stability and accelerating economic development
pace, he added.
</P>
<P>
Various concrete measures have been initiated in the new budget
to wipe out tax anomalies and provide tax relief which, he hoped,
would motivate revenue generation.
</P>
<P>
Dar also said the defense allocation indicated an increase of
14 billion rupees (270 million dollars) or 10.9 percent against
the revised estimates of the 1998-99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
If need arose, "the government will not shy away from any extra
increase in defense budget as the country's sovereignty was
supreme," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian companies have reached with those of other
African countries 100 million U.S. dollars worth of deals, the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The deals were sealed during a trade fair attended by members
of the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) on
the sidelines of a recent summit of the group in Nairobi, Kenya,
Moustafa Sayed, chief of Egypt's Trade Point, said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The deals included 18 million dollars for investment
activities, 13 million dollars in trade and 65 million dollars in
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's participation in the fair is expected to help open new
horizons for its products in the African market, he added.
</P>
<P>
GAZA -- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is estimated
to lose approximately 600 million U.S. dollars a year due to its
dependence on the Israeli currency, the shekel.
</P>
<P>
The figure was enclosed in a study report by the economic
department in the Palestinian president's office.
</P>
<P>
The report deems it necessary to maintain the Jordanian dinar
on the grounds that over one half of the present Palestinian
banking system is based on Jordanian banks and capital.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA)
has agreed to send about 100 Japanese experts to Saudi Arabia to
work as advisers at various Saudi government departments.
</P>
<P>
And it will train 120 Saudi officials in Japan who will also
undertake field studies and make exploratory tours, the Arabic
daily Al Hayat reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in meteorology and environmental protection will
stand as the top priority for the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a consultative team of eight Japanese experts on
naval environment will undertake the implementation of the second
phase of a study, jointly conducted with the Saudi authorities in
the eastern zone, to control water pollution in the Gulf area.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese agency plans to send an advisor on air pollution
to work with the main offices of the Meteorological and
Environment Protection Department in Jedda.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Trade volume between Tunisia and Egypt will reach 300
million U.S. dollars by the end of the year 2000, said Tunisian
Minister of International Cooperation and Foreign Investment
Mohamed Ghannouchi.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian exports to Egypt include ceramics, car spare parts and
olive oil. And imports from Egypt include cotton, textiles,
ready-to-wear clothes and shoes.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will officially apply for membership to the East
and South Africa Bank of Trade and Development at the Burundi
meeting scheduled for Wednesday, the Al Ahram daily reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bank has 15 member states plus the African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is considered as the financial arm of the economic
integration arrangements of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA). So far, the bank has invested about 700
million dollars in COMESA member states. Egypt has recently joined
the COMESA.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Earn US$1 Billion From EPZs Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will be able to earn 1
billion U.S. dollars annually from its two export processing zones
(EPZs) which will generate job opportunities for some 120,000
people.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at the 17th meeting of the Board of Governors
of the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The export earnings from the Dhaka EPZ and the Chittagong EPZ
in southeastern Bangladesh from July 1998 to May 1999, the first
11 months of the current fiscal year, stood at 632 million
dollars, which was 11 percent higher than those of the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, 132 industrial units are engaged in production
in the two EPZs while 101 others are being set up.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the two EPZs, which have employed more than
81,000 people, has so far this fiscal year reached 391 million
dollars against 71 million dollars during the corresponding period
of last fiscal year, and fresh investment in the EPZs in the next
two years will be 600 million dollars for 200 new enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Three more EPZs will be built respectively in Mongla, the
country's second largest seaport, and in the northwestern Ishwardi
and southeastern Comilla districts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
instructed the authorities concerned to bring the whole country
under its purview for quick industrialization, particularly the
northern region.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Bangabandhu Jamuna Bridge, the longest
bridge in South Asia which opened to traffic in June last year
connecting the northwestern region with the central and
southeastern parts of the country, has created opportunities for
setting up industries, particularly agro-based ones, in the
region, she said.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Stresses Need to Defuse Tension in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Sunday telephoned his Indian counterpart, Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, to discuss the latest tension in the disputed Kashmir
area.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Foreign Office Sunday evening
said Sharif telephoned Vajpayee after Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz had briefed him on his meetings with Vajpayee and Indian
Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh in New Delhi Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sharif reiterated Pakistan's desire to defuse the current
situation on the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that India would join Pakistan in
devising mutually acceptable approaches to preserve peace and
prevent the region from descending into chaos and conflagration.
</P>
<P>
"It is incumbent on the leadership to avert any further
aggravation which will be detrimental to the economic development
efforts in both countries," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to promote durable peace and security
through the process of dialogue and peaceful negotiations in
pursuance of the Lahore Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan believed that both countries should respect the
sanctity of the LoC and exert every effort for de-escalation and
return of peace and normalcy, the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India have been engaging in intense artillery
fighting since early May. Sharif made a telephone call to Vajpayee
on May 28, proposing to send his foreign minister to New Delhi for
discussions on ways and means to defuse the tension.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Aziz Saturday made a one-day visit to New
Delhi, where he had talks with his Indian counterpart, Singh, and
Vajpayee on the latest situation in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides failed to achieve any progress in their
talks because of major differences. Aziz has asked Singh to visit
Islamabad for further talks.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposition Alliance Stages Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance
staged a day-long hartal (strike) on Sunday which ended largely
peacefully throughout the country despite sporadic incidents,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Ten persons, including five policemen, were injured and police
arrested 21 hartal activists during hartal hours.
</P>
<P>
One man was killed Saturday night when a bomb he was making
exploded, reportedly for use in the hartal.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), and its allies called the hartal to protest the proposed
national budget for the 1999-2000 fiscal year, which they slammed
as "anti-people." The budget was presented to the parliament on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several street marches both to enforce and oppose the hartal
were held in the city, but police said no major violence was
reported throughout the day except some sporadic incidents.
</P>
<P>
Most private cars and motor vehicles stayed off the road, for
fear of destruction, but buses and other public transports
operated on different routes in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Sunday evening, BNP Secretary General
Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan announced that the BNP would observe June 18
as a "protest day" to further protest the proposed budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Fan Yushu, a 47-year-old project
manager for a construction company in north China's Tianjin
Municipality, has won acclaim for placing high priority on
engineering quality.
</P>
<P>
A series of fatal accidents in China, including collapse of
bridges and buildings, due to poor engineering quality have
aroused great concern amongst the governments and people. A number
of corrupt officials and businessmen responsible for the accidents
have been subject to severe punishment
</P>
<P>
Thirty years of diligent work and achievements has established
Fan's reputation as a "trusted contractor".
</P>
<P>
Fan, a senior engineer, graduated from the Tianjin Construction
Engineering School in 1969 and thereafter continued his education
on a part-time basis.
</P>
<P>
The senior engineer not only developed his own managerial style,
but also significantly improved project quality and efficiency.
The Ministry of Construction recognized his achievements by
publishing a national textbook to train project managers in
accordance with Fan's methods.
</P>
<P>
Fan has devoted himself to ensuring the highest level of
engineering quality and has staunchly avoided even the slightest
hint of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Fan has been responsible for 18 engineering projects covering
300,000 sq.m. over the past 30-odd years. The projects have been
cited for high quality, with two projects winning the Lu Ban Award,
the top national award for high quality engineering projects.

WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Hundreds of Yugoslav soldiers, packed in military vehicles,
pulled out of the battered city of Pristina early Sunday local
time.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton renewed a call for "fast track'
authority to negotiate international trade agreements with
improved labor and environmental safeguards.
</P>
<P>
-- Top computer industry executives stormed Washington last
week in search of liberalized export regulations for computer
sales to China and other emerging markets, predicting a sharp
decline in exports within months unless the government's
definition of "supercomputers" is drastically revised.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said that President
Boris Yeltsin had authorized the early entry of Russian troops

NATO allies.

indictments of President Clinton or Hillary Rodham Clinton but has

<HEADLINE> China's English Coach Wants Vieri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bobby Houghton, the Englishman
who takes the helm of the Chinese national side, would like to add
Italian international striker Christian Vieri to his attacking
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
When asked about if possible which forward he would want to
improve his much criticized attacking force, the 52-year-old, who
is also in charge of the Chinese Olympic team, made no secret of
his choice for the Italian striker. 0e said Vieri would be what he
desired.
</P>
<P>
The powerful center forward this week became the world's most
expensive player as Inter Milan splashed 50 million U.S. dollars
to sign him from Lazio.
</P>
<P>
Houghton's under-23 side had been well contained by a defence-
minded Vietnamese side and did not break the ice until the 50th
minute in a Asian Group Seven second leg Olympic qualifier here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The home side eventually managed three goals but their closest
rivals the Democratic People's Republic Korea went on a goal spree
in their 6-0 rout of Myanmar at an earlier fixture yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Houghton once complained that he came to nothing in his search
for a Chinese player who possesses strong body as well as mind to
control the ball in the opposite box.
</P>
<P>
China has all but set their foot on the second round qualifying
tournament after winning all of the three first-leg matches in
Hanoi two weeks ago, but Houghton's men received more no than yes.
</P>
<P>
Their labourious way of victory came under heavy fire from the
domestic media who claimed China triumphed by strong physique
rather than superior tactics.
</P>
<P>
China needed more than 40 minutes to break the deadlock against
minnows Vietnam and Myanmar and only deprived one goal of a 10-man
DPR Korea in the first leg matches.
</P>
<P>
The winner of Group Seven will advance to the second round of
Olympic qualifiers, meeting eight other group winners from across
Asia in a three-group round robin competition. The top three
finishers will qualify for Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Russia: NATO Fails to Fulfill UN Resolution on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Sunday accused NATO of
not observing the provisions of the UN Security Council resolution
on Kosovo or the military technical agreements with the Yugoslav
military leadership.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking Defense Ministry official said NATO does not
observe the provision "on the impermissibility of security vacuum
and the disarmament of the Kosovo Liberation Army," the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry believes that such a violation of obligations "is
creating an explosive situation and threatening the lives of
Russian troops that entered Pristina."
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Russian peacekeepers in Pristina said the
vacuum, formed after the withdrawal of Yugoslav army units from
Kosovo is filled by KLA fighters, is also causing "an exodus of
the Serbian population from Kosovo," Interfax reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Delta State government is
expected to come up with a comprehensive peace program next week
to disarm the warring youths and provide them with training
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The state's governor Chief James Ibori is scheduled to announce
the plan on his first state-wide radio address next week, Nigerian
newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The plans will offer cash and job placements after a short term
training to those youths who surrenders their guns, government
sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, soldiers in Warri region are continuing their
search for militant youths. The oil city and its environs are
generally calm when the curfew is still in place Saturday and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Delta state government is reportedly discussing with police and
federal authorities to work out an appropriate amnesty so that
those who return their weapons will not fear any reprisals from
law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
Peace agreements are expected to be reached first between the
warring tribes and then between the communities and oil companies,
said a Nigerian daily This Day.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo Friday pleaded for time to
 enable his government to resolve the underlying problems behind
the Warri crisis when he visited the city after ethnic clashes has
claimed about 300 lives.
</P>
<P>
In an address Friday after arriving Port Harcourt, the capital
of Nigeria's Rivers State, the president said the federal
government is soon to set up a new body to develop the Niger delta
region..
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, currently on an assessment trip to the oil rich Niger
delta region is expected to hold a talks with the ethnic groups in
the region including the Ijaws, Itsekiris and Urhobos, the three
major parties in the Warri conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Niger delta region generates nearly all of the country's
oil and above 90 percent of the nation's foreign currency reserve,
yet it finds itself struggling in deep poverty.
</P>
<P>
Wide-spread unemployment and deep poverty are blamed for the
frequent and rampant conflicts in the region, while idle youths
kidnapping oil company personnel and warring with each other are
common places in the area.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Won't Seek Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has said there is need to change presidential leadership to allow
new people with fresh ideas to take over if countries are to
develop, Zambia newspaper Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a special interview with reporters at State House
Saturday, Chiluba said the countries that had experienced higher
growth rates were those which had a high turnover of presidential
leadership because new leaders brought in new ideas of development
and governance.
</P>
<P>
The president said because of his strong beliefs in the need
for change, he would not seek re-election as president when his
term of office comes to an end in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a trend setter in Zambian politics. I will honor
my words to retire," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba dismissed suspicions by some opposition parties that he
might seek another term to office during the 2001 presidential and
general elections.
</P>
<P>
He said there was need to give way to others to rule the
country because there was no expert in governing people.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the
president said he was hopeful that a comprehensive peace pact
would be signed in the next two weeks by all the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said, there was a team going around to consult
stakeholders in Rwanda, Uganda and the rebels in DRC to tie the
loose ends to the pact.
</P>
<P>
The major issues that had held the peace talks, such as
allowing the rebels to attend the peace talks, had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, observed that signing a peace pact was
not the end to the problems in the vast central African country.
The internal political system had to be sorted out after foreign
troops had been withdrawn and prisoners of war exchanged.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has donated
four helicopters to the Tanzania People's Defense Forces (TPDF)
for various activities such as relief operation in natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
The donation has been made in reward for the contribution the
government and people of Tanzania had made toward the liberation
of Africa, Sunday Observer quoted South Africa's Defense Minister
Joe Modise as saying.
</P>
<P>
Modise, who attended a signing ceremony on defense cooperation
Saturday in Dar es Salaam, praised that Tanzania had sacrificed
everything to become the cradle of decolonization and a home of
African liberation.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Tanzania and its people have gone deep into
the annals of history, because "it was here where the victory of
the people of Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa
and many others were forged."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said South Africa will continue to
strengthen relations and deepen friendship with Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the bilateral relations between the South
African National Defense Forces and the TPDF are on a sound
footing, citing military training, staff courses and military
divers courses hosted by South Africa as examples.
</P>
<P>
The general upward trend of increased investment and trade
between the two countries, he said, is showing healthy growth,
which in itself is a major positive factor.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Defense Minister Edgar Maokola-Majogo said his
country will cherish the assistance provided by South Africa and
use the helicopters for intended purpose.

<HEADLINE> China Reforms Grain Distribution System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has adopted
new measures to promote a grain distribution system oriented to
the market.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chunzheng, vice-minister of the State Development and
Planning Commission (SDPC) said state-owned grain firms and
farmers should be informed that grain prices are ultimately
determined by the market. He added that future grain production
should be guided solely by market demand.
</P>
<P>
The central government plans to phase out price protection for
poor quality and oversupplied grain varieties such as the spring
wheat in northeast China, early long-grained rice in south China
and wheat in the areas south of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
State protected purchase prices for related grain will be
lowered this year while the interests of farmers will be taken
into account, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The government will also adopt a new purchase pricing system
which allows wider price gaps in line with market demand and grain
quality.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the readjustment policy will affect the income
some farmers earn from grain production. However, he said the
measures will guide farmers to grow more high-quality grain
varieties and will thus be conducive to their long-term interests.

<HEADLINE> Progress Reported in Talks on Russian Role in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Sunday that
considerable progress has been made in its talks with U.S. on
Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side is showing readiness to listen to Russia's
point of view and to attain the main goal which is full
implementation of the resolution of the UN Security Council,"
Kremlin deputy chief Sergei Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of talks between Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
ended early Sunday and both expressed satisfaction with the
results of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the talks, which also touched on bilateral ties,
have removed tension created by the introduction of Russian
peacekeeping force into Kosovo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the entry of some 200 Russian troops into
the Yugoslav province in the early hours of Saturday before an
agreement was reached on their role, as had been promised before.
Ivanov had initially described the entry as an "unfortunate
mistake" and added that the troops would be ordered to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
The troops have since remained and now control the Slatina
airport near Pristina, the Kosovo capital, with no sign of pulling
out.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Sunday that the Russian troops "will stay where
they now are" for a transition period, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said as soon as the areas of permanent deployment of
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo are established, a zone
of responsibility will be assigned to the Russian peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov stressed that "neither Russia, nor anybody else wanted
Kosovo to be divided" and that everybody sticks to the opinion
that Kosovo should remain part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said talks on specific aspects of different peacekeeping
contingents' stay in Kosovo would be continued so that "all the
equivocal issues should be worked out and our peacekeepers could
efficiently perform their international mission."
</P>
<P>
Talbott, for his part, said he had agreed with Ivanov on
certain points, but admitted that the problem of responsibility
sectors in Kosovo was still divisive.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that differences between the two sides
were surmountable, as the main thing was to make the Kosovo peace
process irreversible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ivanov said Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S.
President Bill Clinton will have a telephone conversation later
Sunday to discuss Kosovo and the upcoming summit of Russia and
seven industrial nations, or G-8, in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is scheduled to attend the summit, scheduled to start
on June 18, and hold bilateral meetings with Clinton and German
Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder.

<TEXT>
<P>
In addition, large grain processing enterprises and forage
producers will be allowed to directly purchase grain from farmers
in lieu of non-resale agreements.
</P>
<P>
China has recorded good grain harvests for the past four
consecutive years. However, the fact that the grain supply has
generally met or outstripped demand has resulted in mounting
stockpiles and increasing pressure on the state's fiscal
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the goal for reforming the grain distribution system
is to readjust the product mix and improve quality. He noted the
measures are also aimed further promoting the competitiveness of
Chinese grain on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Wang also called on grain enterprises to sell grain at minimum
profits in order to ensure the success of efforts to reform the
grain distribution system.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress has been achieved since central authorities
initiated nationwide reform of the grain distribution system in
May last year. Related efforts have protected the interests of
farmers and ensured normal grain production, said Wang, adding
that most state-owned grain enterprises have since earned profits.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi National Assembly Warns Iran Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly on Sunday
warned Iran against consequences of repeating its aggressive acts
against Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the INA, the National Assembly said
that the missile aggression launched by the Iranian forces last
Thursday is a dangerous escalation which is part and parcel of the
U.S.-Zionist anti-Iraq aggression.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that last Thursday Iran launched three
missiles at bases of Mujahedeen (Iranian armed opposition in Iraq)
inside Iraq, causing the injuries of several Iraqi citizens.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the Arab League and the Inter-Arab
Parliamentary Union to condemn the aggressive acts as being a
serious threat to the pan-Arab security.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on U.N. Security Council to live up to
its responsibility and work for maintaining Iraq's sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity and put a stop to Iran's
breachings of international law and good-neighborly
relations.

<HEADLINE> UK: Russia's Row With NATO on Kosovo May Hurt Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Continued wrangling over the role
of Russia's troops in Kosovo will not help Russia's chances of
winning Western financial aid at an upcoming Group of Eight
meeting of major economic powers, British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"A continued disunity ... on display in Moscow ... would
hardly encourage the financial community next week when they are
looking to financially help Russia" at the G8 meeting in Cologne,
Germany, Robertson told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock between Russian and NATO troops at the Pristina
airport entered its second day on Sunday. British troops who
arrived there on Saturday found the Russians in control at the
airbase where NATO had planned to set up its command headquarters,
and the Russians stopped the French from entering the airport on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Robertson's remarks appeared to be the first public warning
from frustrated NATO leaders that Russia could be in danger of
losing western financial aid because of the Kosovo standoff.
</P>
<P>
But in another development, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov has pledged Moscow will not send any more troops into
Kosovo without NATO's agreement, according to British Foreign
Minister Robin Cook on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cook was quoted by Reuters as telling reporters he had spoken
to Ivanov by telephone on Sunday and they agreed "there should be
no surprise moves by either side" like the one Russia made this
week by rushing troops to Kosovo ahead of NATO. Ivanov told him "
there will be prior agreement with the NATO countries before any
more Russian troops are moved to Kosovo," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Russia stunned NATO on Friday night when its paratroopers
crossed from Bosnia into Yugoslavia and moved south into Kosovo
where they took control of the Pristina airport, thwarting NATO
plans to make the base its command headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that Ivanov had promised those Russian troops, which
number about 200, would be absorbed into the international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo and not operate separately from it.
NATO has insisted it will lead the Kosovo peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
"Igor Ivanov has given me assurances that the Russian troops at
the airport will be absorbed into the Kosovo force," Cook said in
London. "They will not be operating as a separate unit."
</P>
<P>
He said the "precise location" in which the Russian forces
would be placed had yet to be resolved.

<HEADLINE> Over 2,300 HIV Carriers Among Russian Convicts, Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 13 (Xinhua) -- There are over 2,300 HIV-infected
and 92,000 tuberculosis patients in Russian prisons and pre-trial
centers, the Interfax news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The high incidence of epidemic diseases has, among other things,
been blamed on over-crowdedness in the facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Russian penitentiary system now has 985 institutions, which
hold over 1 million people, 720,000 of them convicts, 265,000
suspects awaiting trial and 20,000 juvenile delinquents.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov said here Friday that the
number of people held in the prisons and detention centers might
be cut by nearly a half by the end of next year when the country
implements a planned amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, State Duma (the lower house of parliament),
in its first reading, passed a resolution on the release of 94,000
prisoners, mainly those involved in lesser crimes and "do not pose
a public threat."
</P>
<P>
Krasheninnikov said the reform of the correctional institutions
is aimed at the "humanization of the penitentiary system" and that
alternative punishment, including fines for minor crimes, should
be more frequently imposed.
</P>
<P>
The number of arrests should be reduced to a minimum, with the
exception of those committing particularly serious crimes, he said.

<HEADLINE> European Voters Go To Polls For EU Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Voters in 11 European Union (EU)
member states went to polls on Sunday to vote in the final day for
a new European Parliament, the EU's legislative and supervisory
branch.
</P>
<P>
Among the 11 countries, Greece was first to open the polling
booths, followed by Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The other four EU member states held the voting earlier as
voters in Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands went to polls on
Thursday, and in Ireland on Friday for the 626-seat assembly,
which brings together parliamentarians from all 15 EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU legislation, the parliament's 626 seats have to be
filled during the election. EU official reports said 10,527
candidates, distributed amongst 299 lists, are in the running to
win the hearts of 297.9 million voters.
</P>
<P>
The turnout is already reported to be average everywhere, even
very low in Britain, but may be higher in countries where general
elections are being held at the same time, such as Luxembourg and
Belgium, a latest EU report said.
</P>
<P>
EU sources predict that such mood of apathy for voting could
undermine the European Parliament's resolve to act as a channel to
allow European citizens to have a bigger say in European affairs.

<HEADLINE> Two Belgians Abducted in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Two Belgians were abducted by three
gunmen Sunday after they boarded their pleasure boat in Zamboanga
City, the southern Philippines, police said.
</P>
<P>
Leiven Dela Marche, 37, and Eric Bracke, 39, were aboard a
small boat on their way to visit Santa Cruz Island, about 1.5
nautical miles from Zamboanga City when the gunmen aboard another
boat intercepted them in the morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the suspects seized the two men and
took them to the nearby Sacol Island, a known territory of armed
Muslim separatist groups.
</P>
<P>
Bracke is a visiting journalist while Marche is the chief
technical adviser of a Belgium government project providing funds
and technology to a Philippine land reform program in the south.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the abduction, although
police said they suspect either the extremist Abu Sayyaf group or
the larger separatist group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, is
behind the abduction.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mbeki Seeks Control of Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- With only three days before
officially taking over the presidency, South African
president-elect Thabo Mbeki is busy selecting cabinet members but
trying to make the selection on his own.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Mbeki is using the selection to
stamp his authority on the African National Congress (ANC),
shunning consultations and appointing the people he believed are
best suited for the jobs.
</P>
<P>
He did not even consult the ANC's allies -- the Congress of
South Africa Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist
Party (SACP), indicating his and the ANC's supremacy in the
tripartite alliance.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the ANC said Mbeki wants to retain control of
the selection to prevent divisive lobbying and mudslinging in the
organization' s top ranks.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet's formation will be different from that in 1994
and the subsequent reshuffles, where there were substantive
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki has promised to make effective the main criteria in the
appointment of his cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
He is moving toward this end -- centralizing control of his
executives and to impose his will directly on ministers and their
directors-general.
</P>
<P>
There is nothing wrong with this, provided its effect is the
improvement of performance and not the quashing of original,
critical thinking, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
ANC sources said Mbeki will retain some old faces and bring in
new ones in the cabinet, but those selected are not because of
their popularity but because of their ability to perform and to
abide by his rules.
</P>
<P>
Besides the cabinet positions, Mbeki is also determined to
place capable ANC people in the chairmanship of parliamentary
committees and the key director-generalships, positions that will
have to be filled in coming months.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was expected to break the news of his cabinet
appointments to his National Working Committee (NWC) in Cape Town
later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Developments in his planned line-up include the appointment of
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to the
deputy presidency, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Peter Mokaba, the deputy environmental affairs minister who as
ANC Youth League president secured Mbeki the chairmanship of the
party in 1994, is set to be promoted to a full cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
Naledi Pandor, a prominent educationist and an ANC MP, is set
for education.
</P>
<P>
Nkosazana Zuma is likely to retain her health portfolio to
continue her battles with the medical industry.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ngubane, the former KwaZulu-Natal premier, will be promoted
from his arts and culture portfolio to a more powerful post.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Mufamadi, a senior ANC official, is likely to replace
Alfred Nzo as minister of foreign affairs, while public works
minister Jeff Radebe will be moved to the defense.
</P>
<P>
There is no information about the finance portfolio. But there
has been a strong call for Trevor Manuel to retain his post.
</P>
<P>
Those who will be upgraded to more powerful posts are sports
minister Steve Tshwete and home affairs deputy minister Lindiwe
Sisulu.
</P>
<P>
Arts, science, culture and technology deputy minister Bridgette
Mabandla is set to move into a full ministerial position.
</P>
<P>
Having achieved rapprochement with the IFP and peace in
KwaZulu-Natal, Jacob Zuma, the ANC deputy president, is expected
to move to national politics and take the safety and security
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to the cabinet are set to include Essop Pahad, a
long-time confidante of Mbeki, in the posts, telecommunications
and broadcasting portfolio.

<HEADLINE> Manila Prepares Arrest Warrants for Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
preparing warrants for the arrest of the National Democratic Front
(NDF) leaders, who have lost their immunity due to NDF's
termination of peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Serafin Cuevas of the Department of Justice said
Sunday that his office is now working with the Philippine National
Police and National Bureau of Investigation in the preparation of
the arrest warrants.
</P>
<P>
"This service of warrants of arrest will only be covering those
involved in the peace treaty negotiations. They do not involve
other members of other insurgent groups," Cuevas said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity
Guarantees, which had bestowed on these leaders immunity from
arrest and prosecution, became void after the end of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Cuevas said, NDF leaders with standing arrest
warrants but had been extended immunity guarantees for purposes of
the peace negotiations, would now find themselves subject to
arrest again.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, an umbrella organization of all left-leaning groups in
the country, ended their peace talks with the government last
month after the Philippine Senate ratified the Visiting Forces
Agreement with the United States, allowing the resumption of
large-scale joint military exercises in the country.

<HEADLINE> hke - Decision on Beleaguered Aussie IOC Member Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The executive board of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Sunday postponed for 24
hours making a decision on the fate of Australian IOC member Phil
Coles.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member executive board had been expected reach a verdict
on Coles on Sunday but IOC director-general Francois Carrard
announced on Sunday that it had been decided discussions would
continue into Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A decision regarding Mr. Phil Coles will be taken and
announced tommorrow before lunch," Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to give any details of the discussions already
held. "I cannot make any further comment. I won't tell anything,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Coles has denied sending confidential files, which included
embarrassing personal notes on IOC colleagues prepared by himself
and his partner Patricia Rosenbrock, to Salt Lake City. The
American city won the bid to host the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
He was warned by IOC earlier this year for accepting free trips
to Salt Lake City and he was told that any more wrongdoing would
cause him being driven out of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Coles was later accused of accepting free jewellery from a
businessman associated with an unsuccessful bid by Athens.. The
allegation was later confirmed by his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a report by Atlanta Olympic organizers named Coles
as one of six International Olympic Committee members who took two
or more companions on trips to Atlanta at the city's expense
during its bid for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
IOC rules limit members to one companion on such trips, but
Coles was reported to take two when he visited in July 1989 at a
cost of 13,053 U.S. dollars, the report said.

SHANGHAI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The P.L.A. Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) team beat Shanghai Edelweiss in an
all-Chinese affair to win the title of the first World Table
Tennis Club Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC, which consists of double Olympic champion Liu

lost the first match to young paddler Feng Zhe of Edelweiss 21-15,
17-21 and 19-21.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fewer Than 1 in 4 in UK Backs Euro: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) - The UK's support for joining the
European single currency has plunged to the lowest level since the
Labour came to power, according to an exclusive Mori poll for The
Sunday Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than one voter in four now favors monetary union, down
from one in three a year ago, while opposition to EMU has risen
from 50 percent to 57 percent, the Mori poll reveals.
</P>
<P>
The findings suggest that Prime Minister Tony Blair's positive
approach to the EU has had no impact, but he would have more
effect if he were to "urge" joining the single currency.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic change of tone Saturday, officials at the Prime
Minister's Office suggested that Blair would now not play a
leading role in the campaign for a "yes" vote on the euro until he
decides the time is right to call a referendum.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister does not feel there is any need to persuade

Analysts here believe that Tony Blair now faces the danger that
his attempts to forge a powerful cross-party alliance in favor of
the single currency will collapse unless he gives a public lead.

<HEADLINE> Disasters Kill 13,000 People Yearly in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 13,000 people are killed,
19,000 injured and more than 1 million affected by natural
disasters every year in Bangladesh, the national news agency BSS
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The disaster risk, to which Bangladesh is exposed, is among the
highest in the world, BSS quoted the data compiled by the Disaster
Management and Relief Ministry after last year's worst flood as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the combined disasters in the SAARC (South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation) and ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) countries, Bangladesh witnessed 90 percent while
other countries lived through 10 percent of the disasters over the
past 10 years, the data said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the proportion of population affected by natural
hazards, the data said, Bangladesh had the highest death rate --
3,910 per million persons. More than 86 percent of the total
deaths in cyclones and 48 percent of total deaths in floods
reportedly in Asia are in Bangladesh, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
The Bay of Bengal is one of the most dangerous tropical cyclone
basins in the world, the data said, noting that seven of the 10
deadliest cyclones in the current century hit Bangladesh over the
past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters like tropical cyclones, floods and tidal
surges claimed approximately 153,000 lives in Bangladesh during
the past 10 years, affected at least 50 million people and caused
over 7 billion U.S. dollars in property damage, it said.
</P>
<P>
Factors including high population density to rapid urbanization
are causing disasters when technological expansion is on increase
in a rapidly developing economic setup of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"Once a disaster strikes, local and national authorities are
forced to increase the allocation of financial and human resources
to respond to emergencies," officials of the Disaster Management
and Relief Ministry said while discussing the issue during a
recent workshop here.
</P>
<P>
The high costs of relief operations during such disasters were
using up the resources normally allocated for development, thus
slowing down the development process in the country, they stated.
</P>
<P>
In view of the increasing trend of natural disasters in
Bangladesh, the ministry has made a provision for establishing a
Bangladesh center for health emergency preparedness and research
to safeguard life and protect communities from disasters by
reducing vulnerability and disseminating solutions to major public
health and nutrition problems in a cost-efficient way.
</P>
<P>
The government, in view of its success in effectively managing
the century's worst floods last year, will take due steps to face
such calamities in the future, the BSS report said.

<P>
GAZA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
due in Cairo Monday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on stance coordination.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath
has said that the visit is aimed at maintaining "fraternal
coordination and planning for the forthcoming stage of political
settlement and negotiations with the Israeli government," Voice of
Palestine reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had visited Egypt late May, discussing with Mubarak the
prospect of covening a five-way summit to adopt a unified Arab
stance towards yet-to-be-formed Israeli government led by
newly-elected Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Four of the five concerned participants Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon
and the Palestinian National Authority, have expressed support for
the planned summit while Syria considers common ground lacked for
the meeting success.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath added that Arafat will be heading to South Africa after
his visit to Egypt to participate in a ceremonial swearing-in of
its new President Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> British Defense Chief Says Standoff In Kosovo Surmountable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said Sunday he did not think the standoff between
Russian and western troops at Pristina airport over Russia's role
in Kosovo was insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC's "Breakfast With Frost" program,
Robertson said, "There is a complication here."
</P>
<P>
"There are ways that can be found to make sure that the
Russians are slotted in, even if it's not on the basis of some
quasi-partition of Kosovo," he added.
</P>
<P>
Robertson insisted that a British general would be in command
of peacekeepers there.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his opposition to any form of partition of
Kosovo despite the presence of Russian troops who arrived at the
airport ahead of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
The standoff in Kosovo showed few signs of easing, as talks on
cooperation between units continued Sunday, a BBC correspondent
reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian and UK generals were reported to have agreed NATO can
go on the airfield. But Russia still controls part of the site --
some reports say most of it.
</P>
<P>
The Russians have reportedly promised not to deploy any more
troops in Kosovo until a deal on Moscow's role in the province's
peacekeeping force is reached.

<HEADLINE> Talks Resume on Russia's Peacekeeping Role in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott resumed
their talks here Sunday on Moscow's peacekeeping role in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Talbott said the United States is considering
an option for earmarking "a zone of responsibility", rather than a
sector, for Russian peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said he would depart for Washington upon completing the
talks with Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
The talks became deadlocked Saturday as Moscow accused the U.S.
side of taking "a sticky unproductive position."
</P>
<P>
One Russian negotiator said Talbott "heed none of the plans
offered by the Russian delegation to deploy Russian peace-keepers
in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"In the atmosphere of the talks itself, neglect is felt for the
interests of Russia, which by its actions has won the right for
presence in Kosovo. The impression is that the American side is
trying to usurp the right to its own exclusive presence in the
region, leaving a secondary role for Russia," the Interfax news
agency quoted the unidentified negotiator as saying.
</P>
<P>
The talks followed the entry into Kosovo by some 200 Russian
troops in the early hours of Saturday, a move Ivanov said was an
unfortunate mistake and that orders had been given for them to
pull out.
</P>
<P>
In stead of withdrawing from Kosovo, there are reports that
Moscow may airlift more of its peacekeeping troops into the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Quoting military and diplomatic sources in Moscow, Interfax
said Russia would apparently expand its military presence in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that an additional contingent of several
hundred servicemen is planned to be airlifted to Pristina, the
Kosovo capital where about 200 paratroopers are now stationed.
</P>
<P>
Ready for the airlift are units from the rapid reaction forces,
based at Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Pskov. Each of the three air force
bases has prepared three Il-76 transport planes for the flight,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The planes with personnel and hardware are expected to fly
through the air space provided by Ukraine and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Hungary has denied access to its air space, citing its
commitments to NATO's leadership.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian general Viktor Zavarzin met
late Saturday with British commander general Mike Jackson at the
Slatina airport several kilometers from Pristina, capital of the
Kosovo province, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held at the request of Jackson, took place inside
the vehicle of the Russian general, Tass quoted Zavarzin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We did not touch upon issues of big policy. We settled
specific issues of interaction aimed at implementing the U.N.
Security Council's resolution on stabilization in Kosovo,"
Zavarzin said.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed variants of joint use of Slatina airport
which is under control of Russian troops now, but in prospect can
be used for common purposes of stabilization, Zavarzin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of Russian military experts, who flew to
Macedonia Saturday afternoon together with U.S. generals for
consultations on the Kosovo settlement, returned to Moscow early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The experts were to familiarize themselves with the plan of the
NATO operation in Kosovo and discuss issues concerning Russian
participation in the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
No information is available on the outcome of the consultations,
Tass said.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has donated four
helicopters to the Tanzania People's Defense Forces (TPDF) for various
activities such as relief operation in natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The donation has been made in reward for the contribution the government
and people of Tanzania had made toward the liberation of Africa, Sunday
Observer quoted South Africa's Defense Minister Joe Modise as saying.
</P>
<P>
Modise, who attended a signing ceremony on defense cooperation Saturday
in Dar es Salaam, praised that Tanzania had sacrificed everything to become
the cradle of decolonization and a home of African liberation.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Tanzania and its people have gone deep into the annals
of history, because it "was here where the victory of the people of
Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa and many others were
forged."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said South Africa will continue to strengthen
relations and deepen friendship with Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the bilateral relations between the South African
National Defense Forces and the TPDF are on a sound footing, citing
military training, staff courses and military divers courses hosted by
South Africa as examples.
</P>
<P>
The general upward trend of increased investment and trade between the
two countries, he said, is showing healthy growth, which in itself is a
major positive factor.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Defense Minister Edgar Maokola-Majogo said his country will
cherish the assistance provided by South Africa and use the helicopters for
intended purpose.

LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has said
there is need to change presidential leadership to allow new people with
fresh ideas to take over if countries are to develop, Zambia newspaper
Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a special interview with reporters at State House Saturday,
Chiluba said the countries that had experienced higher growth rates were
those which had a high turnover of presidential leadership because new
leaders brought in new ideas of development and governance.
</P>
<P>
The president said because of his strong beliefs in the need for change,
he would not seek re-election as president when his term of office comes to
an end in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a trend setter in Zambian politics. I will honor my words
to retire," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba dismissed suspicions by some opposition parties that he might
seek another term to office during the 2001 presidential and general
elections.
</P>
<P>
He said there was need to give way to others to rule the country because
there was no expert in governing people.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the president said
he was hopeful that a comprehensive peace pact would be signed in the next
two weeks by all the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said, there was a team going around to consult
stakeholders in Rwanda, Uganda and the rebels in DRC to tie the loose ends
to the pact.
</P>
<P>
The major issues that had held the peace talks, such as allowing the
rebels to attend the peace talks, had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, observed that signing a peace pact was not the
end to the problems in the vast central African country. The internal
political system had to be sorted out after foreign troops had been
withdrawn and prisoners of war exchanged.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel officially announced
Sunday to deny the entry into Israel and Palestinian territories
of a Palestinian prominent figure who admitted being responsible
for the 1972 killing of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed security
forces to refuse the entry of Abu Daoud after consultations with
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi and
Attorney-General Elyakin Rubinstein Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Daoud has explicitly admitted being responsible for the deaths
of 11 Israeli athletes at Munich Olympics, Germany, in his book
and recent press interviews, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has ordered Daoud's VIP pass revoked immediately
following his admission.
</P>
<P>
The Munich police issued an arrest warrant last Friday for
Daoud after he admitted in his new autobiography his role in the
Munich attack that left 17 people dead, including 11 Israeli
athletes.
</P>
<P>
Daoud, also called Mohammed Daoud Uda, planned to enter Israel
Sunday or Monday by the Allenby Bridge between the West Bank and
Jordan, on his way to the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Daoud visited Israel in 1996 for a meeting of the Palestinian
National Council.

Research Institute (FNRI), an attached agency of the Department of
Science and Technology, has developed three new food products--the
Food Bars, Instant Cream Soups and Compressed Food-- for emergency
feeding during disasters.
</P>
<P>
The FNRI said in a recently released report that the Food Bar
is made from the combinations of cereals, legumes and oilseeds
flour, which provide energy and adequate amount of protein. It
comes in three flavors--tropical fruit, peanut and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
Consuming six bars (approximately 20 grams each) in a day will
satisfy one-third of a 4-6 year old child's daily need for protein
and energy.
</P>
<P>
These products are ready-to-eat, appealing and nutritious, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Compressed Food is a ready-to-eat cereal-legume based
nutritious food with milk, vegetable fat and sugar. Consuming
eight pieces (approximately 15 grams each) of this food in a day
will satisfy two-thirds of a 4-6 year old child's daily need for
protein and one-third for energy.
</P>
<P>
The product is one of the best forms of relief goods because it
is light, compact, convenient to handle and store, and easy to
distribute. It can also be prepared into porridge by just adding
hot water.
</P>
<P>
The Squash Instant Cream Soup and Instant Mongo Cream Soup are
combinations of vegetables and legumes with spices and flavors.
The products are delicious, nutritious and convenient to prepare.
</P>
<P>
Since they are in powdered form, they are easy to handle and
transport. Consuming five cups of Cream Soup (containing 30 grams
cream powder in 1 cup water) in a day will satisfy the daily needs
for protein and one-third for energy of a 4-6 year old child.
</P>
<P>
The FNRI pointed out that these products, which are very
nutritious and convenient, provide the much needed relief in any
disaster that may hit a community.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urged to Crackdown on Bonded Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippines' Deputy House Speaker
Eduardo Gullas has urged the Departments of Labor and Employment
and Social Welfare and Development to crackdown on bonded child
labor, which he described as "immoral and inhuman."
</P>
<P>
Gullas lamented Sunday in a statement that the practice of
"selling" children for work in order to pay debts incurred by
their parents remains widespread.
</P>
<P>
"Bonded labor is probably one of the most cruel forms of child
abuse," the lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
Citing a government labor force survey, Gullas said an estimate
29,000 Filipino children aged 10-14 now work as domestic helpers,
and many of them are believed to be bonded.
</P>
<P>
"These bonded child laborers are virtual slaves. They are not
being paid anything at all. They are also forced to work and live
under subhuman conditions," Gullas said.
</P>
<P>
"We already have enough laws banning and penalizing bonded
child labor. The problem is essentially poor (law) enforcement,"
Gullas pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is for the agencies concerned to demonstrate
greater political will in fighting child labor, whether bonded or
not," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gullas urged the government to run after both the parents and
employers of bonded child laborers.
</P>
<P>
"They should be held liable for violating our labor, penal and
child welfare laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gullas also said the government should start deputizing local
officials to conduct surveillance work in their respective
communities to put bonded child labor in check.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that apart from working as domestic helpers in the
urban areas, many of the country's bonded child laborers work as
farm helpers in the countryside.

<HEADLINE> Barak Starts Portfolio Talks With Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak started Sunday the portfolio distribution talks with
leaders of potential coalition partners, hoping to present the new
government list to the Parliament by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
Barak will tell the partners, which include Meretz, the Center
Party, National Religious Party, Yisrael Ba'aliya and Shinui, what
portfolio they can get, one senior One Israel source said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Barak, leader of One Israel, is considering giving out a
ministerial post for every four Knesset (parliament) members, the
source added.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Barak has no plan to hold such talks with
leaders of Ultra-Orthodox Shas Party or right-wing Likud of which
the outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been the
leader, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Formal contacts with Shas, whose leader Aryhe Deri has been
sentenced to four years of imprisonment for bribe-taking, broke
down one week ago and have not resummed due to the failure to
arrange a venue for a meeting between Barak and Shas' spiritual
leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.
</P>
<P>
Those parties currently slated for the opposition are the
Likud, Shas, the three Arab parties, the National Union, Yisrael
Beiteinu (Israel Our Home) and United Torah Judaism (UTJ), which
means Barak may start with a narrow government enjoying either 61
or 66 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between One Israel and UTJ are to resume Sunday in
an attempt to reach a compromise on drafting religious students
into the army, hoping the UTJ can change its position against the
enlistment of religious students so that it can join the coalition.
</P>
<P>
If the UTJ joins the the coalition, the ruling party can get 66
seats.
</P>
<P>
The chances for Likud to join the coalition before it votes for
a new party leader in September are slim, but a third meeting is
scheduled for the next few days between Barak and Likud's acting
leader Ariel Sharon, who is interested in joining the coalition.
</P>
<P>
But senior members of the Labor party, the source said, have
warned Barak against taking Likud as a partner, saying although
Likud has 19 Knesset seats, the government can not expect the
parliamentary support of more than nine of Likud's lawmakers on
issues related to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Labor, part of One Israel, still prefers Shas, which has
moderate stance on the peace process, to join the coalition. But
One Israel's sister party Meretz, stands firmly against Shas'
entry.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senator Urges Tougher Anti-child Labor Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senator Loren Legarda
urged Sunday her colleagues in Congress to expedite the passage of
a tougher anti-child labor measure that seeks to impose a heavier
penalty on establishments or individuals that employ minors in
hazardous work.
</P>
<P>
Legarda said in a statement that some 300,000 Filipino child
laborers are believed to suffer from work-related injury or
disease.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents eight percent of the estimated 3.7
million working children aged 5 to 17 years.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the National Statistics Office
showed that 60 percent or 2.2 million of the country's working
children are exposed to hazardous work environment, including
poisonous and carcinogenic elements.
</P>
<P>
"What aggravates the plight of children employed in hazardous
work is that they are not covered either by social security
protection or employee compensation when they contract disease or
suffer injury at work, because they are illegally employed,"
Legarda pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine law, it is illegal to employ children
below 15 years old, except under special conditions where they are
adequately protected. It is also prohibited to employ children
aged 15 to 17 years under hazardous work conditions.
</P>
<P>
Legarda said employers should suffer a heavier penalty if they
exploit children to manufacture firecrackers, handle pesticides,
engage in deep sea fishing, expose them to fire, flammable
substances, toxic chemicals and other potentially harmful
substances or dangerous elements.
</P>
<P>
Legarda, meanwhile, backed the proposal of a professor of the
Philippine University for the Employees Compensation Commission to
set aside funds for the compensation of working children, even if
they do not pay social security dues and are just contractual
workers.

KATHMANDU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has to import 80 percent

</P>

Medicines worth 5 billion rupees (74 million U.S. dollars) are
consumed every year in Nepal, but the kingdom produces only 20
percent of them, RSS said, quoting figures provided by the
Association of Pharmaceutical Producers of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical producers complained that the government has not
given appropriate concessions and incentives for medicine
manufacturing in the country.
</P>
<P>
They said more tax was levied on medicines manufactured in the
country than medicines imported from other countries, and
sub-standard medicines found their way into Nepal from India at

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In the next two or three days, Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak will hold intensive talks with leaders of some
political parties, which may join the new yet-to-formed coalition.
</P>
<P>
However, for the time being, the party list does not include
heads of the Ultra-Orthodox Shas Party or United Torah Judaism
Party, a senior source of the left-wing One Israel led by Barak
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A Palestinian, who has admitted being responsible for the
1976 murder of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich, is expected
to enter Israel Sunday or Monday, on his way to the West Bank
city of Ramallah. An arrest warrant for him, issued by the German
authorities, has created a dilemma for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the German request could lead to a crisis in
relations with Germany, while carrying out the arrest is likely to
incur a confrontation with the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli high schools will launch anti-violence campaign on
Sunday, Israeli Education Ministry decided Friday following the
killing of a high school student by another student on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Thais Confident of Clinching Two Golds in King's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Thailand have
a bright chance of landing at least two gold medals and can hope
for miracles for another three finals in the 23rd King's Cup
Amateur Boxing tournament Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The featherweight final turned out to be an all-Thai event with
Olympic gold medallist Somluck Khamsing taking rising star
Suttisak Samaksaman. A gold medal is as good as in the kingdom's
pocket before a punch is delivered.
</P>
<P>
Suttisak, a renowned Muay Thai (Thai kickboxing) player,
outpointed Cuban's Enrique Garrion in the semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Though Suttisak is good, local hero Somluck is still considered
better, who is believed to have 70 percent chance to win the final.
</P>
<P>
In the bantamweight class, defending champion Sontaya
Wongprates, who beat Cuban Waldemar Forist in the preliminary
round, hopes to repeat the victory, but this time in the final.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Cuban head coach Juan Fontanial said that Forist has
many tactic problems and Sontaya has a better chance to win.
</P>
<P>
Three other Thai finalists, however, have lesser chance of
clinching gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Light flyweight Suban Pannon will meet world champion, Cuba's
Maikro Romero, while light welterweight Jakkrit Suwannalird will
take Kazakh Bayurkhan Zhaksybayev, who is going better in every
match.
</P>
<P>
Defending welterweight champion Pakpoom Chaengphonak is at risk
of losing his title as his left wrist was swollen after the
semifinal bout. His rival will be Olympic silver medallist, Juan
Hernandez, who is 1.85 meters tall.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakpoom said he was not afraid of taking on him since
the Cuban is just quick.
</P>
<P>
"To me, his punches did not carry enough power," Pakpoom said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
introduced a special agricultural teaching program for 110 local
middle and primary schools which it is hoped will transform them
into "model schools" for learning such skills by September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, students in these schools will not only be
taught the usual curricula but receive training in farming
techniques so that, upon graduation, they will be able to become
qualified farmers.
</P>
<P>
The middle school students will have to master at least three
to five practical farm skills before they leave school while the
primary school pupils are expected to make use of at least one
farming skill upon their graduation.
</P>
<P>
Full-time or part-time teachers will be employed in these
schools to teach such skills which will include grain planting and
animal raising knowledge which will be particularly appropriate to
Tibet, a plateau land with an average elevation of over 3,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
Education officials have hailed the program as they say it will
help Tibetan students adapt themselves still more to the reality
of living in an agricultural environment.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Business Leaders Advocate Export of Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Major business leaders in Bangladesh
have advocated export of natural gas to the neighboring countries
to make money for investment in priority sectors, the Financial
Express newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Any natural resource unless converted into money is not a
resource, rather it's a liability," the newspaper Sunday quoted
Abdul Awal Mintoo, president of the Federation of Bangladesh
Chamber of Commerce and Industries, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We must export gas and make money to invest in priority
sectors," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The country had wasted a lot of time in taking decision on the
important issue, he said, adding "there should be no further delay
as the resource cannot remain as valuable as it is now to other
nations."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and several other donors have long been pressing
Bangladesh to export gas to earn foreign currency and invest the
surplus in priority sectors, after required payment for gas to the
foreign firms, already engaged or to be engaged in gas exploration
and extraction.
</P>
<P>
However, the government is yet to take a decision in this
regard, although negotiations with the petroleum companies are
continuing.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh did not have the capacity to pay for gas in foreign
currency, an official of the leading Beximco Group said. "We
should stop all negotiations with foreign companies unless we
agree to export gas."
</P>
<P>
There are two options remained for the government to exploit
the gas resources, A.K.M. Shamsuddin, president of the Foreign
Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry said, explaining that
firstly, it could export gas, and secondly, it could add value to
the resource by developing gas-based industries, like power and
fertilizer factories. "Whatever decision the government takes, it
should be taken immediately as we have already wasted 30 to 35
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader in the
parliament Khaleda Zia stated in March this year that the gas
reserves have not accurately been measured, and the country should
take a Bangladesh-first stand, arguing that the gas should be
firstly used to supply power to 85 percent of the country's 126
million people who still lack electricity.
</P>
<P>
Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed last month also
ruled out the possibility of exporting gas immediately, saying
that any decision on the matter would be taken after an assessment
of domestic demand as well as gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
The current estimate is that Bangladesh has a gas reserve of 30
to 40 trillion cubic feet including 13 trillion cubic feet already
discovered, according to a senior executive of a multinational oil
company.
</P>
<P>
With a gas field discovered recently at a "fault block" in the
country's northeastern district of Sylhet, the gas reserves will
perhaps be increased to 80 trillion cubic feet, press reports
said.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Ministers Call for Early National Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Some Sri Lankan ministers have
called for early parliamentary and presidential elections
following the ruling People's Alliance (PA)'s victory this week at
the Southern Provincial Council polls.
</P>
<P>
"Speculation was rife in political circles that the latest
victory will propel the government to advance election dates," the
private newspaper Sunday Island reported.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka President Chandrika Kumaratunga had reiterated during
her campaign in the south that the government will no seek early
national elections.
</P>
<P>
However, some ministers and key party officials believe that
the ruling coalition should advance both elections, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a minister as saying, "Better to face an early
presidential poll" as the main opposition United National Party
(UNP) will not be able to recover from the latest defeat, its
tenth defeat since August 1994 parliamentary poll.
</P>
<P>
Ministerial sources said that the government should go for an
early presidential election and destroy whatever hopes the UNP has
of challenging the PA at the next parliamentary election scheduled
for August next year. The presidential poll is scheduled for
November the same year.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that some ministers have proposed to hold
the national elections early next year.

ROME -- The adoption of the European single currency of euro
may lead to a rise in unemployment in countries like Italy which
uses a system of "ironclad" flat salaries which are not linked to
productivity, a report from the International Monetary Fund said
recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian news agency of ANSA, the IMF
dedicated two chapters to Italy and Spain in its new report,
Prospects for Regional Unemployment in Europe, which argued that "
with monetary union the salaries paid in the various countries
will be easily comparable and this could lead to pressures to
level them out."
</P>
<P>
"But there is also the risk that, with level salaries but
different productivity levels, unemployment will rise in those
nations which are less productive," added the report.

from a "inefficient and immobile" job market. (Italy-IMF-

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- Three major international investment risk
rating firms have warned that Colombia is in dire economic and
financial straits, the local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Standard and Poors (S&AMP;P), one of the main credit risk rankers,
negatived Friday its long-term outlook for the Colombian debt,
because of the economic problems triggered by the delayed arrival
of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P decision came after another ranking firm, Moody's
Investors Service (MIS), had put under revision the ranking of the
Colombian debt for a possible reduction.
</P>
<P>
The MIS cited the nation's 35-year civil conflict and its
growing economic costs, including a recent surge in military
spending, as reasons for the downgrade, which is likely to
increase borrowing costs abroad.
</P>
<P>
In its turn, Duff &AMP; Phelps ratified its good qualification for
the country, but first warned that the government must deepen the
adjustment of public finances.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis and the panorama of an uncertain peace
process could make Colombia lose the privileged credit risk it has
maintained since 1993, one of the best in Latin America, together
with Chile and Uruguay, said analysts. (Colombia-Credit Risk)

LA PAZ -- Bolivia suspended on Saturday imports of Belgian

Cuentas said that preventive measure will allow time for the
Health Laboratories of the National Institute to collect
information and carry out "an epidemiology watch" of foodstuffs
imported from Belgium, where meat and dairy products have been
tainted by cancer-causing dioxin.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to prevent public panic after Brazil, Chile,
Venezuela, Uruguay and other Latin American countries have taken
similar decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local epidemiology experts have recommended that
residents consume vegetables and cereals, instead of meat and
dairy products, since no laboratory in Bolivia has the capability
to identify dioxin.

increase by some 2 percent on last year, despite a shrinkage of
the area under cultivation this year, according to today's China

increases in grain yields over the past few years," the China

</P>
<P>
Xian Zude, deputy director-general of the Rural Survey
Organization of the bureau, noted that moist weather in major
wheat growing areas is generating optimism about the summer
harvest.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it is difficult to foresee any improvement in
farmers' income during the first half of this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oil Company Withdraws From Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. oil company is withdrawing
from Bangladesh completely this month, most probably without
paying compensation to Dhaka for a well explosion two years ago
seriously damaging the environment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. oil company Occidental, which will leave this South Asian
nation completely selling all its concerns to the Unocal, another
U.S. oil company, officially informed Petrobangla, which is in
charge of the oil and gas exploration and production in the
country, about its withdrawal from the country last week, a
front-paged report in The Daily Star newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two companies earlier this month unofficially
informed top officials of the Energy Ministry and Petrobangla
about their deal, but the government has not made any query about
the 6.12 billion taka (about 126.2 million U.S. dollars)
compensation claim, sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Magaurchhara exploratory well blow-out, in northeastern
Habiganj district, took place some two years ago on the night of
June 14, 1997. The massive fire of the well was put out after
months of efforts, and the well was sealed.
</P>
<P>
The fire raged everything there, killing wildlife and
destroying the eco-system which according to studies would take 50
years to regenerate, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Occidental, which was drilling a well there, was blamed for
negligence in its operation, choosing a drilling site that was too
close to road and rail links and making a weak and unstable
drilling well.
</P>
<P>
Petrobangla experts unofficially calculated that the explosion
had damaged a gas structure worth at least 200 million dollars,
but there was no official assessment of the sub-soil damage.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association later made an
environmental damage assessment, and based on the assessment, the
government said, to restore the environmental loss, it would
require a compensation for reforestation of 6.12 billion taka, to
be paid over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The Occidental said the claim was not based on facts and a
joint study by experts from the government and the company should
be undertaken to "properly" assess the environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
But the government so far has made no move to form such as
committee. "The government did not even bother to discuss the
issue with the Occidental," a source said.
</P>
<P>
"Typically, when an oil company having such a disputable
pending issue as the Magurchhara compensation claim withdraws from
a country, the government of the country intervenes," the source
said, "and if necessary, the government delays the withdrawal
procedure of the company until a concrete understanding is
reached."
</P>
<P>
It is understood that along with Occidental's local assets the
Unocal would be taking over the liabilities as well, the report
said. "But the government should have a clear picture. This is
official business and there is no room for ambiguity or guess
work," the source added.
</P>
<P>
Mosharraf Hossain, chairman of the Petrobangla, told a
roundtable discussion on energy exploration last week that the
Occidental had paid "some compensation" for damages to rail tracks
and roads, but not for damages to the environment, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Taxation Administration Guards Enterprises Against Double Taxation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Taxation (SAT) will continue to protect and support overseas
businesses of Chinese enterprises by strengthening their
protection against double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of an increasingly globalized economy,
international investment has been on the rise. The prevention of
duplicate taxation in both the country of investment and the
investor's home country in an indispensable issue for
international businesses.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the rising overseas investments by domestic
enterprises, the administration will continue its existing
policies to ensure that companies are not taxed twice for the same
overseas investment, said Chen Fuliang, deputy division chief of
the Income Tax Department of the administration.
</P>
<P>
Under current SAT regulations, income tax paid in the
registering country of the business may be offset against domestic
tax charges.
</P>
<P>
If a company fails to present evidence to prove that it has
been levied income tax in the foreign country, it will be taxed at
a rate of 16.5 percent, half the 33 percent rate of domestic
enterprise income tax.
</P>
<P>
Personal income taxpayers enjoy equivalent deduction of the
amount paid overseas from the domestic income tax computed under a
9-grade progressive system.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the complexity of international economic
relationships, it remains a Herculean task to steer entirely clear
of duplicate taxation, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Basketball Team Eyes Bronze Medal at SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Basketball Association
(Perbasi) chairman Sutiyoso is optimistic that his players can win
at least a bronze medal at the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in
Brunei in August.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the training center recently, Sutiyoso
predicted the team would do better than its fourth-place finish at
the last Games two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Although we only have had two months' preparation, compared to
nearly a year two years ago, it doesn't mean our players will be
worse," Sutiyoso was quoted by The Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sutiyoso, who is also Jakarta governor, said the current team
boasted stronger technical skills and better physiques.
</P>
<P>
Perbasi has been grooming 15 players who will be selected to
set up a nucleus team of 12.
</P>
<P>
Perbasi also plans psychological testing of players.
</P>
<P>
"If there are any players with psychological problems, we'll
give them professional help. Hopefully, we won't have other
obstacles. We hope our players are highly motivated to win the
matches," Sutiyoso said.
</P>
<P>
Perbasi does not plan to hire a foreign coach, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as chairman of the Indonesian Shooting and
Hunting Association (Perbakin), Sutiyoso said three women's double
trap athletes also were being groomed for the event, to be held
from August 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
"We expect help from the National Sports Council to assist
Perbakin to
finance the training because we don't have enough budget to buy
bullets and clay targets," he added.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Given Lower Rating in Credit Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Three major
international investment risk rating firms have warned that
Colombia is in dire economic and financial straits, the local
media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Standard and Poors (S&AMP;P), one of the main credit risk rankers,
negatived Friday its long-term outlook for the Colombian debt,
because of the economic problems triggered by the delayed arrival
of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P decision came after another ranking firm, Moody's
Investors Service (MIS), had put under revision the ranking of the
Colombian debt for a possible reduction.
</P>
<P>
The MIS cited the nation's 35-year civil conflict and its
growing economic costs, including a recent surge in military
spending, as reasons for the downgrade, which is likely to
increase borrowing costs abroad.
</P>
<P>
In its turn, Duff &AMP; Phelps ratified its good qualification for
the country, but first warned that the government must deepen the
adjustment of public finances.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis and the panorama of an uncertain peace
process could make Colombia lose the privileged credit risk it has
maintained since 1993, one of the best in Latin America, together
with Chile and Uruguay, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government reaffirmed its commitment to
structural reforms, cleaning up of the financial system and to the
peace process, the Finance Ministry said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The government is optimistic, despite the ranking firms'
announcements. The financial and budget programs the government
is implementing will be successful, and "in a few months S&AMP;P will
have what is needed to return Colombia's ranking to a stable
perspective," said Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
However, Chairman of the National Association of Financial
Institutions (ANIF), Armando Montenegro, said he is "pessimistic
about the future of the investment rankings."
</P>
<P>
"The fronts of violence, budget deficit and the financial
sector are very much damaged," he said.

</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, only those cinemas that have been approved by the
cultural administration departments will use the network at the

<HEADLINE> Bolivia Bans Imports of Belgian Meat, Dairy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LA PAZ, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Bolivia suspended on Saturday
imports of Belgian meat and dairy products for the following 45
days, Health Minister Guillermo Cuentas said.
</P>
<P>
Cuentas said that preventive measure will allow time for the
Health Laboratories of the National Institute to collect
information and carry out "an epidemiology watch" of foodstuffs
imported from Belgium, where meat and dairy products have been
tainted by cancer-causing dioxin.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to prevent public panic after Brazil, Chile,
Venezuela, Uruguay and other Latin American countries have taken
similar decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local epidemiology experts have recommended that
residents consume vegetables and cereals, instead of meat and
dairy products, since no laboratory in Bolivia has the capability
to identify dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bolivia imported from Belgium 217,000 dollars' worth
of powdered milk, milk cream and canned fruit, according to the La
Paz Chamber of Commerce.

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Prices to Fall as Yields Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's anticipated summer harvest,
of which the wheat crop will accounted for at least 85 percent, is
likely to increase by some 2 percent on last year, despite a
shrinkage of the area under cultivation this year, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Grain retail prices are set to go down under the pressure and
the stockpile of State grain reserves built up by the consecutive
increases in grain yields over the past few years," the China
Daily Business Weekly quoted a senior official from the National
Bureau of Statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
Xian Zude, deputy director-general of the Rural Survey
Organization of the bureau, noted that moist weather in major
wheat growing areas is generating optimism about the summer
harvest.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it is difficult to foresee any improvement in
farmers' income during the first half of this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xinmin, senior statistician and former director of the
organization, also warned that the government should not be
optimistic about the agriculture situation this year.
</P>
<P>
"This autumn agriculture may suffer a setback as compared with
last year," he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that falling pork and grain prices are not
good signs for either the grain yields or the output of the animal
husbandry sector this fall.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and international grain dealers are worried about
bumper crops adding already ample inventories. International and
domestic wheat futures are already pressured by solid spring wheat
plantings and expectations of early harvesting of the winter wheat
crop.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ruling Party Acknowledges Loss in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ruling party Golkar
has acknowledged its loss in the June 7 general election, local
leading newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We lost," said Marzuki Darusman, co-chairman of the Golkar
Party, which acted as the pillar of support for former president
Soeharto and always won landslide victories in the past six
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto quit last year amid the country's worst political and
economic crisis, opening the way for democratic reforms under his
successor President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
Darusman made the statement Saturday evening at the Joint
Operation Media Center in central Jakarta. He said his party has
lost according to vote counting conducted by Golkar itself.
</P>
<P>
According to official Antara News Agency, a total of 73,119,168
votes (62.90 percent) out of the 116,254,217 registered votes have
been counted as of 08:00 local time (0100 GMT) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The provisional results reported by Antara showed the
Indonesian Democratic party of Struggle (PDI-P) was still leading
with 24,333,985 votes or 33.28 percent of the votes counted,
followed by ruling Golkar with 15,911,494 votes (21.76 percent),
the National Awakening Party (PKB) 10,691,602 votes (14.62
percent), the United Development Party (PPP) 7,550,199 votes
(10.33 percent) and the National Mandate Party (PAN) 5,197,105
votes (7.11 percent).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Golkar General Chairman Akbar Tanjung said, "I'm
quite happy" with the result. Even though it has lost credibility,
Golkar was certain to retain a powerful role in the 500-seat
parliament and was open to allying with other parties, Golkar
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Golkar says it has adopted a pro-reform stance and nominated
Habibie as its presidential candidate. But Golkar would be willing
to discuss other potential candidates in coalition talks with
other parties, Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
The PDI-P and PKB have not made any official comments on the
election results, they said they would not make any deals until
more votes had been counted.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties took part in the election to
compete for 462 out of the 500 seats in the House of
Representatives (DPR). The remaining 38 seats are reserved for the
military, whose members do not vote.

<HEADLINE> China's Stock Market Gets Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A string of measures taken
recently by the government indicates that China's fledgling stock
market has been given higher priority, said Chinese market
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Detailing the aim of China's recent interest rate cut, an
official with the People's Bank of China is quoted as saying that
one of the targets was to "push the healthy development of the
capital market".
</P>
<P>
The central bank on Wednesday announced hefty interest rate
cuts. Deposit interest rates were slashed by an average 1
percentage point and lending rate were reduced by an average 0.75
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
It said that it expected the interest rate cut to encourage
individuals to "adjust the structure of their financial assets".
</P>
<P>
"It is really remarkable and it indicates the government is
paying more attention to the market," said Dong Chen, a financial
policy analyst with the China Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the stock market is hoped to play a
bigger role than in the past in assisting Chinese enterprise
reform and their struggle to survive falling prices.
</P>
<P>
A brisk market is also regarded as a positive factor for the
consumer market. Lucrative returns for stock investors are
expected to make them more willing to spend money, he said.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has witnessed an improved sentiment, which has
pushed indices to successive highs for the year. Daily transaction
swelled from just a few billion yuan to dozens of billions.
Individuals have begun switching part of their money from banks to
stock trading accounts.
</P>
<P>
Market sources said that the government may take more steps to
cheer up the market by approving the capital expansion plans of
more brokerages and permitting a few B-share companies to buy back
their issues to support their share prices.

<HEADLINE> More Ancient Tombs Unearthed in Chengdu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Archeological workers have found
seven tombs dating back to the Warring States period (475 B.C.-
221 B.C.) and six to the Song dynasty (960 - 1279 A.D.) at a
building site in the capital city of southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Inside the tombs were a host of pottery and bronze articles.
The Warring States tombs are earthen tombs while the Song tombs
were brick built.
</P>
<P>
In mid May, 14 tombs dating back to the Tang dynasty (618 - 907
A.D.) were unearthed, also in the city.
</P>
<P>
Five ancient sites with a history of 4,000 to 5,000 years have
been found around the city in the last year.
</P>
<P>
"The finds prove that the city of Chengdu has a very old
history and human beings settled there more than 4,000 years ago,"
said Wang Yi, an archeologist in Chengdu.

<HEADLINE> Pak Urges India to Stop Air Strikes to Pave Way for Better Atmosphere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday proposed India
to halt air strikes and artillery duels as a step towards
de-escalation of the latest tension in the disputed Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
"I have made some specific suggestions which included stoppage
of all air actions and artillery exchanges across the Line of
Control (LoC)," Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said here late
Saturday night upon his arrival from New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made a one-day visit to India Saturday in a bid to defuse
the tensions along the LoC. During his stay in New Delhi, Aziz
held talks with his Indian counterpart aswant Singh and called on
India's caretaker Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told the media here that India insisted on the withdrawal
of so-called infiltrators from the Kargil heights on the LoC. "We
told them our assessment does not tally with theirs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said these issues need to be discussed in a better
atmosphere. "But they have spoiled the atmosphere and have
escalated too much and they have to de-escalate the situation,"
the foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
"If they stop their air actions, then atmosphere can be
conducive for discussing the problem," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that during his meetings with both Singh and
Vajpayee, they had "a frank and useful discussion" and exchanged
views on how best to defuse the current situation and restore the
spirit of the Lahore Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he had made some specific suggestions,
and that the Indian government will give consideration to them so
that the talks may be carried forward.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our many differences, it is our belief that they can
only be resolved through peaceful discussions based on mutual
respect for each other's concerns. They cannot be resolved by
unilateral demands, unfounded allegations or the escalation of
tensions," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He also said that both Pakistan and India "have a huge stake in
restoring the Lahore Spirit and moving towards a new era in our
relations in accordance with the wishes of our peoples."
</P>
<P>
"This cannot happen by whipping up warlike hysteria and hatred
against each other or through threats and coercion. Mutual trust
must be based on mutual respect," he added.
</P>
<P>
It may not be expected that the current difficulties could be
resolved in day's visit, said Aziz, adding that "but I refuse to
be pessimistic."
</P>
<P>
He believed that the suggestions he had conveyed to the Indian
leadership will be duly considered and will help bring about an
atmosphere conducive to the defusing of the present tensions and
the restoration of the dialogue process as envisaged by the Lahore
Declaration.

<HEADLINE> Pagers Seek Salvation Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's paging business is turning
to the Internet to survive the squeeze from the expansion of
mobile phone communication.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 60 million pager users in China, but the
popularity of mobile phones has outstripped pagers and begun to
crunch into pager profit margins, according to an official from
the Ministry of Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
The number of mobile phone users grew by 11.3 percent last year
to 24.98 million. "The impact of mobile phones is compelling and
we must find alternative ways to reshape our paging business,"
said Yang Jun, general manager of the China Motion Telecom
Development Co, one of the country's leading paging operators.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the paging center, pager users can access
their e-mail information and special web news without dialing up
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Telecom experts say paging operators should take advantage of
their large pool of clients and make use of the Internet to
provide convenient services to ease people's daily lives.
</P>
<P>
However, limited room for Internet applications in China has
slowed their pace of investment in such developments.

ministry announced Saturday that leptospirosis has increased in
the country in the last three years.

Experts said that animals are the main source of the
leptospirosis contagion.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's North Sulawesi Province to Rehold Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's North Sulawesi
provincial election committee Saturday decided to rehold the polls
on the grounds that the June 7 general election was marred by vote
buying and intimidation by officials from the government and
ruling Golkar Party.
</P>
<P>
According to The Jakarta Post Sunday, the dramatic decision
came in a tense meeting when the majority of the committee's
members -- consisting of representatives of the 48 political
parties contesting the polls and the government -- voted for
repolling.
</P>
<P>
Golkar and government representatives objected to the motion
but were forced to accede to the majority vote.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Election Committee Chairman F. Sumampouw said he
hoped the National Election Committee in Jakarta would endorse the
wish of the majority in North Sulawesi to allow the vote to be
rescheduled soon.
</P>
<P>
Golkar, which reportedly received strong backing from the local
government bureaucracy, is ahead in the provisional vote
tabulation in the province.
</P>
<P>
It has been accused of vote buying and using government and
military officials in its campaign. Government representative on
the committee Abdullah acknowledged that cases of rigging may have
occurred, but believed they were blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two districts in Central Java and West Sumatera also
called for the vote to be repeated due to alleged vote rigging by
Golkar and government officials.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties took part in the election on June
7 to compete for 462 out of the 500 seats in the House of
Representatives (DPR). The other 38 seats have been allotted for
the military, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
According to data collected by official Antara News Agency, the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) was still leading
in the collection of votes until Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
PDI-P gathered 24.3 million votes or 33.28 percent of the votes
counted until Sunday morning, followed by Golkar 15.9 million
votes (21.76 percent), the National Awakening Party (PKB) 10.69
million votes (14.62 percent), the United Development Party (PPP)
7.55 million votes (10.33 percent) and the National Mandate Party
(PAN) 5.197 million votes (7.11 percent).

<HEADLINE> Kuwait not to Attend Pan Arab Games: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti sports official
reiterated on Saturday that his country will not take part in the
Ninth Pan Arab Games due to be held in Amman, Jordan next August
because of Iraq's participation.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait will not take part in any sports competitions with
teams of the Iraqi regime," Chairman of the Kuwait Olympic
Committee (KOC) Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahd Al-Sabah told a joint press
conference with visiting Jordanian Minister of Youth and Sports
Mohammad Mamser.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad said the decision was not a political one, insisting it "
reflects the will of the Kuwaiti people."
</P>
<P>
He said there have been no direct Iraqi-Kuwaiti meetings since
the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991,
especially in the sports field.
</P>
<P>
The official said he had sent a letter to the head of the
organizing committee of the tournament, Faisal Bin Al-Hussein, to
explain the Kuwaiti position.
</P>
<P>
The KOC and other Kuwaiti sports officials announced last month
that Kuwait would boycott the Arab tournament in Iraq's presence.
</P>
<P>
Mamser, who arrived here on Friday in a bid to persuade Kuwait
to change its position, said he was still optimistic that all Arab
countries will participate in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
He voiced understanding and respect over the Kuwaiti stand but
said he could "not decide the non participation of the Iraqi teams,
" adding that "is not part of Jordan's competence."
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian official will continue his three-nation tour in
Sudan and Egypt in preparations for the games.

NEW DELHI -- No headway has been achieved in the foreign
minister-level talks held here Saturday between India and Pakistan
over the Kashmir crisis, official sources said here.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan remained deadlocked in the talks between
foreign ministers of India and Pakistan, Jaswant Singh and Sartaj
Aziz, as the two sides were widely divided over the issue of the
Line of Control (LOC) in the Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
Singh said in the talks that the LOC was well-defined and well-
delineated on authentic maps signed by military authorities of
both countries while Aziz stuck to the stand that the LOC was
delineated on paper but not clearly demarcated on the ground,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
India urged Pakistan to "vacate its armed intrusion and
aggression from across the LOC in Kargil," saying defusing of the
crisis in Kargil would be possible only by restoring the status
quo along the LOC without further loss of time. (India-Pakistan-
FM Talks)

MOSCOW -- Talks here between Russia and the United States on
Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo again became deadlocked
Saturday as Moscow accuses the U.S. side of taking "a sticky
unproductive position."
</P>
<P>
One Russian negotiator said U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott "heed none of the plans, offered by the Russian
delegation to deploy Russian peace-keepers in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"In the atmosphere of the talks itself, neglect is felt for
the interests of Russia, which by its actions has won the right
for presence in Kosovo. The impression is that the American side
is trying to usurp the right to its own exclusive presence in the
region, leaving a secondary role for Russia," the Interfax news
agency quoted the unidentified negotiator as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
said Saturday's round of talks between Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and Talbott, which lasted for an hour and a half and
was "business-like, aiming at concrete results," are likely to
resume Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The talks followed the entry into Kosovo by some 200 Russian
troops in the early hours of Saturday, a move Ivanov said was an
unfortunate mistake and that orders had been given for them to
pull out. (Russia-US-Talks)

MOSCOW -- Russia's General Staff has begun drafting plans for
a large-scale strategic staff exercise on instructions from the
top political leadership, the Itar-Tass news agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will involve three military districts and one of
the Russian fleets, as well as Belarus' armed forces, Tass said,
quoting an official with the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The official said some structures of the General Staff,
including the Main Operations Directorate, will be working at full
throttle to fulfill the tasks assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
He did not say when the order was received to begin
preparations for the exercise and whether it was in connection
with the situation in Yugoslavia, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Russian paratroopers are stationed in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo now, but talks between Russia and the United
States on Moscow's peacekeeping role there were stalled.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been pressing for its own sector in Kosovo and
being under its own command, while NATO says the peacekeeping
operation must be under a unified command and control system.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-U.S. talks in Moscow, on and off for several days,
are expected to resume Sunday. (Russia-Army-Exercise)

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Saturday
that the United States looked forward to working with Russia as a
peacekeeping force in Kosovo despite Russia's opposition against
NATO's bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a commencement speech at the University of Chicago,
Clinton said while the Russians may not have agreed with NATO's
air campaign against Yugoslavia, they "do agree with the
proposition that all the people of that tiny land (Kosovo) - Serb
and Albanian alike - should be able to live in peace and dignity."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Clinton was scheduled to speak with Russian
president Boris Yeltsin by telephone to discuss the confusion over
the deployment of Russian troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, about 200 Russian soldiers in trucks and
personnel carriers entered the Kosovo capital of Pristina hours
before NATO troops crossed into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The deployment, which took place before the role of the
Russian troops had been worked out, took the United States and its
NATO allies by surprise.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen called the situation confusing
but ultimately hopeful _ a sign that Russians are eager to help
out and an opportunity for NATO and Russia to reprise a successful
joint peacekeeping operation next door in Bosnia. (Clinton-Kosovo-

<HEADLINE> IMF Says Euro May Increase Unemployment in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The adoption of the European single
currency of euro may lead to a rise in unemployment in countries
like Italy which uses a system of "ironclad" flat salaries which
are not linked to productivity, a report from the International
Monetary Fund said recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian news agency of ANSA, the IMF dedicated
two chapters to Italy and Spain in its new report, Prospects for
Regional Unemployment in Europe, which argued that "with monetary
union the salaries paid in the various countries will be easily
comparable and this could lead to pressures to level them out."
</P>
<P>
"But there is also the risk that, with level salaries but
different productivity levels, unemployment will rise in those
nations which are less productive," added the report.
</P>
<P>
The IMF went on to single out Italy which it claimed suffered
from a "inefficient and immobile" job market.
</P>
<P>
"The regional fragmentation of the job market," the report
observed, "remains one of the main sources for the inefficiency of
the Italian economy, in order to stimulate productive investments,
Italy should reform its public administration and improve
infrastructures, especially in the south."
</P>
<P>
According to IMF experts, "a more incisive measure would be the
reconstruction of the system of contract salaries" which
introduced "diversities on a regional level that reflect the
different levels of productivity."
</P>
<P>
The IMF also pointed out that salaries were too rigid in the
various productive sectors and thus further reduced mobility for
Italian workers.
</P>
<P>
Under present conditions, the report said, when there is a
serious crisis in one sector or large company, Italy's ability to
absorb and reduce the resulting employment shock is greatly
reduced.

<HEADLINE> Italy Says No Independent Sectors for Peace Force in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops cannot be allowed to
control their own independent sector in Kosovo because the unified
command of the international peace force would suffer, Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia cannot have autonomous and independent sectors," he
told reporters in Italian northeast city of Venice, when he
attended the city's art biennial.
</P>
<P>
He said that the arrival of "a couple of hundred" Russian
troops in Pristina before NATO troops entered Kosovo from Albania
was due "overall, to a misunderstanding."
</P>
<P>
He added that, in his contacts, he found a "strong
determination" to clarify the episode and bring it back within
normality.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that the command should be held jointly by the United
States and Russia, which would permit a "general coordination
indispensable for the good functioning of the whole military
apparatus in Kosovo."
