AFTER BIG CAT BRAWL, DODGERS LOSE TO BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Darren Dreifort said he was fine, but the welts on his
body suggested otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   And Dreifort will never say the pitch that hit Andres Galarraga
in the left thigh and touched off a bench-clearing brawl in the
second inning of Saturday's 7-5 Dodgers loss to the Atlanta Braves
was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   But Braves manager Bobby Cox doesn't care. He knows what he saw
and it looked a lot like last Sunday's game in Los Angeles, when
Dreifort hit Galarraga in almost the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very intentional, no doubt about it,'' the usually
soft-spoken Cox shouted after the game. ``You had an idiot on the
mound today. The guy is a dope.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was cheap, weak and selfish on his part. He is
baseball's biggest dope.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong words but not nearly as powerful as the swing that flew
over the head of Dreifort after Galarraga charged the mound.
Dreifort dropped to the ground to avoid the 6-foot-4, 250-pound
Galarraga, who said earlier in the week he would no longer stand by
as pitchers tried to drive him off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   There were strong emotions on both sides as the brawl lasted
several minutes. Dreifort and Galarraga, who were ejected by
home-plate umpire Bruce Froemming, wrestled on the mound before
they were joined by teammates. Galarraga raised a sweat. Dreifort
looked like a rag doll.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see this was coming after the Big Cat (Galarraga)
got hit in L.A.,'' said Dodgers second baseman Eric Young, a former
teammate in Colorado. ``It takes a lot to get him this way. But
he's been hit a lot this season and I think he is taking it
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga has been hit 22 times this season, a club record, and
134 times in his career, more than any active player. Sunday, he
was struck by Dreifort in the second inning after hitting
game-winning, three-run homers the two previous previous days. He
now has 39 homers, but that power has come at a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy stands right on top of the plate,'' Dreifort said.
``His back foot is almost on the plate. He dives over the plateevery time. You have to go inside or he will kill you.'' That was
Galarraga's intent when he charged Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time he did it (last Sunday) I turned away,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he is throwing at me on purpose. If I didn't
charge the mound, everybody in baseball would have been laughing at
me. I had to defend myself. I wanted to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's pitch incited the brawl, but it also ignited a
three-run rally that gave the Braves a lead they would never lose.
</P>
<P>
   After sweeping Florida, the Dodgers were guardedly optimistic
they were heading in the right direction. Now they are facing Cy
Young Award winners Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine in the final two
games of the series. Talk about frightening.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers missed both last weekend when they dropped two of
three to the Braves. Their only victory came in a pitcher's duel
between Dreifort and left-hander Denny Neagle. This time, Dreifort
was gone after 13 pitches and Neagle (12-11) struggled through five
before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers battled, scoring three in the fourth. Braves third
baseman Chipper Jones homered in the third off right-hander Mike
Judd, who took over when Dreifort was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre, who had a single and game-winning homer Friday
night in Miami, had a two-run single in the inning to get the
Dodgers within 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was anything good about this game, it was that we got
to see some guys that don't play much,'' said Hoffman, who also got
two innings out of recent call-up Sean Maloney. ``That will help
them down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams batted for Ryan Kelsko against Mark Guthrie in
the fifth and increased the Braves' lead to 6-3 with a two-run
single. Trenidad Hubbard and Raul Mondesi against made it a one-run
game with RBI singles in the sixth, but the Dodgers never got any
closer.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Dodgers eight games behind the New York
Mets in the wild- card race. Former Dodger Mike Piazza hit a grand
slam for the Mets, who come to Los Angeles next weekend for a
four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be in a position to have to win all those
games,'' Hoffman said. ``It would be good to win here and show how
we match up against the top teams. It is going to be tough the next
two days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had planned to go with a six-man rotation on the
upcoming homestand when right-hander Ismael Valdes was scheduled to
return. But Valdes lasted only three innings Saturday in a
minor-league rehabilitation assignment. Dreifort, with one-plus
inning Saturday, could be moved up in the rotation, but Hoffman
wasn't thinking about that after facing the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been a disaster today,'' he said. ``When I saw
Galarraga charge the mound, I was very worried Darren could have
really been hurt.''

COVENANT MARRIAGE LAW LURES COUPLES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have already promised God to love, honor and cherish.
</P>
<P>
   But about 75 married couples wanted to find out Saturday how to
get the state of Arizona involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before God, we're vowed. We've already made the commitment
that divorce is not an option,'' said 35-year-old Kim Schmidt,
standing next to her 34-year-old husband, Marc. ``We want to make
that promise on paper, before the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schmidts, who've been married 15 years, were among the
information seekers who attended a seminar at the downtown Hyatt in
Phoenix on Arizona's new covenant marriage law.
</P>
<P>
   The law, the second of its kind in the nation, makes it harder
to obtain a divorce. It took effect on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this public statement can encourage (other couples) to
work a little harder on that relationship,'' Marc Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   A covenant marriage puts legal limits on the grounds for
divorce. It says husband and wife must live apart for two years
before they can legally split.
</P>
<P>
   It says a spouse may try to leave the relationship only if there
has been
</P>
<P>
   adultery, abuse, abandonment, alcoholism or drug abuse, or if a
spouse has been sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   A covenant marriage can also end if both people agree to the
divorce, the law says.
</P>
<P>
   Couples-to-be who want a covenant marriage must agree to
premarital counseling. But those already married the traditional
way, who want to marry under the covenant, can forgo the
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   They do need to pay the $50 fee, however.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Leo Godzich said covenant couples will be a shining
example of
</P>
<P>
   commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the covenant movement starts spreading to other states,
couples will be confronted with the word `covenant' and what a
marriage means,'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and Louisiana are the only states with covenant marriage
laws. This year, 19 states tried and failed to pass covenant
legislation, said Len Munsil, an attorney and covenant advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reaction against the system we have today whereby a
person can leave a marriage at any time for any reason, or no
reason at all,'' Munsil said.
</P>
<P>
   The first couple to be married under the new law are Gail and
Jean Michelli.
</P>
<P>
   They had been married for 30 years until Jean got tired of the
marriage and asked for a divorce. He then remarried and divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the couple are back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disobedient. I chose not to honor the commitment we
made,'' Jean Michelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Jean said the two-year waiting period would have been enough for
him to realize the marriage needed counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Couples) think of it as a game,'' Gail Michelli said. ``It's
not a game.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 16,736 divorces in Maricopa County last year. Half
the marriages in Arizona end in divorce, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Mark and Nancy Steele, who have been married four years, said
their marriage is already a covenant. They attended the session,
but said they wonder if the new state law is worth the paperwork
and the $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, in our plain-vanilla marriage, we entered into it
until death do we part,'' Mark Steele said. ``We're happily
married. And, I say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' &QL;

COPPING TO CAPITOL OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
It's clear now that, sooner or later, you'll catch on. Maybe you'll
be downtown, looking west toward the Washington Monument, and see
only a saguaro.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Or you'll be on the east side, where the Capitol dome should
dominate the skyline _ not the dome of a thunder cloud boiling over
an unbroken horizon.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll begin to wonder if you've been betrayed. To sense
you've been double crossed. To suspect you've been sold down the
river, which you suddenly notice is dry, because it's not the
Potomac, it's the Salt.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll know _ in spite of this newspaper's distortions and
deceptions _ you DO NOT live in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   You live in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   (Or maybe Cleveland, Miami, Portland, Pittsburgh, Chicago, San
Francisco and so on.)
</P>
<P>
   You'd never have been able to tell from reading the local news
or watching TV, not for the past week or so.
</P>
<P>
   But take a look outside.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a pool in your back yard, but it's small and
kidney-shaped, and reflects a barbecue grill, not an obelisk.
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't cherry trees lining the streets, either. They're
palms.
</P>
<P>
   And the famous Mall?
</P>
<P>
   It's . . . a mall.
</P>
<P>
   No Air &AMP; Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap. &QL; 
CONFESSION TIME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The time has come for those of us in the news business to fess
up.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since President Clinton made his historic confession, we've
been deceiving you, acting as if every city in America was Washing
ton, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   There's no White House here.
</P>
<P>
   There are White Mountains, but they're a day's drive away. And
much more pristine.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say what led us to do what we did, filling page after
page with news from the nation's capital. It was, as a powerful and
embarrassed man once said, ``a critical lapse in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, no sensible journalist would dally with Washington in
lieu of Phoenix. No more so than he'd choose a naive intern over a
smart, challenging professional woman.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it happened.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the past several days arrogantly trying to gauge
political winds from the East, ignoring the damp breeze swirling
north from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Each afternoon, monsoon winds herd rain clouds into bunches at
the outskirts of town, near the mountain tops. That's where they
stay most days, the setting sun toasting their underbellies like
marshmallows. &QL; 
SHAME TO WASTE IT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such things go unnoticed in Washington, where everyone is too
busy looking down on everyone else to look up at the sky.
</P>
<P>
   We've got an abundance of sky where we live. It's a shame to
waste it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame _ as we shine a light on the Capitol _ to ignore
the subtle shade of a paloverde tree.
</P>
<P>
   Or the slanting shadows on Cam elback Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Or the wavering heat on our wide city streets.
</P>
<P>
   There are wide thoroughfares in Washington, too. One difference
is, our streets lead home. In D.C., they lead to traffic circles,
where resi dents go round and round. News people from all over the
country were in there with them recently, spinning wildly, getting
dizzy and disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   But as a famous man once said while trying desperately to appear
contrite (though appearing only des perate), ``Now is the time _ in
fact, it is past time _ to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the jackals in the East chew the corpses they choose.
</P>
<P>
   I know it may be difficult for you to believe me, or anyone else
from this paper, given our recent indiscre tion, but you're NOT in
Washing ton.
</P>
<P>
   From the beautiful desert, we can study the carcasses at a safe
dis tance, well beyond the stench of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, open the window, take a deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   Ahhhhhhhhhh. &QL;

OFFENSE WAKES UP, BUT COWBOYS LOSE TO RAMS, 22-14
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ After weeks of stuttering and sputtering in Chan
Gailey's new offense, the Cowboys finally flexed their aging
muscles last night.
</P>
<P>
   It was circa 1995 for Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin, and Emmitt
Smith, who led a first-half Cowboys charge that bullied the St.
Louis Rams in exhibition football at the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams stayed with their starters throughout most of the third
quarter and rallied for a 22-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But when it was first team vs. first team, the Cowboys
dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman completed his first eight passes and finished 10-for-14.
Irvin caught six for 100 yards. Smith rushed 12 times for another
110.
</P>
<P>
   On their first two offensive series, the Cowboys marched 82 and
91 yards for touchdowns in drives that resembled the efficient way
the team used to play when it was considered a serious Super Bowl
contender.
</P>
<P>
   It was 14-0 Cowboys before the Rams had three first downs.
</P>
<P>
   When work was done for Aikman and company, the Cowboys, who also
got inspired play from a first-team defense playing without Leon
Lett and Deion Sanders, had outgained the Rams, 258-108. The total
included 141 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this was a Rams team coming off a 5-11 season. In
two previous exhibitions this year, they had been outscored by
three touchdowns. And because of a contract dispute, they were
without their best defensive player, cornerback Ryan McNeil, who
led the league with nine interceptions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But for a first-team Cowboys offense that had scored one
offensive touchdown in three previous preseason games, it was the
kind of confidence booster needed to continue preparing for the
Sept. 6 season opener against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we won't have to answer any more questions about it (how
they have struggled this summer). I think we have always been
confident in this offense. We just have not had the success in the
last couple of games,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and Gailey were quick to note that there is still room
for improvement. There were still too many breakdowns, most
prominently a missed block on a Rams blitz that led to an Aikman
interception, and a complete breakdown of the offensive line that
led to, for the second week in a row, a failed fourth-and-one
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The sloppiness handcuffed the Cowboys on their final three
drives of the first half, when they scored no points and had four
first downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only disappointments were not putting points on the board
after starting with good field position,'' Aikman said of a Cowboys
drive that began at their 49. ``And not being able to convert on
fourth-and-one. Overall, though, I was real pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   All summer, Gailey kept telling a disbelieving public that there
could be days like this, when the Cowboys coaches had a strong game
plan and the team kept its mistakes to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened during the first 16 minutes. There were no
penalties, and Gailey played to his strengths, with Aikman, Irvin,
and Smith accounting for most of the team's yardage in the first
two drives. Irvin easily beat the single coverage of cornerback
Dexter McCleon, McNeil's replacement, for most of his six catches,
including one for 46 yards. Smith had a 47-yard run behind a first
team offensive line that opened gaping holes all night, and scored
a touchdown on a 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when called upon, other Cowboys stepped up, especially Billy
Davis, who continues to make Gailey's job of choosing a No. 2 wide
receiver difficult. Davis kept the first Cowboys scoring drive
alive with a sliding reception on third down. And he ended it with
a sliding, 6-yard touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Cowboys' first team unit limited Rams
quarterback Tony Banks and company to six first downs and 34 yards
rushing in the first half. For the fourth consecutive week, the
first-team defensive line did not record a sack, but young
defensive ends Greg Ellis and Kavika Pittman combined for three
quarterback pressures on Banks. The pressure forced Banks into a
6-for-16 first half.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey does not plan to use his starters for much more than a
quarter in the preseason finale against Jacksonville next week. So
last night was the final dress rehearsal for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, the curtain comes up.

FINALLY, CHAN SEES PROGRESS, ALBEIT LIMITED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Better, yes. Much better, actually. But still not
good enough to cheer up Chan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We improved, and that was our goal, but I'm not satisfied,''
said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who might be in need of a real
quick crash course in realism.
</P>
<P>
   There is no coaching medicine to improve mediocrity, and until
further notice, that's where the Cowboys are stuck. So on an
evening when the good is much more prevalent than the awful, which
wcase here last night, go ahead, Chan, get yourself some
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this Trans World Dome visit, a trio of exhibition
season malfunctions for the Cowboys had ranked somewhere between
rot and reek. Therefore, it could be said the first 30 minutes
against the St. Louis Rams was a vast improvement over nothing, but
that misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   The how, who and why didn't necessarily matter. When the
Cowboys' starting units lined up against the Rams, it was
imperative that positives finally flow, particularly on the
offensive side.
</P>
<P>
   Locker room voices had indicated all week that the Cowboys were
even carrying a load of self-imposed pressure into this game, an
almost unheard of August admittance about it not being too early to
show concern.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, an ``old-school'' offense was on display, providing
some flashbacks to the way it was. The way it was a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt by land, Troy and Michael by air, ripping off yardage,
and, yes, a couple of touchdowns, as if Buffalo had just shown up
to play the Cowboys in that first Super Bowl of the '90s. Well, OK,
that's stretching it, but it's been a long and barren exhibition
season.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith, in particular, looked super sharp, not only
scooting through nice holes provided by the offensive line, but
also creating yardage on his own. The creating part has been
missing for Smith, but 110 yards on 12 carries in only one half was
Emmitt as good as he's been in a long time. Ditto for the offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin spent most of the first two
quarters playing uncontested pitch-and-catch, although in fairness,
Irvin was abusing a young, overmatched cornerback. Dexter McCleon
will be on the Rams bench if and when a solid corner named Ryan
McNeil decides to end a contractual holdout.
</P>
<P>
   In the two quarters the first unit offense was on the field,
Emmitt, Aikman and Michael accounted for 210 yards and led the way
to a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Just as telling, the offense played ball control, knocking 18
minutes off the clock in the first half. Nothing helps the Dallas
defense like not being on the field, which goes back to the key to
the dynasty success, speaking of another long-ago memory.
</P>
<P>
   Let it be noted, however, that the whipping boys of the defense,
ends Greg Ellis and Kavika Pittman, both had their most solid
performances of the preseason. In other words, they were noticed,
making tackles and chasing quarterback Tony Banks into hurried
throws.
</P>
<P>
   But just because positives easily out-totaled negatives _
finally _ in a preseason game, when the bad things did happen, they
were glaring.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a second-quarter screen pass.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is big on screen passes, but he may be finding out why
Norv Turner and Ernie Zampese weren't. Those things don't work for
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman tried to drop a screen over the middle, a play that
seemed to be going nowhere from the start. Unfortunately, the ball
was tipped, and also intercepted, giving the Rams their first lift
of the first half. Plus, the interception killed a possession for
Dallas that had started at midfield, and it led to a St. Louis
field goal. Screen passes _ who needs them?
</P>
<P>
   Later in the second quarter, the Cowboys were sitting on a
fourth-and-one from the Rams' 35. Emmitt went up the middle,
gaining nothing. Fourth-and-one? Yes, the Cowboys do need them, but
rarely convert anymore.
</P>
<P>
   So while the offense started against the Rams with a vast amount
of steam, as the first half wound down, the momentum was gone.
Thanks and no thanks to a busted screen pass and a futile
fourth-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gailey went to his bench in the second half. All that did
was ensure the Cowboys would remain winless in the preseason. Let
the record show St. Louis won, 22-14.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, give the Cowboys credit for a lot of first half
positives _ finally.

<P>
   He was injured all the time. He stopped hitting. He was an
erratic fielder. He was demoted to the minors. He was unwanted. He
was headed no where in a hurry. He was miserable.
</P>
<P>
   And then Damion Easley on July 31, 1996, escaped purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels traded him to the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely the low point of my life,'' says Easley, who grew
up in Long Beach. ``I had been an Angel fan ever since I was a kid.
I loved that team. And I came up with a lot of the players now
playing on it. A lot of them are still my close friends. I was a
part of that group. I didn't want to leave. But I knew I had
reached a point where, unless a few things changed, I would have to
go. I did. No regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding!
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley has developed in Detroit into the player the
Angels thought he would become in Anaheim when he arrived on the
scene in 1992 as a heralded prospect only to spend a good portion
of his time on the disabled list during the next four, frustrating,
unpve seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But it all has magically turned around for Easley.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer gets injured. He hits home runs. He drives in runs.
He keeps his batting average in the .290 range. He makes the
All-Star team. He appears in the event's home-run hitting contest
right alongside the Mark McGwires and Ken Griffeys. He earns
himself a three-year, multi-million dollar contract.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley has pulled off the unusual he's become a
legitimate major league star only a brief time after he seemed
destined for baseball oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things definitely have been going my way,'' said Easley the
other day in the visitors clubhouse at Edison Field before his team
faced the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   How could Damion Easley go from being a reject prone to ailments
to being a durable performer ranked among the top second basemen in
the major leagues?
</P>
<P>
   Well, for one thing, he credits the more than the 200, 45-minute
sessions he had with a Marina Del Rey hypnotherapist named Pete
Seagal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started them in 1995 to deal with some personal issues not
related to baseball,'' says Easley. ``And then it turned out the
hypnotherapy made me a stronger person, and it helped me in my
baseball career. I became more mature, and could handle adversity
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley also attributes weightlifting to his turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very inconsistent in taking care of myself physically
when I was with the Angels,'' admits Easley, who was plagued by
shin splits and shoulder injuries during his tenure with the team.
``Now I hit the weights after every game. I never miss a workout.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley has packed 15 muscular pounds on his 5-foot-11 frame
since departing the Angels, and he feels the extra strength in the
190 he now carries has resulted in his hitting 22 home runs last
season and already 21 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm much stronger now than when I was with the Angels,'' says
Easley. ``The drives I used to hit in the power alleys would go for
doubles or be caught. Now I have enough strength for them to reach
the stands. It's just a case of physical and mental maturity. I'm
now 28.''
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley no longer gets injured, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just take care of myself better,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you miss playing for the Angels?'' I asked Easley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it would be nice being part of a team involved in a
pennant race like the Angels,'' he said. ``But I'm very happy with
the Tigers. We're a young team, much like the Angels were a few
years back when I first joined them. We've got a lot of good young
players who are going to get a lot better. Hopefully, we'll all
stay together and have some good years in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley lives in the off-season in Glendale, Ariz., with his
wife, Dawn, and three children, Rocky, 9, Tazmin, 4, and Nathaniel,
2.
</P>
<P>
   He played at Long Beach City College in 1988, and signed with
the Angels the following year.
</P>
<P>
   He knows the Angels probably now regret getting rid of him, but
doesn't begrudge them for doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't producing and I was hurt a lot,'' he says. ``I
was frustrated, and I'm sure the Angels were frustrated. The change
of scenery definitely worked out well for me. I have no complaints.
None whatsoever.''

DRUG CZAR'S NEW PLAN FOR BORDER
</HEADLINE>
 WAR-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
WASHINGTON _ America's drug czar will soon propose sweep ing
remedies to try to patch gaping holes in the Southwest border,
where tons of cocaine and mari juana continue to slip through
undetected, even though the U.S. is spending $2 billion a year to
keep drugs out.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposals, the result of two years of study, will be
announced this week and will include putting a federal official in
charge of each of the 24 entry points and naming a coordinator to
oversee the entire 2,000-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the national drug control
officer (or ``drug czar''), is to curb interagency rivalries and to
put somebody in charge of the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, he says, the United States clamps down on one segment
of the border only to see smugglers retreat to a less-guarded area.
McCaffrey also wants to modernize inspection and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The druggies know where the holes are,'' said James McDonough,
McCaffrey's director of strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, despite the com mitment of 11,000 federal agents
and officials, the nation is still losing the battle of the border.
While there is no way of ensuring that his plan will help,
McCaffrey said that after two years of studying the drug battles at
the border, he is ready to try.
</P>
<P>
   The retired four-star general and former Persian Gulf War
division commander believes the United States suffers not only from
a shortage of border resources but also from a lack of coordination
among the federal agencies that police the border. They include the
Customs Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Na
tional Guard, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the
Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates that 60 percent of the cocaine and more
than half of the marijuana that enter the country each year cross
the Mexican border. The border also is an important gateway for
heroin and methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine seizures at the border have fallen from 41,840 kilos in
1995, to 35,608 kilos in 1996, to 17,383 kilos last year, according
to the drug czar's office.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's plan would clarify vague or duplicative assignments
and, in some key cases, establish entirely new responsibilities for
many of the 10 primary agencies operating along the border that
stretches from Brownsville, Texas, to San Ysidro, Calif. Arizona
has six entry points along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a federal official from one of the lead
agencies, most likely the U.S. Cus toms Service, would be placed in
charge at each of the ports _ all overseen by a newly created South
west border coordinator expected to be based at El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey hopes to win enough support from affected agencies so
he can send the recommendations to President Clinton by the fall.
Por tions of the plan would require congressional approval, and at
least one congressman from the South west is on board.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, a former Border Patrol
sector chief in El Paso, said a new approach is necessary because
``we have, in varying degrees, an uncoor dinated effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Border Patrol in the early 1970s when President
Nixon proposed a border manage ment agency,'' Reyes said. ``It was
not followed through on, and there was a tremendous amount of
resist ance by federal agencies. The differ ence now is that we
have a Cabinet-level official (McCaffrey) fully behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, no one monitors the entire border except President
Clin ton, ``and he has a full plate already,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar is to unveil his proposals during meetings Tuesday
and Wednesday with federal border officials in El Paso, one of the
nation's busiest ports. The Arizona Republic obtained details in ad
vance.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is at least partly formed from lessons derived from
military strategy. McDonough, like his boss, was a celebrated Army
officer.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough, who led troops in Vietnam, said lives were lost when
the service branches could not successfully integrate missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the military learned, it is better to coordinate its
separate services and arms,'' he said. ``So, too, can we learn to
coordinate at the border.''
</P>
<P>
   At most ports, even the most fundamental task of inspecting cars
and trucks is divided among agen cies with different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   At Nogales, for example, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service routinely inspects vehicles lined up in half of the lanes
approaching the Arizona border. The Customs Service handles the
other half. The split evolved be cause of the border's dual mission
of uncovering both illegal drugs and undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spotters'' use binoculars to survey the entire scene from the
Mexican side, then report back to drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sit on a hill overlooking the cargo (inspection)
operation,'' said P.T. Wright, customs director for the Nogales
port. ``They have a little picnic under the mesquite trees. We feel
like they're looking primarily at which trucks we're sending in for
(extra) examination.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials in the drug czar's office fear that the spotters
also may be looking for any differences they can exploit in the
respective agen cies' inspection procedures.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's plan would, for the first time, mandate standard,
border wide procedures for inspecting vehi cles for drugs. He wants
little variation from port to port or agency to agency, to prevent
spot ters from detecting an opening.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also would officially declare the federal Border Patrol
as the lead agency for the vast sections of border between the
ports _ including areas so remote that McCaffrey describes them as
``an invisible line in the sand.'' Cur rently, Border Patrol agents
share the in-between areas with other agencies and local
authorities from Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Border Patrol virtually de facto has that lead now, but
they can't claim they've got ad, and they don't have all the
authority that would come with it,'' said Chuck Blanchard, chief
counsel in McCaffrey's office and a former Arizona state senator.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey believes his plan could reduce the flow of drugs over
the border by 80 percent in the next 10 years. Accomplishing that
would require not only the organizational fixes but also
cooperation with Mexico and increased funding by Congress for
drug-screening equip ment and new border agents. None of those
propositions is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Because McCaffrey hasn't for mally presented his recommenda
tions, federal agencies were reluctant to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly aware of his proposal that's being
discussed,'' said Roger Maier, a Customs Serv ice spokesman on the
border. ``But I don't think we have all the details of what he's
proposing, and until we do, we really can't comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Maier noted that the volume of cocaine seized in the first two
quarters of 1998 was up dramati cally in some border regions from
1997, based partly on a seven-month program emphasizing ran dom
inspections. The drug czar's office said it was too soon to assess
whether this was the beginning of a turnaround or just a ``blip.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's ideas are likely to be attacked on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies may worry whether their autonomy could be undercut, and
unions are likely to look closely at any changes affecting workers'
assignments or pay. Others may find the recommendations too
military like, even though the drug czar's office has opposed a
plan languish ing in Congress that would permit troops to be
dispatched to help secure the border.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is growing because border traffic is on the rise,
and smugglers are using increasingly sophisticated methods to evade
de tection.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 900,000 U.S.-bound trucks _ about one-quarter of the
total crossing the border _ were subjected to drug-control inspec
tions. Cocaine was found in just 16.
</P>
<P>
   This year, one of the largest border busts came in May when
customs inspectors at Nogales un covered 1,743 pounds of cocaine
hidden in a pair of huge engines of the type used in earth-moving
equipment. &QL;

CONGO AND REBELS CLAIM MILITARY GAINS, NEGATING DIPLOMATIC
EFFORTS

<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ The battle lines in the Congo's three-week-old
civil war were redrawn Sunday as government soldiers and their
allies recaptured a critical military base near the Atlantic coast,
greatly reducing the possibility that rebel forces could march into
the capital here.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the rebels appeared to have seized Kisangani,
the country's third-largest city, solidifying their positions in
eastern Congo. Kisangani is also the port of origin for ships that
carry food and other crucial supplies downstream to countless towns
and villages along the great Congo River.
</P>
<P>
   The developments raised the possibility of a protracted war in
which the government and the rebels, backed by their respective
allies, would fight each other from entrenched geographic positions
in this country's second civil war in as many years. The military
advances also overtook diplomatic efforts, led by South African
President Nelson Mandela, to negotiate a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has pointed up the existing and emerging ethnic,
political and military rivalries in post-Cold War Africa. The
presidents of Rwanda and Uganda, the countries that Congo's
government and most Western diplomats believe are backing the
rebellion, attended the meeting led by Mandela in Pretoria, South
Africa. But Congo's President, Laurent Kabila, and his most vocal
defenders, the presidents of Zimbabwe and Angola, were not present
to hear Mandela's call for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Kinshasa remained eerily calm despite another night of a power
blackout imposed by the rebels as soldiers from Zimbabwe patrolled
the streets atop flatbed trucks. Top aides to Kabila sounded
significantly more confident that the capital, which had seemed
ready to fall into advancing rebel hands any minute, would remain
under government control.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Kabila said, and the rebels acknowledged, that after
several days of bombing, the government and their Angolan allies
Sunday recaptured a military base in Kitona, in the far west. The
rebels had been flying troops and arms more than a thousand miles
from the territory they control in the east to Kitona, from which
they had begun their march toward Kinshasa, which is in the far
western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the airport at Kitona will prevent the rebels
from replenishing their forces, Western diplomatic and
transportation experts said, even as rebels approaching the capital
are running into Congolese troops assisted by soldiers from
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature to say that Kinshasa won't fall now, but this
is a very difficult situation for them,'' said a Western diplomat
here.
</P>
<P>
   No one ruled out, though, that the rebels, who are said to be as
close as 15 miles from Kinshasa, might make a last-ditch attempt to
drive into this city. Indeed, a private transportation company
official with offices in the region said that rebel soldiers
boarded two trains Sunday in Matadi, a city about 220 miles
southwest of the capital that is under rebel control, and were
headed in the direction of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Sakombi Inongo, a senior communications adviser to
Kabila, credited Congo's allies with turning the tide for the
government in the region southwest of Kinshasa. ``We have men and
planes from Angola, and we have men and planes from Zimbabwe,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With Kitona recaptured by the government, the rebels also no
longer appear to be able to send fresh supplies by air to the
southwest, diplomats and transportation company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kitona airport was quiet Sunday night, officials said. They
also said that there were reports that there was little violence in
the eastern city of Kisangani, which the rebels claimed to control.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern town of Goma, along the border with Rwanda, a
rebel leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, said in a news conference
that rebel troops had ``arrived in Kisangani and Kisangani has
fallen,'' Reuters news service reported.
</P>
<P>
   Didier Mumengi, Kabila's Information Minister, said that
Kisangani had not fallen. But two other senior aides to Kabila did
not deny that rebels had captured Kisangani, and diplomats and
transportation company officials said they also had information
that the rebels had captured the city.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The apparent fall of the country's third-largest city is not as
significant as it was during the successful rebellion that Kabila
waged two years ago against Mobutu Sese Seko. Mobutu's 32-year rule
of the nation, which he called Zaire, turned one of Africa's
potentially richest countries into one of its poorest.
</P>
<P>
   During Kabila's efforts to win control of the country, Mobutu
moved foreign mercenaries into Kisangani to stop the rebellion from
the east. But Kabila, who was backed then by Rwanda and Uganda,
easily took the city on his way toward Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   But Kisangani's fall still entails strategic consequences,
Western diplomats said. The Congo River flows for 1,000 miles from
Kisangani to Kinshasa _ past cities, towns and villages that are
surrounded by some of the densest jungle in central Africa and are
inaccessible to trucks traveling in a country with possibly the
worst roads in the world.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no diplomatic solution to this conflict, some
experts predict a scenario in which the Congo would split into two
or more pieces. The rebels would end up controlling the northeast
region near Rwanda and Uganda, while the government would dominate
in the west and south.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, who left Kinshasa more than a week ago, remained Sunday
in the southern city of Lumbumbashi, in his native region, his
aides said. By not attending the conference in Pretoria, Kabila
avoided meeting with the leaders of Rwanda and Uganda, his former
allies, who had placed him at the head of the movement that led to
Mobutu's overthrow.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OSCOW _ The last time Viktor Chernomyrdin took the reins of the
Russian government from a brash band of reformers, in December
1992, he said nothing would change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for deepening the reforms. There is no way back,''
Chernomyrdin pledged then, hours after President Boris Yeltsin
sacked his chief economic adviser, Yegor Gaidar, and made
Chernomyrdin prime minister in his place. But things did change: by
1995, economic reform was near a standstill and Chernomyrdin let it
be known that he thought Western market theory had done the nation
``more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Yeltsin has gone and done it again, firing Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and an entire government of free-market reformers
to make way for Chernomyrdin's return. Neither Yeltsin nor
Chernomyrdin were saying on Sunday what the switch means. Clinton
administration officials said Sunday night that they had been
assured by Chernomyrdin that continuing the economic overhaul of
Russia remains a top priority, although specifics were sparse.
</P>
<P>
   But if history continues to repeat itself, Chernomyrdin will
preside over a government that rocks few establishment boats and
largely prizes the status quo over painful change. Chernomyrdin
innovated little and held fast to many traditions during his
previous five and one-half years as prime minister. Many Western
experts charge that his refusal to dismantle the government
bureaucracy and the industrial oligarchy long allied with it are at
the root of this summer's economic catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters say he brought something to Russia that the
reformers have never been able to secure: stability.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Chernomyrdin is, at heart, an old-school
politician of the Soviet stripe. His entire life was spent in the
petroleum industry: he was born in the southern Ural Mountain
region of Orenburg, educated as an oil-and-gas economist, and
worked seven years at a refinery before getting into city politics
in 1967. By 1982 he was the Soviet Union's deputy minister for the
gas industry, and by 1989 he had transformed the ministry into
Gazprom, a state-owned monopoly that sold gas throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was running Gazprom when the Soviet Union collapsed
in 1991, and in late 1992 Yeltsin plucked him from the Russian
energy ministry to replace Gaidar.
</P>
<P>
   His term did not begin well. After pledging to continue reforms,
he quickly slapped price controls on the economy to combat
inflation _ a move anathema to free-market advocates _ and was
forced to remove them within weeks. He soon tangled with Anatoly
Chubais, a leading economic adviser to Yeltsin, saying Chubais'
program to privatize state-owned industry was akin to Stalin's
forced collectivization of farms.
</P>
<P>
   Such skirmishing continued through his term as prime minister,
though Chernomyrdin cooperated more closely on inflation-fighting
and privatization after the economy and the ruble took a steep
nosedive in October 1994. In 1997, he seemed overshadowed when
Yeltsin named two key reformers, Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, as
deputies to Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin survived because of his unswerving loyalty to
Yeltsin, his ties to the communists who still dominated the
parliament, and his ability to work with Western leaders like Vice
President Al Gore, with whom he served as chairman of a commission
on U.S.-Russian issues.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed another asset too: virtual membership in the family
of so-called oligarchs who control the major industries, banks and
media in Russia. Chernomyrdin was one of them when he ran Gazprom,
and his role in the government undoubtedly helped secure their
support when Yeltsin successfully won a second term in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with this web of conflicting relationships, critics
say, is that Chernomyrdin has performed as if he were paralyzed by
it. The government's privatization program slowed markedly during
his first tenure, as did efforts to improve tax collection and
reduce the amount of trade conducted through barter. He enjoyed
decent relations with the communist Duma in part because his
government offered few proposals _ such as spending cuts _ that
offended it.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks and industries largely enjoyed free reign during
Chernomyrdin's time. His old friends at Gazprom, for example,
struck a deal with the government that dramatically reduced their
monthly tax payments _ and which was promptly revoked after
Chernomyrdin lost the prime minister's job this spring.
</P>
<P>
   During all this time, critics say, Russia's structural economic
problems grew unmolested. In particular, they say, Chernomyrdin
made no attempt to crack down on a banking industry that had become
addicted to risky speculative schemes, to restructure industries
and promote domestic competition, to trim the bureaucracy or to
control government spending. Those same tasks _ plus a national
economic collapse _ now await him .
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Western advisers who were present at the birth of
Yeltsin's economic reform program in the early 1990s are
nevertheless repelled by that notion. ``My assumption is that
Russia's going into a tailspin like Indonesia and Bulgaria,'' said
Anders Aslund, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment in
Washington who resigned as a Yeltsin adviser in 1994 due to
unhappiness with Chernomyrdin. ``The best you can say about his
term as prime minister is that when he was weak, some reforms were
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say Chernomyrdin is no longer the
Soviet apparatchik of his gas ministry days, but a man who has
grown in office and who can work with the West.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin dismissed Chernomyrdin almost without warning in
March and replaced him with Kiriyenko, the president said the
attack on economic problems required new blood. The rumor then was
that Yeltsin had acted because Chernomyrdin harbors ambitions to
succeed him as president.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's party, Our Home Is Russia, is the second-largest
faction in the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, and he has
long been the favored candidate of his oligarch allies.
</P>
<P>
   All he has lacked is public support, usually drawing but
single-digit ratings in polls, and his stolidity and manling of
Russian grammar and syntax are legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one considers what could have been done, and then what we
did do over this long time, one can conclude that something was
done,'' he once said. Now he will have a chance to do still more.

TOBACCO BYPRODUCTS PASSED TO FETUSES, RESEARCHERS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., Mass.)   (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers have found the first direct evidence that a
cancer-causing substance from tobacco is transmitted to fetuses by
pregnant smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hecht of the University of Minnesota Cancer Center said
his findings established that the nicotine-derived chemical NNK is
not only received by the fetus but processed by the body. The
chemical is the only known lung carcinogen found solely in tobacco
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the rate it is passing through the body or the
time spent there, but the study shows substantial exposure of the
fetus to a substance known to cause cancer,'' Hecht said in an
interview before presenting his paper on the findings at this
week's national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with German researchers who provided urine samples
from 48 newborns, Hecht's laboratory found byproducts of NNK in 22
of 31 samples from newborns whose mothers smoked during pregnancy.
None were found in the newborns of nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht's study, which was sponsored by the National Cancer
Institute, detected a substance called NNAL-Gluc, a derivative of
NNK produced in the human body. Its presence in the urine samples
suggested that the newborns had not only taken in but processed the
carcinogen NNK, he said. He called the finding an unacceptable
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not determine whether the infants with the traces
of NNK byproducts in their urine were born addicted to nicotine or
would be at greater risk of developing cancer, Hecht said. He
pointed out that the exposure to the carcinogen might continue for
many years after birth, through secondhand smoke, because most
women who smoke during pregnancy continue to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht used a customized gas chromatography system in the
analysis, the same method he used in reporting last year that
NNAL-Gluc was in the urine of nonsmoking adults exposed to
secondhand smoke. The method used in that study was 20 times more
sensitive than what he used in a 1993 study of nonsmokers exposed
to tobacco smoke from a smoking machine in a small chamber, the
first demonstration that nonsmokers could take up and metabolize
NNK.
</P>
<P>
   ``In newborns there is less material to study and the
concentration is relatively low, but the methodology we have been
using has become increasingly more sensitive and reliable so we are
able to take on more difficult studies,'' Hecht said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to expand the laboratory research to clinical
trials to explore links between the presence of the chemical at
birth and the development of childhood cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to greater risk of
miscarriage, increased chances of complicated births, low birth
weight, sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory infections, and
learning and behavioral problems. But the connection to childhood
cancers is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying the carcinogens in the urine of a newborn is a major
indication of the potential role and the transmission of those
compounds, said Leslie Robison, coordinator of nationwide
epidemiological studies for the Children's Cancer Group, a network
of 2,800 pediatric cancer specialists.

SUMMIT WILL NOT BE CANCELED, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-SHAKEUP, RUSSIA-ASSESS, RUSSIA-CHERNOMYRDIN,
RUSSIA-REACT)

 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior Clinton administration officials said Sunday
that they were troubled by President Boris Yeltsin's decision to
fire the reformist Russian government so close to the summit
meeting with President Clinton next week in Moscow. But a spokesman
said that Clinton had decided to go ahead with his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged that they were taken by surprise by the
move Sunday, which also reinstated former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin. Five months ago, Yeltsin dismissed Chernomyrdin
without warning and installed the young Sergei Kiriyenko as prime
minister with a Cabinet of economic reformers with no discernable
political constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't affect the trip or the timing of the summit at
all,'' said P.J. Crowley, a White House spokesman. ``We have
important bilateral issues. This is an internal Russian matter, and
we obviously will watch it closely. We will continue to work with
the Russian government to advance the reform agenda. What faces
acting Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is the need to take effective
steps to address Russia's economic difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Yeltsin's action raised doubts about his control
and stability, one official said, ``It depends on your starting
point.'' Senior officials say Yeltsin has ``his ups and downs,''
and that he has never regained the stamina and focus he displayed
before his heart attack in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can get up for a big meeting or telephone call with
Clinton,'' one official said. ``But it's not clear he can work for
more than a few hours at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton did not try to reach Yeltsin on Sunday by
telephone, Vice President Al Gore spoke with both Kiriyenko and
Chernomyrdin, who is closer to Gore than to any other U.S.
official. Gore tried to gauge the political climate before Clinton
is due to arrive in Moscow on Sept. 1, and to ask how Washington
can help calm markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's purpose was to urge a continuation of the policies of
economic reform,'' a senior White House official said.
``Chernomyrdin has demonstrated in the past that he's more of a
reformer than many people thought, and he has a lot more support in
the Duma,'' the Russian parliament, which has been blocking reforms
demanded by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The official said it was inappropriate for Gore to raise the
question of a summit postponement. Another official said, ``It
would be a great mistake for us to pull the plug.''
</P>
<P>
   But some prominent and experienced voices outside the government
urged postponement and expressed concern over the apparent U.S.
policy of supporting Yeltsin no matter what he does.
</P>
<P>
   Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser when Jimmy
Carter was president, called on Clinton to postpone the Moscow
summit for a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no point for a bleeding president to be visiting a
sick and unstable president,'' Brzezinski said in an interview. ``I
think a postponement would be very good for both sides. Under the
circumstances, it will be very difficult for Clinton to concentrate
on long-range issues, and they need to be discussed by leaders able
to make their policies stick. Right now, it will be a summit of
posturing and pretense on both sides. And the United States and
Russia need serious, useful summits.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski said that it was clear that Yeltsin ``is passing from
the scene,'' and he urged the Clinton administration to ``reach out
and establish a dialogue with other leaders,'' including Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov; former Gen. Alexander Lebed, now the governor
of a Siberian region; economic reformer and Yeltsin critic Grigory
Yavlinsky; and Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to very clearly and deliberately get off the `My dear
friend, Boris' kick,'' Brzezinski said. ``Yeltsin governs at most a
perimeter of 30 kilometers outside Moscow, and even that is not
under his full control.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Clinton plans to meet opposition and
parliament leaders on Sept. 2 in Moscow, and that all the men
Brzezinski named were invited, including Lebed.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Chernomyrdin, Brzezinski said, ``begins to turn a
tragic situation into a farce.'' Chernomyrdin's return had been
pressed on Yeltsin for some time by the so-called ``oligarchs'' of
the Russian economy, in particular by Boris Berezovsky, who once
served as Yeltsin's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The oligarchs stand to lose a lot of money because of the
devaluation of the ruble last week _ which Yeltsin insisted would
never happen. ``We now have what we might call a provisional
oligarchical government,'' Brzezinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Anders Aslund, a former economic adviser to the Russian
government, described the Yeltsin move as a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means Yeltsin is finished, it makes him look like a puppet,
and Russians can't stand weak leaders,'' said Aslund of the
Carnegie Endowment, and a former diplomat in Moscow. ``This really
puts Clinton in an awful situation. You don't want to go to a
country where there is so much uncertainty in the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The reversion to the stolid Chernomyrdin will not please the
markets, Aslund said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chernomyrdin is the man who ran Russia into its big economic
troubles, and the oligarchs are very happy to have him back,'' he
said. ``It won't provide confidence to the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said that market confidence was Gore's
theme with Chernomyrdin, who seemed aware of Russia's problems with
key parliament sessions coming. ``We'll find out this week if the
shift of authority leads to any noteworthy changes of emphasis in
the Russian economic plan and in the level of support the Duma is
willing to provide,'' the official said. ``The market reaction will
be very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimitri Simes, president of the Nixon Center, a Washington-based
think tank, said Kiriyenko's government was too narrow and too
liberal, ``uninterested in dialogue with the Duma and contemptuous
of public opinion and attitudes.'' Chernomyrdin, for all his
faults, Simes said, has demonstrated he has support among foreign
investors and in the parliament, where he controls the second
largest faction.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Clinton administration seemed to fumble for a
response, with the president at Martha's Vineyard, some top
advisers at the beach and others at home in Washington trying to
recover from a stressful week.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Secretary of Defense William Cohen were all
on Sunday talk shows, but their interviews were taped before the
news came out of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Until this latest shock from Moscow, senior administration
officials were minimizing the risks of the economic upheavals,
which officials attributed largely to the Asian economic crisis and
the softness of oil prices, to Yeltsin and his government of young
reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, senior Treasury officials were not prepared to provide
Russia any more money after the failure of the last IMF loan
package of only a month ago, which sent $4.8 billion to Moscow as
part of a $22.6 billion package.
</P>
<P>
   And senior State Department and White House officials were very
angry with Yeltsin's sharply critical comments after the U.S.
missile strikes last week against targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.
Yeltsin, perhaps for domestic advantage, was harsh in his
reactions, blaming Washington for not consulting him, not providing
evidence and not first working through the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   To American leaders who felt they were acting with urgency to
protect more American lives, Yeltsin's comments were ``offensive,''
one official said, ``and went over very badly around here.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Throughout the 1980s, the Soviet Union threw almost
every weapon it had, short of nuclear bombs, at the Afghan camps
attacked by the United States last week.
</P>
<P>
   During their nine-year occupation of Afghanistan, the Soviets
attacked the camps outside the town of Khost with Scud missiles,
500-pound bombs dropped from jets, barrages of artillery, flights
of helicopter gunships and their crack special forces. The toughest
Soviet commander in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, personally
led the last assault.
</P>
<P>
   But neither carpet bombing nor commandos drove the Afghan holy
warriors from the mountains. Afghanistan has a long history of
repelling superpowers. Its terrain favors defenders as well as any
in the world, whether their opponents, like the Soviets, are trying
to defeat them on the ground or whether, like the United States,
they are trying to disperse, deter and disrupt them. It is
uncertain that the United States, which fired dozens of
million-dollar cruise missiles at those same camps on Thursday, can
do better than the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   The camps, hidden in the steep mountains and mile-deep valleys
of Paktia province, were the place where all seven ranking Afghan
resistance leaders maintained underground headquarters, mountain
redoubts and clandestine weapons stocks during their bitter and
ultimately successful war against Soviet troops from December 1979
to February 1989, according to American intelligence veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan resistance was backed by the intelligence services of
the United States and Saudi Arabia with nearly $6 billion worth of
weapons. And the territory targeted last week, a set of six
encampments around Khost, where the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden has
financed a kind of ``terrorist university,'' in the words of a
senior U.S. intelligence official, is well known to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's military and financial support for the Afghan rebels
indirectly helped build the camps that the United States attacked.
And some of the same warriors who fought the Soviets with the CIA's
help are now fighting under bin Laden's banner.
</P>
<P>
   From those same camps, the Afghan rebels, known as mujahedeen,
or holy warriors, kept up a decadelong siege on the
Soviet-supported garrison town of Khost.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of mujahedeen were dug into the mountains around
Khost. Soviet accounts of the siege of Khost during 1988 referred
to the rebel camps as ``the last word in NATO engineering
techniques.'' After a decade of fighting during which each side
claimed to have killed thousands of the enemy, the Afghan rebels
poured out of their encampments and took Khost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most fiercely contested piece of real estate in
the 10-year Afghan war,'' said Milt Bearden, who ran the CIA's side
of the war from 1986 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said their attack was intended to deter bin
Laden, whom they call the financier and intellectual author of this
month's bombings of two American embassies in Africa. They said the
damage inflicted on the Khost camps was ``moderate to heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the communications infrastructure used by bin Laden is based
on portable satellite telephones, not a centralized
command-and-control system that can be destroyed with a missile,
intelligence officials said. The strongest power that binds his
loose-knit network of confederates is his money, which is hidden
inside a thus-far impenetrable global maze.
</P>
<P>
   And history does not favor superpowers trying to subdue men dug
into the mountains of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has said he spent the 1980s backing the mujahedeen
from their political base in Peshawar, Pakistan, near the foot of
the Khyber Pass. He was most strongly allied with the most
fundamentalist leaders of the Afghan resistance, particularly
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, head of the group called the Islamic Party.
After the fall of the Soviet-backed government, Hekmatyar spent
most of his brief tenure as prime minister of Afghanistan hurling
missiles and mortars at Kabul, trying to dislodge more moderate
rebel leaders from power.
</P>
<P>
   The more militant Afghan rebels, like Hekmatyar, denounced the
United States and backed Iraq during the Persian Gulf war in 1991,
as did bin Laden. A year after the Persian Gulf war, posters
throughout eastern Afghanistan displayed heroic, if imaginary,
portraits of Saddam Hussein and Hekmatyar standing side by side.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of money or moral support could keep the veterans of
the Afghan resistance from killing one another after the fall of
Kabul. The chaos that their infighting created led to the rise of
the Taliban, the militant armed religious party that now controls
most of Afghanistan and harbors bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine years since the Soviet withdrawal, Afghan resistance
veterans have hoarded the remaining weapons sent by the CIA and set
up military training centers at resistance camps like the one near
Khost, according to U.S. officials. In those years, thousands of
Islamic outcasts, radicals and visionaries from around the world
came to the borderlands of Afghanistan to learn the lessons of war
from the mujahedeen. Bin Laden sponsored many of those foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 interview, a commander loyal to Hekmatyar, Noor Amin,
said that ``the whole country is a university for jihad,'' or holy
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many formal training centers,'' Amin said. ``We have
had Egyptians, Sudanese, Arabs and other foreigners trained here as
assassins.'' U.S. officials said the former mujahedeen camps it
attacked on Thursday were precisely that kind of ``university for
jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, stripped of his Saudi citizenship and stateless,
returned to the anarchy of Afghanistan in 1996 from the Sudere U.S. intelligence analysts believe he built at least three
training camps for veterans of the Afghan war.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview with CNN last year that one of his main
missions during the war, which he helped finance with millions of
dollars of his own money, was to transport bulldozers, front-end
loaders and other heavy equipment to Pakistan to help build
tunnels, military depots and roads inside Afghanistan for the
mujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether bin Laden, who inherited about $250
million from a fortune his father made building mosques, palaces
and public works for the Saudi royal family, personally helped
build the Khost camps during the war against the Soviets, or has
substantially upgraded them since returning to the mountains of
Afghanistan.

<P>
   The day after the crash they went first not to a doctor but to a
lawyer. The lawyer sent them to a clinic and the bills started to
mount up. After two months the bills for one boy, 19, came to
$3,740. For his friend, 14, the cost was $4,090.
</P>
<P>
   As Allstate, the insurance company that covered the boys'
accident, sees it, the bills _ including one for $250 for an
initial exam that the boys said took a few minutes _ were grossly
inflated.
</P>
<P>
   The case is but one that Allstate plans to cite on Monday, when
it intends to notify about a dozen Southern California doctors and
chiropractors and their assistants that they are being sued for $25
million for repeatedly overbilling or billing for services they
never provided, in hundreds of cases over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Cases like the one involving the two teenagers, insurance
industry executives say, are part of a widespread pattern of fraud
across the United States. The Insurance Research Council, an
industry organization in Illinois, says that nearly 40 percent of
the claims for auto accident injuries now involve fraud. And a
fortune is at stake. Last year alone, insurers received claims for
more than $42 billion for auto-accident injuries.
</P>
<P>
   While insurance fraud is a problem as old as insurance itself,
industry experts see a disturbing variation on the theme: Rather
than premeditated criminal activity involving supposed accident
victims, insurers say some doctors and clinics are capitalizing on
real accidents and real injuries by seeking reimbursement for
procedures not required and never performed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Insurance Research Council says 90 percent of the
offenses are not planned but are ``opportunistic fraud'' in which
professionals, and sometimes patients, seize a chance to profit
with little apparent likelihood of being caught.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Allstate, the country's second-largest auto insurer, is
starting to go after doctors and clinics across the country where
they are finding evidence of such overbilling.
</P>
<P>
   The California suits, which were filed under seal two months ago
as required by that state's law and will be served to the parties
Monday, are the first of their kind by a major auto insurer. But
they are not the last. Edward Moran, the chief of investigations
for Allstate, said the company was developing cases against other
doctors and clinics in San Francisco; Chicago; Memphis, Tenn.;
Miami; Philadelphia and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want doctors to know there is a price to pay for committing
insurance fraud,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees about the magnitude of the problem. Leaders
of the American Medical Association and the Association of Trial
Lawyers of America, the leading organization of personal injury
lawyers, say they believe the insurance industry is vastly
overstating the extent of the fraud. They say they suspect that
charges of fraud are a cynical tactic by insurers to limit the
reimbursements they pay out.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is not simply a figment of the insurance
industry's imagination. In recent years there have been some
stunning cases of respected hospital and health maintenance
organization officials being charged by government investors with
overbilling for Medicare and Medicaid services.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, however, auto insurers have not systematically
attacked the problem. In the past, they tried to deny suspicious
claims _ which they continue to do _ or tried to discount them when
they were negotiating settlements. But the problem has only grown
worse, the insurers say.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suits are an extension of earlier efforts by
Allstate, by State Farm, the largest auto insurer, and by some of
their competitors to file civil suits and help build criminal cases
against gangs around the country that make a business of staging
fake accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, organizers, known as cappers, recruit people to
drive into the paths of unsuspecting motorists and cause crashes.
Then, often working through corrupt lawyers and doctors, the
recruits, often three or four in a single car, begin building up
fake medical bills for submission to insurers.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Allstate sued 45 doctors, lawyers, and
fake-accident organizers in Los Angeles for $107 million in the
largest suit ever filed in connection with fake auto accidents.
State Farm has filed several suits against fake-accident rings and
is at work on several more.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suits in Southern California are different. The
accidents, as far as the insurers know, were real. And, also as far
as they can tell, all the fraud took place in clinics where, to
increase their earnings, all the doctors and chiropractors had to
do was indicate on insurance forms that they had performed costly
procedures when, in fact, they had done little or no work.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say that in some of the overbilling, patients are
silent partners in fraud with their doctors, often encouraged by
personal injury lawyers. The practice of settling auto insurance
claims, the insurers say, is generally to pay two or three times
the amount of medical bills for pain and suffering. So the more
doctors charge, the more a patient and his lawyer are likely to
get.
</P>
<P>
   For example, with medical bills of $2,000 an insurer might pay a
settlement of $6,000; with bills of $4,000, the settlement can
often be $12,000. (The incentive for fraudulently building up
claims like this is reduced or eliminated by some no-fault plans
that provide payment for pain and suffering only for catastrophic
injuries.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many patients may be unaware that their treatment is being
padded. They often pay little attention to their bills, seldom
bothering to check billing codes, descriptions of treatments and
costs, even if they are decipherable, because they know the
insurance company is paying. And often, when lawyers are involved,
doctors' bills go not to the patient but to the lawyer for
forwarding to the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the nature of the treatment for some of the most
common auto accident injuries, whiplash and other strains and
sprains, is not altogether unpleasant. So it may be difficult for a
patient to protest if he is offered 25 sessions of massage,
ultra-sound and alternating hot and cold packs, when a dozen might
suffice. To further complicate matters, professionals may truly
differ on how many such therapy sessions are enough.
</P>
<P>
   In its suits against doctors, Allstate says it is not trying to
dictate treatment. ``We're not challenging doctors' individual
decisions,'' Moran said. ``We're challenging a pattern of billing
at the highest possible level in order to inflate claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randolph Smoak, chairman of the AMA's board of trustees,
said that while insurers may challenge a doctor's choice of billing
codes, he believes there is little deliberate abuse. Rather than
taking doctors to court, as Allstate is doing, he said, the first
step should be a discussion to resolve billing differences.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Kass, an insurance fraud specialist in the Los Angeles
law firm of Manning, Marder &AMP; Wolfe working for Allstate, said the
insurer was not moving against doctors suspected of overbilling in
a few instances, but against ``personal injury mills treating
hundreds and hundreds of people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Allstate had not tried to negotiate with the doctors it
was suing or advised them of the legal action out of concern that
incriminating evidence might be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and lawyers feel besieged. ``What the insurance
companies are doing is attacking the only source of help these
injured people have, the doctors who treat them and the lawyers who
represent them,'' said Mark Mandell, the president of the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America.
</P>
<P>
   In the cases now being developed by Allstate, the insurer is not
trying to prosecute those involved in the accidents, Kass said.
Trying to establish whether patients were aware of fraud is
difficult, he said. But the doctors, he said, lay down a trail of
evidence by submitting falsified bills.

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ For the last seven years, Hawaii has felt the winds
of economic change blowing only one way across the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the country has prospered, enjoying job growth,
state budget surpluses and contented citizenry _ all to the benefit
of many political incumbents facing re-election this year _ Hawaii
remains a stubborn exception.
</P>
<P>
   Here, despite the spectacular vistas of ocean, mountains and
lava fields that make tourism the backbone of the state economy,
turmoil in Asian financial markets has rocked the island like an
unrelenting hurricane, causing a sharp decline in investment,
minimal growth in tourism, job loss and public pessimism. The
annual economic growth rate here in recent years, half of a
percent, pales beside a national rate that has reached as high as
3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, economists here have detected slight
indications that the worst may have passed and that Hawaii could
finally be turning a corner _ much to the relief of Gov. Benjamin
Cayetano, the latest in an unbroken line of Democratic governors
since Hawaii joined the union in 1959. Upon his election in 1994,
he inherited the worst fiscal crisis in state history, and now that
the budget has been balanced for two years, he is trumpeting his
policies as a major reason to re-elect him in November.
</P>
<P>
   But Cayetano, the state's first Filipino-American governor, may
yet become just another victim of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As if the stars over Hawaii's sparkling beaches and pristine
waters have suddenly realigned, a Republican, Maui Mayor Linda
Lingle, is favored to defeat him in November, according to the
latest statewide polls. How startling is that? Among the 76 members
of the state Legislature, only 14 are Republicans, and across
Hawaii, Republicans are outnumbered by such a wide margin that some
say they are embarrassed or reluctant to admit their affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the enduring sluggish economy seems to be pushing
many people beyond a point where party loyalty determines their
vote, and after four decades of Democratic rule, the state's 1.2
million people might finally be in for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing sense here that Hawaii has become a little
like the old Soviet Union or North Korea with its centralized,
absolute power,'' said Randy Roth, a law professor at the
University of Hawaii here on the island of Oahu and president-elect
of the state bar association. ``Monopoly of political power has cut
off all debate, and that has evolved into the political culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth, whose nonpartisanship allowed him to moderate a local
radio talk show for five years, became so impressed with Ms. Lingle
that he abandoned his neutrality last week to endorse her and join
the campaign as a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Economic policy and one-party rule were never major concerns in
Hawaii until the collapse of the Japanese yen in the early 1990s
ended years of heavy investment by Japanese banks. The economic
activity had become so frenetic and dazzling that Cayetano
officials now concede that it stunted any creative planning by the
previous administration of Gov. John Waihee III.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a boom period, and government wanted to stay in
control,'' said Seija Naya, a former bank economist who is now
director of the state's Department of Business, Economic
Development and Tourism. ``They added more regulations, charged
more fees and made it harder for businesses to receive approvals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese investors barely noticed. Then the bubble burst,
and recession set in. Since 1991, many hotels and businesses built
with Japanese money have sold for a fraction of their original
cost. And no longer do Asian investors knock on doors of fancy
homes and offer the owner $1 million or more to sell on the spot,
as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian withdrawal overshadowed other disturbing developments.
Production of sugar and pineapple, once staples of the state
economy, has been falling for decades as the Philippines and
Caribbean nations produce them more cheaply. Only a few plantations
are still operating, and the number of agricultural jobs in the
state decreased by 36 percent, to 7,200 last year from 11,300 in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also hurt the state economy, largely
through the reduction of personnel at the state's military bases.
In 1996, the overall number of federal employees in Hawaii fell by
almost a quarter, to 74,119, from a high of 97,853 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Cayetano, 57, a lawyer and former state legislator, has worked
hard to blunt the impact of the Asian crisis. In an interview at
the Capitol last week, he recited a long list of accomplishments,
saying he has reduced the size of government by 500 people, cut the
state's personal income tax for the first time, increased spending
on marketing efforts to attract visitors to islands other than
Oahu, and created novel incentives like eliminating landing fees
for airlines to attract new carriers to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made some hard decisions that have hurt us
politically,'' he said. ``But that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever so slowly, his policies are beginning to help nudge the
state forward again. Tourism from the mainland is rebounding,
compensating for Asian visitors who are staying fewer days and
spending fewer dollars. Unemployment is starting to drop. New small
businesses are opening. An embryonic high-technology industry is
emerging.
</P>
<P>
   But those changes have done little to dampen growing support for
Ms. Lingle, who is attracting people in both parties who say
Cayetano and the Legislature have done too little too late to make
any meaningful recovery possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lingle, 44, a native of St. Louis who came to Hawaii in 1976
as a journalist, has served as Maui's mayor the last eight years.
Her opponent in the Sept. 19 primary, former Honolulu Mayor Frank
Fasi, is not viewed as a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   In part because her island is favored as a vacation spot more by
Americans than Japanese, Maui has resisted much of Hawaii's
economic downturn. The number of jobs on Maui has increased in five
of the last six years, enabling Ms. Lingle to sharpen her attack on
Democratic policies that have not done more to help the state
economy. She has outlined a five-point revitalization strategy,
which includes a comprehensive plan to diversify the economy and
simplify business regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a turning point in our history,'' she told a rally of
about 600 voters this week at a high school in the middle-class
suburbs of east Honolulu. ``It's time for a change, and change is
about joining the other 49 states with economic revitalization that
is taking place all across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending the rally was Calvin Griffin, the owner of a small
tent manufacturing company who described himself as an independent
voter and frustrated over policies that have caused him to
subcontract work to California and Mexico, rather than employ
Hawaiians. He said he came to hear more of Ms. Lingle's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could create 50 to 100 more jobs, but I've had to cut back
because of restrictive regulations,'' Griffin said. ``I think it's
because of the good ol' boy network here. It's not what you know.
It's who you know.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though few of Ms. Lingle's ideas are radically different from
Cayetano's, she has nonetheless caught a wave of voter
disenchantment, emerging at a time when many Hawaiians are
receptive to the idea of change if only for change's sake. Of
Hawaii's two House seats, both held by Democrats, one is in
jeopardy. Rep. Neil Abercrombie, who is seeking a sixth term to
represent the Honolulu area, is fighting for his political life
against Quentin Kawananakoa, who is expected to win the Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lingle has also captured the attention of leading
Republicans on the mainland. Just last week, she flew to New York
City for a fund-raiser with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani that she said
brought her $100,000 in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Cayetano argued that his administration was taking steps to
eliminate the red tape that frustrates small business owners like
Griffin. He also said that any governor would have been stymied by
the problems arising from such a dramatic drop in foreign
investment as Hawaii experienced, to less than $500 million in 1994
from $3.6 billion in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Though conceding that the state must do a better job finding new
sources of jobs and revenues to ease the reliance on tourism as the
major economic engine, he said many voters had ignored the
accomplishments of his administration and failed to see the nascent
signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged that convincing voters that the state
is finally on the right track could be a daunting challenge this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big mood for change here,'' he said, referring to
Ms. Lingle. ``She is the favorite to win the Republican primary.
She is a good speaker, and she has painted herself as a fresh face
on the screen. But we have planted the seeds so we can diversify
the economy. And finally we are seeing some positive signs.''

FEDERAL OFFICIALS SHAKEN BY PRESIDENT'S ADMISSION
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CLINTON-STARR-STRATEGY, CLINTON-CHURCHES,
CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-VACATION) 
(jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton began his speech
acknowledging a relationship with Monica Lewinsky, many federal
officials were hoping it would put an end to the distractions and
malaise that have affected much of the work of government of the
last seven months. Instead, policy mavens working on issues like
housing and health care, AIDS and international problems said they
had experienced a kind of collective shudder.
</P>
<P>
   A few felt personally offended by the president's unsavory
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, who had been a 21-year-old intern
at the White House and whose link to the president was made
irrefutable by his admission.
</P>
<P>
   But most simply expressed profound disappointment, more
professional than personal. Their faith shaken, many of these
officials said they now faced a potential sustained fallout that
threatened to weaken not just Clinton's legacy but his
administration's muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Jennings, a White House aide who coordinates health
policy for the president, said he had a sense of ``lost
opportunities and missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're frustrated that this has distracted from our ability to
push his agenda,'' Jennings said. ``We are disappointed in him for
contributing to his problems in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   For an administration characterized by its relative youth and
verve, last Monday's presidential speech, with its blend of
confession and defiance, seemed to exhaust and bewilder. ``Everyone
here is best described as sort of numb, and dismayed,'' Jennings
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all his soldiers,'' Jennings added. ``If he and Mrs.
Clinton want to do something, we'll do it for them. I don't think
anyone here feels any less commitment to do positive things for
this country. But there's a sense of frustration that we can't
focus on issues that really mean something to people day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the president's evident engagement in foreign policy
matters, several aides and federal officials said they harbored
serious doubts about his ability, or desire, to push for a domestic
agenda as he wrangled with his legal troubles. Clinton had no
choice but to react to a foreign policy emergency. But the
officials were considerably less optimistic about issues like
health care and environmental policy, issues that typically require
long attention spans and a willingness to slug it out with
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Months and months have been wasted,'' said Ezekiel Emanuel,
the chief bioethics officer at the National Institutes of Health,
adding that there has been ``a lot of drift'' since the first
accusations of sex and lies in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Clinton's reputation for compartmentalizing his
problems, a talent that has kept him focused even during his most
trying moments, Emanuel could not help but wonder whether the
Lewinsky matter and its expected repercussions on Capitol Hill
would tap him out. ``It's got to sap the guy's energy and ability
to focus,'' Emanuel said.

<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress have been grumbling about
Clinton's arm's-length posture since early this year, saying it
made governing in tandem, always a delicate prospect, even more
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, many of Clinton's supporters had offered him the
benefit of the doubt, and a few loyal followers risked their own
credibility defending him publicly and privately. One official
seemed shaken on a more personal level about Clinton's admission.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who worked on Clinton's 1992 campaign and now works on
foreign policy for the administration dismissed the Lewinsky
allegations several months ago. ``We worked very hard for this man,
and I don't believe he did those things,'' she said at the time.
``I just don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, when asked about the president's admission of ``a
relationship with Miss Lewinsky,'' the same official, again
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: ``This is really a
very painful topic. I don't want to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were not surprised that Clinton committed an
indiscretion. They said they could not fathom how anyone who had
worked with the president for an extended period of time could
indulge in ``choirboy'' illusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why everyone is now walking around with shock on their faces
is a mystery to me,'' said Sandra Thurman, the director of the
White House Office of National AIDS Policy who also helped the
Clinton team handle the uproar over Gennifer Flowers in the 1992
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thurman likened the scandal's effect on policy to a ``slow
leak'' in a boat, one that does not necessarily spell doom for its
passengers. Acknowledging that she feels ``a sense of
frustration,'' she added: ``Our work continues, but the Lewinsky
matter does make the water a little choppy to navigate. It doesn't
change the respect I have for the president or how I feel about his
commitment to addressing the issues.''

SURVIVOR INSISTS ATTACKED AFGHAN CAMP WAS RELIGIOUS SCHOOL

<P>
   PESHAWAR, Pakistan _ Dr. Ahmad Sarwar insists he is not a
terrorist, that he was at a camp not far from here, on the other
side of the border in Afghanistan, for religious studies. The 60
students in the camp last Thursday were reading and studying the
Koran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just finished our dinner, we were preparing to go to
bed,'' he said in the Hayatabad hospital here, where he was
visiting an injured comrade on Sunday. ``We saw a fireball coming
toward us, which hit an area 15 yards away.''
</P>
<P>
   They ran for cover, he said, and there were five or six more
explosions. He escaped injury. Twenty-one people died, 15 while
sleeping in the mosque, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarwar, 38, was at the camp known as Harkat Mujahedeen, one of
those hit by U.S. missiles last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the attack was to break what the United States says
is a terrorist network led by Osama bin Laden, the man the
Americans say was responsible for the bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Sarwar denied Sunday that the camps were for anything other than
religious purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Moslem has the right to study in a religious school,''
he said. ``We had no guns. We did no wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarwar said he is an Afghan. In the hospital where he spoke with
reporters, another man, Habib-ur-Rehman, 22, lay hooked up to an
intravenous feeding machine, suffering from serious injuries from
the missile attack. He too said that he is an Afghan who had been
at the camp for religious purposes. But Pakistani reporters who
interviewed the men Saturday said that both are Pakistani.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials, as well as Pakistani journalists and
residents of this region, said the camps the Americans hit were
military training centers. They say that two camps were for
Pakistanis and Afghans and another was for Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   They say that those trained in the Harkat Mujahedeen camp _ the
name comes from a Pakistani-based Islamic movement _ are sent to
fight in Kashmir, where Pakistani-backed rebels have waged a long
war for independence from India, Pakistan's regional enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Harkat Mujahedeen is the name for a group that was called Harkat
Ansar until the State Department put it on its list of terrorist
groups last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, bin Laden was rebuked by Mullah Mohammed Omar, the
spiritual leader of the Taliban, the fundamentalist Islamic
movement that is the de facto government of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Omar was upset that after the missile attack bin Laden publicly
issued new threats against Americans, saying that the war had just
begun. ``I have sent my envoy to tell him that he should show
restraint, and that we cannot have two parallel emirates in
Afghanistan,'' Omar said in a telephone interview Sunday with
Rahimullah Yusufzai, the bureau chief here for The News, an
English-language daily. ``We have conveyed to him that the Islamic
Emirate of Afghanistan will take appropriate measures to give an
answer to the attack on its soil by the U.S. at an appropriate
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has been operating in Afghanistan for two years. While
the Taliban have made repeated promises to restrict his activities,
the Clinton administration says they have not done so.
</P>
<P>
   The reprimand reflects a struggle between the two men for the
limelight and not a split over policy or activities, said Yusufzai,
who has been covering the Taliban for several years. Omar is
apparently unhappy that the Taliban's recent victories _ they have
vanquished most of their opponents and now control most of the
country _ have been lost in the focus on bin Laden's bombs and
bombast.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have refused to allow
journalists to enter the country since the missile attack, giving
rise to conjecture among journalists and diplomats that the sites
hit were indeed military camps and not religious schools, as the
Taliban contend, and that the number of casualties was not high.
</P>
<P>
   Four senior journalists who tried to reach the area where the
missiles hit have been missing since Friday morning and are
presumably being held by the Taliban at Khost, the town nearest to
the camps attacked by the Americans. They are B.K. Bangash, a
Pakistani photographer with The Associated Press; his younger
brother Said, a photographer with Agence France-Presse; Zaheeruddin
Abdullah, an Afghan reporter for AP; and Salahuddin, who uses only
one name, an Afghan reporter with the Reuters news service.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it was that he had managed to escape death when the
missiles had landed so close to him, Sarwar said Sunday, ``God
Almighty save us because we are Moslems and God helps Moslems and
not non-Moslems. We are innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, seeming to belie his insistence that the camps were for
only for the purpose of religious education, he said, ``We will
show the Americans when we strike back how God punishes them.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Los Angeles Dodgers
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: TBS.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: LHP Tom Glavine (16-5, 2.53;
13-14, 3.90 lifetime vs. Dodgers) vs. LHP Brian Bohanon (6-8, 2.85;
0-1, 5.73 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: Glavine resumes his quest for his fourth 20-win season
and first since 1993. This is his first outing of the year against
the Dodgers, one of only two teams with winning records against the
lefthander. He'd won four straight decisions, the last two
complete-game shutouts that extended his scoreless innings streak
to 23, before San Francisco beat Glavine 6-2 Wednesday. That outing
(eight singles, five runs, five innings) was Glavine's shortest in
20 appearances since May 3. Bohanon, acquired July 10 from the Mets
for ex-Brave reliever Greg McMichael, is 4-4 with a 2.52 ERA in
eight starts with L.A., where's he's thrown far better as a starter
than he did in Flushing. He became just the second left-hander to
start for the Dodgers in the last seven seasons (Carlos Perez,
Sunday night's starter, became the third). Bohanon is coming off a
6-5 loss Wednesday in PIttsburgh. Three of the six runs he allowed
were unearned, two scoring on Bohanon's own throwing error.
Primarily a reliever in New York (four starts, 21 relief
appearances), Bohanon served up Rafael Belliard's epic home run
last Sept. 26, Belliard's second career homer and first after 10
years and 1,869 at-bats. Tony Graffanino, the Braves right-handed
hitting second baseman, will be in the lineup. With good reason:
he's 4-for-4 lifetime off Bohanon, with a homer; Gerald Williams is
a career .750 hitter (6-for-8) against him.

 &HT;    Election ad spending a hot topic in California
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA, Calif. _ The residents of the central California
coast have grown accustomed to costly advertising by outsiders in
their political affairs, but this year they may have their
congressional campaign to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Interest groups that spent heavily on radio and television
advertising in successive congressional campaigns are planning more
modest forays or nothing at all in the district that takes in a
sizable chunk of the Pacific coast between Los Angeles and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And the people who endured ads about late-term abortions, terms
limits and other issues are grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mind them speaking out. It's the amount of money they
spent that really bothers me,'' said Suzette Caddy, a homemaker
from San Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   Caddy was among 350 Republicans who sat in an unairconditioned
junior college gymnasium Sunday to hear Speaker Newt Gingrich
endorse Republican Tom Bordonaro in his rematch with Democratic
Rep. Lois Capps.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.), chairman of the House Republicans'
campaign committee, made a separate visit to the district this
weekend for Bordonaro.
</P>
<P>
   Capps beat Bordonaro in a closely watched special election in
March to fill the seat held by her husband, Walter, who died of a
heart attack in October.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Capps ousted Republican Rep. Andrea Seastrand in 1996,
when a dozen independent groups flooded the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans both complained that the candidates'
views were lost in the cacophony of ads. ``It became a race of what
others wanted it to be and not necessarily the message I wanted to
get out,'' Bordonaro said.
</P>
<P>
   But the anticipated change in 1998 is not some noble gesture on
the part of the independent groups that evade federal limits on
campaign spending by running ads that technically do not support or
oppose anyone, but make clear where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in the view of Eric O'Keefe, whose term-limits group
plans up to $10 million in ads nationwide this year, this election
is not in doubt, despite the high-level campaign stops this
weekend,.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, Capps would win it and we don't see any reason
to go in,'' said O'Keefe, director of Americans for Limited Terms .
</P>
<P>
   Capps signed the group's pledge not to serve more than six
years, and benefitted from its advertising when Bordonaro refused
to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are willing to speak as bluntly as O'Keefe, but the
conservative Campaign for Working Families, which advertised
Bordonaro's support for and Capps's opposition to a ban in certain
late-term abortions, did not include Bordonaro on the list of
candidates it has endorsed for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   And in another sign, Linder refused to commit the resources of
the Republican campaign committee, which is planning a $37 million
advertising campaign much like those of the independent groups.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional district is considered closely divided between
Democrats and Republicans, but University of California at San
Diego political scientist Gary Jacobson said Bordonaro is more
conservative than the district. The one issue that O'Keefe said
could make the contest closer is President Clinton's relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Gingrich also
touched on the topic in his remarks, recalling his first
congressional campaign in 1974 in the wake of President Nixon's
resignation from office. He lost that race, which he blamed in part
on disillusioned Republicans who chose not to vote that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not drawing any direct parallels with this year,''
Gingrich said, conveying precisely the opposite impression.

HEMINGWAY'S LATEST: A BLEND OF LIFE, FICTION AND AN AFRICAN BRIDE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, Ill., Mass., Calif.)   (Eds: Note language in quoted material in 16th graph) 
(With HEMINGWAY-EXCERPT; duplication warning: also moved in ``e''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1954, after surviving two African plane crashes, Mau Mau
marauders and domestic life on safari with his fourth wife, Mary
(and just maybe a mysterious tribal bride or two), Ernest Hemingway
returned home to Cuba and began work on a long autobiographical
novel.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, interrupted by the filming of ``The Old Man and
the Sea,'' he put aside the unfinished 200,000-word manuscript.
With Fidel Castro's revolution, he abandoned Cuba and the book; in
July 1961, just short of his 62nd birthday, he took his life with a
shotgun in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a long repose in the limbo of restricted files in the
John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, placed there by Mary Hemingway
after both men's deaths, the book _ edited down by half and
described as the last unpublished full-length Hemingway work _ is
being prepared for publication in time for the centennial of the
author's birth in Oak Park, Ill., next July 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it; there are no more books,'' said Charles Scribner
III, whose family imprint, now part of Simon &AMP; Schuster, is
bringing out what it calls the fictional memoir, ``True at First
Light,'' as edited by Hemingway's middle son, Patrick, 70.
</P>
<P>
   A.E. Hotchner, who related anecdotes from the safari in his 1966
biography, ``Papa Hemingway,'' called the release of the latest
work ``a big publishing event'' but voiced surprise that Hemingway
had never mentioned the book to him during many discussions of
other projects. ``It's a mystery to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing plans were disclosed by Daily Variety this month,
but the work was not unknown. Scholars inventoried the manuscript
in 1969, and in 1971 and 1972 Sports Illustrated serialized a
50,000-word excerpt as Hemingway's ``African Journal,'' part of
which was included in a 1974 anthology, ``The Enduring Hemingway.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other works that Hemingway left in varying stages of
completion were previously published, to mixed reviews: ``A
Moveable Feast,'' ``Islands in the Stream,'' ``The Dangerous
Summer'' and ``The Garden of Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would rank these with quasi-autobiographical masterpieces
like ``A Farewell to Arms'' and ``The Sun Also Rises,'' and given
the fanatical care Hemingway took with his writing there is some
question of how happy he would be to have his reputation and last
printed words entrusted solely to any editor, even a son.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Hemingway said that he was aware of the responsibility
and that aside from a few place names he had not changed any of his
father's words, although he acknowledged that condensing the book
inevitably reshaped it.
</P>
<P>
   For the few who have read it, a mystique has long clung to the
sprawling 850-page blend of autobiography and fiction, in part over
the ambiguous character named Debba, an 18-year-old woman from the
Wakamba tribe whom the narrator casually takes as a second wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Hemingways both fed the intrigue by offering even richer
versions of the story to biographers, although Patrick Hemingway,
who took part in the safari, says the marriage to Debba is
fictional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Ernest Hemingway have such an experience?'' he said from
his home in Bozeman, Mont. ``I can tell you from all I know _ and I
don't know everything _ he did not.''
</P>
<P>
   But because Hemingway's adventurous life and his fiction have
been so intertwined, the new book is sure to raise questions about
how much of the story is literally true. Hemingway was elliptical
on the issue. All good books have something in common, he liked to
say: ``They are truer than if they had really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``True at First Light,'' a title Patrick Hemingway selected from
the text to suggest the deceptiveness of the senses, is based on
Hemingway's second safari to East Africa, in 1953, just as ``Green
Hills of Africa'' was based on his first safari, 20 years earlier.
Some characters, notably the revered white hunter _ in real life,
Hemingway's friend Philip Percival, ``the finest man that I know''
_ are the same.
</P>
<P>
   But on that first safari, Hemingway was accompanied by his
second wife, Pauline Pfeiffer, Vogue's Paris correspondent, with
whom he had two sons, Patrick and Gregory, and for whom he had
divorced Hadley Richardson, who was the mother of his first son,
John, called Bumby. By the second safari Hemingway had divorced
Pauline, as well as his third wife, Martha Gellhorn, also a writer,
and had married Mary Welsh, a Time-Life correspondent whom he had
met in wartime London.
</P>
<P>
   The interplay of these relationships is a theme in the book,
along with age and enlightenment, spirituality and the hypnotic
spell of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot describe a wild lion's roar,'' Hemingway writes.
``You can only say that you listened and the lion roared. It is not
at all like the noise the lion makes at the start of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer pictures. When you hear it you first feel it in
your scrotum and it runs all the way up through your body.''
</P>
<P>
   The book also tracks Mary Hemingway's obsessive quest to kill a
cattle-thieving black lion as mythic and elusive as Melville's
white whale. She gets her lion, but in a way that exposes painful
fault lines in the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Paris is in the book too, and Ezra Pound and baseball and
prodigious drinking and meditations on the soul _ ``probably a
spring of clear fresh water that never diminished in the drought
and never froze in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway and Miss Mary, as she is called in the book, arrived
in the Kenyan port of Mombasa in the summer of 1953 and set up camp
at Percival's Kitanga Farm. The party included Denis Zaphiro, a
game ranger nicknamed G.C., for ``gin crazed,'' and Earl Theisen, a
Look photographer. Hemingway had contracted to write a piece for
the magazine to defray costs. Patrick, an art history major who had
graduated magna cum laude from Harvard and become a licensed white
hunter in Tanganyika, also joined them for a time, along with a
safari staff of 22.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to counter the bad publicity from the terrorist uprising
of the Kikuyu tribe against white landholders that became known as
the Mau Mau emergency, and grateful for the tourists drawn by his
books and movies, the Kenya authorities designated Hemingway
honorary game warden for the region. For five months they hunted
rogue lions that were poaching cattle, leopards, a wounded rhino,
birds and other game.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mary Hemingway kept a diary, Hemingway wrote no notes,
as usual. ``I just push the recall button and there it is,'' he
told Hotchner.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1954, the Hemingways were in a small plane over
Murchison Falls when the bush pilot nicked a telephone line and
crashed. The couple escaped with relatively minor injuries.
Evacuated by a passing boat on the White Nile, they found a
commercial pilot who offered to fly them to Entebbe in Uganda. On
takeoff the plane burst into flames. This time they were more
seriously hurt but recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Back home safely that fall in his beloved Cuban refuge, Finca
Vigia, or Lookout Farm, outside Havana, Hemingway grumbled his
pleasure at having won the Nobel Prize for Literature and began
work on the African book.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the early '70s Sports Illustrated excerpts focus heavily
on hunting, they also offer broader glimpses of a work that is now
to be Hemingway's final testament, and perhaps a last introspective
look into a famously complex and colorful literary colossus.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of ``True at First Light'' talks about a changed
Africa and his boredom at reading so much about himself by fatuous
people who pretend to know all about his inner life, and he quickly
and playfully brings up the ``the matter of my fiancee'' _ Debba,
``very beautiful and quite young and more than perfectly
developed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Miss Mary calls herself the jealous type, vowing to
kill any woman who steals her husband's affections, but she says
this doesn't apply to his African fiancee. Miss Mary says further,
``Since when does a good loving husband not have a right to a
fiancee if she only wishes to be a supplementary wife?''
</P>
<P>
   Two biographies suggested that the account was not entirely
fictional.
</P>
<P>
   In his authoritative 1969 biography, ``Ernest Hemingway, A Life
Story,'' Carlos Baker, drawing on Mary Hemingway's diaries, says
that toward the end of the 1953 safari Hemingway showed signs of
``wanting to go native,'' telling Mrs. Hemingway she was
``depriving him of his new wife,'' the Wakamba girl Debba.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hemingway, the account goes on, did not take offense,
suggesting only that Debba ``ought first to have a much needed
bath.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hemingway left the camp for some pre-Christmas shopping in
Nairobi, and she returned to find that Hemingway had dyed his
jacket and shirts in Masai colors, taken up the spear and invited
Debba and some of her friends into the camp, celebrating so
energetically that they broke Mrs. Hemingway's bed. Warned of
possible trouble from Debba's family, Hemingway returned her to her
village, but she was among the people of the tribe invited back for
Christmas celebrations, the Baker account concludes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Papa Hemingway,'' Hotchner says that in Venice in 1954,
Hemingway ``told us of his startling nuptials,'' relating that when
his wife was away in Nairobi, he had taken an 18-year-old Wakamba
bride and ``as local custom dictated, inherited her sister,'' a
widow of 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three of them slept on a goatskin bed 14 feet wide, Ernest
said, and when Mary returned she was very solicitous about the
event and impressed with the lofty position Ernest had attained in
the tribe by virtue of his matrimony,'' the Hotchner book recounts.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on to report that shortly afterward, Hemingway counted
on his fingers and said, ``September I will have an African son.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Hotchner said that in a letter written to him on
March 14, 1954, from aboard the ship Africa, Hemingway first
recounted the native marriage, adding: ``I'm very happy with my
lovely wives with their impudence and solicitude and stacked better
than M. Monroe but with good hard palms to their hands and smell
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same long letter Hemingway said he had dictated 16,000
words ``and I hope I have kept it funny.'' It appears to be a
reference to the Look article, which had already appeared as a
photo-essay of hardly 2,000 words, so the rest probably become the
kernel of ``True at First Light.'' The letter is part of an
exchange of correspondence with Hemingway that the Oxford
University Press plans to bring out for the centennial, Hotchner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he was more than dubious of any actual marriage,
given Hemingway's mischievous streak and love of practical jokes,
as when he graphically described making love to the spy Mata Hari,
although, it turned out, she was executed by the French the year
before he arrived in Italy in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Look photographer, Theisen, in his letters home
between August and October 1953 never mentioned Debba, according to
a recheck of his correspondence by his daughter, Roxie Livingston,
in Los Angeles.

<P>
   Patrick Hemingway said furthermore that the manuscript made no
mention of the sister-bride, a further sign the story was made up.
</P>
<P>
   And no African son of Hemingway has ever emerged.
</P>
<P>
   After Hemingway's suicide and despite the virtual state of war
between Cuba and the United States after the 1961 Bay of Pigs
invasion, President Kennedy helped arrange for Mrs. Hemingway to
return to Finca Vigia, which Castro planned to turn into a museum,
to retrieve her husband's belongings, including the manuscript,
left in a bank vault.
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy's assassination in 1963, she placed the bulk of
Hemingway's papers at the Kennedy Library. She died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of ``True at First Light'' and the other
uncompleted works, the papers were opened to the public at the
library's temporary quarters in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent Kennedy Library opened in 1980, and the collection
is now centered in the Hemingway Room, where spread on the floor is
the very real skin of the black lion Mary Hemingway shot in 1953.

YELTSIN DISMISSES ECONOMIC REFORMERS, REINSTATES CHERNOMYRDIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-ASSESS, RUSSIA-CHERNOMYRDIN, RUSSIA-REACT)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a desperate grasp for political support, President
Boris Yeltsin Sunday fired his new team of economic reformers and
reinstated Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's surprise decision came just five months after he
derided Chernomyrdin as a spent force and cast him out of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt action raised fresh doubts about the Kremlin's
commitment to tough economic reforms, as well as unsettling
questions about Yeltsin's ability to govern.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has hired and fired top aides so often that government
shake-ups have become a common feature of Russia's politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's decision to substitute the stolid Chernomyrdin for
the reform-minded Sergei Kiriyenko was a stunning one _ even for
the mercurial Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin offered no public explanation Sunday night for his
decision, which was disclosed in a terse statement on the evening
television news, just after the reports on the day's sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
   To many commentators, however, it seemed that the Russian
president had decided that his political survival was more
important than plowing ahead with an aggressive program of economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   While Chernomyrdin, 60, is seen by most of the Russian public as
an uninspiringly figure, he is a consensus figure for much of the
power elite.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial oligarchy sees Chernomyrdin as a far more
sympathetic and pliable leader than the brainy Kiriyenko. The
Russian press has been rife with reports that Boris Berezovsky, the
tycoon and media mogul, was plotting to restore Chernomyrdin to
power.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also appears to be calculating that the appointment of
Chernomyrdin will deflate the repeated calls in the
Communist-dominated parliament for Yeltsin's resignation. As the
former head of the Soviet gas industry, Chernomyrdin has maintained
good relations with the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The same factors that make Chernomyrdin an acceptable leader for
financiers and Communists, however, make him a questionable choice
to extract Russia's from its economic quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   During his first five years as prime minister, Chernomyrdin
presided over Russia's unsteady march toward capitalism. But he
also tolerated much of the cronyism and many of the half-measures
that have helped bring Russia to its current impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin acknowledged as much just last March when he told the
nation that he was firing Chernomyrdin because a new, young team
was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question is whether the return of a veteran
politician like Chernomyrdin would restore a sense of political
stability or add to the feeling that Yeltsin was grasping at straws
in his efforts to cope with the escalating financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian banks on the brink of insolvency and the ruble in
decline, Russia faces a number of critical policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It must decide on a way to restructure its short-term debt. It
must determine how many politically connected banks it can afford
to bail out. It must also find a way to reassure anxious foreign
investors, who have been fleeing in droves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kremlin sought Sunday night to reassure the Clinton
administration that the shake-up was not a economic retreat.
Chernomyrdin and Kiriyenko spoke separately Sunday evening by
telephone with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said that both Russian officials ``put a
strong emphasis on continuing the march.'' But he acknowledged that
the neither provided any specifics or explained the reason for
Yeltsin's move.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian politicians were far less charitable.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Lukin, a leading member of the opposition Yabloko
party, said that Yeltsin's decision was evidence of ``profound
confusion and uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Anders Aslund, a former economic adviser to the Yeltsin
government and a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, described the shake-up as ``a setback on all
fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chernomyrdin helped cause the crisis,'' Aslund added. ``To
bring him pack is like reappointing Suharto in Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, the suddenness of Sunday night's move added a
further, unwelcome element of instability. The last time Yeltsin
dismissed his government, he ended up reappointing most of his top
aides to government posts. But Sunday night's statement did not
make clear which Kremlin aides would be reappointed and which would
be sacked.

ROUTINE APPLICATIONS ERUPTED INTO RACE-TINGED FIGHT OVER YOUTH
MARCH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In late January, New York City received two
applications from a nonprofit organization in Washington seeking
permission to stage a ``First Amendment Educational Event.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the applications were routine if somewhat unclear,
representing only two of the tens of thousands of requests the city
receives every year for block parties, parades and street fairs. In
another sense, the two pieces of paper were the bureaucratic
equivalent to kindling; in the months to come, they would pit an
out-of-town black nationalist who spouts anti-Semitism with a smile
against an outspoken white mayor with few ties to the city's black
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Khalid Abdul Muhammad _ best known for his anti-white
diatribes _ has charged in a lawsuit filed in federal court that
the discriminatory policies of the Giuliani administration prompted
it to deny his application for a Million Youth March in Harlem on
Sept. 5, the Saturday of the hectic Labor Day weekend. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, meanwhile, has alternated between keeping his
counsel and denouncing the event as a poorly planned ``hate march''
that his aides expect will take place in some form, permit or no
permit.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle of this race-tinged quarrel is the
community of Harlem, whose leaders are now bracing for an event
that several of them never wanted. Some criticize Muhammad for
promoting an event that couples, however subtly, the instructive
message of black-youth empowerment with destructive messages of
intolerance. They also say that for all his talk of black unity, he
was woefully late in sharing his plans with most of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me get this straight,'' said Bill Perkins, the community's
City Council member. ``You're going to have a party in my house and
you don't even tell me about it?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, several leaders say Giuliani has used harsh,
simplistic language to describe an event that also stresses pride
in the black community and loving guidance for its young. The mayor
can afford to generalize, they say, because most of his political
support comes from white and conservative communities, far from the
streets of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   These leaders say many people may participate in anti-Giuliani
protest rather than in pro-Muhammad support. After all, they argue,
Muhammad has neither the appeal nor the money to stage a
significant event _ especially when another, better-organized event
for the country's black youths is being held in Atlanta on the same
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any individual who has been more deliberately
destructive than Khalid Muhammad, but what separates him from just
being a racist is that his statements are all calculated to evoke a
reaction,'' said state Sen. David Paterson of Harlem. ``And he
tried to use inflammatory language to dupe Mayor Giuliani into
attacking him. And since Giuliani is an unpopular person in the
African-American community, he then comes back to the community and
plays himself off as a martyr, an Adam Powell who is being
attacked, or a Malcolm X. He disguises himself as the current-day
Adam or Malcolm, when in fact he's a cheap carbon copy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Paterson said, the mayor ``gave the marchers what
they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing such opinions as ``absurd'' on Saturday, Giuliani
used the very language that makes some Harlem leaders cringe. ``We
either had to just ignore it and pretend that a person who has
engaged in the worst kind of rhetoric about Jews, about whites,
about Catholics, about the pope _ that he should be allowed to
carry a banner leading a lot of children. Or we could say something
about it, which we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides leave the First Amendment implications of
blocking the march to be discussed in court, with the next hearing
scheduled for Wednesday. But they maintain that the administration
has wisely handled one of the most delicate, and potentially
volatile, predicaments that a municipality can face. As for the
mayor's occasional comments, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said New
York City was more than just Harlem; there are Jews, Roman
Catholics, gay men and lesbians _ all concerned with the message of
Khalid Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know that the leader of this city is focused,''
he said. ``They want to hear what he's thinking.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At first, no one knew what to think, in part because Muhammad's
plans kept changing. In the applications filed in January, his
aides requested the date of Sept. 19, not Sept. 5; they now say
they want to reach young people before schools and colleges reopen.
One request asked for Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn; the other asked
for Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem. In a third request, organizers
had also asked for Central Park, Randalls Island ``or street.''
</P>
<P>
   If Muhammad's intentions were unclear, his history was not. The
man behind the applications is so virulent in his anti-Semitic,
anti-white speeches that he managed to annoy Louis Farrakhan, the
minister of the Nation of Islam who has also been known to make
anti-Semitic remarks. Since being ousted from the Nation of Islam
hierarchy in 1994, Muhammad has become a college-campus attraction
who commonly refers to Jews as ``bloodsuckers'' and ``hook-nosed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Washington, the discussions between the city and
the organizers began poorly and got worse. After the two sides
failed to agree on a site for the march or a date, Muhammad told
the city in last May or early June that the march would take place
in Harlem over the Labor Day weekend. City officials explained that
more than 100 permits had already been granted for activities in
Harlem for that Saturday, that the before-school sales of local
businesses would be disrupted and that the police for the holiday
weekend were already taxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he tells us what he's going to do,'' Washington
recalled, ``against the will of the city, without permits.'' He
added, ``They virtually hijacked the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Malik Shabazz, a lawyer from Washington and a close aide of
Muhammad's, said the organizers had become frustrated with what
they perceived to be an institutional thwarting of their rights to
free speech. ``Essentially, they were trying to derail the
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By early July, Harlem's leaders had learned from news reports
that an event called the Million Youth March was probably coming to
their neighborhood. They also learned that both the city had been
discussing this possibility for weeks but never called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us felt that they're calling on us to deal with this,
but when we have other issues _ youth issues or other concerns _ we
don't get the calls back,'' Perkins said. ``But overriding that was
the sense of responsibility that this was taking place in our
neighborhood. And regardless of the poor behavior of the mayor, we
had a responsibility to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington dismissed those concerns, saying that notification a
few days earlier would not have changed the dynamics. And there was
another factor. ``The Giuliani administration doesn't negotiate by
consensus,'' he said. ``They're legislators. They don't run
programs, they don't operate the city, with all due respect to
them. Never do we call people and ask for their advice ...''
</P>
<P>
   Paterson said that attitude was both typical and self-defeating.
``No one is denying that he's excellent in lowering the crime rate
and being the catalyst for business and economic development,'' he
said of the mayor. ``Black people are affected by that, too. But he
comes to the table with such a negative understanding of how black
people feel: `They're not going to support me, so I'm not going to
pay attention to their concerns.'''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad issued thinly veiled threats of what might happen if
the city did not relent, and reminisced about bringing 50 armed
followers to a Ku Klux Klan rally in Jasper, Tex., in June. He also
threatened to lead an angry march, including gang members, through
the Jewish neighborhood of Crown Heights in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have radical revolutionary youth who will be coming here,''
he said, ``who will be quite ready and quite prepared in the
numbers of hundreds and thousands and millions to fight this devil
in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani assailed Muhammad as a hatemonger _ correctly, Paterson
said. But he said the mayor had coupled that condemnation with the
denial of the march permit, allowing critics to contend that the
strong-willed mayor was violating constitutional rights to block
yet another message that he found offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, the Rev. Calvin Butts III, a prominent Baptist
minister who was criticized earlier this year for calling Giuliani
a racist, expressed his support for the march, but not for
Muhammad. The mayor seized the opportunity to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have forgotten, but I don't, the hate language he used
in reference to me,'' Giuliani said last Thursday. ``So I would
expect that he would naturally gravitate toward a march that
engages in this kind of hate rhetoric against Jews, against other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterson, Perkins, and others in Harlem saw the mayor's remarks
as gratuitous and inflammatory. Perkins said he immediately told
Washington to deliver a message: ``Tell him to please shut up. Now,
you put it to him the way you think appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear where this fight over the rights to a Saturday in
Harlem will lead. Although most agree that a Million Youth March
would not attract a million people _ organizers predict about
150,000, while city officials expect a much smaller number _ there
remain many questions without answers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of Harlem, an early critic of Muhammad,
declined to say whether the city could have handled the situation
better. He said his time and thoughts would be better spent on
joining others in preparing Harlem for the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sensitive thing,'' he said.

ANGELS POISED TO BATTLE BEASTS OF THE EAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(SLANG) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are places that so many Angels seasons have gone
to die. New York. Boston. Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mention of the 10-game East Coast trip that begins
tonight at Yankee Stadium has caused Angels players and coaches to
shudder at the thought. During the just-concluded homestand, mere
mention of ``the trip'' was met with disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real easy to look ahead to the Yankees, Boston and
Cleveland,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said last Monday. ``But
we've got to take care of business. If we have a big homestand,
it'll take some of the sting away from going on that trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels began the homestand one-half game ahead of Texas,
then went 5-2 against the White Sox, Tigers and Blue Jays and head
into tonight's game against the Yankees with a xx-game lead in the
AL West. It isn't as big a cushion as the Angels would like to
have. After all, Texas had to play the same three beasts of the
East last week and didn't lose much ground to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the tables are turned.
</P>
<P>
   Crunch time begins immediately, because the Angels will play
five games against the Yankees in four days. Two are makeup games
resulting from the falling expansion joint at Yankee Stadium in
April. A day-night doubleheader is scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are on pace to win more games than any team in
baseball history. Yet the Angels start the series as the only team
in baseball not to have a losing record against New York. The
Angels and Yankees have split six games so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people look and see the Yankees are 20 games up and
say, `What motivation do they have?''' said Angels second baseman
Randy Velarde, an ex-Yankee. ``But their motivation is trying to
break the (wins) record. We're not going to catch them off guard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect to win five games in a row (in New York),''
center fielder Jim Edmonds said. ``But we expect to have five
well-played games. We've played well against the Yankees this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it a make-or-break trip and you'll have an argument. No
matter what lies ahead on this trip _ which includes three against
the Red Sox and two against the Indians _ the Angels have
maintained that one-game-at-a-time mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not a make-or-break trip,'' Collins said. ``We have
too many games to play after that. We've still got five games with
Texas. Make-or-break trip? No, but it's a huge trip. Playing the
Yankees five times, you could go 0-5 before you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels don't have the talent the Yankees have, and one could
probably say the same thing about the Angels when compared with
Boston and Cleveland. But there is something about this Angels
team, players are saying.
</P>
<P>
   A season-long rash of injuries has slowed the Angels but not
stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the dead-on talent of other teams I've been
on,'' said pitcher Jack McDowell, formerly of the White Sox,
Yankees and Indians. ``But this team knows how to grind to be
successful. I like this team. It perseveres. It has the aspects
needed to win. This team has been through everything and it's still
scrapping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a guy in the top 10 in home runs or the top 10
in RBIs,'' Collins said. ``But what we do have is guys in the top
10 in effort. And we have seven guys in the top 10 of players who
go from first to third on a single. They've played every night
hard. It's why this is a fun team to watch, a fun team to be
around.''

ANALYSIS: APPOINTMENT SEEN AS YELTSIN'S DESPERATE MOVE TO RESTORE
CREDIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-SHAKEUP, RUSSIA-CHERNOMYRDIN, RUSSIA-REACT) 
(js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ What can you say about a president who fires his
government, then reappoints the prime minister he fired five months
ago, at a moment when his country is teetering on the edge of
financial collapse?
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the latest surprise move by President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia is widely seen as an act of desperation, carried
out at a moment when his political credibility and clout are in
danger of being swept away by Russia's latest financial shock
waves.
</P>
<P>
   One question now is whether Yeltsin is trying to salvage his own
leadership at the expense of the program of economic reform that he
has embraced since coming to power seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another more troubling question is whether Yeltsin, who at 67
has seemed increasingly infirm in rare recent public appearances,
is orchestrating this latest political upheaval himself, or whether
he has already become a figurehead manipulated by unseen forces _
doomed to repeat the pathetic performance of some of the Soviet
Union's last ailing leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden dismissal of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, which
had been rumored in Moscow all weekend, was in itself not so
surprising, considering the political storms that blew up this week
over the government's decision to let the ruble drop in value and
to freeze Russian debts. Kiriyenko, a 36-year-old former banker,
was chosen by Yeltsin in March in part because he had no political
base and was thus free to make unpopular decisions. Sunday night,
he was dismissed essentially for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   In reappointing the 60-year-old Viktor Chernomyrdin, an
old-style Soviet manager, Yeltsin is reaching out to a familiar
political figure, whose ties stretch deep into the back benches of
the anti-Yeltsin opposition in the Russian Parliament and also to
the so-called ``oligarchs,'' as Russia's band of politically
powerful bankers and tycoons are known.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin offers the prospect of a government with a broader
base of political support, which could blunt the opposition, and
quell its unending debate over whether the president should be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Such political calculations, however, do not answer the question
that many Russians have been asking for months now, as they watch
their country lurch from crisis to crisis, waiting for some kind of
political and economic stability so they can get on with their
lives: Is Yeltsin running the country, they ask, and if he isn't,
then who is?
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's action by Yeltsin, taken without explanation and
without a personal appearance by the president, was hardly
reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sign of wild panic in the Kremlin,'' said Aleksei
Melnikov, a spokesman for an opposition party headed by Grigory
Yavlinsky, a liberal reformer who has been one of Yeltsin's most
consistent critics. ``The country is on the threshold of a banking
crisis, and the best they can do is put their prayers on
Chernomyrdin.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksander Livshits, a top Yeltsin economic adviser who resigned
last week as the country went into a monetary tailspin, expressed
loyalty to both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, but his assessment was no
less blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very serious,'' he told a television
interviewer on Sunday night. ``I, as you know, have never been
inclined to panic, but I have to say that in its seriousness, this
is unprecedented in all the years of reform. We have never yet been
in such a situation before.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past two weeks, as Russia's banking crisis ran
headlong into the government's own cash crunch, Yeltsin has used
his annual August vacation to take shelter from the political
fallout. Last weekend, he moved closer to Moscow to consult with
top officials and in the end, gave his approval to the government's
controversial anti-crisis program. But he has yet to step forward _
as he did last May during an earlier crisis _ to take
responsibility and to lend the government his political support.
</P>
<P>
   The president has been openly mocked in much of the Russian
press for his absence. Such contempt for him would have been
unthinkable in the early years of his government, when he still
wore the popular glow he had earned as the leader of the
anti-Communist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, even before he climbed on the tank to rout the
1991 coup, he was the only politician of popular stature who could
wade into a crowd, urging weary Russians to challenge authority and
to take control of their future.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, as people have struggled to figure out the
value of their currency, he was being remembered for having said,
as recently as eight days ago, that the ruble would not be
devalued. He also pledged that day to keep Kiriyenko in his job.
``I will keep him on,'' he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   His behavior during his two public appearances in recent weeks _
at a Novgorod meatpacking plant, and, on Friday, to review naval
exercises off the Arctic circle _ did little to restore public
faith. He stomped through the sausage factory like the Communist
boss he once was and made painfully unphotogenic grimaces during
meetings with sailors aboard a navy cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television viewers have already compared Yeltsin to the
late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in his final years, when his
wooden demeanor became the butt of Russian underground humor. But
in a more sinister view, many analysts were saying Sunday that
Yeltsin, in appointing Chernomyrdin, has revealed himself to be a
captive of the ``oligarchs,'' many of whom are now fighting a
behind-the-scenes battle to save their banks from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been saying that the Chernomyrdin appointment
suggests that economic reformers in Russia have not been strong
enough to hold up to crony capitalism, which they fear will now be
set free to hold the Russian economy hostage to their own private
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Which way the Chernomyrdin government will move is unclear,
despite Chernomyrdin's reassurances to Vice President Al Gore that
he will continue the austere program of economic reform hammered
out last month with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue will be the future of Boris Fyodorov, the
tough-talking director of Russia's tax police, who was named deputy
prime Minister in charge of economic policy last week. Fyodorov,
who resigned once from Chernomyrdin's earlier government, was due
to make an announcement on Monday on restructuring Russia's
domestic debt. The issue has been closely watched by foreign
investors for signs of preference for Russia's beleaguered banks.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Chernomyrdin manages to muddle through the financial
crisis, it may not be enough to save Yeltsin's credibility, or any
hopes he may have held for another run for the presidency in the
year 2000. Even before the summer's tumultuous events, Yeltsin was
clearly losing the support of Russia's media barons, who have been
openly courting other presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Russian public likely to forgive the president for
having left them, as they see it, in the lurch. ``Public trust in
Yeltsin and Kiriyenko was already sinking,'' said Igor Babichev, a
newspaper editor in the central Russian city of Kaluga, late last
week. ``Now it has been completely buried.''

advantage in the wildcard race, their big bat continuing to be MVP
candidate Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>

putting Avery in the rotation but he has struggled there while
Wasdin has had better luck working as a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   _ What's happening this week: Before the season started, many
pointed to this weekend's series between the Yankees and the
Mariners as a big one. But this set means nothing as New York has
36 more wins than Seattle.

   _ The big arms: The Indians may have the third-best ERA in the
league 4.29, but it is significantly higher than the league-leading
Yankees (3.61).
</P>
<P>
   _ The unexpected: Kansas City shortstop Jose Offerman has
reached base in 41 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   _ The injuries: Royals righthander Hipolito Pichardo will miss

have to open the week with Yankees.

the last three years while Ruth hit 161 from 1926-28.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    O'Cain breathes new life into NC State program
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. -- A year ago, you could have gotten any odds you
wanted that North Carolina State would have a new head football
coach by the end of December.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack had become spoiled, stringing together seven
straight bowl appearances from 1988-94 before Mike O'Cain let
things slip in '95 and finished 3-8. When the 'Pack followed with
another 3-8 finish, O'Cain looked to be out the door.
</P>
<P>
   But two things happened last year that enabled the affable State
coach to secure a new five-year deal. The Wolfpack shocked everyone
by opening with a 32-31 win at Syracuse and then, following a
mid-season swoon, finished by outscoring Florida State in the
second half of a game they lost 48-35 and built on that by winning
their last three.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-5 mark didn't net the 'Pack a bowl, but it did give O'Cain
new life.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State enters this season without tailback Tremayne Stephens
and running mate Carlos King, but returns quarterback Jamie
Barnette, All-ACC receiver Torry Holt and most of its offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the 'Pack will be missing six starters, and that
may be more devastating than having to find a new running game.
</P>
<P>
   To add more mystery to what may be a transitional year, Barnette
badly sprained his knee in a tag football game in June and has yet
to get back to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what's to make anyone believe State may be better this year
than last?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure there is anything,'' said O'Cain. ''The only
thing this year, we're going into the season with confidence.
That's something we didn't do last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you get past Holt and a suspect Barnette in the offensive
skills department, there is little to recommend the Wolfpack.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel we've got a sound offensive line,'' said Ian Rafferty,
a 6-6, 300-pound senior tackle. And I think we're going to be able
to run. You can't win just by throwing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question is who's going to run it. Senior Jeff
Butler is penciled in at fullback and junior Rahshon Spikes at
tailback, Spikes rushed for 297 yards last year with six touchdowns
while Burler managed eight yards on six carries.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who set a State record by grabbing 12 passes and scoring
five touchdowns against FSU in State's wild second-half comeback,
must step up early until State develops its running game.
</P>
<P>
   He had 62 catches for 1,099 yards and 16 TDs in '97, but almost
went pro in the spring. ''It's critical we get Holt the ball,''
understated O'Cain. ''Your job as a coach is to get the ball to
people who can do something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt, for his part, is eager. ''I thought about turning pro, but
decided I wasn't ready mentally,'' he said. ''I've got insurance
(for injury) and all that's behind me now. I'm ready to concentrate
on the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, State finished in the bottom half of the ACC last
season and nothing seems to point to a great leap this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a young defensive line, but potentially the best one
we've had in years,'' said Bobbie Cotten, a senior defensive end.
Strong safety Rodney Redd is the leader of a no-name secondary that
may struggle early due to inexperience. ''We've got to take an
us-against-the-world attitude,'' Redd says about playing defense.
''The way America is set up, nobody wants to see defense. They want
to see the long pass or the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just that nobody wants to see State play defense as
it allowed 20-plus points in seven games last season. The forecast
seems to be that O'Cain should be thankful he got his new five-year
deal when he did.
</P>

<P>
   Veronica Delgado got lost on her way from her home in Chino to
the Forum in Inglewood on Sunday morning, so she showed up 40
minutes late to the 8 a.m. open call for Laker girl tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   And they wouldn't let her in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of stinks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica was, in effect, locked out.
</P>
<P>
   Which means at least she has a real grasp, a concept, that
conservatively more than half of the nearly 300 dancers who showed
up knew hardly anything about.
</P>
<P>
   If they're going to be one of the 17 Laker girls this season,
they ought to know their season might consist of personal
appearances at supermarket openings and Jerry Buss's private
functions. At least keep an open calendar until December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously?'' said Richelle South of Calabasas when apprised of
the NBA labor situation. The 18-year-old had just made the first
cut and was actually feeling pretty good about herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just the Lakers? All of basketball?'' she continued. ``I
had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Candy Brown of Los Angeles said: ``Some of my boyfriends told
me, so I heard about it. But I'd bet a lot of the girls here
haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Y'know, just don't worry about it. If you make it to the final
cut, you'll find out soon enough....
</P>
<P>
   __ Laker girl target of affection Shaq Daddy, recently kazammed
by Reebok, told the Philadelphia Daily News that he's going to
start his own shoe line next year. ``I've already got the best
designers and the best marketing group in the world lined up,''
boasted the best actor in Hollywood....
</P>
<P>
   __ The NFL has its first roster cut Tuesday, which means Dallas'
Michael Irvin (fill in your own punch line)....
</P>
<P>
   __ The News Corp. folks issued a statement recently that
ownership and control of the company won't be affected by the
pending divorce of chairman Rupert Murdoch and his future ex-wife
Anna. So that's a go for the ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' this fall....
</P>
<P>
   __ The Dodgers say it's premature to start talking about 'dozing
Dodger Stadium, despite finding out that renovation costs for 60-
to-75 luxury boxes could run about $200 million _ or about as much
as a new facility. That means they'll probably get one more
estimate by Earl Scheib then nuke the palm tree paradise this
winter....
</P>
<P>
   __ Even with the modified Stableford system, Al Davis plus
Donald Sterling in partnership to bring L.A. its most-newest NFL
franchise doesn't add up to anything positive....
</P>
<P>
   __ Those billboards that read ``Why Sundays Should Be Sooner,''
then have the San Diego Chargers helmets on them and a
season-ticket-info phone number ... sssstop, my sides are
splitting....
</P>
<P>
   __ The new name for the conference formed by the eight schools
leaving the Western Athletic Conference won't be supplied by a
corporate sponsor, as has been discussed. Utah athletic director
Chris Hill said the new group will go with ``a more conventional
name.'' Something like the ``Rebels Without A Conference.''...
</P>
<P>
   __ How Mark McGwire gets his groove back: The key is whether
batting practice pitcher Dave McKay, the Cardinals coach who was
also with the Big Bopper in Oakland, is able to throw. Since McKay
has been battling a sore back all season, sometimes to the point he
can't even stand in the first-base box, McGwire doesn't always get
his normal pregame tuneup....
</P>
<P>
   __ C'mon, Black Jack....
</P>
<P>
   __ The Mighty Ducks continue to be nickel-and-dimed by
management whose parent company decides the game is important
enough to throw $600 million in for the TV rights. Sure, that makes
cents....
</P>
<P>
   __ Campbell's commercial updates: John Elway is in as an
endorser. No soup for Reggie White....
</P>
<P>
   __ The early demise of ``The Magic Hour'' doesn't give much hope
for supporters of ``The Shawn Kemp Kiddie Korral'' show....
</P>
<P>
   __ And, please, don't think of ``The Magic Hour'' as a
painful-to-witness show that was canceled by the producers because
of nonexistent ratings. Think of it as the host who has just been
locked out.

   WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 21, the morning the allegations about
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky first
appeared in the news media, the political consultant Dick Morris
was in New York City when his pager went off. The call, Morris said
in an interview, was from the president.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, there had been heated deliberations between
lawyers in the office of the White House counsel, Charles Ruff, and
the White House communications and political team, according to
several current and former White House aides interviewed in the
past week.
</P>
<P>
   A White House adviser said the lawyers wanted the president to
say very little and insisted that the word ``sexual'' not appear in
Clinton's first official statement about Ms. Lewinsky, which was
due to be released by Mike McCurry, the White House press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Several political and communications advisers, who had weathered
previous allegations involving Clinton, were pressing for as much
early candor as possible, the ``more rather than less approach,''
as one of them labeled it in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently torn himself over the best approach, the president
reached out once again to Morris, the political consultant who had
helped orchestrate his comeback from the brink of other disasters,
including the 1994 election that delivered the House to the
Republicans. Morris, whose position as a Clinton insider had been
shattered by his own sexual misconduct in 1996, said he was not
surprised to get the call.
</P>
<P>
   The president told Morris that he had ``slipped up'' with Ms.
Lewinsky but that the charges against him were untrue, Morris said.
The adviser offered to take a poll to see what the attitude of the
voters would be if the president admitted an affair with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before the poll results were back, Clinton proceeded shakily
through a first day of questions, with a vague statement (the
president ``never had any improper relationship'' with Ms.
Lewinsky), and an oddly present-tense response in a PBS interview
(``There is no sexual relationship _ that is accurate.''). In the
following days, backed in part, Morris said, by his polling, the
denials only became more forceful.
</P>
<P>
   All last week, in the wake of the president's belated admission
that he ``did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not
appropriate,'' there has been a barrage of second-guessing about
decisions that were made last January. Should the president have
been more truthful, earlier? Why did he mislead the public for
seven months? Why was he not more apologetic? Why did he use
lawyerly phrases such as ``legally accurate''?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to many of these questions rest in the tension
between the president's political and legal interests and, of
course, inside himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matrix of political and legal considerations in these
cases is beguiling. You can't ever get it just right,'' said
Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who has defended many political
figures and who attended a White House meeting of Democratic
operatives on Wednesday. ``The adversary function of a legal case
rests on saying nothing and making people prove a case. The
political system functions by running at the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   After the PBS interview, with Jim Lehrer, some members of the
political team reacted with horror. One White House adviser said
that Clinton sounded like a zombie programmed by lawyers. Harry
Thomason, the Hollywood producer who had helped orchestrate some of
Clinton's most successful political moments, including his
acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic convention, was so worried
that he called Hillary Rodham Clinton, who encouraged him to come
to Washington, reported an account in The New Yorker. He arrived
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Morris said, he had reported his polling results back
to the president. The public would forgive admission of a sexual
dalliance, but not that the president had been untruthful about it
in his sworn deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones case, which has since been dismissed, was one of two
highly worrisome legal matters closing in on the president back in
January. The other was the continuing investigation by the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Anything the president said
could have serious ramifications on both. The lawyers were also
concerned that if the president provided different versions of the
story, he would be vulnerable to a perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   But the political situation seemed equally precarious. As there
were last week, there were predictions in the early days that the
president would be forced to resign or face impeachment. The
political advisers wanted the president to communicate effectively
with the public.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle, there was a president who, according to his
speech last Monday, was motivated ``by a desire to protect myself
from the embarrassment of my own conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Lehrer interview on Jan. 21, there was a vocal
clash between the political and communications team and the lawyers
in a confrontation that one participant recalls ``bordered on
getting violent.'' A group of aides then confronted Clinton's lead
outside lawyer, David Kendall of Williams &AMP; Connolly, to complain
about the lack of information coming from the lawyers. According to
one aide, Kendall, who did not return a call to comment for this
article, responded sharply to criticisms that he was not
sufficiently sensitive to the president's political needs by saying
that the aides did not understand the obligations of being a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The political advisers, including Rahm Emanuel and Paul Begala,
said a White House adviser sought assurances from the lawyers that
the president's denial of a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
did not rely on an exclusion for oral sex. Last week there was ``an
intense feeling of personal betrayal,'' said a former White House
aide. Several White House aides and advisers said they were
uncertain whether the lawyers knew the assurances were disingenuous
at the time they were given.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Jan. 23, the lawyers, joined by Mickey Kantor, a
longtime adviser and friend of the president and Mrs. Clinton, were
insisting on a wall of silence. McCurry was asked whether the
president had told the full story of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky to his advisers. ``If, by advisers, if that includes his
attorneys, he may have,'' McCurry responded. ``But I can't answer
that, because he has not with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Also that Friday, the president reassured his Cabinet, who
gathered at the White House to discuss the upcoming State of the
Union Address, that he was innocent of allegations of having sex
with an intern and telling her to lie about it. ``I'm going to be
fine, and you will be, too,'' he told them. After the Cabinet
meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and three other
Cabinet secretaries met with reporters in a show of support for
Clinton. By this time, several top political advisers had also been
personally assured by the president that the allegations were
untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Over that weekend there was a barrage of new reports about Ms.
Lewinsky. Clinton conferred with Thomason and watched the Super
Bowl with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. His political situation seemed to
be worsening.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, with help from Thomason, who was watching a live
video feed from another room in the White House, Clinton had
practiced an emphatic, public denial. Wagging his finger and with
his wife standing by his side, Clinton told 200 people gathered in
the Roosevelt Room for a child-care policy meeting, ``I want you to
listen to me, I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual
relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Also present in the Roosevelt Room that day was Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., who found the president's denial reassuring
then, but last week said her faith in the president's credibility
had been ``badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was misleading, a strong and public categorical
denial from the president seemed to bolster both his legal and
political standing back in January. It seemed to give the Jones
lawyers and Starr little to work with. (Ms. Lewinsky was not yet
cooperating with prosecutors and in the Jones case she, too, had
filed an affidavit denying a sexual relationship). His denial also
energized Clinton's defenders, including his wife, who appeared on
the NBC program ``Today'' to defend him.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' poll also made it clear the voters, too, were most
comfortable with a denial, though he was soon excluded from the
group advising the president. A former White House aide said that
when word of Morris' possible reappearance reached Begala, he
threatened to quit if Morris was brought back. Begala declined
comment, while Morris said ``the lawyers felt the president should
not talk to me anymore because our conversations were not
privileged.'' Morris was called before Starr's grand jury last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months of denials, supplemented by a quasi-apology, have
hurt the president legally and politically, several former aides
said, with one saying Clinton turned an embarrassment into a
possibly impeachable offense. But another adviser stressed that the
president bought valuable time, months in which the White House has
denounced Starr and driven up his public disapproval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, the president's public denials about Ms.
Lewinsky were quickly followed by a successful State of the Union
address, which helped remind the voters why they elected Clinton.
Some aides were hoping last week that the president's order to bomb
terrorists' sites could have a similar effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of the past seven months has been heavy, whether or
not the president survives his legal and political troubles.
Current and former aides are only beginning to come to terms with
the fact that the president lied to them, too. In interviews last
week, several sounded deeply anguished.

U.S. OFFERS MORE DETAILS ON ATTACK IN SUDAN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing questions about the U.S. missile attack on a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, the Clinton administration on Sunday
sought to justify the strike by offering more details linking the
factory to the production of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Two administration officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that in the weeks leading up to last Thursday's
strike, the United States had obtained a sample of a critical
chemical used in the making of VX, a deadly nerve agent.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has so far declined to lay out its evidence
publicly except to say there was ``physical evidence'' of the
precursor chemical at the factory, in an industrial area of the
Sudanese capital, Khartoum. The officials declined to name the
chemical, which the administration has classified, but they said it
had no other known use that would explain its presence in the
plant, called the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co.
</P>
<P>
   The United States struck the plant in Sudan and a paramilitary
training camp in Afghanistan on Thursday with a simultaneous
barrage of roughly 75 cruise missiles. President Clinton and his
aides have said the attack was to punish Osama bin Laden, a Saudi
exile that the United States has accused of sponsoring terrorist
attacks, including the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   They have also said they had credible evidence that bin Laden's
organization planned to carry out additional attacks against
Americans. Appearing on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, said the bombings in
Africa were just the start of a campaign orchestrated by bin
Laden's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 7th of August, we saw the attack against the two
embassies, and we had very reliable and convincing information that
might be only the first of two of three or even possibly four
attacks,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the evidence pointing to new attacks did not include
the location of potential targets.
</P>
<P>
   Although administration officials and lawmakers from both
political parties who have seen the evidence have insisted that it
is irrefutable, questions have continued to arise.
</P>
<P>
   In Sudan, the government has insisted that the pharmaceutical
factory was a benign commercial venture and called on the United
Nations to investigate the U.S. strike. On Sunday, government
officials took the chief U.N. representative in Sudan, Phillip
Borel, on a tour of the debris from the factory, which was heavily
damaged in the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The factory was obliterated by the strike, which one U.S.
official said was designed to make the building fall in on itself,
limiting the chance of toxins escaping into the air.
</P>
<P>
   People who toured the area afterward were able to see
pharmaceutical products in the debris. Administration officials do
not dispute that the factory might have had commercial purposes.
The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
Sunday that it would not be readily apparent from the debris that
production of a VX precursor had been under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that anyone visibly can identify what chemicals
might be in and around the vicinity,'' he said Sunday on CNN's
``Late Edition.'' ``There is no question in our mind that that
facility, that factory, was used to produce a chemical that is used
in the manufacture of VX nerve gas and has no other commercial
distribution as far as we understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have physical evidence of that fact,'' he added, ``and
very, very little doubt of it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the administration has been extremely reluctant to
discuss its evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration says the precursor has no other use
than the making of VX, the chemical does not appear on the list of
chemicals covered under the international treaty barring chemical
weapons, said another administration official, who, like the
others, spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   VX is an odorless, colorless liquid. A drop on the skin can
result in death within a matter of minutes. There are different
ways to make it and dozens of chemical precursors that could be
used, many of them with other, benign uses.
</P>
<P>
   Amy E. Smithson of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an arms research
organization in Washington, said it would not take a large amount
of precursor chemicals _ or space _ to make a weapon. But a factory
would have to have special glass-lined reactors and tubes that
would resist corrosion by highly toxic chemicals, she said. ``If
this pharmaceutical facility had corrosion-resistant equipment, it
would be possible to mask small quantities of chemical agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection between the factory and bin Laden is also
unclear. On the day of the attack, Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said bin Laden ``had some financial interest in contributing
to this particular facility.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the link
is not that direct. The plant, they said, was built by a state-run
entity called the Military Industrial Complex, and it is to that
group that bin Laden has connections, not to the factory itself.

U S WEST STRIKE TALKS RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Colo., Idaho, Iowa, Minn., Neb., N.M., N.D., Ore.,
S.D., Utah, Wash., Wyo.)  (lb)

<P>
   DENVER _ A week into a strike against U S West by about 34,000
members of the Communications Workers of America, negotiations
resumed Sunday amid reports of equipment sabotage and accusations
of unfair practices by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Talks continued into the evening without any progress being
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began on Aug. 16 when the union's 3-year contract
expired and agreement could not be reached on the issues of
mandatory overtime, health care and a performance-pay plan. A
federal mediator, Jim Mahon, ordered the two sides to return to the
bargaining table on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The regional telephone company provides service to 25 million
customers in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana,
Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah,
Washington and Wyoming. About two-thirds of its 51,000 workers are
members of the Communications Workers of America. Employees in
Montana are covered by another union and have continued to work.
</P>
<P>
   The union has complained that the company is failing to supply
enough information for the negotiations. For its part, U S West
says the union is not bargaining in good faith, an accusation the
union denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bargaining agents are more than happy to negotiate,'' said
Sharon Cordova, president of Communications Workers of America
Local 7777. ``The resolution that the company wants us to sign off
on is what's on the table, and they don't want to talk otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   A U S West spokesman, David Beigie, made a similar statement.
``As we approached the contract deadline, they had us chasing down
enormous minutiae, very little that had to do with the contract
settlement,'' Beigie said. ``We don't believe they're serious about
getting to a resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the major sticking point is the union's objection
to the proposed performance-pay plan, under which the company's
7,100 technicians would have the option to receive a bonus of up to
20 percent on top of their base salaries for meeting specific
targets, like making a certain number of repair calls in a given
period. The plan would be mandatory for employees hired after Jan.
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new concept in business, and big labor is not happy
about it,'' Beigie said. ``They may want to make an example out of
U S West, and then it's no longer about local phone service in the
Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has also proposed an 18 percent wage increase over
five years, a 20 percent pension increase, the elimination of some
fully paid health-care packages and deductions in overtime pay. The
union says the proposed concessions would hurt customer service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Close to two dozen acts of equipment sabotage have been reported
in Oregon, Colorado and New Mexico since the strike began. Most of
these acts have involved wire and cable boxes being broken into and
wires being cut.
</P>
<P>
   A $10,000 reward has been offered for information about an
incident on Aug. 16, the first day of the strike, in which a large
amount of cable was cut near a hospital in Colorado Springs,
leaving hundreds of customers without service for several hours.
Later in the week, someone poured gasoline down a manhole and set a
nearby phone and cable line on fire near a hospital in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The union has denied any involvement in these incidents.

NORTH TEXAS' HEFTIER OFFENSIVE LINE EXPECTED TO CARRY THE LOAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Jiggling, bouncing and gasping, 1,518 pounds of
starting offensive linemen plodded from end zone to end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen times.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   University of North Texas football coach Darrell Dickey greeted
his players with a stress test before two-a-days began. The stress
was the running. The test was whether the offensive linemen would
endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We survived six days in an R.V. together. We can do this,''
offensive tackle Vinny Patterson said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   From a raucous South Padre trip in a cramped recreational
vehicle to a not-so-neat pad that houses many of them, Patterson
and Co. play together and ``play'' together.
</P>
<P>
   And a strong bond between UNT's big boys might well be enough to
hold together an offense with a new scheme and an inexperienced
quarterback until a bit of confidence can be gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've addressed that topic plenty of times,'' said Phillip
Armour, a three-year starter at center. ``The key to this whole
season, we feel, is us. The whole season is going to rely on us _
the examples we set and how we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this summer lesson No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   All 1,518 aforementioned pounds stayed in Denton to train, a few
living together in a small rented house near campus. That's a lot
of big, hot, sweaty bodies in a small space _ an emphasis on big _
and that's not even mentioning the week in July when the air
conditioning went out.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson weighs in at a healthy 304 pounds while his fellow
starters have a bit of heft, too. Try Armour (300), Shane York
(282), Laymonde Lee (294) and Brad Winn (338) on for size.
</P>
<P>
   A summer of lifting, running and eating had everybody stronger
and healthier by two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've got something we need to develop in our entire
program and in our entire athletic department,'' Dickey said, ``and
that's pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride took a beating for this ensemble during the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Armour, Patterson, Lee and Winn started that season, too.
Expectations were almost as high as now, and by midseason had been
crushed by inconsistency and injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd play a good game and then we'd come back and lay an
egg,'' Eagles offensive line coach Spencer Leftwich said. ``We'd
play a good half. We'd play a bad half.''
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistency proved contagious. UNT rushed for an average of
84.7 yards in seven losses compared to 232.5 yards in its four
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Lee attributes much of that schizophrenic output to
schizophrenic line play.
</P>
<P>
   Guys realized, and Dickey reminded them, inconsistent line play
will bury them this season when a bunch of inexperienced
quarterbacks will be leading UNT.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not blocking, then we can't run. If we're not pass
blocking, then we can't pass and especially with a young
quarterback he can't gain the confidence that he needs,'' Patterson
said. ``So we need to step it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has begun laughing again, thinking of that trip to
South Padre. He has a small laugh for such a big body, but once he
really gets going, laughter ripples through all 304 pounds of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was a lot of big bodies in one place,'' Patterson
admits.
</P>
<P>
   Said Eagles wide out Jay Young: ``I was by far the lightest
person on the trip _ by about 150 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   A 10-hour drive brought them to South Padre where Patterson and
Winn were immediately enticed into a game of tug-of-war. For
competition, four linemen from the University of Texas were
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your ironic twists.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot like the season that awaits them.
</P>
<P>
   The supposedly smaller, weaker guys from UNT were going against
the supposedly bigger, stronger athletes from supposedly bigger,
better State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we get up there and start pulling and pulling,'' Patterson
said, ``and finally we beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson begins laughing again. The irony isn't lost on him.

<P>
   President Clinton's acknowledgment of an inappropriate
relationship with Monica Lewinsky was a focus of sermons in
churches around the nation Sunday. Following are excerpts from
several sermons, as recorded and transcribed by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   `We Are Not Quite Sure Where It Will Take Us'
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Manzelmann, Cornwall Congregational Church,
Cornwall, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some sad and revealing confessions by the president
of these United States. Some may be glad, I suppose, but others may
well be a bit shaken by it. I don't suppose we were really very
surprised by these confessions, but had hoped against hope that it
wasn't so. And we are not quite sure where it will take us. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There are texts about forgiveness which some may want to think
about. And there are texts which bring it home to us as well. Paul
says quite clearly, `We all fall short.' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And Jesus, who never wants us to be too hasty with our
judgments, said, `Do not judge so that you may not be judged
yourself. For with the judgment you make you will be judged, and
the measure you give may be the measure you get.' The words may
sting a bit. Well, he makes it come home, doesn't he? Not just
there, but here. It's endless. It makes us mad. It makes us sad. We
are tired of it. Let us get on with our life together. There are
other, more frightening things to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   `Whatever the Loss, There Can Be an End to Grieving'
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Hardy S. Clemons, First Baptist Church, Greenville,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The sermon was based on 1 Samuel 16:1-3, in which Samuel anoints
David to lead Israel after rejecting many other men deemed
unsuitable:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we never know the answer to our grief will take
until we've gone all the way through the valley and the shadow of
death, but for Samuel in this case, he did find an answer to the
grief that was debilitating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we are aware that Israel is not the only nation
that has grieved over a tall, handsome, brilliant, powerful leader
and his struggles with character and sin. We know something about
that kind of national grief as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot speak for you. I can tell you about my hurt, my
anger, my sorrow, my incredulous unbelief at what we have
experienced in these last days, but I'm not here to talk about that
situation, I'm here to say that whatever the loss that occasions
grief, there can be an end to grieving. This is our hope as
believers. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If grief is ever going to end, it will end when you learn
you've got to do it badly before you do it well. I think we see
that to some extent with Mr. Clinton this week. All sorts of
reactions have come forward about what he should have said and what
he shouldn't have said. I would love to have been a consultant to
him in the writing of that speech. I believe I could have helped
him if he would have let me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also came away from that speech with a genuine respect
for a man who will get up, having looked the nation in the eye and
lied, who looked in our eyes and said, `What I did was not only
inappropriate, it was wrong.' And if he didn't do it to my
satisfaction, I don't think that's as important as that he did do
it.
</P>
<P>
   And I would invite you to apply that to whatever grief you may
be struggling with in your own experience, related to illness,
related to death, related to some other disappointment or loss. It
is very important to do it badly in order to learn to do it well.
Grief will last long enough for us to learn that.''
</P>
<P>
   `Not Judging, Acknowledging Very Painful Truth'
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Nathan D. Baxter, Dean of Washington National Cathedral
</P>
<P>
   ``We may yet have legitimate suspicions about the political
motive of the endless investigations. However, we can no longer
deny that the haunting shadows we have dreaded are indeed much more
the sad reflections of a soul we would love, than the projections
of a partisan body politic which would assault it. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Jesus taught, `Judge not that ye be not judged.' And I
know all too well the truth in St. Paul's words where he says `that
all have sinned, you and I, and fallen short of God's glory.' But
this is not judging, it is acknowledging a very painful truth. I
still believe Mr. Clinton loves his country and I know that he
loves his family, and I know that he loves his God. And I know that
God loves him. But our desire to keep sin private or ignore
immorality is a judgment upon all of us. Unless we acknowledge
moral failing _ without excuse _ the soul of our nation will not
heal. I believe, more importantly, our children will be even more
confused as to whether the truest treasure of our common life as a
nation is found in the state of the economy or the character of our
moral integrity. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that there is a social agreement in human
society, among the children of Eve and Adam. A standard which is
often abused but is still the barometer of our moral life, and that
is modesty. We do expect, including in our sexual matters,
responsible behavior, self-control and respect for the
sensitivities of others. People of faith understand that this
commitment is not just moral but it is also holy _ it is blessed of
God. Responsibility, self-control and respect. This is modesty, our
moral contract as a community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract of modesty belongs in business, it belongs in
religion, it belongs in law, and in the social sector, just as it
does in politics. But we often wink at its abuse in politics
because we say politics is about the negotiating of power, and
therefore we believe that politics by nature is dirty work. But I
know some very fine politicians, and they remind me that politics
is also about stewardship. It is about the stewardship of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately what should make us respect leaders in a democracy
is not simply intelligence, or charisma, or competence with power,
ideology or any professional skill or native gift. The most
important characteristic of leadership in a democracy is the
ability to demonstrate accountable character, morally accountable
character. Ultimately, the real power of politics is moral.''
</P>
<P>
   `It Is Appropriate For Us To Come Together in Prayer'
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Kie Bowman, Hyde Park Baptist Church, Austin, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an interesting week, a challenging time in our
country. Our president is involved in a personal scandal that could
end up disgracing the personal office of the president. This puts
us at risk as a nation. Therefore it is appropriate for us to come
together in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As de Tocqueville told us, America is great because America is
good. And he said that America will only continue to be great only
as long as it is good. Today, we need to pray for this nation. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, we lift our president before you today. As 1 Timothy
Chapter 2 tells us, we are to pray for our leaders. So Lord, I lift
the president of our country before you. Give him moral courage and
give him wisdom.''

COMMENTARY: POLITICS DRESSED AS LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Word in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is not the first president whose sexual behavior
has become an issue. That distinction belongs to Thomas Jefferson,
whose political opponents charged that he had fathered children by
his slave Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson survived those attacks. But suppose he had been
pursued by a prosecutor who supported the opposition party and
believed Jefferson was evil. Suppose the prosecutor had had
limitless money. Suppose he had forced Sally Hemings to testify,
called Jefferson's aides and friends and subpoenaed the president.
How much of that would Jefferson have borne?
</P>
<P>
   The point of the historical musing is simple. We are gripped by
the story of Clinton's folly and lies. But something much more
dangerous to our country has happened. We have a new form of
politics dressed as law, and it has done terrible damage to the
institution of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It began with the Supreme Court's mistaken decision that Paula
Jones could press her lawsuit against Clinton while he was in
office. The suit was supported by the money of the extreme
political right. With enough money, political opponents can bring a
lawsuit against any president _ and, win or lose, harass him for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Money is crucial also in the role of the independent counsel.
Prosecutors have enormous power. Given the breadth of our criminal
law, they can find reason to prosecute just about anybody if they
have no limit of time or money. No prosecutor should have an
unlimited budget.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr has no limit on what he can spend or how long he
can go on. He can not only draw unlimited public funds for his
office, but continues to earn millions for himself in private
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has set a precedent especially menacing to the presidency
by his obsessive intrusion into private matters. No prosecutor of
good judgment would have forced Secret Service agents and the
president's lawyers to testify. Starr's desire to get Bill Clinton
has made it harder for all presidents to have confidential
conversations, harder to live a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his deputies have pressed intimate sexual questions
not only on Clinton but on other grand jury witnesses. Starr is
living proof of Sigmund Freud's thesis that all children are dying
to know what goes on behind the doors of their parents' bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't about sex, Starr's defenders say; it is about
perjury. No, it isn't. It is about politics.
</P>
<P>
   If a malignant gossip like Linda Tripp had gone to any other
prosecutor in this country with a story that someone had falsely
denied a sexual relationship in a deposition, the prosecutor would
have sent her and her tapes packing. Prosecutions for false
testimony in civil cases are virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Starr acted on Mrs. Tripp's advice, and without
legal authority wired her for an encounter with Monica Lewinsky, is
that he saw a chance to destroy Bill Clinton. That is also the
reason that he or his colleagues have unlawfully leaked to the
press, as a judge has found prima facie reason to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Clinton to testify before the grand jury was a wholly
political act. Federal guidelines tell prosecutors not to subpoena
the targets of investigations; they will invoke the Fifth
Amendment. But Starr knew that the president could not, for
political reasons, rest on that constitutional protection.
</P>
<P>
   I think Starr had no legal power to subpoena the president. The
Constitution speaks of prosecution of a president  &UR; after &LR;  his
removal from office by impeachment and conviction. And that is
generally interpreted to bar prosecution before impeachment. If
Starr cannot prosecute the president, the Constitution surely also
bars subpoenaing him as a target. But Starr knew that politics
would bar Clinton from making that argument.
</P>
<P>
   The president should not be above the law, it is said. Exactly
so. But ``the law'' that applies to a president's wrongdoing is
specified in the Constitution. It is the political process of
impeachment, resting in Congress: a public, not a secret, process.
</P>
<P>
   Disguising politics as law in this way is profoundly
anti-constitutional. It allows unelected, and unelectable, forces
to destroy a president. Our system will be unalterably changed if
we permit the likes of Paula Jones, Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr
to determine our destiny.

`BLADE' CARVES OUT TOP SPOT AT WEEKEND BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' California news file.) 
By DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wesley Snipes' ``Blade'' sliced up rivals for an
easy victory at the nation's box office with an estimated $16.8
million at 2,322 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in five weekends that the slate had not
been topped by Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which
finished a strong second with $10.1 million at 2,671 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade,'' based on a Marvel Comics hero who is part vampire,
received a strong publicity push from New Line dating back to early
summer. Analysts credited the studio with a savvy campaign that
overcame mixed reviews and an ``R'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Line has to be relieved since they opened `Blade' during
what's traditionally the dead end of summer,'' said Arthur Rockwell
of Drake &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of Reel Source, said the film drew
surprisingly well among females and projected ``Blade,'' which
carried an estimated $45 million price tag, will reach $50 million
by the end of its domestic run.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum noted that New Line has managed to generate strong
results from late-summer releases of similar properties such as
``Mortal Kombat'' and ``Spawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They really own this period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Line distribution chief Al Shapiro said ``Blade'' topped
internal estimates by $3 million to $4 million and drew well from
all demographic groups and regions. He credited strong efforts by
Snipes and co-star Stephen Dorff to promote the movie and added
that a sequel is not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a sequel weren't under consideration before, it probably is
now,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The second-place finish by ``Saving Private Ryan'' gave
DreamWorks' D-Day epic $142.7 million after 31 days, placing it
64th on the list of all-time domestic grossers after ``The Santa
Clause.''
</P>
<P>
   Its weekend-to-weekend drop was a mere 23 percent and trackers
believe its final take will top $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we'll continue to see `Saving Private Ryan' play well
for some time,'' said distribution executive Don Harris. ``People
have really responded to this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's sixth weekend of ``There's Something About
Mary'' performed the impressive feat of rising one spot in the
chart to third place with $7.6 million at 2,189 sites to pull its
total to $103.9 million after 40 days. ``This film has tremendous
repeat business,'' Rockwell noted.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy, made for a minimal $25 million, became the ninth
1998 release to cross the $100 million barrier, joining ``Deep
Impact,'' ``Godzilla,'' ``The Truman Show,'' ``Mulan,'' ``Dr.
Dolittle,'' ``Armageddon,'' ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan.'' ``Mary'' is the 175th movie to hit the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's second weekend of ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' came
in a respectable fourth, with $6.4 million at 1,398 locations,
followed by Paramount's third weekend of ``Snake Eyes,'' with $5.1
million at 2,642 screens, and its lukewarm opening of collegiate
comedy ``Dead Man on Campus,'' with $4.7 million at 1,797 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a close seventh was Fox's fourth weekend of ``Ever
After'' with $4.6 million at 1,867 sites, followed by Sony's
opening of ``Dance With Me'' starring Vanessa Williams, with $4.5
million at 1,467 locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think Sony is a little disappointed,'' Rockwell said
of the latter entry.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell noted that studios releasing late-summer movies often
have to settle for second-tier titles such as ``Dead Man on
Campus'' or ``Dance With Me'' in order to keep a continued flow of
new titles for mutliplexes.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fourth weekend of ``The Parent Trap'' continued to draw
solid numbers in ninth, with $3.9 million at 2,169 theaters to go
past $51 million. Warner's second weekend of ``The Avengers''
limped home 10th with $3.6 million at 2,466 theaters as the
action-fantasy _ recipient of some of the most scathing reviews in
memory _ suffered a stunning 65 percent drop from its opening
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Avengers' is a movie that should have never been made,''
Rockwell said of the $60 million project.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros., which has seen most of its films underperform
expectations during the past two years, received more bad news this
weekend as its opening of Leslie Nielsen's spoof ``Wrongfully
Accused'' was nearly dead on arrival in 12th place with $3.4
million at 2,062 theaters. Miramax's third weekend of ``Halloween:
H20'' finished 11th with $3.5 million at 2,360 sites and has topped
$47 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's eighth weekend of ``Armageddon'' was 13th with $2.6
million at 1,423 theaters and reached $184.9 million. It ranks 28th
on the all-time domestic list behind ``Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs.''
</P>
<P>
   Two new entries posted impressive results in limited release _
Gramercy's ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' Neil LaBute's
exploration of infidelity, took in $340,000 at 32 screens, and
Miramax's romantic comedy ``Next Stop: Wonderland'' grossed
$120,000 at eight theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business has reached $4.4 billion and is close to
$500 million, or 13 percent, ahead of the same period last year.
Summer business, from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day, is on
track to hit $2.5 billion, or about 12 percent up from last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's ``Titanic,'' which is responsible for much of the
1998 gains, drew $570,000 at 570 theaters in its 36th weekend to
push its overall domestic total to $599.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade'' and ``Saving Private Ryan'' face competition next
weekend from Miramax's opening ``54,'' starring Mike Myers and Neve
Campbell in a disco re-creation of the rise and fall of Studio 54,
and Warner's debut of ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' a look at the
life of the late Frankie Lyman. Bucksbaum said ``54'' has a decent
shot at topping the slate at about $10 million due to the star
power of its leads.

 &HT;    Man's heart 'beautiful' after 50 years of study
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On Sept. 27, the city of Framingham,
Mass., will honor the 10,000-plus men and women who have taken part
in the largest, longest and most productive study of heart disease
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   After careful consideration, Samuel Seltzer has decided not to
make the trip from his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he says, waving the very idea out the window. ``What do
I wanna do that for?''
</P>
<P>
   The famous Framingham Heart Study turned 50 this year, and
Seltzer turned 103.
</P>
<P>
   Both are still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, when the U.S. Public Health Service decided to study
heart disease, Framingham was chosen because it offered a stable
population with low unemployment, an ethnic mix and proximity to
Boston's teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer was 53 at the time, a native of Russia who came to the
United States in 1919. _ ``It cost me $52.'' He'd started out with
a horse and cart, peddling clothes around Framingham, and worked
hard until he owned a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't ask me much,'' he remembers. ``They wouldn't take
my wife, but they liked me. They checked me a lot of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the study agreed to be examined every two years.
After his wife's death in 1969, Seltzer moved to Long Island, N.Y.,
then to Century Village, Fla. in 1977. His examinations became
infrequent, but the study sent a nurse to examine him four years
ago, while he was visiting his children on Cape Cod, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart, they told me it's beautiful,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But not the oldest heart they've ever seen. Esta Shindler, a
study spokeswoman, says that honor goes to a woman three months
older than Seltzer, who's confined to a Canadian nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   But people listen when a 103-year-old man who still lives alone
offers health tips:
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, I go to bed at 7 p.m., and I'm up at 5 a.m.,'' he
explains. ``When it's clear, I walk a quarter-mile to services
every morning. Then I come back and have breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is All-Bran, Raisin Bran or Cheerios, a slice of
pumpernickel bread and _ this is important _ juice diluted with a
little water.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch is fruit cocktail or cottage cheese, with a slice of
pumpernickel and a glass of milk _ diluted with a little water.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, boiled eggs and tuna fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take much ice cream,'' Seltzer says with a shrug. ``A
little vanilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than a sip or two of wine at Passover, he has not drunk
alcohol, and he never smoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' he says, holding up a finger for attention,
``I didn't eat what I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   During Seltzer's 103 years, he has seen America change from a
place where horse carts were common to a place men leave to walk on
the moon.
</P>
<P>
   What's the most impressive change he's seen?
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer thinks a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to buy a suit of clothes for $30,'' he says. ``Now
you'd pay $90.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, listen,'' he says, ``I'm doing the best I can, and
whenever it comes, I'm ready. I live from day to day. I don't
expect miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   The clock says 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be in bed by now,'' Seltzer says.

 &HT;    Man's heart 'beautiful' after 50 years of study
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving on (a) general news and (l) lifestyle categories.)

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On Sept. 27, the city of Framingham,
Mass., will honor the 10,000-plus men and women who have taken part
in the largest, longest and most productive study of heart disease
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   After careful consideration, Samuel Seltzer has decided not to
make the trip from his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he says, waving the very idea out the window. ``What do
I wanna do that for?''
</P>
<P>
   The famous Framingham Heart Study turned 50 this year, and
Seltzer turned 103.
</P>
<P>
   Both are still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, when the U.S. Public Health Service decided to study
heart disease, Framingham was chosen because it offered a stable
population with low unemployment, an ethnic mix and proximity to
Boston's teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer was 53 at the time, a native of Russia who came to the
United States in 1919. _ ``It cost me $52.'' He'd started out with
a horse and cart, peddling clothes around Framingham, and worked
hard until he owned a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't ask me much,'' he remembers. ``They wouldn't take
my wife, but they liked me. They checked me a lot of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the study agreed to be examined every two years.
After his wife's death in 1969, Seltzer moved to Long Island, N.Y.,
then to Century Village, Fla. in 1977. His examinations became
infrequent, but the study sent a nurse to examine him four years
ago, while he was visiting his children on Cape Cod, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart, they told me it's beautiful,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But not the oldest heart they've ever seen. Esta Shindler, a
study spokeswoman, says that honor goes to a woman three months
older than Seltzer, who's confined to a Canadian nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   But people listen when a 103-year-old man who still lives alone
offers health tips:
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, I go to bed at 7 p.m., and I'm up at 5 a.m.,'' he
explains. ``When it's clear, I walk a quarter-mile to services
every morning. Then I come back and have breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is All-Bran, Raisin Bran or Cheerios, a slice of
pumpernickel bread and _ this is important _ juice diluted with a
little water.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch is fruit cocktail or cottage cheese, with a slice of
pumpernickel and a glass of milk _ diluted with a little water.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, boiled eggs and tuna fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take much ice cream,'' Seltzer says with a shrug. ``A
little vanilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than a sip or two of wine at Passover, he has not drunk
alcohol, and he never smoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' he says, holding up a finger for attention,
``I didn't eat what I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   During Seltzer's 103 years, he has seen America change from a
place where horse carts were common to a place men leave to walk on
the moon.
</P>
<P>
   What's the most impressive change he's seen?
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer thinks a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to buy a suit of clothes for $30,'' he says. ``Now
you'd pay $90.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, listen,'' he says, ``I'm doing the best I can, and
whenever it comes, I'm ready. I live from day to day. I don't
expect miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   The clock says 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be in bed by now,'' Seltzer says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A shy 28-year-old from South Central, Yolanda
Manuel makes a meager living as a public school cafeteria worker.
Yet anytime she clears her throat to speak these days, television
news crews rush to capture her every word.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Ms. Manuel has become another sad symbol
of every parent's worst nightmare and of a mother's grim
determination to protect her child, even after death.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Manuel's 7-year-old daughter, Sherrice Iverson,
was sexually assaulted, strangled and left in a toilet in a Nevada
casino, 43 miles south of Las Vegas. On Aug. 31, jury selection is
scheduled to begin in Las Vegas in the trial of Jeremy Strohmeyer,
a 19-year-old from Long Beach, who police say confessed to the
crime but later pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manuel wants Strohmeyer's best friend, David Cash, 19, a
prosecution witness, to stand trial as well, because he saw at
least the initial stages of the attack and did not go for help.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she has become the spiritual leader of what she calls a
campaign for justice to pressure the authorities to bring charges
against Cash, a college sophomore. The campaign has attracted a
coalition of supporters rare in this era of polarization: blacks,
whites, Jews, Christians, Muslims, radio talk-show hosts,
conservatives and liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't a race issue,'' Ms. Manuel, who is black,
explained. ``This ain't a political issue. It's a human being
issue. It's a justice issue for a little girl who will never be
able to reach for her goals. My baby won't ever get to go to
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Strohmeyer and Cash are both white.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say that Cash was with Strohmeyer at the Primadonna
Resort and Casino in Primm, Nev., in the early morning of May 25,
1997. Cash has said that he briefly watched Strohmeyer in the
women's bathroom and tried to persuade him to stop struggling with
the child in a stall, before leaving to wait outside. The police
say Sherrice was assaulted and killed in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The police and prosecutors say that though Cash apparently
played no role in the slaying of Sherrice, he did not make any
effort to save her or to go for help. Nor did he notify police of
the crime, even after Strohmeyer emerged from the bathroom and told
him what he had just done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morally,'' said Najee Ali, a South Central community leader
who is acting as Ms. Manuel's spokesman, ``David Cash has the blood
of Sherrice Iverson on his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Legally, however, Cash's hands appear to be clean, according to
the Clark County district attorney's office. The county prosecutor,
Stewart Bell, who is trying the case against Strohmeyer, said that
under Nevada law, it is not illegal to fail to report a crime.
Therefore, Cash is free to go on with his life, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cash told the Los Angeles Times last month: ``I'm not going
to get upset over somebody else's life. I just worry about myself
first.''
</P>
<P>
   That remark and others, including one about being able to get
dates with women more easily because of his notoriety, enraged Ms.
Manuel and her supporters. They began a petition drive a few weeks
ago seeking to have Clark County authorities charge Cash in the
death of Sherrice Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal was 10,000 signatures. At a news conference Friday,
Ali announced that the group had collected 20,000 signatures, which
he said he will present to the authorities on the first day of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Ofari Hutchinson, the author of several books about race
and class and a radio talk-show host, is another spokesman for Ms.
Manuel. At the news conference, he announced yet another petition
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The new petition is seeking to have the Nevada Legislature enact
a ``Sherrice Iverson memorial bill'' that would make it a crime for
anyone who witnesses or has knowledge of a sexual attack against a
minor to fail to report it to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said the group also intends to seek a similar ``good
Samaritan'' law on the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't rest,'' he said, ``until we get justice for
Sherrice.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cash is about to begin his second year at the
University of California at Berkeley and two other radio talk-show
hosts have organized a bus load of demonstrators to travel to
Berkeley from Los Angeles on Tuesday night to demand that the
school expel Cash.
</P>
<P>
   Such action by the university appears unlikely, because Cash has
not been charged or convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, who was admitted to Berkeley two months before Sherrice
was killed, did not return a telephone call to his home in Long
Beach and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manuel said she intends to join the protest at Berkeley
because ``David Cash shouldn't be able to get on with his life like
nothing ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure can't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the authorities, Cash followed Strohmeyer into the
bathroom just as his friend was carrying Sherrice into one of the
stalls, his hand over her mouth. Strohmeyer locked the stall door
and Cash hoisted himself up and looked over the stall wall,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Strohmeyer, authorities said, was taking off the child's
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Cash told the grand jury investigating the case that he tried
for several seconds to get Strohmeyer's attention and to get him to
leave. But Strohmeyer ignored him and Cash quickly left and waited
outside for his friend to come out, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The young men were at the casino with Cash's father. Sherrice
was there with her father and her 14-year-old half brother.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, the district attorney, said there was no evidence that
Cash helped kill Sherrice. He said that according to the casino's
surveillance videotape, Cash stayed in the bathroom for less than
two minutes, while Strohmeyer was inside for nearly 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cash was there, Hutchinson said, and he should have been
charged. The police would have charged Cash if he had been black or
Hispanic, said Hutchinson, who is black. The authorities deny the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't deny that race has a role in this case,'' Hutchinson
said. ``But the mother doesn't want to bring it in. And that makes
sense. After O.J., as soon as you mention race, you've polarized,
you've drawn a line in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the moment race is mentioned, Ms. Manuel shakes her head
no. She said she has personally collected 300 signatures from
people of all races across the city, especially from other mothers
who have had the same nightmares and dreams. They stop her on the
street and hug her or call her on the telephone and speak words of
encouragement until they begin to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers know what I'm going through,'' Ms. Manuel said. ``I'm
never going to stop hurting. I've almost had four nervous
breakdowns since Sherrice was murdered. I'm tired, so tired. But I
got to keep going. I got to get justice for my baby.''

U.S. EXPECTED TO SEEK SCOTTISH TRIAL IN HAGUE FOR PAN AM SUSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: This story, eliminated earlier, is now restored) 
(jw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is expected to announce
on Monday a proposal to create a Scottish court in the Netherlands
to try two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade ago, U.S. officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has arranged a conference call Monday morning
from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National Security
Adviser Samuel Berger to relatives of the victims to tell them of
the decision, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that Libya will accept the American proposal,
although it is close to an alternative the Libyans had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to hold a trial in The Hague, but under Scottish law
and presided over by Scottish judges, was floated by the United
States and Britain a month ago. It represents a turnaround for the
administration, which had previously said that the Libyans would
have to be tried either in the United States or in Scotland for the
December 1988 bombing, which killed 259 people on the plane and 11
others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said the proposal seemed a reasonable
compromise. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, has been campaigning to
lift the United Nations economic sanctions imposed on Tripoli
because of its refusal to hand over the two men, both Libyan
intelligence agents, for trial. Gadhafi has proposed that the men
be tried under Scottish law, though not in Scotland, by a panel of
international judges, and he wants sanctions lifted once a trial
begins.
</P>
<P>
   American officials insisted that the idea of Scottish judges in
a trial under Scottish rules was ``non-negotiable,'' and said
holding it in The Hague mattered less. The proposal would call
Gadhafi's bluff, another official said, and if he refused,
sanctions would remain.
</P>
<P>
   But the relatives of some victims expressed concern that the
administration would weaken its conditions. Susan and Daniel Cohen
of Cape May Court House, N.J., whose only child, Theodora, then 20,
died in the bombing, oppose a compromise and said they were
skeptical that the administration would keep its word.
</P>
<P>
   ``This compromise is a slippery slope,'' Cohen said, ``and any
terrorist could now say, `I don't want to be tried in the U.S., I
want to be tried in Bosnia or wherever.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen said that with British corporate pressure high to
resume business with Libya, ``I have the terrible feeling we're
being hustled here'' and that sanctions will be lifted prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much is being made of these two individuals, and not
enough is made of the fact that they are part of a government
apparatus in Libya,'' Mrs. Cohen said. ``Berger and Albright told
us personally that we can't move unilaterally against a terrorist
country like Libya, that we need international support. But they
just did it in Afghanistan and Sudan, which just makes this all
more bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said the proposal had found support
within the Organization for African Unity and the Arab League, and
that Washington would press them to go public and urge Libya to
comply.

EXCERPTS FROM SERMONS ON CLINTON'S SPEECH

<P>
   President Clinton's acknowledgment of an inappropriate
relationship with Monica Lewinsky was a focus of sermons in
churches around the nation Sunday. Following are excerpts from
several sermons, as recorded and transcribed by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   `We Are Not Quite Sure Where It Will Take Us'
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Manzelmann, Cornwall Congregational Church,
Cornwall, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some sad and revealing confessions by the president
of these United States. Some may be glad, I suppose, but others may
well be a bit shaken by it. I don't suppose we were really very
surprised by these confessions, but had hoped against hope that it
wasn't so. And we are not quite sure where it will take us. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There are texts about forgiveness which some may want to think
about. And there are texts which bring it home to us as well. Paul
says quite clearly, `We all fall short.' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And Jesus, who never wants us to be too hasty with our
judgments, said, `Do not judge so that you may not be judged
yourself. For with the judgment you make you will be judged, and
the measure you give may be the measure you get.' The words may
sting a bit. Well, he makes it come home, doesn't he? Not just
there, but here. It's endless. It makes us mad. It makes us sad. We
are tired of it. Let us get on with our life together. There are
other, more frightening things to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   `Whatever the Loss, There Can Be an End to Grieving'
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Hardy S. Clemons, First Baptist Church, Greenville,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The sermon was based on 1 Samuel 16:1-3, in which Samuel anoints
David to lead Israel after rejecting many other men deemed
unsuitable:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we never know the answer to our grief will take
until we've gone all the way through the valley and the shadow of
death, but for Samuel in this case, he did find an answer to the
grief that was debilitating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we are aware that Israel is not the only nation
that has grieved over a tall, handsome, brilliant, powerful leader
and his struggles with character and sin. We know something about
that kind of national grief as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot speak for you. I can tell you about my hurt, my
anger, my sorrow, my incredulous unbelief at what we have
experienced in these last days, but I'm not here to talk about that
situation, I'm here to say that whatever the loss that occasions
grief, there can be an end to grieving. This is our hope as
believers. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If grief is ever going to end, it will end when you learn
you've got to do it badly before you do it well. I think we see
that to some extent with Mr. Clinton this week. All sorts of
reactions have come forward about what he should have said and what
he shouldn't have said. I would love to have been a consultant to
him in the writing of that speech. I believe I could have helped
him if he would have let me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also came away from that speech with a genuine respect
for a man who will get up, having looked the nation in the eye and
lied, who looked in our eyes and said, `What I did was not only
inappropriate, it was wrong.' And if he didn't do it to my
satisfaction, I don't think that's as important as that he did do
it.
</P>
<P>
   And I would invite you to apply that to whatever grief you may
be struggling with in your own experience, related to illness,
related to death, related to some other disappointment or loss. It
is very important to do it badly in order to learn to do it well.
Grief will last long enough for us to learn that.''
</P>
<P>
   `Not Judging, Acknowledging Very Painful Truth'
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Nathan D. Baxter, Dean of Washington National Cathedral
</P>
<P>
   ``We may yet have legitimate suspicions about the political
motive of the endless investigations. However, we can no longer
deny that the haunting shadows we have dreaded are indeed much more
the sad reflections of a soul we would love, than the projections
of a partisan body politic which would assault it. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Jesus taught, `Judge not that ye be not judged.' And I
know all too well the truth in St. Paul's words where he says `that
all have sinned, you and I, and fallen short of God's glory.' But
this is not judging, it is acknowledging a very painful truth. I
still believe Mr. Clinton loves his country and I know that he
loves his family, and I know that he loves his God. And I know that
God loves him. But our desire to keep sin private or ignore
immorality is a judgment upon all of us. Unless we acknowledge
moral failing _ without excuse _ the soul of our nation will not
heal. I believe, more importantly, our children will be even more
confused as to whether the truest treasure of our common life as a
nation is found in the state of the economy or the character of our
moral integrity. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that there is a social agreement in human
society, among the children of Eve and Adam. A standard which is
often abused but is still the barometer of our moral life, and that
is modesty. We do expect, including in our sexual matters,
responsible behavior, self-control and respect for the
sensitivities of others. People of faith understand that this
commitment is not just moral but it is also holy _ it is blessed of
God. Responsibility, self-control and respect. This is modesty, our
moral contract as a community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract of modesty belongs in business, it belongs in
religion, it belongs in law, and in the social sector, just as it
does in politics. But we often wink at its abuse in politics
because we say politics is about the negotiating of power, and
therefore we believe that politics by nature is dirty work. But I
know some very fine politicians, and they remind me that politics
is also about stewardship. It is about the stewardship of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately what should make us respect leaders in a democracy
is not simply intelligence, or charisma, or competence with power,
ideology or any professional skill or native gift. The most
important characteristic of leadership in a democracy is the
ability to demonstrate accountable character, morally accountable
character. Ultimately, the real power of politics is moral.''
</P>
<P>
   `It Is Appropriate For Us To Come Together in Prayer'
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Kie Bowman, Hyde Park Baptist Church, Austin, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an interesting week, a challenging time in our
country. Our president is involved in a personal scandal that could
end up disgracing the personal office of the president. This puts
us at risk as a nation. Therefore it is appropriate for us to come
together in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As de Tocqueville told us, America is great because America is
good. And he said that America will only continue to be great only
as long as it is good. Today, we need to pray for this nation. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, we lift our president before you today. As 1 Timothy
Chapter 2 tells us, we are to pray for our leaders. So Lord, I lift
the president of our country before you. Give him moral courage and
give him wisdom.''

   NEW YORK _ When Al Leiter came to the bench in the middle of the
seventh inning Sunday, Mets' pitching coach Bob Apodaca sat beside
him and presented him with the facts. He had thrown 133 pitches, he
was due to hit third in the inning and the Mets were trailing by a
run, so he was through for the day.
</P>
<P>
   That did not stop Leiter from pleading his case. It was a
powerful one, as he was seemingly growing stronger with every
pitch, striking out seven consecutive batters from the fifth to the
seventh innings. But Apodaca and Manager Bobby Valentine overruled
the request and sent Todd Hundley out to pinch-hit right-handed
against Brian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley walked, but was stranded. Turk Wendell, who had been
pitching flawlessly of late, entered the game and surrendered what
turned out to be the deciding run in the eighth, as the Mets fell
to the Arizona Diamondbacks by 4-3 at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   However logical his decision seemed, Valentine met reporters'
queries about it failing with little patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys must watch TV,'' he said, rising from his desk and
abruptly ending the interview. ``You can't come up with this on
your own. It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's irate reaction came two days after he absorbed
second-guessing for deciding to wait before pinch-hitting Mike
Piazza in a 10-5 loss to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley entered the game hitting .063 against left-handers this
season (just 1 hit in 16 at-bats) and Leiter was pitching well. The
Mets had won all six of Leiter's previous starts since he came back
quickly from a torn patellar tendon in his left knee, and 12 of his
last 13 starts over all. On this day, he had recovered from a rocky
start, and after the Diamondbacks' Andy Fox reached third with one
out in the fifth inning, Leiter struck out the next seven batters.
He walked Fox in the seventh with two outs, but got Bernard Gilkey
to fly out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what my pitch count was,'' Leiter said. ``I'd
settled down. Any time you're feeling as good as I was, you want to
pitch. It was fine, but I definitely asked Apodaca if I'd be able
to go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, I felt pretty good, but it's probably right. I
think you have to factor in that I threw a lot of pitches in my
last start, and if Hundley pops one out of here. That deep in the
game, it's a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   This turned out to be one of those frustrating days in which the
Mets could only watch the scoreboard, see the Cubs fall further and
further behind in a game that they eventually lost, 13-3, to the
Houston Astros, and see an opportunity slip away. The loss left the
Mets one game in front of the Cubs in the National League wild-card
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets still had more than enough opportunities in this game.
After falling behind 3-0, they closed the gap to 3-2 in the fourth
inning on a leadoff home run by Edgardo Alfonzo, which was followed
by a double by John Olerud and a sacrifice fly by Brian McRae. In
the sixth, the Mets had runners on first and second with nobody out
and the heart of the order coming up. But Olerud was retired on a
pop-up to short, Piazza struck out looking and, after McRae was hit
by a pitch, Jermaine Allensworth hit a soft flare to right field
that Yamil Benitez made a sliding grab on to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close, but no cigar,'' Valentine said. ``It was one of those
days. We had opportunities, but didn't cash in. They cashed in most
of theirs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Leiter kept them close, Wendell, who had not given up a
run in his last 11 appearances, was finally touched. After striking
out the first two batters he faced, he waited while home plate
umpire Bill Hohn argued with Matt Williams over a called third
strike before ejecting him. Jay Bell then doubled to right-center,
and Tony Batista followed with a run-scoring double into the
left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Again, in the ninth, the Mets had their opportunities. McRae led
off with a single, and Lenny Harris followed with a pinch-hit
single to left. Luis Lopez dropped a pretty two-strike bunt down
the third-base line, and when reliever Gregg Olson tried to field
and throw to first, he slipped, loading the bases with none out.
But Olson got pinch-hitter Matt Franco looking on three pitches.
Carlos Baerga grounded softly to first, scoring a run and bringing
up Tony Phillips with runners on second and third with two out. But
on a full count, Phillips grounded out to second, ending the game.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the pinch-hitters in the ninth batted left-handed,
but Valentine defended his decision to use Hundley earlier from the
right side. ``I had my right guys up,'' he said. ``I've got guys
who have come up and gotten pinch-hits lefty. Todd hasn't.''

 &HT;    What's a (black and blue) guy to do? Not sit out, 'Big Cat'
offers
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Andres Galarraga has this recommendation for NL
president Leonard Coleman: ''No suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Galarraga thinks he deserves for charging the mound
Saturday after Darren Dreifort hit him with a pitch for the second
time in a week, then missing with a Big Cat left hook that emptied
both benches and led to Galarraga's ejection. Coleman will begin
his inquiry into the incident today and his decision _ likely a
suspension, three games _ is expected later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   But Galarraga, who served a three-game suspension last season
after a similar incident following a Dennis Cook drilling, thinks
he shouldn't miss a single game.
</P>
<P>
   ''No suspension,'' said Galarraga, who's now been hit a
franchise-record 22 times this season. ''Twenty-two times is too
many to be too nice, too patient, not to hit anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when both Galarraga and Bobby Cox insist Dreifort
intentionally threw at the first baseman _ both last Sunday in Los
Angeles and Saturday at the Ted.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the only time I think was intentional all year,'' Cox
said of Dreifort. ''This guy, twice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Why don't they hit me when I strike out four times?'' said
Galarraga. ''They only throw at me when I hit a home run...It's
right there. No question they're throwing the ball at me.''
</P>
<P>
   No question the Braves would've responded in kind, too, had
Dreifort not been wrestled to the ground by Galarraga. The pitcher
left the game with an abrasion on the right elbow. It could've been
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to have hit the pitcher and Dreifort didn't come
back out (to hit),'' Cox said. ''We were gonna stick him one pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga will appeal if Coleman suspends him, as the first
baseman unsuccessfully did last year. This time, he said, is
different. ''I've been hit 22 times, I don't fight anybody,''
Galarraga said. Besides, ''I don't understand them suspending the
hitter. I think the pitcher (is worse). The pitcher's starting
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the Dodgers' insistence that Galarraga crowds the
plate before stepping into the pitch and Dreifort was merely
pitching him inside, ''I'm not diving into the ball,'' he said.
''There's no question they're throwing at me intentionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox may speak to Coleman and ''Tell him what happened before.
When he watches the tapes, he'll see what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never had a problem here (with hitting batters and then
retaliation),'' said the manager. ''This is different. This guy
will be dealt with. You hit the nicest guy in baseball. He's
picking on the wrong guy. He's (Galarraga) got too many supporters
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cather's rib
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cather, sent down to Class AAA Richmond July 16, is back in
Atlanta _ for medical reasons. The reliever is scheduled to have
his first right rib surgically removed this week to correct a
circulatory problem that caused pain in his pitching arm, then
tightness that temporarily prevented him from gripping a ball
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Cather, who's already undergone nerve and blood tests here
peformed by Braves orthopedist Joe Chandler, will have further
tests and then likely surgery by Dr. Joe Miller, a thoracic
vascular surgeon at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should be fine by spring training,'' said Chandler, who
said ex-Brave farmhand John LeRoy and John Hudek both had surgery
for similar conditions in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler described Cather's condition as, ''After he pitches, he
gets aching pain down his arm and tightness so he can't grip
anything. After 30 minutes, it goes away.'' The problem, which has
affected Cather for about a month and bothered him once last year
in the post-season, occurs during the pitching motion.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he throws, he gets temporary suspension of his
sub-clavian artery,'' said Chandler. The first rib is likely
depressing the artery, restricting the blood flow and causing pain
and tightness. Chandler said tests have shown no nerve damage or
blood clots. If further tests confirm the rib is responsible,
surgery is likely this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cather was 2-2 with a 3.92 ERA in 36 appearances with Atlanta
before being sent down. In Richmond, he was 0-1, 5.87 in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Hail to El Presidente
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Martinez, who won his 244th career game Aug. 9 in San
Francisco to surpass Juan Marichal as the winningest Latin American
pitcher in baseball history, was honored in a pre-game ceremony.
Surrounded by his family, the 43-year-old Martinez received several
gifts: An action oil portrait of himself from his teammates; a
glass etching from Braves management commerating his career
achievements; and a proclamation declaring Sunday ''Dennis Martinez
Day in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   And one more gift: A videotaped tribute from Marichal shown on
the stadium scoreboard. ''Dennis has always been a great athlete,
very dedicated to his profession,'' said Marichal, the Giants' Hall
of Famer. ''That's why he has been able to break this mark.''
</P>
<P>
   After thanking his family and teammates, Martinez offered his
primary goal with Atlanta: ''To win another World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing and healing
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have signed their top draft pick, pitcher Matt
Belisle of Austin, Tex. The 6-3, 205 right-hander, 18, is
recovering from reconstructive surgery on his left knee after
tearing his ACL in April _ the same injury suffered by Chipper
Jones in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just regular reconstruction and they said it'll come
back 100 per cent,'' said Belisle, who'll be examined by Chandler
today. The surgery was performed by Dr. James Andrews in
Birmingham. Belisle, who said his recovery has been ''ahead of
pace,'' is scheduled to report to the Braves' Instructional League
in Orlando in September, after another examination by Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't do some things _ full-out sprints, go all-out on the
mound yet,'' said Belisle, who's been throwing on the side. ''I'm
taking things slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Belisle, who had a scholarship to the University of Texas, was
actually chosen in the second round as the 52nd pick overall. The
Braves lost their first round selection after signing Galarraga as
a free agent in the off-season. At McCallum High, Belisle was 5-2,
with a 1.69 ERA and had 72 strikeouts in 51 innings. He was ranked
38th among the nation's top prospects by Baseball America.

 &HT;    Weak spots leave Falcons plenty to trim
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves seemed sullen Sunday
afternoon, and he had reasons. There were a few disturbing signs in
Saturday night's 28-22 loss to Pittsburgh, including the play of
right offensive tackle Corey Louchiey, the play of reserve safeties
specifically, and the play of all Falcon reserves in general.
</P>
<P>
   Also, NFL rosters have to be cut to 60 players by 4 p.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves wouldn't say when the 18 (or more) cuts will be made, but
it's possible some will occur today _ when players are off, other
than for film review, stretching and lifting _ and the rest
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Louchiey, whom the team signed to a two-year, $3.5 million
contract in the offseason, was inconsistent, particularly in pass
protection, in his first action after missing two weeks with a
groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Corey played a very poor game,'' Reeves said. ``He
seemed very unsure of himself. I'm not happy with the way he
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Louchiey was not alone in catching his coach's eye. The Falcons
gave up 204 rushing yards, 179 of them in the second half when
reserves took over. Pittsburgh had runs of 62, 47 and 40 runs. Time
after time, safeties were out of position.
</P>
<P>
   Devin Bush was out with a strained knee. Second-year strong
safety Chris Bayne, a college linebacker, saw a lot of action, as
did second-year free safety Marcus Wimberly and rookie free safety
Omar Brown. Rookie free agent strong safety Brad Trout didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   None stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to work on the position of our safeties (against the
run),'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two reserve safeties will be cut. Bayne has
special-teams prowess on his side; Brown, a fourth-round draft
choice, has the fact his waiver could cost the team $234,000 if
another team claimed him.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have more difficult decisions this year than last,
meaning there's more talent. But there are enough weaknesses that
Atlanta will scour the waiver wire the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Louchiey, seventh-rounder Ephraim Salaam was Saturday,
but he was much better the previous two weeks at left tackle.
Likewise, fellow rookie tackle Jose Portilla didn't look good
Saturday on the left side, after being fairly solid the previous
two weeks on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' coaches like their potential, and both ought to
make the team, joining rookie guard-center Bob Hallen, the team's
second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said the Falcons will probably keep 10 offensive linemen.
If Louchiey makes it, he and the other starters make five. Also,
10-year veteran Dave Widell will make the team as a backup
center-guard. He's also the backup deep snapper.
</P>
<P>
   Add the three rookies, and that leaves one spot.
</P>
<P>
   In some years, 14-year veteran Adam Schreiber perhaps would make
the team on deep-snapping ability alone. But Schreiber played right
guard in the fourth quarter Saturday behind Gene Williams and Scott
Adams because, if he's going to make a team that could have three
rookie linemen, a viable backup must be found.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Jeremy Akers, on the practice squad last season, and
undrafted rookie tackle Michael Edwards have barely seen action in
the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, barring a trade or free agent signing, the
10th spot will come down to a decision among Adams, Schreiber and
tackle Nate Miller, who started the first two preseason games in
Louchiey's spot but is out with a nerve problem in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players who have the worst chances of surviving the
cutdown to 60 are those who have seen limited action in the
preseason, either because of injuries or coaches' decision: Rookie
DLs Henry Slay and Ben Huff, DT William Gaines (back/knee), DE
Barry Mitchell (quad/elbow), CBs Randy Fuller (ankle) and Kwame
Ellis, WRs Corey Allen (ankle/knee) and Van Johnson, rookie FB
Darren Fisk and K David Akers.
</P>
<P>
   That's 10 players. Add two safeties, offensive linemen Edwards
and Akers, and either Adams, Miller or Schreiber, and that's 15
(the last offensive lineman may not go until rosters are reduced to
53 Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said ``it's possible'' the team will keep six backs. But
if it's five, like last year, it's down to seventh-rounder Ken
Oxendine, who leads the team with 109 yards on 25 carries, or
eight-year-veteran Harold Green, who's more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Among receivers Todd Kinchen, Keith Crawford, Mercury Hayes and
Kevin Thornal, who was on the practice squad last year, and
undrafted rookie Octavus Barnes, probably just two _ and maybe only
one _ will make the team. Kinchen has been the most impressive;
Barnes has had his moments.
</P>
<P>
   Waiving either Green or Oxendine and two of these receivers
makes 18.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities, excluding surprises, include TEs Ed Smith
and Brian Saxton, CB Lenny McGill, LBs Ben Talley and Ruffin
Hamilton, and rookie QB John Dutton.

COMMENTARY: THE FEAR OF DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It wasn't pretty. Marcia Kramer, the host of a
television interview program on WCBS-TV, wanted to know why
Geraldine Ferraro, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, was
so assiduously avoiding debates with her primary opponents, Charles
Schumer and Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kramer is the reporter who elicited the famous ``did not
inhale'' quote from Bill Clinton. When she gets onto something, she
is relentless.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro is nothing if not thin-skinned. She began her
campaign back in January by saying she wouldn't debate at all
unless her rivals signed a written pledge not to engage in personal
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   That was widely seen as absurd and Ms. Ferraro backed off.
Still, there have been no televised debates so far and only two are
planned. Both are scheduled for the final Sunday of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult for any debate among the three candidates
to be more openly hostile than the encounter that aired Sunday
between Ms. Kramer and Ms. Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kramer was not a disinterested party. She had hoped to land
a debate for her program, ``Sunday Edition.'' That was fine with
Schumer and Green, but Ms. Ferraro declined. So ``Sunday Edition,''
taped on Thursday, had separate interviews with the three
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro's interview was first and it was clear almost
immediately that both the host and the guest were angry. Ms. Kramer
repeatedly accused the candidate of ducking debates and Ms. Ferraro
insisted that she had not.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, an exasperated Ms. Ferraro said: ``Marcia, I'm
surprised at you. I really am surprised.'' She accused Ms. Kramer
of being ``unprofessional.'' And during a commercial break, she
added the caustic comment: ``I was curious which campaign you are
working for.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can decide who came off better in the televised
exchange. But on the issue of debates, Ms. Kramer had a point.
Nearly everyone outside the Ferraro campaign agrees that Ms.
Ferraro is the reason there has been no televised debate so far,
and only two public forums at which all three candidates appeared
together.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Ms. Ferraro has been the cloistered
candidate in this important race, the candidate who behaves as
though she has something to hide. It's as if she were burdened by
the fear that some terrible misfortune would occur if she stepped
before the television cameras and joined in the rough and tumble of
a genuine public debate with Schumer and Green.
</P>
<P>
   As she is the front-runner and the best-known candidate, Ms.
Ferraro may be be right. She might come off poorly by comparison.
She could make a devastating gaffe. From a purely political
perspective, she may be doing the right thing. But for voters
looking for the best alternative to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a
candidate-in-hiding can only be a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro adamantly insists that she is not hiding. Her
campaign spokesman, Stephen Gaskill, said: ``She's done 50 public
events in July and 43 thus far in August. That's hardly hiding from
the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Ms. Ferraro said she believes an
incorrect impression is being created by press coverage that is
more favorable to her opponents. When asked why the press would be
fairer to Schumer or Green, she replied, ``Probably because I'm the
front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and Green have been chasing Ms. Ferraro since she
announced her candidacy in January. Schumer, and especially Green,
who has raised relatively little money, have been anxious to
debate. Invitations have poured in from around the state. But Ms.
Ferraro's response, with very few exceptions, has been simple and
unambiguous _ no.
</P>
<P>
   The polls have consistently shown Ms. Ferraro to be well ahead,
although there have been indications recently that her lead is
weakening. Her strategy, however, is not changing.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and Green have both said they would be willing to
participate in additional debates between now and the final Sunday
before the election. Ms. Ferraro said she would have no part of
that. ``No,'' she said. ``I won't be bullied into this, and that's
what I think the press is doing.'' (BOX)

JETS' JOHNSON BELIEVES HE HAS MASTERED END GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ ``You know I'm slow, right?'' Keyshawn Johnson
asked, then chuckled before getting into his Ferrari on Sunday.
``I'm so slow, no one's getting me the ball. Can't outrun
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   So he sped off, for emphasis, laughing all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson likes to think of himself as the Jets' most important
receiver. He always has, and he still does. And despite the Jets'
acquisition of the redoubtable Curtis Martin at running back,
quarterback Glenn Foley says he will be looking for Johnson when he
throws the ball downfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson who has shown up during the Jets' exhibition season
is quite different from the player they made the league's overall
No. 1 draft pick in 1996. This is a more svelte, yet more powerful,
player _ and someone who understands the position of wide receiver
better. His routes have become disciplined. Imagine a 6-foot-3-inch
210-pounder who knows where he is going, while the smaller and
lighter cornerbacks do not.
</P>
<P>
   That growth translated into a sterling game against the Giants
last Thursday: 6 catches for 99 yards. On two of the catches, he
embarrassed the Giants' defenders, catching one ball 6 yards away
from cornerback Phillippi Sparks, and another so far in the clear
it was difficult to tell which Giants were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to published quotes from some Giants defenders that he
had boasted during the game of being a gang member, Johnson said:
``Maybe it was because we got 400 yards of offense against them
that they were complaining. Maybe their great players were upset.
Maybe they said things to me, too, but you didn't hear me moaning
about things they said. Maybe they spoke to me first.''
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson said Sunday that he was not a gang member.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition season, which ends Friday night at Chicago, will
lead Johnson into a more important, if symbolic, gauge of where he
is. Johnson and the Jets open the regular season at San Francisco.
And that means facing Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been playing videotapes of Rice and other great
receivers for months, since the Jets' last regular-season game
against Detroit, when they missed the playoffs as Johnson failed to
hold on to a pair of passes in the clutch.

   ``After that game I said to myself, `I'll never let that happen
to me again,''' Johnson said. ``I can be a special player in this
league. This is only my second year in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he really knows that this is going to be his third season.
But he explains: ``In my rookie year, I was in the minor leagues.
Now I'm in the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   His rookie season was the 1-15 debacle that, in a sense, helped
turn the franchise around. For it was then that the owner, Leon
Hess, decided enough was enough, and hired Bill Parcells as the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells repeated Sunday that the outspoken and often
controversial Johnson gives him no trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to do well,'' Parcells said. ``Think he's hard? He's
one of the easiest guys I've got. The more he knows, the more he
knows what he doesn't know.''
</P>

<P>
   Johnson said Sunday that what he did not know had to do with
routes. As a rookie, as he had through his college career, Johnson
was able to outmuscle the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to be a better receiver,'' he said. ``I already was a
good football player.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes showed him how to come back to the ball, for instance,
or ``not making every route look the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson even does some coaching himself these days. He put on a
headset against the Giants in the fourth period, when he was long
out of the game, to communicate with the offensive coordinator,
Charlie Weis. Johnson also makes suggestions on altering the
alignments so he can take advantage of defenders.
</P>
<P>
   He also spent hours in the off season working on a big problem:
keeping his feet inbounds on sideline catches. He hired a personal
trainer who drilled him on footwork and threw ball after ball to
him as Johnson ran toward the sideline. He had to reach for the
ball while keeping his feet inbounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm becoming a receiver rather than a baller,'' said Johnson,
who has caught 133 passes and has 13 touchdowns in his two seasons.
``A baller is a guy who's got enough athletic ability to get to the
ball. But now I'm a receiver.''

<P>
   As automobile accidents go, it was not much: Two teen-agers
driving home from school in Southern California were bumped from
behind. They later told investigators that they felt a little pain
in their backs and necks.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the crash they went first not to a doctor but to a
lawyer. The lawyer sent them to a clinic and the bills started to
mount up. After two months the bills for one boy, 19, came to
$3,740. For his friend, 14, the cost was $4,090.
</P>
<P>
   As Allstate, the insurance company that covered the boys'
accident, sees it, the bills _ including one for $250 for an
initial exam that the boys said took a few minutes _ were grossly
inflated.
</P>
<P>
   The case is but one that Allstate plans to cite on Monday, when
it intends to notify about a dozen Southern California doctors and
chiropractors and their assistants that they are being sued for $25
million for repeatedly overbilling or billing for services they
never provided, in hundreds of cases over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Cases like the one involving the two teenagers, insurance
industry executives say, are part of a widespread pattern of fraud
across the United States. The Insurance Research Council, an
industry organization in Illinois, says that nearly 40 percent of
the claims for auto accident injuries now involve fraud. And a
fortune is at stake. Last year alone, insurers received claims for
more than $42 billion for auto-accident injuries.
</P>
<P>
   While insurance fraud is a problem as old as insurance itself,
industry experts see a disturbing variation on the theme: Rather
than premeditated criminal activity involving supposed accident
victims, insurers say some doctors and clinics are capitalizing on
real accidents and real injuries by seeking reimbursement for
procedures not required and never performed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Insurance Research Council says 90 percent of the
offenses are not planned but are ``opportunistic fraud'' in which
professionals, and sometimes patients, seize a chance to profit
with little apparent likelihood of being caught.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Allstate, the country's second-largest auto insurer, is
starting to go after doctors and clinics across the country where
they are finding evidence of such overbilling.
</P>
<P>
   The California suits, which were filed under seal two months ago
as required by that state's law and will be served to the parties
Monday, are the first of their kind by a major auto insurer. But
they are not the last. Edward Moran, the chief of investigations
for Allstate, said the company was developing cases against other
doctors and clinics in San Francisco; Chicago; Memphis, Tenn.;
Miami; Philadelphia and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want doctors to know there is a price to pay for committing
insurance fraud,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees about the magnitude of the problem. Leaders
of the American Medical Association and the Association of Trial
Lawyers of America, the leading organization of personal injury
lawyers, say they believe the insurance industry is vastly
overstating the extent of the fraud. They say they suspect that
charges of fraud are a cynical tactic by insurers to limit the
reimbursements they pay out.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is not simply a figment of the insurance
industry's imagination. In recent years there have been some
stunning cases of respected hospital and health maintenance
organization officials being charged by government investors with
overbilling for Medicare and Medicaid services.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, however, auto insurers have not systematically
attacked the problem. In the past, they tried to deny suspicious
claims _ which they continue to do _ or tried to discount them when
they were negotiating settlements. But the problem has only grown
worse, the insurers say.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suits are an extension of earlier efforts by
Allstate, by State Farm, the largest auto insurer, and by some of
their competitors to file civil suits and help build criminal cases
against gangs around the country that make a business of staging
fake accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, organizers, known as cappers, recruit people to
drive into the paths of unsuspecting motorists and cause crashes.
Then, often working through corrupt lawyers and doctors, the
recruits, often three or four in a single car, begin building up
fake medical bills for submission to insurers.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Allstate sued 45 doctors, lawyers, and
fake-accident organizers in Los Angeles for $107 million in the
largest suit ever filed in connection with fake auto accidents.
State Farm has filed several suits against fake-accident rings and
is at work on several more.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suits in Southern California are different. The
accidents, as far as the insurers know, were real. And, also as far
as they can tell, all the fraud took place in clinics where, to
increase their earnings, all the doctors and chiropractors had to
do was indicate on insurance forms that they had performed costly
procedures when, in fact, they had done little or no work.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say that in some of the overbilling, patients are
silent partners in fraud with their doctors, often encouraged by
personal injury lawyers. The practice of settling auto insurance
claims, the insurers say, is generally to pay two or three times
the amount of medical bills for pain and suffering. So the more
doctors charge, the more a patient and his lawyer are likely to
get.
</P>
<P>
   For example, with medical bills of $2,000 an insurer might pay a
settlement of $6,000; with bills of $4,000, the settlement can
often be $12,000. (The incentive for fraudulently building up
claims like this is reduced or eliminated by some no-fault plans
that provide payment for pain and suffering only for catastrophic
injuries.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many patients may be unaware that their treatment is being
padded. They often pay little attention to their bills, seldom
bothering to check billing codes, descriptions of treatments and
costs, even if they are decipherable, because they know the
insurance company is paying. And often, when lawyers are involved,
doctors' bills go not to the patient but to the lawyer for
forwarding to the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the nature of the treatment for some of the most
common auto accident injuries, whiplash and other strains and
sprains, is not altogether unpleasant. So it may be difficult for a
patient to protest if he is offered 25 sessions of massage,
ultra-sound and alternating hot and cold packs, when a dozen might
suffice. To further complicate matters, professionals may truly
differ on how many such therapy sessions are enough.
</P>
<P>
   In its suits against doctors, Allstate says it is not trying to
dictate treatment. ``We're not challenging doctors' individual
decisions,'' Moran said. ``We're challenging a pattern of billing
at the highest possible level in order to inflate claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randolph Smoak, chairman of the AMA's board of trustees,
said that while insurers may challenge a doctor's choice of billing
codes, he believes there is little deliberate abuse. Rather than
taking doctors to court, as Allstate is doing, he said, the first
step should be a discussion to resolve billing differences.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Kass, an insurance fraud specialist in the Los Angeles
law firm of Manning, Marder &AMP; Wolfe working for Allstate, said the
insurer was not moving against doctors suspected of overbilling in
a few instances, but against ``personal injury mills treating
hundreds and hundreds of people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Allstate had not tried to negotiate with the doctors it
was suing or advised them of the legal action out of concern that
incriminating evidence might be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and lawyers feel besieged. ``What the insurance
companies are doing is attacking the only source of help these
injured people have, the doctors who treat them and the lawyers who
represent them,'' said Mark Mandell, the president of the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America.
</P>
<P>
   In the cases now being developed by Allstate, the insurer is not
trying to prosecute those involved in the accidents, Kass said.
Trying to establish whether patients were aware of fraud is
difficult, he said. But the doctors, he said, lay down a trail of
evidence by submitting falsified bills.

YELTSIN DISMISSES ECONOMIC REFORMERS, REINSTATES CHERNOMYRDIN 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ On Sunday, President Boris Yeltsin, in an anxious bid
to shore up his political support, dismissed his new team of
economic reformers and reinstated Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's surprise decision came just five months after he
derided Chernomyrdin as a spent force and cast him out of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt action raised fresh doubts about the Kremlin's
commitment to tough economic reforms and posed unsettling questions
about Yeltsin's ability to govern.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has hired and dismissed top aides so often that
government shake-ups have become a common feature of Russia's
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But his decision to substitute the stolid Chernomyrdin for the
reform-minded Sergei Kiriyenko was a stunning one _ even for the
mercurial president.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin offered no public explanation Sunday night for his
decision to dismiss Kiriyenko and the entire Cabinet and name
Chernomyrdin acting prime minister. The move was disclosed in a
terse statement on the evening television news, just after the
reports on the day's sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   To many commentators, it appeared that the president had decided
that his political survival was more important than plowing ahead
with an aggressive program of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   While the 60-year-old Chernomyrdin is seen by most of the
Russian public as uninspiring, he is a consensus figure for much of
the power elite.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial oligarchy sees Chernomyrdin as a far more
sympathetic and pliable leader than the brainy Kiriyenko. The
Russian press has featured reports that Boris Berezovsky, the
tycoon and media mogul, was plotting to restore Chernomyrdin to
power.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also appears to be calculating that the appointment of
Chernomyrdin will deflate the repeated calls in the
Communist-dominated parliament for his resignation. As the former
head of the Soviet gas industry, Chernomyrdin has also maintained
good relations with the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The same factors that make Chernomyrdin an acceptable leader for
financiers and Communists, however, make him a questionable choice
to extract Russia from its economic quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   In his first five years as prime minister, Chernomyrdin presided
over Russia's unsteady march toward capitalism. But he also
tolerated much of the cronyism and many of the half-measures that
have helped bring Russia to its current impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin acknowledged as much in March when told the nation that
he was dismissing Chernomyrdin because a new, young team was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question is whether the return of a longtime
politician like Chernomyrdin would restore a sense of political
stability or whether it would stoke feelings that Yeltsin was
grasping at straws in his efforts to cope with the escalating
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian banks on the brink of insolvency and the ruble in
decline, Russia faces a number of crucial policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It must decide on a way to restructure its short-term debt. It
must determine how many politically connected banks it can afford
to bail out. It must also find a way to reassure anxious foreign
investors, who have been fleeing in droves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin sought Sunday night to reassure the Clinton
administration that the shake-up was not a economic retreat.
Chernomyrdin and Kiriyenko spoke separately Sunday night by
telephone with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said the Russian officials ``put a strong
emphasis on continuing the march.'' But he acknowledged that
neither official provided any specifics or explained the reason for
Yeltsin's move.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian politicians, however, were far less charitable.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Lukin, a leading member of the opposition Yabloko
Party, said Yeltsin's decision was evidence of ``profound confusion
and uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, the suddenness of Sunday night's move added a
further element of instability. The last time Yeltsin dismissed his
Cabinet, he ended up reappointing most of his top aides to
government posts. But Sunday night's statement did not make clear
which Kremlin officials would be reappointed and which would be
sacked.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Boris Fyodorov, a top Kremlin aide and the nation's
senior tax collector, remained unclear. Fyodorov's appointment was
hailed by Western officials in the hope that Russia might finally
be cracking down on tax delinquents and putting an end to insider
deals.
</P>
<P>
   But Fyodorov does not have the best of relations with
Chernomyrdin. He mocked Chernomyrdin as a do-nothing official
during Chernomyrdin's first term as prime minister. Western
investors said they had been assured that Fyodorov would keep his
job for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is a matter of hours, days or weeks is not clear,''
a leading investment banker said.
</P>
<P>
   As a technical matter, Chernomyrdin was named acting prime
minister and will have to be confirmed by parliament for his
appointment to become permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Russian constitution, Yeltsin has two weeks to
nominate a permanent prime minister. If the parliament rejects
Yeltsin's choice three times, the president has the right to
dissolve the legislature and call for new parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin is unlikely to face the bruising confirmation
battle that Kiriyenko endured this spring. Gennadi Zyuganov, the
Communist leader, was temperate in his criticism of Yeltsin's
shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an upside down decision,'' Zyuganov said. ``The
president had another option: first hold consultations with members
of the parliament, determine priorities in this issue and then
act.''
</P>
<P>
   With presidential elections scheduled for the year 2000, the
Communist opposition is likely to use the shake-up as an
opportunity to discredit the Yeltsin government and to lobby for a
power-sharing arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Chernomyrdin wins easy confirmation, there was a
surrealistic quality about his selection Sunday. For weeks this
spring, the nation's business was brought to halt as Yeltsin argued
that the government needed new people and new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Yeltsin has come full circle, forfeiting much of his
credibility in the process. Nikolai Ryzhkov, the leader of a
left-wing faction in the parliament, said that the president's move
was completely illogical.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers, for their part, sought to put the best
face on Sunday's events. But extracting promises from Yeltsin that
the economic reform will continue will be a pressing task when
President Clinton arrives in Moscow next week for a summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko, for his part, seemed resigned to his fate. Just five
months ago, the 36-year-old former energy minister and banker was
plucked from relative obscurity and hailed by Yeltsin as Russia's
best hope to usher in a new era of reform. In his brief tenure, he
lobbied hard for politically unpopular reforms and, like other
reformers before him, emerged as the scapegoat for all of Russia's
economic ills.
</P>
<P>
   After he learned of Yeltsin's decision, Kiriyenko called Gore to
say goodbye and to try to reassure the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sunday evening, he and Boris Nemtsov, another pro-reform
member of the dismissed government, strolled out of their offices
in the White House, the Yeltsin government's headquarters, to talk
with striking coal miners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing concrete was discussed,'' one miner later told the
press. ``They just came down to talk, for a regular chat.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Throughout the 1980s, the Soviet Union threw almost
every weapon it had, short of nuclear bombs, at the Afghan camps
attacked by the United States last week.
</P>
<P>
   During their nine-year occupation of Afghanistan, the Soviets
attacked the camps outside the town of Khost with Scud missiles,
500-pound bombs dropped from jets, barrages of artillery, flights
of helicopter gunships and their crack special forces. The toughest
Soviet commander in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, personally
led the last assault.
</P>
<P>
   But neither carpet bombing nor commandos drove the Afghan holy
warriors from the mountains. Afghanistan has a long history of
repelling superpowers. Its terrain favors defenders as well as any
in the world, whether their opponents, like the Soviets, are trying
to defeat them on the ground or whether, like the United States,
they are trying to disperse, deter and disrupt them. It is
uncertain that the United States, which fired dozens of
million-dollar cruise missiles at those same camps on Thursday, can
do better than the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   The camps, hidden in the steep mountains and mile-deep valleys
of Paktia province, were the place where all seven ranking Afghan
resistance leaders maintained underground headquarters, mountain
redoubts and clandestine weapons stocks during their bitter and
ultimately successful war against Soviet troops from December 1979
to February 1989, according to American intelligence veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan resistance was backed by the intelligence services of
the United States and Saudi Arabia with nearly $6 billion worth of
weapons. And the territory targeted last week, a set of six
encampments around Khost, where the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden has
financed a kind of ``terrorist university,'' in the words of a
senior U.S. intelligence official, is well known to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's military and financial support for the Afghan rebels
indirectly helped build the camps that the United States attacked.
And some of the same warriors who fought the Soviets with the CIA's
help are now fighting under bin Laden's banner.
</P>
<P>
   From those same camps, the Afghan rebels, known as mujahedeen,
or holy warriors, kept up a decadelong siege on the
Soviet-supported garrison town of Khost.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of mujahedeen were dug into the mountains around
Khost. Soviet accounts of the siege of Khost during 1988 referred
to the rebel camps as ``the last word in NATO engineering
techniques.'' After a decade of fighting during which each side
claimed to have killed thousands of the enemy, the Afghan rebels
poured out of their encampments and took Khost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most fiercely contested piece of real estate in
the 10-year Afghan war,'' said Milt Bearden, who ran the CIA's side
of the war from 1986 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said their attack was intended to deter bin
Laden, whom they call the financier and intellectual author of this
month's bombings of two American embassies in Africa, which killed
263 people, including 12 Americans. They said the damage inflicted
on the Khost camps was ``moderate to heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the communications infrastructure used by bin Laden is based
on portable satellite telephones, not a centralized
command-and-control system that can be destroyed with a missile,
intelligence officials said. The strongest power that binds his
loose-knit network of confederates is his money, which is hidden
inside a thus-far impenetrable global maze.
</P>
<P>
   And history does not favor superpowers trying to subdue men dug
into the mountains of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has said he spent the 1980s backing the mujahedeen
from their political base in Peshawar, Pakistan, near the foot of
the Khyber Pass. He was most strongly allied with the most
fundamentalist leaders of the Afghan resistance, particularly
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, head of the group called the Islamic Party.
After the fall of the Soviet-backed government, Hekmatyar spent
most of his brief tenure as prime minister of Afghanistan hurling
missiles and mortars at Kabul, trying to dislodge more moderate
rebel leaders from power.
</P>
<P>
   The more militant Afghan rebels, like Hekmatyar, denounced the
United States and backed Iraq during the Persian Gulf war in 1991,
as did bin Laden. A year after the Persian Gulf war, posters
throughout eastern Afghanistan displayed heroic, if imaginary,
portraits of Saddam Hussein and Hekmatyar standing side by side.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of money or moral support could keep the veterans of
the Afghan resistance from killing one another after the fall of
Kabul. The chaos that their infighting created led to the rise of
the Taliban, the militant armed religious party that now controls
most of Afghanistan and harbors bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine years since the Soviet withdrawal, Afghan resistance
veterans have hoarded the remaining weapons sent by the CIA and set
up military training centers at resistance camps like the one near
Khost, according to U.S. officials. In those years, thousands of
Islamic outcasts, radicals and visionaries from around the world
came to the borderlands of Afghanistan to learn the lessons of war
from the mujahedeen. Bin Laden sponsored many of those foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 interview, a commander loyal to Hekmatyar, Noor Amin,
said that ``the whole country is a university for jihad,'' or holy
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many formal training centers,'' Amin said. ``We have
had Egyptians, Sudanese, Arabs and other foreigners trained here as
assassins.'' U.S. officials said the former mujahedeen camps it
attacked on Thursday were precisely that kind of ``university for
jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, stripped of his Saudi citizenship and stateless,
returned to the anarchy of Afghanistan in 1996 from the Sudan,
where U.S. intelligence analysts believe he built at least three
training camps for veterans of the Afghan war.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview with CNN last year that one of his main
missions during the war, which he helped finance with millions of
dollars of his own money, was to transport bulldozers, front-end
loaders and other heavy equipment to Pakistan to help build
tunnels, military depots and roads inside Afghanistan for the
mujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether bin Laden, who inherited about $250
million from a fortune his father made building mosques, palaces
and public works for the Saudi royal family, personally helped
build the Khost camps during the war against the Soviets, or has
substantially upgraded them since returning to the mountains of
Afghanistan.

HILLIARD GIVING GIANTS A REASON TO SMILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jason Sehorn's injury last week was a lightning
strike to the heart of the team. But just as one young star was
being carted from the stage, another was fortuitously stepping into
the void.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Ike Hilliard was the player whose absence devastated
the Giants. Thursday, it was not lost on some Giants that it was
Hilliard who brought the Giants back to life after the depression
of the opening kickoff, when Sehorn's knee ligaments were torn.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the first half, Hilliard made it evident why he is
special _ for what he sees and what he makes others see.
</P>
<P>
   The first moment came early, a simple but significant adjustment
Hilliard made at the line of scrimmage. On a third down, the Jets
seemed poised to blitz one of their safeties, and with the kind of
nonverbal communication so essential between quarterback and
receiver, both Hilliard and Giants quarterback Danny Kanell knew
what they had to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard had to break off his intended pattern and slant across
the middle. Kanell had to hold the ball long enough for Hilliard to
get across the field, even though it would mean taking a hit an
instant after releasing the football.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard found the gap in the defense; Kanell released the ball
and went down in a heap. Hilliard shielded the football from the
defender, Ray Mickens, who was arriving a bit late. A 12-yard gain
led to a field goal four plays later.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a guy like Ike,'' Kanell said later, ``I can throw the
football to a spot, and you know he's going to get to that spot
first. A risky play becomes a dependable play. A play like that
picks everybody up. We all saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard's second defining moment came immediately afterward.
What the rest of the team saw next, as Kanell said, was infectious
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the Ike Hilliard I know come to the sidelines,'' Giants
Coach Jim Fassel said. ``He came over with his eyes wide and with a
smile you could see from across the field. He's a spark. I've often
thought he could be the personality on offense for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard had seven receptions for 74 yards in Thursday's game.
He also drew a pass interference penalty near the goal line in the
first quarter when Aaron Glenn, the Jets' top cornerback, knocked
him down trying to keep him from catching a pass along the right
sideline. That penalty set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Tiki
Barber.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively for the Giants, the first quarter was Hilliard's
time to shine. On the team's first possession, Hilliard caught
three passes from Kanell. The first of those was another
quick-hitting pattern over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ike caught the pass and split four guys coming in on him,''
Fassel said. ``He grabbed it and advanced it up the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsaid in that brief evaluation was that Hilliard withstood a
jarring, direct hit from two Jets in what is a very crowded and
potentially dangerous part of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard injured his neck catching a downfield pass over the
middle 11 months ago. He had season-ending surgery, and for months,
Hilliard has weathered the questions about how he would hold up to
contact again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was getting tired of talking about it,'' Fassel
said.
</P>
<P>
   That line of questioning should lessen now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Hilliard said after Thursday's game when that
sentiment was related to him. ``I will appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilliard, 22, is a playful man of few words. He is popular with
his teammates, and his presence has lifted the offense. With
Hilliard at flanker, game-breaking plays seem possible again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just playing football,'' Hilliard said. ``But sure, it
feels good to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Flashing a smile, Hilliard added: ``But hey, I told you all
along that I'd be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it's good news that the Giants sorely need.
Hilliard's return on Thursday came not a minute too soon.

RECORD 755 HOMERS MIGHT BE OUT OF REACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The greatest sluggers in baseball are focused on
Roger Maris at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Off in the distance, barely visible, is a lithe, yet powerful
figure with a record even more profound than Maris' single-season
home run mark of 61. And while not even Mark McGwire can dream of
that record, one day someone will have his sights set on this man,
and the nation will be riveted as it was a quarter century ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Henry Aaron did the impossible: He caught and then
passed Babe Ruth to become the most prolific home run hitter in
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's 755 home runs, the last of which was hit in 1976, is
perhaps American sports' greatest statistical monument and a record
that some believe will never be broken given the evolution of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The math is simple.
</P>
<P>
   If 28-year-old Ken Griffey Jr. averages roughly 35 home runs
over the next 12 years, he'll catch Aaron. Juan Gonzalez, also 28,
would have to average closer to 40 over the same period, and
McGwire, 34, would need an average of about 55 over six years.
Sounds plausible, right? Well, plausible and realistic are entirely
different.
</P>
<P>
   Stats, Inc.'s ``Baseball Scoreboard'' gave Griffey (336 homers)
only a 27 percent chance of catching Aaron after last season,
although that figure could exceed 30 percent after this year.
McGwire (434) was given a 15 percent chance, Gonzalez (289) 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's one of the hardest records to break,'' said Don
Zminda, vice president of publications for Stats. ``So many things
have to go right. I mean, so few great players in history have not
missed a significant amount of time because of injury or had one or
two bad years that threw them off track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just never happened to Aaron.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, now 64 and an executive with the Atlanta Braves, was a
star from the start, but no one would've imagined early in his
career that he might challenge Ruth. As former teammate and
broadcaster Ernie Johnson said, ``He was a skinny line-drive
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he wasn't particularly large during his playing days:
6-foot, 180 pounds. He didn't hit tape-measure home runs. Heck, he
never even hit 50 in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Aaron would have been given only a 5 percent chance
of reaching 756 homers at Griffey's age, according to Stats'
formula, which was devised by Bill James and is based on how far
the player is from a particular goal, how quickly he's getting
there and how much time he has left.
</P>
<P>
   How'd Aaron get to 755? He averaged 38.3 his next 12 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistency, that was the name of the game,'' said Aaron, who
doesn't dwell on the record and seems almost uncomfortable talking
about it. ``I think I'm most proud of that aspect, the consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``And how did I do it? Staying focused on what I had to do. Once
a player loses that, no matter how much ability he has, he won't be
able to accomplish anything at this level. It's why players seem to
have some good years and some bad years, because they read
yesterday's news instead of focusing on today.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron and several others suggested that the times helped him
keep that focus. In his day, Aaron and his peers didn't make
millions of dollars or enjoy the security of multiyear contracts. A
bad year could result in a pay cut they couldn't afford, the
prospect of which kept their minds in the game.
</P>
<P>
   There are players today like Paul Molitor, the 41-year-old
designated hitter for the Minnesota Twins who appears to be as
motivated by his place in baseball history as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, several baseball people have asked the same
question: How many active players will have the incentive to play
the years _ Aaron played 23 _ necessary to challenge the sport's
career records?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past generations of ballplayers, today's stars can decide
they no longer want to spend time away from their families without
even considering the financial implications. In other words,
whether a player challenges Aaron's record might come down to will.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really true,'' Zminda said. ``It probably helped Aaron
that he was underpaid compared to now. It encouraged him to keep
playing. Griffey might decide at 35 or so that he has enough money
and not play any more.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until his mid-30s that Aaron's name was first linked
to Ruth's.
</P>
<P>
   When players typically begin a serious decline in production,
Aaron continued to find the fences. After he turned 36, he hit 201
homers _ 159 between 36 and 39, an average of 40 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he remained in good condition, those unusually strong
wrists never failed him, he had the advantage of playing in
homer-friendly Atlanta (although he played his first 12 seasons in
cavernous Milwaukee) and he avoided injuries. Again, however, he
said it came down to focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like drafting a pure quarterback or trying to
make a quarterback. Which do you want?'' Aaron said. ``I was a pure
hitter, I could always hit. That was a big part of it....
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more than ability, though. It comes back to focus. You
have to be able to throw out what you did yesterday and do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Griffey has the right makeup to challenge Aaron.
One, he seems to love the game, which could give him the longevity
he would need. And, two, as his boss, Seattle Mariners manager Lou
Piniella, has said, he has that even temperament and unwavering
confidence that lends itself to consistency.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Aaron was. It's impossible to tell from his demeanor
whether he went 4 for 4 or 0 for 4 on a given day, said former
teammate Johnson, who described Aaron as perpetually ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   His temperament certainly showed as he approached Ruth. When it
became clear that he had a shot at the record, Aaron received
thousands of hate-filled, racist letters and many death threats
from those who couldn't accept the fact an African-American was
about to eclipse the great _ and white _ Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it affected Aaron. However, for the main part, the
anger and fear for his family boiled inside him; he didn't show it
much on the outside, according to those around him. And he
certainly didn't let it affect his play. In the face of it all, the
homers kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever challenges Aaron's record one day likely will have to
play in a good hitter's park, he'll have to avoid injuries, he'll
have to remain motivated and he'll have to keep that focus. But he
!ital!won't!off! have to live the nightmare Aaron lived.
</P>
<P>
   Even now he dismisses it, saying, ``It didn't make me feel one
way or the other. There are just a lot of angry people in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of person who will hit 756 home runs: strong
inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of me just going out and performing,'' he
said, trying to explain how he managed to remain productive while
shrouded in a fog of bigotry. ``All the time people were writing
those letters and all that stuff, it was instilled in my brain that
I was a baseball player. I was always in control of my temper. I
had to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a lot of things in my career. I had a son who
died at only 3 days old. I went through a divorce later in my
career. And at the height of the Babe Ruth chase, I was able to do
what I had to do. It was my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Maris had some problems. People just have different
makeups. Why is Michael Jordan the way he is? He's not that much
better than a lot of other players. He just stays focused because
he knows what he wants. It was the same with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' Gary Sheffield says a player has a better chance to
catch Aaron if he's not playing for a contender. ``On a good team,
you're always playing in close games with the game on the line,''
he explained. ``On a bad team, the opposing pitcher knows even if
you homer, it's only one run. The year I hit 42 (1996), we weren't
very good. After my first 15 homers, I had 18 RBIs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many knowledgeable people believe Aaron's record will stand
forever. Frank Robinson, No. 4 on the all-time list with 586
homers, went so far as to tell the Washington Post recently, ``I
don't see anyone coming close to Aaron.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who disagree? Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Said the home run king: ``Anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He should know.

TORN BETWEEN LAWYERS AND AIDES, CLINTON CHOSE STRATEGY OF DENIAL

 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 21, the morning the accusations about
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky first
appeared in the news media, the political consultant Dick Morris
was in New York City when his pager went off. The call, Morris said
in an interview, was from the president.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, there had been heated deliberations between
lawyers in the office of the White House counsel, Charles Ruff, and
the White House communications and political team, according to
several current and former White House aides interviewed in the
past week.
</P>
<P>
   A White House adviser said the lawyers wanted the president to
say very little and insisted that the word ``sexual'' not appear in
Clinton's first official statement about Ms. Lewinsky, which was
due to be released by Mike McCurry, the White House press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Several political and communications advisers, who had weathered
previous accusations involving Clinton, were pressing for as much
early candor as possible, the ``more rather than less approach,''
as one of them labeled it in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently torn himself over the best approach, the president
reached out once again to Morris, the political consultant who had
helped orchestrate his comeback from the brink of other disasters,
including the 1994 election that delivered the House to the
Republicans. Morris, whose position as a Clinton insider had been
shattered by his own sexual misconduct in 1996, said he was not
surprised to get the call.
</P>
<P>
   The president told Morris that he had ``slipped up'' with Ms.
Lewinsky but that the charges against him were untrue, Morris said.
The adviser offered to take a poll to see what the attitude of the
voters would be if the president admitted an affair with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before the poll results were back, Clinton proceeded shakily
through a first day of questions, with a vague statement (the
president ``never had any improper relationship'' with Ms.
Lewinsky), and an oddly present-tense response in a PBS interview
(``There is no sexual relationship _ that is accurate.''). In the
following days, backed in part, Morris said, by his polling, the
denials only became more forceful.
</P>
<P>
   All last week, in the wake of the president's belated admission
that he ``did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not
appropriate,'' there has been a barrage of second-guessing about
decisions that were made last January. Should the president have
been more truthful, earlier? Why did he mislead the public for
seven months? Why was he not more apologetic? Why did he use
lawyerly phrases such as ``legally accurate''?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to many of these questions rest in the tension
between the president's political and legal interests and, of
course, inside himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matrix of political and legal considerations in these
cases is beguiling. You can't ever get it just right,'' said
Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who has defended many political
figures and who attended a White House meeting of Democratic
operatives on Wednesday. ``The adversary function of a legal case
rests on saying nothing and making people prove a case. The
political system functions by running at the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   After the PBS interview, with Jim Lehrer, some members of the
political team reacted with horror. One White House adviser said
that Clinton sounded like a zombie programmed by lawyers. Harry
Thomason, the Hollywood producer who had helped orchestrate some of
Clinton's most successful political moments, including his
acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic convention, was so worried
that he called Hillary Rodham Clinton, who encouraged him to come
to Washington, reported an account in The New Yorker. He arrived
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Morris said, he had reported his polling results back
to the president. The public would forgive admission of a sexual
dalliance, but not that the president had been untruthful about it
in his sworn deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones case, which has since been dismissed, was one of two
highly worrisome legal matters closing in on the president back in
January. The other was the continuing investigation by the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Anything the president said
could have serious ramifications on both. The lawyers were also
concerned that if the president provided different versions of the
story, he would be vulnerable to a perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   But the political situation seemed equally precarious. As there
were last week, there were predictions in the early days that the
president would be forced to resign or face impeachment. The
political advisers wanted the president to communicate effectively
with the public.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle, there was a president who, according to his
speech last Monday, was motivated ``by a desire to protect myself
from the embarrassment of my own conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Lehrer interview on Jan. 21, there was a vocal
clash between the political and communications team and the lawyers
in a confrontation that one participant recalls ``bordered on
getting violent.'' A group of aides then confronted Clinton's lead
outside lawyer, David Kendall of Williams &AMP; Connolly, to complain
about the lack of information coming from the lawyers. According to
one aide, Kendall, who did not return a call to comment for this
article, responded sharply to criticisms that he was not
sufficiently sensitive to the president's political needs by saying
that the aides did not understand the obligations of being a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The political advisers, including Rahm Emanuel and Paul Begala,
said a White House adviser sought assurances from the lawyers that
the president's denial of a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
did not rely on an exclusion for oral sex. Last week there was ``an
intense feeling of personal betrayal,'' said a former White House
aide. Several White House aides and advisers said they were
uncertain whether the lawyers knew the assurances were disingenuous
at the time they were given.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Jan. 23, the lawyers, joined by Mickey Kantor, a
longtime adviser and friend of the president and Mrs. Clinton, were
insisting on a wall of silence. McCurry was asked whether the
president had told the full story of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky to his advisers. ``If, by advisers, if that includes his
attorneys, he may have,'' McCurry responded. ``But I can't answer
that, because he has not with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Also that Friday, the president reassured his Cabinet, who
gathered at the White House to discuss the upcoming State of the
Union Address, that he was innocent of accusations of having sex
with an intern and telling her to lie about it. ``I'm going to be
fine, and you will be, too,'' he told them. After the Cabinet
meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and three other
Cabinet secretaries met with reporters in a show of support for
Clinton. By this time, several top political advisers had also been
personally assured by the president that the accusations were
untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Over that weekend there was a barrage of new reports about Ms.
Lewinsky. Clinton conferred with Thomason and watched the Super
Bowl with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. His political situation seemed to
be worsening.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, with help from Thomason, who was watching a live
video feed from another room in the White House, Clinton had
practiced an emphatic, public denial. Wagging his finger and with
his wife standing by his side, Clinton told 200 people gathered in
the Roosevelt Room for a child-care policy meeting, ``I want you to
listen to me, I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Also present in the Roosevelt Room that day was Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., who found the president's denial reassuring
then, but last week said her faith in the president's credibility
had been ``badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was misleading, a strong and public categorical
denial from the president seemed to bolster both his legal and
political standing back in January. It seemed to give the Jones
lawyers and Starr little to work with. (Ms. Lewinsky was not yet
cooperating with prosecutors and in the Jones case she, too, had
filed an affidavit denying a sexual relationship). His denial also
energized Clinton's defenders, including his wife, who appeared on
the NBC program ``Today'' to defend him.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' poll also made it clear the voters, too, were most
comfortable with a denial, though he was soon excluded from the
group advising the president. A former White House aide said that
when word of Morris' possible reappearance reached Begala, he
threatened to quit if Morris was brought back. Begala declined
comment, while Morris said ``the lawyers felt the president should
not talk to me anymore because our conversations were not
privileged.'' Morris was called before Starr's grand jury last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months of denials, supplemented by a quasi-apology, have
hurt the president legally and politically, several former aides
said, with one saying Clinton turned an embarrassment into a
possibly impeachable offense. But another adviser stressed that the
president bought valuable time, months in which the White House has
denounced Starr and driven up his public disapproval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, the president's public denials about Ms.
Lewinsky were quickly followed by a successful State of the Union
address, which helped remind the voters why they elected Clinton.
Some aides were hoping last week that the president's order to bomb
terrorists' sites could have a similar effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of the past seven months has been heavy, whether or
not the president survives his legal and political troubles.
Current and former aides are only beginning to come to terms with
the fact that the president lied to them, too. In interviews last
week, several sounded deeply anguished.

RECEIVER IS READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Freshman receiver Freddie Mitchell is in fine
working order, finally. His hands work; he catches everything in
sight. His mouth works; he's not bashful about his accomplishments.
And this summer, his brain worked, clearing the way for Mitchell to
play for the first time in 21 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took one session of summer school, I did real good, got
everything straight, and I should be on a roll,'' said Mitchell, a
Lakeland, Fla., native who sat out last season because he didn't
attain a qualifying ACT score until October.
</P>
<P>
   He enrolled immediately and eventually joined UCLA's baseball
team as an outfielder. Academic concerns dictated he concentrate on
schoolwork and one sport, football. Eight summer-school units
later, he expects to be eligible this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get my fill of academics,'' he said. ``Now I've got a
year under my belt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, hoping Mitchell will energize their slumping
punt-return unit and replace Jim McElroy as the primary deep
threat, welcomed him aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a playmaker,'' receivers coach Ron Caragher said. ``His
routes are getting better, he catches the ball very well, and he
goes and gets it. It's too early to say if Freddie can be the
big-play guy that (McElroy) was, but he has that capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is UCLA's most flamboyant receiver, by far. On Sunday,
he made an acrobatic catch that pulled his shorts to his knees,
exposing his gold bicycle tights. He scrambled to his feet and
scampered through the defense, pulling his shorts up as he ran.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the coaches are trying to temper Mitchell's
enthusiasm, turn his cockiness into quiet confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sometimes we have to get on him,'' Caragher said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell entered training camp as the No. 1 punt returner and
the No. 2 flanker, behind veteran Dan Farmer. Brad Melsby, back
from two years of injury and illness, is the first-string split
end. Sophomore Brian Poli-Dixon, perhaps the most talented of the
group, is behind Melsby.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell doesn't plan on being No. 2 for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to see what the team needs,'' he said. ``I'm going
to try to be the deep threat, and on third-and-three, when they're
asking, `Who do we go to?' I want the rock going to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ON ONE LEG: The Bruins will have one scholarship punter/kicker
for the Texas game, All-American Chris Sailer, and here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Teams are allowed a maximum of 105 players. By telling Sailer's
backup, Zak Haselmo, to skip training camp, the Bruins created an
extra roster spot for three weeks. Haselmo, from Cabrillo High in
Lompoc, is expected to rejoin the team Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bruins have more time to evaluate walk-ons for
long-term potential. In recent years, they've uncovered walk-on
gems like Farmer and quarterback Drew Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   (One of the five current walk-ons is Newbury Park receiver
Russell Thomas.)
</P>
<P>
   That said, the plan implodes if Sailer gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   DROPPING BY: Venice High quarterback J.P. Losman, who committed
to UCLA in June, attended practice Saturday to evaluate his
competition: sophomore Drew Bennett and freshmen Scott McEwan, Ryan
McCann and Cory Paus.
</P>
<P>
   Losman, who has taken four summer-school sessions, plans to
graduate from Venice in December and enroll for the winter quarter
_ enabling him to participate in spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming to compete with these guys because Cade (McNown) is
leaving,'' Losman said. ``If I'm not here in the spring, they'll
have a big advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   RECRUITING UPDATE: Bernard Riley, a coveted defensive lineman
from Los Alamitos, watched practice Sunday and said he has trimmed
his list to eight schools: Arizona State, Florida State, Michigan,
Notre Dame, Texas, UCLA, USC and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Riley said UCLA and Florida State are his
favorites at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, 6-foot-2 and 300 pounds, is considered the top defensive
line prospect in the state. He plans to take five visits (the
maximum allowed) and decide in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to think about it during football,'' he said. ``I
don't want to get sidetracked with college football during my
senior year.''

PRO PLAYERS' MOTHERS HELP THEIR CHILDREN, AND THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Becky Gatling will never forget her introduction
to the real National Basketball Association. It was November 1991,
and she and her husband, Ray, were waiting outside a locker room
for their son Chris, then a rookie with the Golden State Warriors.
The game had been over for nearly an hour, and while most of the
fans had filed out of the arena, Becky Gatling was amazed by how
many were still hanging around, waiting for the Warriors to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying, `Oh, this is great, look at all these family
members,''' she recalled. ``Then a player came up to me and said,
`Mrs. Gatling, these are not family members. These are hoochie
mamas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The hoochie mamas, as the player called the female groupies,
were looking for Chris Gatling and his teammates. One interrupted
Becky Gatling's conversation with a player by jamming a card with
her phone number scribbled on it into the player's hand. Outside in
the parking lot, another ran after a player driving away in his
truck, screaming and waving her arms in a desperate attempt to get
his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `This is a crazy place,''' Becky Gatling said,
still sounding stunned at the thought. ``I told my husband, `This
is really an education.' It was like, welcome to the NBA!''
</P>
<P>
   Gatling shared that tale this weekend at the second annual
Mothers of Professional Basketball Players convention, held at a
hotel here on the shores of the Mississippi River. She was one of
75 women, most with sons in the NBA and also a handful whose
children play for the Women's National Basketball Association, the
American Basketball League and even the Harlem Globetrotters. They
turned out to laugh and learn, and to share with one another the
joys and pains of having a rich, famous and often relentlessly
scrutinized child.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bond between all of us because we've had a lot of
the same experiences and can relate to one another,'' said Georgia
West, mother of free-agent point guard Kevin Johnson. ``Before, I
felt alone with my feelings because my girlfriends didn't
understand, because their sons aren't in the NBA, but these ladies
do. We're like a support group. It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The mothers group was the brainchild of Charlotte Brandon, whose
son Terrell is a two-time All-Star point guard for the Milwaukee
Bucks. While attending the 1996 All-Star Game in San Antonio, she
was struck by the isolation of the players' mothers. Hardly any of
them knew each other, and many, according to Brandon, appeared to
be lonely and uncomfortable in the midst of the adoration being
poured on their sons.
</P>
<P>
   That weekend, she tossed the idea around with a few other moms,
and six months later, 23 mothers, including those of stars Grant
Hill, Gary Payton, Penny Hardaway, Shaquille O'Neal and Mark
Jackson, met in New York City to found the Mothers of Professional
Basketball Players.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the group's 90 members call themselves a sisterhood and
offer examples of the powerful bond they share: how Becky Gatling
received calls from nearly 30 mothers in a two-month period while
she was recovering from breast cancer surgery last spring, and how
Margje van der Weide, the mother of Indiana Pacers center Rik
Smits, flew all the way from the Netherlands to attend last year's
inaugural convention in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Gatling said she spoke with either Brandon, Marie Jackson, Helen
Mashburn or Lucille Harrison, the mother of Shaquille O'Neal, every
day. Brandon, who was diagnosed with cancer of the colon and liver
in 1993, was extremely helpful, sharing stories of how prayer and
faith helped her overcome the disease. The two built such a bond
that their frequent telephone conversations are beginning to
infringe on Chris Gatling's time with his mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group is great except for the fact that now when I call my
mother, she puts me on hold a lot of times because she's talking to
Mrs. Brandon,'' Gatling said in jest.
</P>
<P>
   Since he entered the league seven years ago, Gatling, now a
forward with the New Jersey Nets, has called his parents after
every game. And he is not alone. Nearly every mother said she spoke
with her son at least every other day during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be willing to bet that almost every player calls their
mother every day,'' said Janet Hill, the owner of a Washington
consulting firm and the mother of Grant Hill. ``That's not true of
most 20- to 30-year-old men, but because they have to deal with the
pressures of being traded, being a free agent, living in a foreign
city, being expected or even wanting to play when they're injured,
and being in the relentless media spotlight, they have the need for
constant sustenance. I talk to my son five out of seven days. He
calls me. There are mothers who would die to speak with their adult
sons that often.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The mothers say the camaraderie they enjoy stems from being able
to relax and not worry about one of the bitter fruits of their
sons' success: strangers who try to befriend them in hopes of
gaining access to the players' money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, the other mothers don't feel threatened, and I don't
feel threatened,'' said Carolyn Cato, whose son Kelvin was a rookie
with the Portland Trail Blazers last season. ``They're not out to
get me. I'm not out to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing inspiration from the basketball moms, Cassandra Sneed
Ogden, mother of Baltimore Ravens lineman Jonathan Ogden, started
the Professional Football Players Mothers Association earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   While comforting one another is a major goal, the basketball
moms are more than a social group. Life in the NBA is as much
business as it is basketball, and the mothers feel compelled to
tackle the off-the-court issues that can cause their sons problems.
At last year's convention, they had Horace Balmer, the league's
vice president of security, address them about the women and men
who prey on the players in a social scene that can sometimes be out
of control. Balmer told them about a woman who, after having sex
with players, would save the condom, freeze the sperm and give it
to her friends so they could try to get pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   And this weekend, Yolanda Brooks, a sports psychologist, and
Lonise Bias, a motivational speaker and the mother of University of
Maryland star Len Bias, who died of a drug overdose after being
drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1986, spoke about how the mothers
can help their sons navigate NBA life.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of the mothers, one of those dangers is the news
media. The rash of negative publicity that NBA players have
received within the past year _ including a report last year in The
New York Times that up to 70 percent of the players smoke marijuana
and drink excessively, and a Sports Illustrated article last spring
about players who have fathered numerous children out of wedlock _
had the moms on the defensive. Some even said they stopped watching
Oprah Winfrey's television show after she followed the Sports
Illustrated article with an episode on professional athletes, many
of whom were in the NBA, being negligent fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon, whose son Terrell has a 7-year-old son who was born out
of wedlock, said of the Sports Illustrated article: ``I didn't like
it, and none of the mothers liked it, because what they didn't
report was that while some of the men may have children out of
wedlock, some of these men are real fathers and not just with their
money. A lot of these men really love their children and are taking
care of them. I say if you're going to tell the story, tell the
whole story. But they're just looking for the dirt. All they want
is dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Jackson, the mother of Indiana point guard Mark Jackson,
added: ``This is a new day and a new era, and there are millions of
children born out of wedlock in society today, so why focus on
these players who are just living in what society dictates today? I
don't condone the behavior, but I do condone their right to
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their unhappiness with the coverage, the women were not
blind to the actions of many of the players. Indeed, Brooks, the
sports psychologist, drew cheers when she implored the mothers in a
Saturday morning seminar to ``teach your sons and daughters the
importance of parental responsibility, and that any male can make a
child but it takes a man to raise one.''
</P>
<P>
   Becky Gatling said: ``We know that these guys out here are not
angels. I tell Chris point blank, `You know, you need to zip it up
and keep it in your pants unless you've got all of this money you
want to give away.' I tell him to use a condom or don't do it at
all. I don't want any more grandchildren until I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The mothers' words can still fall upon deaf ears. Chris Gatling
has a 4-year-old daughter out of wedlock and two paternity suits
pending, his mother said. But it's not because he wasn't warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about the NBA is that when players achieve their
fame and notoriety, immediately somebody is in there trying to tear
down everything it took you 17, 18, 20 years to instill in your
child,'' said Pamela Martin, the mother of Los Angeles Clippers
guard Darrick Martin. ``That's why it's extremely important for you
to stay connected to him, whether he wants it or not at that time.
You have to continue to make the comments that they may not want to
hear. You can't forget that you're their mother, not their
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The mothers are also working collectively to advise players who
join the NBA without graduating from college to return to earn
their degrees. And they have prepared literature offering
guidelines on what to look for in an agent, and when the red flags
should go up.
</P>
<P>
   The moms involved other family members in this year's
convention, bringing the total number of participants in New
Orleans to 273, including 28 players. Chris Gatling, Terrell
Brandon, Malik Sealy and others sat on a panel discussing the
stresses of NBA life and came away impressed by the mothers' unity,
ambition and willingness to address weighty issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shock to me,'' Minnesota guard Stephon Marbury told
the women. ``I thought it was just going to be a bunch of mothers
hanging around and eating. But now I think every mother should come
to this, and every player should come. It should be a big event
because you all really have it going on.''

BOWEN PROBABLY OUT VS. PURDUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ It's looking unlikely that USC reserve tackle
Ken Bowen _ a two-year starter _ will be available for Sunday's
game against Purdue. He remains sidelined with a hyperextended
elbow and has not practiced in nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good for the game,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen's injury would be considered more serious, but he's
dropped as low as third-string on the depth chart at right tackle,
behind starter Matt Welch and Rome Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for him, I feel pretty good,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Trojans doubtful for the game are fullback Marvin
Powell (twisted knee) and defensive lineman Darren Collins, who has
stretched ligaments in his foot and was wearing a soft cast on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Mark Cusano, who missed a week with a hamstring
injury, has made ``huge'' strides, according to Hackett, and is
expected to play in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Collins, some more vital members of the defensive line
are nursing bumps and bruises. Defensive end Lawrence Larry (ankle)
and defensive tackle Aaron Williams (pulled groin) did not practice
Sunday. Both are considered day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Grant Pearsall remains out with a sore knee but
might return to practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Pearsall's sore knee is opposite the knee in which he tore
ligaments last year. Hackett said he wants to make sure he has
experienced reserves at his position and other spots where players
are returning from serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Center Eric Denmon missed most of last season after undergoing
knee surgery and wide receiver Larry Parker's practice time has
been limited after he redshirted last season with a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have strong backups so we don't put too much on
them,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Ife Ohalete is backing up Pearsall; Denmon's backup,
Matt McShane, was actually the No. 1 center after spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   __ Practice-only player: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward isn't
playing against Purdue because of poor academic performance, but
he's getting plenty of snaps and constantly making big plays in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   So is there a chance Hackett might place him back in the lineup
against the Boilermakers? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made that decision,'' Hackett said. ``I love watching him
practice and watching him play. He's a wonderful football player.
He knows he needs to raise his level of performance.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sudden impact: Quincy Woods put on a show Sunday with several
impressive receptions as he converts from quarterback to wide
receiver. He drew cheers from his teammates after catching a deep
pass over the shoulder from Jason Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quincy can help this football team,'' Hackett said. ``I'm
impressed (with his hands).''

DONALD TRUMP ADMIRER GUILTY OF DEFRAUDING HUNDREDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' California news file.) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Claiming Donald Trump and Mother Theresa as
references, it's no wonder Stephen Murphy had such an easy time
ripping people off.
</P>
<P>
   After federal investigators discovered that the self-proclaimed
homeless-man-turned-millionaire sold interest in buildings and
mini-malls he never purchased, Murphy pleaded guilty to six felony
charges last month and will be sentenced by a judge in November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of mostly elderly investors are marveling at
how easy it was for the social chameleon to take their money.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks, Calif., resident Rudy Kretschec, a 66-year-old
retiree, gave more than $15,000 to Murphy in 1992, hoping to make
money to pass on to his five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't get the feeling it was flim-flam. He was so good at
what he did, believe me, you would invest,'' Kretschec said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   He said Murphy found out about his Korean War experience and
used a ``veterans have to stick together'' approach to lure
investment funds. In Murphy's books, advertisements and television
appearances in the early 1990s, the 49-year-old said he was a
Vietnam veteran who used to live out of his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the American success story,'' Kretschec said.
</P>
<P>
   Kretschec was by no means alone, and Murphy is by no means the
last of the flim-flammers, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment fraud is the wave of the future,'' said FBI Special
Agent Dan Bolick, who specializes in fraud investigation in the Los
Angeles area. ``All of these other (scams) are getting smaller and
the one category that is getting bigger is investment fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy couldn't be reached, but his public defender, Ellen
Barry, pointed out that Murphy had plenty of legitimate business,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually was selling real estate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy owned American Capital Investments Inc., a company
supposedly set up for buying, operating and selling real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Painter said Murphy's first
program, Plaza Del Sol, solicited investments for a shopping center
that was never bought _ a fact that was concealed from investors.
He ended up raising more than $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of Murphy's beach-side Marina Del Rey office were
filled with kudos and accolades, including a picture of Mother
Theresa. Investors said Murphy pointed out a framed letter,
supposedly from Mother Theresa, when making his sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   His book, ``Formerly One Up on Trump,'' includes a complimentary
letter purportedly signed by The Donald himself.
</P>
<P>
   After telling investors that he had resold property at a large
profit, he urged them to ``roll over'' their funds to other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including Kretschec, were given monthly interest payments.
But prosecutors claim those payments came from other investors'
funds, not from ACI properties.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission finally caught up to
Murphy in the summer of 1993, and got a court order to freeze his
assets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Thom Mrozek called Murphy a con
man who will pay for his schemes with a prison term.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an environment with an overheated stock market, these
so-called securities gurus pose a particularly dangerous threat. As
we saw during the S&AMP;L crisis of the 1980s, con men have been
particularly effective in separating investors from their money,''
Mrozek said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Murphy pleaded guilty to five counts of mail fraud and
one count of making false statements to a financial institution,
Painter said. Murphy faces 55 years in prison, although the U.S.
Attorney's Office will recommend five years through a plea
agreement.

1992 and 1993 have no reason to feel like suckers.
</P>
<P>
   The list of people Murphy apparently fooled includes dozens of
journalists, politicians, religious leaders and Trump, who heaped
praise on Murphy in the forward to his book.
</P>
<P>
   In a signed statement in the beginning of the book, Trump is
quoted as saying: ``Steve's onto something, and he's got the
investment world looking over his shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The media embraced Murphy for his rags-to-riches story and
dedication to veteran and homeless affairs. Interviewers from Larry
King to Leeza Gibbons gushed over his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murphy's book, the Los Angeles City Council adopted
a resolution in 1992 honoring him for ``his commitment to overcome
adversity and despair and for his tremendous generosity in
providing an opportunity for others to strive for a better quality
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   He placed boastful full-page newspaper advertisements: ``Stephen
Murphy is a new breed of investor. Up front. Honest. Gutsy,'' one
headline read.
</P>
<P>
   The framed Mother Theresa letter was on the wall of his office,
along with framed properties that prosecutors and investors say he
never owned.
</P>
<P>
   John and Heljo Kredjze, 78 and 74 years old respectively, lost
hundreds of thousands of dollars to Murphy from a legal settlement
related to an injury that rendered their son quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kretschec, John Kredjze was drawn in from Murphy's first
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fast worker,'' Heljo Kredjze recalls. ``My husband is
not a very hard one to fool and Murphy made a very wonderful
picture of his plans and investment opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalls that Murphy picked up on Tchaikovsky playing on a
stereo in the Kredjzes' home during one of his first phone calls.
When the couple went to see one of Murphy's supposed investments in
Palmdale, the same piece of classical music was playing on the
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then that made me think that man was up to all kinds of
tricks,'' Heljo Kredjze said. ``My husband didn't see it that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kredjzes say they gave Murphy $350,000 from the legal
settlement, later adding more from John Kredjze's retirement
account.
</P>
<P>
   Bolick said people like the Kredjzes are typical targets for the
new wave of telephone criminals. ``The senior citizens are the ones
with a lot of money at their disposal. They can liquidate their
assets quickly and telemarketers know to target the dough,'' the
FBI agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Kretschec admitted that ``greed'' was a prime reason he got
sucked into Murphy's scheme. But human nature was a big factor,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if a guy is making a living I should give him the time
to listen to him,'' Kretschec said. ``Quite frankly, I still do
that, but I won't buy anything over the phone.''

   KINSHASA, Congo _ The battle lines in the Congo's three-week-old
civil war were redrawn Sunday as government soldiers and their
allies recaptured a critical military base near the Atlantic coast,
greatly reducing the possibility that rebel forces could march into
the capital here.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the rebels appeared to have seized Kisangani,
the country's third-largest city, solidifying their positions in
eastern Congo. Kisangani is also the port of origin for ships that
carry food and other crucial supplies downstream to countless towns
and villages along the great Congo River.
</P>
<P>
   The developments raised the possibility of a protracted war in
which the government and the rebels, backed by their respective
allies, would fight each other from entrenched geographic positions
in this country's second civil war in as many years. The military
advances also overtook diplomatic efforts, led by South African
President Nelson Mandela, to negotiate a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has pointed up the existing and emerging ethnic,
political and military rivalries in post-Cold War Africa. The
presidents of Rwanda and Uganda, the countries that Congo's
government and most Western diplomats believe are backing the
rebellion, attended the meeting led by Mandela in South Africa. But
Congo President Laurent Kabila, and his most vocal defenders, the
presidents of Zimbabwe and Angola, were not present to hear
Mandela's call for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Kinshasa remained eerily calm despite another night of a power
blackout imposed by the rebels as soldiers from Zimbabwe patrolled
the streets in flatbed trucks. Top aides to Kabila sounded
significantly more confident that the capital, which had seemed
ready to fall into advancing rebel hands any minute, would remain
under government control.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Kabila said, and the rebels acknowledged, that after
several days of bombing, the government and their Angolan allies
Sunday recaptured a military base in Kitona, in the far west. The
rebels had been flying troops and arms more than a thousand miles
from the territory they control in the east to Kitona, from which
they had begun their march toward Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the airport at Kitona will prevent the rebels
from replenishing their forces, Western diplomatic and
transportation experts said, even as rebels approaching the capital
are running into Congolese troops assisted by soldiers from
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature to say that Kinshasa won't fall now, but this
is a very difficult situation for them,'' said a Western diplomat
here.
</P>
<P>
   No one ruled out, though, that the rebels, who are said to be as
close as 15 miles from Kinshasa, might make a last-ditch attempt to
drive into this city. Indeed, a private transportation company
official with offices in the region said that rebel soldiers
boarded two trains Sunday in Matadi, a city about 220 miles
southwest of the capital that is under rebel control, and were
headed toward the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Sakombi Inongo, a senior communications adviser to
Kabila, credited Congo's allies with turning the tide for the
government in the region southwest of Kinshasa. ``We have men and
planes from Angola, and we have men and planes from Zimbabwe,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With Kitona recaptured by the government, the rebels also no
longer appear to be able to send fresh supplies by air to the
southwest, diplomats and transportation company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kitona airport was quiet Sunday night, officials said. They
also said that there were reports that there was little violence in
the eastern city of Kisangani, which the rebels said they
controled.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern town of Goma, along the border with Rwanda, a
rebel leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, said in a news conference
that rebel troops had ``arrived in Kisangani and Kisangani has
fallen,'' Reuters news service reported.
</P>
<P>
   Didier Mumengi, Kabila's information minister, said that
Kisangani had not fallen. But two other senior aides to Kabila did
not deny that rebels had captured Kisangani, and diplomats and
transportation company officials said they also had information
that the rebels had captured the city.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The apparent fall of the country's third-largest city is not as
significant as it was during the successful rebellion that Kabila
waged two years ago against Mobutu Sese Seko. Mobutu's 32-year rule
of the nation, which he called Zaire, turned one of Africa's
potentially richest countries into one of its poorest.
</P>
<P>
   During Kabila's efforts to win control of the country, Mobutu
moved foreign mercenaries into Kisangani to stop the rebellion from
the east. But Kabila, who was backed then by Rwanda and Uganda,
easily took the city on his way toward Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   But Kisangani's fall still entails strategic consequences,
Western diplomats said. The Congo River flows for 1,000 miles from
Kisangani to Kinshasa _ past cities, towns and villages that are
surrounded by some of the densest jungle in central Africa and are
inaccessible to trucks traveling in a country with possibly the
worst roads in the world.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no diplomatic solution to this conflict, some
experts predict a that Congo will split into two or more parts. The
rebels would end up controlling the northeast region near Rwanda
and Uganda, while the government would dominate in the west and
south.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, who left Kinshasa more than a week ago, remained Sunday
in the southern city of Lumbumbashi, in his native region, his
aides said. By not attending the conference in Pretoria, Kabila
avoided meeting with the leaders of Rwanda and Uganda, his former
allies, who had placed him at the head of the movement that led to
Mobutu's overthrow.

STOP TRAFFIC RUNS DOWN DIXIE FLAG TO WIN BALLERINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ They had a false start but a true
finish Sunday in the Ballerina Handicap at Saratoga, with the
5-year-old mare Stop Traffic outrunning five other fillies to win
by seven lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Stop Traffic not only stalked and ran down Dixie Flag, who had
sprinted into a long lead with some dizzying fractions, but also
buried the heavy favorite, Colonial Minstrel, who had won seven of
her last eight starts. And once she seized the lead in the
homestretch, Stop Traffic flew home far in front of two other late
runners, Runup the Colors and U Can Do It.
</P>
<P>
   The race was preceded, and even influenced, by a false start
when Runup the Colors and Furlough broke through the gate and
chased each other up the track. They were corralled, brought back
to the gate and then started in proper order. Jerry Bailey gunned
Dixie Flag into the lead with a dramatic dash that threatened to
steal the race, but Shane Sellers, aboard Stop Traffic, had no
intention of letting that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My filly charged the gate,'' Sellers said, ``and at the right
moment, it opened. So it seemed like the right timing. It was
obviously good for us that we got a good break, and when I saw
Jerry opening up with those quick fractions, I just decided to back
my filly up and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   He waited while Dixie Flag was shooting a quarter-mile in 21 3/5
seconds, opening a five-length lead, and spinning a half-mile in 44
2/5 seconds, still in front by three. But Stop Traffic was waiting
for the right moment to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think Jerry had much left in his filly just by the
way he was riding her, so I just wanted to save what my filly
had,'' Sellers said. ``Then, at the quarter-pole, I pulled the
trigger, and she opened up in the clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Mandella, the son and deputy to Dick Mandella, who trains
Stop Traffic, said: ``Some jocks will be tempted to go when they
break so well, but when Shane saw that Jerry Bailey wanted the
lead, he remained calm and took a hold. It worked well because we
had a target until the far turn. And when she had about enough of
that, she took off and was full of run.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Flag, after her mad dash, faded from first to sixth and
last. Colonial Minstrel suffered a rough start, chased the flying
leaders into the stretch but finished fifth. Furlough, another
favorite, also showed nothing in the face of all the razzle-dazzle,
finishing fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't run her race,'' said Mark Hennig, who trains
Colonial Minstrel. ``She must have hit the gate when the two other
horses broke through at the start. She had blood coming out of her
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confusion in the gate, Stop Traffic ran the seven
furlongs in 1 minute 22 1/5 seconds, paid $12.40 for a $2 bet to
win and earned $120,000. She is a 5-year-old daughter of Cure the
Blues, and she has won 10 times and run in the money 19 times in 23
starts.

<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, on the downtown IRT subway, I looked up from my book
and a clown looked back at me from the opposite seat. Her face was
painted titanium white, with large blue and yellow circles around
each eye _ no garish red lips though, and no funny nose. She wore
gigantic clown lace-up shoes, in brown. She held several large,
rumpled plastic bags. She was about 40, very thin and slumped in
her seat with a disgusted expression.
</P>
<P>
   At first no one paid any attention, but then she began a
performance that drew everyone's gaze. She reached into one of her
bags and pulled out a jar of cold cream, rummaged through another
and found a pack of tissues. She closed her eyes and slathered her
face thickly with the cream. De-clownification had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Without benefit of a mirror, she began roughly wiping her face
with tissue after tissue and got almost all her makeup off, save
for a touching patch of blue on one temple. She untied her clown
shoes and replaced them with a pair of Nikes, retrieved from the
bottom of a bag. She extracted a black scarf and wound it around
her neck. She brushed her hair. We all stared, fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   Were we privy to a backstage circus ritual? Were we unwitting
peeping Toms watching a lady at her toilette? Or were we watching
the world's canniest performance artist who knew that only a
performance in reverse _ a disillusioned clown turning the
theatrical into the ordinary _ would transfix a hardened subway
audience?
</P>

   Benjamin Doscher heard a New Yorker explaining the Grand

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Recently on a family trip to North Carolina, our 4{-year-old
son, Doron, was acting difficult. His justification was that he
missed Brooklyn, where we live. He proceeded to list all the things
he loved about the borough, including his friends and his favorite
activities. Out of frustration that we might never be able to take
a vacation again, we asked him if there might be some other place
he would be willing to travel to. He paused for a moment and then
replied, ``Manhattan.''

   There were only two passengers aboard a Madison Avenue bus late
one evening and Judy Bucey was startled out of her reverie by the
ringing of the other passenger's cell phone. The surprise turned to
amusement when the driver called out, ``If that's my wife, tell her
I'm not here.''
</P>
<P>
   On another Madison Avenue bus, two women in their upper middle
years were discussing the sweltering weather. Monica Sands
overheard the following exchange:
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``It's so hot today, I think I'll call off my
appointment with my acupuncturist.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman: ``Why do that? It might cool you off. With all
those needles poking little holes in you, you'll be well
ventilated.''

   Emery Davis, an orchestra leader who describes himself as
aggressive, recently had an unusual experience _ brought on by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was in a taxi on 57th Street, headed to Madison Square
Garden. ``Get on to Ninth Avenue, to 31st Street and then around to
the Garden,'' he instructed the driver. An old-time cabby, the
driver not only ignored him but also remained where he was, in the
slower of two lanes. Davis suggested that they might move a little
faster in the other lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you can do it better?'' the driver said in a
challenging tone. ``Yes,'' Davis said. The driver pulled over to
the curb. ``OK, you drive,'' he said. The two traded places and
Davis, using every ounce of his aggression, whizzed along his
preferred route. When they got to the Garden, Davis was so pleased
with himself, he added a generous tip. His reward: ``Not bad,'' the
driver said.

   Bothered by the litter of expired Metrocards at bus stops and

a Queens bus. A small homemade container beside the fare box
sported a sign that read, ``Cemetery for Used Metrocards. ''

   Basil C. Levine wasn't the only one amused by the comment of his
8-year-old granddaughter, Carling, as she inspected an abstract
sculpture at a Manhattan art gallery. The sculpture, titled ``The

Carling's reaction: ``If that's a dog, he's got a lot of
problems.''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Though a senior citizen, I still adhere to the rules of behavior
instilled in me as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, while seated in a subway car that had no
vacant seats, an elderly man, leaning on a cane, accompanied by a
young woman in her teens, entered the car and happened to stand in
front of me. I immediately jumped up and offered him my seat. He
thanked me and, apparently a gentleman of the old school of
manners, proceeded to offer my seat to the young woman who,
smilingly, accepted it. Talk of chutzpah!
</P>
<P>
   Standing over her and glowering, I said, ``Miss, I gave up my
seat for this gentleman, not for you. As you appear to be a few
years younger than both of us, and if this man does not want the
seat, please return it to me, its rightful owner.'' She started to
say something, thought better of it and gave back the seat. I was
pleased to note a number of looks of approval.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan doctor who, for obvious reasons, doesn't want his
name used, was standing near the door, about to get off the train
to the Hamptons when a man, also about to depart, joined him.
</P>
<P>
   The man look at the doctor and said ``Lovely tie. Hermes?''
``Yes,'' said the doctor. The man went on to further judgment.
``Gift,'' he said, with not even a question in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   How did he come to this conclusion? ``The rest of you is a
slob,'' he said, sotto voce. The train stopped, and the two got off
without a further word.
</P>
<P>
   A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP
</P>
<P>
   She said ``Come in, come in, come in!

</P>
<P>
   He was glad to share her table.

SOLICH CHARGED WITH MAINTAINING NEBRASKA'S WINNING TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ Imagining the scene is easy.
</P>
<P>
   Last August. Nebraska coach Tom Osborne, he of the medium cool
personality, knocks on the door of assistant head coach Frank
Solich. Osborne asks for a ``few minutes.'' Solich thinks his boss
wants to discuss the Cornhuskers' depth at I-back.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's monotone delivers the news that he plans on the 1997
season being his last and that he will recommend Solich as his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very nonchalant about it,'' Solich said last month
while sitting in the office that Osborne occupied for a quarter of
a century. ``It took about five minutes. Then he left.''
</P>
<P>
   The austere Osborne prided himself on consistency, of not
getting too high or too low during his 25 years as Nebraska's head
coach. Solich clings to the same tenets. But for once, Solich's
stoic, keep-your-keel-even demeanor was no match for the biggest
news of his coaching life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat there for a while,'' Solich said. ``I took a deep
breath. I had a tough time going back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement came Dec. 10 when Osborne announced
his retirement. Solich, a former Nebraska fullback and a 19-year
Cornhuskers assistant was chosen as Osborne's replacement. And when
Nebraska opens its 1998 season Saturday against Louisiana Tech in
the Eddie Robinson Football Classic, Solich gets his chance to
prove that he was the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 150 guys on the team, and not one of 'em wanted
anybody else but coach Solich,'' senior fullback Joel Makovicka
said. ``If you were going to find somebody who could handle the
pressure of following coach Osborne, it would be coach Solich.
They've both got the same air of confidence that trickles down to
the players.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the transition at Nebraska, a program of
habits, has been effortless. But that's the off-season perception.
There is the little matter of an upcoming season, the first one in
a quarter century without the angular Osborne on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get to that first game, get this thing rolling,''
said Solich, whose head-coaching experience consists of 13 seasons
as a Nebraska high school coach. ``I've got anticipation for the
first game. My approach has been to assume that we've done all we
can do to prepare for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel burdened. I feel a tremendous responsibility to
maintain the level we're at. I don't want to see it slip an inch.
I'm going to do everything I can to prepare myself and the players
to do that. If I looked too far down the road, I'd feel too
burdened. That would be pretty overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne was 35 when he took over for Bob Devaney in 1973. He
looked every bit of his 60 years when he coached his final game,
the 42-17 victory against Tennessee in the Orange Bowl that gave
the Cornhuskers a share of the 1997 national championship, their
third national title in the last four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Solich is a youthful-looking 53 years old. In a few years, one
wonders if Solich will resemble the ``before'' and ``after''
pictures of U.S. presidents who were aged by the stress of the job.
He keeps in shape running the Memorial Stadium steps five days a
week, but he has cut back on his regular weightlifting sessions.
</P>
<P>
   When it is suggested that he doesn't need to pump iron because
he's carrying the weight of a dynastic program on his back, he
laughs easily. Solich is relaxed. The pressure of the season starts
Saturday against Louisiana Tech, and never mind that Nebraska is a
341/2-point favorite and is again expected to be among the nation's
best teams.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, Solich has been familiar with the
Cornhuskers' perennial success. In the 36 years of the
Devaney-Osborne era, Nebraska never suffered a losing season; the
two worst seasons (6-4) came in 1967 and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   After spending his childhood in Cleveland, Solich came to
Nebraska in 1962. He was part of the first recruiting class of
Devaney, who started the Nebraska machine rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-7 Solich weighed less than 160 pounds. During weigh-ins
before the first practice, Solich snuck five-pound weights onto the
scale so that he wouldn't be the team's lightest player.
</P>
<P>
   He played three seasons for the Cornhuskers as a fullback. He
became the first Nebraska back to gain 200 yards in a game and he
still holds the Orange Bowl record for return yards. As a senior,
``Fearless Frankie'' was team captain and All-Big Eight Conference.
</P>
<P>
   And Solich was on his way to becoming a transplanted Nebraskan.
After his stint as a high school coach, a 35-year-old Solich joined
Osborne's staff in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He says he never had a goal, a drive to be a college head coach.
That developed over the years of working for Osborne. There was no
defining moment when he realized he wanted to become a head coach.
But gradually, he realized he was being prepared to succeed
Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   And with that realization came the itch to be his own coach.
Solich's reputation was growing. He started receiving feelers from
schools with openings ... and Osborne appeared far from retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have settled for a rebuilding program,'' said Solich,
who received cursory contact from Oklahoma State and Kansas for
openings at those schools. ``I wasn't holding out for this job.
This will be a tremendous challenge, but there are a lot of jobs
out there like that.''
</P>
<P>
   A curious series of events involving other coaches kept Solich
at Nebraska. In December 1995, Kansas coach Glen Mason changed his
mind and stayed in Lawrence after accepting the job at Georgia. But
a year later, when Jim Wacker left Minnesota, Mason took that job.
The other serious candidate was Solich.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to resurrect a Gophers program that has won 27
games over the last eight seasons, Solich takes over Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a handful programs around the country where if
you've got a chance to be the coach there, you grab it,'' Nebraska
athletic director Bill Byrne said. ``This is one of those jobs.
Nebraska is the kind of place where everything is in place to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all that's expected of Solich is to perpetuate Osborne's
success. Solich won't equal Osborne's longevity, but he knows he'll
be expected to match the assembly line that has averaged 10
victories each of the past 25 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers could go 14-0 and win the national championship,
which would better last year's 13-0 record. But 14-0 is the best
Solich can hope for. Anything less than 10 victories is likely to
set off alarm bells that the dynasty is cracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, we're going to lose some football games here.
But we're not gonna lose a lot,'' Byrne said. ``We're in this with
Frank for the long term. I consider coaches' success to be gauged
as a marathon, not a sprint. We'll get an idea of Frank's success
in three or four years. But I don't think things are going to be a
lot different than what we've seen in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't think about the saying that nothing lasts forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never operated out of the fear of failure,'' Solich said.
``I don't see that as a negative, the amount of games we've won in
the past. I'm not worrying about the record Tom put up last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Orange Bowl, Osborne tried to make Solich's first
season a little easier by saying the Cornhuskers might be an 8-3
team even with a coach named Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the expectations are,'' Solich said. ``Some people
might have 8-3 expectations, but I haven't into run into many of
'em. They don't seem to ask me how we're going to do, they tell me
what we're going to do. That's a little nerve wracking. I know how
the business works. Who is Frank Solich to think I won't be
criticized? I believe I'll be able to handle what comes my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this coaching change is
the fact that on that August day, Osborne entrusted his No. 1
assistant with keeping a secret that few people could have kept.
For four months, Solich went about his job as usual, keeping his
emotions in check, helping coach a team he knew would soon be his
own, knowing that he would be taking over for a coaching legend.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that meeting with Osborne more than a year ago, Solich
remembers that he was reluctant even to call his wife with the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited for dinner that night, and then I told her,'' he
said. ``And I crossed my fingers and hoped that she wouldn't tell
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Secrets, like All-America offensive linemen, national rushing
championships and 10-victory seasons, apparently are becoming
Nebraska trademarks. Solich is in charge of keeping the copyright
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we approach things offensively and defensively won't
change,'' he said. ``Philosophically, it will be the same. But yet,
you always are open to change. If change is needed, we'll do it. We
don't change for change's sake. What we've done is hold on to
what's made us successful with some slight adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to look for ways to make a mark on this program.
I don't think I need my own niche. The program has accomplished a
tremendous amount over the years, and it would be ridiculous to
throw aside the things that make it great.''

 ROSENDALE, N.Y.: over zoning and parking. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer, the tumbledown Grange Hall presented a season's
worth of experimental plays for crowds of 80 people a night, but in
October the town building inspector closed the hall, saying it
lacked a fire wall and proper wiring. Walter Helmuth, a retired
cameraman who bought the building 25 years ago for $12,500, said he
and a local theater group did not believe they could raise the
$60,000 that repairs would have cost.
</P>
<P>
   Another incident took place away from the town center, but it
crystallized fears about what a new cultural era would bring. For
many years, the town has held a street festival with musicians and
vendors that draws 30,000 people. Two years ago, that event was
followed by a concert at the Widow Jane Mine that became known as
the ``Rave in the Cave.'' More than 3,000 tickets were sold _ the
supervisor claims that 5,000 people attended _ and the event ended
up clogging roads. There was a small fire that organizers put out,
but firefighters trying to get to the site were frustrated by the
traffic, and let officials know.
</P>
<P>
   Town Board members, citing a violation of residential zoning
laws, sued the mine's owner, the Century House Historical Society,
whose president is Dietrich Werner, a leader of the insurgent
Democrats. Ultimately, Justice Vincent Bradley of state Supreme
Court in Kingston ordered a limit of 750 people at future mine
events.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents say they wish the dispute would be ironed out so
life can return to its characteristic quiet. ``I'm hoping they
figure this out,'' said Ms. Wetzel, the Women's Studio founder,
``because the Old Guard isn't going to disappear, and I don't like
the idea of the New Guard taking over like a charge.''

CULTURES CLASH OVER THE VIEW FROM MAIN STREET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSENDALE, N.Y. _ This country town had something of a raffish
reputation long before the artists and hippies began showing up
three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rosendale's limestone hills produced the natural cement used in
the foundations for the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty,
and many older residents still remember when thirsty miners could
choose from 14 bars along boisterous Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   The last cement mine closed in 1971, and the town's
unpretentious and tolerant tradition served it well during the
influx of painters, musicians, flower children, New Age
spiritualists and gay people who made no secret of their
homosexuality. The town, in Ulster County two hours north of
Manhattan, seemed to absorb them in stride.
</P>
<P>
   But the newcomers are not so new or young anymore. They have
come to constitute at least a quarter of the town's 6,220
residents, and many of them want a greater voice in determining its
destiny, particularly that of its pleasantly anachronistic Main
Street.
</P>
<P>
   They want to give Main Street a more cultural flavor. Although
they have no master plan, they want to convert a ramshackle Grange
Hall, where farmers' wives once sewed quilts, into a theater for
experimental plays. They want to hold rock concerts in the Widow
Jane Mine, a defunct shaft. They want livelier shops and
restaurants and more trees along the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Many old-timers, however, are bridling, not, they say, because
the so-called newcomers' lifestyles are idiosyncratic, but because
their vision for Main Street ignores several realities. There is
not enough parking, they say. Most forsaken storefronts have
already been converted into modestly priced homes. The town, which
in the most recent census had a median family income of $36,875,
cannot afford to pay for sidewalk improvements, town leaders say.
Most importantly, the old-timers say, the newcomers are cavalier
about fire and safety laws.
</P>
<P>
   Many old-timers, in fact, would not mind keeping Rosendale as
sleepy as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll turn this town into a Woodstock,'' says Burt Johnson,
the town's crusty dog warden.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get rid of us old-timers and take over the
town,'' says Hatch Van Kleeck, a retired engineer who has lived in
and around Rosendale all his life.
</P>
<P>
   High noon in the battle for the soul of Rosendale is
approaching. In the Sept. 15 Democratic primary, Scott Cranin and
Brian Cafferty, two leaders of the insurgents, are running, along
with seven allies, for nine of the 10 seats on the Rosendale
Democratic Committee, which will select candidates for town
supervisor and Town Board in the 1999 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The discord in Rosendale is typical of social tensions that crop
up in mall-battered towns trying to revitalize their main streets,
according to the National Main Street Center in Washington, a
division of the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation,
which gives grants for preservation projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figuring out what the future of the downtown will be calls
into play a lot of conflicts that are inherent in a community
already,'' said Kennedy Lawson Smith, director of the center. ``The
key is getting every group on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rosendale's case, Cafferty and Cranin, who are gay, attribute
much of the resistance to an undertow of discomfort with the
unconventional immigrants, who have grown stronger as their numbers
have increased. The two men remember the posters defaced with
anti-gay slurs during last year's election campaign, in which
Cafferty, a 39-year-old television commercial salesman, lost the
race for supervisor by roughly 100 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They view artists, writers, gay people, musicians as a threat
to their existence,'' said Cranin, 41, of the town leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannie Fleming-Laik, the victorious town supervisor and a nurse
by profession, rejects charges of bigotry, and says the political
leadership has always been broad-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, nobody cares what your lifestyle is,'' Ms. Laik said.
``It never was a problem until it was convenient to say it was a
problem.'' She said she believed that Cafferty and Cranin were
making their charges for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not homophobic. I have nothing against the arts
community. But we represent a large cross section of the
community,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tension, good feelings predominate. ``Rosendale is
very tolerant,'' said Jodi Palinkas, a co-owner of a
vintage-clothing store. ``I don't get a feeling of any clashing of
two worlds. I get this really good Mayberry feeling here.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita Wetzel, who helped found the Women's Studio Workshop 24
years ago as a visual arts center, said artists have never been
hassled. ``This political thing has stirred more antagonism'' than
she has ever known, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosendale's Main Street once had shops that sold meat, hardware
and prescription drugs. But the large malls in nearby Kingston
killed the shops. The sign for Vaughn's Pharmacy can be hazily
detected under the painted face of one house.
</P>
<P>
   Today's shops are a rather eclectic mix that reflects the town's
split personality. There is a barbershop, a print shop, a law
office and a movie theater that charges $3 for first-run films. But
there is also a vegetarian cafe known for its first-class music, a
glass-blowing studio in an abandoned church, two antiques stores
and a video store owned by Cranin that has 21 Ingmar Bergman
titles.
</P>
<P>
   The artists and other newcomers, drawn here by country calm,
cheap rents, a populace that wasn't priggish and a longing for
community, say they don't want to see the town gentrified with
chain stores and boutiques or developed into another Woodstock,
whose often-crowded Main Street has several tourist shops selling
'60s schlock.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some shopkeepers and landlords complain that every effort
to open something new in town is met with grinding battles over
zoning and parking.

COWBOYS' BENSON SIDELINED WITH KNEE INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Any postgame euphoria from the Cowboys over
their first solid offensive performance of the preseason was
tempered yesterday when it was revealed that defensive tackle
Darren Benson was lost for the season with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Benson _ who went down late in second half of Saturday's 22-14
loss to the St. Louis Rams, which was highlighted by an impressive
showing by the Cowboys first-team offense _ was diagnosed with
sprained right knee after the game.
</P>
<P>
   But a magnetic resonance imaging test detected a torn anterior
cruciate ligament. The fourth-year tackle is scheduled to have
season-ending surgery in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third major knee injury of the preseason for the
Cowboys, who lost linebacker Broderick Thomas and cornerback
Wendell Davis to season-ending knee injuries during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   A subdued Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said the loss of Benson was
a major setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was playing really well,'' Gailey said. ``He worked
himself into a great position to play a lot on our football team.
So it hurts a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson's injury leaves the Cowboys with just two healthy
defensive tackles in Antonio Anderson and Chad Hennings for
Thursday's final preseason game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   All-Pro defensive tackle Leon Lett, who has been out the past
two weeks with a sprained left knee, is expected back for the
season opener Sept. 6 against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys plan to use Anderson to backup at both tackle spots
when Lett comes back. Defensive ends Hurvin McCormack and Michael
Myers will also help out at tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Making Benson's injury tough is that it came just as the Cowboys
were rounding out their roster for tomorrow's reduction to 60
players. Gailey, who said the Cowboys would have had more
flexibility if the injury had occurred during training camp, said
the team would not try to add a player to replace Benson.
</P>
<P>
   While injury is bad for the Cowboys, it's worse for 6-foot-7,
308-pound Benson, who was finally looking like he was going to live
up to the enormous potential the Cowboys saw in him when they
drafted him in 1995 at age 20 after just two years of
junior-college football at Trinity Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With no major-college football background, the youthful Benson
had trouble adjusting to the pro game. He drew attention in 1996
when he quit the team during spring minicamps because he wanted to
work in construction. The Cowboys talked him back to the team for
training camp, but he suffered another setback when he tore the
anterior and medial collateral ligaments in his left knee and was
lost for the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   He battled back to make the team last season and thanks to the
maturing process was on the brink of being a solid contributor this
season as Hennings' primary backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tougher on him than it is on us,'' Gailey said.

TRANSIT SYSTEM TIGHTENS SCRUTINY OF DRIVERS' HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hoping to prevent accidents like the fatal crash last
year caused by a chronically ill bus driver who had a seizure at
the wheel, New York City Transit is revamping what officials have
conceded is a flawed system for tracking its employees' health.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year's crash on Fifth Avenue, officials said, the
agency has reviewed the medical files of 16,000 bus drivers, subway
motormen and other workers for seizures and related disorders. It
has taken three bus drivers and a motorman off active duty, and it
is computerizing a record-keeping system so fragmented that doctors
at one agency medical center are often unaware of a worker's
separate file at another center.
</P>
<P>
   And in response to a critical state investigative report last
month, the agency forced the retirement of a doctor found to have
ignored instructions in 1994 to insure that the driver in last
year's crash received treatment for alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has also set up a task force of medical, legal and
worker's compensation officials to meet and share information on
the attendance, accident and health records of workers who might
pose safety risks.
</P>
<P>
   But New York City Transit officials said they were still
troubled at having to rely largely on employees themselves for
medical information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult situation,'' said Al O'Leary, a
spokesman for the agency. ``There's an incentive for them not to
tell us'' about health problems, he said, because employees who do
so can end up on restricted duty and lose thousands of dollars a
year in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four workers taken off active duty have had
accidents on the job related to medical conditions, O'Leary said.
The train operator, however, told doctors that he had passed out
before having an accident in his own car, O'Leary said. And several
transit employees who spoke on condition of anonymity said that one
of the bus drivers had been in a minor accident after passing out
behind the wheel but that the crash had been hushed up at the
depot.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agency has also begun reviewing files to see whether there
are employees with unresolved drug or alcohol problems who should
not be in ``safety-sensitive'' jobs like driving a bus or a train.
</P>
<P>
   According to last month's report by the State Public
Transportation Safety Board, the driver in last year's crash,
Charles Alston, had sought treatment several times for alcoholism,
but was allowed back on the road without having completed
treatment, at one point against the instructions of the transit
department's deputy medical director.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty in keeping track of workers with
substance abuse problems, said the agency's president, Lawrence
Reuter, is that if their problems have not yet been detected by the
management, they can enroll in a confidential union-run treatment
program. Even if they drop out of the program, management is not
notified.
</P>
<P>
   The union maintains that without the guarantee of
confidentiality, many employees with addictions would not seek help
at all.

BICYCLIST WITH WATER GUN IS SHOT BY POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 16-year-old bicyclist in Brooklyn who was carrying
a water pistol was shot and critically wounded early Sunday by two
police officers who were responding to a call about a man with a
gun and who apparently mistook the teen-ager's toy for a real
weapon, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, Michael Jones, was riding his bicycle with a
friend at the intersection of Clifton Place and Bedford Avenue in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, at about 2:40 a.m. when two
plainclothes officers who had been sent to look for a gun-wielding
bicyclist jumped from their car, ordered him to drop his gun and
then opened fire, said Sgt. Gerry Falcon, a Police Department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, who was shot several times in each leg, was listed in
critical condition Sunday night at Kings County Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned friends and family members said that Michael, who had no
criminal record before the incident, had sprayed friends with the
water gun all day Saturday at a nearby block party. Sunday, the
police charged Michael with menacing.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of Michael Jones was one in a series of incidents
in which teen-agers and younger children have been shot _ and, at
times, killed _ by police officers who have mistaken toy guns for
real weapons. Congress has ordered manufacturers to decorate toy
guns with neon colors to label them as fakes, and many chain stores
will not sell toy guns that can be painted to look real.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the police said, the gun resembled a particularly
lethal semiautomatic handgun that has long been a favorite of drug
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently it was a water gun, but it was a very, very
realistic replica of a Tec-9,'' said Marilyn Mode, the department's
deputy commissioner for public information. Tec-9's are
semiautomatic pistols with ventilated five-inch barrels and
magazines that can hold 32 bullets; easily altered to fire as
submachine pistols, they have long been considered the gun of
choice for drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The police department said that Sgt. Michael Jacobellis, 43, and
Police Officer David Gross, 26, opened fire on Michael Jones after
he pulled what appeared to be a large gun from his waistband and
ignored their orders to drop it. But Jermain Congress, 18, who was
riding his bike alongside Michael, said in an interview Sunday that
Michael had either dropped or was dropping the water pistol when
the officers shot him.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's family questioned why the teen-ager would want to hold
onto a water pistol as he was stopped by the police. ``What was he
going to do, spray them in the eyes?'' asked his uncle, Randy
Jones, 36. ``It doesn't make any sense. If they said freeze, he
wouldn't pull a play gun on them.''

VELARDE PUMPED FOR TRIP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ While some Angels are nonchalant about a
10-game road swing that begins today in New York and will test
their mettle against the best teams in the American League, Randy
Velarde is exuberant.
</P>
<P>
   He is healthy, his two-run triple in the seventh inning on
Sunday afternoon at Edison Field gave the Angels a 3-2 victory over
Toronto, and he's going home to the Bronx, where he played for nine
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge for me to be going back to the old stomping
grounds,'' said Velarde, who collected his 13th and 14th RBI of the
season with that triple. ``You always want to do better when you go
home and this will be an exciting trip for us. It will be a good
measuring stick for us and we'll see what we're made of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pre-playoff preparation, if you will. It's a crucial time
of the season, and every game is a `must' for us.''
</P>
<P>
   On a muggy, 90-degree day, Chuck Finley (10-6) won a game for
only the second time in 10 starts, allowing six hits and the two
runs in 72/3 innings. He walked one and struck out seven, including
the side in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival mopped up to earn his 35th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when the good players get it done,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``It's a great time of the season, and I want
us to go on this trip and have some fun. I don't have to tell them
about the meaning of this trip. They're all adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a great series with the Yankees and with football
starting up, we need the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out and runners on second and third in the eighth
inning, Finley knew he was pitching to his final batter, Toronto
right fielder Shawn Green. With the count 3-2, Finley, a 6-foot-6
lefty, threw one low and away to the left-handed-hitting Green, who
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was either going to walk him or he was going to swing at it
in the dirt,'' Finley said. ``And he went fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Percival came on with two out to face Jose Canseco, striking him
out looking to the delight of the crowd of 34,142.
</P>
<P>
   Percival walked Carlos Delgado to start the ninth, then struck
out Jose Cruz Jr., again looking. After Percival's first pitch to
third baseman Tony Fernandez, Matt Walbeck threw a one-hop strike
to Velarde at second base to get Delgado trying to steal.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended on Percival's next pitch, as Fernandez bounced
out to Velarde. Velarde shook a few hands and scampered into the
dugout, but that didn't match the claps and smiles he displayed
after his seventh-inning triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an emotional player,'' he said. ``And it was a huge hit.
We had them on the ropes a couple of times and couldn't get the big
hit. And I haven't played much in two years, so I had it all
bottled up.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays starter Woody Williams, who has a history of fading
after the sixth inning, was yanked from the game after six innings
for Carlos Almanzar.
</P>
<P>
   And the Angels wasted no time in getting to Almanzar (1-1), as
Walbeck greeted him with a single to right off a 3-1 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Paco Martin followed with a bunt along the first-base line,
which Toronto first baseman Delgado pounced on. But Delgado threw
in the dirt to shortstop Alex Gonzalez at second and both runners
advanced a base when the ball squirted into the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro popped out to short.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Velarde, who said he was comfortable when he stepped
into the box. ``And when you're comfortable, you're confident,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde missed all of last season when he injured his right
elbow in spring training, and he had reconstructive surgery
pioneered by Tommy John a month later. Further problems with that
injury have shelved him for stints this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a split-finger fastball, and on a 1-and-2 pitch I was
just trying to hit it to the big part of the park,'' Velarde said.
``That's exactly what I did.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored first, when Cruz led off the second by
doubling down the left-field line. He moved to third on a flyout by
Fernandez, then scored on catcher Mark Dalesandro's single to
right. The Angels bounced back in the bottom of the inning with a
run of their own when Walbeck hit a one-out fly to right with the
bases loaded, scoring Garret Anderson. Martin, spelling Gary
DiSarcina at shortstop, followed that with a deep fly to Shannon
Stewart in left, which Stewart caught as he backpedaled onto the
warning track.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto forged ahead in the fifth when Fernandez led off with a
single, took second on Dalesandro's flyout to center and scored on
a Gonzalez two-out double.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, the Angels' third-string center fielder behind Jim
Edmonds and Reggie Williams, played Gonzalez a bit too shallow.
When he finally had a gauge on the drive, it had sailed over his
head and bounced over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley struck out the side in the sixth, retired the side in
the seventh and got out of trouble in the eighth when he let
Percival finish the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to keep guys healthy,'' Finley said. ``This is
nice to see. Two or three months ago, with all the injuries we had,
there weren't many people who thought we'd be in this position. And
here we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge homestand for us. We felt like we were playing
teams we could beat, and now we have to take it to New York. Now
we're in position to do some big things on the East Coast.

AT 62, PLAYER PROVES HE IS STILL IN STEP WITH GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERICHO, N.Y. _ Striding down the fairway together at the Meadow
Brook Club here Sunday, Gary Player, showing a touch of gray, and
Lee Trevino, gray and somewhat stockier, evoked memories of their
glory days of two decades ago during the final round of the
Northville Long Island Senior PGA Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than being pursued by young turks, as was usually the
case in the 1960s and '70s, the 62-year-old Player and the
58-year-old Trevino were pursuing a ``young'' turk, 51-year-old
Walter Hall, after he birdied the first hole to take a one-stroke
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Player, who started the day two strokes off the lead, caught
Hall and the second-round co-leader, Tom Shaw, at the 11th hole
after consecutive birdies as all three stood at 11 under par.
Player, the winner of 172 tournaments in a 46-year professional
career, including nine Grand Slams, recorded his fourth birdie of
the day at the 401-yard par-4 16th hole. He overtook Hall and went
on to shoot his third straight 68 and win his first Senior PGA
tournament in three years, finishing at 12-under-par 204 for a
one-shot victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, a former sales executive who never played on the regular
PGA Tour and was seeking his first victory since joining the senior
circuit last year, shot a 69 to tie for second with 57-year-old
J.C. Snead, who finished with a 67. Trevino, the winner of a record
27 Senior PGA tournaments, including this one twice, was a stroke
back at 206 after a final-round 69.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the $150,000 first prize _ which came a day after he
had won $18,000 for winning the ``superseniors'' 36-hole
tournament-within-a-tournament for players in the field 60 and over
_ Player became the second oldest player to win a Senior PGA event.
The oldest was Mike Fetchick, who won a tournament in 1985 on his
63rd birthday. Player, who plays the senior tour infrequently
because he is busy designing golf courses, also has a golf
equipment company and his horse ranch in his native South Africa.
He will turn 63 on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rewarding and very gratifying to do this,'' said
Player, who has long espoused physical fitness and is still as fit
and trim as he was in his prime and doing at least 1,000 situps
every day. ``It shows what you can do when you exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Player's nerves and tenacity, along with his penchant for
fitness and his shotmaking skills, have always been hallmarks of
his career. And he said his nerves were the key to his victory on
this warm overcast day. ``I had tremendous control of my nerves
today, which I did not yesterday,'' said Player, who had five
birdies and only one bogey. ``I felt very serene from the time I
woke up this morning and kept that mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   Steady all-round play also was a factor. ``I don't think I was
ever in the rough,'' said Player, who never missed a fairway and
putted superbly.
</P>
<P>
   Nerves may have hurt Hall at the end when he missed birdie putts
of about 6 feet on the last three holes. Had he made one of them,
he could have forced a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was asked whether Player had an edge in that regard at the
end? ``Absolutely,'' replied Hall, who, until he went on the Asian
golf tour in 1984, had spent three decades in sales. ``He's been
there a thousand times.''
</P>
<P>
   Player, who received a hug and kiss from Trevino on the 18th
green after they had finished their round, said he saw no reason
why he should not continue winning tournaments. ``I think I can
still win at 70,'' he said this weekend. ``And I think someone will
win the Masters in their 60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be Player, who has already won three titles at Augusta
National? ``If I worked at it, I believe I could still do it,''
said Player, who this year became the oldest man ever to make the
cut at the Masters.

UMPIRE UNDER INVESTIGATION DENIES SELLING BALLS FROM PERFECT GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Clark, the umpire under investigation in the sale
of baseballs supposedly used in David Wells' perfect game, denied
emphatically on Sunday that he had anything to do with the sale of
the balls. He also said he could not understand why major-league
baseball would not believe the man who said he sold the balls and
signed Clark's name to a letter authenticating Wells' signature.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who was on vacation when news of the investigation
surfaced last week, said he had not talked to any of the security
people handling the investigation, but he said he spoke with Gene
Budig, the American League president, weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Gene a long time ago whatever the bottom line is, the
bottom line is I didn't do it,'' Clark said by telephone from his
home in Williamsburg, Va. ``I had no knowledge of it. I didn't
write the letter, I didn't sign the letter and I certainly don't
condone the letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which bore Clark's signature, accompanied six balls
that Mark Lewis, a memorabilia dealer from Long Island, N.Y.,
bought from Rich Gressle, of Milburn, N.J., who is a friend of
Clark's. Gressle said on Friday that he wrote the letter and signed
Clark's name to it, but that Clark knew nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told people at major-league baseball when this first started
that Al had nothing to do with this, but nobody wanted to believe
that,'' Gressle said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he did not know why baseball officials would not
believe Gressle. ``Do you know anybody who would implicate himself
in something like this?'' Clark asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who returns to work Monday night, said he met Gressle a
number of years ago in Trenton, N.J. Gressle said they have been
friends for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a friend of mine; I won't deny that,'' Clark said.
``I've got nothing to hide. I think he just infringed on a
friendship. Like he said, the motivation was greed and money. He
thought he could make some easy money.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he spoke with Gressle once about seven weeks ago
after he learned of the investigation. ``I asked him what it was
all about,'' Clark said. ``He said he screwed up. He said he made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's name has been mentioned before as an umpire who asks for
items from players and clubs. ``With stuff like this, his name
always comes up,'' said one baseball official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark said he did not know why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asked for autographed balls,'' he said, ``and I give
them to charities and auctions and golf tournaments and those
things, just like other umpires do. I've given stuff away, but I've
never sold anything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lewis, the dealer in Centereach, N.Y., said last week he had
bought memorabilia on several occasions from Gressle, including
items from the 1995 game in which Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's
record for consecutive games. Clark was the third base umpire in
that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood the balls came from Clark and other umpires,''
Lewis said, speaking generally of the memorabilia, ``but the
majority from Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 50, said he did not know Lewis, had had no dealings with
him and had never spoken with him. Did he think Gressle might have
sold Lewis memorabilia?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine he did, but I do not know that for sure,'' the
umpire said. ``Have I given Richie Gressle some stuff before? Yes.
Have I been paid for it? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Why has he given Gressle items? ``He's got two kids,'' Clark
said. ``He's a collector. He enjoys that stuff. It was for personal
use only.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a 23-year AL umpire, said he learned of the investigation
from Richie Phillips, the head of the umpires' union. ``I told him,
`I don't know what you're talking about,''' Clark recalled. ``I had
no knowledge that this was happening, that this man wrote the
letter, that he forged my signature. I am completely a victim in
this thing.''

YANKS TRADE FOR TWO MINOR-LEAGUERS TO BOLSTER BULLPEN 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The New York Yankees traded for two
minor-league pitchers Sunday to bolster their stock of right-handed
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Brian Cashman sent the former No. 1 draft pick
Shea Morenz and minor-league pitcher Ray Ricken to San Diego for
Jim Bruske and Brad Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Bruske, 33, was Cashman's primary objective in the deal.
The pitcher spent most of this season with the Los Angeles Dodgers
before San Diego acquired him on July 23. The Padres optioned him
to Class AAA Las Vegas shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Bruske was 3-0 with a 3.48 earned run average with the Dodgers
and allowed three runs in seven innings for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries to Jeff Nelson and Darren Holmes, and
because right-handers Marty Janzen and Scott Brow have pitched
poorly for Class AAA Columbus, the Yankees are somewhat
short-handed in right-handed relief.
</P>
<P>
   Bruske will probably not be part of the Yankees' postseason
roster, but he will most likely be called up for September and used
in middle relief.
</P>
<P>
   Others likely to be promoted from Columbus, along with Bruske,
when the rosters expand: catcher Mike Figga, outfielders Shane
Spencer and Ricky Ledee, and pitchers Mike Jerzembeck and Mike
Buddie.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, 25, was 9-9 with a 6.39 ERA for Las Vegas. Both he and
Bruske will report to Columbus. To make room for Bruske on their
40-man roster, the Yankees designated Brow for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Morenz, a 24-year-old outfielder, was the Yankees' No. 1 pick in
the 1995 draft and never matched the team's expectations for him,
batting .252 with 15 homers for Class AA Norwich this year. The
Padres wanted to draft Morenz, but lost out to the Yankees. John
Moores, the owner of the Padres, is a friend of the Morenz family.
</P>
<P>
   Ricken, 24, the Yankees' fifth-round pick in 1994, was 0-3 with
a 7.32 ERA for Norwich.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, coming back from tendinitis in his shoulder,
will probably start the first game of Wednesday's doubleheader
against Anaheim, and Hideki Irabu, coming back from a bruised foot,
is expected to pitch Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But as the playoffs draw near, Manager Joe Torre must decide who
will start and who will move to the bullpen. Several weeks ago, it
seemed sure that Orlando Hernandez would be moved to middle relief.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez has been much more aggressive in recent starts,
pitching inside more to left-handed batters, and this may increase
the odds of him remaining in the rotation in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that he's getting both sides out,'' said Torre, referring
to right-handed and left-handed batters, ``it makes for a tough
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wells and David Cone, candidates for the American League
Cy Young Award, are all but assured of being in the rotation for
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If Hernandez is a starter in the playoffs, that will probably
mean that Irabu will shift to the bullpen. Those decisions, Torre
said, won't be made until well into September. ``Then we'll just
see who's pitching well,'' he said. ``We'll do what we have to to
win.''

McGWIRE HOME RUN TOUR KEEPS ROLLING ALONG  
(nk) 
 By BILL MODOONO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The elements of a rock concert are present,
certainly _ the large crowds, the thunderous applause, the curtain
calls. Even the celebrities visiting backstage. But as the Mark
McGwire home run tour continues its astounding summer run, other
comparisons are becoming appropriate as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, before another sellout crowd at Three Rivers Stadium,
McGwire turned in a performance worthy of a minimalist art show. In
the 89-degree heat, he chose not to take batting practice. He
limited his pregame exercise primarily to stretching. When he
waited on deck during the game, he took no practice swings. When he
went out to his first base position, he did not jog until he
crossed the third-base line.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, he delivered the masterpiece _ a picture-perfect
home run into the sun-kissed bleachers in left field in his final
at-bat, which gave him 53 homers for a season that seems headed for
the record books.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' Sammy Sosa, also chasing the single-season homer mark
of 61, hit Nos. 51 and 52 against the Houston Astros Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish every baseball player could feel what I'm feeling
now,'' McGwire said minutes after his St. Louis Cardinals lost,
4-3, to the Pittsburgh Pirates before 42,134 fans, all of whom
seemed to be bigger fans of his than they were of the home team.
</P>
<P>
   After grounding out, walking twice and hitting a double in his
previous four appearances, McGwire hit a 2-2 fastball off Pirates
reliever Ricardo Rincon in the eighth inning that opened a
floodgate of support from what should have been hostile fans.
</P>
<P>
   They stood and cheered and stomped on the dugout and would not
stop until McGwire took what may have been the only curtain call by
an opposing player in the 28-year history of Three Rivers. Not that
McGwire wanted to take it. ``I felt uncomfortable,'' he said,
noting that he did not want to ``show up'' the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates, however, talked him into stepping back onto the
field and doffing his cap. When the inning ended and McGwire went
back out to first, he was serenaded by another standing ovation.
This was followed by an exodus by the crowd, despite the tenuous
nature of the Pirates' one-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, they had gotten their money's worth. ``It's a
wonderful thing to see,'' Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa said.
``It shows they appreciate what this guy is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa has seen such things before. He remembered a game in
Tiger Stadium during Vida Blue's remarkable rookie season with
Oakland in 1971, for example. ``The difference is, he's doing it
every day,'' La Russa said of McGwire, ``and that's making it real
special.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's celebrity status got a Pittsburgh seal of approval
before the game when retired Penguins superstar Mario Lemieux came
by to meet him. McGwire responded by giving Lemieux an autographed
bat.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is in the midst of a hot streak that has produced six
home runs in seven games, including one in which he pinch-hit. With
32 games remaining, he seems very likely to break the season record
for home runs of 61, set by Roger Maris in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire does not see himself as a sure thing. ``I'm not
close to it,'' he said of Maris' mark. ``I'm a long way away, and
it's a long season.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire attributed some of his recent success to the fact that
he is ``not thinking as much'' but ``doing a lot of reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   What he is not reacting to is the controversy swirling around
his use of the over-the-counter substance androstenedione, a
nutritional supplement intended to raise levels of the male hormone
testosterone in order to build lean muscle mass and promote
recovery from injury. It is legal in baseball but banned by the
National Football League and the International Olympic Committee
because it is thought to provide an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to waste my breath on it,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Cardinals issued a statement credited both
to the team and to McGwire that said that androstenedione is ``a
natural substance'' that has no ``proven anabolic steroid effect.''
The statement said that it raises a player's testosterone levels
for only one hour and that it is used only to enhance workouts, not
on-the-field performances.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a lack of ``documentary evidence'' of adverse side
effects, ``the Cardinals medical staff cannot object to Mark's
choice to use this legal and over-the-counter supplement,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As is the case at many of McGwire's games, a lot of the pressure
fell on the pitchers, who were booed by the fans almost every time
a pitch was thrown out of the strike zone. The fans were so hungry
to see McGwire succeed Sunday, they even gave him some polite
applause for his double to open the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire refuses to be upset about his walks. His two Sunday gave
him 136 for the year and broke a team record set by Jack Clark in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take pride in walks,'' he said. ``Like my college coach
taught me, a walk is as good as a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's traditional baseball wisdom, and McGwire's season is
anything but traditional. In a normal season, for instance,
McGwire's teammate, Fernando Tatis, might have been in line for
some media attention for his 5-for-5 game, which included a homer.
Instead, all Tatis got was jostling from the media horde that was
scrambling to talk to McGwire, who was standing in the locker stall
next to his.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his hot streak, La Russa still plans to rest McGwire on
Monday afternoon when the Cardinals close out their three-game
series with the Pirates, winners of nine of their last 11 games.
McGwire will, however, take batting practice and will be available
to pinch-hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the fans might be disappointed,'' La Russa said,
``but it's never difficult to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire seemed pleased to be getting the day off. He has only
one more scheduled day off the rest of the season. The one-day
vacation and his 53rd homer had him beaming and relaxed during his
post-game news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a game,'' he said. ``I'm playing a game I've played
since I was 9 years old. That's how I look at it.''

By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question, after this past week, is no longer if.
</P>
<P>
   It's when. And who. And how far is the record-breaking home-run
ball going to travel.
</P>
<P>
   The storybook weeks of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have thrust
baseball's best adventure back onto the front pages again. The
game's most hallowed record is about to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both have a good chance,'' said a man in the Rangers'
clubhouse who knows what record-teasing is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, how close to the plate will the pitchers throw
to them in the last month of the season?'' Juan Gonzalez asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' right fielder's three-month flirtation with Hack
Wilson's record of 190 runs batted in is no longer an issue on the
sports pages. Pitchers took notice. Opportunities seemed to vanish
for a week. Then Gonzalez got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   History doesn't wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stay hot,'' Gonzalez said. ``They're both hot
right now. But the thing is, you have to ``stay'' hot.''
</P>
<P>
   After these past five days, McGwire and Sosa are officially ``en
fuego.''. Hard hats are advised in area bleachers. Hail-sized
baseballs are being reported throughout the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, however, Wheaties might not be calling the two
sluggers. Their champion breakfast is called Creatine. And, in
McGwire's case, the pregame snack of choice is Androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone else have a problem with last weekend's wire story?
I sure do.
</P>
<P>
   According to his editor, Associated Press reporter Steve
Wilstein was with a group waiting at McGwire's locker. ``He didn't
touch anything,'' the editor said. But Wilstein ``wrote down only
what he saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop right there. If Wilstein comes to your house, does he have
free rein to look inside your medicine cabinets?
</P>
<P>
   It's rude. It's unprofessional.
</P>
<P>
   What if McGwire had an opened fan letter from a _ how shall I
put this? _ more-than-zealous female fan? Would it be OK to print
excerpts from that?
</P>
<P>
   Let's not stop there. Let's let the fans know the entire story.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark _ boxers or briefs?
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland _ spray deodorant or roll-on guy?
</P>
<P>
   But I digress. We're supposed to be talking about home runs
here.
</P>
<P>
   And that's my point. McGwire and Sosa roundly deserve their
upcoming month in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to take anything away from either of them, but I think
Sammy may have a better chance,'' said shortstop Royce Clayton, who
was a St. Louis teammate of McGwire for the first 40 of his homers.
``For one, Sammy is a bad-ball hitter and, two, they can't walk
him. The guy steals over 30 bases a year. You have to factor that
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with the guys hitting behind Mark, but
teams are just going to walk him an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton and Gonzalez concede that Sosa has one other edge going
for him: Wrigley Field's legendary friendly confines. An auspicious
September wind could blow a Sosa pop-up or two _ or 10 _ into the
basket above the Wrigley ivy.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Wrigley Field to Gonzalez, and a starry look comes to
his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're talking,'' he said. Gonzalez's lack of affection
for The Ballpark's spacious left-field dimensions are a matter of
local record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too big here,'' he said with a wistful shake of the head.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' Sosa, therefore, has the edge in ballparks. The
Cardinals' McGwire has the edge in ... muscles. Bat speed. Raw
home-run power.
</P>
<P>
   And here we are talking about Androstenedione again.
</P>
<P>
   The stories over the weekend about McGwire's choice of ``diet
supplements'' had a dark edge to them. But in truth, the whole
issue of over-the-counter supplements is shrouded in gray.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether Andro, designed to raise levels of male
testosterone, is harmful, because a 1994 act of Congress removed
much of its regulatory control of the diet supplement business. The
Cardinals' medical staff said it has no objections to McGwire using
either Creatine or Andro.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Androstenedione is the substance, banned since
last December, that was found recently in the sample of Olympic
gold-medal shot putter Randy Barnes, who faces a possible lifetime
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not jump to conclusions in the McGwire case. Baseball
and pro basketball don't ban Andro. And nearly every clubhouse and
pro locker room has somebody who has taken Sudafed to relieve some
sort of congestion. Sudafed, also an over-the-counter drug, is on
the International Olympic Committee's banned list.
</P>
<P>
   A stirring _ and probably historic _ September lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion here is that we keep our eyes on the batter's
box. Not somebody's locker.

candidate debate, which she did not participate in. Although Gov.
Benjamin Cayetano of Hawaii, is the latest in an unbroken line of
Democratic governors since Hawaii joined the union in 1959, the

ARAB LEAGUE PROTESTS ATTACKS ON SUDAN, AFGHANISTAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Angered by US strikes on Sudan and
Afghanistan, Islamic leaders Sunday demanded an urgent UN meeting
to protest Washington's ``blatant violation'' of international law.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of increasing tensions with the United States, the
Arab League also called for a UN fact-finding investigation into
the cruise missile attacks and urged the United States to avoid
further attacks. But the league stopped short of asking for any
specific penalties against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan Sunday, a spokesman said the Taliban Islamic
movement had restricted the movements of Osama bin Laden, the
target of the US strikes. In Pakistan, Red Cross workers arrived
after being evacuated from Kabul, the Afghan capital, and Kandahar
``pending a change in the situation,'' a Red Cross official said.
</P>
<P>
   While US public support for the missile strikes last week is
high, officials are watching for reactions in Pakistan and other
countries, where small, hard-line Islamic groups are protesting
against the strikes and appear to be gaining public sympathy. Sudan
Sunday asked Washington for a public apology of the missile strike
on a factory and said it would welcome US inspections of the site
and other alleged chemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, Information Minister Ghazi Salah Din
confirmed that Sudan is recalling its diplomats from Washington
``in retaliation for the US actions.'' But Sudan will not break
relations entirely, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a unified effort to explain the missile strikes and maintain
public support for President Clinton's tougher antiterrorism
policy, a half-dozen national security officials appeared on
television to call the strikes successful. ``There may be future
strikes,'' Defense Secretary William S. Cohen warned on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Although an executive order prohibits US-government-sponsored
assassinations, Cohen added that the United States said ``no one
would weep'' if bin Laden died in a future attack. ``If he is in
the line of fire as such, that's his problem,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent a quiet day on Martha's Vineyard after a turbulent
week that included an admission of an improper sexual relationship
with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and the first
US attack on suspected terrorism sites in two countries
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   New details about the Aug. 7 bombings of US embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania and preparations for Washington's retaliations also
emerged Sunday. Intercepted phone conversations between two of bin
Laden's aides gave the White House convincing evidence in the
bombings, Newsweek reported. The magazine said a confession by a
33-year-old Pakistani suspect also helped build the case.
</P>
<P>
   General Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said the United States had good information that the bombings in
Africa ``might be only the first two of three and possibly four
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Clinton's harshest critics Sunday endorsed the US
military action. ``I think the president did exactly the right
thing,'' Representative Porter Goss, a Florida Republican who is
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ``Fox News
Sunday.''

MOVIE THEATERS CASHING IN ON POPCORN   AND OTHER SNACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Forget ``Titanic,'' ``Armageddon'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn, Milk Duds and Cokes are Hollywood's blockbuster hits.
</P>
<P>
   Snack bars are the theater industry's economic engine,
generating profits of 80 to 90 cents for every $1 spent.
</P>
<P>
   Theater operators unapologetically charge $10 for a bag of
popcorn, a candy bar and a soda, knowing that customers won't
complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a captive audience and you're stuck with the
choices, just like at an airport,'' said restaurant consultant
Janet Lowder.
</P>
<P>
   How important is the snack bar?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's the source of nearly $3 billion in annual revenues
for theater chains and is growing: Analysts estimate that snack-bar
spending per patron grew by 5 percent last year, outstripping
attendance growth of 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the movie business is that concessions are where
exhibitors make their money,'' said Kevin Skislock, an analyst with
LH Friend, Weinress, Frankson &AMP; Presson.
</P>
<P>
   Skislock estimates that AMC Entertainment, for example,
generated 84.5 percent profit margins on concessions in its most
recent quarter, compared to 45 percent margins at the box office.
``Maybe Hollywood looks down its nose at popping popcorn, but
that's where the money's made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For customers, popcorn is the food most closely associated with
movies. For theater owners, the economics of popcorn probably make
it their favorite too. A 50-pound bag of popcorn that costs $7.50
wholesale will produce $500 worth of popcorn at the concession
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people, a movie is just not a movie without
popcorn,'' said Gordon Hodge, an entertainment analyst with
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Soft drinks, an area dominated by Coca-Cola, are the second
largest revenue generator, helped by the ubiquitous cup holders now
built into most theater seats. Third place goes to candy, where
Milk Duds, Reese's Pieces and Raisinets duel for supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those staples generating a healthy profit, theater
owners aren't standing pat. Nachos, for example, have gone from
unknown ethnic food to multiplex regular in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now theater owners are selling items like gourmet hot dogs,
chicken wings, pizzas, specialty coffees and garlic pretzels _ all
at inflated prices _ to tempt more and more moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's tough for new entries to break through, particularly
if they require extra staff time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals of selling popcorn, sodas and candy haven't
really changed much because speed at the concession line is king,''
said Michael Rosenberg, president of Promotion in Motion, a New
Jersey-based supplier. ``You're not going to find chicken wings
becoming a standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Cohen, marketing executive with Los Angeles-based Pacific
Theaters, agrees. ``The primary candies are pretty consistent _
Milk Duds, Red Vines, Raisinets,'' she said. ``We have the 80-20
rule, which means that 80 percent of your sales in candy come from
20 percent of your products.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the occasional moviegoer who sneaks food in, most
patrons accept the premium prices without complaint.
</P>
<P>
   AMC, which generally discounts prices to slightly below average
in its markets, has seen snack-bar spending per visit jump by 12
percent over the last two years to $1.97.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the discounting, AMC's snack-bar margins are in the 82
to 85 percent range, analysts estimate. That's a few percentage
points lower than the returns at Regal and Carmike.
</P>
<P>
   How do theater operators manage to ring up profits better than
virtually any other major business? There are seven key factors:
</P>
<P>
   --The need to snack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a crossover from watching television, where they
can't just sit down in front of a screen without having something
in hand,'' said Sherdian Warrick, food and nutrition editor at
Health magazine. ``There has to be something else going on.''
</P>
<P>
   --Faster lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``With movies at megaplexes starting every 20 minutes, the
theater can fully staff the stands and keep lines shorter,''
Skislock noted. ``If there are 10 people in a line and your movie's
going to start soon, you can't be bothered; but if there's only two
or three people, it's much easier to buy what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   --Bulk candy, which is sold from self-service bins for $6 to $7
a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea caught on pretty quickly,'' said Scott Samet,
co-founder of Los Angeles-based Taste of Nature, which ships more
than 1 million pounds of candy annually to theater chains. ``Once
the numbers got analyzed, the circuits realized there was serious
money to be made in bulk. Since it's self-service, people's eyes
are usually bigger than their stomachs.''
</P>
<P>
   (2nd take to follow)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Marketing tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer giants such as Nestle, Coca-Cola and Hershey are tying
their products to the big summer movies, generating more excitement
for the movies and the products behind the concession stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though `Godzilla' didn't live up to expectations at the
box office, our campaign on the movie went very well,'' said
Hershey spokesman Mike Kinney. ``We're definitely going to do
more.''
</P>
<P>
   --The megaplex phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come to megaplexes, they have heightened
expectations and they tend to spend more time at the location,''
Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   --More, more, more.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, theater staffs have developed the technique of
``upselling,'' or convincing patrons to buy larger sizes of popcorn
and drinks for a discount. Kathy Warning, UA's director of food
services, says she recommends trying to upsell to about half the
customers.
</P>
<P>
   --Attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Americans aren't particularly concerned about healthy eating and
tend to ignore warnings about the treats at the movie snack bar.
``People are just getting fatter and fatter,'' said Jane Hurley, a
senior nutritionist at the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners say such criticism isn't merited since they are
simply delivering what their customers want.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a health-food store and we never claimed to be,''
said Mark Pascucci, a Loews Cineplex Entertainment vice president.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, chains are scrambling for the magic solution
to make themselves stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that chains are looking hard at bumping up the
quality of snacks as a way to differentiate themselves,'' said
Ginger Wilson, vice president of marketing at Pasadena,
Calif.-based Wetzel's Pretzels, now in 50 theaters after less than
a year of trying to crack the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Regal chain has opened Funscape complexes containing bowling
alleys, miniature golf and bumper cars; Loews Cineplex has
developed items cooked at the concession stand such as curly fries,
pizzas and chicken tenders, and is ramping up offerings of
speciality coffees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried coffee five years ago but we did it with fancy
machines that no one could work,'' Pascucci said. ``But with the
boom in coffee bars, we're going to try again. People have been
asking for it for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a move that could signal a major turn toward upscale
moviegoing, General Cinemas opened Premium Cinema four months ago
in a Chicago suburb. The idea was to give customers willing to pay
$15 rather than the regular $7.50 enough extra flourishes to turn
them into repeat customers.
</P>
<P>
   For the extra cash, Premium customers get access to a 70-seat
auditorium next to the company's ``standard'' 18-plex. The
auditorium has a separate entrance, valet parking, concierge
service and a bistro-type restaurant. The theater itself has
leather seats and tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Hollywood studio screening room,'' said Brian
Callaghan, a spokesman for General.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said General will have several more Premium Cinemas
open by the end of next year. ``People are asking us why didn't
someone think of this before,'' he said. ``We have a lot of people
who come out every time we change the movie.''

PHONE WORKERS IN CONNECTICUT BEGIN A STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of workers from Southern New England Telecommunications
Corp. walked picket lines Sunday as customers braced for possible
service delays on the first day of a strike that began just after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone company and Local 1298 of the Connecticut Union of
Telephone Workers and Communications Workers of America, which
represents the striking workers, did not negotiate Sunday, but each
side expressed eagerness to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get down to doing what we have to do so people can get
back to work here,'' said Jim Grinberg, a spokesman for the union.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the phone company, Kevin Moore, said he expected
the federal mediator who has been overseeing the negotiations to
advise the company of a new schedule for talks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said ``the vast majority'' of the company's 3,600
management workers had been called in to replace the 6,300 striking
operators, customer service representatives and technicians.
Nevertheless, he said, customers would probably face delays in
reaching operators and having new service installed. The company
provides phone service to nearly 3 million Connecticut customers.
</P>
<P>
   The union called the strike at 12:01 a.m. Sunday after the two
sides failed to reach an agreement in negotiations. The telephone
company and union negotiators had reached a tentative agreement on
Aug. 7, but talks were reopened under the federal mediator, Tom
Carroll, after the proposal met resistance from rank-and-file union
members who said the contract did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   They want the phone company to eliminate its two-tier wage
structure, in which workers doing the same job are paid different
wages, and to provide salary parity with telephone workers in other
states, whom the union contends are paid 20 percent to 25 percent
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to be paid as well as people across the country
for the same jobs,'' Grinberg said. ``We live in one of the most
expensive states in the Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the company had thought negotiations were progressing
on Saturday. ``Until the end of the workday, we were fairly
confident in reaching an amicable settlement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, union workers were manning picket lines at SNET
locations in New Haven, Hartford, Stratford, Meriden and other
Connecticut cities. The Associated Press reported that one picketer
in Stratford suffered minor injuries when he was struck by a car,
and that one person was arrested. It was not clear whether the
incident was related to the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The last strike against SNET, in 1986, lasted eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, 73,000 Bell Atlantic workers went on strike
for two days before negotiators agreed on a two-year contract
guaranteeing that jobs in the company's high-technology growth
areas will go to union employees. Bell Atlantic also agreed to
phase out a nonunion customer service operation in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The communications workers union is also on strike against
another regional Bell company, U S West, which is based in Denver
and provides telephone service to 25 million customers in 14
states.

ROBINSON OUTLASTS GATTI FOR SPLIT DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During an eight-month layoff, Arturo Gatti changed trainers,
changed training strategies and even changed his hair color. But
when he stepped into the ring against Ivan Robinson at the Atlantic
City Convention Center late Saturday night, nothing had changed
about his style.
</P>
<P>
   In what has now become a familiar scene, Gatti absorbed punches,
dished out punishment and looked on the verge of being knocked out,
only to rally at the end of each grueling round. But Robinson
mirrored the indefatigable Gatti, and in the end it was he who
benefited from the exchanges as he scored a 10-round split decision
in their lightweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a warrior,'' said Robinson (26-2). ``I don't take nothing
from any fighter. I was hurt, but I had to keep coming.''
</P>
<P>
   One judge, Ed Leahy, scored the bout 96-93 for Gatti (29-3). But
Steven Weisfeld scored it 96-94 for Robinson and Melvina Latham
scored it 98-93 for Robinson. Both Weisfeld and Latham gave
Robinson rounds five through nine, while Leahy gave Gatti every
round from the third through the 10th except the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   According to Compubox statistics, Gatti threw 835 punches to
Robinson's 795, but Gatti landed only 274, or not quite a third;
Robinson landed 400, just over half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gatti is like a stick of dynamite,'' Robinson said. ``You
light that fuse and you don't know when he's going off.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatti scored the only knockdown of the fight when he caught an
off-balance Robinson with a right to the side of the head in the
fourth round. After a particularly brutal sixth round, the two
fighters stood smiling at each other after the bell, seeming to
indicate that they were enjoying the mutual mauling.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti received a small cut underneath his left eye in the third
round, though it was not as severe as the cut he sustained over his
left eye in his fight against Angel Manfredy eight months ago.
Gatti did not attend the postfight news conference. Robinson's only
cut came after the fight, when one of his cornermen jabbed him in
the hand with scissors while removing tape.
</P>
<P>
   Going against conventional wisdom, Robinson took the fight right
to Gatti. Gatti also put tremendous pressure on Robinson, but
Robinson stood his ground. In the 10th round, Robinson took some
heavy shots and looked out on his feet, but he would not go down.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the fight, the promoter, Dino Duva of Main
Events, and Lou DiBella, senior vice president of programing for
HBO, were talking about a rematch. But it will be a while before
Gatti steps into the ring. A victory would have put him in line for
a shot at Cesar Bazan, the World Boxing Council lightweight
champion. That plan has been scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Robinson, who lost during the American trials
for the 1992 Olympic Games at Barcelona, has opened up a world of
possibilities. There was some talk of matching him with Manfredy,
who stopped Gatti on cuts in the eighth round of their January
fight. Robinson lost to Phillip Holiday in his only title shot in
1996 and wants another chance. He would like to fight Shane Mosley,
the reigning International Boxing Federation lightweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read something in the newspaper that said Shane is such a
powerhouse,'' Robinson said. ``Come on. Shane ain't that much
better than Gatti.''

COMMENTARY: FILLING THE IDEA VACUUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 10:45 a.m. Sunday, Mark Green was back on the
steps of City Hall, this time releasing a report on the failures of
state nursing homes. The news conference over, Green, a Democratic
candidate for U.S. Senate, rested a sneaker against a railing and
took stock of his Sunday morning. ``Five cameras,'' he said,
gleaming, before bouncing into a car and heading for the first of
two streets fairs.
</P>
<P>
   And this was a light day.
</P>
<P>
   Green _ short on cash, little known outside New York City, and
widely viewed in political circles as the least likely of the three
Democrats to win the Sept. 15 primary _ is campaigning relentlessly
these days: offering up speeches, attacks and proposals, trying to
nudge his opponents into acknowledging his existence. This week,
Green, who can be glib, is running through his ``Twenty-one ideas
for the 21st Century'' (two down and 19 to go as of Sunday night).
</P>
<P>
   Whether all this exertion will turn Green from the New York City
public advocate into the Democratic challenger to Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato is debatable; there is reason to suspect that Green's
frantic schedule is equally intended to position him for the 2001
mayoral race.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the case, it is becoming clear that Green _ more
than either rival, Geraldine Ferraro or Charles Schumer _ is the
Democrat who is largely defining the day-to-day course of this
closely watched New York primary.
</P>
<P>
   Green's call last week for a $100 billion Pentagon spending cut
made more of a splash than anything either of his two major rivals
have proposed. As late as Sunday afternoon, Ferraro's
communications director, Stephen Gaskill, was still responding to
it, warning that Green's proposal could endanger the nation's
security. On Friday, Green called for federal support of health
insurance premiums for people who are between jobs. Idea No. 3
comes Monday: health insurance for all the nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   It was Green's needling of Schumer at a candidates' debate that
provoked the exchange between the two men that won all the
headlines. And it was no surprise that after a contentious
television interview that was broadcast Sunday, Ferraro
sarcastically accused her interviewer, Marcia Kramer of WCBS-TV, of
doing the ``Green spin'' after Ms. Kramer pushed Ferraro about why
she had agreed to so few debates. Green has raised the same
question.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most people would agree that it is a good thing when
politicians use campaigns to talk about ideas. That said, Green is
doing this because he has to. As Green likes to say, he does not
have the money of Schumer, who is waging an expensive campaign of
television advertisements, or the celebrity and historic political
base of Ferraro. And if Green has proved himself expert at anything
in his career, it is getting his face on television.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that he is unlikely to win, Green can risk talking
about military cuts and increasing social spending. Those are the
kinds of ideas that can win Green attention and Democratic primary
voters _ but it is also the kind of talk that will gladden D'Amato,
a Republican who has made a habit of attacking his opponents as
liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro and Schumer are running very different _ as in less
adventurous _ campaigns. That is particularly true with Ferraro,
who has accepted the conventional political wisdom that she is the
front-runner, and not risked anything that might upset that. While
Green talks about defense spending, Ferraro shakes hands at subway
stations, not the kind of public appearances that allow for a
rigorous discussion of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has a more active public schedule, and has proposed a
series of ideas that have captured voters' attention, such as
making college tuition tax deductible and allowing teachers to pay
off student loans by working in public schools, while invoking his
legislative record as a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's ideas, if substantive, are not necessarily risky: On
Friday, for example, Schumer talked about high college tuition (he
is against it).
</P>
<P>
   Green's opponents are reacting to his sallies with a kind of
worried disdain. ``Mark Green has a mean streak, and he's trying to
do whatever he can to draw attention to his campaign _ which hasn't
caught on with the voters,'' said Gaskill of the Ferraro campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The point might be correct. But Green is also filling a vacuum.
He is, by his very action, demonstrating his opponents' inaction,
and to some extent, forcing them to talk about issues they might
prefer to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   And win or lose, that might end up being Green's real legacy to
this contest.

POSSIBLE WITNESS IN WOMAN'S DISAPPEARANCE QUESTIONED IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A monthlong search for a possible witness in the
disappearance of an Upper East Side millionaire ended early
Saturday when New York City detectives flew to a small Florida
farming town to question him, the police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was questioned, Jose Antonio Alvarez, 24, had
traveled to New York from Florida in June with Sante and Kenneth
Kimes, a mother and son, who are the primary suspects in the
disappearance of Irene Silverman, an 82-year-old widow who vanished
on July 5 and is presumed dead. Alvarez was seen at Mrs.
Silverman's mansion in the days before her disappearance, but then
had disappeared himself.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he resurfaced in Belle Glade, Fla., where he was
living with his parents and working construction jobs. He was
apparently unaware that he was wanted for questioning in New York
and in Manalapan, Fla., where the authorities believe he may have
been with the Kimeses when they used bad checks to purchase an
$80,000 mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Angelo Tsaousis of the Belle Glade Police Department
said he waited with Alvarez while New York detectives flew to Palm
Beach and then drove to Belle Glade, where they arrived and began
questioning Alvarez just before 1 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tsaousis said he did not know what the detectives learned, but
said he believed that they had returned to New York, and Alvarez to
his home, later that morning. The New York City police would not
comment Sunday night on the results of their interview with
Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by telephone on WNBC-TV on Saturday night, Alvarez
denied any involvement in Mrs. Silverman's disappearance. The
station quoted him as saying that the Kimeses had hired him as
their handyman at their rental house at the Palm Beach Polo Club,
and then took him along to New York.
</P>
<P>
   He left a week before Mrs. Silverman's disappearance, the
station said, because he found the Kimeses ``strange.'' Alvarez
could not be reached for comment Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses are being held in New York on charges of credit card
fraud and passing a bad check in Utah to buy a Lincoln Town Car.

VALLONE IS FIRST AMONG DEMOCRATIC RIVALS TO BEGIN A MAJOR TV AD
CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Barely three weeks before the primary, Peter
Vallone on Monday will become the first of the four Democrats
running for governor to embark on a major television advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, say that
the campaign will spend almost $700,000 over the next week to 10
days _ a sizable effort, by any standard _ to broadcast two
30-second spots in every major market in the state and in most
minor ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the nature and timing of the ads underscore how hard it will
be for any of the Democrats to unseat the popular Republican
incumbent, George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's ads are of the getting-to-know-you variety, intended,
as much as anything else, to introduce him to an electorate that,
fairly late in the game, still knows little about the contenders
and has yet to devote much attention to this race.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who has raised far more money than all the Democrats
combined, has had ads on television since June, and he still has
well over $12 million in his campaign treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's new television effort puts him on a pace to spend
nearly all of his remaining $2 million by the Sept. 15 primary,
leaving him, if he wins, to start fund raising from scratch for the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to stay on the air through the primary,'' said
Kevin McCabe, Vallone's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's chief rival for the nomination, Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross, who reported having slightly more money on hand in
mid-August than he did, has so far held her fire, spending a little
money on radio ads and none on television. Nearly all her campaign
money has come from her husband, the financier Wilbur Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign spokesman, Kevin Davitt, would not disclose when
she might take to the airwaves more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates, Charles Hynes, the Brooklyn district
attorney, and James Larocca, a former state transportation
commissioner, trail in the polls and have too little money for
large-scale advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion surveys show that Ms. McCaughey Ross, a former
Republican who was once Pataki's protege, is by far the best-known
of the Democrats in the field, but she is also the only one viewed
negatively by large numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic strategists had predicted that she would be the
first to do large-scale advertising, either to combat the
reputation for erratic behavior that she gained in a long-running
feud with Pataki, or to attack Vallone.

OLD SHIP FINDS A NEW LIFE AS A SYMBOL OF REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLEN COVE, N.Y. _ Days away from being scuttled at sea, the
Regina Maris, a 90-year-old three-masted barkentine that smuggled
Jewish refugees out of Nazi Germany during World War II, has found
a new home here in Hempstead Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   As if emerging from Glen Cove's rich maritime past, the tall
wooden ship is scheduled to arrive here Tuesday morning when she
will be welcomed by Mayor Thomas Suozzi and other city officials,
who plan to make her a star attraction and a symbol of their $220
million waterfront revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   For the last eight years, the rakish prow and 108-foot-high
masts of the Regina Maris have dominated the waterfront of
Greenport, a village about 90 nautical miles east of Glen Cove at
the eastern end of Long Island, where a group of elderly seamen,
all members of Save the Regina Maris Ltd., have labored to keep the
ship afloat, despite her aging timbers and rigging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry to see her go, but we feel we can no longer afford
to keep her here,'' said David Kapell, the mayor of Greenport, who
estimated that it could take $1 million to $5 million to rebuild
the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Regina Maris has long been a part of our community,'' he
said, ``but we have had to come to grips with the fact that the
project to save and restore her was more than we could handle. We
wish Glen Cove well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 239-ton vessel, built in 1908 in Svendborg, Denmark, has had
a storied history, much of it passed down by word of mouth,
according to Merlon Wiggin, executive director of the East End
Seaport Museum and Marine Foundation and president of Save the
Regina Maris.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was a Baltic and North Atlantic trader in the early
days, he said, a transporter of Jewish refugees from European ports
during World War II, a refitted private yacht after the war and,
later, a research vessel that charted the migratory habits of the
humpback whale.
</P>
<P>
   The aging ship fell on hard times in 1988 in Boston Harbor, when
she sank after a bilge pump failed. She was refloated, only to be
scuttled in 1991 to protect her from Hurricane Bob. Later that
year, she was secured by Wiggin and his committee and towed to
Greenport. She was to have been scuttled for a second and final
time later this month when her maritime insurance ran out, but Glen
Cove came to her rescue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The committee will retain an interest in the vessel, but the
majority of a new board of directors will be appointed by Suozzi.
</P>
<P>
   Suozzi said that the Regina Maris, which is Latin for ``Queen of
the Sea,'' would be leaving Greenport late Sunday night and that
she would be towed at a speed of three knots by a tug from Barker
Marine Services of Port Washington, which has agreed to do it at
cost for $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 hours under tow, she is expected to arrive in Glen Cove
and be tied up at Steam Boat Landing, a recently opened waterfront
restaurant that is a part of the city's waterfront revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a plan beyond getting her here, but we're going
to do it anyway,'' Suozzi said. ``Everyone says we're crazy and
that the boat is a mess. But they said the same thing about our
waterfront when we started to clean it up, and so far, we've been
very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the city had raised $20 million in federal and state
restoration funds for the waterfront project, and that an
additional $200 million had been pledged by private investors.
</P>
<P>
   He said Glen Cove planned to clean up polluted sites, improve
the waterfront's infrastructure, build new bulkheads and clear
roads into the area for access to a new hotel, shops and high-speed
ferry service to Manhattan and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had already raised more than $20,000 for the
ship's repairs from two donors, more than enough to pay the ship's
annual $5,000 insurance premium. Two business groups in Denmark
have also expressed an interest in helping to rebuild the vessel,
he said.
</P>

   ``Many people said it couldn't be done, but we're doing it,''
Suozzi said. ``And we'll do the same with the Regina Maris.'' He
noted that Glen Cove was also home to the Nassau County Holocaust
Memorial and Education Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard they were going to scuttle the Regina Maris and
that she had this incredible history,'' he said, ``we had to save
her and make her feel at home here.''

GORDON GETS ON KEY LIST AFTER LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn. )  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ Jeff Gordon became the seventh driver to find
out just how hard it is to win five straight Winston Cup races,
finishing fifth on Saturday in his bid to make history in the
Goody's Headache Powder 500.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting his car and a cold, Gordon never led a lap at Bristol
Motor Speedway in his pursuit of a fifth straight victory, which
would have set a modern record.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon joined some exclusive company _ Mark Martin, Bill
Elliott, Harry Gant, Dale Earnhardt, Darrell Waltrip, Cale
Yarborough _ as drivers to get stuck on four straight victories.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the defending Winston Cup champion, also lost valuable
points to the race winner, Martin, in the points standing. Gordon
now leads Martin by just 67 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got fifth,'' said an exasperated Gordon after the race.
``Does that count for anything?''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon added: ``This is one of the toughest places to get
around. I was just trying to make 500 laps. This is a demanding
place, and it takes a lot of a driver, especially when the car is
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Saturday night's race, Gordon had won four times on
the half-mile oval at Bristol, including a race here earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
   All of his victories, however, have come in the daytime race. He
still has never won here under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 10 years since both the day and night races at
Bristol were won by the same driver in the same season. (Dale
Earnhardt swept both races in 1987.)
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent early in Saturday's race that Gordon's car was
not good enough to win a fifth straight time.
</P>
<P>
   By lap 30 of 500, Gordon had moved up to fifth, but as his car's
handling problems worsened, he began to fall back in position.
</P>
<P>
   By lap 200, however, Gordon began taking back some of those
spots he lost, moving up to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just off a little bit here at nighttime,'' said Gordon,
who failed to lead a lap for the first time in 14 straight races.
``We've got to work on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon began his streak of four consecutive victories last month
at Pocono. He won again less than a week later at Indianapolis,
where he took home a $1.6 million purse, the largest in U.S.
motorsports history. Gordon went on to victories at Watkins Glen,
N.Y., and at Michigan two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't matter to me,'' Gordon said of the record.
``I would have liked to win. But to come in the top five, that's
all I could ask for. We did exactly what we needed to do as far as
the championship.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gordon cited his starting positions the previous four races as a
major factor in his success.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he started seventh, the worst spot since the streak
began. During the streak, Gordon had started on the pole once, the
outside of the front row once, from the third position twice.
</P>
<P>
   Severe handling problems on Saturday did not allow him to drive
his way to the front of the field.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointed looks on the faces in Gordon's pit after the
race were a stark contrast to the celebration in front of the pit
stall of Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after losing his father, stepmother and stepsister in
a private plane crash, Martin choked back the tears as he took a
fifth checkered flag this season, pulling closer to Gordon in the
championship points standing.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton finished second and the pole-sitter Rusty Wallace
was third.
</P>
<P>
   ``This helps me because I was so devastated,'' said Martin, who
led twice for 190 laps, running up front for the last 181. ``Now
it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 24 races at Bristol, Martin, driver of the No. 6 Valvoline
Ford, has scored 17 top-0 finishes, including nine straight.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night marked Martin's 18th top-10 finish this season,
which is more than any other driver. He has finished in the top 10
in each of the last 13 races, which includes 11 top-five finishes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PIT STOPS:
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield, who finished eighth on Saturday, has gone from
36 points ahead in the championship points standing to a 518-point
deficit since his first career victory at Pocono in June.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, when the NASCAR Winston Cup visits New Hampshire for
the second time this season, Saturday night's runner-up, Jeff
Burton, will be looking to win his third in four races there. He
won both the 1997 and 1998 Jiffy Lube 300 at Loudon.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt, who finished sixth on Saturday after leading
midway through the race, has just one victory in his last 81
starts. It came this season at the Daytona 500.

MAN ARRESTED FOR SELLING ART WITHOUT CITY PERMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than two weeks after a judge ruled that the city
cannot prevent vendors from peddling art without a permit, Parks
Department enforcement officers on Sunday arrested a 47-year-old
Tarrytown man for selling paintings without a city permit in front
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Similar charges against three artists arrested in the spring
were dismissed earlier this month by Judge Lucy Billings of State
Criminal Court. In her ruling, the judge said art should be
regarded as a form of free speech and accorded the same
constitutional protection as spoken and written matter.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, officers arrested Patrick Christiano for
selling paintings and poetry without a permit, said Edward Skyler,
a Parks Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Another artist, Sue Walters Balmuth, said Christiano was one of
the three artists whose cases were dismissed by Judge Billings.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's incident began when Christiano was issued a summons for
violating the city's permit policy. He returned a half-hour later,
began selling again, was issued another summons, and refused to
leave. He was charged with failing to comply with Parks Department
orders, Skyler said.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing Judge Billings' ruling, Skyler argued Sunday that the
judge had no authority over the agency's ability to enforce its
regulations. He repeatedly cited the orders of a federal court
judge in Manhattan who ruled earlier this year that the city had
not violated the First Amendment by limiting the number of artists
who could sell their works in parks or on adjacent sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Under a policy that went into effect in March, the city issues
permits to artists who sell their works in these areas; 24 are
issued every month for the two wide sections of sidewalk on Fifth
Avenue in front of the Metropolitan, for a $25 fee.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations sparked raucous protests in front of the museum
in the spring, with artists displaying banners lampooning Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani as Hitler. Weekend after weekend, Parks
enforcement officers arrested the protesters, seized their artwork
and issued fines as high as $1,000.

APOLLO THEATER WORKERS SAY THEY WILL JOIN UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying they have endured poor working conditions for
years, stagehands at the financially troubled Apollo Theater
announced Sunday that they were joining a union in hopes of getting
health benefits, retirement funds and higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   The organizing effort comes as the state attorney general's
office is investigating the financial relationship between the
private foundation that runs the theater and a broadcasting company
that tapes television shows there. Members of the stage crew said
Sunday that their complaints were a completely separate issue. But
they chose to organize while the theater was under investigation in
hopes of drawing more attention to their cause, said Joseph Gray, a
senior stagehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that because of the investigation, our plight would
be in the spotlight a little more,'' said Gray, who said he has
worked at the Apollo for 10 years without health benefits or a
pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   The stagehands went even further in their publicity strategy,
hiring a press agent to reach out to a reporter, designating three
senior stagehands to give interviews and asking the reporter to
delay contacting the theater management until Sunday night, when
they finally informed the management of their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said all 34 members of the theater's stage crew signed up
last week for membership in Local No. 1 of the International
Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 2,150
stagehands in New York City. James Claffey Jr., the theater
business manager of Local No. 1, said as many as 300 union members
would wave signs and distribute informational fliers Monday in
front of the historic theater, on 125th Street in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Blake, the executive director of the Apollo Theater
Foundation, said Sunday that she could not comment because she had
not yet heard the details of the organizing effort. Christopher
McKenna, a spokesman for Attorney General Dennis Vacco, also
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit foundation runs the Apollo Theater for the state,
which owns it. But the theater has fallen into disrepair in recent
years, and state officials announced in May that they would
withhold $750,000 in loans and grants from the foundation until
questions about its finances had been answered.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, state officials are questioning whether the
foundation's board allowed a company, Inner City Broadcasting, to
significantly underpay the foundation for use of the Apollo and its
name in taping a popular television show there. The company
retained the theater under a five-year licensing agreement.
U.S.Rep. Charles Rangel, the chairman of the foundation's board, is
close friends with Percy Sutton, the owner of Inner City
Broadcasting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the licensing agreement, Inner City was supposed to pay
the foundation $2,000 per taping or 25 percent of the show's
profits, whichever was greater. But state officials say the
foundation's executives told its board early this year that Sutton
owed at least $3 million under the agreement, which expired at the
end of last year. When the board pressed for payment, it received
only $200,000, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton and Rangel both say the foundation received all that it
had been owed. But James Claffey Jr., theater business manager of
Local No. 1, who is leading the organizing effort, said the charges
of financial mismanagement made the union especially eager to help
organize the Apollo stagehands. He said the Apollo stagehands made
between $15 and $20 an hour, while unionized stagehands in New York
made between $25 and $38. The Apollo stagehands _ who are in charge
of lighting, sound and set production _ work at the theater part
time, because the theater usually puts on only one or two shows a
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo stagehands said they were also seeking better working
conditions and scheduled lunch hours. They will be sworn in as
members of Local No. 1 next month, Claffey said. If the Apollo
management does not agree to negotiate a contract, the union will
file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Dessisso, an Apollo stagehand, said he liked working at
the theater but was not making enough to support his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going after them with any vengeful reasons,'' he
said. ``This is just business.''

EDITORIAL: NO TIME TO GO SOFT ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 24:
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate aftermath of U.S. missile attacks against
suspected terrorists in Afghanistan and Sudan, the Clinton
administration understandably needs to be cautious about
threatening the use of force elsewhere. But Washington cannot
afford to slacken the pressure on Iraq for long. Now that Saddam
Hussein has disabled the international inspection system designed
to prevent him from building biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons, he may quickly be able to produce enough germ agents to
menace his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Washington has been
firmly committed to keeping Baghdad from ever again building mass
destruction weapons. But with international support for arms
inspections and sanctions against Iraq weakening, some
administration officials seem ready to quietly abandon that goal.
Instead, they would concentrate U.S. efforts on stopping Baghdad
from ever using such terror weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Switching from prevention to containment would be a grave error.
The administration should not imagine that Iraq will become any
more tractable, or the U.N. Security Council any more united, if
the United States ceases to enforce inspections. Washington should
fully back the arms inspectors when they try to resume work. Only
unflinching U.S. determination can keep Baghdad in line and stop
less resolute Security Council members from bending to Iraqi
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's real grievance against the U.N. inspectors is that they
threaten his goal of secretly preserving elements of his germ
warfare, nerve gas and nearly completed nuclear weapons programs.
That is why he repeatedly obstructs their work. The closer the
inspectors come to Saddam's most sensitive secrets _ documents
describing stocks of deadly anthrax and botulinum toxin, physical
evidence that VX nerve gas was loaded onto missiles _ the more
inventive he becomes in devising reasons to hold them at bay.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam now gets away with vitiating the U.N. inspection
system, Iraq's concealed weapons programs will give it a big head
start on rebuilding its arsenal of terror.

EDITORIAL: SENATOR D'AMATO'S CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Most elected politicians love to complain about having to hit up
campaign donors, but not Alfonse D'Amato, one of the Senate's
happiest fund-raisers. Two years ago, he hauled in $24 million for
Senate Republicans, much of it from banks and financial
institutions overseen by the committee he leads. For his
re-election drive this year, he has already harvested $20 million.
A less likely supporter of campaign finance reform might be hard to
imagine.
</P>
<P>
   But today we challenge that assumption. D'Amato is a flexible
man in a tough re-election fight who has spent years in the belly
of the fund-raising beast. Voters will be watching to see if he
seizes the opportunity on one of the most important votes of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate returns to Washington in a week, campaign
finance reform will be one of the first orders of business. Fresh
from winning approval in the House, where 61 Republicans defied
their leadership to support reform, the Shays-Meehan ``soft money''
ban is to be introduced as an amendment to various other bills.
Earlier this year, 52 senators voted for reform, including seven
Republicans. But eight more Republicans are needed to break what is
certain to be a filibuster mounted by Trent Lott, the majority
leader, and Mitch McConnell, D'Amato's successor as chief
fund-raiser for the Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A courageous shift by the senator from New York could by itself
break things open. Long shot though it seems, some Republicans in
the Senate who favor reform do not rule out a shift by D'Amato,
once he realizes that his own re-election may hinge on his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   After the scandals surrounding President Clinton's re-election
campaign, there was a tendency among Republicans to declare that
only Democrats engaged in abuses. But Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee directed an inquiry last year showing that both parties
had become addicted to soft money, the unrestricted contributions
to party organizations from corporations, unions and rich donors
that were raised to circumvent the limitations on such
contributions to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   After reform was debated in the Senate, D'Amato showed that he
was not entirely unresponsive to voter disgust over the corruption
of campaign contributions. Though he voted against cutting off
debate on the key reform bill, thus burying the chances of Senate
passage for the time being, he declined to vote for a phony
anti-labor alternative measure designed to kill reform entirely
that was pushed by Lott. Feeling more of the heat this summer,
D'Amato told Newsday that he now favored ``some limitation'' on
soft money. He has often complained, moreover, of the unlimited
spending by unions for attack ads against Republican candidates in
the closing days of the last campaign. The campaign reform
legislation would apply strict fund-raising limitations to any such
ads run by unions or other independent groups.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has not only been a prodigious fund-raiser for Senate
Republicans. He also angered many donors to the Senate campaign
fund when they found out he had transferred their contributions
into New York to support the campaign war chest of Gov. George
Pataki, his protege, and the campaigns of three conservative
upstate judges.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato could go a long way toward expunging his unseemly
reputation for raising money and shifting it around by standing up
for reform at its moment of maximum need. This is a senator for
whom elections tend to focus the mind, as seen by his conversions
in the past on environmental and health care issues. We believe his
mind can be focused on campaign finance reform as well.
</P>
<P>
   Of D'Amato, Bob Dole once said that ``Al is so persistent, he
doesn't even take `yes' for an answer.'' That legendary persistence
in the pursuit of electoral victory should lead him to heed the
pleas of the voters to do more than deplore fund-raising excesses.
He can vote for a measure that will revolutionize the system. He
has a chance to emerge as a hero of reform, instead of the guardian
of a system everyone knows is corrupt.

DONALD TRUMP ADMIRER GUILTY OF DEFRAUDING HUNDREDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' California news file.) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Claiming Donald Trump and Mother Teresa as
references, it's no wonder Stephen Murphy had such an easy time
ripping people off.
</P>
<P>
   After federal investigators discovered that the self-proclaimed
homeless-man-turned-millionaire sold interest in buildings and
mini-malls he never purchased, Murphy pleaded guilty to six felony
charges last month and will be sentenced by a judge in November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of mostly elderly investors are marveling at
how easy it was for the social chameleon to take their money.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks, Calif., resident Rudy Kretschec, a 66-year-old
retiree, gave more than $15,000 to Murphy in 1992, hoping to make
money to pass on to his five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't get the feeling it was flim-flam. He was so good at
what he did, believe me, you would invest,'' Kretschec said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   He said Murphy found out about his Korean War experience and
used a ``veterans have to stick together'' approach to lure
investment funds. In Murphy's books, advertisements and television
appearances in the early 1990s, the 49-year-old said he was a
Vietnam veteran who used to live out of his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the American success story,'' Kretschec said.
</P>
<P>
   Kretschec was by no means alone, and Murphy is by no means the
last of the flim-flammers, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment fraud is the wave of the future,'' said FBI Special
Agent Dan Bolick, who specializes in fraud investigation in the Los
Angeles area. ``All of these other (scams) are getting smaller and
the one category that is getting bigger is investment fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy couldn't be reached, but his public defender, Ellen
Barry, pointed out that Murphy had plenty of legitimate business,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually was selling real estate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy owned American Capital Investments Inc., a company
supposedly set up for buying, operating and selling real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Painter said Murphy's first
program, Plaza Del Sol, solicited investments for a shopping center
that was never bought _ a fact that was concealed from investors.
He ended up raising more than $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of Murphy's beach-side Marina Del Rey office were
filled with kudos and accolades, including a picture of Mother
Teresa. Investors said Murphy pointed out a framed letter,
supposedly from Mother Teresa, when making his sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   His book, ``Formerly One Up on Trump,'' includes a complimentary
letter purportedly signed by The Donald himself.
</P>
<P>
   After telling investors that he had resold property at a large
profit, he urged them to ``roll over'' their funds to other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including Kretschec, were given monthly interest payments.
But prosecutors claim those payments came from other investors'
funds, not from ACI properties.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission finally caught up to
Murphy in the summer of 1993, and got a court order to freeze his
assets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Thom Mrozek called Murphy a con
man who will pay for his schemes with a prison term.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an environment with an overheated stock market, these
so-called securities gurus pose a particularly dangerous threat. As
we saw during the S&AMP;L crisis of the 1980s, con men have been
particularly effective in separating investors from their money,''
Mrozek said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Murphy pleaded guilty to five counts of mail fraud and
one count of making false statements to a financial institution,
Painter said. Murphy faces 55 years in prison, although the U.S.
Attorney's Office will recommend five years through a plea
agreement.

EDITORIAL: THE PERIL TO NEW YORK'S PORT

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 24:
</P>
<P>
   The Port of New York and New Jersey's days as the epicenter of
maritime trade on the Eastern Seaboard may be numbered. Halifax,
Nova Scotia, according to a Moody's report, has grabbed about 10
percent of its Midwest-bound cargo business in recent years.
Sea-Land and Maersk, carriers whose leases start expiring next
year, have been shopping for a deepwater port along the Atlantic
Coast this summer. The message delivered by their focus on
alternative ports is louder than a ship's horn. The two states must
drop their rivalry over jobs and develop a joint strategy to ensure
the harbor's future as one of the world's premier ports of call.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will be easy. Dredging for deepwater terminals and
improving rail and truck access will require hundreds of millions
of dollars. The environmental obstacles will be challenging as
well. But these costs will be far lower than the price of
vacillation. Why stunt the potential of a port that generates
92,320 direct jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing illustrates the tortoise-like pace of redevelopment more
than the schedule for deepening the Kill van Kull _ the harbor's
gateway to the Port Newark-Port Elizabeth complex _ from 40 feet to
45 feet. Dredging of the waterway is supposed to start later this
year and will be completed by 2003 or 2004. But between 2001 and
2003, the Sea-Land and Maersk alliance expects to begin deploying
megaships requiring channel depths of 50 feet or more when fully
loaded. Ports like Norfolk, Va., and Baltimore offer that depth,
making them attractive candidates for new business from Asia via
the Suez Canal and the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers' study of potential deepwater areas
in the harbor is not due until late 1999. Given the normal cycle of
environmental and congressional review, deepening the Kill van Kull
to 50 feet or more will not happen before 2009 _ unless the region
and its congressional delegations put the review process on a fast
track.
</P>
<P>
   The Kill van Kull is by no means the only attractive option. The
Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, N.J., could be dredged to 50
feet without the blasting the Kill van Kull needs, and its rail
access could be upgraded. But with other cities vying to be the
East Coast's first megaship port, this region's first choice should
be the site with the shortest construction turnaround for dredging
and landside development.
</P>
<P>
   If the harbor needs several deepwater terminals, building one in
Brooklyn might make sense, provided it was linked to a rail freight
tunnel, a project in its infancy, and to vastly improved highways.
Brooklynites and New Yorkers would have to decide whether the
regional benefits of a terminal would outweigh the benefits of
other forms of land use.
</P>
<P>
   No joint plan of action, however, would be complete without a
heavy, bi-state investment in cleaning up the Hudson and its
tributaries, which, despite improvements, continue to flush tainted
sediment into the harbor. The 1997 ban on disposing of contaminated
dredge material in the ocean, as well as tight restrictions on
doing so in the harbor, have spurred promising pilot projects, but
not a full-blown disposal industry. One advocacy group, the
Environmental Defense Fund, suggests that companies with
decontamination technologies be invited to develop plans for
dealing with toxic sites upstream. An aggressive program over
several decades would result in cleaner sediment moving into the
harbor. That would certainly lower dredging costs because clean
material is cheaper to dispose of and has on-land uses.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic, not incremental, progress on any of these fronts will
require more than interagency collegiality. Only the sustained
involvement of two governors and one mayor can keep the port's
21st-century potential from drifting out to sea.

LOS ANGELES: a plea agreement.

<P>
   Kretschec and the 180 or so others who gave money to Murphy in
1992 and 1993 have no reason to feel like suckers.
</P>
<P>
   The list of people Murphy apparently fooled includes dozens of
journalists, politicians, religious leaders and Trump, who heaped
praise on Murphy in the forward to his book.
</P>
<P>
   In a signed statement in the beginning of the book, Trump is
quoted as saying: ``Steve's onto something, and he's got the
investment world looking over his shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The media embraced Murphy for his rags-to-riches story and
dedication to veteran and homeless affairs. Interviewers from Larry
King to Leeza Gibbons gushed over his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murphy's book, the Los Angeles City Council adopted
a resolution in 1992 honoring him for ``his commitment to overcome
adversity and despair and for his tremendous generosity in
providing an opportunity for others to strive for a better quality
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   He placed boastful full-page newspaper advertisements: ``Stephen
Murphy is a new breed of investor. Up front. Honest. Gutsy,'' one
headline read.
</P>
<P>
   The framed Mother Teresa letter was on the wall of his office,
along with framed properties that prosecutors and investors say he
never owned.
</P>
<P>
   John and Heljo Kredjze, 78 and 74 years old respectively, lost
hundreds of thousands of dollars to Murphy from a legal settlement
related to an injury that rendered their son quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kretschec, John Kredjze was drawn in from Murphy's first
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fast worker,'' Heljo Kredjze recalls. ``My husband is
not a very hard one to fool and Murphy made a very wonderful
picture of his plans and investment opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalls that Murphy picked up on Tchaikovsky playing on a
stereo in the Kredjzes' home during one of his first phone calls.
When the couple went to see one of Murphy's supposed investments in
Palmdale, the same piece of classical music was playing on the
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then that made me think that man was up to all kinds of
tricks,'' Heljo Kredjze said. ``My husband didn't see it that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kredjzes say they gave Murphy $350,000 from the legal
settlement, later adding more from John Kredjze's retirement
account.
</P>
<P>
   Bolick said people like the Kredjzes are typical targets for the
new wave of telephone criminals. ``The senior citizens are the ones
with a lot of money at their disposal. They can liquidate their
assets quickly and telemarketers know to target the dough,'' the
FBI agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Kretschec admitted that ``greed'' was a prime reason he got
sucked into Murphy's scheme. But human nature was a big factor,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if a guy is making a living I should give him the time
to listen to him,'' Kretschec said. ``Quite frankly, I still do
that, but I won't buy anything over the phone.''
