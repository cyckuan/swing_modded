<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 9:
</P>
<P>
   The American West is a checkerboard of fires this summer, with
some 66 large wildland fires currently burning in 11 Western
states, many of them out of control. Every so often a year comes
along when conditions favor combustion. The forests and rangeland
become as dry as mouse nests, and when thunderstorms pass by,
bringing lightning without rain, ignition is inevitable. It
happened in 1988, when more than 1.5 million acres of Yellowstone
National Park went up in flames. And it is happening again now,
thanks to unusually dry vegetation, hot temperatures, low humidity
and rainfall, and winds that can fan a small blaze into a
conflagration. So far, some 4 million acres are burning or have
already burned, nearly twice the average annual acreage burned in
the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   One fire in Washington state was started by an electric fence.
Some have been started by human carelessness. Those kinds of causes
it is possible to militate against. But in an arid year in a
combustible region, after decades of unremitting fire suppression
and fuel buildup, every low-pressure system worries firefighters
because the lightning it carries is capable of touching off an
enormous number of widely separated fires. On one particularly bad
day last week, dry thunderstorms generated 75,000 lightning strikes
that sparked more than 400 new forest fires across the West.
</P>
<P>
   The fires have stretched resources to the breaking point as some
20,000 civilian firefighters have struggled for months to control
the flames and have been assisted by military battalions and crews
from Canada and Mexico. President Clinton toured the fire scene in
the Payette National Forest in Idaho on Tuesday and said he would
release $150 million in emergency funds to fight the fires. It is
badly needed. There will be time later to assess whether more
should be done in future years to reduce the volume of combustible
vegetation in the forests before they can be ignited. For now, the
critical need is to bolster the containment efforts. Rain would be
a blessing, but even a few days of high humidity and low wind would
make a difference. Some of the fires may burn until the snows
come. &QL;

TIMING'S EVERYTHING FOR U.S. SWIMMERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Notorious for their quirks and fickle
equilibriums, swimmers rarely tinker with something so sacrosanct
as the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake,'' U.S. swimmer Tom Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see where it's going to make a difference,''
backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg countered.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the toughest swim meet of their lives, the U.S.
Olympic Swimming Trials, which begin today at the IU Natatorium. So
deep is the U.S. pool of talent, the expected 1,300 Olympic
hopefuls over the next eight days will have to be at their peak
just to make the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   And surviving that, the top two finishers will have to gear up
and do it all again in Sydney in less than six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Too soon? Given the temperamental nature of swimmers, with their
shaving schedules, tapering schedules and
no-longer-talking-to-the-media schedules, it can't help.
</P>
<P>
   To a consensus gold-medal favorite such as Krayzelburg, holding
the trials in the middle of August might not matter. The native of
Ukraine is not expected to be pressed to make the team in either of
his two events, the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, youngster Ed Moses set short-course world records in
his two events, and he figures to have places locked up in the 100-
and 200-meter breaststrokes.
</P>
<P>
   But in most other events, this is no time to be gazing ahead to
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   As Krayzelburg himself said on the eve of the trials, ``There's
a lot of pressure here.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the U.S. trials have been held in March _ four
months or more before the start of the Olympics. But both the 1992
Barcelona Olympics and the Atlanta Games in 1996 began in the heat
of July.
</P>
<P>
   The '88 Olympics, held in Seoul, South Korea, began in September
of that year. Those trials were held in Austin, some five weeks
before the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The medal tally in Seoul _ 18, with only eight golds _ remains
the Americans' lowest of the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six weeks is not enough time to refocus and build your body
back up,'' Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian trials, by comparison, were held in May, as were
the Chinese team trials.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches have argued that the timing should not hurt. By holding
the trials so close to the Games, they say, the Olympic swimmers
will not be treading water on their own for the better part of four
months. With 52 Olympians making up the team, the coaches' fear is
that the athletes would have been following 52 different programs.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen this time, they say. From here, the winners
will soon reconvene in a pre-Olympic training camp.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone is to blame, the hidebound veteran swimmers are
pointing the finger at college coaches, who complained that the
traditional timing of the U.S. trials in mid-March clashed with the
collegiate schedule. Four years ago, the NCAA championships came
two weeks after the Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people are saying is true _ it'll be tough,''
Olympic gold medalist Amy Van Dyken said. ``But from my standpoint,
I'm coming back from shoulder surgery. I'm glad the trials came as
late as they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Though only 27, Van Dyken represents the old guard that will
have its hands full making this U.S. team. The Colorado resident
won four gold medals in Atlanta. Fellow sprinter Dara Torres has
two gold medals and will be swimming to make her fourth Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   But somebody is going to be left home. The women's freestyle
sprints are loaded with pedigreed performers like Ashley Tappin and
Jenny Thompson, as well as new names like Courtney Shealey and
Liesl Kolbisen.
</P>
<P>
   The world will be watching. The swim world always seems to watch
the Americans, who have won an even-400 medals since the first
Olympic swimming races were held in 1896. No nation has won more,
nor has any nation matched the 177 gold medals that U.S. swimmers
have won.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the past two times that a U.S. team competed and
didn't lead the overall swim medal count were 1956 and 1988. In
1956, the Olympics were held in Melbourne, Australia, and a rabid
crowd cheered the home team Aussies to eight golds.
</P>
<P>
   An omen?
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, the Americans again will face an enthusiastic,
partisan Australia crowd. More than 100,000 paid their way to see
the Australian trials, held in Homebush Bay in the same pool as the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Swim watchers are saying that this will be Australia's strongest
Olympic team ever. They will be shaved, tapered, rested and ready.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to hear a lot of old-fashioned American complaining this
week.

ANARCHISTS SAY THEY'RE TARGETED AT DNC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Just days before the start of the Democratic
National Convention, the North American Anarchist Conference held a
press conference Tuesday to announce they have no organized plans
to protest next week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 15 local anarchists have organized a conference to
take place this weekend _ at an undisclosed location _ to discuss
anarchist philosophy and the future of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   However _ true to anarchist philosophical form _ members said
they can't speak for 1,000 other anarchists expected in Los Angeles
next week and whether they will organize protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be held responsible for what other anarchists say or
do,'' said one member who asked only to be called Panda.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which attracted nearly 100 journalists to the
sixth floor of Patriotic Hall, became contentious as the anarchists
repeatedly tried to control in what order reporters could ask
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like all the independent media to ask questions
first, then we will call on the others. Make sure you state your
name and the organization you work for before asking your
question,'' said anarchist moderator Matt Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Members refused individual interviews unless reporters supplied
them first with business cards. Reporters were told they would be
called at a later date, in the order their cards were received.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchist group member Brendan Crill also contended they have
been singled out by the Los Angeles police and Mayor Richard
Riordan's Office as probable enticers of violence during the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have been targeted as scapegoats to crack down on
protesters during the DNC,'' he said. ``Anarchists do not believe
in violence or terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   He then clarified his remarks, saying that the four anarchists
standing before the podium at the press conference do not believe
in violence.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan spokesman Manuel Valencia said that singling groups out
has never been the mayor's intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they feel they've been singled out, that wasn't what was
meant and if we have then we apologize,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern has always been with those who are coming here
looking for trouble. What we are saying is that those who are going
to be trouble makers, harming people or property, those are the
people who better watch out because the police will be very firm
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-year-old anarchist spokeswoman Anne Kelly said the group
expects nearly 1,000 anarchists in Los Angeles next week, including
a minority faction of anarchists called the Black Block. That group
was responsible for some of the property damage caused during the
meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle last fall, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're neither associating or disassociating with them, but we
won't participate with them,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Lt. Horace Frank said it's because one person
can't speak for a whole group that the police will be ready for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``They themselves have talked about coming to Los Angeles and
shutting the city down,'' he said. ``So which is it? Who are we to
believe? I think it is better to err on the side of caution.''

EDITORIAL: MORE TEXAS EXECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 9: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are two executions scheduled in Texas this evening, but
only one is being denounced by groups ranging from the American Bar
Association to the European Union. That is because the condemned
inmate, Oliver David Cruz is mentally retarded, and it demeans the
nation's judicial system to execute a person so mentally deficient.
</P>
<P>
   This page opposes the death penalty in all cases for both
practical and moral reasons. But even among death penalty
supporters, there is a growing recognition that executing the
mentally retarded offends the most basic standards of justice. This
is partly because the mentally retarded, though perhaps capable of
distinguishing between right and wrong sufficiently to stand trial,
cannot be said to be among the most morally culpable criminals,
deserving the ultimate penalty. It is the same reason we do not
execute those under the age of 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has ruled that executing such minors and the
insane violates the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, but has
stopped short of holding the same for the mentally retarded. It did
determine, however, that jurors must be instructed to weigh
evidence of retardation as a possible mitigating factor at
sentencing. The Texas court in the Cruz case did not properly
instruct the jury on this point, and it is on that legal argument
that Cruz is hoping for an eleventh-hour reprieve from the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   In the last legislative session in Texas, the State Senate
passed a bill that would have banned such executions. The bill,
lacking the support of Gov. George W. Bush, then stalled in the
House. But Governor Bush is out of step with the mainstream on this
issue, as many states are rushing to ban the execution of the
mentally retarded. His brother, Jeb, the Florida governor, supports
such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush should take the truly compassionate step of using
his clemency powers to ensure that no more mentally retarded
convicts are executed in Texas. The legislature could then pass the
bill banning such executions in its next session. Bush should not
be embarrassed by efforts to improve the administration of justice
in Texas. What he should be embarrassed by is the callous execution
of the mentally impaired on his watch. &QL;

REAL METS DON'T STAND UP, SO THEY FALL APART IN HOUSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The New York Mets who have surged through the last two
weeks did not show up at Enron Field on Tuesday night. Mike Piazza
and Edgardo Alfonzo sat out with minor injuries. A misfiring Al
Leiter replaced the dominant one that the Mets have known. Even
Mike Bordick, the sure-handed shortstop, made an error.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 9-3 loss to the Houston Astros, who got seven
strong innings from their starter, Brian Powell. Pitching just his
second major league game in two years, Powell gave up one run, five
hits and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Powell not only outpitched Leiter (12-5), but he also popped up
a double against him off the nearby left-field scoreboard. Leiter
lasted only five innings, his shortest start this year, allowing
five runs (three earned), six hits and two walks. The Mets lost for
only the third time in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter struggled in his first two starts after pitching in the
All-Star Game, but he was masterly in his last two, allowing one
run in seven innings both times. Only 10 batters reached base via
hit or walk in those games, and Leiter won both.
</P>
<P>
   He got into trouble immediately Tuesday night. Julio Lugo hit a
routine grounder to short leading off the bottom of the first, but
Bordick's high throw pulled Todd Zeile off first base. Zeile caught
the ball and tried to swipe a tag, but Lugo was safe and Bordick
was charged with his first error as a Met, in his 10th game with
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter then walked Lance Berkman, and Jeff Bagwell grounded a
single to left, scoring Lugo. Richard Hidalgo doubled to left for
another run, and a third scored when Chris Truby grounded out to
first.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter ended the first by getting three outs in a row, but more
trouble was ahead. With one out in the second, Powell hit a ball
that would have probably been an easy flyout in any other park.
Enron Field has a 19-foot-high wall that does not angle back
measurably, and Powell's 350-foot pop grazed the facing.
</P>
<P>
   Powell pulled into second with a double, his second career hit,
and two batters later, Berkman tripled to deep center field, giving
the Astros a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Eusebio walked to lead off the fourth, but third baseman
Robin Ventura stopped Tim Bogar's ground ball with a belly-flop
dive. He fired a perfect throw to second from his knees for one
out, and Kurt Abbott completed the double play with a fine throw to
Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Leiter seemed to be in control. He got out of the fourth
and had not allowed a hit in 10 batters until Bagwell singled with
two outs in the fifth. But Bagwell stole second, and Hidalgo got
jammed but looped a run-scoring double to left. Leiter stood still
in front of the mound for about 10 seconds, his left hand on his
hip, staring at the corner where the double had knocked around.
</P>
<P>
   He would face only one more batter, Moises Alou, who lined a
ball toward Leiter's contorted face. Leiter threw his glove up just
in time to catch it, and he smiled in relief as he walked off,
shaking his glove to diminish the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter had thrown 91 pitches by then, and he was removed for Pat
Mahomes in the sixth. Benny Agbayani had homered in the top of the
inning to cut the Astros' lead to 5-1, but a ghastly inning by
Mahomes put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   It took Mahomes 39 pitches to get through the sixth. He gave up
two singles, three walks, a stolen base and a wild pitch, yielding
three runs. One of the walks came with the pitcher at bat, and
another was with the bases loaded.

MARINERS DROP THE CIVILITIES AND HAMMER YANKS 8-5 
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seattle Manager Lou Piniella stepped from the
visitors' dugout before the national anthem on Tuesday, made eye
contact with his counterpart across the field and dramatically
doffed his cap and bent a knee in respectful tribute. Yankee
Manager Joe Torre and his staff responded in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Those might be the last acts of civility between teams possibly
heading for a playoff showdown. The Mariners whipped the Yankees,
8-5, in spite of four home runs by the Yankees on a hot and steamy
afternoon, and exchanged knockdown pitches before departing Yankee
Stadium with three straight victories in the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cranky day for the Yankees. After reliever Jeff Nelson
was ejected for offering an opinion on the work of the home plate
umpire, Mark Carlson, Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' leadoff hitter,
was placed on the 15-day disabled list with an elbow injury that
may or may not improve this season.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, on the disabled list for the first time in his
10-year career, initially hurt his right elbow making an awkward
throw against Baltimore on July 24. Knoblauch's condition has not
improved, and he was given a dye test on Tuesday, which club
officials said confirmed an earlier diagnosis of inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch can still hit, in spite of his elbow trouble, and if
he cannot play second base, then Torre may consider using him as
the designated hitter. Derek Jeter led off in his place.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when David
Justice hit his 28th homer; he added another two innings later. But
in the top of the sixth inning, with Seattle leading, 3-2, the
Mariners rallied against Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and runners at first and second, Neagle got ahead
of Rickey Henderson, no balls and two strikes. But Neagle
eventually walked Henderson _ his critical mistake, Neagle would
say later. The bases were loaded, the count went to three balls and
two strikes on Carlos Guillen, and Neagle tried zipping a fastball
over the outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed-hitting Guillen poked the ball toward right
field that rode a swirling wind and just cleared the 314-foot sign
in the right-field corner for a Grand slam. Yankee Stadium will
usually be a friend to Neagle, a fly ball pitcher, but this time it
hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time anybody wraps something around the pole, there's
really not a whole lot you can do about it,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grimsley relieved Neagle and nailed Edgar Martinez with a
fastball, and Piniella patrolled the Seattle dugout, talking aloud.
When Justice came to bat in the bottom of the sixth inning,
Mariners pitcher John Halama threw a fastball behind Justice, clear
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch got away from him,'' Piniella said later. ``Although
Edgar did get hit the previous inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama said, ``Whatever Lou said stands for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice said later that he understood what Halama was trying to
do, and that he had no problem with it. But Justice did turn and
ask the umpire, Carlson, if he was going to give a warning to
Halama, and became somewhat animated when Carlson said no. Before
the next pitch, Justice stepped far back in the box, in
anticipation of another brushback that never came.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Justice was called out on strikes twice on pitches
that appeared to be out of the strike zone. Justice never said
Carlson retaliated for Justice's arguments, but it was apparent he
felt that way. ``Y'all got TV,'' Justice said. ``Y'all saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill and Jorge Posada also hit home runs _ too little,
on a frustrating afternoon for the Yanks. &QL;

BACK TO HONG KONG, WHERE THE ACTION IS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13) 
By MARK LANDLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ When Stanley Tong left his hometown for Hollywood in
1996, Hong Kong's film industry was headed for a crack-up as
spectacular as anything in a Jackie Chan movie.
</P>
<P>
   Box office revenue was plummeting, scripts were threadbare and
rampant piracy was driving a whole generation of movie-watchers
away from theaters. Demoralized by the grinding pace and
stultifying atmosphere of Hong Kong, local filmmakers fled this
former British colony faster than the British themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tong, a 40-year-old former stuntman who directed Chan in
hyper-kinetic Hong Kong action films like ``Rumble in the Bronx''
(1996) and ``Police Story III: Supercop'' (1992), did not easily
find success in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His first American film, `` Magoo,' (1997) a $30 million Disney
remake of the 1960s cartoon about a crotchety, near-sighted old
goof, left audiences as befuddled as its hapless hero.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tong has returned to Hong Kong and is back on familiar
ground _ shooting an action film about the Chinese police busting a
smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to America because I wanted to learn how to make
Hollywood movies,'' Tong said. ``But I always wanted to come back
to where I grew up. I want to make Chinese films for an
international audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Tong is one of several Hong Kong filmmakers who have come home
this year. Some were disillusioned with the vagaries of Hollywood.
Others have been lured by the new money that is sloshing around
since the end of the Asian economic crisis. Still others missed the
frenetic energy and anything-goes culture of making movies here.
Whatever their reasons, these prodigal sons of Hong Kong cinema _
most are men _ hope to revive an industry that had been left for
dead two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an optimism here which hasn't existed for a long
time,'' said Wouter Barendricht, a sales agent for Asian movies who
runs the Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum. ``People were in such
shock about the state of the industry that nothing happened for
several years.''
</P>
<P>
   After tumbling to $100 million last year from $167 million in
1993, Hong Kong's box office receipts are likely to bounce back to
$130 million this year, according to the Hong Kong Motion Picture
Industry Association. The industry will release 130 films in 2000,
one-third more than last year. At its peak, in the early 1990s,
this movie-mad city cranked out 230 films a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's resurgence has been driven by several factors. After
two years of recession, money is pouring back into film production.
Some comes from old-line Hong Kong production companies, which are
restyling themselves as Internet companies and desperately need
``content.'' Some comes from Hollywood studios, like Columbia
Pictures, which have set up local operations to finance Asian
films.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has also been helped by Hong Kong's belated
crackdown on piracy. Under heavy pressure from the United States
and the local film industry, the new Chinese government has raided
the producers of illegally copied video compact discs. Movie
executives say the campaign has worked: with bootleg VCD's drying
up, people are paying to see popular films at the multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Harder to quantify, but also important, was Hong Kong's
relatively smooth transition from British to Chinese rule. Local
studios that had cut back their spending in 1997 out of fear that
China might curtail freedoms relaxed after it became clear that
Beijing did not plan to meddle in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most basic reason is better movies. After a long
stretch of derivative action movies, Hong Kong is starting to turn
out memorable, original films. It started with ``Stormriders,'' a
special-effects-laden fantasy directed by Andrew Lau that was a
rare hit in the doldrums of 1998. It has extended through ``In the
Mood for Love,'' a finely wrought domestic drama by Wong Kar-wai.
The film won a best actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival
for Tony Leung Chiu-wai, the first for a Hong Kong actor.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' the highly
acclaimed martial-arts epic directed by Ang Lee (``The Ice Storm,''
``Sense and Sensibility''), which just has been named the closing
night film for the New York Film Festival on Oct. 8 and will open
in New York in December. Although strictly speaking not a Hong Kong
film _ it was co-financed by Columbia and Lee is from Taiwan _
``Crouching Tiger'' used a Hong Kong production crew and features
two of its hottest stars, Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Crouching Tiger' is a milestone for the local film
industry,'' Barendricht said. ``It's an Asian film with a strong
Hong Kong base. That's what this industry is increasingly going to
look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong films used to be filmed only within the territory and
only in Cantonese, which made them difficult to market overseas.
Tong recalled how difficult it was to sell early Jackie Chan movies
to American studios. Not until ``Rumble in the Bronx,'' which had
dialogue in Chinese and English _ and was putatively set in New
York _ did Chan break through.
</P>
<P>
   The returning filmmakers are determined not to be parochial.
Tong is shooting his new film, ``China Strike Force,'' in Chinese
and English (less challenging than it sounds, given its lengthy
action sequences). He also chose Shanghai as the location, partly
because it is cheaper than Hong Kong, but also because he wanted to
get to know mainland China better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the world's major film industries, Hong Kong has the
smallest home market,'' Tong said. ``If you have a movie that only
works in Hong Kong, you are dead before you start. If we can get
good distribution in China, it will be our biggest market in 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tong knows the theme of his movie will play well with the
Chinese authorities. The fight against smuggling and other forms of
corruption is a hot button with the Communist leaders, including
President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, both of whom
are former mayors of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Chan is another local director who came back to Hong Kong
with a view to expanding the industry's horizons. Chan, 37, spent
three years in Hollywood, where he directed Kate Capshaw in ``The
Love Letter'' (1999). He recently started a Hong Kong-based
company, Applause Pictures, that will develop pan-Asian pictures.
Among his first projects are films by mainland Chinese and Thai
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Chan said the best Asian films increasingly travel across
borders. A recent, if somewhat mournful, example was a low-rent
Japanese horror film, ``The Ring,'' which managed to clobber its
local competition to become one of Hong Kong's highest-grossing
films in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Applause Pictures is backed by Star East, a Hong Kong company
that is transforming itself into a one-stop shop for Asian
entertainment on the Internet. It plans to produce movies and
television shows, sell merchandise and create Web sites for
performers throughout the region. What Star East needs _ and what
Chan will happily supply _ are movies to fill all these
distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   I could have come back, hired the 10 best directors in Hong Kong
and set about rebuilding the golden age of the Hong Kong cinema,''
Chan said over a cup of coffee in the gilded lobby of the Peninsula
Hotel here. ``But I don't believe there can be another golden
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Tong, Chan said Hong Kong _ with a population of 6.8
million _ was simply too small to recapture its once dominant role
in the Asian film industry. On the other hand, its marquee
directors, crackerjack production crews and deep pools of capital
make it a natural hub for a regional industry.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not all Hong Kong filmmakers have given up on the idea of a new
golden age. Another of the returnees, Tsui Hark, the acclaimed
director of ``Once Upon a Time in China'' (1991), recently finished
shooting a fantasy film (as yet untitled) that is a sequel to his
1983 classic, ``Zu, Warriors From the Magic Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the latest in computer-generated special effects but
drawing on a 500-year-old Chinese legend, Tsui hopes to bring a
world of mythical warriors soaring above mist-shrouded mountains to
a new generation of moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was filmed in Beijing, ``Zu'' is a typical Hong Kong
production. It was shot on a tight budget and an even tighter
45-day schedule that required the cast and crew to work round the
clock. On one particularly grueling day, Tsui slept fitfully in a
chair next to the set, while an exhausted crew set up a shot
involving the film's hero and heroine soaring through the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Such brutal schedules used to be common here because of the
large volume of productions and the relatively small number of
actors and directors. This contributed to the poor quality of Hong
Kong films, because directors often began shooting with only the
semblance of a script. Scenes were often added or cut willy-nilly
to suit the schedules of double-booked stars.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, Hollywood's influence is making itself felt. Tsui,
who spent two years in the United States making Jean-Claude Van
Damme films (``Double Team,'' 1997, and ``Knock Off,'' 1998), said
he now worked with finished screenplays. Tsui also immersed himself
in American production techniques and brought some back to Asia.
The special effects designers on ``Zu'' are from the United States.
Despite the film's frantic schedule, Tsui said, he has throttled
back his pace to one or two movies a year, instead of several.
</P>
<P>
   Tsui's other new project, ``Time and Tide,'' exemplifies the new
discipline in Hong Kong movie-making. The $3.8 million action film
is backed by Columbia Pictures, which monitored every aspect of its
budget and production schedule. Although the film is a shoot-'em-up
about Chinese gangsters, Tsui agreed to cut some of the violence
from the script to satisfy the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hong Kong, producers hire directors and leave them alone,''
said Tsui, a 50-year-old whose wild hair and unlit cigar make him
look like an enfant terrible. ``But in Hollywood, they want to know
what the story is about. They're very focused on details.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lee's ``Crouching Tiger'' is an indication, the discipline of
Hollywood may result in better films. But Barbara Robinson, the
managing director of Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia, notes
that old habits are hard to break.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these directors know what it takes to make a Hollywood
movie, it doesn't follow that they will stick to those principles
back here, if they can get away with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsui, for one, seems like a grudging convert. Although he
concedes that Hong Kong's film industry was almost killed by bad
movies, he still sees merit in its frenetic, on-the-fly culture.
While he welcomes Hollywood's money, he does not want to create a
Hollywood of the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the studio ideas come from video stores,'' he said. ``I
think it's very silly.''

CRISSCROSSING THE WIDE MAP OF AMERICAN MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 13) 
 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few nights after Nick Spitzer was ousted from his job as a
disc jockey, his friends on the Philadelphia rock station WMMR-FM
gave a farewell party. They had listened over the previous two
years as Spitzer had spun Bessie Smith and Merle Haggard during
afternoon drive-time, and they knew that the program director had
been ridiculing the choices as ``nostalgia music.'' Now, in
December 1973, Spitzer had resigned rather than be consigned to the
2 a.m. shift, when his taste could do little damage to ratings.
</P>
<P>
   So Spitzer's girlfriend at the station presented him with a copy
of the book ``Country Music, U.S.A.,'' even though she herself
preferred British Invasion bands. Another colleague handed him a
Sony cassette recorder bought with donations from staff members.
For his own part, Spitzer vowed to his friends, ``I'm going where
music is made, not where records are made.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter-century later, that party looks more like a
beginning than an end. Spitzer's uncompromising passion for
American music in all its vast variety has found expression in the
nationally syndicated public radio program ``American Routes.''
Part travelogue, part oral history, part musical survey, the show
is 100 percent Nick Spitzer, which is to say that in a given two
hours each week it might range from Thelonious Monk to Doc Watson
to Lauryn Hill, stopping along the way to interview a New York
cabbie or a Delta barber, deliberately heedless of categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to enlarge someone's ear,'' Spitzer said during a
recent telephone interview from the ``American Routes'' studio on
Royal Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans. ``You want them
to listen to the radio and say, `What's that?' The secret is to be
sui generis.'' More deeply, he explains: ``I'm not a
multiculturalist. I'm a creolist. I'm drawn to the boundaries where
cultures meet and overlap and simmer together. I gravitate to mixed
realities.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three years after its debut, ``American Routes'' has
been picked up by more than 175 stations nationally, including such
powerful National Public Radio affiliates as WAMU in Washington,
KOPB in Portland, Ore., and KUOW in Seattle. (In New York, WFUV-FM,
90.7, carries the show at 5 p.m. on Sundays.) The music critic Nat
Hentoff, writing in The Wall Street Journal, likened ``American
Routes'' to an evening spent with the legendary folklorist Alan
Lomax.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has achieved such success against significant odds.
Commercial rock radio, eclectic if sometimes amateurish in its
early days, has been divided into rigid niches for more than a
generation. Many of the college stations that kept alive the
free-form style during the 1980s have more recently tied themselves
to the Adult Acoustic Alternative format, known in the field as
Triple-A, which aims at baby-boomers with folk-rock artists like
Shawn Colvin and John Prine. And NPR affiliates have tended to
limit themselves to a single style of programming, whether jazz or
classical or information. Even syndicated music shows, like
``Afropop'' or the Celtic ``Thistle and Shamrock,'' generally hew
to a single identifiable genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orthodoxy of ratings thinking,'' said Steve Behrens,
editor of Currents, a trade newspaper covering public broadcasting,
``is that you want a constant format so people can know what
they'll hear whenever they tune in. If you're not playing what they
want, they may not come back. And if they don't come back, they
won't become members and financial supporters. So public-radio
people are reluctant to split their format. It takes convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Routes'' has surmounted such wariness partly by dint
of Spitzer's own reputation, built up during a 25-year career as an
author, anthropologist, record producer, radio host and
music-festival impresario. From its outset, ``American Routes'' has
been identified with him in the way that ``This American Life'' is
indelibly tied to its creator and host Ira Glass or ``Fresh Air''
is to Terry Gross. And the roots of Spitzer's sensibility go back
well before his professional radio career.
</P>
<P>
   Now 49, Nick Spitzer grew up in Manhattan and Long Island as the
son of a refugee and a rebel _ a German Jewish father fortunate to
have come to America for college before the Nazis barred the door,
and a blueblood mother whose forebears left their native Virginia
as abolitionists. From his father, a trained cellist who worked as
a chemist in the United States, Spitzer received an immersion in
Beethoven and Wagner. From his mother, behind the wheel of a '51
Plymouth, he got the scent of adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every night, she'd put my brother and me in the car for
our `sleepy-bye ride,''' he recalled. ``She'd play the radio and
we'd see the city. We'd hear the ocean liners tooting on the river.
We'd go to Harlem. We'd go down to Greenwich Village and see the
Beat crowd. My mother believed all of America is part of what our
lives should be.''
</P>
<P>
   On the radio, meanwhile, Spitzer heard Mel Allen and Red Barber
jawing their way through Yankees games, Cousin Brucie and Murray
the K working through the pop charts. ``What I took away was two
things,'' he said. ``The visual imagination of radio _ that you
could be listening to a game from out west and visualize that
ground ball hitting a rock and bounding into left field. And that
rock and roll was cracking into the Top 40 and changing my idea of
music. In school, you're singing `15 miles on the Erie Canal,' and
here's `I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill.'''
</P>
<P>
   During college at the University of Pennsylvania, Spitzer put
his welter of musical interests to use both at the campus radio
station, WXPN, and in the folklore department, where he took a
course in cowboy songs and did research among the Italian-Americans
in South Philadelphia. Even before Spitzer found and lost the job
at WMMR, one of his professors was steering him to the graduate
program in folklore at the University of Texas in Austin. There, he
steeped himself in the mongrel cultures that to this day fascinate
him _ the Mexican, Czech and German mixture in South Texas; the
French, African and Caribbean melange of New Orleans and Cajun
Louisiana. And he came to realize that he was as estranged from the
academy as he was from commercial radio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world of folk music, there are hard-core academics who
don't want anything contaminating the purity of the songs,''
Spitzer said. ``They're not open to the idea of cultural mixture
and synthesis. They have the idea that everything radiates out from
the pure center and the bounds are questionable. But the bounds are
where I went.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the late 1970s he produced a couple of zydeco records,
boarded for a while with the fiddler Dewey Balfa and began
compiling, on his Sony cassette recorder, what is now a 1,000-hour
collection of oral histories. He raised grant money for Louisiana
to create a position of state folklorist, to which he was promptly
appointed. And when he developed cancer in the mid-1980s, he took
Cajun and Afro-Caribbean folk remedies in addition to chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Spitzer began working with the producer Mary Beth
Kirchner on a series of folklore documentaries for Radio
Smithsonian. ``From the moment I met him,'' she said, ``I knew
there were few people in the country who could assemble music and
voices the way he could.'' Spitzer reported several folklore
segments for NPR's ``All Things Considered'' in the early 1990s,
and he and Kirchner developed radio broadcasts from a series of
folklore concerts he arranged for Carnegie Hall and Wolf Trap.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seemed to Kirchner that none of those forums had fully
captured the Nick Spitzer who had burst into her office back in
1977 rhapsodizing about zydeco music, the Nick Spitzer who could
wax for an hour about any record he owned. In early 1997, when his
resume was nearly 20 pages long and she had won an Alfred I.
duPont-Columbia University Award for producing the radio
documentarian Norman Corwin, Kirchner called him with a dare:
``You've wanted to do a show for 25 years. Maybe now's the time to
do it. Otherwise, you'll spend the rest of your life wondering,
`What if?'''
</P>
<P>
   The pair applied to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for
a $90,000 grant, enough to prepare three months' worth of weekly
shows. The corporation, duly wowed, unilaterally tripled the
amount. In November 1997, Spitzer launched ``American Routes'' on
the community station WWOZ in New Orleans with Clarence Bonton
Garlow's rendition of that Cajun incitement to revelry, ``Bon Tons
Roulet.''
</P>
<P>
   By early 1998, American Public Radio (since renamed Public Radio
International) was syndicating ``American Routes'' to 39 stations.
While Kirchner, as executive producer, wrote the grant applications
and pitched the show at public-radio conventions, Spitzer infused
it with his aesthetic. From the beginning, each ``American Routes''
broadcast adopted a particular theme _ daily life in the Delta, for
instance, or the legendary highway Route 66 _ and explored it
through both music and taped interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Famously loquacious off the air, Spitzer speaks on ``American
Routes'' mostly through the recordings themselves and his crafty
way of structuring a show. Sometimes, as in a segue from Howlin'
Wolf to Tom Waits, Spitzer suggested lines of influence across
genres; sometimes he emphasized the disparity in interpretations,
playing the original cast recording of ``Old Man River'' from
``Showboat'' right after a version by the jazz saxophonist Gene
Ammons. Without being pedantic about it, Spitzer also enhanced the
show with his scholar's knowledge, for instance explaining after
Dr. John's cover of ``Junco Partner'' how its syncopation grew out
of inmates' work songs at the Angola state prison in Louisiana and
was called the ``jailbird beat.'' Several stations that carry
``American Routes'' have been pressing for Spitzer to spend more
time on-mike himself.
</P>
<P>
   By now, nearing the third anniversary of ``American Routes,''
Spitzer commands a budget of $500,000 and a full-time staff of
five. Though he consults ``Country Music, U.S.A.'' from time to
time, he has retired his Sony cassette recorder to an exhibit in
the Louisiana capitol building. But he still ventures out to record
interviews, recently speaking with a New Orleans plasterer named
Allison (Totie) Montana, who doubles as the Big Chief of a tribe of
Mardi Gras Indians. The result, in typically catholic Spitzer
fashion, will air on a Labor Day weekend show that also explores
the legacy of Woody Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the show I wanted to do when I left Philadelphia,''
Spitzer said. ``There was no outlet for it then. Finally, I had to
build my own.''

L.A. TOPS CHICAGO, N.Y. IN MANUFACTURING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite job erosion and few smokestacks on the
horizon, Los Angeles County remained the nation's top manufacturing
center last year with the San Fernando Valley playing a key role, a
study to be released Wednesday concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The county averaged 643,400 manufacturing jobs during 1999 and
the third-largest concentration of them was in the San Fernando
Valley, according to the study by the nonprofit Los Angeles
Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago ranked a close second and Detroit was third. New York,
which often draws comparisons with L.A., ranked fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Being No. 1 is a familiar spot for the county. It's been the
nation's biggest manufacturing center, jobwise, every year in the
1990s but three; Chicago held the title from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And manufacturing will continue to thrive in the region, the
report predicts.
</P>
<P>
   There is a skilled work force that can make satellites, digital
optics equipment and fabricated metal to exacting tolerances. And a
number of sectors, including high technology, are supported by
clusters in various areas such as Pasadena, the western San
Fernando Valley and the neighboring Conejo Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Being No. 1 is more than symbolic, notes Jack Kyser, the
nonprofit group's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a status thing but if you're an area that has a lot of
immigrants, manufacturing can help these people get good jobs and
get assimilated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The county's concentration of manufacturing jobs reflects this,
with South Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley ranking one and
two, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Include all five Southern California counties and the region had
more than 1 million manufacturing jobs last year. Add in San Diego
and factory jobs along the Mexican boarder makes this one of the
largest manufacturing centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it over the long haul the big surprise is that
the Los Angeles region lost so much aerospace and despite that,
it's still the nation's leading manufacturing center,'' said Ted
Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   While the raw numbers are impressive, the number of jobs has
been slipping, especially in the aerospace and apparel sector,
Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   And Los Angeles is by no means the manufacturing powerhouse it
once was. Manufacturing employment, for example, peaked in 1987 at
887,200 jobs, 243,800 more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   So there is cause for some concern.
</P>
<P>
   The study said attention should be focused on:
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing quality industrial sites, which can be accomplished
by recycling older land with environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paying more attention to training workers at the high school
and junior college level.
</P>
<P>
   _ Informing the business community about incentive programs that
can increase the number of manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meeting infrastructure needs like increasing airport and
freeway capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said job erosion began in the first quarter of 1998 and
should continue through at least this year. Most of the losses have
been classic aerospace positions.
</P>
<P>
   And the sector is also hindered by a shortage of industrial
space.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Ventura County has been in a manufacturing
growth mode since 1996 and should reach a new high this year with
about 40,400 jobs. Aerospace and high technology is a major driver,
accounting for 26.5 percent of these jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing has been growing in the Riverside/San Bernardino
area since 1994 and will also reach a new high this year with an
estimated 123,800 jobs. The Inland Empire is one of the few areas
where land is available for new facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturing still plays a key role in the economy of
Southern California despite stories to the contrary,'' Kyser said.

A VAUNTED MUSICAL TRADITION SEEN THROUGH FRESH EYES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 13) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARLBORO, Vt. _ We've been trying to figure out what to call
this thing for 50 years,'' Frank Salomon said of the venerable
Marlboro Music School and Festival, which ends its 50th season here
today with a public concert. ``It is not what people customarily
think of either as a school or as a festival.''
</P>
<P>
   True, it is an odd school that has no teachers or students; only
participants, as they are called, some with much experience, some
with little, purposefully mixed and working together in rehearsals
and performances of chamber music. The learning is in the doing.
And it is an odd festival that determines its concert programs only
a week or so in advance, trusting listeners to travel from far and
wide all unknowing, and welcome whatever pieces and performers are
put before them.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anything is left to chance; far from it. The event is
closely administered, as it has been for some 40 years, by Salomon,
a concert manager and artists' representative from New York, and
Anthony Checchia, a concert manager from Philadelphia. And there
are artistic directors: New ones this season, in fact, the pianists
Richard Goode and Mitsuko Uchida. But apart from special areas of
concentration _ music this year (and this afternoon) by Thomas
Ades, the composer in residence; discussions of Bach performance
next year by the cellist and Baroque specialist Anner Bylsma _ they
have little say in the repertory, which is determined on the basis
of request lists from the participants.
</P>
<P>
   Goode and Uchida are the only directors since the distinguished
pianist Rudolf Serkin, who died in 1991, having run the festival
for most of its first four decades. Goode was present for the first
three weeks of the seven-week season, and Uchida for the last six.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no platforms, no slogans,'' Uchida said. ``At
Marlboro, we simply look deeply into the music and have time to do
so, and we share it with everybody and in some cases with the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   That looking deeply happens in rehearsals, which are the
lifeblood of the festival. The daily round of activity is
simplicity itself. Like-minded performers are put together in rooms
on the tiny campus of Marlboro College to rehearse specific works
drawn from those request lists. Distractions are few, for the
college, housed in a converted dairy farm, is some two miles from
the center of this southern Vermont town, also tiny. If and when
the rehearsals come to fruition, the piece may be put on a concert
program either in the dining hall for an invited audience or in
Henry Z. Persons Auditorium for the general public.
</P>
<P>
   But managing the system, with 75 performers distributed among
various groups, ranging from a few to a dozen or more, with at
least one experienced participant in each, is, to say the least,
complex. Performers rehearse from three to five pieces in different
groups for as much as 28 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony McGill, a superbly talented young clarinetist recently
hired by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, was heard repeatedly in
a day with eight solid hours of rehearsal. ``Is it harder on the
brain or on the lips?'' Uchida asked during one rehearsal, of
Schoenberg's ``Pierrot Lu-naire.'' The lips, McGill reported.)
</P>
<P>
   Alisa Belzer, the scheduling director, tracks it all with
color-coded cards on a big grid of a board. Why not a computer?
``Scheduling software is either too big or too small,'' Belzer
said, making clear that she had answered that question far too
often. ``There are so many idiosyncrasies that it would need to be
a powerful program, like something used at an airport. It would be
really expensive, and I'm not sure it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the board is part of the quaint, treasured Marlboro
tradition. So is the road sign ``Caution: Musicians at Play,''
which is supposed to stand near the entrance to the campus but was
stolen again this year. And so arethe wadded napkin balls that have
filled the air during meals ever since a young Judith Serkin, now a
senior cellist at the festival, and her father, Rudolf Serkin,
pelted each other decades ago. ( Uchida congratulated herself at
one meal on being unaccountably but blessedly exempt from attack.
She was beaned moments later.)
</P>
<P>
   Marlboro wears its history heavily. The festival was founded in
1951 by an illustrious group of musicians, all immigrants from a
war-torn Europe: Adolf and Herman Busch, Serkin and Marcel and
Blanche Moyse. Adolf Busch directed it for one season before his
death in 1952, when Serkin took over. Of the group, only Blanche
Moyse is alive, still conducting Bach at 90. Famous participants
over the years have included Pablo Casals, Alexander and Mischa
Schneider, and Felix Galimir as mature artists, and Yo-Yo Ma,
Emanuel Ax, Van Cliburn, James Levine and any number of others in
their youth. Many a musical partnership was forged here, and some
45 marriages had their start. (Not all lasted.)
</P>
<P>
   The histories of the festival read disconcertingly like ``The
Lives of the Saints'' and seem at times to suggest that nowhere
else is musical performance approached with anything like the same
probity and seriousness of purpose. An oppressive air of reverence
can stir resistance in a first-time visitor. But it doesn't last
long. For Marlboro does in fact seem to be a haven for idealism
unusual if not unique in the music world. Here, after all, are
musicians at the top of their field, freely passing on the lessons
of experience for no pay, expecting in return only the joys of
collaboration and some renewal in their own psyches.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestral players have perhaps the most to gain from so radical
a change of scene. ``In my world you hit a certain point where you
stop learning,'' said Richard Hawley, the principal clarinetist of
the Cincinnati Symphony though still young himself. ``You don't
stop improving, but thought and concentration are difficult when
you're part of an orchestral jukebox. This is a place to grow and
develop.'' At the same time, orchestral players have much to lose
financially. By taking leave from most of their summer employment,
they may give up as much as $10,000 of their annual salaries while
receiving pittances for expenses along with transportation costs
and housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody coming here is not coming to make money,'' Uchida said
with righteous pride. It is especially hard to attract top-level
soloists, who stand to make a great deal on the summer-festival
circuit. ( Uchida and Goode are, of course, such soloists, and they
are not paid even for their additional duties as directors.) Uchida
grudgingly envisions a day when it may be necessary to pay to get
the right people. Nor would such practice be without precedent;
Casals was paid, paid a lot, Uchida said, and that in a day with
fewer competing opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to payment is evidently philosophical rather than
financial. With an endowment of more than $25 million, Marlboro
seems to be well heeled. Much of its annual budget of $1.5 million
goes for fellowship aid to help cover the costs of room and board
for the younger participants on the basis of individual need. The
participants are expected to pay a nominal amount toward these
costs as well as provide their own transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about it, but maybe you feel it,'' Uchida said
approvingly of the lack of payment to the senior participants.
``That may make the crucial difference in the spirit of the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors in that spirit as well, including a
deep-seated sense of community, which centers on the dining room, a
former barn. Participants mingle freely at meals. At dinner, all
the participants, even the most senior, take turns waiting on the
others. Between meals, the dining room (along with virtually every
other room on the campus) is used for rehearsals, and on Wednesday
evenings, it is used for concerts, as it was regularly in the years
before the auditorium was built on the campus, in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, to judge from a recent array of rehearsals
and concerts, Marlboro is a model of musical democracy in action.
Not only does the repertory reflect the desires of individual
performers, necessarily in varying degrees, but the rehearsals also
encourage a free and open interchange. Older players tend to couch
suggestions in deferential terms (``if everyone agrees''), and
younger ones seem unafraid to pipe up. (It may not always have been
thus; stories of outbursts by the excitable Galimir, who died last
fall, are legion.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet however much Marlboro's programming may depend on the
personal preferences of participants, the basic repertory has
always leaned heavily on the Germanic classics favored by the
European founders, particularly Serkin. That emphasis seems
unlikely to change. ``We're both Germanophiles,'' Uchida said,
speaking as well for Goode in his absence ``We overlap so much. We
both have a huge love of Debussy and Chopin, and we'd both be
perfectly happy without a note of Tchaikovsky.'' But Uchida also
stressed the new directors' commitment to contemporary music,
especially in the form of the composer-in-residence program, which
had been dropped for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the stability, not to say predictability, of
Marlboro's basic repertory over the years is that new performers
are always eager to trot out some of the standards on their own.
Given the theoretically unlimited rehearsal time and the
availability of so many fine and varied collaborators, participants
like to venture into music they don't often perform with their own
groups or can't master with a few of their friends.
</P>
<P>
   There is thus a premium on the big pieces of the chamber
repertory like, this season, the octets by Schubert and
Mendelssohn, and Dvorak's Opus 44 Serenade. Works that mix strings
with winds, like the Schubert and the Dvorak, or add singers are
also choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brahms songs with viola are performed at least every
year,'' Stephanie Houtzeel, a mezzo-soprano who has performed them
here, said with some exaggeration. But sure enough, here they were
again, being performed by another young mezzo-soprano, Carola
Guenther, with Ryo Sasaki, a young violist, and Luis Batlle, a
pianist and longtime Marlborough participant. And for one listener,
Guenther's smooth, warm interpretation of the two songs, though
heard only in rehearsal, was a highlight of these visits.
</P>
<P>
   The other was a luminously transparent performance of
Schoenberg's ``Verklaerte Nacht,'' brilliantly led by Hilary Hahn,
the young violinist, and anchored by Siegfried Palm, a veteran
cellist. Palm, in another Marlboro tradition, often honored in the
breach this summer, played second cellist to a young first, Sumire
Kudo.
</P>
<P>
   Houtzeel, meanwhile, gave a fine, strong account of Ravel's
``Sheherazade,'' and Guenther began grappling less securely with
the Sprechgesang of ``Pierrot Lunaire'' for a performance this
weekend. For that is another kind of work that makes particular
sense at Marlboro: One that requires endless rehearsal. Uchida
scheduled 17 rehearsals, 1 fewer than when she performed the work
here a few years back with Galimir as the guiding force from the
violin. At the 13th rehearsal, fairly basic issues were still being
discussed, like how to differentiate the sound and mood of one song
from the next. What was most fascinating was the extent to which
all the instrumentalists took an interest in the meanings of the
German text and the ways they should be expressed in every part.
</P>
<P>
   Another rehearsal showed how quickly such lavish rehearsal time
can be taken for granted and how difficult it must be to readjust
to the real world after the season. In the third movement of
Prokofiev's First String Quartet, Samuel Rhodes, the longtime
violist of the Juilliard String Quartet, asked for a restart at
rehearsal No. 29 in the players' parts. At a later stopping point,
Emi Ohi Reznick, the second violinist, wanted to go back to No. 33.
Colin Jacobsen, the first violinist, commented on ``something four
bars before 31.'' But then Rhodes recalled something else, even
farther back. ``In that case, let's do three before 30,'' Jacobsen
said, putting things almost back where they had started the time
before.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such intensive labors, some works never find their way
to the concert stage. Nor, in some years, do all the participants,
although each performed at least one work this year. The official
emphasis, therefore, is on the value of the learning process in
rehearsal rather than on performance. But as Checchia, the
administrator, pointed out, ``The performance is also part of the
learning process.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the weight of its traditions and all of its proven
success in training performers, Marlboro has undergone change
throughout its history. During the Casals era, the 1960s and '70s,
orchestral music was performed in quantity; it is rare today. Even
opera has occasionally been represented. But undoubtedly the
biggest shock was the death of Serkin, whom the board found
literally irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything here has sort of evolved,'' said Salomon, the
administrator. In this case, the board formed a senior artistic
committee of three performers, Uchida, Goode and Andras Schiff,
another pianist. But Schiff eventually yielded to other demands,
including his own summer festival in Hohenems, Austria. Uchida and
Goode were appointed directors last November.
</P>
<P>
   The future looks bright indeed. New participants are selected on
the basis of auditions, first on tape, then live, and the caliber
of the players applying and being accepted has perhaps never been
higher, said Carol Faris, the admissions director. In view of the
remarkable track record of Marlboro alumni, that is a claim to be
taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But the future can wait. First come a few more glances back. The
festival's touring arm, Musicians From Marlboro, will present three
anniversary programs in November, all passing through New York. In
the first, at Carnegie Hall, Goode and Uchida are to perform Bach's
Concerto in C for Two Keyboards (BWV 1061).
</P>
<P>
   Bridge Records plans to release an anniversary set next year,
and Sony Classical has already released another on two CD's. It is
especially notable for the inclusion of a Serkin favorite,
Beethoven's Choral Fantasy. Tradition again: Serkin used to perform
this work to end the season, with the whole community joining in
the chorus. In this performance, from 1981, his son the pianist
Peter Serkin conducts, and the choral singing is lusty and
committed, giving a sense of the force this festival tends to exert
on those in contact with it.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every performer encountered this summer recounted that
his or her first experience at the festival had been a
life-altering experience. One who did not, oddly, was Uchida. ``I
didn't really understand what it was about,'' she said of an
isolated visit in 1974. She returned in 1992 as part of that
post-Serkin stopgap committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I take away a lot,'' she said. ``Selfishly, that's what I
come for. I always go away enriched.''

WILLIAMS GETS BAD BREAK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ The third time proved anything but the charm
for USC defensive tackle Jamaal Williams, when X-rays revealed he
broke his leg on the first day of training camp, the third fracture
in less than 12 months for the true freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Williams suffered a hairline fracture in his right leg and will
redshirt this season. He is expected to be out four to six weeks.
His injury came just one day after USC coach Paul Hackett
identified him as the surprise of last week's freshmen-only
practices.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Monday's accident, which is becoming a trend for
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 260-pound lineman broke his leg last September in
the season opener for St. Augustine High outside San Diego. He
missed the rest of the year. The second break occurred last March
in a basketball pickup game. Then came Monday's mishap, when his
leg was hit during a drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the first one, I've lost a lot of calcium,'' Williams
said. ``I think that's what happened. I'm going to have to start
taking a lot of calcium pills. This one is less severe though. It's
more like a hairline fracture.''
</P>
<P>
   All three fractures have occurred in bones located directly
above Williams' foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play this year, but I guess this is a redshirt
year, which is fine,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said the Trojans might move a player over
to the defensive line to compensate for any potential depth
problems.
</P>
<P>
   __ Different time, same result: USC's kicking woes of spring
continued in training camp, as none of the kickers distinguished
themselves in Tuesday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off to a bit of a shaky start with the kicking, which I
anticipated,'' Hackett said. ``The holding and snapping are still
getting settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior David Bell, junior David Newbury and freshman John Wall
of Birmingham High are fighting for the kicking job, but at least
one decision has been made: Free safety Ife Ohalete will be the
holder. Defensive tackle Bernard Riley is the early leader to be
the snapper.
</P>
<P>
   __ Nonqualifier: Defensive tackle Sagan Atuatasi did not fulfill
the necessary academic requirements and will not be admitted into
the university. He had been attending junior college the past year,
after playing football at Los Alamitos High.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett might give Atuatasi's scholarship to a walk-on, with
senior wide receiver Matt Nickels and senior linebacker Ryan
Shapiro the top candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nickels has a slight advantage over freshman Keary Colbert to be
the No. 3 receiver, as Hackett remains disappointed in sophomore
Steve Stevenson, who is out with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   __ O-line update: The depth chart remains unsettled, but right
now the starters along the offensive line are Brent McCaffrey (left
tackle), Trevor Roberts (left guard), Eric Denmon (center), Zach
Wilson (right guard) and Jacob Rogers (right tackle). This is not a
set lineup, however, and junior Faasea Mailo is being considered
for a starting position at either tackle spot.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential starter at right tackle is true freshman Joe
McGuire. He has been beaten a few times early by veteran defensive
linemen, but offensive line coach Steve Morton said those
occurrences are quickly diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing improvement,'' Morton said. ``Physically, he has
the tools, it's just a matter of picking things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson returned from summer school and practiced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   __ A legacy: Safety Kyle Matthews of Westlake High is walking on
to the team. He is the son of former USC linebacker Clay Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-player, 1979 Lombardi Award winner Brad Budde,
attended Tuesday's practice.

LIVING UP TO THE MEMORIES OF A POETIC OLD SKYLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 13) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is a plea on behalf of ethos, the set of
cultural values that underlies the forms of artistic expression _
or eidos, if you'll excuse the Sunday morning anthropology lesson
I'm about to foist on you. The ethos of ancient Egypt, for example,
was theocratic hierarchy. Its eidos was the pyramid. Nice forms,
pyramids. Not so nice, the beliefs that gave rise to them. But it's
enlightening to know about the beliefs nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions are now being made about a cluster of major civic
projects that, between them, will exercise an unprecedented impact
on the immediate and long-range future of New York. All the
projects have an important role to play in meeting the fundamental
challenge faced by New York and other aging urban centers: The
transition from the industrial city of the 19th century to the
cultural matrix of the 21st. The projects are on different scales,
and each calls for a different eidos _ a distinctive formal
response. But the ethos that should shape these responses is the
same: Sense of place; historical awareness; an educated view of
where history is going; and a receptive state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   As of this writing, decisions are imminent on two contested
Manhattan sites. They are 2 Columbus Circle, the midtown site now
occupied by Edward Durell Stone's Venetian-style campanile,
originally designed for Huntington Hartford's Gallery of Modern
Art, and the East River waterfront property, just below South
Street Seaport, on which the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation
proposes to build a museum designed by Frank Gehry. Also in the
works are a waterfront park for Brooklyn and a citywide plan
designed to attract the 2012 Olympic Games to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Just last spring, it was possible to predict with some
confidence that cultural values, in particular architectural
values, would play little part in the outcome of these and other
civic projects. Rather, the choices would be driven by a
combination of economic and political considerations. There was
cynical speculation that before heading off to Washington, Rudolph
Giuliani (as is often the norm in politics) would directly or
indirectly reward his supporters with real estate development
plums.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, of course, is that the mayor will not be
heading to Washington. He will presumably not be leaving City Hall
before his term runs out. And, because of the mayor's brush with
mortality, he is said to be better disposed than formerly to do the
right thing. New Rudy or not, this is as good a time as any to talk
about good things, and about some of the bad things that prevent
good things from happening in architecture _ that prevent the ethos
from taking architectural form.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can make a list of bad things. Mine would include the
cultural illiteracy of key decision makers, both in city government
and in private civic groups; the notion that the new buildings for
cultural institutions can be mere boxes for housing cultural
functions; the failure to grasp, therefore, that the cultural
responsibility of the container is at least as great as the
contained. Not least, one must factor in the interlocking wheels of
public relations and private dealmaking that join to bestow vaunted
cultural status on utterly worthless buildings.
</P>
<P>
   I want to focus on the Guggenheim project because, of all the
plans now pending, it is the eidos that draws most deeply from the
New York ethos: The city's open-endedness, its receptivity to
change. As such, the project could help shape the standards by
which designs for other civic projects should be judged.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside for the moment the particulars of Gehry's design and
the global ambitions of Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim Museum's
Napoleonic director. Look instead at the landmark that has
commanded the East River waterfront, on the Brooklyn as well as the
Manhattan sides, for more than a century. Consider the mental as
well as the physical landscapes dominated by the Brooklyn Bridge,
the bridge's impact on the imagination of citizens, painters and
writers, its metaphoric as well as its functional value.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Think about Hart Crane, the great lyric poet of 20th-century New
York. Crane's opus, ``The Bridge,'' the democratic ideals
symbolized by the bridge and the cultural milieu that supported the
expression of those ideals _ these are as finely woven into the
Guggenheim's site as the cables that support the bridge's roadbed.
Come now, do you really want to see this site submerged beneath the
platforms of some river-themed upscale floating hotel? (That is the
other plan the city is considering.)
</P>
<P>
   If you live in Brooklyn, you can see the Brooklyn Bridge as Hart
Crane thought it should be seen: As a portal from the old world to
the new. At once a departure and an approach, the bridge summons up
images of things left behind and things as yet untried. It
stretches between an ending and a beginning, the familiar and the
unknown, hierarchy and equality, ancient customs and freedom from
them.
</P>
<P>
   The skyline of lower Manhattan, which Crane photographed from
his window at 110 Columbus Heights, was a vision of possibility.
Or, as Whitman phrased it more simply two generations before, ``The
shapes arise!'' Together, bridge and skyline were the eidos, the
formal expression of ideas the poets put into words.
</P>
<P>
   This is the background against which the Guggenheim project
should be seen. While not conventionally contextual, Gehry's design
is acutely responsive in formal terms to the lower Manhattan
skyline and the riverfront location. It is a tripartite
composition, divided horizontally. The public spaces at the base,
including an immense skating rink, extend the river surface inland.
The steel cloud above is fashioned from titanium ribbons; within
are galleries and a central atrium. The cloud appears to be
composed of long strips of reflective river surface that have been
loosely wrapped, an unstable mass of creative energy. Above that, a
450-foot tower appears to lean slightly to the north, as if
awestruck by the skyline's panache.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can claim that this is a background building. To blend in
would be alien to its nature. This is due not only to the formal
originality of Gehry's design, but also to the idea animating it.
That idea, simply put, is that subjective expression has a critical
role to play in architecture at this moment of the city's
transition from an industrial to a cultural space.
</P>
<P>
   We are accustomed to subjective treatments of the city in
poetry, painting, film, photography, music, fiction and dance. And
we bring our own subjectivity to bear when we gaze at the skyline.
But we still expect the architects of individual buildings to
conform to some imagined objective ideal. Buildings should not be
artistic performances. They are not sculpture. They should not be
individualistic or, to cite a term that has been misapplied to
Gehry, egocentric.
</P>
<P>
   So-called contextualism is the latest version of this prejudice.
It restricts architects to the dictates of external authority _ in
this case, the forms and scale of neighboring buildings. It denies
them the freedom to reckon creatively with the city as it evolves.
As a consequence, it prohibits the city itself from becoming the
architect's muse.
</P>
<P>
   There is a picture of the man who served as Crane's muse during
the time he was writing ``The Bridge.'' His name is Emil Opffer. He
is shown standing on the roof of 110 Livingston Street, with the
bridge in the background. Opffer himself was a bridge. He enabled
this deeply introverted, alcoholic poet to engage with the world in
a far more direct, physical way than was possible with his writings
alone. Opffer was a bridge toward love and the inspiration that
comes from it.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's muse was a merchant seaman, frequently absent, which
probably satisfied the poet's need for romantic yearning. And
Opffer's roving, maritime life drew the sea into the compass of
Crane's mental landscape. It is the sea, not just the East River,
that Crane's bridge is always crossing. In 1932, at age 32, Crane
drowned himself in its depths.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real context from which Gehry's design springs. The
design denies any inherent distinction between architecture and
other forms of cultural expression. That denial is based on a sharp
historical awareness of the city at this moment. It is not an
expression of ego. It reflects a solid grasp of the role
architecture ought to play in the cultural city. It, too, is a
bridge, a span between past and future. More than a mere monument
to itself, the design recaptures the unfamiliarity that the skyline
represented for Crane.
</P>
<P>
   Cities are productive places. If they can no longer support
industrial production, they must throw their weight behind cultural
production. They must look beyond the model of cultural consumption
toward a more productive set of conditions. If they remain content
to package culture as an inventory of select consumer products,
their future will be indistinguishable from that of a suburban
mall. Gehry's design points the way out of this fate. The fluid
line between our inner and outer worlds _ between the objective and
the subjective _ is one of the critical cultural issues of our
time. The Guggenheim plan frames this issue more concretely than
any New York has seen.
</P>
<P>
   Under Krens' direction, the Guggenheim has carved out a singular
place for itself in the cultural system. The museum's exhibitions
are occasions for consumption, but they are also creative
productions in their own right. So is the Guggenheim's global
network of branches. These are at once centers for culture
consumers and components of a larger, creative vision of art as a
form of international exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As I think back on the exhibitions mounted during Krens' tenure,
I am struck by how many of them have taken urbanization as their
subtext. For example, the present show, ``1900,'' documents the
relationship between industrial and cultural production in the era
of the great world's fairs. As such, it offers a prehistory of the
present moment. ``The Great Utopia'' and ``The Italian
Metamorphosis'' have also provided historical slices that
illuminate the contemporary urban condition.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is said to be a traditionalist. So am I. But New York's
most vital tradition is its ethos of change. To represent that
enduring ethos, the eidos must change. This is the city's great
paradox.
</P>
<P>
   People should not be asking whether Gehry's design fits into the
context of lower Manhattan. They should be asking whether New
York's new buildings fit into the urban context that Krens, among
others, has been putting together. That context is now global, but
in origin it is local. It is New York's gift to modern times.

   What renowned American classical ballet company garnered enough
engagements in 1999 to employ its dancers for an impressive 41
weeks? The Joffrey Ballet, maybe? American Ballet Theater? No, it
was Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, fondly known as the
Trocks, home of bulldozing stars like Olga Supphozova and Ida
Nevasay-neva. The company, opening at the Joyce Theater on August
15, will present two repertory programs consisting primarily of
Slavic chestnuts, including the New York premiere of an impeccably
affected ``Raymonda's Wedding,'' coached by Elena Kunikova. Because
of an advance sell-out of their last Joyce engagement, the Trocks
are extending this year's New York summer season to a full two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping ballerinas who are veritable ships of state in working
form requires running a tight ship. Although heavy on levity, the
all-male comedy ballet troupe, now in its 26th year, is run by a
troika of no-nonsense leaders: Eugene McDougle, the general
director; Tory Dobrin, the artistic director; and Pamela Pribisco,
the ballet mistress. Their ingredients for financial as well as
artistic success consist of low-cost, high-quality productions,
impressive technical standards, audience accessibility and an
undeniable talent for slapstick.
</P>
<P>
   Not a drop of grant money has ever been received by the Trocks.
During the dance boom of the 1970s, the Trocks qualified for the
National Endowment for the Arts' Dance Touring Program and became
one of its biggest moneymakers. According to the program's
guidelines, however, it was the sponsors who received the money,
not the Trocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that one of the reasons that the company has
been financially successful was that we didn't get any funding in
the beginning and did not, therefore, build up a superstructure
that required a lot of money just to maintain a large staff and
office space,'' says McDougle. He and Dobrin still run the company
out of their apartments, renting rehearsal space at City Center
when not on tour.
</P>
<P>
   After a slump in the 1980s, when the quality of the productions
suffered, the Trocks pulled themselves up by their point shoe
ribbons and developed a more professional look. Nancy Gabriel, vice
president of IMG Artists, which now handles bookings for the Trocks
and other high-profile companies like the Parsons Dance Company and
Pilobolus, identifies the Trocks' critically acclaimed 1997 London
season at the Peacock Theater as a turning point. ``Their level of
artistry, technique and comedic genius have never been at a higher
level in their 26 years of existence,'' Gabriel says. ``They are
attracting the best dancers who are getting rave reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the Trocks of yesteryear felt quite at home
falling off point, it is not unusual to see their current crop of
16 ballerinas churning out batches of triple fouettes or propelling
themselves well into the stratosphere. When Madame Supphozova (aka
Robert Carter) launches into a diagonal of chaine turns in
``Paquita,'' her tutu takes on the ferocity of a buzz saw.
</P>
<P>
   The newly acquired technical superiority can be attributed to a
generally higher level of male dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better trained they are when they come in,'' Pribisco
says, ``the easier it is for them to learn to do point work,
because it's not a different technique. It's an additional
knowledge that they haven't experienced yet, because men don't do
that vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   Les Ballets Grandiva, a successful male troupe founded by a
former Trocks dancer, Victor Trevino, has also benefited from
better male dancers. Paul Boos, a New York City Ballet alumnus who
coaches Grandiva's dancers, stresses that, although the ballerinas
may be portraying wilting sylphs or spry soubrettes, the physical
demands of their performances are high.
</P>
<P>
   The wild popularity of Grandiva and the Trocks in Japan has
provided a substantial part of their meal tickets. While the Trocks
toured 37 cities in the United States and 6 European countries in
1999, the company recently completed its 16th Japanese tour with
fees that actually produced a surplus. Its high jinks may be a
perfect outlet in a nation that appreciates the broad sense of
humor displayed in Tokyo's television game shows.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a similarity to the Kabuki Theater tradition, and not
just in the form of heavily crayoned eyebrows and brazenly slashed
eyeliner, that begs comparison. ``We fit into their cultural
norms,'' McDougle says. ``Traditional Japanese theater has been
totally male dominated. They have no problem accepting us as men
doing women's roles.'' The adulation has even taken the form of an
organized fan club of giggling teen-age Japanese girls who hurl
bouquets at their favorite divas.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of overall marketability, Gabriel praises the
flexibility of the troupe. ``Sometimes they are presented on a
straight dance program, other times on a variety or special
attraction series, on a comedy series, or even on a family series.
In short, there is almost always a place for them.'' Exquisitely
made costumes, accompanied by simple sets, keep the freight costs
of touring down.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be ignored is the audience appeal of old-style, Ballets
Russes-inspired divas vamping in the spotlight and flaunting their
indispensable mannerisms. ``Everyone in the Trocks is encouraged to
really go to the max with their personalities,'' says Dobrin.
``And, you know, it's much easier when you have a wig, makeup and
eyelashes on. You tap into those areas of your character that are a
little wacky anyway.''

BEAUTIFUL TO HEAR, AND TO SEE

  (For release Sunday, August 13)

   WASHINGTON _ Perhaps more than for any other people, music has
been an integral part of the lives of Africans. Whether it has been
the chants of boatmen on the Niger, or the sound of the kora (a
kind of lute) played by a griot as he recites the history and
genealogy of a people, or the brassy horns and vibrant rhythm
sections of a contemporary band in a Lagos nightspot, Africans _
and their descendants in the diaspora _ always seem surrounded by
music. So it hardly comes as a surprise for a museum curator to
decide that traditional African instruments should not only be
listened to but looked at.
</P>
<P>
   That is the point of ``Audible Artwork: Selected African Musical
Instruments,'' a pleasant though rather modest exhibit showing here
at the National Museum of African Art through April 8. Mounted,
encased in glass and subtly lighted, the wooden rasps, gongs,
rattles, drums, thumb piano and whistles that make up the exhibit
shed their utilitarian mien, presenting themselves as objects of
art.
</P>
<P>
   Music seems to be a prevalent theme for the Smithsonian
Institution this summer. Across the garden from the Museum of
African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery is presenting ancient
Chinese instruments in an exhibit called ``Music in the Time of
Confucius.'' Not far away, the National Museum of American History
is sponsoring ``300 Years of the Piano.'' It seems as though the
museums are striving to make up for this city's discordant
political rhetoric with a reminder that life is often harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to these other exhibits of musical instruments, the
small scale _ 11 pieces _ of ``Audible Artwork'' gives the Museum
of African Art's effort a kind of ``me too'' quality. Still, it is
worth the time minutes it takes to enjoy, not only for the beauty
of the instruments but also as a primer on the breadth of African
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people tend to think of African art only in terms
of masks, figures and drums,'' said Bryna Freyer, the exhibit's
curator. ``I think it's getting better in that regard because of
our museum and other museums like us. The fact that we put on shows
of pottery, and small personal objects and musical instruments,
tends to say to people out there: `Hello! This is art work! This is
important!'''
</P>
<P>
   There is an opportunity to listen to the instruments, of course.
The exhibit provides a station with headphones that allows a
visitor to hear traditional drumming by the Ga peoples of Ghana, a
song accompanied by a five-string harp fashioned by the Zande
people of the northeast Congo and a harvest celebration in Burkina
Faso featuring xylophones, gourd drums and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   But the exhibit's point is visual, not auditory, and each of the
pieces is presented in elegant simplicity. As visitors enter the
exhibit room at the bottom of a staircase on the second level of
the underground museum, they immediately see two sistrums, a kind
of rattle. The first, fashioned by the Bamana people of Mali, is
made of wood and gourds. With the pie-shaped gourds hanging on the
end of a polished stick that itself resembles a wishbone, the
Bamana sistrum looks like a mushroom doubled over from a punch to
the gut. It is unadorned, like those that accompany the chants of
young Bamana boys as they march to be initiated into the n'tomo
youth association. Once they have gone through this rite of passage
on the way to manhood, their sistrums would be decorated with grass
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   On a slightly more grand scale is the sistrum used to mark time
in an Ethiopian Orthodox Church service. Grasped with a handle made
of horn, the sistrum has two ornate copper alloy pillars, each
topped with an onion-shaped dome. The intricate working of the
brass is a testament to the craftsmanship of the late 19th and
early 20th century artisans.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the exhibit is a large drum made around 1935 by the
Ghanaian artist Oseil Bonsu, perhaps the most important Asante
sculptor of the 20th century, who is well known for the drums he
created for the Ntan society _ a kind of civic association that
also performs at weddings, funerals and festivals. Bonsu's drum is
a brightly painted hodgepodge of symbols and tales in red, green,
brown and beige. It contains breasts, probably representing
fertility, as well as pictures of puff adders capturing frogs,
birds, elephants and palm fronds. It sits atop a figure of a lion.
One could spend hours transfixed by this alluring drum, trying to
figure out all its maker is trying to say.
</P>
<P>
   While there are more formidable pieces in the exhibit, none can
match the stark beauty of the wooden three-note whistles of the
Nuna people of Burkina Faso. In their most basic function, they
serve as a signal for hunting dogs. They are also played in
ensembles at funerals and celebrations of the hunt. Propped in a
display case, they seem like stylized stick figures of an eerily
human form, standing arms akimbo.
</P>
<P>
   Next to them is a tiny whistle carved from ivory in the late
19th or early 20th century by a craftsman from either the Mbun or
the Pende tribe (the curators are not sure which) of the Congo. The
rounded figure with the quizzical face seems a perfect symbol for
the show. Its sound commands hunting dogs to pay attention. Its
elegance _ like that of the show as a whole _ implores visitors to
do the same.

HMS PINAFORE SAILS UNDER THE ISRAELI FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)  
 By JULIUS NOVICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The good ship Pinafore looks familiar enough, with
its big nautical steering wheel at center stage, but why is it
flying the Israeli flag? The tunes are Arthur Sullivan's good old
tunes, but what's with the lyrics? ``Ikh bin der keynig fun dem
yam.'' What happened to ``I am the monarch of the sea''? The
dialogue is in English (mostly) and some of it is right out of W.S.
Gilbert's original libretto (some of it).
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert wrote that ``love levels all ranks,'' but he didn't
write: ``After all, can't an Orthodox marry a Reform? And can't a
Litvak marry a Galitzyaner?''
</P>
<P>
   Only in the Gilbert and Sullivan Yiddish Light Opera Co.'s
production of ``Der Yiddisher Pinafore,'' currently anchored on
Saturdays and Sundays at the New 14th Street Y, through Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   When Gilbert and Sullivan opened their own New York production
of ``HMS Pinafore'' in 1879, Gilbert told the audience, ``It has
been our purpose to produce something that should be innocent but
not imbecile.''
</P>
<P>
   This would not seem to be a promising formula for show-business
success these days, when so many entertainments manage to be
imbecile without being innocent. Yet Gilbert and Sullivan have
turned out to be astonishingly durable over the years, even
emerging as the heroes of the recent popular film ``Topsy-Turvy.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Der Yiddisher Pinafore,'' adapted by two founding members
of the company, Al Grand and Bob Tartell, Little Buttercup, now
Kleyne Putershisl (literally, Little Butterbowl), still comes
aboard to peddle her wares to the sailors, but her sales pitch now
rhymes ``knishes'' with ``delicious.'' Ralph, the sailor-hero, is
now Labe, but he is still a tenor, and he still loves Rokhl,
originally Josephine, the daughter of Der Kapitan _ much to the
annoyance of Shloyme der Shlemiel, formerly Dick Deadeye. Der
Kapitan, too, is furious: he intends to marry his daughter to Der
Admiral, and has already hired the caterers. Rokhl, of course,
loves Labe, though how can she marry him? Isn't he a Gentile? But
just at the point where, in Gilbert's script, the hero is proudly
proclaimed ``an Englishman,'' it is revealed that Labe is ``a guter
Yid'' _ a good Jew. The lovers are united, and the show ends with a
hearty ``Mazel tov!''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has its headquarters in Merrick, on Long
Island, has been in existence for two decades and has toured the
East Coast as well as to England and Canada, playing ``Der
Yiddisher Pinafore,'' ``Der Yiddisher Mikado'' and ``Di Yam
Gazlonim'' (``The Pirates of Penzance''). The performers include
professors and former opera singers. Tartell, a retired dentist who
also produced ``Pinafore,'' plays Der Kapitan. Al Barouch, a
cantor, is the musical director; he plays Labe when he is not
conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Few members of the company are fluent in Yiddish. Some,
including Georgia McGill, the director of the show, are not even
Jewish. Why then perform in Yiddish? Not in order to reach an
audience for whom Yiddish is a first language; for all practical
purposes, such an audience no longer exists. But it seems that the
very tenuousness of Yiddish's post-Holocaust survival makes people
want to revive and propagate it.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Nesbitt, who plays Der Admiral, told the Hadassah
magazine: ``Every time we do a show, I feel like I'm putting
another nail in Hitler's coffin. That's the language he wanted to
eradicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the company hopes to preserve Yiddish, why do they
perform Gilbert and Sullivan rather than Yiddish material?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, because they love Gilbert and Sullivan.
Furthermore, down-to-earth Yiddishkeit stands out all the more
vividly against such a genteel, Victorian ever-so-English
background. The company is asserting the right to bring proud
Jewishness into the very midst of Anglo-Saxon culture. ``We are
Diaspora Jews,'' Tartell said. ``And we've done what Jews have done
through the centuries _ taken something from their surrounding
community and wed it with something from their heritage, and given
that to the world.''

PELOSI LEADS LAWMAKERS ON TOUR OF SILICON VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Introducing Old Democrats to the New Economy, Rep.
Nancy Pelosi will lead 38 House colleagues Wednesday on a detour
through Silicon Valley and San Francisco's Multimedia Gulch on
their way to the Democratic convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The group will breakfast with venture capitalists, mingle with
industry chieftans, &LR;  like Jerry Yang of Yahoo and John Warnock of
Adobe Systems, and dine with Gordon and Ann Getty. They will visit
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. to discuss online stock investing, get a
biotech briefing at Alza Corp. in Mountain View, and finish up with
lunch at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch in Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   The group will have members of the Bay Area's delegation,
including several who oppose the high-tech industry on its top
issues: freer trade with China, more H1B visas for skilled
immigrants and tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi helped lead the unsuccessful effort in the House to block
permanent normal trade relations with China. Others, including
Oakland's Barbara Lee and the East Bay's Pete Stark, have voting
records that put them solidly at the bottom of the scorecard issued
by the Information Technology Industry Association, a Washington
lobby that tracks such issues.
</P>
<P>
   The tech lobbies are thrilled nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrific they're coming out,'' said Lezlee
Westine, acting co-chief executive of TechNet. ``I think what
they'll realize is that Silicon Valley is very policy driven, and
the recent vote on permanent normal trade relations with China,
which had 75 percent of Republicans voting yes, really bought a lot
of goodwill for Republicans in Silicon Valley. ... The more
dialogue they can have with nonpartisan Silicon Valley executives
the better it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   With the world now marveling at the unprecedented tech-driven
economic expansion, Democrats and Republicans have been making
regular pilgrimages to Silicon Valley, promising aid on policy and
pleading for campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Democratic trip will coincide with a visit by
several Republicans led by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, &LR;  and
including Tom Campbell, a Silicon Valley representative now running
for the Senate against incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the Democratic trip, Pelosi said, is to allow members
``to breathe the air and drink the water of entrepreneurship that
is palpable and tangible in our area.''
</P>
<P>
   That way, Pelosi said, they can return to Washington ``better
equipped to shape solutions that are in our public interest but
sensitive to the concerns of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip will showcase Pelosi's efforts to fashion what she
calls a ``New, New Democrat,'' a political hybrid who is neither an
old-fashioned tax-and-spend liberal hostile to business, nor a
member of the ``New Democrats,'' the moderate wing that has spent a
decade trying to shift the party to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, New Democrats are not so sure about this New
New hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhetoric has changed, but it's not necessarily backed up
by votes,'' said one New Democrat House member, adding that
Pelosi's own voting record ``suggests she doesn't even know where
Silicon Valley is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you have a zero voting record (on tech issues), you
can raise money in Silicon Valley,'' this member added. ``All roads
now lead to Silicon Valley and Northern California. It's a
beautiful place and everyone wants to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tech-driven economic expansion has proven so spectacular
that it has dramatically shifted the political terrain in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Atkinson, technology policy director for the Progressive
Policy Institute, the New Democrat think tank, said the new economy
is forcing old Democrats to reposition themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of the past decade, it has become more and
more obvious that old economic rules don't apply and that the old
liberal formulas don't apply either,'' Atkinson said, citing large
government social programs, command-and-control regulation and
policies focused principally on income redistribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of the world and the changes in the economy make
those old approaches invalid,'' Atkinson said. ``I think liberal
Democrats understand there's this new challenge out there for them,
and that holding on to old ways isn't going to get them anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, House liberals complained that the nation's chief New
Democrat, President Clinton, was abandoning core liberal values --
on trade, on welfare, on spending -- in his efforts to lay claim to
the political center.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the promised payoff has arrived. The economy is
generating huge budget surpluses, freeing liberals from the
constraints of deficits that for years hindered the creation of big
new programs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Democrats can advance a new prescription drug benefit for
Medicare and still claim fiscal prudence, while Republicans find
themselves on the defensive, saying they want a prescription drug
benefit too.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi believes that Old Democrat ideals can be joined to the
New Economy. ``The progressive philosophy...serves us well in this
new era,'' she said in a conversation earlier this year. `'I am a
committed liberal, but that doesn't mean I'm wedded to the old way
of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt _ who will join the trip
with a press conference near San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel on
Thursday _ signalled the party's change of stance in a major speech
to Northern Virginia tech leaders last March, where he lauded the
wonders of the new economy and promised that ``high tech issues
will flourish'' in a Democratic-led House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role can be a constructive one if we adhere to an approach
that allows the private sector the breathing room to solve some of
these problems itself,'' Gephardt said. ``I look forward to leading
a Democratic House that does everything possible to ensure that we
can continue this longest peacetime expansion, with technology
leading the way.''

 BUCHANAN WINS REFORM FIGHT  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan's ``peasants with pitchforks'' grabbed control of
the Reform Party Tuesday as former backers of party founder Ross
Perot walked out of a rancorous party meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial session of the party's 168-member national committee
meeting in Long Beach took place just before the opening of
tomorrow's four-day party convention. It was designed to let the
warring factions resolve questions about the legality of the
party's mail-in primary and an attempt to bar the conservative
Buchanan from the Reform Party ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the closed meeting ended with about 60 anti-Buchanan
delegates stalking out as uniformed police officers tried to break
up the various pushing and shouting matches taking place outside
the meeting room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over now,'' said Bay Buchanan, the candidate's sister and
chief political adviser. ``It is Pat Buchanan's nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dissenters went to a hotel a block away and held their
own national committee meeting, which they said represented the
real Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see some semblance of order before the convention
opens, but I don't see it happening,'' said Donna Donovan, a
dissident who was fired as the Reform Party spokesman by Buchanan
backers earlier this week. ``You can't negotiate with outlaws.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos surrounding Tuesday's meeting has been more the rule
than the exception for the Reform Party in the past few weeks. The
party, which united behind Perot four years ago, has broken into
squabbling sects as Buchanan has moved closer to the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the party's executive committee announced that
they had tossed Buchanan off the ballot for vote fraud, charging
that he had illegally signed up hundreds of thousands of his
backers as Reform Party members.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, party chairman Gerald Moan, a Buchanan backer,
said the action was illegitimate because two of the committee
members had been recalled a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Buchanan said the Reform Party was doomed if they
blocked his nomination and blasted the efforts of former party
Chairman Russell Varney to keep him off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offer the Reform Party a fighting battle, and what Mr.
Varney and the rest of them are offering is a great mix of
Kool-Aid,'' he said, referring to the Rev. James Jones suicide
potion in Jonestown.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a conservative commentator, bolted the Republican
Party last October after two unsuccessful runs for the GOP
presidential nomination. He said at the time that his populist
message was now a better fit for the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   The prize for the Reform Party nomination is $12.6 million in
federal campaign funds, based on Perot's performance in 1996. While
the country is unlikely to elect a third-party candidate, the
millions in public funding could make the Reform Party candidate a
very visible player on the national scene.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Buchanan's success stems from the ``Buchanan Brigades,''
supporters he has pulled together in his other runs for the
presidency. Many of them, Republicans and independents, have
followed him in the third-party bid.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of REFORM08 (76690 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Pat Buchanan went into 30 states and won the vast majority of
the (Reform Party) delegates,'' said K.B. Forbes, a spokesman for
Buchanan. ``On the other side are people who have lost continually,
but who won't accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the party ripped in half, the future of the convention also
is in doubt. Anti-Buchanan forces have suggested that they could
flood the convention with their own backers or even hold a separate
convention of their own.

 A RICH HISTORY WORTH SAVING: Philanthropist David Packard is on
a  crusade to restore film classics  
 (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 By MICK LaSALLE  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ On a balmy Saturday night in July, shortly
before a screening of ``Roman Holiday,'' David Packard unlocks a
glass case and puts up photos of the film's star, Audrey Hepburn.
Dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt, he rearranges the photos
until he comes up with an aesthetically satisfactory arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   In another movie house, such a task might have been left to an
employee making scarcely more than minimum wage. At the Stanford,
it's done by Packard himself, the self-described ``partially
benevolent dictator'' and heir to the Hewlett-Packard billions.
</P>
<P>
   That Packard discovered and came to love classic American cinema
is one of the luckiest things that ever could have happened to
classic cinema. In the past 20 years, Packard, 59, has done more
for film preservation than any private citizen in history,
funneling millions upon millions of dollars into archives such as
the Library of Congress, the University of California at Los
Angeles and the George Eastman House.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the Stanford is just the tip of the iceberg with regard
to Packard's efforts, it is also, to mix metaphors, the jewel in
his crown. Packard has restored the 1925 theater to lustrous glory
and devoted much of his energy to showing vintage films there. The
Stanford specializes in films from the 1910s to the early 1960s,
everything from ``Intolerance'' to ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night Packard takes the stage and, as is his
prerogative, introduces the film. He tells the packed audience that
Audrey Hepburn is his favorite actress. He also allows that he
wouldn't mind showing only her films, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a great speaker,'' Packard explains a couple of days
later. ``I don't say very much. But people just like that somebody
is running the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet all is not well in Packard's world. The week before, the
film critic for the Palo Alto Weekly, Jeanne Aufmuth, was quoted in
that newspaper as criticizing Packard's programming. She said he
showed the same films over and over, and that his movie choices
were turning the theater into a ``blue hair'' place.
</P>
<P>
   Packard is angry, and ready with statistics showing that seniors
make up only 10 percent of the audience for films such as ``Roman
Holiday'' and that 8 percent of the audience consists of people
younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's morning, two days later. Packard is at his foundation's
office. He's still outraged. He painstakingly goes through the
schedule to show that most of the new schedule is made up of
Stanford Theatre firsts, including a series of obscure silent films
Packard recently had restored at the Stanford Theatre Foundation
Film Preservation Laboratory, his facility at UCLA. But what most
rankles him is the accusation that the Stanford is a ``blue hair''
place. ``That's the most outrageous lie.''
</P>
<P>
   He has the weekend box-office figures to prove it: 928 regular
tickets sold, 140 seniors. ``It's not that I, becoming a senior
myself, don't like seniors. It would be kind of discouraging to run
a nostalgia show with tottering old people trying to remember their
youth. That's not what's going on at the Stanford Theatre.''
</P>
<P>
   For a man who broods over comments made in a suburban weekly, he
is singularly unworried about making himself ingratiating to the
press. ``This is a reporter,'' he says to one of his employees.
``You can touch him if you like.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard is not the easiest person to talk to. At times he seems
to be applying his considerable intellect to trying to figure out
what diabolical snare awaits him behind questions such as why
Audrey Hepburn is his favorite actress. ``I hope I don't have to
explain to you why people love Audrey Hepburn,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about a comment he made about feeling ``discouraged''
with age, Packard bristles. ``You're trying to do a personal story
about me. This is not about me. This is about the theater. I told
you the rules, and I'm talking about film preservation, and the
Stanford Theatre and everything we do. I'll tell (set ital)you(end
ital) what we can talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is put off by Packard's idiosyncratic charm. Paolo
Cherchi-Usai runs the Eastman House archive in Rochester, N.Y., and
deals with Packard regularly. ``I kind of understand why he talks
to me that way. If I were him, I'd probably do the same. It's a way
of breaking the old rules. Beneath the way he addresses you, the
tone he uses, the way he leaves you off guard, is a whole set of
challenges _ ways he wants to check your reaction. Even if I had
nothing to do with film preservation, I'd still like the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard did not spend his life watching movies. Until he was 35,
he had little interest in film. He was a professor of ancient Greek
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when a friend
invited him to a screening of ``The Wizard of Oz.'' If he had a
Damascus-like conversion, it came the second night, when he saw the
Judy Garland film ``Meet Me in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was, supposedly an intellectual. Why would I love `Meet
Me in St. Louis' so much? I don't know, but I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   From then on, he ``quietly started getting interested in
movies.'' He moved to Los Angeles to teach at UCLA and gradually
got to the point where he was going to repertory houses all the
time. It was also at this point, as a board member of the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation (his parents' organization), that he
started giving grants to the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

COMMENTARY: A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for changes throughout)   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As though this presidential campaign did not
already have enough father-son drama, now comes the mother of all
contests between Father and Son.
</P>
<P>
   The main battleground state is the state of grace. Democrats and
Republicans are seeking a geographical advantage, but it is
celestial. Both sides seem weirdly obsessed with snagging a divine
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   W. brazenly tried to lay claim to the Son, accepting Christ as
his personal savior and favorite political philosopher, and
proclaiming June 10 Jesus Day in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president chose to contest this holy ground by
revealing that he was a born-again Christian who often asked
himself ``W.W.J.D. _ What Would Jesus Do?''
</P>
<P>
   But with the two sons fighting over the Son, Gore decided to
find a running mate with direct access to the Father. The usually
cautious Gore made an inspiring and brave choice of a senator named
Lieberman, the first Jew on a major party's national ticket and a
believing and practicing Jew who regularly invokes God.
</P>
<P>
   In his Nashville debut on Tuesday, Lieberman mentioned God 13
times in 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The last pol to break a religious barrier, Jack Kennedy, always
played it coolly secular. He would never have prayed in a campaign
speech, or conceded he might be tied up with religious rites on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, JFK promised to keep religion out of politics.
Now candidates promise to drench politics with religion.
</P>
<P>
   Trumpeting values and godliness is the way these boys of summer
promise to exorcise the frisky ghosts of Bill and Monica from the
sacred Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton dominates the race he is not in. In '92 he chose
Gore as his running mate because he needed the Tennessee senator's
Dudley Do-Right image. Having a Vietnam vet and a family man beside
him allowed Clinton to seem less slippery.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight years later, Mr. Clean found himself in need of a Mr.
Clean.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has come away from the White House sex and money
scandals with a patina of grime. The vice president who was chosen
for rectitude, not geography or charisma, felt he needed to choose
a running mate for rectitude, not geography or charisma.
</P>
<P>
   After defending the beleaguered Clinton as ``one of our greatest
presidents,'' Gore had to make up for that ill-considered moment by
choosing a new partner whose piety offset his old partner's
hedonism.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to denounce Clinton as
``immoral'' during the Monica megilla, saw the offer from Gore as
comparable to being ``called to the ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is in a bitter competition with the first
lady for campaign money and attention, and yet he has ended up
picking someone who might help her in New York. (Hillary wasted no
time in trying to co-opt Lieberman to campaign with her, noting
demurely, ``but I can't be greedy.'')
</P>
<P>
   The new Democratic ticket must take care not to overdo the
sanctimony as they run away from the lame-duck rogue. Al must sweep
into Hollywood with a guy Hollywood can't stand. Lieberman has
teamed up with the conservative Bill Bennett to castigate Hollywood
for its moral ``toxicity,'' saying the town ``doesn't understand
piety.''
</P>
<P>
   He has excoriated the NBC megahit ``Friends'' as too sexy for
prime time and suggested that the FCC review the content of
programs when renewing licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville, the senator hailed Tipper for the puritanical
crusade that the Gores have spent years begging Hollywood to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bush team praised the selection, we must keep an
eye on that nasty Republican fringe. When the going gets tough, the
hardball henchmen around the Bushes have a way of exploiting
differences and craftily implying that anyone who is not like us is
not ``on the American side,'' as Bush Pere put it at the flag
factory during the Willie Horton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The McCains are still seething about Bush supporters in South
Carolina spreading word of their dark-skinned adopted daughter from
Bangladesh. And in '88 Michael Dukakis, with his Greek roots, was
treated as an exotic. On the Bush bus, Loretta Lynn complained of
Dukakis: ``Why, I can't even pronounce his name!''
</P>
<P>
   We can only dread what will happen when this crowd wraps its
tongue around Hadassah.

   Certainly, if Packard's manner is less than sparkling, his good
deeds are manifold. At Eastman House, for example, he has built
nitrate vaults to store archival film material. ``Most donors are
eager to spend money on a film and have their name on it,''
Cherchi-Usai says. ``Building a structure that's essentially a
large refrigerator, that's not appealing to many donors. David is
one of the few who understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard donated money to the American Film Institute's
three-volume catalog of ``Feature Films, 1931-40.'' His foundation
_ the Packard Humanities Institute _ is putting up $20 million
toward restoring and restructuring San Jose's Fox so it can house
Opera San Jose for part of the year. The theater will also show
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Packard's most astounding philanthropic feat was on behalf of
the Library of Congress' film archive. The archive needed a
facility to do its storing, cataloging and film restoring.
Packard's foundation spent ``6 or 7 million'' to buy a never-used
structure built by the Federal Reserve to house currency in the
event of a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past two years, we've been working on a plan for
redoing it for (the Library of Congress') needs,'' Packard says.
``It will cost $100 million to complete this enormous facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kinds of numbers Packard deals in. The Packard
Humanities Institute has assets of $2 billion. ``By law, a
foundation has to spend 5 percent. We have to spend $100 million a
year, so we have a duty to concentrate on big things.'' Besides
film preservation, the institute funds projects in archaeology,
music and history. The complete papers of Thomas Jefferson,
Benjamin Franklin and George Washington are in the process of being
put online for everyone to use.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford Theatre story began in 1987. Packard rented the
theater for two weeks to hold a Fred Astaire festival. ``I remember
pacing up and down on the Friday the festival opened, thinking to
myself, `If 50 people come, it'll be worth it.' Well, I think we
had just about a sold-out theater on Friday, and on the first
Tuesday night we sold 1,250 tickets, and it was the night of the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my father there that Tuesday, and he couldn't believe
how many people were coming and what a good time they were having.
He had a very good instinct about human nature,'' Packard recalls.
``He said, `David, I never would've believed this, but you've
proved your point. If you want to do this, the foundation will pay
for it.' So we bought the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford Theatre was closed for two years to bring it back
to its 1925 splendor and to make seismic renovations. It reopened
in December 1989 with ``The Wizard of Oz.'' Since then Packard has
balanced his appreciation for mainstream fare from Hollywood's
golden age with a willingness to show newly restored obscurities
that no commercial theater would dare put onscreen for fear of
going broke. Films restored at the preservation laboratory he set
up on the grounds of UCLA regularly turn up on the Stanford
Theatre's calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really does care about movies,'' says David Francis,
curator of the Library of Congress collection. ``He is absolutely
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stanford Theatre is my cultural crusade,'' Packard says.
``I want people to grow up loving Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn and
Jimmy Stewart. I don't understand why there's one theater that
shows `Roman Holiday,' `Top Hat' and `Meet Me in St. Louis,' and
there are hundreds and hundreds showing all kinds of stuff. The
balance is way off. I'm sure some of the people seeing the
second-rate things that are out now would be happier seeing the
first-rate things made in the last 100 years.''

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ ``I've been interested in film preservation
since 1980 _ much longer and on more of a scale than anybody,''
says David Packard, owner and programmer of the Stanford Theatre in
Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Packard's work has been at the University of California
at Los Angeles, where he is regarded not just as a donor but as a
colleague as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very advantageous relationship, very amiable and
pleasant,'' says Eddie Richmond, who runs the UCLA Film and
Television Archive. ``He shares our passion, involvement and
interest in film. For David, film preservation is a necessary step
on the way toward making films available to people. He believes
that movies are meant to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Films restored with Packard's funding include ``Morocco''
(1930), ``The Man I Killed'' (1932), ``The Smiling Lieutenant''
(1931) and ``The Plastic Age'' (1926), and there are many more. A
quick look at the calendar of UCLA's current ``Festival of
Preservation'' shows the Packard name on more than a dozen entries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Packard bought the film collection of the Silent Movie
Theatre on Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, most of it in 16mm, which
included prints of dozens of films that existed nowhere else.
Because paying labs is so expensive, and their schedules are so
tight, Packard decided to create his own preservation facility on
the grounds of UCLA. The facility is administered by UCLA
employees, who are paid indirectly by Packard's foundation through
the university.
</P>
<P>
   Packard's facility is a long, pristine room with a rather
beautiful black cast-iron machine in it. It looks as primitive as a
locomotive, but then the technology of motion pictures is
primitive. On the shelves are film cans with titles of obscure
silent films that are waiting to be seen again _ some for the first
time in more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a classical scholar by trade,'' Packard says. ``We can
read Homer and Plato because they were preserved by monks and
monasteries. Then in the Renaissance people discovered all this
stuff, and it was there. And it might not have been there. We can
read `The Iliad' and `The Odyssey,' but there were other Homeric
poems. We are at this period when a lot of the negatives aren't
going to survive forever. But at the right temperature and humidity
they'll last a lot longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent UCLA-Packard restorations include ``The Sensation
Seekers'' (1926) by director Lois Weber and ``Soul Fire'' (1925)
starring Richard Barthelmess.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Stanford Theatre's 75th anniversary was celebrated
with a screening of ``I'll Show You the Town,'' a Reginald Denny
comedy that played on the theater's opening night in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out that the only material for that title was in an
archive in Europe, with Dutch and French intertitles,'' says
Richmond. ``We paid them to bring the print over to UCLA for
preservation work. We got Universal to give us the continuity so we
could reproduce the English intertitles. I came up for the
screening. It was a nice evening, and there was a large, large
crowd.''

 CALL FOR WINGS IN THE CITY OF ANGELS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I return from Los Angeles with good news!
</P>
<P>
   People up here who say that traffic in the Bay Area is as bad as
traffic in L.A. are rum-soaked alarmists. Either that or they
haven't been to L.A. since '49.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Los Angeles, our traffic jams are pathetic and
scraggly. Our jams are cute, like a little kid dressing up in a
baseball uniform so he can look like a real big-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Rush hour in L.A. is 22 hours long. And sometimes it starts
early.
</P>
<P>
   The speediest driver in Los Angeles is Al Cowlings.
</P>
<P>
   And smog? One of these days the air in Los Angeles is going to
catch fire, and there's going to be trouble. You could make a
fortune in L.A. selling two-mile-high snorkels.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES is, however, a good place to drive your Ford
Explorer with the self-shredding Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding! After some research, I have determined that those
Firestone SUV tires that have reportedly caused dozens of deaths
are perfectly safe.
</P>
<P>
   If there really were a safety problem, the Firestone people
would establish a hotline that would be available to concerned
customers.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hotline, but it is always busy. And if you call the
Bridgestone-Firestone Technical Service Center, you are put on
permanent hold.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the danger is just not there, otherwise a responsible
and caring company like Firestone would spend enough money to
install enough lines and operators to talk to all concerned
customers.
</P>
<P>
   I BATTED .500 on my round trip to L.A., experiencing only one
flight cancellation on United Roulette.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellations are frustrating, but here's a travel tip: Do
 &UR; not  &LR; stow away in the wheel well of a jet.
</P>
<P>
   If you think conditions are cramped and service is lousy in
coach, you should sit in wheel well. The in-flight movie is your
life flashing before your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ONE MORE L.A. note:
</P>
<P>
   In Alhambra, a suburb about six miles east of downtown L.A.,
they've come up with a brilliant concept: traffic calming.
</P>
<P>
   It does not involve crop-dusters spritzing traffic jams with
Prozac mist, though that's an interesting concept.
</P>
<P>
   Due to an incomplete freeway nearby, a lot of commuters were
taking a daily shortcut through Alhambra, clogging that city's
traffic flow. Along the city's main roads, ``Traffic calming''
street signs are posted, as noted by reader Myles Lampenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   And to discourage this unwanted traffic, the City Council voted
to mess around with the timing of the traffic signals during rush
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Signals are set to give much less (not more) green-light time to
the short-cutters, making their jaunt through Alhambra, as one city
official told me, ``less of an enjoyable ride.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the ``Traffic calming'' is carried out by the city's
Dept. of Public Works, the director of which is Jim Funk.
</P>
<P>
   AND SPEAKING OF fine names, the Claremont Hotel is under fire
(so to speak) for its heavy-handed brush clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors call the project ``clear-cutting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Claremont's defense is presented by hotel manager Ted Axe.
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE tabbed Joe Lieberman as his running mate. Cynics say
this is a cheap attempt to disarm critics of the present
administration's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   To which loyal Dems scoff, ``What ethics?''
</P>
<P>
   As an optimistic Democrat, I prefer to look at it this way: Now
the ticket's integrity tank is half-full.
</P>
<P>
   But sadly, Gore overlooked the lesson the American public made
clear in the last three presidential elections: A clown as VP
really sells the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   --The agricultural region in Russia bordering Kazakhstan has
been hit with a 14-mile-long locust swarm. Would it be worth
diverting that swarm to the Napa Valley, to see if the locusts will
eat the glassy-winged sharpshooters?
</P>
<P>
   --Dick Armey told an off-color gay joke about Barney Frank, and
Armey's spokesperson Michelle Davis explained, ``It's a bad joke,
and he was just trying to get it over with.'' So shouldn't we send
all the bad, offensive and off-color jokes we can think of to Dick
Armey, so he can tell them at parties and get them all over with?

Democratic National Convention, canceled 14 flights at LAX and 226
worldwide on Tuesday amid pilot contract talks _ representing a
possible snag for the upcoming high-profile political event.
</P>
<P>
   Between Saturday and Tuesday, the airline reported at least
1,080 of its 2,400 daily flights worldwide had been canceled,
mostly due to bad weather and an increase in sick calls by pilots
who have vowed not to work overtime until a new contract is
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a sharp increase in the number of sick calls by pilots
over the weekend,'' said United spokesman Matthew Triaca, who said
the sick calls contributed to the cancellation of at least 14 of
210 scheduled flights at LAX.
</P>
<P>
   Triaca said the airline would take every precaution to ensure
negotiations don't upset next week's Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be fully staffed, and make every provision to
accommodate our customers,'' he said. ``We don't expect any
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ragone, a DNC spokesman, predicted the cancellations would
not affect the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, there has been no indication that the negotiations at
United are affecting the flight plans of those coming to town for
the convention,'' he said. ``We're hoping it stays that way.''
</P>
<P>
   United says its pilots have refused to work overtime since their
five-year contract expired April 12 and have increasingly called in
sick. But the pilots say there is no organized work slowdown and
problems are more the result of United's failure to hire enough
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Union spokesman Herb Hunter said there is no planned action to
disrupt the Democratic convention but couldn't promise hassle-free
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think United would want to have enough pilots and
flights available for the DNC, but that's up to them,'' Hunter
said. ``We don't know what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, United began canceling flights worldwide, eliminating
some 4,800 of its 70,000 monthly flights between May and August, a
trend connected to the negotiations, Triaca said.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, United President Rono Dutta apologized
to passengers for the inconvenience of the delayed and canceled
flights, which he said were exacerbated this past weekend by
disgruntled pilots and bad weather conditions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   United is offering for passengers who experienced flight
cancellations vouchers redeemable on competing airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues related to contract negotiations with our pilots were
compounded by severe thunderstorm activity in the Midwest and along
the East Coast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Burbank Airport on Tuesday, three scheduled United arrivals
were canceled, airport spokesman Victor Gill said. United makes up
about 15 percent of all flights in and out of Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of canceled flights accumulated, passengers at
Burbank Airport anxiously awaited news of rescheduled flights,
while others took the delays in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Murdock, 50, of Silverlake was a little nervous as he
counted the minutes until his scheduled departure for San Francisco
for a speaking engagement at a computer symposium of 100 people.
Because his 2:28 p.m. flight had been canceled, the airline gave
him the option of catching the next flight at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I have to figure out, OK, 15 minutes to get to the hotel,
15 minutes to change and freshen up, and then I have to get there,
and I'm the first speaker,'' Murdock said. ``I'm cutting it a
little close.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Rogers, 54, got his flight bumped two hours earlier. He
didn't mind. He was headed home to San Francisco from a student
loan conference in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to delays with United,'' he said while sitting in the
terminal, taking a break from reading the newspaper. ``But this
time, I got a flight two hours earlier _ if it leaves on time.''

 LIEBERMAN LAUDS GORE FOR `ACT OF CHUTZPAH'  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Evoking the memory of John Kennedy, the nation's
first Roman Catholic president, Vice President Al Gore said Tuesday
that Democrats are prepared to ``tear down an old wall of division
once again'' by nominating Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe and I come from different regions and different religious
faiths, but we believe in a common set of ideals,'' Gore said at a
rally in Nashville, Tenn., where he formally introduced Lieberman
as his choice for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew and the first non-Christian ever to
appear on either major party's presidential ticket, began his
remarks with a personal invocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Lord, maker of all miracles, I thank you for bringing me
to this extraordinary moment in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He then praised Gore for ``breaking this barrier for the rest of
America forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there are some people who might actually call Al's
selection of me an act of chutzpah,'' a smiling Lieberman said to
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman stood beside their wives in the broiling
Tennessee sunshine, taking off their jackets to reveal matching
white shirts dripping with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ticket was buoyed by news that the United Auto
Workers had decided to endorse their candidacy after months of
openly flirting with third-party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Union President Stephen P. Yokich said in a statement, ``It's no
secret that we disagree _ and disagree sharply. ... Yet even on
trade, where we don't see eye-to-eye, Al Gore is better, much
better, than George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   An overnight CNN/Gallup poll, which had Bush ahead of Gore by a
double-digit margin earlier this week, suddenly showed the race had
tightened to a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's reputation for moral rectitude and nonpartisan
behavior is making him a difficult target for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised Lieberman for his ``convictions, his strong faith''
and his positions on Social Security, missile defenses and school
vouchers. Like the Texas governor, Lieberman has expressed support
for private investment of Social Security funds, investment in a
missile defense system and school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This selection now presents the vice president with an
interesting test of whether he will continue attacking positions
his running mate shares or whether he will lift up our nation by
elevating the tone of his presidential campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Gore Tuesday, Lieberman ridiculed the notion
that he could be mistaken for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect,'' Lieberman said to laughs, ``I think
that's like saying that the veterinarian and the taxidermist are in
the same business because either way, you get your dog back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman borrowed a line that then Vice President George Bush,
father of the GOP nominee, used during his 1988 campaign against
Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to change horses in midstream, doesn't it make
sense to get the one that's going in the right direction?''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Lieberman ever mentioned President Clinton
during the 45-minute-long rally.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman wasted no time trying to leverage his reputation for
integrity to bolster Gore's standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership is not just another word, it means something. It
requires courage. It requires character,'' Lieberman said. ``And I
stand here today and say to you from personal experience that Al
Gore has both.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman called Gore ``a man of family and a man of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never wavered in his responsibilities as a father, as a
husband and, yes, as a servant of God Almighty,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   It is his ability to deliver such an endorsement that made
Lieberman an attractive candidate to Gore, who is under attack from
Republicans for being too closely associated with Clinton and eight
years of White House scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican convention really focused attention on the need
for something other than a third term for Clinton-Gore,'' said
Democrat Geraldine Ferraro, whose selection as Walter Mondale's
running mate in 1984 also made history.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was preceded to the podium by his wife, Hadassah, who
was born to Holocaust survivors in Czechoslovakia and emigrated to
the United States when she was 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you and your family immigrated from Europe, Africa,
Mexico, Latin America or Asia, I am standing here for you,'' she
said. ``This country is our country.''

RISING NATURAL GAS PRICES BAFFLE INDUSTRY ANALYSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A budding debate within the natural gas
industry is raising questions about why prices have more than
doubled since last November.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest groups to weigh in, the American Gas
Association, had expected some price increases as an incentive to
boost gas production. But it didn't expect _ nor did many others _
the steep run-up of recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The gas association also is skeptical about some of the reasons
cited to explain the boost, especially the explanation that
electric utilities are increasing their use of gas to produce
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is out of balance,'' said Paul Wilkinson, the gas
association's vice president of policy.
</P>
<P>
   This week wholesale gas prices have been about $4.50 per
thousand cubic feet, compared with $2 last November. Wholesale
prices are passed on directly to consumers, and if current prices
hold up, they would cost an average household an additional $200 to
$300 this winter. Nationwide, the additional cost to residential
customers could top $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even if gas prices fall, consumers will still be hit with higher
bills because utilities have been buying and storing some of the
gas that will be used in the winter. And it's not just households
who can expect higher bills. Commercial customers are preparing,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budgets are going up to meet the extra cost,'' said Jim
Zakoura, an attorney for Kansas Industrial Consumers, an
association of large commercial users of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about why prices are up have mainly been raised within
the natural gas industry. But that's likely to change as winter
approaches and higher heating bills start hitting mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are valid questions,'' said David Sommerer, head of the
Missouri Public Service Commission's gas procurement division.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts have zeroed in on several areas. Traders have been
using the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers as
evidence that utilities will have trouble meeting demand this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Though stockpiles are running slightly behind, there will be
sufficient gas in storage by winter, says the gas association.
Nevertheless, the storage numbers have caused gas prices to swing
as much as 20 percent in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, and nobody (who's in the market buying gas)
likes it,'' said Michael Eichenberg, president of Mountain Energy,
a Kansas City marketer of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   But among the reasons given in recent months for the price
increases, perhaps none has baffled observers as much as the one
involving electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas prices began to increase in earnest in May on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, where contracts for future delivery
of natural gas are bought and sold. The futures market is widely
followed by the natural gas industry and is influential in setting
wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were keeping an eye on temperatures across the country.
Bloomberg Business News asked a trader why prices were up that day.
The answer: It was going to get hot.
</P>
<P>
   Electric utilities were adding more generation to handle peak
days of demand, and most of it was going to be powered by natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Van Cleve, a trader with TW Energy Consultants in the
Kansas City area, recalls seeing accounts about the gas-fired
generation coming into operations and how that would increase
demand for natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen plenty of stories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the federal Energy Information Administration was taking
seriously the effect of electric utilities on gas use and price. In
its energy outlook for July, it singled out electric utilities as
the reason behind the higher gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   But others were puzzled by the assertion. The energy
administration's own estimates showed electric utility consumption
of gas would be flat this year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, any numbers on electric utility consumption of natural
gas are difficult to find, said Wilkinson of the gas association.
Nevertheless, the natural gas markets responded to fears that the
demand from electric utilities would stretch supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helped create a crisis mentality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That traders were overplaying the electric utility angle was
also the point of a study by Energy Security Analysis, an
independent energy research group in Wakefield, Mass. It looked at
how much gas-fired generation was coming on line and, taking into
account the weather, how much natural gas would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Its conclusion: a modest increase in overall demand. It
estimated that there was a 1 percent increase in the draw on
natural gas supplies by the electric utilities that was more than
balanced by weakness in other areas of demand for natural gas. The
research group questioned whether there was support for today's
high prices.
</P>
<P>
   If the assessment is true, can consumers expect prices to
eventually get back down to $2 or below? Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Eliason, vice president of gas strategy for Kansas Gas
Service, said there were sound reasons for prices not to return to
those levels. When prices sank below $2, producers scaled back
production of extra gas _ and supplies tightened up.
</P>
<P>
   His estimate is that wholesale prices between $2.50 and $3 per
thousand cubic feet will be sufficient incentive for producers to
meet future demand. Although that doesn't mean that the markets
won't deliver some price shocks along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's emotion in today's (gas markets),'' he said.

VALDES WORKS ON COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers pitching coach Claude Osteen
inserted a videotape and watched how right-hander Ismael Valdes
pitched in 1995 compared to now. He said there is no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Osteen also said early-season shoulder problems is likely the
biggest contributing factor as to why Valdes pitched poorly this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he picked some bad habits, probably when he had that
lame shoulder earlier in the season,'' Osteen said. ``He brought me
his `95 tape, and one from Chicago, and there's a world of
difference in the two deliveries, mechanically. He's dropping the
hands and not getting his front side ready at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers are to remain in contention for the playoffs,
Valdes, reacquired two weeks ago from the Chicago Cubs, needs to be
a big part of it.
</P>
<P>
   However, he was 2-4 with a 5.37 ERA in 12 starts for the Cubs
during an injury-laden season, and all the good that came from the
four strong innings against Pittsburgh in his Dodgers return was
wiped away by the atrocious Sunday outing. Milwaukee, the worst
hitting team in the National League, pounded him for seven runs in
1 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``His front side, I don't know if he ever got ready, but he was
way out there, and (his body) crossed the rubber way too quick
before he ever had a chance to get ready to throw,'' Osteen said.
``The end result is you can't get your backside through the pitch
to finish the pitch, and give you the power that's there. You can
have all the power in the world, but if you can't get it through,
and that's what we're trying to address.''
</P>
<P>
   Osteen and Valdes did a walk-through in the bullpen Monday to
discuss Valdes' mechanical flaws, and Valdes went through a bullpen
session Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got things quite a bit closer to where they should be,''
Osteen said. ``All I'm trying to do is give him a chance to be the
pitcher I know he is. He's got outstanding control, but when all
those parts aren't working in unison, it throws everything out of
kilter.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Devo starts: With the Cubs starting lefty Phil Norton, Devon
White started and batted leadoff for the Dodgers. It marked the
first time since the first game of a doubleheader last Tuesday at
Pittsburgh, which was the first game Tom Goodwin was available,
that White has started and led off.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier in the day, White spoke with general manager Kevin
Malone about his role since the acquisition of Goodwin. White had
wondered why the front office hadn't approached him about his role.
Malone spoke again Tuesday with White's agent, Eric Goldschmidt,
about how White fits into the Dodgers' plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reiterated that we're very glad Devo's back, we really
missed him in the first half when he was hurt, and now we have
(five) quality outfielders for three spots, and now we can give
guys rest and use everybody,'' Malone said. ``We're not replacing
Devo. We're just adding an outfielder with speed.''
</P>
<P>
   AS manager Davey Johnson explained a day earlier, Malone said
White would be used like a fourth outfielder, getting most of his
starts against left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Because of Thursday's off day, the Dodgers'
starting rotation is being juggled. Chan Ho Park goes Friday in
Atlanta, and he'll likely be followed by Valdes and Darren
Dreifort. Kevin Brown is slated to pitch Monday in Florida followed
by Matt Herges and Park. . . . Right fielder Shawn Green usually
hits third against left-handers, but he was dropped to fifth in the
batting order against Norton. Green's batting .192 since July 1.
First baseman Eric Karros, who usually hits fifth, moved into the
fourth spot.

KANSAS CITY RESIDENTS TURN DOWN CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For a third time since 1990, Kansas City
voters on Tuesday rejected a citywide curbside recycling program,
this time by a ratio of 54 percent to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although winning in precincts along the state line from downtown
to the Waldo neighborhood, the measure failed everywhere else.
Still, proponents pledged Tuesday to keep pushing for a different
way to pay for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to give up on curbside recycling,'' said Bob
Mann, leader of Citizens for Recycling. ``We're going to look for
other options.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote with more than 97% of precincts reporting: Yes 22,410,
No 26,250
</P>
<P>
   City leaders should be persuaded to find a way to start curbside
recycling because the election results show a large percentage of
Kansas City residents are willing to pay for it, Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe we'll have curbside recycling in the next
three years,'' he said. ``I really believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the precincts supporting the measure Tuesday already pay
for curbside recycling through homes associations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the program's opponents have made clear they are not
against recycling, but they object to forcing everyone, including
senior citizens on fixed incomes, to pay the $1.95 monthly fee for
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kansas Citians favor recycling overwhelmingly,'' said
Mark Bryant, president of Freedom Inc., a political club
influential in the black community. ``But they disagreed with the
finance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think it's time for the proponents to get the message
on the financing plan and find alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City proposal would have included single-family and
duplex households _ about 133,000. They would have paid the monthly
fee with their water bills. Apartment buildings of up to six units
could have subscribed voluntarily. Trash service would not have
been affected.
</P>
<P>
   The materials proposed for collection: all paper other than
tissue and wax-coated, including cardboard, magazines, catalogs,
junk mail and newspaper; No. 1 and No. 2 plastic items; steel cans;
and aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Proposition 2 on the ballot, each household
would have received a bin for paper and a second for the other
materials. Each bin would have been collected at the curb on
alternating weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The program and the $1.95 monthly charge were to start in late
winter or early spring. The proposal would have required the city
to seek voter approval if it ever wanted to charge more than $2.50
per month.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign on behalf of the proposal was low-key, relying on a
network of avid recyclers built over the last decade by Bridging
the Gap. The group was formed after the 1992 defeat of curbside
recycling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, voters also rejected curbside recycling, but this year
Mann hoped that a large network of volunteers who regularly showed
up at community drop-off centers would go to the polls Tuesday to
carry the recycling proposal to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's group also has begun a statewide Environmental Excellence
Campaign, to which 25,000 individuals have subscribed. He hoped
those supporters also would push the proposal beyond its past
problems at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat Tuesday left Kansas City among just a few major U.S.
cities without curbside recycling, but Mann said the city's
environmental ethic has improved greatly since voters rejected the
program in the early 1990s. What's more, Kansas City doesn't
deserve the anti-recycling image created by the voter rejections of
recycling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't deserve that reputation,'' Mann said. ``Overland Park
never had to vote on it. Would (nearby) Overland Park (Kan.) have
passed it eight years ago? I don't know. But certainly other cities
would have voted it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann added that recycling proponents had much to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only city in America that has to deal with the
earnings tax, the Hancock Amendment and free trash service,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, city leaders promised to use the earnings tax to pay
for trash services. Missouri's Hancock Amendment requires voter
approval of fees and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the defeat, city officials will examine how to
adjust the city's existing recycling service _ a system of drop-off
centers, most of them open only on weekends, said John Stufflebean,
who directs the city's environmental management office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do a comprehensive look at where we'll go with
recycling over the next five years,'' Stufflebean said.

SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PAY $72,500 TO FORMER STUDENT IN HARASSMENT
CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Pleasant Hill Public School District has
agreed to pay $72,500 to a former student who alleged he was
sexually harassed by other students who thought he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   The district also has agreed with the U.S. Justice Department to
establish a two-year program to ``prevent, identify and remediate
harassment and discrimination'' on the basis of sex or sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and others said the program
required by the settlement appeared to be the first in the nation
authorized to protect students based on their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first intervention that we're aware of and it's very
important,'' said Patricia Logue, supervising attorney for the
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund's Midwest office in
Chicago. ``It really makes clear how much abuse is targeted at gay
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lambda fund works for the rights of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Patterson, the attorney representing the former student,
said his client was happy with the settlement of the year-old civil
rights lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased the school district will make a commitment in
the future to prevent any sort of harassment and ensure this sort
of thing doesn't happen again,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing the school district noted that, in
agreeing to the settlement, school officials acknowledged no
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this transpired before we had a new school board,
superintendent and administration,'' said Thomas Mickes of St.
Louis. ``They looked at this and said we've got some good legal
arguments. But whether or not it technically violates the law,
everybody deserves to go to school in an environment free of
teasing or harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, the student contended that he was sexually
harassed by his classmates, who incorrectly thought he was gay.
Furthermore, the student alleged that Pleasant Hill administrators
knew of the harassment, but did nothing to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The student said the harassment stretched over four years,
beginning in 1994 when he was 14. The lawsuit alleged the boy was
called names in the school cafeteria and corridors, beaten and
nearly run over by a car driven by two classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Before the settlement, district officials argued they had taken
reasonable steps to stop the harassment when they learned of it.
</P>
<P>
   The order, signed July 31 by U.S. District Judge Fernando Gaitan
Jr., followed an earlier decision by the Justice Department last
month to join the case on the student's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement, the district agreed to hire consultants to
prepare a plan to identify and eliminate discrimination and
harassment based on sex or sexual orientation within the district.
</P>
<P>
   That plan will include regular reports to the Justice
Department, written procedures and standards, training for school
staff members and development of a student curriculum on
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the order, the district will remain under federal
scrutiny until September 2002, assuming the Justice Department does
not file for an extension of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was among the first filed in Kansas City last year
after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling opened the door to actions based
on student-on-student sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   A similar lawsuit filed on behalf of a girl in the Richmond
(Mo.) School District settled recently for $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed with the settlement, the district also
denied any liability or wrongdoing.

MEDIA ATTENTION SUBSIDES AT KANSAS BOARD OF EDUCATION MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, 60 persons addressed the Kansas Board of Education,
and journalists and cameras packed the board room for two days as
the board discussed and voted on science standards that would
downplay evolution.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the cameras were gone. Three speakers came forward.
One addressed the science standards, which appear to be on the way
out.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is not going to die or become extinct,'' Judy
Smith, state director of Concerned Women for America, a
conservative group, told the board. ``Because of the attention
those promoting evolution have given it, this issue now has a life
of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith criticized recent promises made by moderate Republicans
and Democrats running for the state board to rewrite the science
standards, which do not include references to the age of the earth,
the big-bang theory of the universe's origin and some aspects of
evolutionary theory.
</P>
<P>
   The standards are guidelines for what Kansas students should
learn and are tested on. The state board, which oversees the
state's 304 school districts, voted 6-4 a year ago to approve them.
Five conservatives and a moderate backed the standards; four
moderates voted against them.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on evolution _ the theory that living things share
common ancestors but have changed over time _ reinvigorated the
longstanding debate over science and religion. The six board
members who voted to downplay evolution cited, in part, their
hesitation to include information that would go against some
students' religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives Linda Holloway of Shawnee and Mary Douglass Brown
of Wichita _ two of the six members who supported the standards _
lost re-election bids in the Republican primary a week ago. A third
conservative, Abilene farmer Scott Hill, resigned his seat in July.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's successor, Salina lawyer Bruce Wyatt, was appointed by
Gov. Bill Graves on Monday and sworn in. Wyatt began his tenure at
Tuesday's meeting. He said on a break that if he won his Nov. 7
race against Democrat Eloise Lynch of Salina, he would make a
motion in January to reopen debate over the science standards.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt and other candidates want to bring back a set of
standards, written by a 27-member committee of science teachers and
professors, that lists evolution as a concept unifying all
scientific disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe evolution should be included in the science
standards, because it is the consensus of the worldwide scientific
community,'' Wyatt said.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Loren Lutes and John Staver have been saying all
along. On Tuesday the co-chairmen of the 27-member committee sat
silently in the back of the board room. They said later that they
had begun working on a sixth draft of their committee's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Lutes, superintendent of the Oskaloosa School District, and
Staver, a science education professor at Kansas State University,
say they had learned much in the last year that would make their
next set of standards better.
</P>
<P>
   ``As science educators, we were not as careful to make sure that
people learned the difference between science and beliefs,'' Lutes
said. ``And we're dedicated to doing a better job.''

CLINTON'S VETO LOGIC A BIT FLAWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: President Clinton's explanation for his opposition to
tax relief for married couples seems to contradict conventional
politicoeconomic wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   When he vetoed legislation designed to give married couples an
election-year income tax break, he said giving the tax break would
undermine the fiscal discipline responsible for sustaining what has
been a record economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   This reasoning, however, runs counter to long-held Keynesian
orthodoxy among Democrats that governments can best stimulate
economic growth by getting money into the hands of the public to
spur consumption. It's called pump-priming and even the Republicans
embraced their version of the concept by turning to supply-side
economics. Supply-siders believe lower taxes encourage productive
behavior, but ultimately the same goal is served by encouraging
consumer activity.
</P>
<P>
   What is even more curious about the president's position is that
he has indicated a willingness to go along with the GOP bid to end
the marriage penalty in return for support of his proposal to
implement a Medicare prescription drug benefit. The Republicans
aren't buying the proffered quid pro quo, though, because they have
their own drug benefit plan, which is less expansive.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what anyone thinks of the idea of government
helping seniors with prescription costs, adding this entitlement to
Medicare will certainly cost as much over time as the revenue hit
Uncle Sam would take if the marriage penalty is ended. This reality
implies the president is being less than forthright when explaining
his motives for opposing the GOP on the marriage penalty issue.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of President Clinton's characterization
of marriage penalty relief as a ``tax giveaway.'' This, of course,
hews to the mindset that Washington should have first claim to the
fruits of the citizenry's labor even if it doesn't need all the
resources it's claiming.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is reaping record amounts of revenue,
thanks to a booming economy and two substantial tax increases
during the past decade. The surpluses it boasts aren't budget
surpluses, as claimed, but tax surpluses that rightfully belong to
the taxpayers who made them possible.
</P>
<P>
   Although these surpluses are supposed to be sacrosanct in the
name of financing great future initiatives, they really don't
exist. If you believe they do, ask somebody in the federal
government to show you the account designated ``surplus revenue to
be used later to pay for great stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   They can't because in the scheme of federal finance money comes
in and money goes out. Since it can't be saved, it gets spent.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were a mechanism by which extra revenue could be
saved, it wouldn't be saved in the sense we understand the concept
because politicians will spend every cent available to them. Most
politicians are hard-wired to tax away all the revenue they can
squeeze from taxpayers. The most talented are masters at plucking
the goose without causing a lot of undue hissing on the part of the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the GOP is indeed playing an election-year game with
its tax-cut campaign? If this is what it takes for taxpayers to get
a fair shake from Washington, it's worth it.

MENDED MERCKER MAKES WAY BACK INTO ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When pitcher Kent Mercker learned that he had
suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on the Edison Field mound May 11, he
didn't know if he'd live long enough to see his children graduate
from high school, let alone if he'd ever pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercker is back _ he will start Saturday's game for the
Anaheim Angels against the New York Yankees at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's going to be an emotional day for me,'' he
said. ``I got pumped up pitching in my rehab assignment, but that's
not the same as taking the mound in a major-league game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker underwent days of tests immediately following the
hemorrhage, and doctors concluded it was caused by a blood vessel
that burst and disintegrated. There was no malformation of blood
vessels, no aneurysm and therefore virtually no chance of another
hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   But until that determination was made, Mercker had to live with
the thought that his life was in immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you definitely think that,'' he said. ``They tell you
your brain's bleeding and they don't know why. If they do the tests
oblem that it could happen again. But they came back and told me
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker will take the mound three months and one day after the
incident, but it is sooner than the Angels had planned. Mercker was
supposed to make a second rehab start tonight, but because Angels
pitchers are dropping faster than even they are used to, there was
a need for the quick return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's ready to take on the challenge of competing at
the major-league level,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``We'd like
to get upwards of 80 pitches from him, and that should be enough to
get him deep enough into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   !tvspt2!Moving day: Monday was a day of many changes for the
pitching staff. Ken Hill was released and Brian Cooper was sent to
Triple-A Edmonton. Ramon Ortiz was called up. Jarrod Washburn was
activated from the disabled list before the game, then placed back
on the disabled list after the game.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Angels short a pitcher Tuesday. But instead of
calling up another pitcher, they called up outfielder/first baseman
Chris Hatcher. Hatcher, who was acquired by the Angels from the
Cubs in a trade July 28, has a combined 26 home runs and 77 RBI
this season with Triple-A Iowa and Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels currently have a three-man starting rotation of
Ortiz, Matt Wise and Scott Schoeneweis. Mercker will be the fourth
starter when he is activated Saturday.

SERENA WILLIAMS NEEDS ONLY 38 MINUTES IN FIRST ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Any doubts about Serena Williams'
condition following a five-week layoff were officially vanquished
early in her first-round match against Ruxandra Dragomir at the
estyle.com Classic on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the tournament's defending champion who had not played
since Wimbledon, dominated all facets of the match and needed just
38 minutes to earn a 6-0, 6-1 victory at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really ready to play,'' Williams said. ``I was
practicing (Monday) and telling my dad how ready and eager I was to
get back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Dragomir, a 27-year-old Romanian, was a good
sport. The crowd cheered her on, presumably because they wanted
more than a half-hour of tennis for their admission fee, and
Dragomir obliged them by raising her left fist in the air after
winning her only game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only moment of levity for Dragomir, who could never
quite get the correct timing on Williams' powerful baseline strokes
and sent ball after ball sailing out of play.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Williams, however, she found something she could
improve on, which must be a terrifying thought to Dragomir and
Tamarine Tanasugarn, the qualifier who Williams will face this
afternoon in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I thought I could have played a lot better,''
Williams said. ``I could have served a lot better. My highest serve
was 110, and it's usually 118 or 119. I actually tried to hit it
hard, and I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who turns 19 next month, is using Manhattan Beach as a
tuneup for the U.S. Open, where she will attempt to defend her only
Grand Slam title. Other players might be concerned about building
some confidence and momentum after a long break, but not Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence is pretty much at the same level all the time,''
Williams said. ``I'm feeling pretty good about my game right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get back to playing like I did at
Wimbledon. Play quick and get off the court fast so I can focus on
my mental game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another youngster made a big impact Tuesday and pulled the first
upset of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Daja Bedanova, a 17-year-old from the Czech Republic in her
first year as a professional, recorded her first win over a top-10
player when she earned a 6-3, 6-4 victory over France's Nathalie
Tauziat, seeded sixth and ranked eighth in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bedanova's only previous experience against a top-10 player was
last year, when she lost to Venus Williams in Philadelphia. She
stayed in control of Tauziat for much of the match and had her
serve broken just once.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it was much better, but in the beginning I was very
nervous,'' said Bedanova, the youngest player at Manhattan Beach
this week.``I think I played some good games.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Frazier, who won the Manhattan Beach tournament in 1994,
started slowly but rallied to easily defeat qualifier Marlene
Weingartner of Germany, 7-6 (8-6), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier pulled off a stunning upset of top-seeded Martina Hingis
in last week's Acura Classic in Carlsbad but doesn't display much
of the confidence of a player on a hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been playing well, but I'm not sure that last
week or the past couple weeks have anything to do with this week,''
said Frazier, who will face Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the second
round. ``This tournament is so tough, it just feels good to get out
of the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   In other first-round matches, Sanchez-Vicario, the seventh seed,
defeated Barbara Schett of Austria 6-4, 6-1; eighth-seeded Sandrine
Testudof France beat Russia's Elena Likhovtseva, 6-2, 6-4;
qualifier Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand beat Spain's Magui Serna
6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 7-5; and Belgium's Dominique Van Roost beat Russian
qualifier Tatiana Panova 6-1, 6-2. American Lisa Raymond beat
Mirjana Lucic of Croatia 6-3, 6-3.

Casserly likes how The Replacements captures '87 strike
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN McCLAIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Replacements, the Keanu Reeves/Gene Hackman film
based on the 1987 NFL players strike, is bringing back a flood of
fond memories for Charley Casserly, general manager of Houston's
expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   The Replacements, which opens nationwide Friday, is based on the
Washington strike team that went 3-0 and helped pave the way for
the Joe Gibbs-coached Redskins to win Super Bowl XXII.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, it's the best football movie ever,'' Casserly
said after watching a special screening. ``In a four-star system,
I'd give it five stars _ four for the movie and one for Washington
beating Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bobby Beathard's assistant general manager with the Redskins
in 1987, Casserly was largely responsible for finding and signing
the replacement players who defeated the Rams, Giants and Cowboys
before the strike ended.
</P>
<P>
   As the general manager for owner Bob McNair's team, Casserly
will make the first pick in the 2002 draft. He is hoping a
franchise quarterback will be available, but he won't reach for
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Keanu Reeves will be a free agent,'' Casserly said. ``I
like his mechanics, arm strength and leadership ability, but I
don't know if we could fit him in our salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see. He got $11 million for the movie and had to play
only four games. That's $44 million for a regular season. I don't
know if even Bob McNair can afford that, but he'd be a great draw,
wouldn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Reeves replaces Houston native Brett Cullen, the $8
million-a-year superstar quarterback who leads his striking
teammates off the field and into the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   Hackman is a George Allen-type coach who had been fired by Jack
Warden, a Jack Kent Cooke-type owner. Warden convinces Hackman to
coach the replacement team.
</P>
<P>
   The producers had to follow strict guidelines. For legal
reasons, nowhere in advertisements, promotional material or the
film itself is there any mention of anything or anyone related to
the NFL. The team is called the Washington Sentinels. No color
schemes that had been used in the NFL within the last 10 years
could be used for players or cheerleaders in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran screenwriter Vince McKewin disclosed when filming began
a year ago at the Baltimore Ravens' PSINet Stadium that he was a
devoted Redskins fan who based much of his script on Washington's
team of replacement players. The brainchild behind the film was
producer Dylan Sellers, who came up with the idea when he was
bedridden with the flu and watching a television show about the
1987 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an unprecedented time in the NFL,'' Casserly said.
``Gibbs and his staff should get all the credit for doing a
marvelous coaching job. Joe and Bobby constantly preached to our
regular players to stay together _ to go out together or to come in
together. Gibbs stayed loyal to the regular players and did a
masterful job of walking down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the movie with some reservations, but I have to
admit that I thought it was great. A lot of what we went through
during that period is on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after the players went on strike, they picketed on
the street outside the facility and threw eggs and rocks at buses
bringing replacement players to their first practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one scene, a player cracks a window in a bus,'' Casserly
said. ``When that happened at our facility, one of our defensive
linemen, Darryl Grant (who played at Rice), actually stood in front
of a bus and forced it to stop. Then he smashed the window and
broke it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a couple of (replacement) players because of that.
They were afraid of more retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew that a strike was possible. We tried to prepare
by keeping close tabs on players we cut during camp and preseason
that season and the season before. We didn't go after big-name
players. We were careful to try to sign players familiar with
Gibbs' offensive system and (Richie) Petitbon's defensive system.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, whose 23-year career with the Redskins ended last year
when he was fired by owner Daniel Snyder, made two trips to the
film's location and was impressed with the football scenes and the
accuracy of the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those scenes brought back some great memories,''
Casserly said. ``In the movie, there's an offensive lineman who's
incredibly fat. I remember we signed one lineman who was so fat
I'll never forget what (offensive line coach) Joe Bugel told Gibbs.
He said, `Damn, Joe, when I reached out to show him how to use his
hands to block, my hand disappeared into his stomach.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In another scene, they sign a player out of prison. We
actually signed four from a halfway house. We had this safety from
Texas Tech (Charles Jackson). After our first night together, I
remember him saying, `I'm proud to represent the state of
Washington.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Linemen were the hardest players to find, especially on
offense. We were desperate. I called a coach at Cal
State-Northridge and asked him about one of his former players. The
coach said he was big and tough but didn't know what kind of shape
he was in.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time like that, big and tough was good enough for me. The
guy was student-teaching when we signed him. We didn't have time
for physicals. I remember he came to my second-floor office right
after he got there. He was huffing and puffing. I asked him if
they'd already had him on the treadmill or he'd been lifting
weights. When he was finally able to catch his breath, he said,
`Stairs,' and I thought, `Oh, my God.' But we signed him.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast of Hollywood characters compares with those in real
life. In The Replacements, there are offensive linemen so fat they
look as if they're going to explode; a super-fast wide receiver
with pitchfork hands; a maniacal middle linebacker; a European
kicker with a serious cigarette addiction; a born-again Christian;
and a deaf receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to constantly recruit players because so many left or
got hurt,'' Casserly said. ``Everyone was desperate for players.
Our drug test consisted of just asking them if they used any drugs.
It's just amazing what teams were going through.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the team recruits replacement cheerleaders. Because
of a shortage, they're forced to hire a few strippers. There were
no replacement cheerleaders, but McKewin had to produce a love
interest for Reeves. Brooke Langton, who was on Melrose Place for
two years, co-stars as the head cheerleader who falls in love with
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the cheerleaders have one of the film's best scenes.
When the Sentinels are behind in one game, the cheerleaders do a
wicked routine to Donna Summer's Bad Girls, distracting the
opposing offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that impressed me the most when I visited
the set was how interested they were in what actually happened
during the strike,'' Casserly said. ``Hackman was such a class act,
a true professional. In the movie, he's got total control, just
like George Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one scene where he's making a speech to motivate his
players. I remember Gibbs telling them the same thing. It was
before our last strike game at Dallas. Everyone knew the strike was
ending after that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe told them something like, `Men, it's a cliche to say
there's no tomorrow, but for you guys, there really is no tomorrow.
All of you wanted a second chance. Well, what more could you ask
for in a second chance? The Dallas Cowboys on Monday Night Football
in Texas Stadium.' And you know what? They went out and beat the
Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had many of their regular players, including Tony
Dorsett, Randy White, Danny White and Ed ``Too Tall'' Jones, cross
the picket line before the Redskins game. The Redskins were
lopsided underdogs but pulled out a 13-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, the Cowboys' minds weren't on that game,''
Casserly said. ``With all the attention given to players crossing
the picket line, I think they were pretty distracted. We got a
couple of big hits early on `Too Tall' and Randy White, and they
were never the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, it's kind of funny because (former Cowboys
general manager) Tex Schramm is the one who came up with the idea
for replacement players before the season. Our replacement players
beat his regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, though, our guys were going to come in, too, before
that game. The league rule said players had to come in no later
than Wednesday to be eligible to play that Sunday. Because the game
was on Monday, our guys thought they could wait until Thursday, and
the league said no, so they had to stay out.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, his wife, Bev, and daughter, Shannon, were in the
dressing room when one bonding scene was shot with the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone treated us great,'' Casserly said. ``Reeves was a
super guy. He had (former NFL quarterback) T.J. Rubley helping him,
and he looked the part. Hey, the football scenes were outstanding.
They had a guy (Allan Graf) who's handled the football action
scenes in a lot of movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I hope the movie does well, because they put a lot
of time, money and effort into making it as realistic as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for their replacement team, the Redskins might not have
reached the Super Bowl. They won the NFC East with an 11-4 record.
They played at Chicago in the second round of the playoffs and
upset the Bears. The Redskins hosted the NFC Championship Game and
beat Minnesota, a wild-card team that had upset New Orleans and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins then defeated Denver 42-10 in Super Bowl XXII. The
replacement players each received a half share of $32,000 for their
contributions to the Super Bowl-winning season.

U.S. OLYMPIC MEN'S TEAM SEARCHES FOR GOLDEN GOALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the Sydney Olympics will be about soccer stars Mia Hamm,
Brandi Chastain, Julie Foudy and the rest of the bunch that
captured the Women's World Cup last summer and the 1996 Olympic
Gold medal in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has made the U.S. women's team a focal point of its summer
marketing campaign and fall schedule, but what about men's soccer?
There will be a U.S. men's soccer team in Sydney and the men dream
just as big.
</P>
<P>
   In his wildest fantasy, Galaxy midfielder Peter Vagenas will
return from the Olympics sport ing a shiny gold medal and a small
request for Jay Leno, who undoubtedly will leave a number of phone
messages for the Pasadena resident to visit the ``Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I should probably start setting it up now, don't you think?''
joked Vagenas, expected to be named a starter for the U.S. Under-23
Olympic Team along with Galaxy teammates Danny Califf and Sasha
Victorine when the roster is unveiled on Aug. 15. ``Maybe I'll call
Jay and say, `Jay, if we win the gold medal, can I be on with Elle
McPherson? Think that's asking too much?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   But asking the men to win a gold medal in soccer? That would
draw more laughs than Leno's monologue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no pressure on us, everyone will be focused on our
women because they're the defending Olympic and World champions,''
said Califf. ``And realistically, our chances aren't that great.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. opens group play against the Czech Republic Sept. 13,
followed by games against Cameroon and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   All the U.S. team needs to do is finish in the top two in group
play to reach the single-elimination quarterfinals. But for those
keeping score, the U.S. has never escaped group play in the
Olympics. In fact, from 1924 to 1996, the U.S. team has a combined
4-12-6 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying it will be easy, but if we can get to the
second round (quarterfinals), who knows?'' said Califf. ``We could
get a good draw or pull off an upset and all of a sudden we would
be in the semifinals serving notice around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning it all, of course, would be just as remarkable as the
1980 U.S. hockey team cap turing the gold in Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an unbelievable story and a great opportunity for
the young players like myself to leave a mark,'' said Califf. ``But
that's just dreaming, we have three games to play first.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the U.S. has virtually no chance of winning the gold,
but being in a group with Cameroon and Kuwait gives the Americans a
chance to reach the quarterfinals for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that, but we're not going over there to reach the
second round,'' said Vagenas. ``We want a medal; anything less
would be a huge disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Clive Charles will name the 18-man roster for the Olympics
next week. Victorine said there is plenty riding on the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do well in the Olympics, this changes a lot of our
careers because we will be seen overseas,'' said Victorine. ``It
also changes our lives here. The Olympics will make us bigger
personalities. That's what the Olympics can do for you.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, though, it's a chance for men's soccer to
erase the memories of the 1998 World Cup in France. The U.S. team
finished last among the 32 teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Soccer has said it hopes to make a big impact on the
world stage in the next 10 to 15 years,'' said Victorine. ``This is
our first big stage during that span. We're capable of making
noise, we just have to go out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer teams have turned the U.S. Open Cup into a
possible preview of the MLS Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the A-League's Rochester Rhinos beat Colorado to
capture America's oldest soccer championship. This year, however,
all eight quarterfinal teams hail from MLS.
</P>
<P>
   All eight play tonight, with the Galaxy hosting the San Jose
Earthquakes at Cal State Fullerton at 7:30.

not a first choice for those looking to reap great harvests. For
almost a century, however, farms large and small have done just
that. Sandwiched between showy Atlantic City and stately
Philadelphia, this part of South Jersey is prime blueberry country.
The lean, sandy and acidic soil here puts forth about 40 million
pounds of the tender fruit, enough to make the state second only to
Michigan in blueberry production. This summer's consistent,

DREIFORT HITS TWO HOMES IN DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since the All-Star break, Darren Dreifort's done
it with his right arm, winning his first four starts and
re-establishing himself as a force in the Los Angeles Dodgers'
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   He did pretty well in his fifth start, too, but no one really is
going to remember his 6 effective innings Tuesday against the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the ever-lasting memory will be the pair of homers
Dreifort hit _ measuring a combined 903 feet _ as the Dodgers hit a
season high five home runs and led the Cubs 7-5 entering the bottom
of the eighth inning at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield broke his tie with the Cubs' Sammy Sosa for the
major league-lead in homers, hitting his 36th of the season in the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort became the first pitcher to hit two homers in a game
since Atlanta's Derek Lilliquist did it May 1, 1990, against the
Mets. Dreifort also became the first Dodgers pitcher to hit two
homers in a game since Don Drysdale did it Aug. 23, 1958, against
the Milwaukee Braves at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   His first shot was a 441-foot blast near the edge of the
right-field bleachers in the fourth inning. Dreifort's other homer
was a 462-foot blast into the left-center field bleachers in the
fifth inning. His chance for a third homer went by the boards when
he struck out i inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's three homers this season are the most by a pitcher
since Fernando Valenzuela hit three in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Dreifort's never been a slouch with the bat. During
his All-American career at Wichita State, he batted .318 with 25
homers and 89 RBI in 314 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Dreifort also pitched a doozy of a game to improve to
9-7, including 5-0 since the All-Star break. In allowing two earned
runs on six hits, he kept his post-All-Star break ERA at 2.67.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed three runs (one earned) in the third inning,
but it shouldn't have been the case.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out, Sosa grounded to
shortstop Kevin Elster for what should have been a perfect double
play. But Elster's flip to Mark Grudzielanek was wide of second and
rolled to the wall adjacent the Cubs' dugout, allowing pitcher Phil
Norton and Ricky Gutierrez to score. Mark Grace added an RBI single
to put 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Elster, starting because the lefty Norton (0-1) was pitching,
got one of the runs back with a solo homer in the fourth inning. It
turned out to be the first of four the Dodgers hit in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later Dreifort followed with his first of the night
to tie it 3-3. Devon White grounded out and Grudzielanek flied out,
but Sheffield retook the major league lead and gave the Dodgers a
4-3 lead with his solo homer. Eric Karros singled to left and Shawn
Green hit Norton's 1-0 pitch over the right field fence for a 6-3
Dodgers lead.
</P>
<P>
   The four homers in the inning allowed by Norton, making his
second major league start, tied a major league record. It was the
18th time the dubious feat was accomplished, the last being St.
Louis' Andy Benes last month against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' five homers were also the most they've hit in a
game since belting six at Colorado on Sept. 26, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even with the homers and the offense and the fun the fans
had watching Dreifort make like Sheffield or Sosa, a hair-raising
moment came inthe top of the seventh. Cubs center fielder Gary
Matthews Jr. lined a ball off the heal of Dreifort's glove,
apparently glancing off his left wrist. It sent shivers through the
Dodgers, but Dreifort remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   However, he wasn't out of trouble. Eric Young grounded out to
third, Gutierrez walked and Sosa struck out. But Mark Grace singled
to score Matthews Jr. and pull the Cubs to within 7-4. Mike Fetters
relieved and got Rondell White to end the inning, but allowed a
two-out solo homer to Jeff Reed in the eighth.

ANGELS GET PAST BOSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia and
pitching coach Bud Black couldn't emphasize it enough during spring
training _ please, please don't compare 24-year-old Ramon Ortiz to
Boston Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia and Black might find that a little more difficult to
do, now that the Angels' pitcher has beaten his mentor, throwing a
complete-game two-hitter to beat the Red Sox, 2-1, Tuesday night
before 27,293 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz had thrown 100 pitches entering the ninth and had to face
the Red Sox's Nos. 2, 3 and 4 hitters. He got Jason Varitek on a
popup to the catcher. Nomar Garciaparra grounded out to first and
Carl Everett popped to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, I don't believe it,'' Ortiz said after the game.
``He's my idol. Today was the greatest day of my life. I still
can't believe I won the game. ... I just felt very proud to be
facing him. I was pitching against the best pitcher in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that prevented Ortiz (4-2) from throwing a
shutout was a bad call from second base umpire Mike Fichter. Troy
O'Leary led off the fifth inning with a liner off the wall in right
field. But right fielder Orlando Palmeiro played the carom off the
wall perfectly and fired to shortstop Benji Gil.
</P>
<P>
   The throw was a few feet up the line, but it seemed to catch
O'Leary off guard. He went in standing up, but not before Gil
tagged him on the rear as he went by. Fichter, however, called
O'Leary safe.
</P>
<P>
   A groundout to second by Brian Daubach got O'Leary to third, and
Ed Sprague's grounder to second scored O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the Red Sox scored their run, Ortiz maintained
the composure the Angels have been looking for. He needed that
composure again in the seventh when center fielder Garret Anderson
dropped a routine fly ball from O'Leary with one out, allowing
O'Leary to take second. After a visit from catcher Bengie Molina,
Ortiz got the next two hitters to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him, `He made an error, try to pick him up,' ''
Molina said. ``Don't let the run score. Not only for the team, but
for Garret. He feels bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz has spent most of this season in the minors because he has
lacked that composure, particularly during tough situations. And
there could not have been a more difficult task than pitching
against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Molina has taken on the chore of trying to keep Ortiz's emotions
under control, but he said Tuesday he didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to do anything tonight,'' Molina said. ``He did
it on his own. He was very calm. When he struck out Sprague (in the
sixth) was the only time he got excited, the only time in the game
I told him to calm down. ... I was very surprised because I know
the kind of game it was for him. I think he was trying to copy
Pedro, the way Pedro works.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked, even if it disappointed a season-high
walk-up crowd of 6,798 that came to see Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might have come to see Pedro tonight,'' Scioscia said.
``But they're coming back to see Ramon.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (13-4) pitched a typical game. He allowed only three
baserunners _ a solo homer by Tim Salmon in the second and singles
by Palmeiro and Anderson in the fourth. Anderson's two-out single
on a 1-2 pitch drove in Palmeiro from second with the decisive run.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out nine and walked none; Ortiz struck out six
and walked two. The two pitchers have been compared because they
are both from the Dominican Republic and have similar throwing
styles.
</P>
<P>
   As Ortiz took the mound to start the ninth, he said a prayer,
then looked into the Angels bullpen and saw nobody warming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went out for the ninth inning, I said `Help me God,
help me really bear down and pitch,' '' Ortiz said. ''I was very
emotional when Troy Glaus caught the ball for the last out of the
game. I went crazy. I started to jump like a little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz said he shared a hug with Martinez before the game, then
watched him pitch from the dugout during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole game, I watched him the whole game,'' Ortiz said.
''Ever game he pitches, on TV too.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Martinez: ''I'm glad I was here for his day.''

YANKEES STUN ATHLETICS, 4-3

<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Justice remembers hitting the ball in the
bottom of the ninth inning on Tuesday night. He remembers touching
second base, and the two girls happily running onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it's a blur.
</P>
<P>
   It all happened so fast. Oakland led, 3-2, and the Athletics'
closer, Jason Isringhausen, jogged in from the bullpen to pitch the
Yankee ninth, and threw exactly two pitches, two fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams hit the first for a game-tying home run, and
before Williams put away his equipment, Justice launched
Isringhausen's next pitch for a game-winning home run at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It happened so fast that the first time Williams sees a replay
of Justice's home run will be the first time he ever sees it.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches, two home runs; this is how the Yankees stunned
Oakland, 4-3, and prevented their losing streak from stretching to
four games. ``I've seen back-to-back home runs,'' said Derek Jeter,
the Yankees' shortstop. ``But not two pitches, bottom of the ninth,
game over.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens was in the trainers' room at the time. Before the
Yankees batted in the ninth, it appeared that all that remained of
his evening was a dunk of his arm in stinging ice water, and glum
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   He had pitched well for seven innings, but he allowed a freakish
inside-the-park two-run homer in the fifth when Eric Chavez's drive
hit the top of the center-field wall, bounced high into the air and
away from Williams. Clemens allowed a conventional home run to
Ramon Hernandez, the next batter. Back-to-back bombs, and Oakland
led, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee hitters could do nothing against Barry Zito, the
Oakland starter, a young left-hander who seems destined for great
things. He has a prominent birthmark on his left wrist, and when he
was young, he asked his mother why it was there. Because your left
hand is going to be special, she replied, and his mother was right.
</P>
<P>
   Zito is one of the few left-handers who throws a true curveball,
and he really confused the Yankees' hitters, mixing it with a
changeup and a good fastball as he allowed just two hits over the
first six innings. He was relieved by Jim Mecir in the seventh,
after Justice singled home the Yankees' second run, and the Yankees
loaded the bases with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius struck out, Luis Sojo was due to bat and a hulking
and familiar figure emerged from the Yankees' dugout to pinch-hit:
Jose Canseco. The crowd roared, the reflections of flashbulbs
flickered on the broad back of his jersey, and Canseco deliberately
donned his protective equipment before taking two massive practice
swings.
</P>
<P>
   On a 2-1 pitch, Mecir jammed Canseco with a fastball, Canseco
swung, the head of his bat flew about 120 feet in foul territory on
the third base side, while the ball flared harmlessly to right, an
inning ending pop-out.
</P>
<P>
   But Oakland flubbed a couple of scoring chances in the eighth
and ninth, and the Yankees were still down a run in the bottom of
the ninth, when Isringhausen appeared. He has 25 saves, on the
power of his fastball and the sharpness of his breaking ball. He
throws gas, Justice said later, with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Williams walked to the plate, looking for that fastball.
Isringhausen threw it, and later, Williams used both hands to
describe the placement of the pitch: right over the middle of the
plate, square in the middle of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a bull's-eye,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He made imperfect contact, the ball soaring high to right field
_ but there was no doubt he had hit it far enough to carry beyond
the right-field wall. Williams bounced around the bases, jogging on
his toes, like a sprinter. The Yankee players rushed to the front
of the dugout to greet him. Justice waited at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams descended into the dugout, the crowd was roaring,
and Justice prepared to step into the batter's box. He was ready to
hit, but his name had not been announced over the public address
system. He turned and asked Dana DeMuth, the home plate umpire, if
he could hit, and DeMuth waved him to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, Williams was accepting congratulations from
teammates. Clemens had jumped off a trainers' table, raising his
right arm out of the bucket of ice. Don Zimmer, the Yankees' bench
coach, turned to Manager Joe Torre and said, ``Just two pitches,
that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking hopefully, of course; it was an idle wish. Two
home runs on two pitches. No one could remember seeing that before.
</P>
<P>
   Justice was looking for a fastball to drive. Isringhausen threw
a fastball, Justice's right foot flicked forward and he whipped the
bat through the strike zone. Williams's head was down in the
dugout, for he was putting his helmet away, and he turned in time
to see the ball zooming over the infield.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question, Justice said later, that the ball was
going to go over the head of the center fielder. The only question
was whether it would get high enough, for Justice had hit the ball
so hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might've been the hardest he's hit a ball since he's been
here,'' Torre said of the outfielder obtained from Cleveland in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Long, the Oakland center fielder, took a couple of
steps toward the wall, stopped and watched Justice's 30th home run
land among the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Justice rounded second. The two girls jumped out of the stands
and ran into left field. Clemens yelled and screamed. The loge
section of Yankee Stadium quivered, literally. Justice crossed home
plate and was pounded on top of the helmet by teammates, until he
spun away, laughing. &QL;

MARINERS SLAM, SWEEP WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ There was a time that a performance like the one
turned in by Joel Pineiro would be worthy of immediate
canonization, keys to the city of Seattle and a lifetime pass to
EMP.
</P>
<P>
   All Pineiro did yesterday was take the biggest step in baseball,
from the minor leagues to the majors. He did it with style. And he
did it against the team with the best record in the American
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my, this is the best feeling in the world,'' Pineiro said
after his contribution to a doubleheader sweep of the White Sox,
the team with the best record in the American League. ``I'm still
in la-la-land.''
</P>
<P>
   And what will be Pineiro's reward for having pitched six innings
to beat the White Sox in the first game of a doubleheader Tuesday
night in Comiskey Park? He got the word after the game that he's
leaving la-la-land and heading back to Class AAA Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   He'll leave with the memory of his first major league victory.
And he'll leave with an image of one of the best defensive plays of
the year, the capper to the Mariners' 7-5 win in Game 2 after
Pineiro had pitched the Mariners to a 12-4 victory in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki walked a batter and hit a batter to open the
ninth with the Mariners holding a two-run lead. Center fielder Mike
Cameron saved him a run with a terrific shoetop-level catch, but
the Mariners defense was just getting warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Baines, as a good a ninth-inning hitter as there is,
simply crushed a Sasaki pitch. He hit the ball as hard as a ball
can be hit and not have the seams unravel. First baseman John
Olerud reacted with stunning quickness, diving to his left to spear
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the ball was by Ole,'' second baseman Mark McLemore
said. ``Baines has been around for 700 years because he always hits
like that in that situation. But when I looked into the corner, I
didn't see the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just praying he caught the ball,'' Sasaki said. ``What
he did was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Mariners have been doing is awesome. By sweeping,
Seattle moved to 21 games over .500 (67-46) for the first time in
franchise history. Of a more immediate concern, the Mariners moved
five games in front of Oakland in the American League West race.
Seattle has won five games in succession in New York (three) and
Chicago (two), the homes of the current AL East and AL Central
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And they have their top two starters, Jamie Moyer and Aaron
Sele, going in the final two games in Chicago today and tomorrow.
The best the Mariners would hope for in talking about this
eight-game trip through hostile territory was winning five times.
Now they have a chance for more. They want more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be greedy,'' shortstop Alex Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle won the opener behind Pineiro and a couple of grand
slams, one each by Jay Buhner, who opened the Mariners' scoring in
the first inning, and by Edgar Martinez, who brought the last four
runs home in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit a solo homer in the opener, and he hit another
rocket, this one leaving an impact crater when it landed 458 feet
from home plate in the fourth inning. Because it came with the
White Sox holding a 4-0 lead in the fourth, it didn't seem like a
big deal. And after Chicago scored to go up 5-1 in the bottom of
the inning, it seemed less big still.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fifth, the Mariners massed three consecutive hits by
Dan Wilson, McLemore and Rickey Henderson after an inning-opening
walk to Carlos Guillen. That produced one run, and Cameron came off
the bench with a pinch-hit double against his old team, getting the
M's to within 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The inning should have ended there, but Sox shortstop Jose
Valentin, after getting the first out on a potential inning-ending
double play grounder, threw the ball away at first base. Two runs
scored on the play, giving the Mariners the lead and setting up
starter Freddy Garcia, who hadn't pitched well, for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The error was Valentin's 29th of the year, a staggering total
for the shortstop on a team in first place. The entire Mariners
starting infield in Game 2, for example, has committed 20 errors.
Total. The Chicago defense, the worst in the majors, cost the White
Sox a chance to salvage a split.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mariners' defense, as personified by Cameron and Olerud,
preserved the sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more proof that we're one of the best defensive teams
in the league,'' Cameron said. ``Olerud's play was bigger than
mine. He saved two runs, for sure. But we've gotten here by making
those kinds of plays.''
</P>
<P>
   They've also gotten here by pitching. Garcia was wild, but hung
around long enough to get the win in the nightcap. Pineiro was
simply better than the White Sox, at least for this night.
</P>
<P>
   What Pineiro asserted by beating the White Sox was that the
Mariners have quality arms at Tacoma, ready for promotion to the
big leagues. And what the Mariners will assert by sending Pineiro
back down is that there's no room at the inn.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle. Too much pitching. Imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Pineiro had a relatively easy time of it. He
didn't even have a bad case of nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had butterflies more when I was stretching and warming up,''
the slightly built (6 feet 1, 180 pounds) right-hander said. ``In
the game, everything was fine. I think pitching for a first-place
team relaxes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pineiro relaxed the White Sox's bats to the point of putting
them to sleep, hitting the corners and keeping his breaking ball
down. He didn't give up a run until the fifth, when Charles Johnson
homered.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Mariners were holding a 6-0 lead, and the
White Sox, owners of the most productive offense in the AL _ they
lead in average at .290 and in runs scored _ weren't able to solve
the Pineiro puzzle. He threw all four of his pitches, mostly for
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I expected he'd do,'' Buhner said of Pineiro.
``He was excellent. I've seen the way he carried himself in spring
training. He was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there were those four runs that Buhner provided
with his 10th career grand slam. It was Buhner's only hit of the
game, but it was the game's defining moment. Chicago starter Jon
Garland opened the game giving up a single, but then got a double
play. After that, though, his pitches were up and he walked the
next three men he faced, bringing up Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   The count went full, mostly because Garland was having trouble
keeping the ball down in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation, I'm sitting on a fastball,'' Buhner said.
``I'm looking for one thing and one thing only.''
</P>
<P>
   He got it. Then he got all of hit, launching a 420-foot drive
into the left-field bleachers that triggered a Seattle offensive
spree that would see the M's pound out 17 hits, including three
homers, in the opener. Game 2 saw nine more hits and two more
homers.
</P>
<P>
   And another win. With a chance for more today and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get greedy,'' Rodriguez said, stressing the point.
</P>
<P>
   Greed is good.

DREIFORT HITS TWO HOMERS IN DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since the All-Star break Darren Dreifort's done it
with his right arm, winning his first four starts and
re-establishing himself as a force in the Los Angeles Dodgers'
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   He did pretty well in his fifth start, too, but no one really is
going to remember his 6 effective innings Tuesday against the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the lasting memory will be the pair of homers Dreifort
hit, measuring a combined 903 feet, as the Dodgers hit a
season-high five home runs and beat the Cubs 7-5 at Dodger Stadium
to end a losing streak at three games.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield broke his tie with the Cubs' Sammy Sosa for the
major-league lead in homers with his 36th of the season in the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love hitting, but that's not my job,'' said Dreifort, who
took a curtain call after the second home run. ``We would have won
without it. I take a lot of pride in my batting, but my job is what
I did on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort became the first pitcher to hit two homers in a game
since Atlanta's Derek Lilliquist did it May 1, 1990, against the
Mets. Dreifort also became the first Dodgers pitcher to hit two
homers in a game since Don Drysdale did it Aug. 23, 1958, against
the Milwaukee Braves at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   His first was a 441-foot shot into the edge of the right-field
bleachers in center field in the fourth inning. Dreifort's other
homer went 462 feet into the left-center-field bleachers in the
fifth inning. Dreifort struck out in the sixth inning in his quest
for his third homer of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty impressive,'' Cubs first baseman Mark Grace said. ``He
hit 900-feet worth of homers. Heck, he could hit fourth in our
lineup. It's better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's three homers this season are the most by a pitcher
since Fernando Valenzuela hit three in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Dreifort has never been a slouch with the bat. During
his All-American career at Wichita State, he batted .318 with 25
homers and 89 RBI in 314 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort also pitched a doozy of a game for his fifth straight
win since the All-Star break. He is 9-7 overall. In allowing two
earned runs on six hits, Dreifort kept his post-All-Star break ERA
at 2.67.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dreifort) can do that kind of stuff,'' Dodgers second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek said. ``I don't know why we don't use him in
pinch-hitting situations. He is a valuable asset. You can't ignore
his bat. Get him ready, let him take some BP, and I say we go for
it. If you get him some more at-bats, get him ready, look out,
Sheff.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed three runs (one earned) in the third inning,
but it shouldn't have been any.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out, Sammy Sosa
grounded to shortstop Kevin Elster for what should have been a
perfect double play. But Elster's flip to Mark Grudzielanek was
wide of second and rolled to the wall adjacent the Cubs' dugout,
allowing pitcher Phil Norton and Ricky Gutierrez to score. Mark
Grace added an RBI single to put the Cubs ahead 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Elster, starting because the lefty Norton (0-1) was pitching,
got one of the runs back with a solo homer in the fourth inning. It
turned out to be the first of four the Dodgers hit in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later Dreifort followed with his first of the night
to tie it 3-3. Devon White grounded out and Grudzielanek flied out,
but Sheffield retook the major-league lead and gave the Dodgers a
4-3 lead with his solo homer. Eric Karros singled to left and Shawn
Green hit Norton's 1-0 pitch over the right-field fence for a 6-3
Dodgers lead.
</P>
<P>
   The four homers in the inning allowed by Norton, making his
second major-league start, tied a major-league record. It was the
18th time the dubious feat was accomplished, the last being St.
Louis' Andy Benes last month against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' five homers were also the most they've hit in a
game since belting six at Colorado on Sept. 26, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit five, that's outstanding,'' Dreifort said. ``We didn't
need to hit that many to win the ballgame, but we did.''

ORTIZ EDGES IDOL MARTINEZ
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia and
pitching coach Bud Black couldn't emphasize it enough during spring
training _ please, please don't compare 24-year-old Ramon Ortiz to
Boston Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia and Black might find that a little more difficult to
do, now that the Angels pitcher has beaten his mentor, throwing a
complete-game two-hitter to defeat the Red Sox 2-1 Tuesday night
before 27,293 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz had thrown 100 pitches entering the ninth and had to face
the Red Sox's Nos. 2, 3 and 4 hitters. He got Jason Varitek on a
popup to the catcher, Nomar Garciaparra grounded out to first and
Carl Everett popped to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, I don't believe it,'' Ortiz said after the game.
``He's my idol. Today was the greatest day of my life. I still
can't believe I won the game. . . . I just felt very proud to be
facing him. I was pitching against the best pitcher in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that prevented Ortiz (4-2) from throwing a
shutout was a bad call from second-base umpire Mike Fichter. Troy
O'Leary led off the fifth inning with a liner off the wall in right
field. But right fielder Orlando Palmeiro played the carom off the
wall perfectly and fired to shortstop Benji Gil.
</P>
<P>
   The throw was a few feet up the line, but it seemed to catch
O'Leary off guard. He went in standing up but not before Gil tagged
him on the rear as he went by. Fichter, however, called O'Leary
safe.
</P>
<P>
   A groundout to second by Brian Daubach got O'Leary to third, and
Ed Sprague's grounder to second scored O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the Red Sox scored their run, Ortiz maintained
the composure the Angels have been looking for. He needed that
composure again in the seventh when center fielder Garret Anderson
dropped a routine fly ball from O'Leary with one out, allowing
O'Leary to take second. After a visit from catcher Bengie Molina,
Ortiz retired the next two hitters to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him, 'He made an error, try to pick him up,' ''
Molina said. ``Don't let the run score. Not only for the team, but
for Garret. He feels bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz has spent most of this season in the minors because he has
lacked that composure, particularly during tough situations. And
there could not have been a more-difficult task than pitching
against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Molina has taken on the chore of trying to keep Ortiz's emotions
under control, but he said Tuesday he didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to do anything tonight,'' Molina said. ``He did
it on his own. He was very calm. When he struck out Sprague (in the
sixth) was the only time he got excited, the only time in the game
I told him to calm down. . . . I was very surprised because I know
the kind of game it was for him. I think he was trying to copy
Pedro, the way Pedro works.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked, even if it disappointed a season-high
walk-up crowd of 6,798 that came to see Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might have come to see Pedro tonight,'' Scioscia said.
``But they're coming back to see Ramon.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (13-4) pitched a typical game. He allowed only three
baserunners _ a solo homer by Tim Salmon in the second and singles
by Palmeiro and Anderson in the fourth. Anderson's two-out single
on a 1-2 pitch drove in Palmeiro from second with the decisive run.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out nine and walked none; Ortiz struck out six
and walked two. The two pitchers have been compared because they
are both from the Dominican Republic and have similar throwing
styles.
</P>
<P>
   As Ortiz took the mound to start the ninth, he said a prayer,
then looked into the Angels bullpen and saw nobody warming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went out for the ninth inning, I said, 'Help me God,
help me really bear down and pitch,' '' Ortiz said. ``I was very
emotional when Troy Glaus caught the ball for the last out of the
game. I went crazy. I started to jump like a little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz said he shared a hug with Martinez before the game, then
watched him pitch from the dugout during the game.
</P>

   ``PURPLE CANE ROAD''
</P>
<P>
   by James Lee Burke
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Burke has been called the Faulkner of crime fiction, and while
we might quibble with the particulars, there's no denying that he's
very, very good. His characters inhabit his setting - the darker
corners of Louisiana - with consummate ease, and he makes few of
the missteps common to other writers, mistakes that disrupt a
reader's easy way through a violent and sometimes tawdry story. In
Burke's new novel, detective Dave Robicheaux learns from a New
Orleans pimp some sketchy details about the death of Robicheaux's
mother, an alleged prostitute whom he has not seen since he was in
high school. Robicheaux's obsessive search for more information
takes him through a maze of colorful characters, any one of whom
could carry a novel alone. The book's only flaw is its ending,
which has so many twists that it seems calculated. Otherwise,
there's no beating the rich, sweaty atmosphere of the bayou country
Burke portrays so well.

   Murray, Washington Bureau chief for the(beginitalic) Wall Street

quiz that's supposed to tell if you are prepared to succeed in the
New Economy. New &AMP; Notable took this quiz, and we are dazed to
report that we scored very high - a fact that probably says more
about Murray's questions than our financial savvy. Indeed, much of
his book is just a compendium of common sense, filtered through the
sensibilities of the Internet age. His advice: Use your computer to
get information on car prices, airfares, stocks, insurance rates,
long-distance phone service. Dicker over everything you buy -
sellers often lower their prices. And don't buy the fancy model
when the standard model will do. There's not a whole lot of new
information here, but it's an effective, entry-level pep talk for
people who are intimidated by money and by the decisions that will
determine their financial futures.

   ``When I fight,'' Hetty Green once said, ``there is usually a
funeral, and it isn't mine.'' She was a driven, demented, stingy
and unpleasant woman at a time when Victorian ladies were expected
to be gracious and demure. But when she died in 1916, she was worth
$100 million - more than $1 billion in today's dollars. Crossen
profiles some of the wealthiest people of all time, from
11th-century plunderer Machmud of Ghazni (who accumulated wealth by
saying ``That's mine,'' and killing anyone who disagreed) to the
sleazy and corrupt Pope Alexander VI, who made his fortune during
the 15th century through shameless use of divine imperative, and to
Bill Gates, whose monopolistic methods look like church work by
comparison. Sadly, of the 10 people here, only one is a woman, but
we like Hetty best. ``I go my own way, take no partners, risk no
one else's fortune,'' she once said, ``therefore I am Madame
Ishmael, set against every man.''

   It's hard to defend (beginitalic)Coyote Ugly (enditalic)as being
much of a movie. It's more like a collection of music videos, or a
pretty good LeAnn Rimes CD, or a fashion show for belly shirts,
leather pants and cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that's all it's trying to be.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which could be retitled (beginitalic)Urban
Cowgirl(enditalic), delivers exactly what it promises - gorgeous
women in skimpy clothing, dancing in a rowdy bar. And it does so
with such an amiable tone, you can't help but like the silly thing.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Coyote Ugly (enditalic)is all about titillation,
since its PG-13 rating won't allow anything more. The movie is
essentially one long parade of belly buttons.
</P>
<P>
   While men will enjoy it for obvious reasons, there's also plenty
here to attract women, including two strong female characters in
leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   Piper Perabo gives a winning performance as Violet, an aspiring
songwriter from the sticks who goes to work in a crazed New York
bar to make ends meet. The winsome Perabo seems to have emerged
unscathed from (beginitalic)The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle(enditalic), which is no mean feat.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Bello ((beginitalic)ER(enditalic)), does a nice job as
Lil, the tough bar owner who hires Violet to add some innocence to
the mix. Given a caricature to play, Bello pumps life into the
role.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this chaos, there is John Goodman, doing a
heart-warming turn as Violet's widowed father, who doesn't want her
to leave for the big city. When the film threatens to slow down,
Goodman buoys it with one funny line after another. He also injects
a much-needed shot of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the bar. Though supposedly patterned after a real
tavern, (beginitalic)Coyote Ugly (enditalic)seems like no other.
First off, the bartenders, or ``coyotes,'' all look like models
(one is played by real-life supermodel Tyra Banks). Between serving
drinks and setting the bar on fire, they turn up the music and
dance in their cowboy boots and halter tops, whipping the patrons
into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the movie's trademark scene, and to make sure you don't
miss it, they show it about six times. After awhile, this becomes a
bit repetitious, as if the filmmakers couldn't think of much else
to do.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who ever tended bar, the movie must seem pretty
ridiculous. But this is more about fantasy than reality.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the gaps between the dancing, producer Jerry Bruckheimer
added a paper-thin love story, featuring hunky Adam Garcia as
Kevin, Violet's would-be boyfriend. We know Kevin is a nice guy,
because he collects comic books. There's a cute little back-story
that has Kevin trying to persuade Violet to overcome her stage
fright and perform her songs on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Perabo gets a little more help than that. In the
movie, her singing is dubbed by country-Western star Rimes, which
is a little like subbing Michael Jordan into a pickup game at the
Y.
</P>
<P>
   Still, (beginitalic)Coyote Ugly (enditalic)has a pretty good
beat, and you can dance to it.

 &HT;    DEFINING YEAR AS BUSH AND BOOMERS GROW UP(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By ROBERT ROBB(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - There was an interesting subtext in George W. Bush's
acceptance speech, a quest to define the baby-boomer generation and
the lessons it should have learned from the cultural war of the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't claim that the cultural war continues, as Pat
Buchanan mistakenly did at the 1992 convention. After all, there
aren't many baby-boomer adults going around proclaiming that the
country is rotten to the core, and that drugs and licentious sex
are good.
</P>
<P>
   There remain important cultural battlefields today. But the
cultural war of the 1960s, in which many boomers comprehensively
rejected the values of their parents, is over.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are '60s cultural warriors who still regard
their experiences as noble and inspiriting. Not that they are
anxious for their sons or daughters to replicate them, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons appear to fall in this category. When Bill was
caught dissembling about his draft circumstances during the 1992
campaign, Hillary vehemently objected to a proposed statement
because she felt it equivocated about the moral high ground of
those who objected to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Bush framed his acceptance speech in terms of a generational
handoff. He began with a tribute to the World War II generation,
and then said, ``The question comes to the sons and daughters of
(their) achievement. {hellip} What is asked of us?''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Bill Clinton as emblematic of the boomer generation, as
indeed he is. Smart without being wise. Professing virtues he does
not practice. Engaging in destructive personal behavior while
holding himself out as morally superior to those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   In a phrase full of self-revelation, Bush said the boomer
generation needs to ``show we have grown up before we grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave boomers credit for ``test(ing) limit'' that led to
improved conditions for women and minorities. However, he said,
``At times, we lost our way. But we're coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   He described reforming Social Security and Medicare as a
generational responsibility ``before the challenges of our time
become crises for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's generational pitch isn't programmatic; it's moral,
and ethical, and religious. As he put it, ``We know we must renew
our values to restore our country.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Bush is appealing to boomers to redefine who they are
by replacing Bill Clinton, the first boomer president, with
himself, the son of the last president of the World War II
generation, and a boomer who has learned the right lesson of the
cultural war: that for much of what is truly important in life, our
parents were right and we were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Whether boomers feel they need to redeem themselves from the
example of Bill Clinton as the first boomer president is uncertain
political territory. And it is uncertain how this appeal applies to
Al Gore, as opposed to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apparently was a fringe observer during the cultural war.
He wasn't a protester, and he didn't dissemble to avoid serving.
But he did act to make the likelihood of facing combat fairly
remote. He was admittedly undirected for much of his adult life,
ultimately given focus by faith and fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore volunteered for military service, although reportedly more
out of a sense of duty to his father than to his country. He
reports returning from the Vietnam War, and his father's electoral
defeat, disillusioned. But he recovered quickly enough to run for
Congress as soon as the Constitution's age requirement permitted
it. And he's been a politician ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The boomers are unquestionably the most self-indulgent
generation in American history. Paradoxically, Bush is catering to
this self-indulgence by casting the election, in part, as an
opportunity for boomers to redefine themselves as having finally
grown up.

 &HT;    SELF-DESCRIBED WITCH ACCUSED OF PERFORMING SEX RITUALS WITH
GIRLS(a)

 &HT;    By CHRISTINA LEONARD(a)

<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Police say a self-described witch lured young girls
into his home to practice witchcraft but ended up playing
inappropriate games of ``Truth or Dare'' with them.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Vernon Benton now sits behind bars, accused of 17 felony
sex-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   On occasional Sunday afternoons since January, police say, the
25-year-old Phoenix resident gathered nearly a dozen girls at a
west Phoenix park to hold rituals. Wearing a puffy white shirt,
pants and boots, Benton led the girls in praying, chanting and
humming, Detective Bob Ragsdale said.
</P>
<P>
   After the rituals were over, Benton brought some of the girls
back to his apartment near 43rd Avenue and Thomas Road, where they
played ``Truth or Dare'' that involved sexual contact, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Benton's wife, Spring Benton, vehemently denied the accusations
today, saying that the arrests stem from false accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all a lie. It's retaliation,'' she said. ``My husband
is innocent. He did not deserve this. I am behind my husband 100
percent, and I have a lot of proof that he did not do this because
I was always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring Benton, who has two children and is pregnant with a
third, said she and her husband practice Wicca, a nature-based
religion. Among other things, those who follow Wicca practice god
and goddess worship and the use of magic defined by the belief,
``An ye harm none, do what ye will,'' according to the
(beginitalic)Dictionary of Religion(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   She said they occasionally have held gatherings, but those
included only adults.
</P>
<P>
   Benton, a security guard, originally was arrested July 19.
However, police submitted additional allegations to the Maricopa
County Attorney's Office on Friday. He was being held on $106,200
bond on suspicion of multiple counts of sexual conduct with a
minor, child molestation, sexual abuse, indecent exposure and
public sexual indecency.
</P>
<P>
   So far, police have identified four victims - ages 10 to 15 -
but said there may be more victims. Anybody with information is
urged to call Child Help at (602) 534-3200. &QL;

 &HT;    INS TARGETS SMUGGLERS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By TESSIE BORDEN(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a)

<P>
   (PHOENIX) - U.S. Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner this
morning will announce a new enforcement push to destroy the
networks immigrant smugglers use to move human cargo {ndash}
airports and safehouses.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, dubbed Operation Denial, will pull U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service agents from other duties in Phoenix and
other offices in Tucson, Las Vegas and Reno, Nev. It will assign
them around the clock at Sky Harbor International Airport, Las
Vegas' McCarran Airport, and the main land routes in between.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to choke a distribution system in which smugglers use
Phoenix addresses as safehouses and commercial flights as
large-scale ``mules'' to move illegal immigrants from city to city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix has emerged as a real focus point of the violence and
victimization associated with smuggling,'' Meissner said in an
interview with The Arizona Republic Tuesday. ``We have become more
and more aware of the depth and sophistication of smuggling in
Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissner will detail the operation at a press conference
scheduled for this morning in Phoenix. More than 100 agents will be
assigned first to the airports and then to help local police, who
normally get tips on suspected safehouses. On Tuesday afternoon,
INS officials briefed Phoenix Police Chief Harold Hurtt on the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The extra officers will first work three shifts at Sky Harbor,
targeting smugglers who buy rows of one-way tickets to cities like
Chicago, Los Angeles and Dallas for illegal immigrants, then herd
them onto flights just before takeoff. Agents hope to shut down
such smuggling in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after the organized smuggling enterprises, the
money, the document fraud, the network,'' Meissner said. ``We want
to do a major disruption of these enterprises. We're prepared to be
at this for several months.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when local safehouses start filling up with immigrants
waiting to leave town, the agents will target them in force.
</P>
<P>
   Ahr said about 10 INS agents will be in Flagstaff to guard the
main road smugglers use to get to McCarran when Sky Harbor gets too
``hot.'' They will try to catch the smugglers before they leave the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is unique for the extent to which the INS informed
organizations that work with immigrants, meeting with them during
planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like in the last year, the INS has really tried to
become more forthright and more anxious to involve organizations
such as ours,'' said Kathleen Judd, director of the for-profit
Immigration Outreach Center, which deals with citizenship problems.
``(They) let us know what's happening within their offices and what
they are trying to do to better their services.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport assignment won't be anything new for some agents.
Five Phoenix-based anti-smuggling agents have been working Sky
Harbor since January. To date, they have made more than 1,500
arrests and confiscated more than 19 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Woodrum, chief of investigations at the Phoenix office,
recently called the airport ``a Grand Central Station for immigrant
smuggling.'' Investigators even keep a catalogue, complete with
pictures, of suspected smugglers they arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Few are freelancers, said Jack Weaver, in charge of the Phoenix
anti-smuggling unit. Instead, they are small cogs in large
operations that reach into Mexico to ``brincadores,'' or jumpers,
who sneak immigrants through the U.S.-Mexico border fence.
</P>
<P>
   Once across, Weaver said, the immigrants get turned over to a
driver that takes them to Phoenix. There, yet another custodian
keeps them at a safehouse. After a few days, that person hires
somebody else to drive the people to the airport, get the tickets,
and put them aboard the planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is organized traffic,'' Meissner said. ``People do not
cross these areas by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At any point, each smuggler may demand more money or abandon his
cargo, as has happened in recent months in remote desert areas
where immigrants have died of heat exposure.
</P>
<P>
   And problems multiply when rival smugglers try to steal each
other's loads, Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're called rip-off crews,'' Weaver said. ``They go to
someone's drop-house and steal their aliens ... It creates a lot of
potential for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The money paid has risen with the level of organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1985, the average cost of a drive from the border to
Phoenix was $200 to $400,'' said James Jankowski, who supervises
the airport detail. ``Now, it can be as much as $1,200, and as much
as $5,000 if it involves an OTM (Other than Mexican).''
</P>
<P>
   Ahr said agents will closely monitor Operation Denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, once this thing is over, can we expect any
difference?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahr's answer is yes, in part because agents will gain much more
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have more documentation, more photos, more people
identified,'' he said. ``That will serve as a deterrent effect.''

 &HT;    Time's Austin cartoon isn't familiar
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Let me blow on my knuckles in excitement,
because Austin has made the big time again.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine's Aug. 7 Republican Convention issue contains a
full-page cartoon map on Page 100 called ``A Map of the Governor's
Austin,'' done by artist Eric Chase Anderson, a Houston native who
attended the University of Texas and is living in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the governor's jurisdiction doesn't extend into
South Austin, because the map begins at the Capitol and ends at
Town Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The map shows some of the governor's alleged haunts, among them
the Cigar Palace at Eighth and Colorado streets, where, according
to the map, ``the governor buys his cigars.''
</P>
<P>
   I realize the Republicans are trying to act like the Democrats
in an effort to be inclusive. But in light of the cigar goings-on
at the White House, I would think the governor would distance
himself from the stogie thing.
</P>
<P>
   The map also features Las Manitas, the artsy Mexican food place
at 211 Congress Ave. I have a hard time imaging George W. hanging
out at Las Manitas, since it's the kind of place where the fire
sprinklers are rigged to detect and spray Republicans when they
walk through the door. However, Cynthia Perez, one of the owners,
says Bush has been in a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time he came in. We didn't know who was
more scared _ him or us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cute map, what with an illustration of the governor
dressed in a suit, cowboy hat and running shoes, but it ignores
many hectic details of life in our fair city. The map has the
``jogging governor'' running peacefully along the Town
Lakehike-and-bike trail, but Anderson left out the large truck that
nearly ran over him. There isn't a single traffic cone on the map.
And where are the building cranes, and the techies wandering
aimlessly into the intersection with cell phones jammed in their
ears?
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, the artist misplaced the Four Seasons Hotel. How
do you lose a 291-room hotel? The Four Seasons is at the end of San
Jacinto Boulevard, on Town Lake. The artist puts the Four Seasons
inland on a corner of Second and Trinity streets.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think the artist could have found the Four Seasons. At
$250 to $375 a night, just follow the smell of money and hang a
right.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a big whoops. The map calls Cesar Chavez Street by its
former name of First Street. It also has a drawing of the Iron
Works Barbecue, at Red River and Cesar Chavez, and says it is ``the
governor's favorite BBQ.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the governor come in a lot? ``Uhhhhh, no,'' said Charlotte
Finch, the Iron Works' owner. Maybe he has his food picked up.
</P>
<P>
   The map mentions Hut's, the hamburger joint on West Sixth
Street, and says the governor says he swings by when he wants ``a
quick bite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen the governor in a long time,'' said Michael
Hutchinson, the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the map show a Jeep Cherokee circling a downtown block
for 20 minutes, looking for a place to park. So though it may be
``A Map of the Governor's Austin,'' it's not the same Austin I live
in.

 &HT;    Women ministers undaunted
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They call themselves ``sisters in the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastors Dorothy E. Johnson, Ramona Hunter and Emma Curtis-White
lead congregations within blocks of each other in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   When they get together, they chat and laugh like girlfriends.
But the subtext is spiritual, not personal.
</P>
<P>
   They don't compete for members _ ``There's enough sheep out
there to bring in,'' Hunter notes _ but turn to each other for
support in a world that often spurns women in the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Only Johnson was ordained in the Southern Baptist Church, but
all three are troubled by the Southern Baptist Convention's
declaration this summer that women should no longer serve as
pastors. They all know what it's like to be told, ``I can't come to
your church because you are a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Are they discouraged? Demoralized?
</P>
<P>
   Not a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't oust me; I'm standing on Jesus and his word,'' said
Johnson, senior pastor and co-founder of New Philadelphia Community
Baptist Church. ``It's better to obey God than man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's own congregation, Progressive Missionary Baptist
Church, supported her when she took over for her husband, longtime
pastor Sherman Hunter. Yet Hunter resisted the call to the
ministry: ``For a year I didn't tell anybody that I felt a
calling.''
</P>
<P>
   When she finally decided to heed the call, ``It was like someone
lifted a building off my back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That calling of mine was SOMETHING,'' echoed Curtis-White.
</P>
<P>
   It was strong enough to compel her to leave her home church, a
Baptist congregation, in Cincinnati. When she sang gospel in the
church choir, the pastor greeted her with a warm smile whenever she
entered the church. After she announced her intention to enter the
ministry, he would avert his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   That hurt _ but it didn't stop her. A year ago, Curtis-White
founded the Church on the Rock Ministries, a ``street ministry''
that feeds the needy every Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   These pastors worry less about their own future as ministers
than about the spiritual well-being of men like those who voted to
oust women from the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was non-binding, a sort of spiritual don't-ask, don't-
tell policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me is that they're not seeing in the spirit,''
Curtis-White said. ``We're supposed to see in the spirit and not
gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Hunter, ``When Jesus Christ commissioned his church, he
said, 'Go ye, and bring his word.' He did not say, 'Go men.'''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis-White chuckled at the memory of a man who argued that the
text was 'go he.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, he's got a problem!'' Hunter roared.
</P>
<P>
   The women also meet in the more formal setting of the Women
International Interracial Interdenominational Christian Ministers
Alliance. Founded by Johnson, it brings ministers and laywomen
together to volunteer in the community. The group's second annual
conference begins Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Many men have been supportive of these pastors' calling.
</P>
<P>
   And the others? Johnson has a message for men who don't mind
putting women in charge of fundraising and Sunday school, but
somehow deem them unfit for the pulpit:
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you fight me, the more I'm determined.''

 &HT;    Al buys a conscience, and a conservative, too
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following the Republican convention in Philadelphia, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush led Vice President Al Gore by 17 percentage points
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bunch. Trying to put the best face on these dismal poll
results, Democrats responded that Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis led Vice President George Bush by a similar amount at one
point only to eventually lose the election.
</P>
<P>
   A more dramatic turnaround occurred nearly four years later when
President Bush enjoyed an astonishing 92 percent popularity
preference only to later lose to Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Democrats argued, all candidates get a poll bounce
coming out of their conventions. Gore also will rebound coming out
of the Democratic convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   They're probably right. But a Monday night USA Today/CNN/Gallup
poll after Gore announced his selection of Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman as his running mate showed Bush's lead had been cut to
only 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the usual plus and minus error points, the results
clearly show that Bush and his running mate Dick Cheney dropped
dramatically after Gore selected Lieberman _ a man best known for
taking the microphone on the Senate floor and condemning Clinton
for immoral, harmful and deceitful behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The big bump in Gore's poll numbers appears to be based on his
selection of a man who said Clinton had ``compromised his moral
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, that's why Gore selected Lieberman. Gore wanted to
separate himself from a man he has praised with puppy-like devotion
for the past eight years, especially at a bizarre hug fest on the
White House lawn after Clinton had been impeached. That's when Gore
predicted that Clinton would ``go down in history as one of our
greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, on the other hand, said Clinton had ``lowered himself
and his office'' by engaging in behavior that sends a harmful
message to American families, ``particularly to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as the moral conscience in the Senate, Lieberman has
teamed up with Bill Bennett, a Republican moralist, to condemn the
coarsening of American values by Hollywood, in music and on
television.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush picked Dick Cheney to buy some foreign policy experience
and gravitas, Gore apparently picked Lieberman to buy some morality
and integrity. The poll numbers show that it has worked.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's selection of Lieberman, roundly hailed by most Americans,
did not go over with liberal Democrats who felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Gore's selection of Lieberman, Robert Scheer, a
contributing editor the Los Angeles Times, wrote, ``What a gutless
wonder Al Gore is turning out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheer condemned Gore for picking a running mate ``whose
anti-Clinton sound bites, including attacks on the Clinton health
plan, not to mention condemning Clinton before the impeachment
proceedings in the Senate, could make up the entire ad campaign for
George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush campaig Lieberman supports a strong military, free
trade, school vouchers, a moment of silence in public schools,
cleaning up trash in television programming and some privatization
of Social Security. He also has questioned affirmative action and,
according to Scheer, voted for a 1994 Jesse Helms bill that barred
federal funds to schools that used materials ``supportive of
homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore knows that you can't please everyone. His selection of
Lieberman, however, shows that Gore intends to please as many
people as he can.

 &HT;    EDS: THIS IS FILE 1 OF 2
 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com. Please include your name and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that people who are in their homes during storms
when lightning occurs should stay away from windows, because
lightning can strike through the glass. If that's the case, why are
we considered safe in cars when lightning strikes?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not the glass that protects you in a car, it's the car's
metal frame, said Greg Forbes of The Weather Channel. Metal is an
excellent conductor, and the lightning current normally will flow
through the car frame to the axles, then to the wheel rims, then
arc to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   People are relatively safe from lightning inside their homes as
long as they aren't in contact with some of the most likely routes
that lightning might take through the house, such as pipes and
wires, Forbes added.
</P>
<P>
   While lightning can go through window glass, it's more likely to
find some other path, because glass isn't a good conductor. It's
more likely to hit the roof, than go horizontally through the
window. Being away from the exterior walls _ windows included _
isn't a bad idea, though, because it puts you farther from the
lightning strike outside.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes added these additional safety tips: Don't talk on the
telephone (an electrical current from the lightning may travel down
the wire); don't take a bath or shower (because an electrical
current may travel along the pipes); and don't touch appliances (a
current may go through your home's electrical wiring into them).
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the hurricane season just starting, is there an online
site where one can obtain a hurricane tracking map on which to
follow them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several sites offer good hurricane tracking information,
including these:
http://lumahai.soest.hawaii.edu/TropicalWeather/atlantictrack.gif;
http://hurricane.terrapin.com/;
www.nwrc.nbs.gov/special/track2.html; www.nws.noaa.gov/.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw where Melissa Manchester's father was a bassoonist with
the Metropolitan Opera orchestra. Is that where she got her
interest in music?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. According to biographical information on the
singer-songwriter's official Web site _ www.melissa-manchester.com/
_ her father introduced her to all the classics, and by the age of
15 she already was a published poet.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Feb. 15, 1951, in New York, she graduated from the High
School of the Performing Arts, where she studied acting. After
that, she entered New York University School of the Arts and
enrolled in a songwriting class taught by Paul Simon. She landed a
staff writing job at Chappel Music and performed as a solo
singer-pianist in clubs in Greenwich Village and on Manhattan's
Upper West Side, where she met Bette Midler _ soon becoming
Midler's backup singer. Within six months Manchester had a
recording contract, was a headliner at Carnegie Hall, and was on
her way.
</P>
<P>
   Her Web site, by the way, doesn't mention her mother or other
family members. ``The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock &AMP; Soul'' also
mentions only her father.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To what political party does Alan Greenspan belong? What
president appointed him to his current position?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to Current Biography Yearbook, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve System is a moderate Republican. He was nominated
by President Reagan on June 2, 1987, and was renominated in 1991 by
President Bush and again in 1996 by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you settle a friendly discussion? How many continents are
there, what are they, and what is the authoritative source for this
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: World Book Encyclopedia, The New Encyclopedia Britannica, the
Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Geography and Random House
Unabridged Dictionary all say there are seven: Asia, Africa, North
America, South America, Antarctica, Europe and Australia (listed in
order of size). Technically Europe isn't a continent, but a
peninsula of Asia, in which case the combined continent is called
Eurasia _ and there would be six.
</P>
<P>
   The islands of the Pacific, or Oceania, aren't part of any
continent. Australia is sometimes considered part of Oceania, but
Oceania isn't a continent on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you do if the Census Bureau hasn't sent anything in
the mail or come to your residence to count you?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Census Bureau says people who didn't receive a
questionnaire and weren't contacted by an enumerator should contact
their local census office and ask for field operations. The
regional census center for your state should be found in the
government section (blue pages) of the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several years ago, Q&AMP;A answered a question about some
relatives of Queen Mother Elizabeth having been put in a mental
hospital in England in the 1940s, with their existence never
acknowledged. Can you refresh my memory about that? Have there been
any new developments?
</P>
<P>
   A: The London Observer revived the subject in an article in late
July, but it added little to the reports that came to light in
1987. At that time, the news leaked out that Katherine and Nerissa
Bowes-Lyon, nieces of the Queen Mother, had been confined in the
Royal Earlswood Mental Hospital in Surrey for 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's Peerage, the guidebook to aristocratic lineage, had
recorded the sisters as having died in 1940 and 1961, which turned
out to be false. Nerissa Bowes-Lyon died in 1986. There has been no
mention of the fate of her sister, Katherine, so it's assumed that
she is still living.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, daughters of John Herbert Bowes-Lyon, the Queen
Mother's late brother, and Fenella Trefusis, a daughter of the 21st
Baron Clinton, were committed secretly to the hospital in 1941 by
their mother. Three other women, cousins of the Bowes-Lyons sisters
and daughters of Harriet Fane, sister-in-law of the Queen Mother,
also were placed in the hospital in 1941. Two were still living in
1987, but nothing about them has been reported since.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogists said all five may have shared a genetic flaw passed
by the 21st Baron Clinton, and not the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The recent London Observer report added one bit of information:
that the 99-year-old Princess Alice, duchess of Gloucester, who is
Queen Elizabeth's aunt and sister-in-law of the Queen Mother,
remains ``hidden'' in Kensington Palace in west London. A
Buckingham Palace official said she was ``with us some of the time,
but not at others.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the number of delegates to the Republican and
Democratic national political conventions determined? Is it based
on population, number of voters, or what?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each party has its own formula, resulting in ever-changing
numbers of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, each state receives a base of six
delegates-at-large. American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands
each receive a base of four, while the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico are allotted 14. Each state also receives three
congressional district delegates for each representative it has in
the U.S. House, regardless of political affiliation (not applicable
to American Samoa and the others). Then there are ``bonus
delegates'' awarded based on various factors, such as to those
states whose electoral votes were cast for Bob Dole in 1996, or to
those states electing a Republican senator or governor during
specific years.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party introduced a formula in the 1960s that
still calculates the base delegate allocation per state. The
formula involves the total number of Democratic votes in the last
three presidential elections of each state, added to the state's
total electoral vote. On top of that is the ``superdelegate''
number _ now known as the PLEO, or Party Leader and/or Elected
Official _ which was added beginning with the 1984 Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen any mention of Nancy Coverdell in the media
since her husband, Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), died suddenly.
Where is she? Any news to report?
</P>
<P>
   A: She's living in the couple's home in Washington, helping to
close out her late husband's Senate office. Georgia Republican
leaders have been very protective of Nancy Coverdell and her
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the name of Philadelphia's Hahnemann University
Hospital, where former President Gerald Ford was treated after a
stroke, come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Samuel Hahnemann was a German physician and medical reformer
who died in 1843 _ five years before a college in Philadelphia
bearing his name was born.
</P>
<P>
   He was considered the ``father of homeopathy,'' a system of
medical treatment relying on the body's basic power to heal itself,
as opposed to ``heroic'' medical practices of the time such as
bleeding, purging and leeching.
</P>
<P>
   The present institution began as Homeopathic Medical College of
Pennsylvania, founded in 1848 by three young doctors, Jacob Jeanes,
Walter Williamson and Constantine Hering. The new enterprise for
healing arts prospered and grew. In 1884, the college joined forces
with the Homeopathic Hospital of Pennsylvania under the name of The
Hahnemann Medical College &AMP; Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the college's centennial year, Hahnemann's Dr. Charles
P. Bailey performed the world's first successful valvular surgery
within the human heart, the repair of a mitral valve. Bailey's
research was the subject of a Time cover story in 1957.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When Tiger Woods first came to prominence and was asked about
his race, he said that he was a mix _ and, for fun, had made up a
word to describe his racial heritage. I believe the word was
``Cablanasian.'' Can you break down the term Woods uses, and
explain its components?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's spelled Cablinasian, which the golfer cobbled together
from these words: Caucasian, black, Indian, Asian.
</P>
<P>
   According to Current Biography Yearbook's entry on Woods, his
father, Earl Woods, is one-quarter Chinese, one-quarter American
Indian, and half black. His mother, Kultilda Punsawad Woods, is
half Thai, a quarter Chinese and a quarter white.
</P>
<P>
   As golf's most prominent athlete of multiracial heritage, Tiger
Woods has been criticized on occasion for not identifying himself
as black. But he usually refuses to weigh any aspect of his lineage
more heavily than any other, and maintains that he considers the
focus on his race insulting. ``I don't want to be the best black
golfer ever,'' he often says. ``I want to be the best golfer
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the phrase ``life of Riley,'' as in the expression
``living the life of Riley,'' originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: As with many expressions, there are several theories about
the origin. Perhaps the most prevalent is that it comes from a
comic song written by Pat Rooney of the ``Dancing Rooneys'' in the
1880s and performed by him on the vaudeville circuit. The song's
hero, Riley, tells of what he would do if he struck it rich: He
promises that New York ``will swim in wine when the White House and
Capitol are mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that it traces to poet James Whitcomb
Riley (1849-1916), whose simple, sentimental poems depicting the
lives of barefoot boys loafing and living a life of ease in the
summer were immensely popular at the time the phrase came into use.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another possibility is the turn-of-the-century tune ``The
Best in the House Is None Too Good for Reilly,'' although the
change of spelling is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The books ``Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase
Origins'' and ``Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins,''
readily available at libraries, explain such things as this.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember that about 25 years ago, during a drought, the
government sent some supersonic airplanes overhead to stir up the
atmosphere with a sonic boom and create rain. It worked, as I
recall, because rain began to fall soon afterward. Am I right?
</P>
<P>
   A: A sonic boom would have had no impact on the changing weather
pattern, according to Colin Marquis, senior meteorologist at The
Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about Chandi Heffner, the adopted
daughter of Doris Duke? As I recall, they didn't split amicably.
</P>
<P>
   A: Charlene Gail ``Chandi'' Heffner, a former belly dancer and
Hare Krishna devotee, stays out of the public eye. But some things
about her relationship with the tobacco heiress are documented.
</P>
<P>
   Heffner was 35 when she was adopted by Duke in 1988. By February
1991, Heffner was persona non grata on the Duke property and Duke
was quoted as saying the adoption was ``the greatest mistake I ever
made in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke died Oct. 28, 1993, having disinherited Heffner and leaving
the bulk of her fortune to various charities and educational
foundations. Heffner sued, seeking to become the beneficiary of the
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, it was reported that Heffner had settled her claims
for $65 million, and she hasn't been in the news since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Confederate submarine Hunley, which sank in the harbor
at Charleston, S.C., in 1864, was built in Mobile, Ala., how was it
transported to Charleston, where it sank?
</P>
<P>
   A: By train. Records show that it was secured on two railroad
flatcars for the trip, said Faith Colaluca of Friends of the
Hunley, a nonprofit organization created by the state of South
Carolina to raise public and private funds for the recovery of the
submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a new first-time homeowner and am having a lot of
difficulty removing tree stumps. My father claims to have seen a
newspaper article with a recipe for dissolving them. What can you
tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: Walter Reeves, a University of Georgia horticulture educator,
says commercial products promise to decompose roots rapidly by
chemical action. As an alternative, he suggests letting insects and
fungi consume the tissue of the stump naturally, converting it to
soil humus.
</P>
<P>
   To accelerate the natural process of decomposition, use a drill
to bore holes as deeply as possible into the stump. A circular saw
or even a hatchet can be used to cut and rough up the exterior.
Next, sprinkle a layer of ``woods dirt'' _ the top layer of soil on
the ground beneath your trees _ over the stump, packing it into any
holes in the wood. Then sprinkle a cup of 10-10-10 fertilizer over
the stump and lightly mist everything with water.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the stump warm, cover it with clear polyethylene
plastic, anchored with rocks and limbs. The plastic will trap solar
heat underneath and make the stump a cozy home for the organisms
that will feed on it. If you wish, plant morning glory, purple
hyacinth of English ivy to hide the stump and plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, the stump will be well on its way from your
property.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the upshot of the arrest in Miami of Andy Pargh, the
``Gadget Guru'' on NBC's ``Today'' show? The story was in the news
in early December, but I never saw a followup.
</P>
<P>
   A: The case doesn't appear to have been resolved, according to
the Miami-Dade Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Pargh was arrested Dec. 4 in Sunny Isles, Fla., just north of
Miami Beach, and charged with one count of cocaine trafficking. He
was released on $50,000 bond four hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded information at the Dade County clerk's office reported
Tuesday that the case was adjudicated guilty, and a report hearing
will be held on Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Pargh, meanwhile, no longer appears on NBC's morning show. His
Web site _ www.gadgetguru.com/ _ says this: ``We appreciate the
support you have given the Gadget Guru over the last 15 years. The
Gadget Guru is taking some time off . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that Billy Graham paid $80,000 to rent the
Georgia Dome five years ago, the Southern Baptist Convention paid
``nearly twice that'' for the facility last year, and Bishop T.D.
Jakes paid $75,000 for his recent ``Woman, Thou Art Loosed!''
conference. How much did the National Football League pay to use
the Dome for Super Bowl XXXIV?
</P>
<P>
   A: The tab was $253,500, said Dome spokesman Matt Garvey. But he
wanted to clarify one point: It was the Metro Atlanta Super Bowl
Host Committee, and not the NFL, that paid the rental fee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Dick Cheney may be the next vice president. How did he avoid
military service during the Vietnam War?
</P>
<P>
   A: This subject came under close scrutiny when Cheney was
nominated to be secretary of defense in 1989. According to draft
records, he received deferments first as a student, then as a
father.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by the Associated Press, a longtime friend, Joe
Meyer, dismissed any notion that Cheney pulled strings to avoid the
service. Meyer, who roomed with Cheney in college in Wyoming and
now is Wyoming's secretary of state, said Cheney wasn't very well
known at that time, and his father, local administrator for the
U.S. Soil Conservation Service, hardly had major political
influence.
</P>
<P>
   According to draft records, Cheney was deemed available for
military service in February 1962 after he dropped out of Yale
University. In March 1963, while enrolled at Casper College in
Wyoming, he was granted his first student deferment. It was renewed
while he was at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. Upon
graduation in May 1965, he again was declared available for
military service, but received another student deferment when he
became a graduate student in political science that fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lew Brodsky, director of public and congressional affairs for
the Selective Service, told the AP that student draft deferments
were common. ``Most men who were in school automatically qualified
for the 2-S deferment, which was the classic student deferment at
the time,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   When Lynne Cheney became pregnant with their first daughter,
Cheney received his final draft deferment in January 1966.
Elizabeth Cheney was born on July 26, 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called hardship deferment enacted in 1963 included
fathers living with their children. The provision was terminated in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We travel the East Coast a lot. Where can we get a listing of
all the participating stations that broadcast Atlanta Braves games?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can find a Braves network list online at this site:
www.atlantabraves.com/bravespbtvradio/0,1800,49,00.html. On the
map, click on any state and you'll see the city, radio station call
letters and location on the dial.

   DRLAURA-DUEL _ Conservative family-advice givers Dr. Laura and

   BAT-PROJECT _ SAN LUIS VALLEY, Colo. _ When San Luis Valley
residents wake up each morning, there are 2 tons fewer bugs outside
than there were the night before. Tons of bugs disappear each
night, especially in summer, not that the farmers mind. They're
glad, and so is everyone else. And the fact that they have bats to
thank for the insect eradication doesn't seem to bother anyone.
Bats, it turns out, aren't the bloodthirsty villains often
portrayed in books and movies. They're vital to many Colorado
ecosystems and, in the case of the San Luis Valley, vital to the
economy because of crops saved from insects. And bats are being
unintentionally exterminated. Throughout the United States,
destruction of bat habitat is driving them into abandoned mines. In
the last 20 years, mines have been closed to ensure public safety,
but with little thought to the bats possibly living inside. (Grand

   DRLAURA-DUEL _ Conservative family-advice givers Dr. Laura and
John Rosemond are locking horns over daycare. Laura says it's
always bad; Rosemond isn't so sure. This points up a difference
that divides even conserative soul-mates: Laura puts the child at
the center of the universe and Rosemond puts the parents there. We
also inquire of parents: What does this dispute say about the value
of parenting experts, whose advice floods the media? (Harris,
Atlanta JOurnal-Constitution). 30.

<P>
   LAURABUSH-SUITS _ People expect a first lady, whether of Texas
or of the United States, to have a certain look _ feminine,
professional and conservative, regardless of her political
leanings. Should she monkey with that formula even a tad, they'll
let her know. Dallas designer Michael Faircloth creates the outfits
that Laura Bush wears for public appearances, including the
half-dozen suits she packed for last week's Republican National
Convention. (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post). 19. WITH PHOTOS.

   BAT-PROJECT _ SAN LUIS VALLEY, Colo. _ When San Luis Valley
residents wake up each morning, there are 2 tons fewer bugs outside
than there were the night before. Tons of bugs disappear each
night, especially in summer, not that the farmers mind. They're
glad, and so is everyone else. And the fact that they have bats to
thank for the insect eradication doesn't seem to bother anyone.
Bats, it turns out, aren't the bloodthirsty villains often
portrayed in books and movies. They're vital to many Colorado
ecosystems and, in the case of the San Luis Valley, vital to the
economy because of crops saved from insects. And bats are being
unintentionally exterminated. Throughout the United States,
destruction of bat habitat is driving them into abandoned mines. In
the last 20 years, mines have been closed to ensure public safety,
but with little thought to the bats possibly living inside. (Grand
Junction Daily Sentinel). 30.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com. Please include your name and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that people who are in their homes during storms
when lightning occurs should stay away from windows, because
lightning can strike through the glass. If that's the case, why are
we considered safe in cars when lightning strikes?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not the glass that protects you in a car, it's the car's
metal frame, said Greg Forbes of The Weather Channel. Metal is an
excellent conductor, and the lightning current normally will flow
through the car frame to the axles, then to the wheel rims, then
arc to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   People are relatively safe from lightning inside their homes as
long as they aren't in contact with some of the most likely routes
that lightning might take through the house, such as pipes and
wires, Forbes added.
</P>
<P>
   While lightning can go through window glass, it's more likely to
find some other path, because glass isn't a good conductor. It's
more likely to hit the roof, than go horizontally through the
window. Being away from the exterior walls _ windows included _
isn't a bad idea, though, because it puts you farther from the
lightning strike outside.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes added these additional safety tips: Don't talk on the
telephone (an electrical current from the lightning may travel down
the wire); don't take a bath or shower (because an electrical
current may travel along the pipes); and don't touch appliances (a
current may go through your home's electrical wiring into them).
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the hurricane season just starting, is there an online
site where one can obtain a hurricane tracking map on which to
follow them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several sites offer good hurricane tracking information,
including these:
http://lumahai.soest.hawaii.edu/TropicalWeather/atlantictrack.gif;
http://hurricane.terrapin.com/;
www.nwrc.nbs.gov/special/track2.html; www.nws.noaa.gov/.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw where Melissa Manchester's father was a bassoonist with
the Metropolitan Opera orchestra. Is that where she got her
interest in music?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. According to biographical information on the
singer-songwriter's official Web site _ www.melissa-manchester.com/
_ her father introduced her to all the classics, and by the age of
15 she already was a published poet.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Feb. 15, 1951, in New York, she graduated from the High
School of the Performing Arts, where she studied acting. After
that, she entered New York University School of the Arts and
enrolled in a songwriting class taught by Paul Simon. She landed a
staff writing job at Chappel Music and performed as a solo
singer-pianist in clubs in Greenwich Village and on Manhattan's
Upper West Side, where she met Bette Midler _ soon becoming
Midler's backup singer. Within six months Manchester had a
recording contract, was a headliner at Carnegie Hall, and was on
her way.
</P>
<P>
   Her Web site, by the way, doesn't mention her mother or other
family members. ``The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock &AMP; Soul'' also
mentions only her father.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To what political party does Alan Greenspan belong? What
president appointed him to his current position?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to Current Biography Yearbook, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve System is a moderate Republican. He was nominated
by President Reagan on June 2, 1987, and was renominated in 1991 by
President Bush and again in 1996 by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you settle a friendly discussion? How many continents are
there, what are they, and what is the authoritative source for this
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: World Book Encyclopedia, The New Encyclopedia Britannica, the
Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Geography and Random House
Unabridged Dictionary all say there are seven: Asia, Africa, North
America, South America, Antarctica, Europe and Australia (listed in
order of size). Technically Europe isn't a continent, but a
peninsula of Asia, in which case the combined continent is called
Eurasia _ and there would be six.
</P>
<P>
   The islands of the Pacific, or Oceania, aren't part of any
continent. Australia is sometimes considered part of Oceania, but
Oceania isn't a continent on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you do if the Census Bureau hasn't sent anything in
the mail or come to your residence to count you?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Census Bureau says people who didn't receive a
questionnaire and weren't contacted by an enumerator should contact
their local census office and ask for field operations. The
regional census center for your state should be found in the
government section (blue pages) of the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several years ago, Q&AMP;A answered a question about some
relatives of Queen Mother Elizabeth having been put in a mental
hospital in England in the 1940s, with their existence never
acknowledged. Can you refresh my memory about that? Have there been
any new developments?
</P>
<P>
   A: The London Observer revived the subject in an article in late
July, but it added little to the reports that came to light in
1987. At that time, the news leaked out that Katherine and Nerissa
Bowes-Lyon, nieces of the Queen Mother, had been confined in the
Royal Earlswood Mental Hospital in Surrey for 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's Peerage, the guidebook to aristocratic lineage, had
recorded the sisters as having died in 1940 and 1961, which turned
out to be false. Nerissa Bowes-Lyon died in 1986. There has been no
mention of the fate of her sister, Katherine, so it's assumed that
she is still living.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, daughters of John Herbert Bowes-Lyon, the Queen
Mother's late brother, and Fenella Trefusis, a daughter of the 21st
Baron Clinton, were committed secretly to the hospital in 1941 by
their mother. Three other women, cousins of the Bowes-Lyons sisters
and daughters of Harriet Fane, sister-in-law of the Queen Mother,
also were placed in the hospital in 1941. Two were still living in
1987, but nothing about them has been reported since.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogists said all five may have shared a genetic flaw passed
by the 21st Baron Clinton, and not the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The recent London Observer report added one bit of information:
that the 99-year-old Princess Alice, duchess of Gloucester, who is
Queen Elizabeth's aunt and sister-in-law of the Queen Mother,
remains ``hidden'' in Kensington Palace in west London. A
Buckingham Palace official said she was ``with us some of the time,
but not at others.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the number of delegates to the Republican and
Democratic national political conventions determined? Is it based
on population, number of voters, or what?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each party has its own formula, resulting in ever-changing
numbers of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, each state receives a base of six
delegates-at-large. American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands
each receive a base of four, while the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico are allotted 14. Each state also receives three
congressional district delegates for each representative it has in
the U.S. House, regardless of political affiliation (not applicable
to American Samoa and the others). Then there are ``bonus
delegates'' awarded based on various factors, such as to those
states whose electoral votes were cast for Bob Dole in 1996, or to
those states electing a Republican senator or governor during
specific years.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party introduced a formula in the 1960s that
still calculates the base delegate allocation per state. The
formula involves the total number of Democratic votes in the last
three presidential elections of each state, added to the state's
total electoral vote. On top of that is the ``superdelegate''
number _ now known as the PLEO, or Party Leader and/or Elected
Official _ which was added beginning with the 1984 Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen any mention of Nancy Coverdell in the media
since her husband, Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), died suddenly.
Where is she? Any news to report?
</P>
<P>
   A: She's living in the couple's home in Washington, helping to
close out her late husband's Senate office. Georgia Republican
leaders have been very protective of Nancy Coverdell and her
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the name of Philadelphia's Hahnemann University
Hospital, where former President Gerald Ford was treated after a
stroke, come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Samuel Hahnemann was a German physician and medical reformer
who died in 1843 _ five years before a college in Philadelphia
bearing his name was born.
</P>
<P>
   He was considered the ``father of homeopathy,'' a system of
medical treatment relying on the body's basic power to heal itself,
as opposed to ``heroic'' medical practices of the time such as
bleeding, purging and leeching.
</P>
<P>
   The present institution began as Homeopathic Medical College of
Pennsylvania, founded in 1848 by three young doctors, Jacob Jeanes,
Walter Williamson and Constantine Hering. The new enterprise for
healing arts prospered and grew. In 1884, the college joined forces
with the Homeopathic Hospital of Pennsylvania under the name of The
Hahnemann Medical College &AMP; Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the college's centennial year, Hahnemann's Dr. Charles
P. Bailey performed the world's first successful valvular surgery
within the human heart, the repair of a mitral valve. Bailey's
research was the subject of a Time cover story in 1957.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When Tiger Woods first came to prominence and was asked about
his race, he said that he was a mix _ and, for fun, had made up a
word to describe his racial heritage. I believe the word was
``Cablanasian.'' Can you break down the term Woods uses, and
explain its components?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's spelled Cablinasian, which the golfer cobbled together
from these words: Caucasian, black, Indian, Asian.
</P>
<P>
   According to Current Biography Yearbook's entry on Woods, his
father, Earl Woods, is one-quarter Chinese, one-quarter American
Indian, and half black. His mother, Kultilda Punsawad Woods, is
half Thai, a quarter Chinese and a quarter white.
</P>
<P>
   As golf's most prominent athlete of multiracial heritage, Tiger
Woods has been criticized on occasion for not identifying himself
as black. But he usually refuses to weigh any aspect of his lineage
more heavily than any other, and maintains that he considers the
focus on his race insulting. ``I don't want to be the best black
golfer ever,'' he often says. ``I want to be the best golfer
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the phrase ``life of Riley,'' as in the expression
``living the life of Riley,'' originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: As with many expressions, there are several theories about
the origin. Perhaps the most prevalent is that it comes from a
comic song written by Pat Rooney of the ``Dancing Rooneys'' in the
1880s and performed by him on the vaudeville circuit. The song's
hero, Riley, tells of what he would do if he struck it rich: He
promises that New York ``will swim in wine when the White House and
Capitol are mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that it traces to poet James Whitcomb
Riley (1849-1916), whose simple, sentimental poems depicting the
lives of barefoot boys loafing and living a life of ease in the
summer were immensely popular at the time the phrase came into use.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another possibility is the turn-of-the-century tune ``The
Best in the House Is None Too Good for Reilly,'' although the
change of spelling is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The books ``Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase
Origins'' and ``Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins,''
readily available at libraries, explain such things as this.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember that about 25 years ago, during a drought, the
government sent some supersonic airplanes overhead to stir up the
atmosphere with a sonic boom and create rain. It worked, as I
recall, because rain began to fall soon afterward. Am I right?
</P>
<P>
   A: A sonic boom would have had no impact on the changing weather
pattern, according to Colin Marquis, senior meteorologist at The
Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about Chandi Heffner, the adopted
daughter of Doris Duke? As I recall, they didn't split amicably.
</P>
<P>
   A: Charlene Gail ``Chandi'' Heffner, a former belly dancer and
Hare Krishna devotee, stays out of the public eye. But some things
about her relationship with the tobacco heiress are documented.
</P>
<P>
   Heffner was 35 when she was adopted by Duke in 1988. By February
1991, Heffner was persona non grata on the Duke property and Duke
was quoted as saying the adoption was ``the greatest mistake I ever
made in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke died Oct. 28, 1993, having disinherited Heffner and leaving
the bulk of her fortune to various charities and educational
foundations. Heffner sued, seeking to become the beneficiary of the
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, it was reported that Heffner had settled her claims
for $65 million, and she hasn't been in the news since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Confederate submarine Hunley, which sank in the harbor
at Charleston, S.C., in 1864, was built in Mobile, Ala., how was it
transported to Charleston, where it sank?
</P>
<P>
   A: By train. Records show that it was secured on two railroad
flatcars for the trip, said Faith Colaluca of Friends of the
Hunley, a nonprofit organization created by the state of South
Carolina to raise public and private funds for the recovery of the
submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a new first-time homeowner and am having a lot of
difficulty removing tree stumps. My father claims to have seen a
newspaper article with a recipe for dissolving them. What can you
tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: Walter Reeves, a University of Georgia horticulture educator,
says commercial products promise to decompose roots rapidly by
chemical action. As an alternative, he suggests letting insects and
fungi consume the tissue of the stump naturally, converting it to
soil humus.
</P>
<P>
   To accelerate the natural process of decomposition, use a drill
to bore holes as deeply as possible into the stump. A circular saw
or even a hatchet can be used to cut and rough up the exterior.
Next, sprinkle a layer of ``woods dirt'' _ the top layer of soil on
the ground beneath your trees _ over the stump, packing it into any
holes in the wood. Then sprinkle a cup of 10-10-10 fertilizer over
the stump and lightly mist everything with water.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the stump warm, cover it with clear polyethylene
plastic, anchored with rocks and limbs. The plastic will trap solar
heat underneath and make the stump a cozy home for the organisms
that will feed on it. If you wish, plant morning glory, purple
hyacinth of English ivy to hide the stump and plastic.

   Within a year, the stump will be well on its way from your

<P>
   Q: What was the upshot of the arrest in Miami of Andy Pargh, the
``Gadget Guru'' on NBC's ``Today'' show? The story was in the news
in early December, but I never saw a followup.
</P>
<P>
   A: The case doesn't appear to have been resolved, according to
the Miami-Dade Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Pargh was arrested Dec. 4 in Sunny Isles, Fla., just north of
Miami Beach, and charged with one count of cocaine trafficking. He
was released on $50,000 bond four hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded information at the Dade County clerk's office reported
Tuesday that the case was adjudicated guilty, and a report hearing
will be held on Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Pargh, meanwhile, no longer appears on NBC's morning show. His
Web site _ www.gadgetguru.com/ _ says this: ``We appreciate the
support you have given the Gadget Guru over the last 15 years. The
Gadget Guru is taking some time off . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that Billy Graham paid $80,000 to rent the
Georgia Dome five years ago, the Southern Baptist Convention paid
``nearly twice that'' for the facility last year, and Bishop T.D.
Jakes paid $75,000 for his recent ``Woman, Thou Art Loosed!''
conference. How much did the National Football League pay to use
the Dome for Super Bowl XXXIV?
</P>
<P>
   A: The tab was $253,500, said Dome spokesman Matt Garvey. But he
wanted to clarify one point: It was the Metro Atlanta Super Bowl
Host Committee, and not the NFL, that paid the rental fee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Dick Cheney may be the next vice president. How did he avoid
military service during the Vietnam War?
</P>
<P>
   A: This subject came under close scrutiny when Cheney was
nominated to be secretary of defense in 1989. According to draft
records, he received deferments first as a student, then as a
father.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by the Associated Press, a longtime friend, Joe
Meyer, dismissed any notion that Cheney pulled strings to avoid the
service. Meyer, who roomed with Cheney in college in Wyoming and
now is Wyoming's secretary of state, said Cheney wasn't very well
known at that time, and his father, local administrator for the
U.S. Soil Conservation Service, hardly had major political
influence.
</P>
<P>
   According to draft records, Cheney was deemed available for
military service in February 1962 after he dropped out of Yale
University. In March 1963, while enrolled at Casper College in
Wyoming, he was granted his first student deferment. It was renewed
while he was at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. Upon
graduation in May 1965, he again was declared available for
military service, but received another student deferment when he
became a graduate student in political science that fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lew Brodsky, director of public and congressional affairs for
the Selective Service, told the AP that student draft deferments
were common. ``Most men who were in school automatically qualified
for the 2-S deferment, which was the classic student deferment at
the time,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   When Lynne Cheney became pregnant with their first daughter,
Cheney received his final draft deferment in January 1966.
Elizabeth Cheney was born on July 26, 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called hardship deferment enacted in 1963 included
fathers living with their children. The provision was terminated in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We travel the East Coast a lot. Where can we get a listing of
all the participating stations that broadcast Atlanta Braves games?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can find a Braves network list online at this site:
www.atlantabraves.com/bravespbtvradio/0,1800,49,00.html. On the
map, click on any state and you'll see the city, radio station call
letters and location on the dial.

Emma Curtis-White lead congregations within blocks of each other in
Dayton, Ohio. Only Johnson was ordained in the Southern Baptist
Church, but all three are troubled by the Southern Baptist

   JERUSALEM _ Their common enemies are microscopic. Their team
consists of both Arabs and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine has long been one field that crossed lines between
Israelis and Palestinians. Building on that tradition, the Kuvin
Centre(CQ) for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, based
at Israel's Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has projects ranging
from Israel to Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world doesn't know these things go on,'' said Dr. Sanford
Kuvin, a Palm Beach, Fla. infectious disease specialist who founded
the center in 1976. His explanation for the teamwork is simple:
``Mosquitoes don't recognize borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuvin, 70, knows mosquitoes. In 1962, he helped develop an
antibody test for malaria, a major breakthrough in detecting the
mosquito-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
   He has testified before the U.S. Congress about AIDS and
Hepatitis B policy. And he was the medical advisor to Kimberly
Bergalis, a Florida woman who died after becoming the first
confirmed case of a patient contracting AIDS from her dentist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Kuvin came to Israel to meet with colleagues and saw
the potential for research in a country with high medical standards
in a region with many tropical diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He set up the center in 1976. It became a lead agency in the
fight against the Rift Valley Fever, which killed thousands of
Egyptians and threatened to eliminate Egypt's cattle stock in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration between Israeli and Egyptian health workers
coincided with the peace process between their two countries.
Together, they vaccinated every head of cattle in Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, with money from the U.S. Agency for
International Development, the European Union and the German
Science Foundation, the Kuvin Centre has worked in several
countries _ including Greece, Mali, Jordan and Brazil. It also
works on projects with countries where Israel does not have full
relations _ such as Morocco and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the focus is on leishmaniasis(CQ), a disease that
can cause disfiguring boils and, in a less common form, death. The
disease afflicts 400,000 people a year, mainly in the Mediterranean
region, Latin America and India.
</P>
<P>
   It is carried by parasites in sand flies. The flies bite
animals, including dogs, which are then infected and carry the
disease. Other flies spread it from the infected animals to humans.
There are cures, but they involve highly toxic drugs that can
damage organs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers collect sand fly larvae from the West Bank and
Israel, study the flies' behavior and genetic make-up. The goal is
to control the spread of the disease and find better cures.
</P>
<P>
   The project is based at the Kuvin Centre, but includes the
Palestinian Al-Quds University.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are applying for grant money to expand the
project, including a Palestinian clinic for treating and
researching the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ziad Abdeen, dean of research at Al-Quds and the Palestinian
coordinator on the project, said such cooperative projects used to
be frowned upon by other Palestinians. Now, with the school
involved in more than 52 joint projects, Palestinians recognize
that such efforts are ``good for Palestinians and good for the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not all science,'' he said of his relations with his
Israeli peers. ``They get to know our attitudes, our culture.
Through collaboration you get to understanding, and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The skills Palestinians learn researching leishmaniasis can be
used on other diseases, improving the young crop of Palestinian
healthworkers in their new health system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not feel inferior. I have studied at some of the best
schools in the world. But, my system is inferior. We do not have
the facilities,'' Abdeen said.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Unlike Fox Mulder of The X-Files, Russian mathematician
Alexander Golod doesn't believe the truth is out there _ he says
it's in there.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-story gray pyramid, to be precise, that rises
majestically _ and unexpectedly _ from a forest-lined potato field
alongside the main highway leading north from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Golod, an academic turned businessman, built the structure
because he believes in what he calls ``Pyramid Power,'' a force
that mankind can harness to cure AIDS and eliminate crime, civil
war, bad harvests, cancer and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a faith healer, I am a scientist,'' said Golod, a
scruffy, pale man whose long face exudes contentment. ``As a result
of this pyramid being built, I predict that AIDS and hepatitis will
disappear (in the Moscow region) in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   His predictions are based, he says, not on the supernatural but
on scientific truths and mathematical theorems that humans do not
yet understand. All you have to do, he says, is believe.
</P>
<P>
   And thousands of Russians, bored or disenchanted with
traditional religions, do, making Golod's pyramids _ he's already
built eight _ Meccas of the paranormal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drank the water, and I lost my headaches. I bought the
stones, and my garden bloomed,'' said a 44-year-old woman named
Lena, referring to the amulets she bought after they had been
``charged'' inside Golod's pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   As she stood in line on a recent rainy afternoon to visit the
hollow, fiberglass structure, Lena was happy to talk about her
belief in the pyramid's healing powers but refused to give her last
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go so far as to say it's a holy place, but there is a
current of energy that is unmistakable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Golod, who owns a used tire business and is a military defense
contractor, says the cosmos suffers disease and war because space
is distorted by negative human actions. He claims the pyramid's
measurements, based on ancient mathematical equations used by the
Egyptians, re-balance cosmic forces within the pyramid itself.
According to this logic, the bigger the pyramid, the bigger is its
influence on the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow pyramid _ completed last December _ is Golod's
largest and most expensive project. Built without nails, the
structure took almost two years and $800,000 to complete, he says.
Costs for the others averaged about $125,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Golod's most famous pyramid is on Lake Seliger in northern
Russia, a site he chose because it was located under a hole in the
ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months after we built this in 1997, the hole was back
to normal,'' he says excitedly, displaying what he says are before
and after pictures taken by Russian weather satellites. ``Just
think of what would happen if we built a bigger (pyramid) in the
Southern Hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You Americans, you could rid yourself of tornadoes with a few
of these,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Golod's ideas have been embraced by Russian cosmonauts, medical
doctors and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of amethysts charged at the Moscow pyramid were taken
aboard the space station Mir to promote world peace. And Russia's
Olympic rowers and wrestlers are taking Golod's rocks to the Sydney
Games this summer, hoping the stones will aid their performances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some visitors to the pyramid are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Sechin, a 31-year-old father of one, was one of hundreds of
people who came on a recent weekend to visit the pyramid out of
curiosity. He said the trip didn't make him a believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of people who believe that pyramid will cure them are
the kind of people that will believe anything. Only those kind of
people would buy this junk,'' Sechin said, pointing to the $10
model pyramids and $1 bottles of pyramid water sold outside.
</P>
<P>
   Golod rejects charges of hucksterism. He produces reams of paper
with test results from Moscow research institutes to support his
claims that pyramids affect the natural world. A study last year by
the Moscow Institute for Experimental and Theoretical Biophysics
found that water exposed to the pyramids has ``a stimulating effect
on the ability of human cells to survive and proliferate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take me 30 years (of selling souvenirs) to recoup my
costs,'' he said, sitting in his rundown Moscow office decorated
with a five-foot-tall plastic globe. ``I'm doing what I can to
improve the planet. There is no escaping that we are all connected
to its future. I want to make the Earth a better place for my
grandchildren to live.''

   JERUSALEM _ Their common enemies are microscopic. Their team
consists of both Arabs and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine has long been one field that crossed lines between
Israelis and Palestinians. Building on that tradition, the Kuvin
Centre(CQ) for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, based
at Israel's Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has projects ranging
from Israel to Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world doesn't know these things go on,'' said Dr. Sanford
Kuvin, a Palm Beach, Fla. infectious disease specialist who founded
the center in 1976. His explanation for the teamwork is simple:
``Mosquitoes don't recognize borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuvin, 70, knows mosquitoes. In 1962, he helped develop an
antibody test for malaria, a major breakthrough in detecting the
mosquito-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
   He has testified before the U.S. Congress about AIDS and
Hepatitis B policy. And he was the medical advisor to Kimberly
Bergalis, a Florida woman who died after becoming the first
confirmed case of a patient contracting AIDS from her dentist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Kuvin came to Israel to meet with colleagues and saw
the potential for research in a country with high medical standards
in a region with many tropical diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He set up the center in 1976. It became a lead agency in the
fight against the Rift Valley Fever, which killed thousands of
Egyptians and threatened to eliminate Egypt's cattle stock in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration between Israeli and Egyptian health workers
coincided with the peace process between their two countries.
Together, they vaccinated every head of cattle in Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, with money from the U.S. Agency for
International Development, the European Union and the German
Science Foundation, the Kuvin Centre has worked in several
countries _ including Greece, Mali, Jordan and Brazil. It also
works on projects with countries where Israel does not have full
relations _ such as Morocco and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the focus is on leishmaniasis(CQ), a disease that
can cause disfiguring boils and, in a less common form, death. The
disease afflicts 400,000 people a year, mainly in the Mediterranean
region, Latin America and India.
</P>
<P>
   It is carried by parasites in sand flies. The flies bite
animals, including dogs, which are then infected and carry the
disease. Other flies spread it from the infected animals to humans.
There are cures, but they involve highly toxic drugs that can
damage organs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers collect sand fly larvae from the West Bank and
Israel, study the flies' behavior and genetic make-up. The goal is
to control the spread of the disease and find better cures.
</P>
<P>
   The project is based at the Kuvin Centre, but includes the
Palestinian Al-Quds University.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are applying for grant money to expand the
project, including a Palestinian clinic for treating and
researching the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ziad Abdeen, dean of research at Al-Quds and the Palestinian
coordinator on the project, said such cooperative projects used to
be frowned upon by other Palestinians. Now, with the school
involved in more than 52 joint projects, Palestinians recognize
that such efforts are ``good for Palestinians and good for the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not all science,'' he said of his relations with his
Israeli peers. ``They get to know our attitudes, our culture.
Through collaboration you get to understanding, and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The skills Palestinians learn researching leishmaniasis can be
used on other diseases, improving the young crop of Palestinian
healthworkers in their new health system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not feel inferior. I have studied at some of the best
schools in the world. But, my system is inferior. We do not have
the facilities,'' Abdeen said.

<P>
   It's not easy to make good meatballs if the amount of fat in the
ground beef is small. If you take fat away you have to add
something to take its place. So perhaps the name I have given this
recipe for meatballs is not fair. The additions, fresh tomatoes,
parsley and basil, are not exactly the ingredients found in
old-fashioned meatballs.
</P>
<P>
   But they serve a double purpose: they add moisture and keep the
meatballs light, and they add a great deal of flavor. It's like
having meatballs with the tomato sauce inside.
</P>
<P>
   Potato salad swathed in a mayonnaise dressing is usually the
summer salad of choice, but the old-fashioned version would not
exactly fit into the healthy menu category. If you use oil and
vinegar you can definitely cut down on the calories. Putting
broccoli in a potato salad is the easiest way I know to make
broccoli palatable to almost anyone. To me its gives an interesting
texture to the salad and wonderful color. The acidity of the
vinegar, the sharpness of the mustard and the touch of sweetness
and complexity of the Worcestershire sauce counteract the cabbagey
taste of broccoli that some people don't like.
</P>
<P>
   Let's call this meal a new age version of old-fashioned food.
</P>
<P>
   OLD-FASHIONED MEATBALLS
</P>
<P>
   16 ounces 10 percent fat ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   Enough parsley to yield 1/3 cup chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces ripe tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Bunch basil to yield 6 large leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 large sprig oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 large garlic clove
</P>
<P>
   1. Wash, dry and chop parsley; wash, trim and finely chop the
tomatoes; wash, dry and slice the basil leaves; wash dry and chop
the oregano; mince the garlic.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mix the ground beef with the bread crumbs and all the other
ingredients and shape into 1.5-inch balls.
</P>
<P>
   3. Heat a nonstick pan large enough to hold the meatballs in a
single layer. Reduce heat to medium high; add oil and saute the
meatballs on all sides until they are brown.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 3 servings
</P>
<P>
   BROCCOLI AND POTATO SALAD
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces small new potatoes
</P>
<P>
   16 ounces whole broccoli or 8 ounces broccoli florettes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1. Wash the potatoes; do not peel. If the potatoes are larger
than an inch in size, cut in half or quarters. Boil the potatoes
until they are cooked, 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut off tough stems from whole broccoli. Cut the florettes
into bite-size pieces and steam about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile whisk together the olive oil, vinegar,
Worcestershire and mustard in a serving bowl.
</P>
<P>
   4. When potatoes are cooked, drain and cut into bite-size
pieces. Stir into dressing.
</P>

   QIUBAN VILLAGE, China _ It's election day in this watermelon-
and peach-growing village of 660 people and the elementary school
is festooned with colorful flags. One by one, peasants file into a
classroom and step behind the pink sheets to enter the voting
booth.
</P>
<P>
   To Charles Costello, director of the Carter Center's Democracy
Program, those pink sheets are a small but sure sign that democracy
is developing in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most organized I've seen it,'' he said, looking at
villagers lined up outside to await their turn.
</P>
<P>
   Costello was impressed: Qiuban not only provided secret voting
booths, but when it was all over, ballots were sorted and counted
in public, each vote hand-tallied on a large piece of paper posted
on the wall while villagers watched under the beating sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it is the other way around _ public voting, secret
counting,'' according to a January Carter Center report.
</P>
<P>
   While all of China's 930,000 villages are required by a 1987 law
to hold elections for village chief, only an estimated one-third to
two-thirds have actually done so. And when they do, the elections
are often full of irregularities, not just on election day, but in
the whole nominating process leading up to the vote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most serious problems of village elections _
acknowledged even by Chinese officials _ is interference from local
Communist Party bureaucrats. They often make it clear to voters
which candidate to support; in some instances, they have even
kicked an elected village chief out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts both inside and outside of China believe the
decade-long experiment with village elections has yielded real
steps toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot say all these elections are just meaningless,''
said Yawei Liu, a history professor at Georgia Perimeter College
who helps lead the Carter Center's China village elections project.
``To a certain extent, that's true. But you've got to see the other
side of the coin. These elections have empowered the villagers.
They've become bolder in demanding better accountability, demanding
the party can't be there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what the party had in mind when it introduced village
elections in 1987. The Chinese leadership saw them as a way to
maintain control and stability in the restive countryside, where
three-quarters of the population lives. It was also a way to make
villagers more accepting of unpopular policies, such as increased
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a visit last week to three villages in Fujian province, the
Atlanta-based Carter Center, which is working with the Ministry of
Civil Affairs to computerize election data and develop voting
procedures, was treated to a stack of letters from villagers
complaining about manipulation of elections and other problems. Liu
saw that as a good sign _ that villagers take the elections
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Fujian is a prosperous coastal province that may be best known
for sending emigrants to every corner of the world. In the
countryside, peasants have enough to eat, children go to school,
young adults find jobs in nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
   But the villages still lag far behind urban areas. The road to
Qiuban is not paved. Of the 169 households, only about 20 have
phone lines. In Linxian village, portraits of Marx, Lenin and
Stalin hang on the classroom walls.
</P>
<P>
   In Qiuban, three men declared their candidacy for village chief
_ a farmer, a mini-bus driver and a shop owner _ none of them party
members. Official campaigning consisted of one evening of
speech-making and question-answering. A week later, all but 25 of
the 444 eligible voters cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   An edited video-tape of the speeches was shown to the Carter
Center delegation. For more than four hours, villagers peppered
candidates with questions: ``How will you raise our income?''
``What will you do for the elderly?'' ``How will you resolve
conflicts between the village committee and the party?'' ``How will
you fulfill your duties in the village if you work in town?''
</P>
<P>
   The three answered mostly with general pledges to do the best
job they can. In the end, a run-off had to be held between the
farmer and the mini-bus driver because neither got a majority.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   That Fujian is generally agreed to be leading this nation of 1.2
billion in electoral work is due perhaps to people like Zhang
Xiaogan, a 26-year veteran of the People's Liberation Army, who has
run the province's grassroots democratic work for 15 years as an
official of the Civil Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In response to villagers' complaints, he has helped implement
some fundamental changes, such as requiring public posting of
village finances and allowing villagers a say in who is selected
party chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide glasses for people in case they need them,'' he
says excitedly while giving a tour of a polling site to an
observer. ``For those who are illiterate and can't write the name,
we have teachers to help them. If they don't trust the teachers,
they can choose any two people they want.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Shi Tianjian, a professor of political science at Duke
University who has researched village elections, said villagers
need to vote several times before they grasp what elections can do
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you need three rounds of elections to make the Chinese
peasants realize this is their opportunity to get rid of the bad
guy and get the good guy in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shi believes China is developing along the lines of Taiwan and
South Korea, where pressure from the grassroots level eventually
brought about open elections and an end to their authoritarian
governments.
</P>
<P>
   In mainland China, after more than a decade of voting at the
village level, direct elections have just recently begun to trickle
to townships, the next administrative level.
</P>
<P>
   Whether village elections will indeed one day lead to the
dreaded ``D-word'' _ democracy _ is not something openly discussed
among Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Ministry of Civil Affair)'s perspective is, you don't
have to talk about what it's going to lead to,'' Liu said. ``You
de-emphasize the political meaning. The more you talk about it, the
more scared the opponents of those elections are going to become.
So you just keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, village democracy has been getting
attention not just from foreign NGOs but from scholarly circles
within China as well.
</P>
<P>
   An independent project to promote village autonomy was started
up last December under the Unirule Institute of Economics, a
liberal Beijing think tank. ``Univillage'' has run into a few
snags, including a lack of financing and the project head getting
detained by Beijing police for a few weeks in July.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhou Hongling, a former bank manager from Hebei who says he
has been working for democracy in China for many years, insists the
project is on track. To him, the countryside is China's best hope
of political reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too optimistic about working for democracy in the
cities,'' he said. ``But rural democratization will surpass urban
democratization.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then add, ``It already has.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lap robes were once a requisite of the carriage
trade for keeping clean, snug and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Riding in a horse-drawn carriage or an early automobile was apt
to be a wet, muddy or dusty experience.
</P>
<P>
   Lap robes kept passengers warm and saved their clothing from
dirt and wear. They were stored with the outside folded out, to
keep the inside clean.
</P>
<P>
   Carriage blankets, another name for lap robes, were also
considered part of the chic apparel of the day, often complementing
the owner's wardrobe, or the lining of the carriage, sleigh or
auto.
</P>
<P>
   Lap robes came in a variety of materials. Some were faced with
leather, generally pigskin, and lined with plaid worsted material
or fur such as bear, buffalo or fox.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they remain popular for warmth during a football game or
polo match, to picnic on, snuggle up with a favorite book or for
use when the power goes out.
</P>
<P>
   Pendleton lap robes (at retail stores or http://nwpendleton.com)
have made the transition from drafty automobiles to a casual drape
over the back of a sofa or folded at the foot of the bed for an
afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   Some styles, such as the wide variety of woven cotton Irish
throws and crocheted afghans, are even considered works of art.
</P>
<P>
   For a luxurious lap robe, consider one made of cashmere.
Cashmereclub.com (http://cashmereclub.com) carries at least 16
colors (each costs approximately $798). Or consider a Polar Fleece
lap blanket in a solid or plaid ($20 to $33 at retail stores). Some
even feature a pocket for tucking your feet in to keep your toes
warm. When not in use, this pocket throw can be folded up to use as
a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   If you have allergies, look for a 100 percent non-allergenic
polyester Kanata fleece lap robe (at stores or
http://kanatablanket.com). It is brushed and sheared on both sides
for softness and pill resistance, and edged with whipstitching.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors might even wish to own a classic lap blanket and
carrying case in reversible plaid. That style was the regulation
Second Class Ticket Holder issue on the Titanic. To find it, go to
http://steamertrunkmerchants.com or call 212-585-4208.

<P>
   The madness on television has to stop. Did you know that on a
given day you can see:
</P>
<P>
   _ An Italian playing a mobster?
</P>
<P>
   _ An African-American or Hispanic playing a hoodlum?
</P>
<P>
   _ An Irishman in a bar, or one wearing a priest's collar?
</P>
<P>
   _ A blonde who's dumb?
</P>
<P>
   That's right, stereotypes all.
</P>
<P>
   People, or at least special-interest groups, are screaming. But
what they fail or refuse to recognize is that stereotypes are
sometimes _ but only sometimes, in individual cases _ true.
</P>
<P>
   When used to define an entire race, ethnicity or class, they are
obviously and categorically bankrupt. But does that mean television
and movies should never offer a portrayal that could be construed
as being stereotypical?
</P>
<P>
   The safe route many white television producers take is ``no,''
especially after they received a well-deserved hammering last year
on the lack of diversity in casting. Steven Bochco is a notable
exception. His diverse casts on ``Hill Street Blues,'' ``L.A.
Law,'' ``NYPD Blue'' and ``City of Angels'' (the latter featuring a
predominantly black cast and crew) gives him a justifiable free
pass.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is a rant on political correctness of Hollywood and the
ironic result: Minority actors are often excluded from some ``bad
guy'' roles by the push for inclusiveness that's supposed to help
them.
</P>
<P>
   Minority actors are getting it from both sides. Because (mostly
white) writers often ``write what they know,'' juicy parts for
blacks and Hispanics are often lacking, a paucity highlighted last
year by the NAACP and others. TV has worked hard over the past year
to play catch-up, at least numerically. It can do better
(especially with Hispanics).
</P>
<P>
   But the diversity question results in another byproduct that
actually hurts minorities. Because there have been so few roles for
blacks and Hispanics, advocacy groups often demand that people of
color be put into parts that are more role models than just good
roles. If there's an opening on a television drama for a precinct
captain or judge, any African-American of the right age who ever
did a school play should apply.
</P>
<P>
   What about HBO's great miniseries ``The Corner,'' which depicted
the seedy, drug-ridden side of Baltimore with a cast that was
almost entirely African-American? It took a black director, Charles
Dutton, to make that fascinating, grim project _ and don't think he
didn't get flak for it. Needless to say, it would never would have
aired on a broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is double-barreled. First, ``hero'' roles are often
one-dimensional, lacking the depth, complexity and edge that call
for a good actor to display their chops: The talented James
McDaniel, for example, could do so much more on ``NYPD Blue.''
Secondly, this means meaty or even pedestrian ``bad guy'' roles
often don't go to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   (This applies to commercials, as well. Ask yourself this
question: When was the last time you saw a minority cast as the
thief, burglar or other bad guy in a commercial? Think of the
recent beer ad in which a purse snatcher is knocked cold by a
flicked beer cap: Could you even imagine the perp being black? Not
in this environment.)
</P>
<P>
   Role-model roles? No. But they put food on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot ask every black actor or every writer to write
icons _ to write only (positive) representations of the black
community,'' said Lynne Thigpen, the Tony Award-winning
African-American actress who stars in the new CBS drama ``The
District.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time that we get to play people, and sometimes those
people are flawed. That doesn't mean you can never have a Hispanic
who murders someone, that everybody has to be white who murders
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen's comments have an interesting context. Despite its
diverse cast, ``The District'' is getting hammered for its premise:
A white police commissioner (Craig T. Nelson) comes to Washington
to clean up a failing _ and predominantly African-American _ police
force. Yes, the ``white knight'' aspect of the show makes me queasy
as well, although the producer said parts are being reworked before
airing.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen nails it: If television had a steady diet of nothing but
minorities-as-thugs, the outcry would be not only deafening but
unquestionably valid. To bend the other way _ to ignore reality, or
cower in the face of political forces, and deny minority actors
chances at jobs _ might not be as bad, but it's certainly
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, producers can blunt the ``no bad role models''
argument by creating more roles (especially leading parts) for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Furious advocacy groups are gaining momentum, and no one wants
to be left out. Italian-American organizations are going full-bore
against ``The Sopranos'' (ignoring the fact that the federal agents
who are the ``good guys'' of the series are Italians, as well).
</P>
<P>
   Things have gotten so surreal that the makers of ``Madigan
Men,'' a new ABC sitcom about an Irish father and son and
American-born grandson in New York City, had to fend off questions
from reporters about a scene in a bar (you know, the drinking
thing). And _ do you believe it? _ grandpa from off the boat wears
... a wool sweater. Shameless!
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a bit of a jump to go from bar to stereotype,''
said Gabriel Byrne, the show's Dublin-born star. ``There are
stereotypical characters that are dealt with in a stereotypical way
by inferior writers, and I don't think we're going to have that
problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral goal of all script writers should be to create a
fictional reality that at least resembles real life. But the truth
is that bad guys (and women) come in all colors; at times, the
stereotype overlaps with the specific and individual.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Italian mafia tend to be, well, Italian. Some
Irish men have been known to go to bars. And, yes, some blondes _
as well as brunettes, redheads, guys and television critics _ are
dumb.
</P>
<P>
   These ``stereotypes'' are indeed exceptions to the rule. But
there should be no rule against these exceptions.

&HT;     MEXICAN PRESIDENT-ELECT SEEKS A NORTH AMERICAN COMMON MARKET 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The North American Free Trade Agreement, enacted
in 1994, is widely credited with encouraging the reforms that led
to Vicente Fox's election last month as Mexico's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fox wants to expand the trade relationship between his
country, Canada and the United States, and possibly extend free
trade throughout South America. Fox is traveling in Argentina,
Brazil, Chile and Uruguay this week and will be in Ottawa and
Washington later this month discussing trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has proposed forming a common market similar to the European
Union, comprising the United States, Mexico and Canada, and
eventually linking such an organization with the budding South
American common market known as Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   A common market would go much further than NAFTA's abolition of
tariffs between its signatory parties. A North American common
market would more closely link Mexican, Canadian and American
economic and social policy, and would present a united front when
establishing trade pacts with other nations and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   As with the European Union, which is a 15-nation pact covering
much of Western Europe, a North American common market could also
lead to a common currency _ mostly likely the U.S. dollar _ and the
ability of workers in each country to freely move between the
others.
</P>
<P>
   It is these two points that will likely be Fox's main obstacles
both at home and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that it'll hurt the U.S. economy, which
is largely wrong in my opinion,'' said Steve Golub, an economics
professor at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. ``But another idea
is true: In industries where companies compete directly with
companies in those countries, it will hurt them, and they'll lobby
against it tooth and nail.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada may or may not be a willing partner. The original free
trade agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, when Conservative
Brian Mulroney was prime minister. After the agreement was enacted,
Mulroney was replaced by Liberal Jean Chretien. Chretien's minister
of foreign affairs, Lloyd Axworthy, was an ardent free trade
critic, though the new government has warmed to NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Trites, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade, points out that as president-elect, Fox has no
official standing to discuss policy with the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should these views become Mexican government policy, then
Canada will be pleased to examine any proposal put forward,''
Trites said. ``Until then, it would be premature to speculate on
such matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the
party Fox beat for the presidency, is likely to use its power in
the National Assembly to oppose replacing the peso with the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tradeoff there,'' Golub said. ``The benefit is you
get stable money and avoid crashes, and that can encourage
investment. The cost is a political cost. It's a huge chunk of
sovereignty you're giving up to the gringo dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox may be aided in his quest for a common market by the recent
``dollarization'' of Ecuador, and a proposal in Argentina to tie
that country's economy to the U.S. currency. But in those cases,
supporters opted for dollars because their own currencies were
weak.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's peso is relatively strong and weathered Fox's election
without the devaluation that often accompanies a presidential
transition.
</P>
<P>
   It is significant, observers say, that Fox chose to undertake
this foreign trade initiative a little more than a month after his
election victory and four months before Dec. 1, when he officially
assumes office.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fox's candidacy was linked early on with NAFTA. Not only is he a
former Coca-Cola executive with strong support for international
trade, but he was also a beneficiary of the government reforms
President Ernesto Zedillo instituted to encourage foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   This year saw Mexico's first-ever primary elections.
Traditionally, the president _ always a member of the PRI until Fox
ended the party's lock on power _ simply picked his successor.
Meanwhile, NAFTA has helped expand Mexico's middle class, which
boosted Fox's National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fox wants to do more. He argues a North American or
hemispheric common market would increase Mexico's standard of
living. Fox maintains that narrowing the gap in wages between
American and Mexican workers will slow illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   He will press that point in meetings with President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore in Washington on Aug. 24, and the next day
when he meets with GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   While both Gore and Bush favor NAFTA and free trade in general,
creating a common market would be a tough sell in Congress. Shoyer
said such an idea would ``raise a litany of controversies,''
including labor, environmental and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Golub agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will happen anytime soon,'' he said. ``Chile
wanted to get in on NAFTA a few years ago, and they deserved to,
but the U.S. didn't want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in a few years, if prosperity continues and it doesn't
look like the (trade) deal with China or NAFTA are hurting
industries, it might have a chance.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKLAND, Maine _ Marsha Demarest drove some 400 miles from
Hillsdale, N.J., to Maine, a state for which she has no particular
affection.
</P>
<P>
   She came for dinner. And she left more than satiated.
</P>
<P>
   Demarest was such a devotee of award-winning chef Melissa Kelly
when Kelly cooked at the Old Chatham Sheepherding Company Inn in
upstate New York that she didn't think twice about following her
palate to the chef's new restaurant, Primo, on the Maine coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that dinner. It'll be one of my greatest
warm, fuzzy memories when I'm an old lady,'' said Demarest, who
enjoyed a feast that Kelly cooked just for her because she had
driven all that way unaware that the restaurant's opening had been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival this season of Kelly _ named best chef in the
Northeast by the prestigious James Beard Foundation two years ago _
highlights how Maine is becoming a refuge for some of the nation's
rising-star chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Many are fleeing high-stress, manic New York kitchens, figuring
that if they are going to have to work punishing hours, they might
as well do it for themselves, and do it where they love to live. In
Maine they can be at once connected to the ocean that provides
their seafood and the small farms that produce their vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs are not the only ones benefitting. Their presence is
beginning to transform an area known primarily for its steamed
lobster and clamrolls, into a destination for ``foodies'' from near
and far.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with several fine restaurants lining the coast, the
culinary adventurer can feast on Primo's seared local halibut with
a sweet corn and lobster risotto. Or the apple wood grilled hanger
steak at Fore Street in Portland. Or the warm oil poached salmon in
a hot-and-sour broth at the Castine Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were intrigued by the idea of doing something you rarely
find in America, a great restaurant in the countryside,'' said
Clark Frasier, who is owner/chef of Arrows in Ogunquit along with
partner Mark Gaier. ``Ten years ago, it was a really odd concept in
this country, but it's getting more common.''
</P>
<P>
   And more choices are on the way. Matthew Kenney of Matthew's on
Manhattan's Upper East Side plans to open a restaurant in Portland
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   These are the days when the Food Network and food magazines have
mass audiences, when raddichio is a household word. People like
Demarest will travel for a great meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting all kinds of serious foods in places where you
didn't see it 20 years ago,'' said Peter Wells, a senior editor at
Food &AMP; Wine magazine. ``A great restaurant outside of a city can
flourish more easily. It used to be that it had to be noticed by
The New York Times to succeed. Now it doesn't have to languish
until someone comes along and makes it famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Maine's chefs said they were inspired by traditions
in France, where the vast majority of the highest-rated restaurants
_ those who have earned Michelin's three stars _ are outside of
Paris. Tow Gutow of the Castine Inn, for one, decided to
appropriate that model after cooking in some of those French
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, working in a small town poses obstacles not found in the
big city. Castine is five or six hours from Boston, a half-hour
from Route 1, and has no traffic light, fast food or movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gutow had worked with David Bouley, David Burke and
Diane Forley in New York, he was not a name like Kelly. So the
Castine Inn's reputation has evolved slowly since he and his wife,
Amy, bought it in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan native, the 30-year-old Gutow still relies more on
vacationers who happen to be in the area than on people who make
the trip just for his food. To a chef brimming with ambition, the
low profile sometimes hurts _ and it makes it a lot harder to
attract high-quality chefs to work under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to see the people I've worked with on the
cover of Food &AMP; Wine and Gourmet and The New York Times Magazine,
while I'm still every year struggling for staff,'' Gutow said. ``I
do wonder, if I stayed in New York, what would I be doing and who
would I be? But I'm still happy to be here, and I wouldn't go
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutow said he would rather raise his 19-month-old daughter in a
gorgeous small town than in New York City. He'd prefer to work
almost every hour of the day for himself than slave away in a
militaristic Manhattan kitchen, where the head chef is expected to
scream at everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   His life, indeed, is very different in rural Maine. He is active
in a local organization promoting organic foods. In the off-season,
he has slaughtered chickens _ to get as close as possible to the
food he cooks _ and taught English at a nearby high school. He
serves as a volunteer firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, 35, has had it somewhat easier, although she is just
getting started in Maine. Three of the cooks who worked under her
at her last job in upstate New York, moved to Maine with her. With
her prestigious award, and her work alongside big-name chefs like
Larry Forgione of An American Place and Alice Waters at Chez
Panisse in San Fransisco, Primo's debut has not been a quiet one in
Rockland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area is abuzz about Primo, there's no question about
that,'' said Greg Dugal of the Camden-Rockport-Lincolnville Chamber
of Commerce. ``I want to try it really badly, but I hear it takes
weeks to get a reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who grew up on Long Island, said that while she's happy
Primo has taken off quickly, she doesn't have ambition beyond the
60-seat restaurant. She and her fiance, baker and pastry chef Price
Kushner, might open a little bakery in addition to the restaurant.
That's about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our hopes and dreams. Not in another city; not in
another town,'' said Kelly, just before she began scouring for
sugar snap peas and carrots at the Camden Farmers' Market early on
a Saturday morning. ``I don't need to be a big-time chef, I really
don't. All I need is to have a little restaurant that makes people
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons these chefs chose their adopted home all revolve
around ocean and countryside and peace and quiet, but also food:
local hake and lobster and monkfish, local Swiss chard and green
beans and blueberries. The cold Maine environment actually yields
stronger, tastier produce, said Sam Hayward of Fore Street in
Portland, who was something of a pioneer chef when he came to Maine
22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All the chefs develop close relationships with their purveyors,
requesting certain crop varieties a season ahead of time, trading
the latest family news with their scallop divers, traveling to pick
up produce they can't get delivered.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, they say that their job is not to work magic
with obscure ingredients, but just to bring out the flavor of
simple foods. ``I want people to say, `This is what chicken tastes
like! This is the best chicken I've ever had,' '' Gutow said.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, though, that they do not find Maine without
blemishes. Hayward has boycotted varieties of seafood he believes
are being overfished. ``The ecological catastrophe in the Gulf of
Maine has been my biggest heartache,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these chefs consider themselves lucky. ``Always, chefs
work in the city but their dream is to get out into the country,''
said Kelly. ``Their dream is to be connected to the land, to have a
garden.''

OLYMPIC TRIALS POOL BRIMS WITH VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ There's no truth to the rumor that USA Swimming
was going to hold these Olympic trials at the senior citizens
center at the other end of Michigan Street. Not that it wasn't
tempted. There just weren't enough lockers.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here at the Indiana University Natatorium is
Jurassic Pool. Ron Karnaugh is 34. Three years ago, he was already
the oldest man to make a US world team. Angel Martino is 33, with a
3-year-old son. Dara Torres, also 33, is back after seven (that's
right, seven) years out of the water. Jon Olsen is 31, Lea Maurer
29, Jenny Thompson, Amy Van Dyken, and B.J. Bedford all 27.
</P>
<P>
   There are enough old folks here to qualify for a group rate on
the early-bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's comforting,'' said Bedford, the unsinkable backstroker
from Etna, N.H., who's here for a fourth try after three misses.
``I've got all my buddies with me. We've all cumulatively cried
enough tears to fill up that pool.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth time in five Olympiads that the trials have
been held in this chlorinated boombox. For some of the contenders _
like Torres, who's trying to become the first swimmer to compete in
four Games _ these next eight days could be a renaissance. For
others _ like Thompson, who didn't make the team in an individual
event last time _ they could be redemption.
</P>
<P>
   But for all but four dozen of the 1,300 qualifiers in 26 events,
this meet will yield little more than aching shoulders, a pat on
the back, and a soggy souvenir T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic trials is the hardest, most heartbreaking meet for
99 percent of the people out there,'' said Bedford, who came up
short in 1988, 1992, and 1996 but has a strong chance in the 100
backstroke this time. ``The people you're swimming with every day,
your friends, are all trying to knock you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the track and field version, the swimming trials are a
one-shot, no-appeal deal. But here, only the top two get tickets to
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can break 10 world records during the year,'' said Torres,
who's favored to win the 50 freestyle and could also make a couple
of relays. ``But if you come to trials and get third, that's it.
It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Last time, Thompson came with a legitimate shot to make the team
in seven events. But after finishing third in the 100 freestyle,
her best race, she came unglued and made only the relays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst meet I'd had in a long time, if ever,'' said
Thompson, who got three gold medals in Atlanta as consolation.
``After the 100, I had insomnia all week. It was stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who holds the American records in both the 100 free
and 100 butterfly, still could make the team in half a dozen
events. But she's taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People could come out of nowhere and make it, which happens
every single time,'' said Thompson, who's shooting for her third
team. ``And people who everyone thinks will make it, don't make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As they say on Wall Street, past performance is no guarantee of
future results. A bunch of medalists from Barcelona (Summer
Sanders, Mel Stewart, Tom Jager, Anita Nall, Lea Loveless) didn't
make the 1996 team. And a bunch who were on the podium in Atlanta
(Van Dyken, Martino, Amanda Beard, Gary Hall Jr., Brad Bridgewater,
Beth Botsford) will have to scramble to qualify here.
</P>
<P>
   The new quadrennium has brought fresh faces. Tom Wilkens is who
Tom Dolan was. Neil Walker is now the sprinter supreme. Lenny
Krayzelburg, who was born in the old Soviet Union, holds the world
record in both backstrokes. Ed Moses, who didn't begin swimming
seriously until he was 16, is now the man to beat in the 100
breaststroke. Megan Quann, who was 12 in 1996, rules the women's
100 breast.
</P>
<P>
   This should be their week, their meet, their team. But there's a
lot of water between should and did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's for sure,'' said Krayzelburg, ``until you touch the
wall.''

RETIREMENT WON'T HURT 53-YEAR-OLD'S LIFESTYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Can I retire in 10 years and live a lifestyle that will allow
me to travel, belong to a nice, but not exclusive, country club,
and, in general, live very well? Will the equivalent of $90,000 in
today's dollars be enough? I realize what I am asking is ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   C.N., Natick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course you will be able to retire comfortably, and it
shouldn't be ambiguous. If your portfolio growth averages 9.5
percent _ a figure I lowered from my customary 10 percent
projection because of the substantial amount in emergency savings _
you should accumulate $3,019,437 by 2010, presuming ongoing savings
of $32,100 a year.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation averages 3.5 percent, you would need $126,953 to
support a lifestyle equivalent to $90,000 today. You'd need only a
bit less than $2 million in a fixed-income portfolio to supply such
an income stream, presuming the fixed-income accounts produced an
average 6.5 percent yield. That would provide over $1 million to
leave in growth investments, protecting you against future
inflation. And since you plan to beging drawing Social Security at
age 66, it should be a long time before you'd need the money that's
designed to buffer you from long-term inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Will you be comfortable in retirement on the equivalent of
$90,000 in today's money? Look at it this way. Discounting the
amount of your income that's going into savings, you live on
$90,900 a year, so you would be in about the same situation as you
are now _ with a couple of extra elements (which I edited out of
your letter) that would brighten the picture still further. These
are that you expect to save more after financing a child's college
education, and that you plan to do a bit of consulting after you
officially retire. So, as Red Barber used to say, you should be
sitting in the catbird seat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to roll my two investments into mutual fund accounts
with a better return. I do not plan to withdraw any money before
age 65, at which time I would like to have about $5,000 available
in a cash account for special purchases. All of this money is for
special purchases, since our major savings are in my husband's
401(k) account. I was looking at some of the Janus funds but would
like your input on maximizing return.
</P>
<P>
   L.T., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. What you propose is almost precisely the opposite of what
most people would do. Even though you don't anticipate a
predictable sequence of withdrawals, and none at all before three
years, most people just entering retirement are looking for safer
and more conservative investments, not aggressive ones.
</P>
<P>
   You don't specify which of the many TIAA-CREF investment
vehicles you are using, but you should be able to find a solid,
growth-oriented investment there, without rolling over the money at
all. Probably the most aggressive is the TIAA Growth Equity
account, which has built a solid record in about three years.
</P>
<P>
   To take a fairly aggressive course, I would venture no further
than considering the TIAA/CREF Growth and Income account, which is
a little more cautious. The managers consign some assets to
indexing, tracking the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, and actively
manage the remainder. The upshot is a portfolio with both
price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios that represent about 90
percent of those of the S&AMP;P 500. The managers have done a good job,
and the fund has been modestly outperforming the index in recent
years with what is, at least statistically, a more conservative
porrtfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Fidelity Contrafund has an excellent long-term
record, despite modestly trailing the results of the S&AMP;P 500 Index
in recent years. It is classified as a growth fund but is among the
more conservative in its class, partly as a result of its huge
asset base. This is plenty aggressive enough for the portfolio of a
recent retiree. So I would suggest no change there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We just had a child. We currently invest 5 percent of our
earnings in the 401(k) plan, the maximum allowed by the plan. Can
you suggest ways to invest an additional 5 percent of income in
taxable accounts to support retirement and college costs? In
addition to the Index 500 fund, is a mixture of mid-cap, small-cap,
international, and/or technology funds appropriate? I would prefer
Vanguard or Fidelity funds.
</P>
<P>
   B.O., Franklin, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You should be in good shape _ particularly if you adopt a
more aggressive posture toward the money loafing in those money
market accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Since you don't provide an income figure, I can't calculate a
total accumulation that includes your contributions. But you can do
it based on these figures: If you were to move the bulk of the
money market funds to stock investments, you might reasonably
expect average annual growth of 10 percent over the next decade.
With no contributions, the current account would reach $810,141 in
10 years. To that you could add $17,068 for every $1,000 per year
you add during the 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   If you continue to hold nearly half of your savings in the money
markets, a more reasonable expectation would be 8 percent total
portfolio growth, which would take the account to $664,288 after 10
years, to which you could add $15,244 for every $1,000 per year
that you contribute.
</P>
<P>
   I have no problem with your list of prospective investments for
the taxable accounts and would suggest Vanguard's various index
funds over Fidelity's offerings, simply because index funds tend to
be more tax-efficient than actively managed funds. But given the
fact that more than half of your money is already in an Index fund
that tracks the Standard and Poor's 500 Index _ the Barclays
holding in the 401(k) _ I would switch the Index Growth position
for one in Vanguard Health Care fund, a move that would have no
short-term tax implications, since it is an IRA.
</P>
<P>
   I would leave the Index 500 account as it is _ why pay taxes
when you don't have to? _ but would add no more to it, opting
instead for new positions in Vanguard's Mid-Cap, Small-Cap, and
Total International index funds. If you decide later to add a
technology fund, I would look instead to the array of Fidelity
offerings. Picking and choosing among the confusing bevy of
technology stocks is not the sort of thing that lends itself to
Vanguard's disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   As I said at the outset, I would suggest that you move most of
the money market funds into stock accounts, if you are indeed
looking to the long term _ either a college education in 17 or 18
years or your retirement in a decade. I know that may seem
difficult in the current market, and I wouldn't blame you if you
used a dollar-cost-averaging discipline to get this money into the
market. But your investment time frames should allow
more-aggressive investments, and as federal employees you probably
shouldn't have the kind of worries about employment security that
dictate keeping a large financial security blanket in liquid funds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, however you plan to handle the college savings, I have
two suggestions. First, carefully earmark the money so you know
what you have saved for that purpose and what you have saved for
retirement. Second _ and this does not contradict the first
suggestion _ leave the college savings in your own names, thus
increasing your child's potential eligibility for financial aid.

&HT;     COURT REVIVES CHALLENGE TO LAW ON HOTEL CONVERSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A California appeals court has revived a
challenge to San Francisco's hotel conversion ordinance and said
hotel owners shouldn't have to pay the costs of housing the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the 1st District Court of Appeal
reinstated a lawsuit by owners of the San Remo Hotel that claims
San Francisco acted unconstitutionally when it restricted the
conversion of long-term residential hotel rooms to short-term
tourist use and charged the owners $567,000 for a conversion
permit.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 ordinance, under constant legal attack since its
passage, requires hotel owners to get a city permit before renting
former residential rooms to tourists. To get a permit, an owner
must agree to replace the lost residential rooms or pay a fee equal
to 80 percent of the rooms' construction costs, plus site
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   It applies to about 500 hotels with a total of 18,000
residential rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance replaced a somewhat less stringent 1981 measure
that was also intended to preserve residential hotels as a source
of low-cost housing for the poor. But the court said the ordinance
might violate the constitutional ban on confiscating private
property for public use without just compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affordable housing for the indigent may be a worthy goal, but
it is also an expense traditionally and rightly borne by society as
a whole,'' said the opinion by Justice Lawrence Stevens. ``Even
well-intentioned measures may create unconstitutional takings.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Andrew Schwartz disagreed, saying the
ordinance was no different from any other zoning measure that
restricted land use. He also contended it did not differ
substantially from the 1981 version, which was upheld in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for affordable housing is one of the paramount goals
of the government and has been affirmed and reaffirmed by the
voters,'' Schwartz said. ``With the recent dramatic increase in
housing costs, the hotel conversion ordinance is more important
than ever. . . . We feel that it balances the rights of residential
hotel owners against the public's need to preserve the dwindling
supply of affordable housing.''
</P>
<P>
   The court overturned two rulings in the city's favor: Superior
Court Judge Raymond Williamson's dismissal of the hotel owners'
claim that the ordinance is unconstitutional, and Superior Court
Judge William Cahill's dismissal of their challenge to the $567,000
fee they paid in 1996 to continue renting most of their 62 rooms to
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court stopped short of a definitive ruling on either
issue but said the case must be reconsidered in Superior Court
under legal standards more favorable to the owners than those used
by Williamson and Cahill. Schwartz said no decision had been made
on whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court.

SOME ARGUE LIEBERMAN'S SPEECH SAVED CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The summer of 1998 was painful for Senator Joseph
I. Lieberman. News reports suggested he would call on President
Clinton to resign for having an affair with an intern. Or, as
Lieberman suggested, he might call for a Senate censure of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Connecticut Democrat took to the floor on Sept. 3,
1998, he delivered a speech that decried Clinton's ``immoral'' and
``embarrassing'' behavior but made clear he didn't want to remove
or punish the president.
</P>
<P>
   This week, with Lieberman's selection as the vice presidential
candidate, the senator's condemnation of Clinton is being touted as
a major reason Al Gore picked him. But the now-famous Lieberman
speech may have had another effect: It might have saved Clinton's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that because he said what he did, he was speaking
for more than just himself,'' Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle
said Tuesday. While saying that he had no way of knowing how most
senators would have acted, Daschle said, ``A lot of people felt
that by giving that speech, they didn't need to go further than
what he articulated on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's carefully calibrated speech is emblematic of his 12
years as a US senator. He is partial, quite literally, to a
Talmudic form of decision-making, holding his thoughts in private,
weighing all sides, and trying to come to a just decision. The
result frustrates some Senate colleagues, who note that Lieberman,
at times, has seemed to take both sides of issues such as private
school vouchers, affirmative action, and Social Security
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the speech about Clinton was classic Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman had called for the president's ouster, as some
Democrats initially feared, it might have led to a domino effect
among Democrats. Lieberman had known Clinton longer than most other
senators, having enlisted the young Arkansan and fellow Yale
University law school alumnus in 1970 to work in Lieberman's state
Senate campaign. In 1995, Lieberman became chairman of the moderate
Democratic Leadership Council, a post once filled by Clinton.
Moreover, he was known as the ``conscience of the Senate,'' giving
his views extra weight and legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lieberman appeared in the Senate chamber, he informed the
president by telephone about the contents of the speech. The
president did not try to talk Lieberman out of the condemnation.
Instead, some Democratic officials now believe, the president was
convinced Lieberman's speech would save his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He agonized over the speech he gave in September 1998,'' said
Steven Grossman, who was chairman of the Democratic National
Committee at the time. ``Joe is extraordinarily meticulous about
the way he contemplates a decision. It was a very painful,
emotional, draining process he went through. He was about to
criticize the president for standards of behavior. Joe's principles
and values were at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he urged Lieberman to allow the impeachment process
to move forward before coming to any conclusion. That seemed fair
to Lieberman, who said in his speech that it was too early to call
for resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, a longtime friend of Lieberman who served as
Clinton's White House counsel, said the senator's speech was, in
the end, helpful to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him before he made that speech, and I talked to
him after he made the speech,'' Davis said on CNN Tuesday. ``And I
am convinced today that he is in large part responsible for the
ultimate acquittal of President Clinton, because by expressing the
outrage, the moral outrage that he did and giving vent to those
concerns, he was able to credibly make the distinction between the
conduct that was not defensible and the performance in office,
which surely still has a high approval of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis could not be reached for additional comment.
</P>
<P>
   Former federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova, a Republican who
closely followed the impeachment, agreed that Lieberman could have
created an unstoppable movement against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have been the end of the ballgame for the
president,'' diGenova said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when it came time to decide whether to convict
Clinton, Lieberman's ``not guilty'' vote helped pave the way for
other Democrats to do the same. Lieberman suggested that even
criminal activity by the president was not enough to force him out
of office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question before the Senate is whether the president's
wrongdoing . . . was more than reprehensible, more than harmful,
and more than strictly criminal, but actually threatened our
government and the national interest,'' Lieberman said, explaining
his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reflection and review of the evidence, the meaning of
the term high crimes and misdemeanors and, most important, what I
believe to be the best interests of the nation, I have concluded
the facts don't meet the high standard the founders set and cannot
justify removing the president from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, many Republicans praised Lieberman as a moral and
moderate man who agrees with George W. Bush on key issues. But some
Republicans still remember that Lieberman switched sides on the
confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court in 1991. After
initially supporting Thomas, Lieberman changed his mind after
hearing the allegation that Thomas sexually harassed Anita Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wrestled with it all day. I decided that I had too many
doubts and that it was better when you're dealing with the Supreme
Court to err on the side of caution,'' Lieberman said in 1991,
explaining he was undecided until 15 minutes before the Thomas
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to diGenova, some Republicans will wonder why
Lieberman didn't call for a stronger penalty against Clinton
considering that Thomas denied the allegation against him, while
the president acknowledged an affair with intern Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   DiGenova, a Thomas supporter, said he still doesn't know what
Lieberman meant by ``err on the side of caution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of Monica Lewinsky, perhaps Joe would have voted the
other way on Thomas,'' diGenova said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, sounds like one of the senator's admirers.
``I'm very happy about Joe Lieberman,'' Clinton said Monday after
hearing about the vice presidential choice. ``He's been great for
America.''

DOGFIGHT BREWING BETWEEN US REGULATORS, BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With beady eyes, venomous spines, and a habit of biting
chunks out of living whales, the spiny dogfish was, for decades, a
trash fish _ so hated that fishermen routinely poisoned or
dynamited them.
</P>
<P>
   But like a prom queen picked from a crowd of wallflowers, the
3-foot-long shark has undergone a popularity boost in the last
decade, feeding the seemingly bottomless British appetite for fish
and chips.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in yet another sign of how heavily fished the Atlantic has
become, the lowly dogfish is at the center of one of the country's
nastiest water wars. A US District Court judge in Boston has ruled
that fishermen must severely restrict their catches, setting up a
showdown between the federal government and Massachusetts, the
nation's leading dogfishing state.
</P>
<P>
   Federal managers say the dogfish can't reproduce fast enough to
keep up with all the fishing and imposed limits on dogfishing in
all federal waters. Judge William H. Daley two weeks ago rejected
the fishermen's challenge of the rules, clearing the way for a
crackdown that will hit hard in Massachusetts ports such as
Scituate, where dogfish are the top catch.
</P>
<P>
   But fishermen have vowed to appeal and Massachusetts officials
declared that, despite the court case, they plan on bucking the
limits in state waters, which extend to 3 nautical miles, with a
quota that is 11 times higher. In most cases, states closely follow
federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about overfishing too . . . and we understand
this is a highly controversial issue,'' said David Pierce, acting
assistant director for the state Division of Marine Fisheries.
``But we can rebuild and continuously harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, a Massachusetts delegation will meet with other
Atlantic states to hash out how much dogfish should be harvested in
state waters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, dogfish lovers complain of a cascading problem.
First, the seemingly endless supply of cod was exhausted. Then
scallops. Fishermen soon developed markets for so-called ``trash
fish,'' such as monkfish and dogfish, that had grown so plentiful
in part because they had been ignored. Now, even these more obscure
beasts are facing collapse. Next, say ocean specialists, could be
the skate _ a delicacy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many stocks are in bad shape,'' said Anthony Chatwin,
marine scientist at the Conservation Law Foundation, an
environmental advocacy group. According to a federal report issued
last October, New England had at least 16 stocks that were
overfished. ``Fishing stocks have been managed for years without a
vision or a strategic plan,'' said Chatwin.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there never was any plan for dogfish, which used to
illicit only groans from fishermen. Traveling in packs of
thousands, the brown and slate-gray fish would go after precious
cod and herring _ and virtually anything else: worms, lobster, and
even algae. Their name _ along with aliases skittledog, cod shark,
and thorndog _ comes from that voracious and all-encompasing
appetite.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the infamous fish have been bestowed with a
kinder name in an effort to improve its image: Cape shark.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, fishermen began chasing the dogfish as cod became
scarce. Now, roughly 55 percent of the 49 million pounds of dogfish
catches that land in the United States comes from Massachusetts.
There are three processing plants in the state, and in Plymouth,
spiny dogfish account for 96 percent of all fish landings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important industry in Massachusetts and
elsewhere,'' said Harvey Mickelson, attorney for the American
Dogfish Association. The group plans to appeal the federal
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks are at an all-time high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishery experts counter that the number of sexually mature
females has dropped. The gestation period for dogfish is unusually
long _ 22-24 months _ so killing off adult females could cause
serious problems in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fight is far from over, fishermen say they find
themselves in a familiar situation: wondering if there is another
species out there, like the dogfish, that will keep them in
business.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a frizzy-haired and pimply Long Island
fifth-grader, Atoosa Rubenstein would sign autographs for her
friends, adding a simple postscript: R.S.
</P>
<P>
   That would be short for Rock Star, as in, dream on _ which she
did, landing a glamorous job and capturing a mass audience in her
own way.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 28, she's the youngest editor in the Hearst magazine
empire, overseeing CosmoGIRL!, which turned a year old with its
August issue, a milestone that has Rubenstein celebrating. Last
July, when the ``little sister'' to Cosmopolitan magazine was about
to be launched, she told the Globe: ``There's nothing firm planned
for 2000. We have our fingers crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen Black, president of Hearst Magazines, had asked
Rubenstein to develop a prototype of the magazine in 1998 and
within 48 hours of receiving it offered her the job as editor.
Rubenstein was then 26.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But her success as a queen of teens might have been hard to
predict just a decade ago, when, as an Iranian immigrant trying to
blend into suburbia, she took a job selling Fudgie the Whale ice
cream cakes at Carvel to keep her mind off the fact that no one had
asked her to the prom. Worse, she sprouted a cold sore for her
senior picture.
</P>
<P>
   It stands to reason that Rubenstein has built a career based on
this theme: Ugly ducklings can become swans.
</P>
<P>
   She became hooked on fashion magazines in an attempt to learn,
among other things, how to clear her skin. After an internship at
the now-defunct Sassy magazine, she moved to Cosmo after graduating
from Barnard with a degree in political science and in 1998 married
Ari Rubenstein, a commodities trader. She has two cats, Thurston
and Lovey, and a baby: CosmoGIRL! Not to mention an 11th-floor
corner office in midtown Manhattan with an ice-blue iMac and the
credentials that really matter: ``I've been a girl all my life and
I'm a good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   How has the magazine fared? Executives say advertising pages
have jumped 30 percent from the premiere issue and about 500,000
copies are being sold each month, some internationally. The
CosmoGIRL! offices are also relocating into the same building as
Cosmo, a block down Broadway _ an acknowledgement of the magazine's
success at tapping into the $98 billion teen market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most aggressive launches in the history of
Hearst,'' said Donna Kalajian Lagani, publishing director of
Hearst's Cosmopolitan Group. ``God bless the little brat!''
</P>
<P>
   Nina B. Link, president and CEO of the Magazine Publishers of
America, says there's been a rush to capitalize on the demographic.
``We are seeing an influx of teen-oriented titles: CosmoGIRL!,
Entertainment, MH17, Teen People, Girl, etc., and we expect to see
more magazines as teen tastes change,'' Link says.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rubenstein can still recall how it feels to be a
teenager, outside the in crowd, and she shapes the editorial
content of her magazine with those emotions in mind. You can see
her imprint in the monthly editor's notes where she wraps the table
of contents around her own teenage experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize the importance'' of moments like being snubbed on
prom night. ``And we don't downplay it,'' says Rubenstein. ``If
they don't get good advice, it could be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the steel security door into the CosmoGIRL!
office space, a visitor first notices the pervasive, cheery scent
of citrus emanating from the candle burning on Rubenstein's desk.
Smells like teen spirit. It's no surprise, either, that the office
is full of ``youngiepoohs'' (Rubenstein's term) or that only two
men work in the editorial offices and that they, of course, dress
stylishly. Otherwise, the space _ intended only to be temporary _
is bland, with beige walls that could use a little touching up.
Rubenstein's office is spare, too.
</P>
<P>
   But she's all strappy heels, skin-tight gray T-shirt just short
enough that it can't be tucked into her pale blue, snakeskin skirt,
midcalf length, with a slit up the back and girly print underwear
peeking out the waistline near the small of her back. (This last
detail is likely more accident than fashion statement.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she always dresses like this, Rubenstein shoots back:
``Dress like what?''
</P>
<P>
   Her sort of zest is rooted, at least in part, in a tragedy far
more devastating than sitting home on prom night. During her junior
year of high school, Rubenstein's father, Mansour Behnegar, died of
pneumonia. He caught the illness from Atoosa, the youngest of his
four children. Hours after she was released from the hospital, he
died in the same facility. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem real. It felt like he was on holiday,'' she
recalls, gazing out the window. ``I didn't grieve. I was in
shock.'' She breathes deeply and pauses. ``One thing that it's
taught me is to appreciate life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Behnegar family immigrated to New York City when Atoosa was
3, leaving behind a comfortable pension for a new life in a country
that Mansour Behnegar believed rewards achievements.
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult transition. Rubenstein's father, an Air Force
general and mayor in his native country, found work as a cab
driver. There was also a significant cultural gap. Their household
was a strict one and at a time when her friends were staying out
late, Rubenstein was not even allowed to talk to boys, let alone
date them. Her single act of adolescent rebellion, she says, came
when she sneaked from her room to go to McDonald's and was
grounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised by a strong woman, who had very strong values,''
Rubenstein says. ``I never disobeyed my mother except for that one
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother still lives on Long Island with Rubenstein's siser
Elahe, who's 45. Another sister, Anousheh, is a 43-year-old doctor,
and her brother, Nasser, 37, teaches political science at Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that (growing up)was more difficult for her,'' her
brother says. ``I suspect that's probably part of the secret of her
success in the magazine. She actually makes a contact with her
readership, as opposed to being an adult who's merely interested in
high sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning into the crook of a cushy tan sofa in her office,
Rubenstein recalls a supportive family and an isolated adolescence.
Her siblings were well into adulthood when she was a teenager, and
her mother, . . . well, who talks to her mother about boys or sex?
So she turned to magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need is honesty, someone to level with you. I never
had that,'' not even, Rubenstein adds, from the industry stalwart
Seventeen, which was founded in 1944 and sells more than 2 million
copies a month.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein points to her thick hair. The teen magazines, she
says, ``would all say deep condition your hair'' to defrizz. ``It
doesn't work! We'd never say that in our magazine.'' Instead, she
says, you should dry your hair pulled back in a bun.
</P>
<P>
   As for Seventeen, which its spokeswoman describes as ``the
oldest, the biggest, and the best,'' Rubenstein shrugs. It's too
fashion-oriented, she says, bent on showing expensive clothing.
That brings Rubenstein rummaging once again through her closet of
childhood memories. ``I'd see a $400 dress (advertised) and think,
`I'm so poor,' '' she says. ``But I wasn't poor. That was
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein says CosmoGIRL! is a ``masterblend'' of a teen
magazine, and the first to have a money page. The publication is
also known for including sheets of stickers, like the recent one
featuring Ben Affleck, and for having an editor who personally
responds to voluminous e-mails, many of which arrive after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   It also deals with sex in an age-appropriate way. This is not
Cosmo with Clearasil ads. In the August issue, for example, a
16-year-old reader says her boyfriend wants to have sex but she
wants to wait until she's 20. ``You should have your talk,'' the
magazine's Dr. Judy advises, ``way before the kissing gets out of
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick, says Rubenstein, is ``treating a 16-year-old girl as
a person, being real and letting them know we, too, are real.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the August anniversary issue of CosmoGIRL!, Rubenstein kicks
off her Editor's Note with one word: ``Hey!'' And she signs it
``Atoosa,'' written in red pen with a hand-scrawled heart before
the A. In between, frank words:
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about problems I had as a teen and how I got over
them. But there was one problem I didn't kick until this year; I
was terrified (this last word is in hot pink bold letters) of going
anywhere alone. Perfect example? Let's say I was supposed to meet
my friends at a party. I'd be totally frozen (again in hot pink) if
I didn't spot them right away. Inside my head I'd be saying, `Say
hi to someone. Just say hi. SAY HI YOU MORON!' But I was so scared,
I'd rush into the bathroom and wash my hands or study my face until
my friends got there.'' She goes on. ``Why did I feel weird? Let me
count the ways: I was so emotionally connected to music that
sometimes I'd cry...''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein, who was tickled recently when she rediscovered a fan
letter she wrote to Menudo, insists she's not a teen-aged girl
trapped in a woman's body. She just has an outstanding memory of
her youth, of how she felt, what she wore, and even that Saturday
morning American Bandstand program when Madonna uttered those
famous words to Dick Clark that she wanted to ``rule the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a place in my mind,'' she says, ``where I go and
remember.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The week barely had begun and there already were big
problems with the John Ruiz-Evander Holyfield card. Fortunately,
they didn't involve Ruiz or Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   The bout between World Boxing Association welterweight champion
James Page and mandatory No. 1 contender Andrew ``Six Heads'' Lewis
is being billed as the semi-main event on Saturday's Showtime card.
But the way it looks, Six Heads will need six pairs of eyes to find
Page.
</P>
<P>
   According to Page's Washington attorney, Kiyo Oden, the champion
was informed of the fight only five days ago and has no intention
of defending the title Saturday night. Oden said the WBA has
dragged its feet on rescheduling the fight since June 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel one week's notice of a world title fight raises safety
and health issues for James,'' Oden said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to boxing sources, this is all about Page's
threatened move to dump manager Carl King, the son of his promoter,
Don King, in favor of James Prince, the former rap impresario who
has signed Floyd Mayweather and is wooing Roy Jones Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Since he began to quarrel over his managerial contract, Page has
not fought; his last ring appearance was July 24, 1999, and he has
gone through four trainers since his troubles with King began.
</P>

   Page, who is scheduled to earn only $112,500 for this fight, has
not been seen in Las Vegas and is not expected to attend Thursday's
press conference. Don King was in Los Angeles Tuesday publicizing
the Ruiz-Holyfield fight for the vacant WBA title; efforts to reach
him were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Oden fears that the WBA will try to strip Page for failing to
appear Saturday night because the organization and King are
longtime allies. ``James's main concern is the WBA stripping him of
his title,'' Oden said. ``We've had no contact from them since June
27 until I got a voice message from (WBA president) Gilberto
Mendoza on Aug. 3 saying no decision had been made on the fight or
whether there needed to be a new purse bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later that day, they informed us not only that the fight was
on but that it was scheduled for Aug. 12 in Las Vegas and there was
no warranting a new purse bid. How do you make no decision early in
the day and later in the day have a site and a date for the
fight?''
</P>
<P>
   Page (25-3, 19 KOs) is a fearsome puncher, and so is Lewis
(18-0-1, 17 KOs). Lewis has not fought since Dec. 11, 1999, but has
knocked out 12 of his last 13 opponents, which is an obvious reason
why trying to fight him on a week's notice seems unwise.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact the title he is fighting Ruiz for became vacant
only because of boxing's odd politics, three-time world champion
Holyfield said Tuesday he still believes it will be a
record-breaking performance if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't feel it's tainted because I look at what this
game's always been,'' Holyfield said. ``When you don't follow the
rules and regulations, you lose your title. I decided to keep
fighting (after losing to Lennox Lewis) and the guy who was the
best didn't follow the regulations (and defend against Ruiz, his
mandatory challenger, instead opting to make more money fighting
Michael Grant in April). He forfeited his belt. I don't feel
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Ruiz has been training in Las Vegas at the legendary Johnny
Tocco's gym. Although Tocco died several years ago, the gym has
remained an out-of-town home for some of the greatest fighters of
all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz for months has been asked to justify his No. 1 ranking and
shot at the world title, even though no one seems to bring up that
question to Grant, who was destroyed in less than two rounds by
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   On that matter, Ruiz is growing weary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have put myself on the line so many times,'' Ruiz said.
``First of all, I wanted to fight Grant (who was then the WBA's No.
2 contender), and what happens next? He decides to fight Lewis, and
that leaves me out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis is totally avoiding me. What am I supposed to do? I'm
basicaly going by the rules. I was No. 1 in both the WBA and WBC,
which I earned because I came up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel I have a lot to prove. Even to myself. I
know I'm a great fighter and I intend to prove it. There's always
going to be criticism no matter what happens. There's nothing I can
say that will change people's minds.''

COULD THIS SITUATION BECOME UNMANAGEABLE?

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Jimy Williams is two-thirds of the way through
his fourth season managing the Boston Red Sox. If he makes it to
Opening Day 2001, he will have more continuous service on New
England's hot seat than any man since Joe Cronin (1935-47).
</P>
<P>
   Lately, there has been reason to wonder whether Jimy will last
that long. This has been a trying season for the Sox, and the deep
freeze between the manager and general manager Dan Duquette is
enough to cool the World Trade Center. Most recently, Williams got
little support from the front office when he confronted the team's
out-of-control center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   So what about it, Jimy? Will you be back next year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a contract for next year,'' he answered. ``Why would
you ask that?''
</P>
<P>
   I told him. It strikes me that he might not need all this grief.
He's made plenty of dough. Life might be simpler as a coach with
the Braves again. He could be fired (like almost all managers) or
he could quit (like so few).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an opinion, really. Just a question. As the Sox lurch
toward the finish of this goofy 2000 season, Williams has the look
of a man who could decide that he doesn't want to go through this
again. Then again, maybe it's just my imagination. Maybe managing
the Red Sox under Duquette isn't such a bad thing. Maybe the talk
shows and papers aren't driving him nuts. Maybe he thrives in an
environment where the smallest event takes on enormous importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Boston,'' he said. ``I like the way the fans come out
and pull for us. People in that city, they want us to be good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things don't come easy, and I like that. People here,
when we don't win, they point at me. The starters aren't going six
innings and you're not getting the hits you want. Everybody has an
idea, but that's because they want the team to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston is a tough town in which to manage, and this has been a
challenging season (47 players, too many injuries) for any big
league skipper. Williams has been uneasy and downright testy with
some of his postgame nonanswers. But he says he still likes it
here.
</P>
<P>
   How are things with you and Dan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan, he's fine,'' said Jimy. ``Our communication has been
fine. Dan gave me an opportunity to manage and I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he involve you in personnel decisions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I'm asked, yes, a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you know Jeff Frye was going to be traded?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are his answers and he's sticking to 'em. He's not going
to tell you the real story on Frye, Izzy Alcantara (whom he'd like
to banish to Alcatraz), the games he's been forced to manage
shorthanded, his confrontation with the wacko center fielder, or
his relationship with Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy managed only one other big league team, the Blue Jays. In
Toronto, he stood up to loco outfielder George Bell but was not
supported by the front office and eventually lost his job after a
12-24 start in his fourth season. It's hard to believe he'd want to
repeat that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not that bad. Maybe Jimy and Dan are harmonious and
happy with one another. But it looks to me like they're just being
cool and professional as they work through their differences. When
Williams talks about Duquette, I'm reminded of Bill Parcells
talking about Bob Kraft in the final weeks of the 1996 Super Bowl
season.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy will tell you that there's nothing like managing in Boston.
He said he tries to answer his mail and acknowledges he's gotten a
few lineup suggestions. He said he's never listened to talk radio
and rarely looks at a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't sleep because I know I'm missing those
articles,'' he said (good zinger there).
</P>
<P>
   He still refers to his players as ``kids.'' Always, he talks
about winning ``tonight's game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our team,'' he said. ``I love baseball. It's been very
special for me and my family. Baseball owes me nothing. I owe
everything to baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game is the last one in Anaheim, game No. 110, with 52
to play in the fourth year of the James Francis Williams
administration.

TORIES SCOLD BLAIR'S WIFE FOR POLICY STAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In an unusually scathing personal attack, Britain's
Conservative party has accused the wife of Prime Minister Tony
Blair of inappropriately using her position to take a political
stand and branded her a cross between an ambitious Hillary Clinton
and a murder-minded Lady Macbeth.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, described as unprecedented by some commentators,
touched off a vitriolic debate about the proper place of the person
married to Britain's leader, in a nation that gives the spouse of a
prime minister no formal role or title.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication of how the broadside was
playing with the British public, but with next year's general
election hovering, the Tories could be playing with fire. On the
very same day, the Independent newspaper published an internal Tory
party report warning Conservative leader William Hague that his
party is not in step with most Britons' views on marriage and
women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   The brouhaha erupted Monday when Blair's wife, using her
professional name, Cherie Booth, wrote an opinion piece for The
Daily Telegraph newspaper lauding the pending incorporation into
British law of the European Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives opposed to surrendering British sovereignty
in the name of European integration say the new law will usurp the
authority of British judges and lead to a plethora of frivolous
lawsuits, especially by criminals using specious human rights
claims to try to quash their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Booth, a lawyer who specializes in human rights litigation,
praised the new law, suggesting that it ``forms an integral part of
the government's program of constitutional reform, which has the
aim of modernizing Britain to make it a strong and confident
democracy in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on Monday, the Tories unleashed an attack dog in the
person of John Bercow, a parliamentarian who is the party's
spokesman on home affairs. Bercow charged that Booth had broken
``the long-established convention that prime minister's spouses do
not push their own political agendas.'' The Blairs, who were out of
town on an annual vacation trip to Italy, had no immediate
response.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a swipe at the Clinton administration, which is cozy with
Blair's government, Bercow said Booth had a ``bad dose of `Hillary
syndrome' '' and accused her of wanting either to ``direct policy
from behind the throne'' or set herself up to become lord
chancellor, Britain's highest legal authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``She forgets that in Britain we already have a first lady: the
queen,'' Bercow said. ``If the Blairs bothered to look at their
soulmates the Clintons, they would see that American voters are not
impressed by unelected spouses who seek to ram politically correct
prejudices down their throats. People in Britain will not put up
with anyone who thinks they can be an unaccountable cross between
the first lady and Lady Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10 Downing St., Blair's aides were trying Tuesday to figure
out how comparing Booth to Mrs. Clinton, who is much admired by the
Blair administration, amounted to an insult. But given that
Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth is so ambitious that she talks her
husband into murdering the king, there is little doubt what the
Conservatives had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Joseph, a spokeswoman for the prime minister, rejected the
suggestion that Booth had broken an unwritten rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is an experienced, well-respected human rights lawyer, and
occasionally she writes on matters within her area of interest and
expertise,'' Joseph said. ``Besides being married to the prime
minister, she is an independent, working woman.''
</P>
<P>
   At Labor Party headquarters, they were calling the attack on the
prime minister's wife ``despicable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the sort of utterly offensive rubbish that you expect
from the Tories these days,'' said Fraser Kemp, a Labor
parliamentarian.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party spokesman Peter Craske acknowledged that
Bercow's unusually harsh comments, which some have described as
sexist, had drawn a mixed reaction. Still, he said, Bercow was
voicing the views of the party leadership and his comments were
authorized by the party's central office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point behind what he said is valid,'' Craske said. ``In
this country, prime minister's wives don't get involved in
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how such a rule would apply to a prime minister's husband,
especially since the Tory standard bearer remains former prime
minister Margaret Thatcher, Craske replied: ``Right. Prime
minister's spouses. Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Craske said Booth should refrain from voicing any opinions on
public policy until her husband leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday whether Bercow or anyone else in the Tory
leadership had seen the party's internal report on women's issues
before launching the attack on Booth. The Conservative Policy Forum
report, based on surveys of party members, suggested that placing
``too heavy an emphasis on traditional marriage by our party would
be politically unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many groups believe that the party itself should improve its
image for young working women,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It struck some as odd that a party that seeks to attract young
working women would attack the nation's most visible working mom.
Just days before giving birth to her fourth child in May, the
45-year-old Booth went to court to challenge the policy of her
husband's government that denies parental leave to some British
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Allyson Abel, a lawyer from North London who balances work with
looking after her 1-year-old daughter, noted that the Tories had no
complaints when Booth legally challenged her husband's government
in court in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't accept that in her role as a lawyer she can't say
anything or take a position,'' Abel said. ``She was a lawyer before
her husband became prime minister, and she'll be one after he
leaves office.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Abel knows many British women disagree. Her mother-in-law
disapproves of her using her maiden name professionally.
</P>
<P>
   A poll last year found that although British women are getting
ahead in business, with their ranks in executive positions growing
and the gap between them and male managers beginning to narrow,
four out of five working women with families still do all or most
of the housework.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every president wants a doctrine to call his own. But protocol
requires others to confer it. So is there a Clinton Doctrine? I
mean, other than ``Oral Sex Isn't Sex?'' Something on the more
traditional topic of when to use American military power?
</P>
<P>
   According to the president's critics, the Clinton Doctrine is
that American blood and treasure should flow whenever someone in a
faraway land stubs his toe. Clinton gave these critics ammo with
some swaggery ``Never Again'' talk about ethnic cleansing after the
bombing campaign in Kosovo last year. But the Clinton Doctrine is
actually subtler than that.
</P>
<P>
   It addresses what almost everyone agrees is the right question:
With the Cold War over, when should American force be used for
reasons other than our own national security, narrowly defined?
</P>
<P>
   One legitimate answer is: never. But that is isolationism, an
answer that both mainstream parties reject. If you wish to claim
world leadership _ which we do _ you have to be willing to use your
strength for something other than self-protection.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine's answer is that the United States will
sometimes try to stop humanitarian catastrophes and to protect
liberty and democracy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it doesn't sound like much of a doctrine, let alone a subtle
one. But the key words are ``sometimes'' and ``try.'' They directly
contradict the most famous doctrine of recent years, the Powell
Doctrine. Colin Powell's doctrine can be summarized as ``All or
Nothing at All.''
</P>
<P>
   Any military activity should have clear and clearly achievable
goals, should enjoy strong popular support, and should involve
overwhelming force to assure certain and prompt victory. No
quagmires.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with the Powell Doctrine is that if you take it
seriously, it rules out just about any conceivable use of force
except to repel direct threats to America's own safety. It amounts
to virtual isolationism again, via the great circle route.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine says: Why must it be all-or-nothing-at-all?
</P>
<P>
   There are intermediate situations, where our interests and
values are at stake but not our security, which call for an
intermediate response. These situations don't justify half a
million troops and a record-intensity bombing campaign but also
don't justify sitting on our hands. In such situations, a limited
response with a reasonable chance of success need not become a
quagmire, and even partial success can be more honorable than doing
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine does not elevate logical consistency to a
moral precept. Whether we act depends on the circumstances. These
include circumstances we frankly acknowledge, such as geographical
distance or the risk of larger entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   They also include unmentionable circumstances such as the
president's current popularity rating, the nearness of an election,
what else is going on, the mood and strength of the other party,
how many of these things we've tried lately, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in short, very Clintonian. But not wrong for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   Critics make great hay over the inconsistencies. Why Bosnia and
not Rwanda? Why Kosovo and not Sierra Leone? They even suggest
racism. But these complaints generally come when Clinton has acted,
not when he has failed to act. It is a bizarre form of affirmative
action to suggest that we must let white people be slaughtered in
Kosovo because we let black people be slaughtered in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In Somalia, where we did intervene under Bush the Elder, the
critics accused Clinton of turning a humanitarian effort into
something bad called ``nation building.'' Yet when Clinton has
attempted purely humanitarian interventions of his own, with no
larger agenda than saving lives, he stands accused of ``misusing
our troops as social workers.'' The critics seize any opportunity
to interpret an ambiguous result as total failure.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards they apply to Kosovo, French reprisals against
collaborators delegitimize World War II. And, of course, when all
else fails, the critics like to suggest that Clinton's own personal
failings deny him the moral authority to act. In other words,
Bosnians should die for Monica Lewinsky's sins.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't beat a horse with no horse. When would the critics
use American force? The 2000 Republican platform quotes George W.
Bush: ``Let us reject the blinders of isolationism, just as we
refuse the crown of empire. Let us not dominate others with our
power _ or betray them with our indifference'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The platform goes on to call for ``promoting U.S. interests and
principles'' but ``avoiding ... perilous conflicts'' with a ``new
strategy'' reflecting ``a distinctly American internationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, they have no idea. ``Neither this nor that'' is a
hoary rhetorical device (``negotiate out of fear ... fear to
negotiate''), and not a bad principle of governing. But
``insufficiently neither this nor that'' is not much of a critique.
Nor is promising to be ``more neither this nor that'' much of a
guide to your future actions.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP platform complains about ``a chorus of empty threats ...
in the Balkans,'' but doesn't say whether the threats should have
been backed up by action or should not have been made. It says
carefully that ``Americans are troubled by the humanitarian
catastrophes that have plagued the people of Africa,'' but even
more carefully doesn't say what America should do about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have a strategy,'' the platform declares, and
gives plenty of examples of what it isn't but never says what it
is. Tendentious hindsight is not a strategy. The kindest
interpretation of the Republican position is: Sometimes we will act
and sometimes we won't; it all depends on the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Clinton Doctrine is now our bipartisan
foreign policy.

EATON PUTS HIS NOSE TO THE GRINDSTONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Understand this: Chad Eaton is a nice man.
He'd be someone you'd like, regardless of whether he was a football
player. He'd be someone you'd want to have a soft drink and a pizza
with. He's got charisma and pizzazz. No wonder every media outlet
in New England wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   And Eaton was more than accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   That's why his current silence is the ultimate sacrifice for the
Patriots nose tackle, a sign of devotion to his full-time job,
football. He no longer engages in media interviews or idle
chitchat. He doesn't rehearse funny lines to throw out for sound
bites. He doesn't even talk that much to his own teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, 28, didn't have the best of years in 1999, but it wasn't
as bad as some have portrayed it. The coaching staff was concerned
that Eaton was devoting too much time to talk shows. He would
appear on WEEI's ``Dennis and Callahan'' show every Monday, even in
the worst of times when the callers were irate. He also went on
WNRB's Patriots show on Mondays. He'd often do postgame interviews
with flagship station WBCN, or just about anyone else who asked.
Then he'd show up on a late-night Sunday sports show.
</P>
<P>
   It was all Chad, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But now he is dealing with it differently, staying away from
interviews. Occasionally he will be quoted in Sports Illustrated or
on ESPN.com, but his reasoning is that those are special
circumstances, media people he doesn't deal with every day. It's
not that Eaton has turned his back on the media _ which created his
character to begin with _ but he wants to be taken seriously as a
football player.
</P>
<P>
   It was a realization he came to on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chad just realized that it was an issue, something
that was affecting him,'' said linebacker Ted Johnson. ``I don't
know the whole story. Chad . . . loves life. He feeds off
everything. He gets energy off things that happen. He's a fun guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just realized that he needed to take it a little more
seriously. From what I've seen, he's done real well. He's doing his
job out there and not saying much off the field, and that's more
advantageous for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Eaton came out of nowhere, a practice squad guy
discovered by Bill Belichick in Cleveland in 1995, then nurtured by
Pete Carroll to the point where he became a very good player. But
with that came more attention on the field. He often was
double-teamed. This was new to him, and sometimes confusing. In
some games, it seemed he didn't show up, but in just as many he did
a lot of little things that wouldn't show up in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton was used to feeding off Johnson. Both played in the middle
of the field and were responsible for shutting down the run. But
Johnson missed the first 11 games last season, and that seemed to
affect Eaton adversely.
</P>
<P>
   With Belichick running the Patriots, Eaton is trying to be at
his best again, and if that means having tunnel vision when it
comes to the media and personal appearances, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot who has known him the longest, Drew Bledsoe, a
former teammate at Washington State, thinks Eaton is willing to do
whatever it takes to be the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just seen the progress over the years, and it's
amazing,'' said Bledsoe. ``I've seen him mature as a player and as
a person. He's a terrific player who can be very disruptive in the
backfield. I think Chad just needed to get himself going again and
get to the next level. That's what he's doing right now. He's a
winner and he's doing everything he can to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I wouldn't have to speak to the media, either,'' said
Bledsoe, half-kiddingly.
</P>
<P>
   When Eaton arrived in New England, he had blue hair and tattoos
and didn't mind explaining them. Now he's had most of his body art
removed, and his hair is cropped short and back to its natural
color. He's a husband and a father, and has endured some personal
tragedy with the death of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He also is in shape like never before, an indication of his
seriousness. In the first two exhibition games, Eaton was
disruptive on the line and in the backfield. That's what Belichick
challenged him to do. After watching films, the coach basically
asked Eaton what he wanted to be _ a dominating player or a ``JAG''
(just another guy)? It's obvious which path Eaton has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad can be very good,'' said Johnson. ``Athletically, he's
very gifted. He's a rocket man. He's strong. He's chiseled. You
never see Chad dominated. He might have a bad play here and there,
but he's never overmatched. And now, he's lost weight, he's
stronger, quicker. I'm excited for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Free agent defensive lineman Reggie Grimes from Alabama has had
a ball playing alongside Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very, very intense,'' said Grimes. ``He's taught me a
lot. He'll tell me where I should be and what I should be doing.
He's very knowledgeable about the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Even center Damien Woody, who has battled Eaton in training camp
and practice the past two years, sees more intensity. Woody gets
quite a workout day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   In past seasons, Eaton likely would be trash-talking about what
he does to Woody on a daily basis. But that was the old Chad. This
is the new one. He may not be as fun, but every once in a while you
have to reinvent yourself. The Patriots believe that this is a new
and improved Chad Eaton.

IN EUROPE, RYDER HOPEFULS TEE OFF ON EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WISHAW, England _ After the Europeans collapsed last September
at The Country Club, allowing the Americans to claim the greatest
comeback victory in the history of the Ryder Cup, they consoled
themselves on the long flight back across the Atlantic by noting
the differences between them and their hillbilly hosts in
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were golf Philistines. American fans made a
mockery of the etiquette so treasured by golf traditionalists,
mercilessly heckling Europe's Colin Montgomerie, calling the pudgy
Scotsman ``Mrs. Doubtfire.'' They cheered every good shot by an
American and every dubbed shot by a European with a jingoism that
bordered on xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, going beyond the beyonds, as Sean O'Casey might
have put it, the American team and their wives danced on the 17th
green after Justin Leonard improbably holed a 45-foot putt,
oblivious to the fact that Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal still had a
chance to halve the hole. His line walked on, his concentration
destroyed, Ollie left his desperation putt well short.
</P>
<P>
   We'd never do that, the Europeans said.
</P>
<P>
   We have too much class for that, the Europeans said.
</P>
<P>
   We're sportsmen, the Europeans said.
</P>
<P>
   We respect the etiquette of the game, the Europeans said.
</P>
<P>
   And they swore vengeance, saying things would be different in
September 2001 here at The Belfry.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so far, things are indeed different. Almost one year after
the debacle at The Country Club, and one year before the Ryder Cup
is staged here, the Europeans are at war _ not with the Americans,
but with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Never has the European team been so fragmented and riven by
personality clashes, hurt feelings, and grievances, real or
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Peter Gammons's famous description of an
infamously self-centered Red Sox team, the 2001 European Ryder Cup
team could turn out to be 12 guys, 12 cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the European feud has claimed a victim. Mark James, the
European captain at The Country Club, was forced to resign last
week as the 2001 vice-captain after several continental players,
and even England's Nick Faldo, questioned his temperament and
integrity. Sam Torrance, the Scotsman who is the current European
captain, tried to save his friend, James. But the European Ryder
Cup committee wanted to end what had become an embarrassing soap
opera, precipitated by James's tell-all book ``Into the Bear Pit,''
an account of the golf war at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The continentals, especially Olazabal and France's Jean Van de
Velde, who stewed at Brookline when James refused to play him in
the early matches, complain that the British in general and the
English in particular have too much control of the European team.
The continental players resent that the leadership of the 2001 team
is entirely British. Ian Woosnam, a Welshman, survives James as
Torrance's other vice-captain.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal recently threatened to leave the European tour and
compete exclusively on the American tour. Olazabal claims the
European tour is British-oriented. He said the British players get
preferential treatment, alleging that too many photos of
Montgomerie, Europe's No. 1 player for most of the last decade,
adorn the European tour programs, at the expense of continental
players.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal's complaints, which are shared by many other
continentals who are more reticent about airing them, have to be
taken seriously, if only because he and his countrymen, Sergio
Garcia and Miguel Angel Jiminez, may make up such a big chunk of
the next European Ryder Cup team _ unless Olazabal decides to
follow through on his threat and bolt for the American tour.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James's fate was sealed by his book, which is mostly an account
trashing the trash-talking Americans, and a spirited defense of his
own strategy, which many more objective observers have blamed for
the Europeans' collapse on the final day of singles matches at The
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, James questions the moral integrity of Tom Lehman
and mocks Faldo, who had been a member of the previous 11 Ryder Cup
teams, as a preening has-been. In the most controversial passage,
James claims that when Faldo sent a letter wishing the European
team good luck in Brookline, James rolled the letter up in a ball
and tossed it into a wastebasket in front of the players.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great story, but, it turns out, slightly apocryphal.
While Lee Westwood, England's best golfer, suggested the letter
belonged ``in the bin,'' Van de Velde said the rest of the team did
not witness the incident, as James claims in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo accused James of fabricating the story. Even after James
was forced to resign, Faldo vowed to press on with his campaign to
expose James as a liar. But then European PGA officials warned
Faldo against throwing stones, as he was not without sin himself,
having made some unsupportable accusations against officials and
fellow players over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, a chastened Faldo declared his feud with James
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone on too long,'' said Faldo. ``It's time to bring
the matter to a close. Golf is all bigger than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether golf is as big as the egos involved, however, is another
question.
</P>
<P>
   James, who refused to use one of his two captain's picks to put
Faldo on the 1999 team, is one of the few people who could rally
sympathy for Faldo, seen by many of his peers as a self-absorbed
loner. But if Faldo is egotistical, James is considered by some
European players, and more than a few Americans, to be a
condescending jerk.
</P>
<P>
   It was telling that the only vocal support James got after his
dismissal came from fellow Britons: Westwood and Darren Clarke, the
cigar-smoking big hitter from Northern Ireland who beat Tiger Woods
in match play earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who shares Woods's coach, Butch Harmon, said James did a
good job at The Country Club, and noted that the European tour's
tournament committee, which represents players, voted unanimously
to back James. Clarke made it clear that he considers Faldo the
real villain in this tawdry affair, though he despises Faldo so
much he would not use his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``A certain person took great offense to the book, even though
he spends most of his time in America, and decided Mark shouldn't
have anything to do with the Ryder Cup,'' said Clarke, voicing the
sense of betrayal many European players feel when their peers leave
the European tour for the US tour, and underscoring why Olazabal's
threat to do so is so sensitive here.
</P>
<P>
   Woosnam diplomatically declined comment while Montgomerie was
conspicuously ambivalent about backing James, though clearly
relieved that James got the boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attention must focus on looking forward to The Belfry in
2001,'' said Montgomerie, who was as vocal as James about loutish
American behavior at The Country Club and has had his own running
feud with Faldo for years.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, Van de Velde, and other continentals among likely
members of the 2001 team were reported to be pleased by James's
sacking.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Huggert, who was captain of the 1977 Ryder Cup team that
played at Royal Lytham and included both Faldo and James, was also
relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Mark very much and I don't think that when he wrote the
book he knew the trouble it would cause,'' said Huggert. ``But in
my opinion he was never a good choice as vice-captain after
captaining the team in 1999 when there was all that trouble. To
have Mark inside the ropes at The Belfry in quite an important
position would have caused a lot of friction.''
</P>
<P>
   European sportswriters, even some notoriously jingoistic
Englishmen, were overwhelmingly in favor of James getting the boot,
saying his defensive, tell-all book showed poor judgment at best
and, at worst, was evidence that he had used his position as
captain to enrich himself.
</P>
<P>
   While some Britons stood up for James, many others welcomed his
dismissal. Mark Reed, the affable head teaching pro here at The
Belfry, was so busy giving lessons last week that he didn't know
James had been sacked. When informed by the Globe of James's forced
resignation, Reed said, ``Good. Now we can get back to the game,
which is what it's supposed to be all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed spoke for many golfers, pros and hackers alike, who were
appalled by the Ryder Cup becoming a sideshow for petty personal
disputes and score-settling. The Ryder Cup is taken far more
seriously in Europe _ and especially in Britain and Ireland _ than
it is in the United States. For Europeans who complain about
American domination in sports, politics, and business, winning the
Ryder Cup takes on a dimension far larger than a simple golf
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many European fans believe there is enough time for their team
to put aside the last few months of dissension and be ready when
the Americans descend on The Belfry next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special place, because it's hosted three of the last
eight Ryder Cups, and three of the last four played in Europe,''
said Colin Johnston, from nearby Telford, as he contemplated what
club to use at the par-3, 190-yard 14th hole, where Faldo's
hole-in-one helped him halve his match with Paul Azinger in 1993,
when the Americans won here. ``I think by the time the matches
begin here next year, everyone will have forgotten about this. I
know I will.''
</P>
<P>
   The championship Brabazon course here gobbles up mis-hits. Water
guards approach shots at seven of the holes, and small brooks lie
in wait in the middle of several fairways. This great track rewards
shrewd course management far more than sheer power. It is the
course and the game, the history of both, and the Ryder Cup that so
many Europeans are hoping will assert itself in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the middle of the fairway of the 473-yard 18th hole,
near the spot where Christy O'Connor Jr. hit a flawless 2-iron to
beat Fred Couples and help the Europeans secure the Ryder Cup in
1989, Sean Maguire said he hoped the dissension would be
overshadowed by the history of The Belfry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' said Maguire, an Irishman living in London,
pointing to the plaque embedded in the fairway, commemorating
O'Connor and the 2-iron heard all over Europe. ``This is what it's
about. Not someone selling books. Not someone trying to score
personal points over a rival. This is about golf.''
</P>
<P>
   After the European collapse at The Country Club, James quit as
captain of the Ryder Cup team, saying he wanted to concentrate on
making the 2001 team as a player. Faldo, meanwhile, is rejuvenated,
playing his best golf in years, and hopes to make the team, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mustering a smile after a difficult few months, Torrance last
week said he looked forward to playing Faldo and James together in
the foursomes at The Belfry next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo and Mark James, standing next to each other on the
first tee of the Brabazon, with blunt instruments in their hands?
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, that is something to look forward to.

   MEXICO-ABORTION _ MEXICO CITY _ Women have erupted into protest
over a new anti-abortion law in Mexican President-elect Vicente
Fox's home state of Guanajuato. Last week, that state's local
congress suddenly passed by one vote a new provision of the
criminal code that makes abortion illegal even in the case of rape.
The vote provoked a crisis in Fox's party, the conservative
National Action, the PAN, which, along with Fox, has portrayed
itself as more middle-of-the-road of late. The PAN's national
leadership was angered by the vote _ some openly denounced it _ and
Fox distanced himself from the action by saying he had no intention
of pursuing such a ban. Opponents say the current PAN governor of
Guanajuato has an option to veto the law, which he might do, or
other legislators will put up a fight to have it struck down.
Abortion is illegal in Mexico, but in all states it can be sought
in the case of rape. Just as Fox is preparing to take office Dec.
1, the PAN has been damaged. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   BAT-PROJECT _ SAN LUIS VALLEY, Colo. _ When San Luis Valley
residents wake up each morning, there are 2 tons fewer bugs outside
than there were the night before. Tons of bugs disappear each
night, especially in summer, not that the farmers mind. They're
glad, and so is everyone else. And the fact that they have bats to
thank for the insect eradication doesn't seem to bother anyone.
Bats, it turns out, aren't the bloodthirsty villains often
portrayed in books and movies. They're vital to many Colorado
ecosystems and, in the case of the San Luis Valley, vital to the
economy because of crops saved from insects. And bats are being
unintentionally exterminated. Throughout the United States,
destruction of bat habitat is driving them into abandoned mines. In
the last 20 years, mines have been closed to ensure public safety,
but with little thought to the bats possibly living inside. (Grand

   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ The transition was swift, so fast that the
new company name still is only printed on paper and pasted on the
lobby doors, covering the old logo, etched into the plate glass.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregory L. Summe, the new chief executive of the company
that now calls itself PerkinElmer Inc., seems in a hurry to
obliterate much of the past connected with the old name of EG&AMP;G
Inc. In less than two years, he has radically reshaped a one-time
electronics icon into a contender in a quite different field,
dumping its biggest division.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround remains a work in progress. But already it has
lifted the company's once slumbering stock to new heights. Since
being named chairman and chief executive in April 1999, Summe, 43,
has tried to raise investor interest by building on existing assets
and products.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, PerkinElmer is betting on a strategy that
positions it as a player in a field many believe could be the
world's next big economic engine, biotechnology and genomic
research.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble could qualify the firm as ``a case study in corporate
transformation,'' says life sciences consultant Marc Hennebert of
Arthur D. Little Inc. in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   EG&AMP;G, founded in 1947 by Massachusetts Institute of Technology
professor Harold E. Edgerton and two former students, has long
boasted an eclectic product mix, beginning with high-speed flash
lighting for photography, which Edgerton invented.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the company catalog grew to include scanners for
supermarket checkout counters, explosives-detection equipment for
airports, high-vacuum pumps and valves used in machines that make
computer chips, scientific instruments for research, and literally
hundreds more. Bernard O'Keefe _ the longtime chief executive, who
died in 1989 _ once said he couldn't keep track of them all in his
head.
</P>
<P>
   But EG&AMP;G also had a dark side. For much of its life, the bulk of
the company's revenues came from managing major parts of the US
government's nuclear weapons program, beginning with atomic bomb
tests on the South Pacific atolls of Bikini and Eniwetok in 1947
and 1948. Even earlier, O'Keefe was responsible for wiring the
trigger for the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Although EG&AMP;G dropped its nuclear management work, beginning in
1994, the Technical Services division remained the largest
operating unit, even though it returned the slimmest profit. As a
result, stock performance was lackluster for years, and Wall Street
commentator Ron Dorfman put EG&AMP;G on his list of ``do-nothing''
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been languishing in the swamps,'' said John Keane,
founder and chief executive of Keane Inc., a Boston high-tech
consulting firm and an EG&AMP;G director.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, EG&AMP;G's board took action, hiring Summe as
president and putting him in line to succeed John M. Kucharski,
then 61, who was making plans to retire as chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Summe says his task was to find product lines among existing
holdings that could be developed into businesses with the potential
to be marketplace pacesetters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My charter from the board was to make EG&AMP;G a successful
commercial enterprise,'' he said during an interview in his office,
which lacked the usual corner-office decor of framed photos and
certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Summe, who runs and skis to keep fit, still speaks with traces
of his Kentucky boyhood. He holds a master's degree in electrical
engineering, but says he was bitten by the business bug at age 12,
thinking he might take over his father's electrical contracting
business. After college he worked in Texas designing semiconductor
chips, taking night business courses before heading to the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School for a master's degree
in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, he was a McKinsey &AMP; Co. consultant, followed by
five years moving through the executive ranks at AlliedSignal Corp.
His last job there, before a headhunter's call led him to EG&AMP;G, was
running its automotive products group.
</P>
<P>
   The transition following his arrival was wrenching. Kucharski, a
27-year EG&AMP;G veteran who had been chairman since 1987, summed it up
this way: ``Transitions are difficult. You never know how much so
until you get into one.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of EG&AMP;G executives retired, were reassigned, or left. The
total work force was cut 10 percent, to about 12,000, about 1,000
of them now in Massachusetts. Corporate staff was cut in half, and
the executive suite was trimmed from 15 people to 10, nine of them
new to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those nine, including chief financial officer Robert
Friel, came from AlliedSignal, as Summe began reorganizing and
regrouping the 31 individual operating units EG&AMP;G had built up over
five decades of technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Several units were sold, including Technical Services, which
handled the government work and was EG&AMP;G's cash cow for more than
30 years. As recently as 1992, the unit brought in about 70 percent
of EG&AMP;G's revenues. Even after dropping its nuclear facilities
management work, it still accounted for 59 percent of the company's
$927 million in sales in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost-plus contracts under which Technical Services did
its work delivered thin margins, hurting stock performance. Summe
believed that this reliance had created a complacency that thwarted
commercial product development.
</P>
<P>
   EG&AMP;G's culture ``had really been driven by what was successful
in the government contracting world,'' he said. ``You can't have
the same kind of financial ambitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane agreed, describing the company's atmosphere as ``very
genteel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a far cry from the world of cyberspace, high
technology generally, where you are crunching time, always trying
to reduce costs, trying to leap out and stay ahead of your
competitors,'' he said. ``It was not the type of ball game a lot of
the newer directors came to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the first operating units to catch Summe's eye in early
1999 were two in Europe, Berthold GmbH, in Germany, and Wallac Oy,
in Finland, which Kucharski had acquired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Both made scientific instruments for biotechnology and genomics
research laboratories. Hennebert, at Arthur D. Little, estimates
that spending in this marketplace runs about $5 billion a year and
will grow about 15 percent annually for at least two more years.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Perkin-Elmer Corp. _ an old-line,
Norwalk, Conn., maker of precision scientific instruments _ was
putting its manufacturing operations up for sale, as it moved into
direct genomic research. Renamed PE Biosystems Corp., the company
had taken genomics researcher J. Craig Venter's Celera Corp. under
its wing and joined the race to map the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Perkin-Elmer's scientific hardware unit was a nice match to
those of Berthold and Wallac, and in March 1999 Summe agreed to buy
these operations for $250 million cash, plus assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Perkin-Elmer name was part of the deal. That July Summe
announced EG&AMP;G would be renamed PerkinElmer.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the company's Technical Services unit was sold for
$250 million to the Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C., investment
group. The EG&AMP;G name went with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing the name was very controversial at the time,'' Summe
said. But keeping it, he said, would endorse the status quo. A new
brand, built on a name scientists knew, ``changed us culturally.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Kent Hansen, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology
professor of nuclear engineering and senior member of the
PerkinElmer board of directors, said: ``Changing the name was a way
to sever our connection with government contracting. One has to
give Greg credit for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Two more moves further solidified the company's position in
genomics. One was an $8 million investment in Genomic Solutions
Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich., which is also involved in genome mapping
and went public in May.
</P>
<P>
   The other was PerkinElmer's June announcement of a deal to
acquire NEN Life Sciences Inc. in Boston's South End, which makes
and sells radioactive isotopes for medical use and research. The
price: $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   NEN already made nonradioactive luminescent research reagents
for laboratory use, a field in which Wallac also is active. It
already had plans to expand into genomics research, and later this
year will begin selling glass microscope slides carrying samples of
human genomic material for research laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Summe expects NEN Life Sciences to post $125 million in sales
this year, up from $108 million in 1999, pushing total revenues for
PerkinElmer's life sciences unit to nearly $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   There's activity at other PerkinElmer divisions, too, led by a
unit that has helped set the pace in developing machines to detect
explosives in airport luggage and cargo. Just before changing its
corporate name last fall, EG&AMP;G bought one of its biggest
competitors in the business, Vivid Technologies Inc. of Woburn, for
$62.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other growth opportunities the company cites are in strobe
lighting for the entertainment industry, fiber-optic devices, and
flat digital display panels made from an EG&AMP;G-invented substance
called amorphous silicon. Panels for reading X-rays without film
are now on the market; the images can be stored in digital files
and transmitted to doctors and hospitals around the world. Summe
also foresees applications in luggage and cargo inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are bullish about these prospects. The
company ``is more than a turnaround now,'' said Paul Knight of
Thomas Weisel Partners in New York. ``They are morphing from a
conglomerate to a growth stock.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects PerkinElmer shares, which hit a closing high of
$76.25 in March and closed at $65.5625, up 43.75 cents, on Friday,
to reach $95 during the first half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   James Samuels, a Banc of America Securities analyst, applauds
the focus on life sciences. ``I don't know if Greg scours the
scientific journals or what, but anything that's interesting, that
seems to have any promise, they're doing it.'' Samuels has set a
target share price of $75 by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Summe says that more acquisitions and divestitures are likely.
``We'd rather be in fewer businesses, but in really strong
competitive positions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edgerton and his founding partners, Kenneth Germeshausen and
Herbert Grier, are dead, but those who knew them say they'd like
what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc,'' as Edgerton was known, ``thought change was
wonderful,'' Hansen said. ``Everything that opened broader horizons
and brought new ways of seeing things _ Doc would be all for it.''

ANARCHISTS VOW TO HOLD PEACEFUL GATHERING IN LA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two in T-shirts, two in ties, one in a sleeveless
blouse, the anarchists prepared to call the session to order
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, they had to lay down the law: cell phones off, no
questions out of turn, stick to the subject. Oh, and don't forget
the sign-in sheet.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the speakers, a teenager using the pseudonym Panda,
explained before politely stepping to the side, ``If people are
afraid of anarchy, it's only because they don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   But their news conference, complete with a podium and plenty of
TV cameras, provided no better understanding of what the group
would do during the Democratic National Convention next week.
Instead, the speakers, on summer break from college, swore only
that their own gathering, the North American Anarchist Conference,
which starts Friday, would be peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   For three days, hundreds, maybe even a thousand, anarchists from
across America and Canada are to meet in Los Angeles. The topics to
be discussed _ education, poverty, human rights _ would sound
mundane were it not for some catchy titles such as ``Mutant
Becomings'' and ``Racist Mascots.'' Also on the calendar:
``Pacifism as a Pathology.''
</P>
<P>
   The agenda has city leaders and police concerned, since more
than a few of the anarchist attendees are expected to stick around
for the big convention. Another anarchist group, known as the Black
Cross Collective, took credit for much of the property damage
caused last year in downtown Seattle by young people protesting
World Trade Organization meetings. And the Web site of at least one
anarchist organization is encouraging its brethren to arrive ready
to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   But the August Collective, as the dozen or so hosts of the
upcoming conference call themselves, insisted they would have none
of that, at least not inside the as-yet unidentified location where
they will convene. These anarchists, well-mannered and well-spoken,
said they have even gone so far as to ask attendees to refrain from
discussing specific strategies to be used during the Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conference is legal and legitimate, and any police
repression will be purely because of our political beliefs,'' said
Anne Kelly, a physics student.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she added, ``No one has anything to fear from us.''
</P>
<P>
   But by ``us,'' the five members of the August Collective who
spoke at the news conference at Patriotic Hall appeared to mean
only their conference. After stressing that local police and
politicians have misrepresented the movement's beliefs and
practices, 21-year-old Jeff Hendricks backpedaled a bit. ``It's not
our position to tell other anarchists what to do,'' said Hendricks,
who is studying to be a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Said Brendan Crill, 27, who is working toward his PhD in
physics: ``I've been so busy with our conference, I haven't even
thought about what I'll do during the DNC. But it is a big
opportunity, with the spotlight on LA.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep anarchists out of that spotlight, Crill and the others
said, Los Angeles police and federal law enforcement officials have
been monitoring their activities and harassing them at times.
Still, they said, they intend to spread their message.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the group defined anarchy as a ``minimization of
hierarchy and authority over our lives'' and a ``maximization of
personal freedom.'' But there is no official dogma in the growing
anarchist community. Some anarchists, for example, do not consider
property damage to be a form of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anarchy is a very rich political theory. People don't just do
these things without thinking about them,'' Kelly explained to the
crowd, which was largely unfamiliar with the movement until masked
young people hit Seattle's streets.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the August Collective, however, would not say what
they thought of the potential for trouble during the Democratic
National Convention. But they don't want to be made scapegoats for
anarchists or other protesters, either. That's why they went door
to door to talk with business owners in the area where they will
gather.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the group promised no protests during the anarchist
conference.

TWO TITANS OF INDUSTRY RIDE A WAVE OF GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brand new companies, especially technology companies, get
investors' juices flowing because they promise fast growth. They
double and triple their sales quarter by quarter, albeit from tiny
bases.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, start-ups don't have a monopoly on explosive
growth. Sometimes big established companies can blow the doors off
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent examples came from a pair of America's corporate
giants, General Electric and Merck.
</P>
<P>
   At GE, the stellar performance was turned in by GE Power
Systems, a division of the company that has been turning out
turbines for the utility industry practically forever. You can't
get much more old economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the second quarter, Power Systems turned in numbers that
would make any new economy company jealous. Sales rose 60 percent
to $3.74 billion and profits rose 45 percent to $752 million.
Orders rose 80 percent to $5 billion. Just to be clear, that is
billion with a ``b.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent GE is benefiting from being in the right place at
the right time. The nation's utilities went years without ordering
new generating capacity. Now, short of power _ witness this
summer's near blackouts in California _ they have opened up their
wallets and started buying.
</P>
<P>
   But GE is more than lucky. ``They have picked up market share
and they have come up with new and better products,'' said William
Fiala, an analyst with Edward Jones. According to one report, GE
won 65 percent of the orders for heavy duty gas turbines in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In typical GE fashion, Power Systems also has figured out how to
boost revenue by selling more services to utility customers.
Analysts say the current boom should last at least a few more years
with orders coming from both American and foreign customers.
</P>
<P>
   Power Systems, now GE's biggest industrial business, has done
well enough to make its boss, Robert Nardelli, one of the three
candidates vying to succeed chief executive Jack Welch.
</P>
<P>
   At Merck, the star is a new drug called Vioxx. Vioxx is one of a
new class of painkillers that reduce inflammation without causing
the stomach problems associated with aspirin. Celebrex, a
competitor drug, works similarly. Vioxx has been approved to treat
symptoms of osteoarthritis, menstrual pain, and acute pain.
</P>
<P>
   Merck introduced Vioxx in May 1999. The drug had sales of $97
million in last year's second quarter. Sales rose to $111 million
in the third quarter, $265 million in the fourth quarter, $370
million in the first quarter of 2000 and $475 million in the most
recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has already been approved for use in 70 countries.
``When Merck gets a blockbuster in their system they know what to
do with it,'' said William Sahlman, a professor at the Harvard
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Vioxx still has plenty of room to grow. According
to Rob Petrie of MFS Investment Management, the drug is still being
rolled out in more countries and is likely to be approved for more
conditions. ``If this is a nine-inning game we are probably only in
the second or third inning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine the backflips Wall Street would be doing if a
new company _ a biotechnology company _ came out with a new product
that ramped up this fast?
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, if Vioxx were an independent biotechnology
company its sales would be greater than all but one company in the
industry, Amgen. Genentech, currently the nation's number two
biotech firm, had lower sales than Vioxx in the second quarter yet
still boasts a market value of $44 billion. And Genentech loses
money.
</P>
<P>
   The point here is not to say that General Electric and Merck are
unappreciated or undervalued. ``Both these companies have rich
valuations,'' said Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer at
FleetBoston Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Rather it is that we need to be careful when we make sweeping
judgments about giants and start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old companies in trouble are those that don't embrace
change or add real value,'' said Sahlman. ``What we need are enough
big companies to thrive to offset the ones that get massacred. In
the meantime little ones will grow and displace the big, bad ones.
That has always been so.''
</P>
<P>
   For investors the lesson is simple: Not everything worth owning
is turned out by three guys in a garage. In fact, sometimes the new
new thing comes in a very old package.

IN FLORIDA, A FEAR OF A BACKLASH TEMPERS GLEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The seniors at Sunrise Lakes
Condominiums, a massive, sprawling development of dirt-colored
stucco apartment buildings near Fort Lauderdale, are watching
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman very closely indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Some see great cause for celebration in the fact that Vice
President Al Gore chose Lieberman as his running mate, making him
the first-ever Jewish candidate for the vice presidency. But they
know how things are, so they're worried, too. Stop by one of the
pools at the retirement community, where most of the residents are
Jewish, and free with their opinions, and you will find an optimism
that is decidedly guarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very good,'' said Cathy Bulavram. ``So do I,''
said Jack Bulavram. ``But!''
</P>
<P>
   ``But!'' repeated Jack's 48-year-old son, William.
</P>
<P>
   Those buts are rich with years of history and experience for the
Bulavrams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish him luck, 'cause I like the idea,'' said Jack Bulavram,
``but there are so many anti-Jewish people around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel a lot stronger against Jews, but they won't talk
about it,'' said William Bulavram.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the swimsuit-clad residents of Sunrise Lakes had watched
the talk shows and read the papers Tuesday morning. They'd heard
the pundits say Lieberman's early stand against President Clinton's
behavior with intern Monica Lewinsky could inoculate Gore against
criticism that links him to Clinton's character flaws. And they
agreed, mostly, with what they heard.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman certainly had their votes. But then again, most of
these retirees would have gone with Gore anyway, they said.
Lieberman simply makes them that much more certain to turn out on
Election Day, and more likely to get more involved in the campaign
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish voters make up 6 percent of Florida's voters, according
to local pollster Jim Kane. Whether the Senator from Connecticut
makes any difference to the rest of the state's voters was the big
question by the pool Tuesday, as it was elsewhere in this crucial
Southern state. The seniors wondered whether Lieberman's religion
would turn off non-Jews and whether he would be a victim of
anti-Semitism. Analysts wondered whether Gore's candidacy could be
helped anywhere in the South by his choice of running mate, but
agreed that if Lieberman could help the vice president's chances in
any southern state, it might be Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The contest in this state is far closer than it is elsewhere in
the South, according to recent polls. Those polls show Gore
trailing Texas Gov. George W. Bush badly in the rest of the South,
but by only single digits here. Florida is far more urban and
diverse than other Southern states, and voters are almost evenly
split between the two major parties. Indeed, many locals will say
the state is hardly southern at all, which makes it more fertile
ground for Gore than other states in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman might not help Gore in Florida as much as the very
popular US Senator Bob Graham, who was also under consideration as
Gore's running mate, might have, but he does change the equation
here, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator is ``a godsend'' said Susan MacManus, a
political scientist at the University of South Florida, Tampa.
Voters in Florida are 53 percent female, and comprise the oldest
electorate in the country. In 1996, 40 percent of those who voted
were over 60, MacManus said. Those voters carried Clinton to
victory in Florida in 1996, and made his 1992 defeat in the state a
narrow one.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, whose brother Jeb is the popular
governor of Florida, has made inroads among those female and
elderly voters, she said, mostly by trying to tie the vice
president to Clinton's sins. Lieberman may allow Gore a way out of
that pigeonhole in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does bring the morality issue to the forefront,'' MacManus
said. ``He gives undecided, particularly female, voters _ wavering
towards George W. because of the morality issue _ some excuse to go
back to their ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction is that I feel very comfortable with Joe
Lieberman,'' said Jacques Abitan, a Miami travel wholesaler and
Morroccan immigrant, who is Jewish. ``Yesterday, I definitely
probably would vote for Bush. Today, I'm ready to listen to both of
them. I have to give Gore credit for his choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Abitan said his new open-mindedness was due to Lieberman's
integrity, and had nothing to do with the fact that the senator is
Jewish. ``I think it would be very wrong for Jews to vote for
Lieberman just because he's Jewish,'' Abitan said.
</P>
<P>
   But some local political organizers said Lieberman's faith alone
is shifting people's positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``His selection has energized people both ways,'' says Barbara
Miller, active in in the Fort Lauderdale area. ``Those who are
afraid and those who are attracted. A lot of Jewish people are
afraid to have a Jew spotlighted because there has been the belief
that that has brought some repercussions.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Miller said, her own son, who usually eschews politics,
said he was going to become involved in Gore's campaign after his
selection of Lieberman. Others are less optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalie Phillips, a Sunrise Lakes retiree with a ready supply of
Jewish mother jokes was torn Tuesday. She is Jewish, and was proud
that Lieberman had been chosen, but worried that he wouldn't help
Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a staunch democrat,'' she said. ``But I'm hoping this
won't be a detriment to us. It will make religion a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It pained her, but Phillips conceded that she would have
preferred the Vice President choose a sure winner than a Jewish
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his campaign have clearly decided Lieberman is both.
</P>
<P>
   And so has Edie Booke, the fast-talking lifeguard at Sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he's the greatest!'' she yelled when she realized who
everybody was talking about. ``The best thing. And I'm not talking
religion. If you looked at the other five guys Gore looked at,
(Lieberman) was so clean!''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Maltz, a man who gave his age as ``two years younger than
God,'' also downplayed talk of religion in talking of the
Lieberman's religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people are way beyond that now,'' he
said. ``You got these fringe people, but the majority of American
people won't care that he's Jewish. They'll go for his integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said the majority of American people won't care
about Lieberman, period. They say a vice presidential nominee has
little effect on people's decisions in November, particularly after
the initial flurry over their selection dies down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When push comes to shove, the nominee's choice of Vice
President says more about presidential candidate,'' said Kane, the
pollster. ``It's the first real decision voters get to see the
person make. It's not who he picks so much as person he picks is
somebody he respects and trusts.''

IPO MARKET HOT AGAIN AFTER TECH MELTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The IPO market has sprung back to record territory, after
slowing to a near halt when technology stocks plunged in April.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, networking, telecom, and Web infrastructure
companies are leading the charge, not e-commerce companies, and
biotech companies are making their biggest showing ever.
</P>
<P>
   So far in August, 33 companies nationwide have sold shares to
the public for the first time, and another 39 are lined up to be
priced in the coming week, according to Thomson Financial
Securities Data. If this pace keeps up, it will easily outrun the
65 IPOs completed in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO market is clearly in an upswing,'' said George
Nichols, IPO analyst for Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. ``We're
finally seeing quality names coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the stream of software, Web, and telecommunications
companies heading for the public markets, the summer surprise is
biotech and pharmaceutical IPOs _ likely fueled by the acute
interest in the recent decoding of the human genome. Suddenly,
biotech, which enjoys sporadic interest among venture capitalists
and other investors, is hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech is the latest issue to be in vogue,'' said Richard
Peterson, IPO expert at Thomson Financial Securities Data in Newark
</P>
<P>
   According to his research, the nation has seen 35 biotech deals
so far this year, raising a record $3.3 billion. In 1999, 11 IPOs
in the sector raised $2.5 billion, he said. The largest number of
biotech deals completed was 51 in 1996; Peterson predicts a new
record by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, drug research and life sciences companies that have
gone public since late June, such as Cambridge's Variagenics Inc.,
Wilmington-based Charles River Laboratories, and Billerica-based
Bruker Daltonics Inc., have seen their shares jump close to 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that, across all industries, the most
popular IPOs are seeing huge, first-day pops in their prices,
sometimes into the triple digits. But these aren't the
consumer-oriented Web stocks that stoked the euphoria of the first
quarter. The big winners lately are networking, telecom, and Web
infrastructure companies.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five biggest-returning IPOs nationally since May are
headquartered in Massachusetts. Leading the pack is Sonus Networks
Inc., a Westford telecom infrastructure player, whose stock has
soared 1,035 percent since May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of StorageNetworks Inc., a Waltham data storage company,
have jumped 385 percent since June 30, while Boston-based
Speechworks International has seen its shares fly 392 percent since
Aug. 1. And Avici Systems Inc., a North Billerica maker of
high-speed data networking equipment, went public July 28 and its
shares have gained 305 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For high-tech entrepreneurs and the venture capitalists who
finance them, the stellar gains follow a brief period of gloom. The
Nasdaq composite index lost one-quarter of its value in a brisk
week in April, and its recovery has been modest and slow. While
investors appear to have regained confidence in technology stocks,
many have come back with higher standards than they had before the
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO market functions on a binge-and-purge basis,''
Morningstar's Nichols said. ``I don't think this market can support
quantity _ just quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Small investors often are missing the fast, early gains in the
hot stocks, Thomson's Peterson said. He pointed out that, of 70
IPOs this year that doubled in the first day, more than 50 are now
trading below their first-day closing price.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're the typical, average investor, more likely than not
you've lost money,'' Peterson said. ``It's a very difficult market
to be successful in.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100 companies delayed or canceled stock offerings in
April and May, analysts said, and the stronger of those companies
are now coming back for second tries.
</P>
<P>
   Companies expected to complete IPOs this week include Radview
Software Ltd. of Burlington; Intrinsix Corp., a Westborough
semiconductor maker; and Medicines Co., a Cambridge pharmaceutical
company. McData Corp., a Colorado company spun off from Hopkinton
storage giant EMC Corp., is also slated to sell shares to the
public for the first time.

   MEXICO-ABORTION _ MEXICO CITY _ Women have erupted into protest
over a new anti-abortion law in Mexican President-elect Vicente
Fox's home state of Guanajuato. Last week, that state's local
congress suddenly passed by one vote a new provision of the
criminal code that makes abortion illegal even in the case of rape.
The vote provoked a crisis in Fox's party, the conservative
National Action, the PAN, which, along with Fox, has portrayed
itself as more middle-of-the-road of late. The PAN's national
leadership was angered by the vote _ some openly denounced it _ and
Fox distanced himself from the action by saying he had no intention
of pursuing such a ban. Opponents say the current PAN governor of
Guanajuato has an option to veto the law, which he might do, or
other legislators will put up a fight to have it struck down.
Abortion is illegal in Mexico, but in all states it can be sought
in the case of rape. Just as Fox is preparing to take office Dec.
1, the PAN has been damaged. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

always bad; Rosemond isn't so sure. This points up a difference
that divides even conserative soul-mates: Laura puts the child at
the center of the universe and Rosemond puts the parents there. We
also inquire of parents: What does this dispute say about the value
of parenting experts, whose advice floods the media? (Harris,

   BAT-PROJECT _ SAN LUIS VALLEY, Colo. _ When San Luis Valley
residents wake up each morning, there are 2 tons fewer bugs outside
than there were the night before. Tons of bugs disappear each
night, especially in summer, not that the farmers mind. They're
glad, and so is everyone else. And the fact that they have bats to
thank for the insect eradication doesn't seem to bother anyone.
Bats, it turns out, aren't the bloodthirsty villains often
portrayed in books and movies. They're vital to many Colorado
ecosystems and, in the case of the San Luis Valley, vital to the
economy because of crops saved from insects. And bats are being
unintentionally exterminated. Throughout the United States,
destruction of bat habitat is driving them into abandoned mines. In
the last 20 years, mines have been closed to ensure public safety,
but with little thought to the bats possibly living inside. (Grand

LAWSUITS AND SENATORS' BILL SEEK BENEFITS FOR PERMATEMPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes contingent labor text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in good times, there is a lot to be said for a steady job
with paid vacation, sick time, health benefits, a pension, and a
paycheck as regular as a time clock.
</P>
<P>
   These thoughts had settled deep in Moira Casey's mind the day
she threw up her hands two years ago and decided to do more than
just talk about equity.
</P>
<P>
   Casey became the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit
challenging the use of permatemps by the Atlantic Ritchfield Co.
(Arco), now BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   Permatemp is a 1990s expression, a byproduct of the new economy.
It refers to people who work the same hours and have the same jobs
as full-time employees but are classified as part-timers, even
though they have been with the company for years. Others are leased
out by contract firms.
</P>
<P>
   Most are ineligible for benefits, such as medical, dental,
retirement, paid vacation, and stock options. That's why some
employers rely on them: Permatemps can help trim the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a federal judge in Los Angeles dismissed the lawsuit
brought by Casey and a dozen others who contended that Arco had
illegally classified them as temps to avoid paying retirement
benefits. The judge ruled, as Arco had argued, that the workers
were considered leased employees and, as such, had no legal right
to company-paid pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly four months after the ruling, US Senators Edward M.
Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Robert Torricelli, Democrat
of New Jersey, have proposed a bill that would amend the Employment
Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA, to prohibit the
misclassification of full-time workers as leased, temporary,
part-time, contingent, or contract workers.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Employee Benefit Eligibility Fairness Act of 2000,
the bill requires employers to use objective criteria, based on the
actual terms and conditions of employment, to determine whether
contingent workers are eligible for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent court cases demonstrate the need to clarify ERISA to
make certain employers do not miscategorize employees as
independent contractors or temporary workers for the purpose of
excluding them from employee benefit plans,'' the senators said in
a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Casey's lawsuit was not the first. Two years ago, temps and
independent contractors at Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric in California won
a similar lawsuit when a judge ruled they were common-law
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the US Department of Labor sued Time Warner Inc.,
alleging that the company had denied pensions and health benefits
to some full-time journalists by misclassifying them as temps or
independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a lawsuit against Microsoft Corp., which for nearly a
decade has waged a legal battle over the classification of
independent contractors, has been decided in favor of the
plaintiffs. Those workers, many of them technical staff who had
been with the company for years, had sought benefits such as stock
options, which were routinely offered to permanent employees.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the matter likely will gain more public attention,
because the number of contingent employees entering the work force
is increasing, and many are working at the same job longer than a
few weeks or months. The result is the permatemp, a new species of
the part-time or temporary worker whose appearance at the office is
now as regular as that of the veteran full-time employee.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 30 report, the General Accounting Office reported that
up to 30 percent of the US work force, about 39 million Americans,
are contingent workers, a category that also includes short-term
temps and highly paid contractors who negotiate their own hours and
wages.
</P>
<P>
   Not all employers are looking to cut corners. Many use
contingent workers on a short-term basis to accommodate workload
fluctuations, fill in temporary absences, screen applicants for
permanent jobs, and help permanent workers gain more flexibility,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some employers are relying on permatemps to
help avoid paying benefits, reduce compensation costs, prevent
unionizing, or mask layoffs, the GAO said. These situations have
led to a flurry of lawsuits by contingent workers seeking full
employment or benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have responded by scrambling to adopt protective
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management lawyers are now telling their clients that they
should develop waiver agreements that state that the employee, or
the independent contractor, will waive his or her right to any
benefits,'' said David Stobaugh, a Seattle attorney who has
represented several permatemps, including Casey. ``These are
bilateral agreements, and the goal is to absolve the employer from
knowingly and intentionally misclassifying employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy-Torricelli bill, which will likely face tough going
in a mostly Republican Congress, would disqualify such waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The senators contend that really independent contractors do not
need waivers, because their work automatically defines the terms of
their employment. The true independent contractor, they say,
controls how and where he or she works, including whether to do the
actual job or hire a subcontractor. By contrast, the employer
controls the hours, work, and even the ideas of the permanent,
full-time employee.
</P>
<P>
   Before she filed suit, Casey had been a permatemp at an
Alaska-based division of Arco in the Bering Sea for nearly 10
years. The 43-year-old Vancouver woman says she held three
different jobs at the company and each lasted about three years.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lawyer, Paul Ondrasik of Washington, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I was making $12 per hour,'' Casey said.
``But the last job I had as an environmental technician paid $20 an
hour. We would get some benfits, but they were not what the Arco
employees got, by a long stretch. I'd be in a job, and then Arco
would change contract companies, and then I would have to start my
benefits over again, and there would be a waiting period of up to
one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating to have been there so long and to be
treated so differently from the full-time people,'' she continued.
``We were referred to as subemployees, which meant less than
regular employees, but we did the same work. If there was a
position open within Arco, regular Arco employees could apply, but
we couldn't. When we got laid off, we got nothing, nothing at all.
But when Arco people got laid off, they got (severance) packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Casey has a full-time job in British Columbia as an
executive secretary. ``I have to say that I would never do that
type of work again,'' she said of her previous employment. ``But at
43 I really care about benefits. At 20, I didn't care. Now, I am in
a panic. I'm thinking about retirement and the fact that I have
zero, but I'm not going to win the lottery.''

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A June 30 report by the General Accounting Office on contingent
work in the United States found:
</P>
<P>
   _Since 1982 the number of temporary help jobs has grown 577
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _Up to 30 percent of the US work force, or 39 million people,
now hold contingent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _21 percent are included in employer-sponsored pension or
retirement plans. By contrast, 64 percent of all full-time workers
are part of a company-backed pension.
</P>
<P>
   _Most contingent workers are employed in the service industry.
</P>
<P>
   _Most agency temps, on-call workers, and day laborers would
prefer a permanent, full-time job. One reason: Some 30 percent of
all agency temps earn below $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   _Most independent contractors, self-employed contingents, and
standard part-time workers prefer the flexibility of such work.
These workers, unlike agency temps, are more likely to be employed
in professional services such as nurses, engineers, computer
professionals or accountants.

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S PUTIN VOWS TO 'WIPE OUT' TERRORISTS AFTER DEADLY
BOMBING
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to calm rising
tensions here Wednesday about the possibility of more terrorist
acts in Russia's capital, while authorities searched for those
responsible for the blast that killed at least seven people and
wounded 100 others.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service, Russia's primary intelligence
agency, reaffirmed that it was treating Tuesday's deadly bombing as
a terrorist act and said it did not rule out as suspects the
guerrillas fighting against Russian forces in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov and other rebel leaders have
denied that they were responsible for the blast that rocked
downtown Moscow's busiest intersection, Pushkin Square.
</P>
<P>
   Putin vowed in a nationally televised address that the bombers
would be caught and the government would successfully wipe out
``terrorists'' _ a word the Kremlin has used to describe Chechens
throughout the 11-month war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humankind has not developed any other effective way of
combatting terror, except one. And this is the only remedy, a
response in kind. We should carry through what we are doing in the
North Caucasus and finish off the terrorists in their lair,'' Putin
said, referring to the region where Chechnya is located.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials, under pressure to make a breakthrough after
Putin said he was taking personal responsibility for the case, said
they arrested two men in their 20s, one of whom they described as
an ethnic Chechen. Authorities said the two matched descriptions
given by survivors of the blast of men who were last seen at the
site of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's attack comes nearly one year after blasts destroyed
three multi-story apartment buildings in Moscow, killing more than
300 people. Those explosions were blamed on Chechens, and led to a
renewed military campaign in the southern province. No one has been
charged in connection with those bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday, Putin urged Russians not to seek
retribution against ethnic minorities for the latest attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to look for any ethnic connection, to look
for Chechen or any other ethnic connection. In general, it is not
really right when we put a label on a whole people because
criminals, above all terrorists, have neither nationality nor
religion,'' said Putin, who has been criticized by international
human rights organizations for the Russian army's treatment of
Chechen civilians in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mood in Moscow was visibly ugly. Those paying their
condolences at the bomb site Wednesday said they had no doubt about
who was behind the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good Chechen is a dead Chechen,'' said Alexei
Medvedev, a 24-year-old student. ``They won't get away with this.''
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports Wednesday on the casualty toll.
Interior Minister Vladimir Rushaillo said the death toll was seven,
with 93 people receiving medical treatment. But city authorities
said an eighth person died overnight from wounds received in the
blast. They also put the number of wounded at 103.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the explosive device, which was probably left near
a theater ticket kiosk in the passageway beneath Pushkin Square _ a
busy intersection equivalent to New York's Times Square. The bomb
was between 1 pound and 3.3 pounds, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite extensive damage, police on Wednesday morning reopened
the tunnels, which link three subway lines and two major streets,
after an initial clean-up operation. The entrances and walkways
were dotted with flowers left by mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Moscow, police stepped up security after
authorities found a suitcase containing nine pounds of dynamite at
a lost luggage office at the city's Kazansky railway station on
Wednesday.

TEAMSTER WOES DETAILED NATIONWIDE BY FILMMAKERS

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allegations of strong-arm tactics, mob ties, and favoritism in
Boston Teamsters' dealings with the movie industry _ currently
being probed by a federal grand jury _ have been variously
described as disturbing and overblown.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing they apparently are not, according to union
officials, is unique.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of Teamsters locals across the country reveals
widespread problems with those who deal with movie and television
productions, resulting in the suspension and firing of union
officials and even criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for example, a powerful member of Local 25 has
allegedly intimidated movie officials into renting equipment from a
company he runs on the side. In Honolulu last year, a local
Teamster was convicted of torching trailers belonging to a rival
rental company.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, disgruntled rank-and-file union members say that
lucrative film and TV work goes to a select group of members, many
of whom have criminal records and ties to organized crime. Similar
allegations have dogged local union officials in Florida, Texas,
and Illinois, contributing to their locals being taken over the
international union.
</P>

   The reason problems are so rampant in the Teamsters' dealings
with the movie industry, specialists say, is that the glamorous and
cushy jobs are often used to curry loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Those who get the jobs remain loyal in order to keep them;
others, hopeful to one day make it onto the coveted movie lists,
are cowed into silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a closed system that feeds on itself,'' said one
local member of Teamsters For a Democratic Union, the reform
faction of the 1.5 million-member union. ``It becomes a retro-power
center in the local and it is only natural for that to connect with
corruption and organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 report to Congress, the Independent Review Board, a
government-appointed watchdog group established as part of a civil
settlement between the Teamsters and the Justice Department,
apparently agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Teamsters Local 714 in Chicago, review board
investigation found that nepotism and favoritism were the guiding
criteria for assigning the best work controlled by the local.
</P>
<P>
   Control of that work _ the movie and trade-show business _
contributed to control of the 10,000-member local by members of one
family, the review board report said. In fact, the board found that
there hadn't been a contested election for a union office since at
least 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Other locals have had similar troubles, including Local 390 in
Miami, which was placed into trusteeship by the international in
1996 due to alleged ``nepotism'' in the assigning of jobs on film
and TV shoots. The previous year, the president of Local 79 in
Tampa was suspended for giving jobs to family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, meanwhile, the IRB recommended putting Local 745 into
trusteeship after finding that the premium work under the local's
control was assigned on the basis of nepotism and favoritism. The
IRB also found that top organized crime figures from the Midwest
had infiltrated the union.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Teamster local in Rhode Island with
criminal backgrounds or ties to organized crime have landed jobs as
drivers on major film productions in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, at least four such members of Teamster
Local 251 in Providence have been working on the set of ``Osmosis
Jones,'' a movie by the Farrelly brothers being shot in the
Plymouth area.
</P>
<P>
   They include Anthony Parrillo, who was paroled in 1993 after
serving 16 years in the manslaughter death of two men. He was also
a member of the Teamster crew that worked on the Farrelly
production last year, ``Me, Myself and Irene,'' according to
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other sources say that Ronnie Carter, also a member
of Teamster Local 251 in Providence whose criminal record includes
arrests for assault with a dangerous weapon, drunk driving and
possession of cocaine, has also worked on movie productions filmed
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who helped establish the Rhode Island chapter of the
Hells Angels, is one of several men with ties to the motorcycle
gang or to organized crime who are caught up in an investigation of
the Teamster Local 251 by Rhode Island authorities. The other two
Teamsters from Local 251 in Providence who have worked on the
``Osmosis Jones'' set are: Danny Allen, a close associate of
Parrillo's who has been under investigation by Rhode Island
authorites for allegedly fencing stolen property, and Jeff
Chakoian, whose late brother had ties to the Patriarca crime
family.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 interview with Ch. 12, WPRI-TV in Providence, Stuart
Mundy, president of Local 251, defended the practice of giving the
highly-paid positions of film crew drivers to individuals with
criminal records. Parrillo was assigned based on his work record,
not his criminal record, Mundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Mundy did not return phone calls Tuesday. George Cashman,
president of Local 25 in Boston, also did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   However, a source familiar with the ``Osmosis Jones'' production
said that said that the four from the Providence local were among
more than two dozen drivers who had been hired to work on the movie
by Robert Martini, the Teamsters transportation coordinator on the
set. The others were all members of Local 25 in Boston, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martini had been pleased with Parrillo's work on last year's
movie by the Farrelly brothers, which was shot in Rhode Island,
Massachusetts and Vermont, and sought him out again this summer,
the source said. He was unable to explain how the other three
members of Local 251 had gained their jobs on the set.
</P>
<P>
   The source also said that because another major Hollywood
production is being filmed in Boston, ``What's the Worst That Could
Happen?'', there is currently a shortage of qualified Teamsters to
work on movie productions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the most contentious national security debate since the
Cold War: whether or not to build a $60 billion missile defense
system involving technologies so sophisticated that some haven't
even been invented.
</P>
<P>
   For two key players in the debate _ outspoken Massachusetts
Institute of Technology professor Ted Postol and White House Chief
of Staff John Podesta _ it's also an exercise that has degenerated
into name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that the overall impression you leave from your
correspondence,'' said Podesta in a handwritten response last week
to Postol's drubbing of the administration's antimissile plan, ``is
that your brilliance is only exceeded by your arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   Insulted, Postol fired right back with sarcasm:
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not rule out that I could be wrong _ I am not so arrogant
to deny that possibility _ and that there is some subtle point of
basic science . . . known only to you and your advisors, but not to
Nobel laureates.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, what started as a dry, substantive scientific
analysis completed its descent into shallow sniping.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words has been brewing since May when Postol, a
physicist who is one of the leading critics of pricey Pentagon
programs, sent the the White House a detailed critique explaining
why its antimissile plan won't work.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old professor was a scientific adviser to the chief
of naval operations in the 1980s. He helped develop the Trident 2
missile and believes the antimissile system's technology is unable
to distinguish between a potential enemy's decoys and real nuclear
warheads. A few balloons, he says, might be sufficient to fool the
antimissiles.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three months, Postol waited for a reply to his
pointed criticism, only to receive what he considered to be a form
letter from the White House: three paragraphs thanking him for his
interest in the issue and reiterating the president's mantra on
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of any appreciation of his critique rankled him, so the
scientist fired off a missive to Podesta:
</P>
<P>
   ``The almost comically unresponsive letter you sent to me more
than two months after being informed about these serious matters
adds to my concern that you and others on the White House staff
have not taken your responsibilities seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, neither the Pentagon nor the White House has provided
Postol with a detailed response. The administration's reticence has
also angered other scientists around the country, who have rallied
behind Postol's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Those calling for a halt in the move to deploy an antiballistic
missile force include major scientific groups such as the
Federation of American Scientists, the Union of Concerned
Scientists, the American Physical Society, and 50 Nobel
Prize-winning scientists who have called the planned system
``premature, wasteful, and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the White House responded with its ``form letter'' in
July, Postol says the administration's only response had been to
try to silence him. Shortly after the scientist's initial letter
arrived at the White House, the Pentagon classified it as secret,
making a public response impossible.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, the Pentagon dispatched agents from the
Defense Security Service to admonish Postol to keep quiet about
sensitive data.
</P>
<P>
   But Ted Postol is not a man who treads lightly over
billion-dollar programs that might not work. Nearly a decade ago,
the missile specialist gained acclaim in scientific circles and
disdain in the Pentagon after debunking the ``success'' of Raytheon
Corp.'s Patriot missile during the Gulf War. His analysis prompted
the Army and Raytheon to reduce Patriot's claimed success rate by
half.
</P>
<P>
   And the bearded, no-frills physicist doesn't take kindly to
personal attacks. He calls Podesta's note ``out of line'' and
``insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Postol's analysis, the Pentagon has rigged missile
tests to ensure success. After a 1997 test of the antimissile
revealed it couldn't effectively distinguish decoys from warheads,
he says, the Pentagon stopped using decoys that would seriously
challenge the defensive weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The physicist also accuses the Pentagon of significantly
reducing the difficulty of the next 14 tests planned before the
antimissile system would be deployed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has so far only dismissed Postol's criticism as
based on old data and plans still in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Postol, however, has warned the Pentagon and the White House not
to let science ``be perverted to serve a particular political point
of view,'' and has urged the administration to form an independent
scientific commission to study the missile plan.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Postol wrote to Podesta, ``Your single-minded loyalty
to the departing president will have served the nation poorly.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S PUTIN VOWS TO 'WIPE OUT' TERRORISTS AFTER DEADLY
BOMBING
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to calm rising
tensions here Wednesday about the possibility of more terrorist
acts in Russia's capital, while authorities searched for those
responsible for the blast that killed at least seven people and
wounded 100 others.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service, Russia's primary intelligence
agency, reaffirmed that it was treating Tuesday's deadly bombing as
a terrorist act and said it did not rule out as suspects the
guerrillas fighting against Russian forces in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov and other rebel leaders have
denied that they were responsible for the blast that rocked
downtown Moscow's busiest intersection, Pushkin Square.
</P>
<P>
   Putin vowed in a nationally televised address that the bombers
would be caught and the government would successfully wipe out
``terrorists'' _ a word the Kremlin has used to describe Chechens
throughout the 11-month war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humankind has not developed any other effective way of
combatting terror, except one. And this is the only remedy, a
response in kind. We should carry through what we are doing in the
North Caucasus and finish off the terrorists in their lair,'' Putin
said, referring to the region where Chechnya is located.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials, under pressure to make a breakthrough after
Putin said he was taking personal responsibility for the case, said
they arrested two men in their 20s, one of whom they described as
an ethnic Chechen. Authorities said the two matched descriptions
given by survivors of the blast of men who were last seen at the
site of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's attack comes nearly one year after blasts destroyed
three multi-story apartment buildings in Moscow, killing more than
300 people. Those explosions were blamed on Chechens, and led to a
renewed military campaign in the southern province. No one has been
charged in connection with those bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday, Putin urged Russians not to seek
retribution against ethnic minorities for the latest attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to look for any ethnic connection, to look
for Chechen or any other ethnic connection. In general, it is not
really right when we put a label on a whole people because
criminals, above all terrorists, have neither nationality nor
religion,'' said Putin, who has been criticized by international
human rights organizations for the Russian army's treatment of
Chechen civilians in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mood in Moscow was visibly ugly. Those paying their
condolences at the bomb site Wednesday said they had no doubt about
who was behind the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good Chechen is a dead Chechen,'' said Alexei
Medvedev, a 24-year-old student. ``They won't get away with this.''
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports Wednesday on the casualty toll.
Interior Minister Vladimir Rushaillo said the death toll was seven,
with 93 people receiving medical treatment. But city authorities
said an eighth person died overnight from wounds received in the
blast. They also put the number of wounded at 103.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the explosive device, which was probably left near
a theater ticket kiosk in the passageway beneath Pushkin Square _ a
busy intersection equivalent to New York's Times Square. The bomb
was between 1 pound and 3.3 pounds, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite extensive damage, police on Wednesday morning reopened
the tunnels, which link three subway lines and two major streets,
after an initial clean-up operation. The entrances and walkways
were dotted with flowers left by mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Moscow, police stepped up security after
authorities found a suitcase containing nine pounds of dynamite at
a lost luggage office at the city's Kazansky railway station on
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   They are a gang of 10 _ all hardened youths from Boston _ being
sent onto the campus of elite Bowdoin College to start a
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In a radical social experiment, Bowdoin has dropped its usual
admissions process and given full scholarships to a tight-knit
group of 10 underprivileged seniors, on the hope that they will
upend the school's atmosphere of advantage. Amid the age-old crew
team and debate team, these freshmen will try to gain a toehold
amid the evergreens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many kinds of revolutions,'' said Eider Gordillo, a
Colombian immigrant who once dropped out of high school and is now
headed to Bowdoin. ``I'm hoping we'll be able to bring a small
social revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordillo is among the 10 who are the first in the region to join
Posse, a privately funded non-profit that brokers admission and
financial aid from college partners like Bowdoin. In return, these
schools get minority students who show academic promise but who
might not have applied on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But the Posse strategy is a response to a growing recognition of
how alienating the poor and minorities can find exclusive schools
like Bowdoin _ and how far schools may have to go to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you want to end up catering to a very small cross
section of the country,'' said Richard Steele, Bowdoin's dean of
admissions, ``you better find ways to bridge differences, and do it
in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Posse began 11 years ago in New York, but Boston is now home to
the first branch office. Posse Boston, which recruits local youths,
receives money from the US Department of Education and a scattering
of private donors and foundations. Bowdoin is paying the tuition,
about $25,000 per student annually.
</P>
<P>
   What awaits Boston's first posse, no one can really say. A
number of teams sent from New York have done well, with about nine
out of 10 students graduating. But others have floundered so badly
that two schools dropped out of Posse.
</P>
<P>
   As Gordillo keeps an eye on his 7-year-old sister, Tita, darting
around the small rooms of the Posse Boston office, he worries aloud
about being overwhelmed, frustrated, terrified. He had never seen a
rural college like Bowdoin before. While he thinks the posse will
add new voices and accents to clubs and classrooms, his firmest
hope is that the team offers safe havens in the dorms and dining
halls for one another, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll rely on them at Bowdoin because it's a difficult
experience, defining yourself and finding what you can do in
school,'' said Gordillo, a 19-year-old with tightly wound black
hair, wearing a muscle T-shirt. ``We're leaving a lot of people
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious, tough-talking, spirited, these 10 are also still very
much teenagers. They have become like sisters and brothers during a
32-week crash course on how to make it in college. An easy
familiarity passes among the six girls, especially, as they diss
over who is the ``queen'' of the posse. (There are no kings,
apparently.)
</P>
<P>
   After each meeting, the group locks hands and swirls around a
lone member, until they have formed a ``cinnamon roll.'' Bound
together, holding close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a city girl, so I'm kind of scared,'' said Lauren Flinn,
one of two white students in the posse, and a graduate of Boston
Latin Academy. ``People don't expect kids from the city to survive
in college.''
</P>
<P>
   With the stakes high, Posse chooses carefully.
</P>
<P>
   For the ten spots, guidance counselors and community groups
nominated about 210 city youths with leadership and academic
talents, and who came from diverse or disadvantaged backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Posse staff pared the list to 27 for a team of Bowdoin
officials who came to Boston to help make the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   They sized up the finalists in interviews and a series of games.
One icebreaker was a ``human scavenger hunt'': the students and
administrators who played won points by showing off talents _
fluency in two languages, a few dance moves, the delivery of a poem
commited to memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Bowdoin, they saw the students as very real,'' said Shani
Jackson, one of the leaders of Posse Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At Brandeis University, which has taken 30 New York City
students, the posses have started a gospel choir and a ``dialogue
group'' for talking about identity and race. Most importantly, to
some at Brandeis, is that members take risks _ speaking plainly
about identity in class, or breaking racial clusters in the
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Posse student had a birthday, and other students in the
posse had a party in the dining hall _ and it was the most diverse
table Brandeis had ever seen,'' said Mimi Arnstein, a Posse
coordinator there, with a bit of wonder in her voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to be together publicly, in an intergrated group,
starts to make change,'' Arnstein added.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston group includes black, Hispanic, and white students,
many of them from poor or immigrant families. Next year, Posse
hopes to send another 10 to Bowdoin, as well as 10 to Hamilton
College, in New York, and to Bryn Mawr College, a women's school in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bowdoin's Steele could not say if the incoming 10 would have
been admitted under traditional standards. And he worries that
their writing abilities might not measure up to their future
classmates. But the Posse concept is more promising, he said, than
the typical, imperfect admissions strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've found ways to identify potential that we hadn't fully
exploited,'' Steele said. ``Posse has convincingly argued that
students' ability to relate well to peers, and endure through
difficulty, has a lot to do with success in college.''
</P>
<P>
   The Posse approach has drawn national attention for its
potential to narrow the gap between rich and poor in college. About
82 percent of high income seniors go on to college directly from
high school, compared to only 57 percent of lower-income seniors,
according to the US Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea of a team is a really interesting approach,'' said
Maureen McLaughlin, deputy assistant secretary of education. ``We
all know the climate and support for a student on campus is really
important.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Rice and Lehigh universities, the Posse teams did not
meet expectations, leading the schools to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   At Rice, a one of the nation's top engineering schools, the
curriculum was overwhelming, and the random dormitory assignments _
used by many colleges _ cut into the esprit de corps. Some felt
isolated on the 300-acre Houston campus, Rice officials said. Only
one of the 18 members graduated in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taxed so much by their academics, they were less
able than initially planned to get involved,'' said Julie Browning,
Rice's dean of undergraduate enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   But Posse officials said they have since sharpened both the
selection process and the preparation for college.
</P>
<P>
   During a Posse training session last week, a Brandeis professor,
Jane Hale, led a mock college class to give students a flavor of
the work ahead. She urged them to buy computers and hefty
dictionaries (``You're working with big words now''), and said that
studying 30 hours a week was the average _ and would get them only
average grades. (``If you want As, do more.'')
</P>
<P>
   When it came to classes, the students seemed more worried about
pleasing professors and wearing the right clothes than fomenting
debates about diversity. But each was also confident that they
could make a difference at Bowdoin.
</P>
<P>
   Gordillo, sounding more like a realist than a revolutionary,
laughed, ``We're going to bring some chocolate chips to the
cookie.''

&HT;     RISE IN HIV CASES PROMPTS CALL FOR AGGRESSIVE PREVENTION
METHODS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Faced with evidence that the rate of new HIV
infections among gay men is rising sharply, San Francisco's health
director wants to revamp prevention efforts, including a retreat
from the use-a-condom-every-time mantra that has been the heart of
most AIDS prevention campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Political correctness and the fear of being accused of blaming
the victim have kept health workers from focusing enough on
stopping people with the human immunodeficiency virus from
spreading the infection to others, according to Health Director
Mitchell H. Katz. He also wants to redirect some of the money now
spent on health campaigns into substance abuse treatment, since
many new infections are related to drug and alcohol use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any health department faced with these kinds of numbers should
be asking: How should prevention change?'' said Katz, a physician
who formerly headed the department's office on HIV and AIDS. ``What
we are proposing is a controversial retooling of the prevention
model.''
</P>
<P>
   New HIV infections in San Francisco have climbed from a low of
498 in 1997 to 790 this year, according to estimates based on an
analysis of recent data by researchers at the Health Department and
the AIDS Research Institute at the University of California at San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is an affliction
in which HIV weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to
serious infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual
contact, sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   All of the increase in San Francisco appears to be coming from
homosexual men, where the number of new infections went from 283 in
1997 to an estimated 573 this year. New infections among
heterosexuals who do not inject drugs are down to just six, from 45
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are not a surprise to public health officials, who
had already noted several early warning signs, including the
emergence of so-called ``barebacking'' parties where men gathered
to engage in unprotected sex. More HIV-positive men are also
catching sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea,
a sign that they are having unsafe sex in greater numbers.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of anti-retroviral drugs, the number of people
living with the AIDS virus has grown steadily. It is now estimated
that a third of gay men in San Francisco are HIV-positive.

   The Health Department has come up with an 11-point plan to
address the trend. For one thing, Katz said it is clear that the
blanket advice to use condoms at all times is losing its punch, as
rates of condom use have begun to drop. Instead, he wants to narrow
the focus of safe sex messages to situations of anal intercourse
between an HIV-positive man and his HIV-negative male partner.
</P>
<P>
   Katz said he wants to target more efforts at keeping people with
HIV from spreading the infection. Until now, he said, ``it's been
that HIV prevention is for negatives and HIV services are for
positives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted to be seen as being politically incorrect by
suggesting that a negative person became infected because of a
positive person,'' Katz said. ``But that's the only way it
happens.''

ALEC GUINNESS'S GENIUS ENLIVENED MANY A MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a shy smile, he called his most famous role ``my little
annuity.'' Before signing on as the only star in ``Star Wars,''
Alec Guinness got what most actors dream of: a percentage of the
gross.
</P>
<P>
   His ethereal and indestructible Jedi knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi, won
him millions of fans in 1977. A smaller number of moviegoers
already knew _ from Gulley Jimson to George Smiley, from ``Great
Expectations'' to ``Little Dorrit'' _ that Alec Guinness was a
genius.
</P>
<P>
   I once heard him read poetry as his small, even baritone
breathed life into ``Lepanto'' by G. K. Chesterton:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far,
</P>
<P>
   Don John of Austria is going to the war.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No actor enlivened as many cult films _ movies repeated and
remembered, once at repertory art cinemas and now at home. ``Kind
Hearts and Coronets'' and ``Lavender Hill Mob'' are still
hilarious. A drama that oft inhabits my VCR is ``Tunes of Glory,''
filmed in 1960. It is quintessential Alec Guinness because he plays
against type.
</P>
<P>
   Having won an Oscar in 1957 for ``Bridge on the River Kwai'' as
the stiff-necked Colonel Nicholson, he was a natural for the
stiff-necked colonel who takes over a Scottish training battalion
from the acting commander, a raffish cut-up, the specialty of
Guinness's old friend, John Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The script was turned down by every major company,'' Mills
recalled in his memoirs. He and Guinness agreed to star and to
switch. ``We would do some `offbeat' casting,'' Mills wrote. ``I
would play the neurotic, nerve-wracked Colonel Barrow, and Alec
would play the hard-drinking tough Scots colonel up from the
ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, how could the movie miss? A strong supporting
cast included Dennis Price, Gordon Jackson, Duncan Macrae, Kay
Walsh, and, in her debut, a luminous Susannah York. The screenplay,
by a young British novelist, James Kennaway, was a business manual
on tradition, transition, and decision-making based on ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness, in red mustache and crewcut, sparkles. In the
officers' mess on the eve of the new colonel's arrival, his
character, Jock Sinclair, declares: ``Corporal, whiskey for the
gentleman that like it. And for the gentlemen that don't like it,
whiskey!''
</P>
<P>
   As Guinness plans a big funeral, a major, played by Dennis
Price, interrupts. ``Quite an elaborate do, this,'' he says.
``Brigade will never permit it.'' Guinness retorts with an anthem
for obituary writers everywhere: ``To hell with brigade! The way we
bury our colonels is ours and ours alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies were not the first, or even second, love of Alec
Guinness. He preferred the theater, with its gossip and
conviviality, and the lonelier art of writing. He cherished an
Oscar nomination for his screenplay based on Joyce Cary's novel
``The Horse's Mouth'' in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   On location in Ceylon for ``River Kwai,'' he and Jack Hawkins
learned that William Holden got no set fee but a piece of the
profits. When George Lucas recruited him for ``Star Wars,''
Guinness remembered.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1999 memoir, ``A Positively Final Appearance,'' Guinness
voiced regrets about his ``little annuity.'' ``I shrivel inside
each time it is mentioned,'' he wrote. ``When it was first shown,
it had a freshness, also a sense of moral good and fun. But it has
led to a worldwide taste for a fantasy world of secondhand,
childish banalities.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Guinness character plans bagpipe funeral marches in the
Scottish highlands, he gets flustered, naming ``The Black Bear''
and ``Scotland the Brave,'' then demanding of Duncan Macrae:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some others, Pipe Major.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Cock of the North,' sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yon's a cheesy tune. You'll no play that!''
</P>
<P>
   Let no cheesy tunes echo at the funeral of the great artist Alec
Guinness. As Jock Sinclair promised his officers, ``We'll have all
the tunes of glory, to remember the more clearly.''

&HT;     MEXICAN PRESIDENT-ELECT SEEKS A NORTH AMERICAN COMMON MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Filed in the ``a'' and ``f'' categories; note optional
trim)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BILL DAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The North American Free Trade Agreement, enacted
in 1994, is widely credited with encouraging the reforms that led
to Vicente Fox's election last month as Mexico's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fox wants to expand the trade relationship between his
country, Canada and the United States, and possibly extend free
trade throughout South America. Fox is traveling in Argentina,
Brazil, Chile and Uruguay this week and will be in Ottawa and
Washington later this month discussing trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has proposed forming a common market similar to the European
Union, comprising the United States, Mexico and Canada, and
eventually linking such an organization with the budding South
American common market known as Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   A common market would go much further than NAFTA's abolition of
tariffs between its signatory parties. A North American common
market would more closely link Mexican, Canadian and American
economic and social policy, and would present a united front when
establishing trade pacts with other nations and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   As with the European Union, which is a 15-nation pact covering
much of Western Europe, a North American common market could also
lead to a common currency _ mostly likely the U.S. dollar _ and the
ability of workers in each country to freely move between the
others.
</P>
<P>
   It is these two points that will likely be Fox's main obstacles
both at home and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that it'll hurt the U.S. economy, which
is largely wrong in my opinion,'' said Steve Golub, an economics
professor at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. ``But another idea
is true: In industries where companies compete directly with
companies in those countries, it will hurt them, and they'll lobby
against it tooth and nail.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada may or may not be a willing partner. The original free
trade agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, when Conservative
Brian Mulroney was prime minister. After the agreement was enacted,
Mulroney was replaced by Liberal Jean Chretien. Chretien's minister
of foreign affairs, Lloyd Axworthy, was an ardent free trade
critic, though the new government has warmed to NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Trites, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade, points out that as president-elect, Fox has no
official standing to discuss policy with the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should these views become Mexican government policy, then
Canada will be pleased to examine any proposal put forward,''
Trites said. ``Until then, it would be premature to speculate on
such matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the
party Fox beat for the presidency, is likely to use its power in
the National Assembly to oppose replacing the peso with the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tradeoff there,'' Golub said. ``The benefit is you
get stable money and avoid crashes, and that can encourage
investment. The cost is a political cost. It's a huge chunk of
sovereignty you're giving up to the gringo dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox may be aided in his quest for a common market by the recent
``dollarization'' of Ecuador, and a proposal in Argentina to tie
that country's economy to the U.S. currency. But in those cases,
supporters opted for dollars because their own currencies were
weak.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's peso is relatively strong and weathered Fox's election
without the devaluation that often accompanies a presidential
transition.
</P>
<P>
   It is significant, observers say, that Fox chose to undertake
this foreign trade initiative a little more than a month after his
election victory and four months before Dec. 1, when he officially
assumes office.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fox's candidacy was linked early on with NAFTA. Not only is he a
former Coca-Cola executive with strong support for international
trade, but he was also a beneficiary of the government reforms
President Ernesto Zedillo instituted to encourage foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   This year saw Mexico's first-ever primary elections.
Traditionally, the president _ always a member of the PRI until Fox
ended the party's lock on power _ simply picked his successor.
Meanwhile, NAFTA has helped expand Mexico's middle class, which
boosted Fox's National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fox wants to do more. He argues a North American or
hemispheric common market would increase Mexico's standard of
living. Fox maintains that narrowing the gap in wages between
American and Mexican workers will slow illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   He will press that point in meetings with President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore in Washington on Aug. 24, and the next day
when he meets with GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   While both Gore and Bush favor NAFTA and free trade in general,
creating a common market would be a tough sell in Congress. Shoyer
said such an idea would ``raise a litany of controversies,''
including labor, environmental and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Golub agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will happen anytime soon,'' he said. ``Chile
wanted to get in on NAFTA a few years ago, and they deserved to,
but the U.S. didn't want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in a few years, if prosperity continues and it doesn't
look like the (trade) deal with China or NAFTA are hurting
industries, it might have a chance.''

RABBI'S BOOK EXTOLS THE HEALING POWER OF THE PSALMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Samuel Chiel speaks of the healing power of psalms, he
speaks from personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, when he suffered his first mild heart attack, he began
to fear for his future.
</P>
<P>
   He found himself turning for strength to Psalm 30, which
includes the verse ``weeping may linger for the night, but joy
comes in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiel survived that heart attack, an eventual bypass operation,
and now he recites that psalm daily. And, at the age of 73, the
Newton, Mass. rabbi has written a new book about the healing power
of psalms, called ``For Thou Art With Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, co-authored by Chiel's nephew, health writer Henry
Dreher, is meant as a kind of solace for those in crisis. In the
book, Chiel walks readers through 15 of the 150 psalms, offering
anecdotes and commentary to flesh out their meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are great religious poets who deal with virtually every
human emotion _ despair, joy, exaltation, sadness, betrayal _
virtually all the human emotions that each one of us experiences,
and they connect those emotions and human aspirations to God,''
Chiel said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The psalms are part of the third section of the Hebrew Bible.
They have traditionally been attributed to King David, but most
scholars believe that although David may have authored some of the
poems, there are also numerous other poets who contributed over
several centuries nearly 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The psalms are a basic part of Jewish ritual liturgy, but in
recent centuries they have arguably been even more popular among
Christians, some of whom read them daily or include them in
liturgical prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psalms are universally loved by Jews and Christians and
others who may not be of these faiths but who love the psalms as
literature,'' Chiel said.
</P>
<P>
   Judaism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries shifted away
from the raw spirituality associated with the psalms, but began to
move back late in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Jews, Christians, and people who may not be part of
either faith are looking for some deeper understanding of what the
meaning of life ought to be,'' Chiel said. ``There's much more talk
by rabbis about God now. There's a renewal of interest in God and
spirituality and in finding that meaning in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiel is best known for his 27 years as the rabbi of Temple
Emanuel in Newton, the largest conservative congregation in New
England. Retired since 1995, he is now a scholar-in-residence at
Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston and an adviser to
the president of Hebrew College.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Chiel offers numerous examples of how the psalms
have affected his life, those of some of his congregants, and
famous people such as Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey and Natan
Sharansky, the Soviet dissident turned Israeli politician.
</P>
<P>
   He says his book, which he calls a ``handbook for the soul,'' is
aimed at individuals in crisis, many of whom, he says, have asked
him for something to read to give them hope or strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their lyrical expressions of faith, their powerful
imagery, and their uninhibited evocation of passionated feeling,
the psalms speak to people in every imaginable crisis,'' Chiel
writes.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautions that the psalms should not be seen as a source
of a miraculous cure, but rather of spiritual healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``God does not respond to our prayers the way a first-class
mail-order company faithfully delivers its products,'' he writes.
``Being heard by God, though, cures our spiritual isolation. That
is itself a profound form of healing beyond biological recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the psalms ``millennial sources of comfort,''
contrasting them with much of the grief literature now available.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many trees have been sacrificed for self-help books that
spin out the same theme with less eloquence and economy?'' he asks.
``There is something uniquely stirring about reciting these
timeless words, knowing that we are connected to generations who
have turned to these same verses.''

 &HT;    Colorado bat program aimed at protecting, promoting the flying
mammals
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. - When San Luis Valley residents wake up
each morning, there are 2 tons fewer bugs outside than there were
the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of bugs disappear each night, especially in summer, not
that the farmers mind. They're glad, and so is everyone else. And
the fact that they have bats to thank for the insect eradication
doesn't seem to bother anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Bats, it turns out, aren't the bloodthirsty villains often
portrayed in books and movies. They're vital to many Colorado
ecosystems and, in the case of the San Luis Valley, vital to the
economy because of crops saved from insects. And bats are being
unintentionally exterminated.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the United States, destruction of bat habitat is
driving them into abandoned mines. In the past 20 years, mines have
been closed to ensure public safety, but with little thought to the
bats possibly living inside.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the North American Bats and Mines Project, a
national initiative to seal abandoned mines with bat-friendly
gates, has been gaining momentum. Since the 1990s, said project
director Sheryl Ducommon, hundreds of mines in the United States
and Canada have been sealed with bat gates that make it easy for
bats to get in and out of the mine, but still prevent people from
entering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are closing mines are not intentionally trying
to rid the earth of bats,'' she said. ``They're trying to ensure
the safety of the general public. But as an unfortunate consequence
they've closed mines when bats are hibernating in winter or in
summer when they're in the mines with their babies.''
</P>
<P>
   She said 10 percent to 15 percent of abandoned mines are
critical for bat use and 60 percent to 70 percent show evidence of
bat use. Considering Colorado's 50,000 abandoned mines, that may
mean a lot of bats affected by mine closures.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Luis Valley, a colony of about 250,000 Mexican
free-tailed bats roosts in the old Orient Mine. They're the ones
that eat the 2 tons of bugs each night and help preserve the area's
rich agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   At a bat conservation and mine closure workshop July 19 and 20
in Grand Junction, Kirk Navo of the Colorado Division of Wildlife
said biologists, bat conservationists and mine owners have been
through almost 3,000 of Colorado's mines and found bats or evidence
of bats in many of them.
</P>
<P>
   In western Colorado the most common bats are Townsend's
big-eared bats, little and big brown bats, fringed myotis, pallid
bats, Yuma myotis and long-legged myotis. As many as 14 of
Colorado's 18 bat species rely on abandoned mines for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bats seen in Colorado are migratory and seasonal
residents, or are tree and boulder roosting. But because of
increased wilderness use and environmental destruction, bats are
being driven into mines. Bat-friendly mine gates ensure that date
bats.
</P>
<P>
   In the western United States, one of the most sensitive species
is the Townsend's big-eared bat, which is dependent on abandoned
mine habitat, Ducommon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gated hundreds and hundreds of mines for Townsend's
big-eared bat,'' she said. ``We'll potentially keep the species
from being threatened or endangered, and if we can keep them off
the federal threatened or endangered species list, there are so
many more management options.''
</P>
<P>
   Navo said the fringed myotis is a concern because they have been
found in several old uranium mines in western Colorado, and uranium
mines are being closed quickly and frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Ducommon said the project also offers public education to help
dispel myths about bats and make people care that they're being
closed in mines. Often when biologists are in an area surveying
mines for bats, they speak at schools and in community meetings to
discuss rabies concerns, bats' economic and environmental impact
and how they're not birds or reptiles, but mammals. The goal,
Ducommon said, is to make the public aware of bats so mine owners
will have biologists survey a mine before sealing it with the wrong
kind of gate or with a mound of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strange creature for some people,'' Ducommon said.
``People don't understand bats all that much sometimes. But once
they find out how fascinating they are, how beneficial to the
economy, they have an interest.''
</P>

closure, call the North American Bats and Mines Project,

can safely get out, Ducommon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bat gates are like normal mine closure gates except the spaces
between bars are horizontal rather than vertical. Made of steel or
other sturdy metals, the gate's bars are spaced about 5 3/8 inches
apart, wide enough for bats to fly through easily but not wide
enough for people to get through, Ducommon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With horizontal bar placement, it allows bats unimpeded
access,'' she said. ``They can kind of tuck and go through the
bars. But if the bars are vertical, they have to turn, bank up on
their sides, and it's much more difficult.''

<P>
   The North American Bats and Mines Project is working with the
Colorado Division of Wildlife and U.S. Bureau of Land Management to
survey mines for bats and work for bat-friendly closure. The
project has funded hundreds of bat gates, Ducommon said, but added
that bat-friendly gates are not more expensive than regular gates.
Project representatives also put on workshops to discuss bat
conservation and show others how to make bat gates.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cave Conservation Association also is working with
the North American Bats and Mines Project to protect bats who roost
in caves, Ducommon said, and there are more than 700 known caves in
Colorado. In caves, however, the danger for bats is the increased
popularity of caving, which can affect the environment and
temperature of the cave _ both critical factors in whether a
habitat will accommodate bats.
</P>
<P>
   In the western United States, one of the most sensitive species
is the Townsend's big-eared bat, which is dependent on abandoned
mine habitat, Ducommon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gated hundreds and hundreds of mines for Townsend's
big-eared bat,'' she said. ``We'll potentially keep the species
from being threatened or endangered, and if we can keep them off
the federal threatened or endangered species list, there are so
many more management options.''
</P>
<P>
   Navo said the fringed myotis is a concern because they have been
found in several old uranium mines in western Colorado, and uranium
mines are being closed quickly and frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Ducommon said the project also offers public education to help
dispel myths about bats and make people care that they're being
closed in mines. Often when biologists are in an area surveying
mines for bats, they speak at schools and in community meetings to
discuss rabies concerns, bats' economic and environmental impact
and how they're not birds or reptiles, but mammals. The goal,
Ducommon said, is to make the public aware of bats so mine owners
will have biologists survey a mine before sealing it with the wrong
kind of gate or with a mound of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strange creature for some people,'' Ducommon said.
``People don't understand bats all that much sometimes. But once
they find out how fascinating they are, how beneficial to the
economy, they have an interest.''
</P>

closure, call the North American Bats and Mines Project,

 &HT;    Dallas designer Faircloth suits Laura Bush to a T
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - People expect a first lady, whether of
Texas or of the United States, to have a certain look _ feminine,
professional and conservative, regardless of her political
leanings.
</P>
<P>
   Should she monkey with that formula even a tad, they'll let her
know.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas designer Michael Faircloth creates the outfits that Laura
Bush wears for public appearances, including the half-dozen suits
she packed for last week's Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   When he stitched a lace panel _ a very fashion-forward detail _
into the hem of one of her campaign-trail skirts, the citizens
quickly cast their votes. ``We got numerous comments that her slip
was showing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Future lace panels were vetoed, but Faircloth hasn't ruled out
runway influences entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly make gentle nods toward fashion trends, keeping
in mind what works best for her figure,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He finds inspiration in trendy trims, colors and textures, but
``the vast majority of what's in fashion right now, the first lady
would not be wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what Mrs. Bush does wear:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sculpted suits worn without blouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Bush is very practical. Too many layers gets too
confusing,'' Faircloth says.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it's easier for Faircloth to achieve a slim, clean-lined
look without throwing a blouse into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Feminine shapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to design for a feminine figure, and Mrs. Bush
certainly has a nice, feminine figure,'' he says. To emphasize her
gentle curves, Faircloth fits her suits close to her body and keeps
her skirts slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go by specific sizes, but she's close to an 8,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shorter jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Because she's not wearing a blouse, the jackets stay permanently
buttoned. That means Mrs. Bush can't undo a button when sitting
down, so a shorter jacket makes sitting easier.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Slim skirts, bright, clear colors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush has bright blue eyes, so blues and greens are
especially pretty on her. Although she favors neutral tones,
Faircloth says, those don't read as well on television.
</P>
<P>
   All told, it's a uniform that Mrs. Bush, a casual dresser in her
personal life, has grown into over the last several years.
``Through her public appearances, we've adopted this look that's
easy for her to maintain and to look sharp and also is very
functional,'' Faircloth says.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, 40, met Mrs. Bush through mutual friends seven years
ago when husband George W. first ran for governor of Texas. When he
isn't designing for her or buzzing around Dallas helping her pick
out accessories, Faircloth creates looks for Big D socialites as
well as a worldwide clientele that drops by the Lily Dodson
boutique where he works as the full-time in-house designer.
</P>
<P>
   Lily Dodson is the only place to buy the Faircloth label, which
sports prices similar to those by his New York counterparts, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Is Faircloth, a native Texan, ready to relocate to Washington,
D.C.?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given that any consideration yet,'' he says.
``There's always airlines.''

DARWIN'S A NATURAL; COVER-GIRL PUFFERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All it takes is a little straight talk to notice again how much
bald-faced balderdash we are served every day, usually in the
service of increased sales. There's a bunch of it on magazine racks
right now.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the ounce of clarity, from David Weinberger in the
new Darwin, the second-ever edition of the Framingham-based
business magazine. From his opening salvo (``Marketing is a hostile
act''), he attacks the ugly patina that covers practically all
consumer-corporation encounters.
</P>
<P>
   They view us, he says, as ``them.'' They strive to control every
interaction; speak in stilted, dehumanizing terms; and consider us,
the paying customers, as no more than nuisances.
</P>
<P>
   ``From their perspective, we're trying to bleed them dry with
our incessant questions, complaints and overall whining,'' he
writes. ``So (they) dig their defensive structures, staff them with
people they refer to as being `in the trenches,' and strive to
minimize the cost of engaging with us.''
</P>
<P>
   His prescription: Get real. ``Your customers are already on the
Web talking about you and your products. They're doing so in
natural language. They sound like themselves. And they're making
lots of jokes.'' As he also points out, they're getting resentful,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because Darwin's editors want to show this breakthrough
in the bull wasn't an oversight, they follow up Weinberger with
Jeffrey L. Seglin, writing about corporations' spying on their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, technology is making it easier by the day, he writes, but
is it the best policy? ``It's a simple-enough choice; but because
technology happens to us so quickly, it often blinds us to some of
the pitfalls'' _ mistrust, resentment, lower morale, reduced
productivity _ ``that will follow in its wake.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be better, he says, to hire good people and trust them
function as good people will.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting attitudes such as these, one has to wonder if Darwin
will be able to survive in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One problem with relying on truth and honesty, of course, is
when you don't have the goods to sell. Take, for example, GQ's
cover story on Anna Kournikova, headlined, ``Don't Call Me
Lolita.'' There is extraordinarily little to recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   The article, by Adam Sachs, has an impenetrable beginning, and
before too long, concedes that it has failed in its primary
mission, to enlighten us on this spokesmodel who plays tennis: ``We
cannot know the private desires of Anna Kournikova.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the rankest dishonesty of the piece: The quote on the
cover appears nowhere inside. The whole exercise is merely pale
justification to put Kournikova, looking very Lolita-like, where
she has the best chance to ring up sales.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That pictures of beautiful women will sell men's magazines is
hardly news; both Esquire and Maxim go that route this month, too.
But there are clear differences: Esquire takes a higher road than
GQ, while Maxim, it will come as no surprise, takes the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Its women are lightly clad, and what they do have on is made of
leather. The lead headline _ ``The Be-aooooo-tiful Girls of Coyote
Ugly'' is embarrassingly low brow, and the sub headline is even
worse. It trumpets its ``world exclusive photo shoot'' inside, as
if getting actors on publicity tours to pose for magazine covers is
some sort of coup.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the fuss is warranted, though, for a film that threatens
to do what once seemed impossible, to cheapen the memory of
``Cocktail,'' the Tom Cruise movie that absurdly attempted to make
a bartender's crises compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim does at least offer the charm of no pretense. On the topic
of dishonesty, it dives right in with its ``Complete Guide to
Lying:'' ``The only thing wrong with being untruthful is . . .
getting caught.'' Now there are words to live by.
</P>
<P>
   Esquire, meanwhile, actually succeeds in honoring its cover
girl, Mary Beth Larsen, for more than her looks. Larsen is a
pentathlete and an Olympian, as are several others in the portfolio
of ``America's 10 Sexiest Athletes.'' Yeah, they're lookers, and
there's nothing wrong with that, but they are also achievers. The
essays that accompany each photo are too brief, but are informative
nevertheless. Real substance. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No survey of honesty on the newsstand this month would be
complete with a visit to Boston magazine's ``Best of Boston''
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, almost 45 of the winners were also advertisers, which
surely pointed to the annual series' real agenda. That sort of
ad-driven award-giving is less evident this year, but another one
still thrives.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the listings of the editors' picks for ``best of'' are two
pages of ads crafted to look just like the real thing. A little
later, five more pages are presented in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``On the Town'' event listings, you'll find a series
of paid event listings called ``Coming Up.'' And as you get toward
the restaurant listings, there are the usual ad pages for carry-out
cuisine and for brunch; they have been redesigned since last month,
and look more like the ``best of'' listings than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not paying attention, you might think they're
unsolicited testimonials too. In fact, that's the plan _ marketing
exists to mislead.
</P>
<P>
   Until that changes, the battleground is just as Weinberger
describes in Darwin. It really is us vs. them, and their bombs full
of baloney are no less dangerous, just because everyone does it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the world is not black and white, and even magazines
that might cut a corner or two still offer some gems of writing and
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   GQ has two worth your time: Elizabeth Gilbert writes about her
high-stakes-poker training at the hands of the apparently legendary
woman player, Wendeen Eolis. And the wondrous Walter Mosley
delivers again with his tale of an awkward young man and a woman's
excellent opening line.
</P>
<P>
   In Esquire, read about the ``Lost Souls of Harvard Law'' and see
if you can work up any sympathy for them.
</P>
<P>
   And Maxim? No, nothing worthwhile. But who buys it for the words
anyway?

A GRIM LOOK AT MONEY'S STRANGLEHOLD ON POLITICIANS

THE MONEY MEN 
The Real Story of Fund-raising's Influence on Political Power in
America 
By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum 
Crown, 288 pp., $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Democratic Party officials were planning to celebrate the
bicentennial of the party's founding (ostensibly by Thomas
Jefferson, in 1792), they sought to rally all the party faithful.
So they went to the computer files of the Democratic National
Committee, seeking the names and addresses of the thousands of
party regulars, the ward and town committee members, the precinct
workers and poll watchers, who they assumed were the backbone of
the party.
</P>
<P>
   What they found was a list of donors. Period. The money men were
in. The street workers were out. William B. Greider, who recounted
this story eight years ago, concluded, ``In the age of television,
big money and high-tech candidacies, the `regulars' of party
politics have been rendered irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that voter participation is dismal and getting
worse? Politicians, in catering to their big donors, often show
little regard to taxpayers, consumers, environmental consequences,
or the public interest in general. If voters object, that can be
overcome with a well-targeted _ and well-financed _ ad campaign.
But the voters are not fools. They question why, if their voices
are not going to be heard, they should speak at all.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran journalist Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, currently the Washington
bureau chief for Fortune magazine, is the premier chronicler of
money in American politics. His new book, ``The Money Men,''
describes a blur of political fund-raising that has gone beyond
frenzied competition to become an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   How ridiculous can it get? Birnbaum relates that Republican
elders, responding in 1998 to the plaints of the overly dunned,
established the season pass: for a mere $250,000, givers could buy
plenty of access _ and a guarantee that they wouldn't be solicited
again. ``Unfortunately, money demands being what they are,''
Birnbaum writes, ``the season pass didn't last the whole election
season. The Republican Party broke its promise and went back to
these big givers for more anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum's lively account is bipartisan. President Clinton's
frenzied fund-raising in 1996, and the use of White House visits
and other perks as incentives to give, he says, show that ``the
president . . . was without scruples.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the few reforms that are enacted sometimes produce
consequences that are not only unintended, but perverse. Gift
restrictions Congress has voted on itself mean that lobbyists
cannot pick up the tab for lavish meals the way they used to, but
there are no such restrictions on fund-raisers. The result,
Birnbaum points out, has been a proliferation of intimate
fund-raising dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Money Men'' is thin on fresh reporting of venality. The
few examples of legislation being written or altered specifically
to benefit a contributor are mostly old stories attributed to other
reporters. Birnbaum does provide vivid accounts of one subset of
the problem: ``the shakedown,'' in which lawmakers delay action on
legislation until they wring enough contributions out of interested
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum speaks strongly against the abuses in the current
system, saying soft money ``and its many allied forms of legal
cheating have rendered the entire effort to control and regulate
campaign fund-raising a farce.'' But the remedies he offers are
weak _ limits on lobbyist contributions during sessions, free air
time for candidates, and restrictions on attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   With a shrug, Birnbaum says more fundamental reforms run up
against the valid free-speech rights of the heavy contributors, and
also against societal realities: ``Inequities in the
campaign-finance system reflect the far larger and far more
intractable inequities in society as a whole and can't be
legislated away.''
</P>
<P>
   This view explains the book's major disappointment. In a
democracy, politics is not supposed to reflect inequalities _ it's
supposed to correct them. The electoral system, with its
one-man-one-vote principle, is the great hope of individuals at all
levels to have an equal voice in their government. When big money
washes that hope away, many voters will stay discouraged until they
see reforms more fundamental than those Birnbaum recommends.

CAN THIS PUDDING BE SAVED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some hilarity but still more uncertainty attends the future of
Harvard's Hasty Pudding troupe, famous for handing out
tongue-in-cheek awards (Mamie Eisenhower _ 1953's Woman of the
Year) and dolling up future presidents (Franklin Roosevelt, John
Kennedy) in dresses. The venerable organization, a theater group
and separate social club controlled by an entity known as the Hasty
Pudding Club-Institute of 1770, is on its uppers. Translation: It's
broke.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Pudding has been going broke since at least 1986,
when the club sold the land under the theater to Harvard for back
taxes and agreed to pay rent to the World's Greatest University.
The Pudding, as the old joke goes, has been getting a little behind
in the rent _ $480,000 behind. The university plans to take over
the building Aug. 31, and what happens next is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario is this: The Holyoke Street building,
home to the Up Stairs at the Pudding restaurant as well as the
cross-dressing joyboys, will become a nothingburger Undergraduate
Activities Center that the Pudding would share with other student
groups. Worse yet, under direct WGU control, the Pudding might be
forced to include _ gasp! _ women in its traditionally all-male
cast. Harvard president Neil Rudenstine has blathered about how the
club needs to become more inclusive, blah blah blah.
</P>
<P>
   How did things get this bad? The alumni board that controls the
Pudding feels that Harvard has never properly supported its
world-renowned gang of idiots. (Said idiots have included Alan Jay
Lerner, Erich Segal, and Jack Lemmon, who played piano under the
stage name Jack Orange because he was on academic probation and
banned from extracurricular activities in 1946.) Since 1986, the
board's attempts to mount a capital campaign on behalf of the
theater have been thwarted by Harvard's voracious development
office, which lays first claim to squeezing wealthy alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, some Pudding shows have lost money, and the
financial relationship with the much-praised restaurant has been
stormy. Up Stairs used to host board meetings for free, in lieu of
missed rent payments, one man recalls: ``But we would have had to
eat there about five thousand times to recoup what they owed us.''
``We paid a substantial rent,'' is all co-owner Mary-Catherine
Deibel cares to say on this subject.
</P>
<P>
   Associate Dean David Illingworth promises that the Pudding show
will go on. Harvard plans to spend $6-8 million renovating the
building next year, and then will allow the plays to continue
starting in 2002. ``Since it's a drag show, putting women on the
stage doesn't seem to make any sense,'' he says. The Pudding's
high-living private social club, I suspect, will get the gate.
Neither Harvard nor the restaurant wants to comment on the future
of Up Stairs at the Pudding, but staffers have been telling
customers that they will probably have to move in a year or so.
</P>
<P>
   Free Plug
</P>
<P>
   Thornton Wilder's venerable chestnut ``Our Town'' is not
everyone's cup of tea. It is the perennial nightmare high school
theatrical; since it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1938, it has
supposedly become the most-produced play in the country. Over the
past half-century, every significant critic has had his or her say
about Wilder's spare, ultimately tragic account of life in
``Grover's Corners, New Hampshire,'' a pre-World War I Anytown,
U.S.A. Mary McCarthy liked it; George Jean Nathan hated it. Arthur
Miller complained, justifiably, that the play lacks a psychological
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to imagine the play better rendered than in the
real-life Grover's Corners _ Peterborough, N.H. _ in the current
production by the Peterborough Players. Wilder wrote most of ``Our
Town'' at the nearby MacDowell Colony, and when Stage Manager James
Whitmore (yes, the craggy Miracle Gro pitchman) points over to Mt.
Monadnock, or down to Boston, the effect is electric. I wager that
Whitmore is the best Stage Manager since Henry Fonda defined the
role for a generation of theatergoers in 1969. For obvious reasons,
the Players are hyping the presence of Hollywood veterans Whitmore
and Mary Beth Hurt (Mrs. Webb) in the cast, but the entire
25-person ensemble is superb.

GORE'S CHOICE OF LIEBERMAN WILL COST HIM KEY SWING VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Americans would be hard-pressed to name as many as 20 US
senators.
</P>
<P>
   For those who could, outside of Connecticut, not many would put
Connecticut's Joseph Lieberman on their list of the 20 most
influential senators. Now Lieberman, whose dour and scowling
countenance runs counter to the image of the bright-eyed,
microphone-grabbing pol, is Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   This is the biggest gamble by a Democrat trailing a Republican
since Walter Mondale shuffled the cards, shook up the
establishment, and swung for the fences by tapping Geraldine
Ferraro. That was a desperate ploy, a
what-the-hell-have-we-got-to-lose move as Ronald Reagan cruised to
a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to view Gore's pick as anything but a panicky
reaction to the Republicans' successful convention in Philadelphia,
wherein the vice president was portrayed as a lackey of Bill
Clinton, the man the Bush-Cheney ticket is really running against.
It smacks of Gore's goofy Elian flip-flop. Lieberman, off a Senate
floor speech he made two years ago condemning Clinton's dalliance
with Monica Lewinsky, ``a staff member half his age,'' became Mr.
Rectitudinous that day.
</P>
<P>
   As a moderate Democrat who made morality his business, fussing
about V-chips to screen violence from kiddie television and
muttering threats about cleaning up lyrics in the increasingly
degraded business of pop music, Lieberman has been marketed as
``the anti-Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is not an out-and-out lightweight like Dan Quayle. But
choosing Lieberman over better-known New Englanders like Senator
John Kerry, the Silver Starred Vietnam veteran from Massachusetts,
or George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader from Maine,
is baffling when you consider that Lieberman's relations with labor
unions are no better than cool to lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry would have been my choice. Like Mitchell, he's a Roman
Catholic, a fact not lost upon a 50 million-member slice of
political demographic that comprises crucial swing voting blocs in
the handful of states _ Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Ohio,
Illinois _ whose electoral votes will decide the election. Jewish
voters will be properly delighted. An Orthodox Jew so devout he
refuses to work on the Sabbath, Lieberman's nomination is as
significant to Jews as JFK's victory was for Catholics 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Being the first of your sect to overcome nativist prejudice is a
legitimate political milestone. But some Democrats are aghast,
thinking that Gore's gamble, as this will come to be known, will
cost the ticket the South, period. Gore already had 70 percent of
the Jewish vote, and the bulk of Jewish money, a choice slice of
the Democrats' boodle, when the Hollywood, entertainment, and
development dough is counted. So now Gore gets maybe 10 percent
more of the Jewish vote, which is concentrated in New York (which
Gore was going to win anyway) and south Florida (where Gore was
going to lose anyway, in my opinion), and he faces getting shut out
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   None of us can answer the question: Is America ready for a
Jewish vice president? That really means: Is America ready for a
Jewish president?
</P>
<P>
   What's clear is the 13 states of the Old Confederacy have become
rugged terrain for any national Democrat. Clinton's remarkable
skills and Southern drawl helped him knock off some crucial
electoral blocs below the Mason-Dixon line. I do not know any
politician who thinks a Jewish running mate improves a Democrat's
chances anywhere but around Miami's Jewish retirement nooks.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore runs better in Dade County and risks losing Clinton's
Arkansas, his own home state of Tennessee, and the heavily Catholic
state of Louisiana, which offered some possibilities. Governor
George W. Bush has already nailed down his base in the bulk of the
South, all the mountain states, and a vast stretch of prairie _
Texas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arizona, Kansas, etc. Looking at the
electoral map, Gore has California, New York, Massachusetts, a
handful of other reliably Democratic states, and must concentrate
on a shrinking ice floe running from the Middle Atlantic states to
the Upper Midwest, where Lieberman does little for Roman Catholic
union family Reagan Democrat swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing a little-known senator whose oratical skills and
record in the Senate did not make him an important player in a
dozen years in Washington, Gore seems to be desperately distancing
himself from Clinton, the architect of all that the Democrats have
to run on in economic, foreign, and social policy. Gore thus
repudiates the best weapons in his party's arsenal. He tosses away
his best cards when the other guy, Bush, has more showing on the
table in terms of poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush left Gore some gaping openings post-Philadelphia. For Bush
to blithely renounce the ABM Treaty and vow to build a suspect and
pricey missile defense scheme despite the objections of every other
major power gave Gore the chance to prong the GOP's rookie as
dangerously misguided.
</P>
<P>
   But every time Gore has to explain his Lieberman selection is an
opportunity lost for lambasting Bush as wobbly and unreliable on
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   I'm willing to give Lieberman a chance to prove me wrong. But
till then, my take is that Gore picked the wrong New Englander for
the wrong reason. He felt he needed an ``anti-Clinton'' to beat a
burning Bush whose campaign is afire with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   We went through impeachment; the Senate and the people rejected
it. For Gore now to put Clinton-bashing at the top of his
priorities seems to me not only disloyal but dumb. I hope it works,
for the thought of President George Jr. leaves me green around the
gills. But as of today, I just don't get it. And maybe neither will
Gore's Democratic base.

LIEBERMAN MAY SERVE AS PIVOT FOR GORE'S CAMPAIGN

</P>
<P>
   If in the end Al Gore is elected president, I expect that
analysts will date the turnaround in his campaign to Monday (August
7), when he selected Joseph Lieberman as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush's choice of Dick Cheney, Lieberman is a shrewd pick
because he reinforces what's appealing about Gore _ high
intelligence and sound moral impulses _ while serving as a
corrective to what has been unappealing and ill-judged about the
Gore campaign so far _ its shrillness and populist posturing.
</P>
<P>
   A New Democrat of scholarly mien and an almost serene
temperament, Lieberman may serve as a pivot that allows Gore to
reorient his candidacy in a more promising direction.
</P>
<P>
   My admiration for Lieberman dates from the Senate
campaign-finance hearings that followed the 1996 presidential
election. In general, those proceedings were a festival of partisan
double standards. Republicans such as Don Nickles wanted to talk
only about the sleazy doings of the Democrats. Democrats such as
Robert Torricelli and Carl Levin ignored their own party's abuses
and tried to portray the Republicans as the true villains.
</P>
<P>
   Only the chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, Fred
Thompson, and Lieberman approached the issue in a fair-minded way,
drawing attention to the universality of the chief abuses. Of all
those present, Lieberman paid the closest attention, asked the best
questions of the witnesses, and developed the truest mastery of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   He also displayed his charm and winning wit, as when he starting
giving out ``chutzpah'' awards for the most brazen practices.
</P>
<P>
   I think Lieberman acquitted himself just as admirably in
responding to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The negative rap on
Lieberman is that he tends to be sanctimonious, drawing attention
to his own moral virtue by too readily castigating the failings of
others. It's true that Lieberman's famous Senate speech excoriating
Clinton's misconduct would have been more courageous had he
delivered it earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed cynically, Lieberman's blast was an attempt to distance
himself from the president at the moment when it looked like the
president might not survive. On the other hand, Lieberman was
responding in genuine frustration to Clinton's graceless address to
the nation on Aug. 17, when he admitted that he misled the public
but heaped more blame on his political opponents. There's no real
support for the assumption that the timing of Lieberman's speech
was highly calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the circumstances, though, Lieberman's words were very
much on point. What was unforgivable about Clinton's behavior was
not the fact that he acted immorally but that he put so much at
risk so casually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was personally angry because President Clinton had by his
disgraceful behavior jeopardized his administration's historic
record of accomplishment much of which grew out of the principles
and programs that he and I and many others had worked on together
in the New Democratic movement,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he felt betrayed because he believed in what
Clinton was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was also right about Clinton afterward. His speech
during the Senate's impeachment trial was one of the best, staking
out a convincing, legally precise argument that Clinton's sins fell
short of impeachable offenses. And since then, Lieberman has been
able to move on, focusing on Clinton's strong record at advancing
the goals and issues that Lieberman cares about.
</P>
<P>
   ``This presidency has been the most productive presidency in
more than a generation in the United States of America,'' Lieberman
said, introducing Clinton at an event in June.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has moved on as well. According to various sources, he
encouraged Gore to pick Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Lieberman's is exactly the posture Gore needs to
convey: repugnance at Clinton's sexual morality combined with
support for, and an intention to continue, his successful policies.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the Q &AMP; A.
</P>
<P>
   Objection: Lieberman _ an Orthodox Jew from the Northeast _ is,
as Gore might say, a ``risky'' choice.
</P>
<P>
   Rejoinder: To the contrary. Gore desperately needed to do
something dramatic to shake up his floundering campaign.
Paradoxically, picking a ``safe'' running mate such as John Kerry
would have been the riskier decision because it would have
indicated a continuation of what has been a failing approach. By
picking Lieberman, Gore gets a fresh start, wins praise in the
press, and even scores points for courage.
</P>
<P>
   Objection: Lieberman is no attack dog, which is what running
mates are supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Rejoinder: Yes, but Gore himself is too much of an attack dog.
Paired with someone like Kerry, the ticket would have been all bark
and too much bite. Lieberman tones Gore down, creating something
resembling temperamental parity with the Bush-Cheney ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Objection: Lieberman's ``In Praise of Public Life'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 2000) is a dull, irony-free book.
</P>
<P>
   Rejoinder: It can't touch ``Earth in the Balance'' _ or ``A
Charge To Keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Objection: Anti-Semitism may doom the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Rejoinder: Ed Rendell was probably right when he told reporters,
``I don't think anyone can calculate the effect of having a Jew on
the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll, if you took one, wouldn't yield an accurate answer
because most voters wouldn't admit to any prejudice, even if they
felt it. Realistically, Lieberman's Jewishness is as likely to help
as it is to hurt. If residual anti-Semitism loses votes for the
Democrats, most of those votes will be in Southern states where
Gore isn't favored anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, philo-Semitism may lend material help, not
only in must-win Democratic states such New York and California but
also in swing states such as Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Objection: But can an Orthodox Jew run attack ads on the
Sabbath?
</P>
<P>
   Rejoinder: Apparently so.

&HT;     LEARN SOMETHING FOR THE FUN OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Stands for LEARNING)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometimes the best road to career success is a
blind alley. Workers get so used to learning a few particular
skills for one particular career that they deprive themselves of
the joy of learning. It becomes a chore, not an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   One big regret from a lot of young people who go straight
through college and get a master's degree is that they didn't take
a year off somewhere along the way. By the time you reach college,
it can be a lot easier to focus on the end of the educational
treadmill (or on mass quantities of beer, for that matter) than on
the joy of learning.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Living, Loving &AMP; Learning'' years ago, Leo
Buscaglia recalled how his father, who called him Felice, used to
always ask a question after their Sunday dinners: ``Felice, what
did you learn today?'' Young Buscaglia knew the question was
coming, of course, so he made it a point to look up something in
the encyclopedia before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to tell you a secret,'' Buscaglia writes. ``Even
now, when Felice goes to bed, maybe he's worked 29 hours that day
and he's exhausted, but when he crawls into the sheets, that
gorgeous moment before you go off, he says to himself, `Felice,
what did you learn today?' And if I can't answer that question, I
have to get up and get the encyclopedia and flip to something and
learn something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who love to learn are the ones who succeed, in their
careers and in life. If you have lost that joy and it isn't just a
temporary funk, do whatever you can to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   The best career move I ever made had nothing to do with
journalism. After 10 years or so as a reporter, I was at a plateau.
I still enjoyed newspaper work, but had the itch to explore another
career.
</P>
<P>
   So I tried moonlighting as a financial planner. I went through a
training program and earned licenses to sell things like life
insurance and disability insurance and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't right for me. I liked the idea of helping people with
their money, but financial planners back then made most of their
money through commissions. And I wasn't much of a salesman.
</P>
<P>
   But I learned a lot about personal finance, especially about
focusing on the long term. That training, along with the
availability of information on the Internet, allowed me to bring in
more money during the 1990s as a financial planner than as a
journalist, even though the only people I did any financial
planning for were my wife and me.
</P>
<P>
   I also remember what my boss told me when I quit the financial
planning job: Every job is a sales job. She was right, of course.
Good workers learn how to sell their bosses on particular projects,
and good bosses know that workers will do a better job if they are
convinced that a project is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I sold my newspaper boss on the idea of writing a column
for home computer users. This was in 1989, when computers were far
more frustrating than they are today. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   That got me into writing a regular column, which has become one
of the most rewarding parts of my career. Most of that might not
have happened if I hadn't gotten back into the habit of learning.
</P>
<P>
   I know career gurus preach about building skills _ and you
should _ but that can sound like a huge chore when you're already
feeling overwhelmed by work. Just get started by finding something
you think would be fun, even if it has nothing to do with your
career.
</P>
<P>
   Do you love to travel? Learn more about the history of your
favorite state or country. Even if you feel swamped by work and
life, you might find time for learning by listening to foreign
language tapes while you are commuting.
</P>
<P>
   Read self-help books. Pursue your hobby over the Internet.
Research the details about some unusual factoid you learned from
watching ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   If you look upon learning as a chore, it's easy for inertia to
set in. But if you get into the habit of learning things you want
to learn, it will be easier to add whatever skills that you do need
to survive.

   CIR-HIGHSCHOOL-GADGETS (Undated) _ Rohnert Park, Calif., 60
miles north of San Francisco, is mostly white and middle class, but
it is no Lake Wobegon. At the local high school, most of the
students are academically average. SAT scores hover around 1025,
and the dropout rate is 1.7 percent. Some of the sports teams
shine, while others struggle. The homecoming dance in the fall and
the prom in the spring are the year's two social high points. And
like their counterparts around the country, the 2,000 students at
the school, Rancho Cotate, are no strangers to electronic devices.
That makes it as good a place as any to see what kind of gadgets
the thoroughly modern high school student is using these days. When
the Ranch, as the school is called, reopens this fall, students
will arrive with electronic paraphernalia aplenty, their backpacks
heavy with cell phones, pagers, CD players and custom-burned CDs,
as well as graphing calculators and the occasional Palm organizer
and laptop computer. By Katie Hafner.

   CIR-WEB-RESEARCH (Undated) _ For students who grew up with the
Web, the idea of roaming library stacks to do research is as quaint
as the thought of writing with a quill pen. Even though libraries
are organized and easily navigated, students prefer diving into the
chaotic whirl of the Web to find information. One problem with this
strategy is that many students are not well versed in advanced
searching techniques so a simple search for, say, information about
the planet Saturn can yield tens of thousands of hits. Yet students
persevere with this hit-or-miss approach, saying that they are
simply more comfortable sifting through hyperlinks than they are
flipping through a card catalog. And they admit that using the Web
requires less exertion. But while the keyword approach to searching
makes perfect sense to teenagers, it troubles many educators, who
fear that point-and-click research can lead to lazy study habits
and ineffective searches. By Lori Leibovich.

   CIR-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ The weekly column: When buying a
computer for the college-bound, the most important rule is: ask the
school first. By Peter H. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   CIR-DORMS-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ During back-to-school season 25
years ago, any list of essential items for dormitory rooms usually
featured one piece of equipment at the top: the stereo. Ten years
later, the stereo still ruled, but another appliance was also
considered essential: the answering machine. How 20th century,
college students today might say. The computer, they declare, is
the only item that could possibly deserve to be first on any list
of dorm necessities. In fact, the computer not only displaces other
technology in importance but also replaces the need for some other
appliances. By Lisa Guernsey.
</P>
<P>
   CIR-GEEK-NOTES (Undated) _ Techno news and notes: New palms
emphasize price, power and color; pen-pal online translation; a
laser printer for under $200; women outnumber men online for the
first time.

Windows Internet Explorer favorite sites; legality of trading MP3

believes that software will eventually replace teachers. By Joshua
Green.
</P>
<P>

that students understand articles better when read from a printed

<TEXT>
<P>
   Perusing the Internet the other day, I came across a terrific
recipe site.
</P>
<P>
   It's called www.KitchenLink.com, and it's a great place for
cooks looking for recipes, food news, hunger relief agencies, and
even specialty diet information and recipes. (I discovered the site
when looking for gluten-free recipes for a reader.)
</P>
<P>
   Another solid link on the site is for copy-cat recipes from
restaurants nationwide. Some are from the restaurants themselves;
others have been concocted by home cooks trying to duplicate a
dish.
</P>
<P>
   The first two chili dog recipes were posted by people who said
they knew someone who worked at A&AMP;W years ago, and that's how they
got the recipe. I'm sure that nowadays, the sauce for these dogs is
made at a central factory and shipped to the stores. But if you'd
like to try these at home, here are some decent versions.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the site, I found the recipe for the popular
strawberries Romanoff served at La Madeleine. This recipe came from
a chef at one of the Washington, D.C., outlets of the cafe.

   BLACKS-LIEBERMAN (Washington) _ Despite a flap over remarks by
the Dallas NAACP president criticizing Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
experts say the uneasy relations between African Americans and Jews
in recent years will not depress the turnout among traditionally
Democratic black voters. In recent presidential elections more than
four in five blacks have voted for Democrats. By DAN FREEDMAN and

</P>
<P>
   GOP-DEM-STEAL (Washington) _ It's taking place in broad daylight
with hardly a furtive glance _ the Democratic candidates for the
White House are trying to steal venerable Republican campaign
issues almost as eagerly as their GOP rivals are trying to co-opt
Democratic themes. Both Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W.
Bush are taking a lesson from the master of the campaign co-opt _
Bill Clinton. News analysis. By STEWART M. POWELL.

   HELEN THOMAS (Washington) _ Political conventions tell a lot

   THOMPSON-COLUMN _ One rule of politics is that in times of
soaring prosperity, voters do not defeat the presidential candidate
of the party in power. If that tradition prevails in November, Al
Gore will win. But another rule, which will help George W. Bush, is
that people favor a return to the White House of the party that has
been out of power for a while. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

&HT;     THE EVIL SIDE OF ECSTASY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You have to wonder if a drug called Empathy
could be the toast of young people, a Raver Madness segment on ``60
Minutes'' and a scourge to be fought by politicians and law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   A capsule of Empathy sounds like something Bill Clinton would
take to feel others' pain, but that's the name almost given to
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you heard the story about how it got its name?'' said
Marsha Rosenbaum, the sociologist who first studied Ecstasy in the
late 1980s. She published a book called ``The Pursuit of Ecstasy:
The MDMA Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   MDMA, the official nickname for Ecstasy, is clumsy and the
chemical name it stands for is beyond pronunciation:
3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug was first used in the late '70s primarily by
therapists because it enables people to talk to each other without
defenses and without fear,'' Rosenbaum said. ``People reported they
felt more empathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum said therapists called the drug, which was then legal,
``The Medicine,'' or sometimes ``Adam'' in honor of the therapist
most known for using it. The drug needed a better name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the story goes,'' Rosenbaum said, one of the
distributors of the drug said, ```Well, you know, Empathy would be
the proper name, but let's call it Ecstasy. It'll sell better.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's illegal now, but it's selling better than ever. It sure
does create empathy, as well as increased libido. It's
understandable that young people trying to overcome their defenses
are attracted to the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   This is how hard Ecstasy hits the empathy buttons.
</P>
<P>
   A lesbian acquaintance was undergoing marriage counseling with
the husband she had left for a woman, when their therapist gave
them Ecstasy during a session. So much empathy was created between
them that they got back together, and it took weeks before my
acquaintance remembered she was really a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   I took the stuff, way back during its first wave of popularity
during the early Reagan administration. Look, I lived in Florida,
and it was ``Miami Vice'' time, and Ecstasy was the least of the
vices available.
</P>
<P>
   That sunny Sunday afternoon, my wife and I really, really got
along, but then we made the mistake of turning on the television.
</P>
<P>
   Every show was terrific. I vowed to write a column about how
great television had become. The next Sunday I watched the shows
with a clear head and they all stunk. Ecstasy is not a good drug
for a professional cynic.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how this ``St. Joseph's Baby Acid,'' as professional cynic
P.J. O'Rourke once called it, was so popular in the Reagan era and
once again in the smiley-face Clinton-Gore-Bush era.
</P>
<P>
   If Ecstasy had been the rage in 1968, kids might have made love,
but instead of fighting the war they would have deeply felt for
Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy is potentially harmful to some kids, particularly if
they drink booze with it, get dehydrated from dancing, or get some
more dangerous powder passed off as Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum is head of the San Francisco Office of the Lindesmith
Center-Drug Policy Foundation, funded by drug legalization activist
George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   She would like to see some changes in the ways we approach kids
and drugs, and strictly for the safety of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy can definitely be abused, and not just by kids taking
too much of it, but by politicians making too much of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids read about it, they say, 'Wow, this sounds good,'''
Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one interesting fact. The more you take Ecstasy, the less
it makes you feel ecstatic or empathetic. It's sort of a
self-limiting drug.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Rosenbaum held a two-hour forum on Ecstasy at the
San Francisco Medical Society, and 200 people showed up, many of
them young people. Rosenbaum was so astounded at the turnout that
on Feb. 2, 2001, she plans to sponsor a longer conference called
``Ecstasy, Science and Culture'' to bring scientists together with
ravers.
</P>
<P>
   You want to convince kids not to take Ecstasy? Don't get drug
czar Barry McCaffrey on the case. Just tell the kids that it'll
make them like ``Matlock.''

RESTAURATEUR'S NEW MEXICAN RETREAT INCLUDES A 1,200-SQUARE-FOOT
KITCHEN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BEVERLY BUNDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ The casual visitor would be knocked out by the
vista from the living room _ 50 miles north to Los Alamos, 50 miles
south to Albuquerque _ a panorama of 150 miles of sunset
interrupted by only five blend-into-the-sand adobe structures and
not a single utility wire.
</P>
<P>
   The frescoed walls _ smoother than a debutante's complexion,
with layered shell-thin coats of pigmented plaster _ would also
have their admirers. The six fireplaces, too, would surely elicit
oohs and aahs.
</P>
<P>
   But for a cook, the main event in Mark Miller's New Mexico house
is the 1,200-square-foot kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, owner of the Coyote Cafes in Santa Fe and Las Vegas and
Red Sage in Washington, D.C., knew what he wanted when he designed
his 4,300-square-foot hacienda. He wanted peace, he wanted quiet,
and he wanted a kitchen where he could entertain and work without
the noise, activity and interruptions of his restaurant kitchens.
But he also wanted the functional advantages of professional
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he designed a kitchen that works when he's
developing recipes and menus for his restaurants, yet also reflects
his love of travel, New Mexico and most things Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``In restaurant kitchens, you have to use stainless equipment
because it's the most functional, but I didn't want to see it from
another room; I don't want a demonstration kitchen in my house. The
last thing I want to look at is another kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   To get form and function, he tucked the freezer into an
anteroom. Only one slick side of the professional Traulsen
refrigerator is visible outside of the kitchen. The Montague stove
_ with built-in fry basket and flat frying surface _ hides in
another corner. An in-stove wok, fired by built-in jet flames, sits
flat on the range. His two-grated custom-built grill (''I can cook
a duck on one side and a fish on the other at the same time'') was
built by a local ironworker, based on a drawing Miller made of an
ancient Spanish model. A pizza oven is carved out of one brick
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake by having just gas burners in the stove top;
I should have gone with half gas and half conduction heat,'' Miller
says, noting the benefits of the can't-miss settings of the
cool-heat cooking system.
</P>
<P>
   He has one oven, a convection model, and can't see that any home
cook would need more. A very clever idea is his pastry station: A
small-size refrigerator is housed under one of the marble counters.
Because the top of the refrigerator is cut off, the marble is
always cool and ready for pastry work. The small refrigerator
stores butter, nuts, cream _ ingredients that would pick up odors
in the bigger refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigeration is big in Miller's kitchen _ he figures he has
$15,000 to $20,000 in cooling equipment between the refrigerators,
the ice maker, the wine cooler and the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kitchens don't have enough linear space,'' Miller says.
``Every person working in a kitchen should have a 3-foot-by-18-inch
flat surface to use; ideally, it should be three feet by 24
inches.''
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate people cooking in his kitchen, Miller installed a
19-foot-long, 38-inch-wide island down the center of the room. It's
topped with butcher block, a surface he calls affordable. Inlaid
into one end of the island is a piece of marble _ a ``landing
zone'' for hot items coming off of the stove or out of the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was designed to fit into a modular system holding the
standard full- and half-sheet trays that are de rigueur in
restaurant kitchens. The trays can slide into the freezer, be
transferred and slid into the refrigerator brackets, and taken from
there directly to the oven.
</P>
<P>
   A man of distinct tastes (''I always stay in Hyatts because I
can't stand those fake antiques in the Ritz Carltons''), Miller is
exacting in his own home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anything higher than eye level is wasted. You forget
about it if you don't see it. And I don't like cabinets for the
same reason.''
</P>
<P>
   To store the necessities of cooking and serving, Miller built
two walk-in pantries lined with open shelves. One pantry is filled
with plates and ceramic pieces. It's an eclectic collection,
including such pieces as Villeroy &AMP; Boch Petite Fleur vegetable
bowl and an old tinware fish poacher. The second is filled with
ingredients: One shelf holds dried mushrooms and chiles, another
holds oils and vinegars, a third displays Asian chile pastes and
spices.
</P>
<P>
   He found another solution for wineglasses, storing them in
glass-fronted olive-wood cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to see things; you can easily break a $100
Baccarat champagne glass by dragging it out of a cabinet,'' Miller
says.
</P>
<P>
   But his kitchen is not all about function.
</P>
<P>
   The walls are a shade called ``carmelita,'' not quite oxblood,
not quite burgundy. Miller has loved the color since first seeing
it in Spain, where it is often used in monasteries. Another exotic
touch is the pink dome, inlaid with glass discs, that rises from
the ceiling _ an idea taken from Morocco's public baths. Middle
Eastern-inspired designs frame the kitchen's doorways.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gravity of Miller's purposeful design, he has one
piece of advice for home cooks designing their own kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make the kitchen an area where you'd like to play. If you
don't like the kitchen, cooking will be drudgery.''

   ANDES-RETREAT (Undated) _ Friends are envious when they hear
that my wife, Rynn, and I have built a family retreat in the
Ecuadorian Andes, with two mature orange trees in the yard and
flocks of parrots flying by. The house is located in an un-Provence
called Zona de Intag, a rural county that tends more toward fried
yucca than white truffle omelets. We call it a weekend house
because it takes three days to travel there by plane, bus, horse
and foot from New York. The final leg is a muddy path that meanders
past sugar cane fields and clusters of orchids until it reaches our
house, where we live in the style of the 19th century, without
electricity or plumbing other than a garden hose connected to a
sink. By Stephen P. Williams.

 &HT;    Read all about how to land a role as a real-life movie extra
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Wanna be in pictures? You're in the
right place. It looks like Palm Beach County has become Hollywood
East.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Palm Beachers watched Sigourney Weaver, Gene Hackman
and Jennifer Love Hewitt film scenes for ``The Breakers,'' an
upcoming big-budget release from MGM Studios. This month, a young,
scrappy crew in Jupiter is filming ``Do You Wanna Know a Secret?,''
an independently produced horror thriller aimed at teens.
</P>
<P>
   But while studios are making movies in our back yard, breaking
into the biz is still tough. One place to start is by being an
``extra.'' You know, those nameless, dialogue-less folks who
provide background and atmosphere for film scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Moviemakers need extras. They believe extras add ``legitimacy''
to a movie. Think about it: How authentic would a film set in New
York City be without crowds crawling along the sidewalks?
</P>
<P>
   When a movie is filmed on location, the extras are usually local
residents. And, in the case of ``Do You Wanna Know a Secret?,''
that's where you come in.
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Breakers'' did some extras casting, it uttered a call
for the rich and sockless. Now, the producers of ``Secret?'' are
looking for folks to help film scenes at a beach and at a rave
club. This is your chance to get dressed in your sexiest duds and
be in the motion picture business.
</P>
<P>
   To help you land the role, we slipped on our shades, spiked up
our hair, grabbed a mocha latte and visited the set in search of
tips. Executive producer Del Tenney's Jupiter home _ where the
majority of the movie is being filmed _ has been overtaken by the
cast and crew. Power cables lie everywhere. The words ``Do You
Wanna Know A SECRET?'' are spray-painted on a bay window.
</P>
<P>
   We chatted with the movie's producers and some of its stars
about being an extra. We met Joey Lawrence, former Blossom TV star,
now a strapping 24-year-old fresh from the set of his last movie,
``Urban Legends: Final Cut'' (it'll be out next month). We had a
few minutes with Jack McGee _ a ruddy-faced character actor
audiences love to hate (he was the surly cops reporter in ``The
Paper,'' and the skeptical Sgt. Jordan in the recent remake of
``The Out-Of-Towners''). We also talked with Tom J. Jones. This is
his first feature-length movie, but he's been in several
commercials (nowadays it's a 1-800-COLLECT ad, starring alongside
Alyssa Milano. ``I'm the guy on the phone,'' Jones says).
</P>
<P>
   Cool. Even cooler: These guys offered inside information on
getting the extras gig ... and keeping it once you're on set.
You'll also hear from producer Kermit Christman, who is going to be
selecting the extras. Christman _ who founded the Palm Beach
Shakespeare Festival 10 years ago _ will tell you what the
filmmakers are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for some free advice? Then quiet on the set!
</P>
<P>
   Reality check
</P>
<P>
   Before we go any further, let's check some misconceptions at the
door. Being an extra can be hard work. It's not glamorous. You're
not going to get your own trailer. You're not going to have a
six-hour work day. In the case of ``Do You Wanna Know a Secret?,''
you're not even going to get paid. You will, however, score some
free meals, and your name will be tossed into a raffle to win
either $500 or a water scooter.
</P>
<P>
   This is a typical day in the life of an extra: Get to the set,
wait around, take direction. The crew will film a scene a few
times. Then you wait around some more. Take more direction. Film.
Wait. Film. Wait. Film. Wait.
</P>
<P>
   Get the idea? Days in the movie business are long. Everyone _
including extras _ will put in 12 hours, probably more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment to do this means you will be there for many
hours,'' Christman explains. ``Motion pictures are not made
swiftly. It's `Hurry up and wait.' ... We need people with patience
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Long hours and no pay? OK, so it's not a career, but you do get
to be in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   And how do you get in? In the case of Secret, Christman is
looking for people ages 18 to 24 to participate in a ``beach''
scene and a ``rave'' scene. Show up at Palm Beach Community
College's Eissey Theatre in Palm Beach Gardens. Auditions for the
rave scene will be at 5 p.m. today; casting for the beach scene
will be at 5 p.m. on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Say you fall into that 18-to-24 demographic. Don't think age
is the only thing Christman's looking for. He has his eyes peeled
for upbeat people with a sense of style. The extras in Secret?
should be spunky, a little funky ... and beautiful. When you come
to the audition, be dressed in attire for the scene. Shiny club
clothes would help for the rave scenes. Women couldn't go wrong
with bikinis for the beach scene.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't try too hard, Christman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is, be yourself. The movie is about
people like you,'' he says. ``So if you're going to great lengths,
you're going to be preparing to not be `you.' Understand? Just be
yourself. How do you dress to go to the beach on a sunny day? How
do you look when you go to a nightclub? ... That's how you should
look when you come do this.''
</P>
<P>
   And come prepared for potential disappointment. Although the
movie's script calls for about 200 to 300 extras, Secret's
producers will have to turn some folks away. Still, it might be
worth a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just come down and try out,'' says Jason Goldman, assistant to
the producer. ``Almost every (actor) starts at the ground floor.
... Obviously, we're not guaranteeing that you'll be a movie star.
But if you want to pursue that, here's a great first opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the part
</P>
<P>
   OK, suspend your disbelief for a moment: You've scored a role as
an extra in ``Secret?,'' and now you need some ``survival tips.''
We got 'em, straight from the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you need to understand is that the cast and crew
are there to make a movie. It's a big deal to them _ literally
every minute costs them money. That said, here are some things to
remember, so you don't end up on the cutting room floor:
</P>
<P>
   Do what you're told: ``Like any job, just pay attention and do
what they ask you to do,'' says executive producer Tenney. ``If you
try to be outstanding, you are going to be a problem. This is all a
team effort. It's like any other job out there; it's teamwork, and
you have to do your job when it's time to do your job. It's that
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look at the camera: ``Your natural tendency is to gawk
right into the camera,'' says character actor McGee. ``What you
have to do is be conscious that the camera's there, but act as if
it isn't. If you're in a dance scene, there's nothing wrong with
turning away from the camera. Swinging back, turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, you're an actor: ``The director just wants
you to be yourself and act natural,'' says young actor Jones _ who
was an extra in the movie ``Waterworld.'' ``Acting is pretending
that you're not pretending. In this case, if you're at a club,
you're at a club. If you're talking to your friends, talk to your
friends. Laugh, dance, do whatever. But that's what they want,
because they want to create the ambiance that this is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the long hours: ``As glamorous as this racket is, it's
a long, tedious day,'' admits McGee. ``When they need you to come
to set, they need you. Don't dilly-dally around. It's not easy to
do. ... You're probably going to make friends while you're there,
you'll get to know people and maybe want to goof around a little
bit. But be serious about it. Be serious, but have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything: ``When they say `Cut,' you gotta cut,''
says lead star Lawrence. ``You have to be like soldiers; that's
kind of what it's like. You'll be given directions as a whole body
of people _ and like a choir, you have to sing on cue. You have to
nail your parts. And you have to be that tight about it, because we
don't have time to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Be on time: Ellen Jacoby, the extras casting director for ``The
Breakers,'' offered this observation: ``Never, ever approach the
stars. Never ask for autographs. Never take pictures. And get there
a few minutes early. If there are 500 extras and you show up 10
minutes late and say, `Oh! The traffic was terrible!', I'll say,
`499 other people got here on time. I'm here on time.' We'll ask
you to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Yikes! In the end, just remember this extras bit is a lot of
work, but a lot of fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone loves the movies. We just love it,'' Christman says.
``Why? I think we love the magic of it. We go to the cinema in the
dark and we see this lightshow in front of us, that tells a story.
That really is it. ... And now, here it is, in your own back yard.
Be a part of it. Enjoy it.''

SUCCOTASH GOES GOURMET _ SUFFERIN' IS HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sylvester the cat uttered his trademark, ``Sufferin'
succotash,'' I always thought he must have eaten in the same school
cafeteria that I did.
</P>
<P>
   Succotash creates a bad image for me. I remember the pale-yellow
corn and the uneasy green lima beans swimming in a watery cream.
Not only was it unappetizing, but it ruined the food resting next
to it.
</P>
<P>
   The succotash juices spilled over the tomato sauce and onto the
meatloaf, causing a sort of sick pink backdrop for the entire meal.
</P>
<P>
   The name itself _ succotash _ has a curious sound to it.
Succotash is promoted as a summer dish, a simple recipe for fresh
summer corn, but its history is more or less linked to
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional explanation is that succotash comes from the
Narragansett Indian ``misickquatash,'' a term for boiled corn. That
doesn't look or sound like succotash to me, but I guess it's close
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The dish has come to refer to a combination of corn and beans,
and the Pilgrims and Indians are believed to have eaten that very
combination when they established the American Thanksgiving holiday
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   That was the feast held in 1620 for the Indians by the newly
arrived English settlers to celebrate their hopes for peace after
the first harvest in the Plymouth Colony.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe it was in 1621, and the party was really thrown by the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   One account says that the first Thanksgiving celebration is
believed to have taken place in Plymouth, Mass., in 1621. In the
late fall, the Wampanoag Indians traditionally held a harvest
festival to give thanks for the food they had grown; in England,
the Puritans had observed a solemn thanksgiving in November as part
of their religious practice.
</P>
<P>
   In the autumn of 1620, the Pilgrims did land in Massachusetts,
but there wasn't much to celebrate. Many accounts of the time say
several people fell ill or perished that winter. In spring 1621,
two Wompanoag Indians, Squanto and Samoset, found the survivors.
Squanto stayed with the Pilgrims through the summer and taught them
about native foods and how to grow them.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, the harvest was bountiful, and the Pilgrims had
enough food for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. William Bradford declared a day of thanksgiving, and Capt.
Miles Standish invited Squanto, Samoset and their leaders to join
the celebration. So many Wampanoags showed up, the food supply was
strained, and the Indians had to bring their own covered dishes.
That could have been when green-bean casserole was invented.
</P>
<P>
   There probably weren't any pies or cakes, because no flour was
available. Some blasphemous people say there wasn't even a turkey.
The best-guess menu is fowl of some kind, deer, and cranberry
sauce. Along with corn soup, white fish, maple-sugar candies,
cornstarch candy, wild plums, watercress, beans, squash and boiled
pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   And succotash.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder relations became strained.
</P>
<P>
   Today, things have changed. Succotash has busted out of its
traditional role of sloppy cafeteria food, and the list of
ingredients has grown.
</P>
<P>
   Purple onions, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers have added
additional flavors to the old beans and corn. Succotash has even
made its way into high-tone magazines.
</P>
<P>
   This month's ``Gourmet'' offers a spicy version that uses cider
vinegar and jalapenos for extra zing.
</P>
<P>
   It's no longer ``sufferin' succotash.''

&HT;     FORD RENEWS CHALLENGE OVER USE OF `MODEL E'

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Its case thrown out by a Detroit judge for
lack of jurisdiction, Ford Motor Co. has refiled a lawsuit against
an Internet startup company called Model E.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker contends that the name Model E would create
consumer confusion about whether Model E's business was associated
with Ford's antique vehicles, most notably the Model T, said Ford
spokeswoman Kathleen Vokes.
</P>
<P>
   The Fremont-based Model E plans to offer customers
built-to-order vehicles sold over the Internet. Clients also will
be able to subscribe to various cars over specified time periods,
an option similar to leasing but the deal would include
registration, maintenance and other services.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker maintains the Internet company has violated a Ford
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're protecting a trademark,'' Vokes said. ``What was ruled
on was not necessarily the validity of the case. It was the
validity of the jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan court's decision, made Monday, was in response to a
motion filed by Model E on Aug. 3 to dismiss Ford's lawsuit, which
had been filed July 28. Ford refiled the case in the U.S. District
Court in Oakland after the Detroit court said it did not have
jurisdiction over the case.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford never produced a ``Model E'' car, it did sell a
truck under that name. And the company is using the name for its
program to provide computers to all its employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the dismissal of the Ford suit against us in Michigan, we
were hoping to rededicate ourselves and resources to those that
matter most to us _ our customers,'' said George Kim, Model E's
chief business development officer.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said the company has made it clear to Ford it would like to
discuss a resolution. ``Obviously, we do not want to spend our
precious time and resources on this matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our use of the Model E name does not violate
any rights of Ford,'' said William Santana Li, Model E's president
and chief executive. ``In fact, Ford has known of our company since
last year and never told us of any concern until just recently.''

</P>
<P>
   CIR-HIGHSCHOOL-GADGETS (Undated) _ Rohnert Park, Calif., 60
miles north of San Francisco, is mostly white and middle class, but
it is no Lake Wobegon. At the local high school, most of the
students are academically average. SAT scores hover around 1025,
and the dropout rate is 1.7 percent. Some of the sports teams
shine, while others struggle. The homecoming dance in the fall and
the prom in the spring are the year's two social high points. And
like their counterparts around the country, the 2,000 students at
the school, Rancho Cotate, are no strangers to electronic devices.
That makes it as good a place as any to see what kind of gadgets
the thoroughly modern high school student is using these days. When
the Ranch, as the school is called, reopens this fall, students
will arrive with electronic paraphernalia aplenty, their backpacks
heavy with cell phones, pagers, CD players and custom-burned CDs,
as well as graphing calculators and the occasional Palm organizer
and laptop computer. By Katie Hafner.

   CIR-WEB-RESEARCH (Undated) _ For students who grew up with the
Web, the idea of roaming library stacks to do research is as quaint
as the thought of writing with a quill pen. Even though libraries
are organized and easily navigated, students prefer diving into the
chaotic whirl of the Web to find information. One problem with this
strategy is that many students are not well versed in advanced
searching techniques so a simple search for, say, information about
the planet Saturn can yield tens of thousands of hits. Yet students
persevere with this hit-or-miss approach, saying that they are
simply more comfortable sifting through hyperlinks than they are
flipping through a card catalog. And they admit that using the Web
requires less exertion. But while the keyword approach to searching
makes perfect sense to teenagers, it troubles many educators, who
fear that point-and-click research can lead to lazy study habits
and ineffective searches. By Lori Leibovich.

considered essential: the answering machine. How 20th century,
college students today might say. The computer, they declare, is
the only item that could possibly deserve to be first on any list
of dorm necessities. In fact, the computer not only displaces other
technology in importance but also replaces the need for some other
appliances. By Lisa Guernsey.

A MONSTROUS PREFIX IS STALKING EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Aug. 13.)  
 (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hottest combining form in populist suspicion of science was
coined in a letter to The New York Times on June 2, 1992, from Paul
Lewis, professor of English at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on an Op-Ed column criticizing the Food and Drug
Administration's decision to exempt genetically engineered crops
from case-by-case review, Professor Lewis held, ``Ever since Mary
Shelley's baron rolled his improved human flesh out of the lab,
scientists have been bringing such good things to life.'' After
this reference to Dr. Victor Frankenstein, who created the monster
in Shelley's 1818 novel, the academic letter writer shot a bolt of
juice into the lifeless coinage dodge with ``If they want to sell
us  &UR; Frankenfood &LR; , perhaps it's time to gather the villagers, light
some torches and head to the castle.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what they did! ``Genetic engineering'' was not then a
scary enough phrase. The science of making foods more productive or
resistant to disease had noncontroversial roots in hybrid corn
pioneered in 1923, but ethical concerns about cloning merged with
worries about mad-cow disease and suited the promotion of
``organic'' foods. A frightening metaphor was needed, and the
 &UR; Franken- &LR;  prefix did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe reporter wrote in 1992 that  &UR; Frankenfood &LR; 
``summed up nicely the monstrous unnaturalness of such
controversial new products as genetically enhanced tomatoes and
chromosome-tinkered cows,'' and quoted the delighted Lewis, today
chairman of the English department, saying: ``It has a phonetic
rhythm, it's pithy and you can use the  &UR; Franken- &LR;  prefix on
anything:  &UR; Frankenfruit &LR; . ...  &UR; Frankenair &LR; . ...  &UR; Frankenwater &LR; .
It's a  &UR; Frankenworld &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, biotechnophobes and other members of the antigenetic
movement have denounced  &UR; Frankenseeds &LR; ,  &UR; Frankenveggies &LR; ,
 &UR; Frankenfish &LR; ,  &UR; Frankenpigs &LR;  and  &UR; Frankenchicken &LR; , lumping them
together as fearsome  &UR; Frankenscience &LR; . In The Chicago Tribune,
David Greising wrote in 1999 of  &UR; Frankenfarmers &LR;  supported by
 &UR; Frankenfans &LR;  arguing with  &UR; Frankenprotesters &LR;  about unfounded
 &UR; Frankenfears &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, there's no telling when or how it will end. It has
enhanced the sales of the metaphysical novel that Shelley's
husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, encouraged her to write,
and has not harmed sales at ``Frank'n'Stein,'' the fast-food chain
whose hot dogs and beer I find delectably inorganic.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Dialect Society, Laurence Horn says: ``I was
hoping somebody might have coined  &UR; Frankensense &LR;  by now. This would
be sort of the opposite of common sense, maybe as a description of
politicians' motivations for a creatively stupid piece of
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   But this play on  &UR; frankincense &LR; , an aromatic gum resin used in
religious ceremonies, has not caught on. ``Alas,'' says the
dialectologist Horn, ``all the Web site usages I can find for
 &UR; Frankensense &LR;  seem to be unintended misspellings of the
traditional Christmas gift. You can tell because there's an equally
orthographically challenged rendering of  &UR; myrrh &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   No Sentence Fragments
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the GOP chairman, sent out a release under a
header encapsulating his party's message for the current campaign:
``Renewing America's Purpose. Together.''
</P>
<P>
   This raises the issue of sentence fragments. Slogans _ from the
Gaelic  &UR; sluagh- &LR;  (army)  &UR; gairm &LR;  (yell), or ``battle cry'' _ need
not be complete sentences. A Republican slogan in the 1928 campaign
was ``Hoover and Happiness, or Smith and Soup Houses,'' which
contained no verb. (The Democratic response four years later, ``In
Hoover We Trusted, Now We Are Busted,'' was a comma splice of two
complete sentences and helped elect FDR.) Some facetious slogans of
the '70s were sentences (``Support Mental Health or I'll Kill
You'') and some were not (``Dog Litter _ An Issue You Can't
Sidestep'').
</P>
<P>
   I have long rallied to battle cries containing verbs. ``Keep
Cool With Coolidge'' strikes me as more forceful than ``Rum,
Romanism and Rebellion,'' the ill-chosen phrase that sank James
Blaine's campaign against Grover Cleveland, though both phrases
were alliterative gems. ``Vote as You Shot,'' with its two verbs,
stirred Ulysses Grant's followers, while ``Elect a Leader Not a
Lover'' savaged Nelson Rockefeller, and ``Make Love Not War'' signs
danced at demonstrations in the 1960s. All these were short
sentences studded with the action of verbs and not passive sentence
fragments.
</P>
<P>
   What is a sentence fragment? A decade ago, I collected a bunch
of ``fumblerules'' that demonstrated the errors they intended to
correct. These ranged from ``Don't Use No Double Negatives'' to
``Avoid Clichs Like the Plague,'' and included ``No Sentence
Fragments.'' I confidently passed along the conventional
pop-grammarian wisdom that a sentence should contain a complete
thought and thus required a verb.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast (as sentence-fragmenters say). James McCawley, the
late linguistics master at the University of Chicago, took issue
with my knee-jerk pedagogy. First, he noted that a sentence should
 &UR; express &LR; , rather than  &UR; be &LR; , a complete thought. This was no
nit-pick; the example he gave was the answer to ``What did he
buy?'' ``A hatrack.'' McCawley wrote that `` &UR; A hatrack &LR;  expresses
exactly the same thought as  &UR; He bought a hatrack &LR;  and hence doesn't
express any less complete a thought: The difference between the
full sentence and the sentence fragment is not in the completeness
of the thought expressed but in the completeness of the form in
which it is expressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, McCawley instructed me that ``for something that
occupies the position of a sentence to be a `sentence fragment,' it
is  &UR; not &LR;  necessary that it  &UR; not &LR;  contain a verb.'' The fragment of
an expressed thought _ not a complete sentence _ can indeed contain
a verb: Lincoln's anguished ``And the war came'' is an example.
</P>
<P>
   Seized of the great grammarian's clarifying subtlety, and
willing after 10 years to rethink my pronouncement (and allowing
for sloganeering license), I cannot now denounce the current
Republican slogan as blatantly incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   That slogan _ ``Renewing America's Purpose. Together.'' _ may be
choppy prose and less than catchy or rousing. And putting
``together'' at the end, freestanding, rather than at the beginning
as ``Together Renewing America's Purpose,'' seems to make the unity
pitch appear to be an afterthought. But the two expressed thoughts
cannot be easily denounced as an offense to good grammar. Just
awkward.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Constructing a simple fence, in a straight line on relatively
level ground without a gate, is within the skill level of an
intermediate do-it-yourselfer. The hardest part is making an
accurate layout, estimating the needed materials and setting the
posts.
</P>
<P>
   First check with community building officials to see if the
local codes affect your project. Many codes require that the
''good'' side of the fence project away from the house. Codes often
have restrictions on height and how far the fence must be from the
property line, the setback.
</P>
<P>
   Also check with utility companies to find the location of all
underground pipes and cables. Many companies will come to your
property and mark the locations for you. When you dig the post
holes, stay at least 18 inches from these marks. It is also a good
idea to notify your neighbors that you plan to erect a fence. This
simple precaution can ease a lot of tensions before they have a
chance to fester.
</P>
<P>
   When you are ready to plan the fence, put in stakes and string
to mark its position. The line should be at least six inches within
your property line. Be certain you know exactly where your boundary
lines are. If you are not sure, hire a surveyor to mark the lines
before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   After you have determined the length of the fence, map out the
sections. Each will be supported at the ends with a post. Fence
posts should not be farther apart than eight feet from center to
center. To find the total number of posts needed, divide the total
length of the fence by eight. If you come up with a remainder,
divide again by a slightly smaller number. By adjusting the number
through trial and error, you will eventually come up with a whole
number. To that number, add one (for an end post), and that will be
the number of posts needed. Return to the string line and mark the
location of the posts with stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Each section will be made up of three elements: The posts, the
stringers and the pickets. Make a scale drawing of a section, and
use it as a guide to help estimate the amount of lumber needed for
the entire fence.
</P>
<P>
   You have already determined how many posts are needed, but you
need to figure their length. The posts will be made of 4-by-4
stock. The length will be determined by the height of the post plus
enough extra stock to set the posts in the soil. Minimum setting
depth is 32 inches. Assume that your fence will be 6 feet high. Add
32 inches to that and you will arrive at fence posts about 8 1/2
feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Two stringer boards are required for each section. The stringers
are the horizontal boards that support the pickets. Use
two-by-fours for the stringers. They will be four inches shorter
(to allow for the width of the posts) than the section length.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you need to calculate the amount of lumber needed for
the pickets. The total number of pickets will be determined by the
dimensions of the fence and by its design. First, decide the width
of the pickets. Next determine how much space you want between
them. You can, if you desire, butt the pickets together so there is
no space. This will create a fence that will give you plenty of
privacy, but it will also block the breezes.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to space the pickets out, consider the picket
width and space as an individual unit. Divide that number into the
section length. You may have to adjust either the picket width or
spaces to arrive at a whole number. Multiply this figure by the
number of sections to find the total number of pickets.
</P>
<P>
   Next, determine the length of the pickets. This is really a
design choice. There are only two factors to consider. The pickets
should be at least one inch off the ground and they should not be
higher than the posts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the lumber, you will also need rust-resist nails
made of aluminum or stainless steel, or nails with a galvanized
coating. If you decide to set the fence posts in cement (you can
use ordinary dirt but the posts will not be as sturdy), you will
need about two 80-pound bags per post.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to order this material is from a lumberyard that
sells fencing materials. The dealer can check your estimates and
the yard will have a stock of ready-cut fence parts in a variety of
woods. Pine is the cheapest wood, but requires periodic
maintenance. Cedar and redwood are maintenance-free but more
expensive. Next week, this column will describe the technique for
building the fence.

   NEW YORK _ You ready for the show? Because the set is waiting
for you. The office door of Philip Marlowe, Private Detective, is
on one side; the office of Sam Spade, Criminal Investigator, is on
the other, and in the center, befitting the star, is the name of
Raoul Felder, in gold. Trompe l'oeil, the doors of Marlowe and
Spade, though Europeans have been known to get confused.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a cheap gag _ we are talking office space on the
30th floor on Madison Avenue _ but Felder, matrimonial lawyer to
the stars, is doing well. We could let him discuss the art in his
office, the Groz, the Picasso; or permit him his old trick of
beguiling the adversary into a sense of superiority with a
self-deprecating comment regarding his accomplishments or health.
(Today's: ``You have allergies? My sinuses are killing me.'')
</P>
<P>
   But because this is Felder, gallantly looking out for the rights
of single mothers in the case of the Brazilian lingerie model
Luciana Morad vs. Mick Jagger (``The wrinkly rocker, I called him.
That's a nice phrase.'') by seeking $35,000 a month in child
support, let's cut to the chase.
</P>
<P>
   Felder, you've got a lot of rich, spoiled people for clients _
``Yeah,'' interrupts Felder, agreeably. ``They usually go together,
by the way, those two adjectives. I had very little choice in my
career. A Jewish boy growing up in Brooklyn, it was doctor, lawyer
or, if you weren't so bright, selling shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   But you didn't have to do this kind of law.
</P>
<P>
   Deadpan, which Felder does as well as his pal Jackie Mason:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. It was the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Now playing, in one of the longest-running shows in town, our
own matrimonial song and dance man, Raoul Felder. How old are you
getting to be, Felder? ``Sixty-three. That's a lie,'' he says,
trimming three years.
</P>
<P>
   The National Law Journal called him a ``publicity machine
extraordinaire,'' and some say his wife and partner, Myrna Felder,
is the superior legal tactician. But Felder's friend and frequent
adversary, Eleanor Alter, calls him ``terrific at what he does, who
knows how to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   And, given his public relations philosophy _ ``I knew and still
know how to use the media'' _ he will rarely show offense.
</P>
<P>
   Felder, you seem very often to get the fiscal have-nots. Mick
Jagger's girlfriend and not Mick. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Men, particularly wealthy men, usually have regular lawyers.
The women go with a name they see in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   So you don't feel bad that Mick didn't call?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. When you represent men _ I don't like to mention names,
but I represented Brian De Palma and Richard Harris years ago, when
they were big stars _ they come in with a gang of their sycophants,
they're used to ordering people around. They have these guys:
`Yeah, baby. Go, baby. Great idea, baby.' The wife starts out
tabula rasa, she listens to the lawyer. Do you come with a troop of
retainers when you go to any other professional? You go to a
doctor, you don't take a press agent.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible there is some genuine melancholy here. Growing up
poor in Brooklyn, Felder had an elder brother who had been sent to
the country to escape an epidemic of infantile paralysis and there
contracted polio, an event which could instill in anyone an
appreciation of the dark ironies of life. That brother, the
legendary songwriter Doc Pomus, who died in 1991, wrote the hits
``This Magic Moment'' and ``Save the Last Dance for Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Felder begins legal life as a federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   How does he become a divorce lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a boring story,'' Felder says. ``Thankfully it's short.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll make it even shorter. Felder represents a pal in a
divorce, and The Daily News writes it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year I made $50,000,'' he says. ``I'd been making
$11,000 a year in the prosecutor's office. It was a great way to
make money. It's not a religious endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling with the allergies. ``I'm passing away. I got to take
a spray up my nose. I'll show you the bottle, I want you to know
it's not crack cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   A brief adjournment, after which Felder is asked about a framed
front page from a British tabloid, about a consultation with Diana,
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment,'' Felder honks. ``I get consulted by a lot of
people, make a lot of enemies. One enemy I made for no reason at
all was the poor kid that got killed in the plane crash, John
Kennedy, when the rapist was being tried. Remember his cousin
William Kennedy Smith, he was a rapist, tried in Florida?''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Felder continues speaking about the trial, undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a statement, `This could turn out to be the fall of the
house of Kennedy.' After the rapist was acquitted I get flowers
like you send for a dead person and a note that says, `We're still
standing, baby,' and signed `John.' I didn't quite believe it. I
called one of the columnists and said, `You check it out,' and it
was him, the flowers were charged to Kennedy's account.''
</P>
<P>
   Felder did not need to send that to the papers. He could have
checked it all out himself.
</P>
<P>
   A look innocent of any ulterior motive, which you might believe,
if you had been declared brain dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I call, maybe I could con them out of it if I wanted to
spend the time. If a newspaper calls up they can get it easier.''
</P>

 &HT;    Routine maintenance is a must to keep windows in good shape
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - My house has aluminum siding that's in decent
shape, so I don't have to paint the exterior walls. But that
doesn't mean I escape entirely; owners of brick-, aluminum- and
vinyl-covered houses still need to attend to window frames.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your windows have wood, vinyl or aluminum frames,
routine maintenance will help keep them working well.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional wooden windows, when properly maintained, are
good-looking and functional, and they can be good insulators when
used in pairs to create a dead air space in-between.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden windows, though, are vulnerable to water damage and must
be protected with paint or some other surface sealant. Inspect
windows inside and out at least once a year to check for
deterioration or mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   The claylike glazing used to hold glass in the frame should be
supple and moist. Dried, cracked glazing should be removed and
replaced. Deteriorated glazing can allow moisture to enter the
window frame.
</P>
<P>
   Check the paint on frames outside the house. If the paint is
cracked or peeling or if pigment comes off when you rub a finger
over the surface, the window should be repainted.
</P>
<P>
   Wash the surface with a rag or a soft-bristled brush and a
cleaning agent such as TSP (trisodium phosphate), which can be
found in most home-improvement and paint stores. Rinse with clean
water and allow the surface to dry completely.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape off any remaining loose paint and sand the rough edges
with medium-grit sandpaper. If your sanding has exposed any bare
wood, you'll need to prime the surface with an oil-based primer.
</P>
<P>
   Use a good-quality acrylic-latex exterior trim paint to repaint
the frame.
</P>
<P>
   A common problem with inside wooden window frames is that they
are sometimes painted shut. A film of paint between the sash, the
part of the window that goes up and down, and its track locks the
window in place.
</P>
<P>
   To correct that situation, cut through the paint film along the
sash with a utility knife or a paint zipper, a specialty tool found
in paint and hardware stores. Move a block of wood along both edges
of the sash and tap it lightly with a hammer to break the seal.
</P>
<P>
   Remember both the top and bottom sashes should be able to move,
so you should unseal both.
</P>
<P>
   If the windows stick just a little, check the inside of the
track where the sashes move. Sometimes scraping away any stray
paint you find in the track will help. Wrapping sandpaper around a
small block and using it to smooth the inside of the track can be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   If the window is warped, you might have to remove and reposition
the stop, the strip of wood that forms the front border of the
window's track.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the window operating smoothly, occasionally rub a little
candle wax in the track.
</P>
<P>
   Nonwooden windows aren't as vulnerable to water as wooden
windows, but they do accumulate dirt and must be kept clean and
lubricated.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the sashes can be removed by depressing the butmake
them more airtight. The type of weatherstripping varies with the
type of window you have, but remember that felt and pliable rubber
usually last longer than foam rubber, and metal usually lasts
longer than plastic.
</P>
<P>
   While you're working on your windows, assess their security. Are
the latches sturdy and in proper working order? How easy would it
be to force open your sliding windows?
</P>
<P>
   Consider key locks for windows easily accessible from the
ground. You might even want to think about security bars. Remember
that if you install security bars on your windows, you won't be
able to use the windows to escape in a fire or other emergency
unless the security bars can be opened from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   To improve the security of a wooden, double-hung window, add a
simple pin lock. With the window closed and locked, drill a pilot
hole at a slight downward angle through the top of the front sash
into the bottom of the back sash. Slip a metal pin _ a hefty nail
or scr

WHAT GENS X AND WHY WANT IN A PRESIDENT

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  FALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   As today's politicians discuss the future of America at the
Republican and Democratic presidential conventions, they probably
should wonder what the future of America thinks of them. The good
news is that while Xers and Boomers may have written off the
political process, today's teens are taking a downright
pro-government stance.
</P>
<P>
   My company, Youth Intelligence, recently surveyed 300
trendsetters (young people who we know to be bellwethers for the
rest of the teen population) and 750 nationally representative
14-30 year-olds. We found that only 4 percent considered the state
of politics to be the biggest issue facing their generation. Drugs,
violence and education topped the list.
</P>
<P>
   And according to a CBS study of the class of 2000 due to be
published this year, 91 percent of graduating seniors believe the
government has a positive impact on the country and on their lives
compared with only 80 percent of the class of '97. In the same
study, 41 percent said they can trust the government most of the
time and 52 percent said some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   So what changed? Well, don't expect the Class of 2000 to be out
on the hustings with buttons and banners. Although they are indeed
more optimistic, they are hardly naive. Today's teens have lived
through political scandal and potential impeachment, but they have
also enjoyed a great economy, a welcoming labor market and little
conflict. And how can they fault a president's infidelities when
they may have experienced the same in their own lives?
</P>
<P>
   As one 15-year-old in Austin, Texas explained, ``Hey,
politicians are humans, right? Of course they are screwed up. I
feel sorry for my parents because I think they thought that
politicians were like gods or something. The way I look at it, I
just want a guy who will keep the country in good shape and not get
us blown up.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be why, among the nationally representative 14-30
year-olds we surveyed, Bill Clinton topped a list of public figures
that ``are just really cool.'' (He was beaten only by Michael
Jordan). As one 16-year-old in Detroit said, ``The way I see it, if
that guy can get out of the mess he was in with (Monica), you know
he'll be able to keep us out of any war.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may well be that this time of economic prosperity has
significantly affected young people's outlook. More than 40 percent
of the 300 trendsetters we surveyed in April think the economy will
improve over the next year, and as long as that stands, they don't
seem too concerned about who occupies the chair in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   But what may also be driving these teens' pro-government
mind-set may be an underlying cry for stability. Today's teens
don't want to rebel against the government. Instead, they want the
government to offer some safety and security in a world that often
seems to be spinning out of control. As one 14-year-old in Los
Angeles explained, ``I guess I want to believe they know what
they're doing. I mean sometimes the world is just nuts and you've
gotta believe that someone's in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be this hope that influences their presidential choices.
In our April survey, respondents were split down the middle over
whether they would prefer Al Gore or George Bush. But no matter who
they chose, the themes were the same:they expected their candidate
would help regain control and make sure nothing truly bad happened.
Our respondents did not seem to be voting on issues so much as hope
and confidence that their guy wouldn't screw up.
</P>
<P>
   Young people seem to want a hero who can help right some of the
wrongs we continue to face. Yet they realize heroes are not
flawless. Teens know that a good politician might make an awful
husband. That's OK, so long as he keeps the country out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is this teen generation may not be looking for
presidential timber only in the traditional places. In the CBS
poll, 65 percent of students surveyed stated that the United States
is ready for a woman president, while in 1999 only 48 percent of
all adults in the United States would have agreed. Although no
question was asked about a non-Caucasian candidate, my guess is the
answers would have been similar.
</P>
<P>
   As you watch this election and as politicians start planning for
2004, remember that by then, many of these teens will be able to
vote.

WITH ROOTS IN 19TH CENTURY, CIRCUS IS STILL THE `GREATEST SHOW ON
EARTH'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By WAYNE LEE GAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Was P.T. Barnum talking about the popularity of the
circus that bears his name when he said, ``There's a sucker born
every minute?'' Or is there another reason _ a rite of passage,
perhaps _ that explains why year after year, in cities across
America, parents and grandparents lead wide-eyed children to
arenas, convention centers and big tops to watch a form of
entertainment that might be considered passe?
</P>
<P>
   The circus, with its roots in the late 19th century, flourishes
even as society _ with all its bells and whistles _ prepares for a
new millennium. Crowds still get goose bumps watching the high-wire
acts, the daring young men and women on the flying trapeze, the
parade of elephants, the animal trainers, and don't forget the
clowns.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that the more things change in this world of
high-tech show business, the more the circus stands apart and
retains its unique appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll survive, because of the same reasons it has in the
past,'' says Joe McKennon, a circus historian in a telephone
interview. ``Circus acts don't work anyplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   The most famous circus of all, of course, is the Ringling Bros.
and Barnum &AMP; Bailey show. Its popularity still transcends
generations and its audience is still composed largely of families.
They've come to see the self-proclaimed ``Greatest Show on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tykes may nod off in the arms of their parents or be more
interested in their cotton candy as the night wears on, but
audiences still marvel at acts they've seen over and over before.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen elephants kneel and march in unison; horses dance and
kitty-cats perform wire acts with birds. A confident animal trainer
beams at the crowd while directing tigers by the cage-load; poodles
jump through hoops and over hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget the human element. The exuberant audience
encourages a trapeze artist who misses four attempts to connect
with his fellow artist and falls unceremoniously into a net before
he finally succeeds. Imagine the reception for Troy Aikman if he
threw four interceptions in a game?
</P>
<P>
   But there are subtle signs that the circus is evolving, too. A
female animal trainer belts out a Broadway-style song, accompanied
by the live combo that has replaced the traditional calliope; the
ringmaster mixes a little of yesterday and today _ singing songs
and also introducing acts with oldtime bravado: ``Never before
performed on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when scores of independent circuses
crisscrossed the country, stopping in small towns as well as big
cities. In small backwater places, the circus had a special appeal,
appearing quite glamorous and adventurous to people who earned a
living in a labor-intensive agrarian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its golden age, when the circus came to town, all the
businesses closed, the schools closed,'' says New Jersey-based
social commentator and circus historian Ernest Albrecht.''It was
the one day when you could see that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaudeville has disappeared, replaced by television and the
pop-rock entertainment acts. The exploits of semi-pro teams became
less attractive to fans enticed by the mega-bucks major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But the circus survived, making its rounds of the country,
finding a niche in the post-industrial, market-driven economy.
There are a number of touring and permanent circuses, although Feld
Entertainment, the owners and presenters of the Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey touring show, Disney on Ice and Siegfried and Roy,
dominates the circus industry, with an average revenue flow in the
neighborhood of half a billion dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   Two equally large units of the Ringling Bros. circus _ each
transported from city to city in a mile-long train _ tour the
country for 45-48 weeks every year, visiting approximately 90
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Although the circus remains economically viable, its survival in
America is strengthened by the unflinching loyalty of the
performers.
</P>
<P>
   The circus has ``always been my life,'' says Catherine
Hanneford, a 31-year-old animal trainer who also sings and acts as
a master of ceremonies at the pre-show, interactive sessions.
Hannefords have been in the circus since the 17th century in
England. Catherine's parents have retired from touring and operate
the non-touring Hanneford Family Circus in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>

nn
</P>
<P>
   Catherine is married to a circus performer _ Hungarian-born
acrobat Aklos Feher. She was discovered by the Feld organization
while performing at the Hanneford circus, and returns to work there
during the few off-weeks enjoyed by the Ringling Bros. show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circus is a family tradition,'' says Hanneford, who envisions
continuing success for the art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not staying in the past,'' she says, pointing out its
relevance in the age of family values. ``The circus is the last
place left to take children for live entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, a person almost had to be born into a circus family
to work there; nowadays, outsiders enter the profession via
organized training programs. Mark David, who is 39, a lean,
athletic 5 feet 11 inches tall and 145 pounds, grew up in Baraboo,
Wis., one of the traditional winter quarters for the circus. Thus,
he was close to circus families from childhood. David, who is the
son of a gymnast, started studying the art of trapeze when he was 8
and began performing professionally at 13 with a smaller touring
circus. His act _ which features him hanging upside-down by his
heels from a swing _ dates back 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   As with other circus acts, David's is not without the occasional
injury.
</P>
<P>
   And like with any athletic career, injuries, as well as age, can
take a toll and determine a performer's longevity. ``There's always
an element of danger,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   David's worst injury has been a broken finger, but he says a
close friend was killed while performing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other career options ``never entered my mind,'' he says.
``For sure I couldn't be in an office.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the early days of the circus, the high-wire acts and
trapeze artists are working with nets. Still, for animal trainers
and daredevils such as J.P. Theron, the element of danger remains
very real. Theron, 44, is billed as ``the human comet.'' He wears a
skin-tight costume that is set on fire before he dives 42 feet into
a large, inflated mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Theron is married to a former aerial artist who is wardrobe
mistress for the circus. They have two children. He has worked at
circus jobs ranging from clown to rigger before a slight weight
gain (he is still a trim 195 pounds on a 6-feet-2-inch frame)
forced him to abandon an aerial act he had developed. Theron also
was born into a circus family and made his debut when he was 4
years old as a last-minute replacement for a short adult who wore a
clown costume.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard the audience roaring in laughter, I was hooked,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the potential for disaster that is built into his act,
Theron smiles and acknowledges that this is part of the appeal of
the circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to see an accident,'' he says. ``But nobody wants
to miss one, either.''
</P>
<P>
   But while audiences may accept the chances humans take,
historian Albrecht sees a looming challenge on the horizon for the
circus from the animal rights movement. The circus has come under
frequent attack for keeping animals in captivity and training them
for difficult, unnatural stunts.
</P>
<P>
   The circus industry is taking activists seriously. The Feld
public-relations campaign includes press kits explaining and
vigorously defending the company's treatment and use of animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circus people will have to decide whether to face that sort of
thing, or, as Cirque du Soleil has done, to tour without animals,''
Albrecht says, referring to the upscale, adult-targeted
Montreal-based touring organization that has been one of the
surprising success stories of the entertainment industry in the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition of animal-rights activists, plus the growing
expense and difficulty of transporting animals, may lead more
circuses to tour without animals. But would that eventually signal
the beginning of the end of the circus as generations of Americans
have come to know it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else can you see 15 elephants?'' Mark David says.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the circus were to disappear tomorrow, it would leave
its imprint on society. From phrases such as ``three-ring circus''
to describe any complicated, confusing scenario, to the common
recurrence of clowns as a dream symbol, to references in
literature, music and the fine arts, the circus is eternal. Italian
filmmaker Federico Fellini, American composer Charles Ives _ and
even the shy poet Emily Dickinson _ were fascinated by the color,
and sometimes the dark underside of the circus; volumes have been
written on the underlying meaning of the circus and its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Dickinson summed it up best, in fourteen poetic words:
``Friday I tasted life. It was a vast morsel. A circus passed the
house.''

   Subterranean Attacks
</P>
<P>
   Q. The autumn before last I planted about 50 English bluebells
(Hyacinthoides non-scripta) and 25 crocuses on our wooded property
in Massachusetts. A few of the bluebells came up and none of the
crocuses. Last autumn I planted 200 bluebells and 50 daffodils. The
daffodils came up, but not the bluebells. It is very discouraging;
I would very much like to have a bluebell woods. I suspect rodent
damage. Is there a solution?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, to be in England, where having a bluebell woods is easy,
once you have the woods, and where the delicate, fragrant H.
non-scripta is the bluebell you get to have.
</P>
<P>
   Taller and scentless, but otherwise similar, Spanish bluebells
(H. hispanica) are more common in the United States. Though both
species are widely sold in this country, anecdotal evidence
suggests the Spanish ones are more likely to thrive. Cold winters
and hot summers both discourage the British from colonizing.
</P>
<P>
   But it sounds as though yours never had a chance to get
discouraged. The soil might be too wet; most bulbs need good
drainage. Alternatively, as you suspect, something may be eating
them. If so, the something is probably voles, which adore crocuses
and are impossible to get rid of on a woods-wide scale.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to find out what's wrong and what to do about it is
to conduct a simple study.
</P>
<P>
   Plant some of each species three ways: Without protection, and
also protected from voles by the two methods discussed below. Plant
them four or five inches deep, the groups close enough so that
they're growing in more or less the same soil. Be sure to make
above-ground labels.
</P>
<P>
   Protection method 1: Coat the bulbs with an animal repellant
like Ro-Pel or Deer-Off. (Wearing rubber gloves, put them in a
bucket and get them thoroughly covered; let dry before planting,
and wear the gloves for that, too.) These repellents work well, but
only in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Method 2: Plant each bulb surrounded on all sides by a bunch of
tooth-defying gravel. A gravel vole barrier doesn't work as well as
repellants, but it lasts several years.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, make note of what comes up. If it's nothing at all,
your problem is probably the soil. If you get bluebells, notice
which group or groups they belong to and plant accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz Busters
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are the battery-operated mosquito repellent gadgets
effective? The ads say they work by emitting sounds made by
mosquitoes' enemies, but I don't know if I believe it.
</P>
<P>
   A. Numerous scientific studies have failed to find any use for
these things, and extensive nonscientific field tests have also
been performed by my husband, an avid fisherman who frequents
mosquito-infested places. Our conclusion: The only thing they repel
are human beings driven mad by their high-pitched whine.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective protection is provided by Deet
(N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), the active ingredient in most
chemical-based repellants. It is usually harmless if used as
directed but it can be hazardous, especially to children, and
particularly if overused.
</P>
<P>
   Deet is absorbed through the skin, so one way to avoid problems
is to put it on your clothes instead. Choose an outfit for
gardening: Shirt, pants, socks, hat or kerchief and gloves. Spray
lightly with a product that contains a high concentration of Deet
and let dry before donning. Store in a plastic bag between
wearings.
</P>
<P>
   A thorough exploration of mosquitoes and how to repel them,
originally published in Annals of Internal Medicine, is available
at www.acponline.org/annals/01june98/mosquito.htm.

went too far last week in threatening to say just what he thought
of his successor, Bill Clinton, ``as a human being and a person,''
if Clinton persisted with personalized attacks on his son. ``I made
a mistake,'' Bush told Time magazine. The former president's threat
raised eyebrows on two counts. Not only would any attack on Clinton
breach the convention that former presidents do not attack
incumbent presidents; it also sent the message that George W. Bush
was a ``Daddy's boy,'' incapable of fighting his own battles....By

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rohnert Park, Calif., 60 miles north of San Francisco, is mostly
white and middle class, but it is no Lake Wobegon. At the local
high school, most of the students are academically average. SAT
scores hover around 1025, and the dropout rate is low. Some of the
sports teams shine, while others struggle. The homecoming dance in
the fall and the prom in the spring are the year's two social high
points.
</P>
<P>
   And like their counterparts around the country, the 2,000
students at the school, Rancho Cotate, are no strangers to
electronic devices. That makes it as good a place as any to see
what kind of gadgets the thoroughly modern high school student is
using these days.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ranch, as the school is called, reopens this fall,
students will arrive with electronic paraphernalia aplenty, their
backpacks heavy with cell phones, pagers, CD players and
custom-burned CDs, as well as graphing calculators and the
occasional Palm organizer and laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The gadgetry falls into two categories. First, there are the
learning aids. Those include graphing calculators for science and
math, electronic translators for foreign language classes and
electronic spelling checkers and synonym dictionaries for English
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers like at least some of the gadgets, while others
are skeptical, but they do not prohibit them.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Moses, a 44-year-old Spanish teacher, for instance, is of
two minds about the pocket translators she sees scattered among her
students.
</P>
<P>
   Moses said she often saw students type in a word and get
translations that were literally correct, yet wrong for the
context. When she had students write about what they did during
their spring vacation last year, out came the translators.
</P>
<P>
   When the students looked for Spanish words to describe their
spring break, Moses said, ``they found a word for `break your
leg.''' She added, ``Then they looked up `spring,' and it didn't
help them with that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses said she considered the translators a gimmick, hardly
worth the $50 _or even $100 _ the students spend on each one.
Instead, she recommends a good Spanish dictionary and a strong
understanding of idiomatic usage. ``They don't know that they've
been ripped off,'' she said, ``and they'll defend using the
translators.''
</P>
<P>
   By way of rejoinder, Moses said, she offers her students
examples of how the misuse of a word can end up making the speaker
look silly. ``The last thing high school kids want is to look
stupid in front of their peers when it's not on purpose,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Graphing calculators, which can run small computer programs and
draw the graph represented by a complex equation in an instant,
continue to find their way into classrooms, and teachers at the
Ranch are mixed in their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Utter, 48, a math teacher who has taught at the school
for 17 years, generally encourages the use of graphing calculators
because of the power they put into the students' hands.
</P>
<P>
   But Drew Kempiak, 28, a science teacher, isn't so convinced of
their utility. Often, he said, students have no idea how to use
many of their calculators' features.
</P>
<P>
   A typical conversation with a student, Kempiak said, goes as
follows:
</P>
<P>
   Kempiak, pointing to a ``1 divided by X'' button: ``What does
this button do?''
</P>
<P>
   Student: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempiak: ``Why do you have this calculator, then?''
</P>
<P>
   Student: ``It's what my mom told me to get.''
</P>
<P>
   John Vogt, 42, a biology teacher, said he did not allow students
to use calculators at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure the kids know how to do some of these
calculations by themselves first,'' he said. ``Believe it or not,
there are high school kids who don't know how to do simple things
like convert decimals to fractions.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Graphing calculators often do double duty as game machines, and
students can be wily when it comes to using them to play. Vogt said
he could spot a student using a calculator for a game. ``I can tell
when they're using them to do math because I see them punching in
their data,'' he said. ``But if I just see them pushing buttons, I
know they're playing a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The diversions offered by other devices are less easily
disguised. They fall squarely into the other category of electronic
devices: extracurricular.
</P>
<P>
   No class hour would be complete without the distraction of cell
phones and pagers. Teachers at the Ranch say more students are
carrying cell phones, although pagers are still the most common
communications device. By some teachers' estimates, one student in
three carries a pager, and one in seven has a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Both types of devices are officially banned at the school, in
accordance with California's education code. But teachers and
administrators at the Ranch have long since given up on enforcing
the ban, and some have even found the cell phones useful.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette Tucker, 33, who teaches English and journalism, said
the phone in her classroom broke four months ago. When her
journalism classes met, she said, the students needed a phone to
get information for their articles. ``We used the kids' cell phones
to make calls,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Tucker said, cell phone use may be getting out
of hand. She was appalled when she saw seniors calling one another
during the most recent graduation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it because it's cool,'' she said. ``You can talk to
your friend 50 feet away even if you're not sitting next to him or
her. I was aghast at the disrespect that indicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Utter said her students were not very good at hiding their
pagers. ``You'd think the kids would be smart enough to put them on
vibrate,'' she said. ``And if it does vibrate, they have to check
it, and the moment they do, everyone wants to know who it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of pagers and cell phones has taught Utter and
her colleagues to be suspicious of requests to go to the bathroom.
``Nine times out of 10 they're not going to the bathroom _ they
just want to make a phone call,'' she said. ``I tell them straight
out, `I'm not that stupid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vogt is stricter still. Pagers and cell phones that go off in
his class are confiscated immediately, and parents have to reclaim
them in person. ``I guess I'm just a stickler for the rules,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents, of course, want their children to carry cell
phones or pagers so they can stay in touch or reach their children
in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   But entertainment is the only reason to have the popular Sony
Discman, and it is everywhere at the Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   CD players, still far more prevalent than MP3 players, are the
subject of frequent discussions by concerned teachers and staff
members at the school. In general, said Mary Lee Higgins, an
assistant principal, disc players are not allowed in classrooms but
can be used at lunch or after school.
</P>
<P>
   Utter said she did not allow CD players in her classroom under
any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more lenient. ``If I'm done lecturing and presenting
information, and they're studying or doing practice work,'' Kempiak
said, ``I let them listen to their music because at that point it's
their time. My policy is, if it does not disrupt me or any of the
students in the class, then it's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing the rules can require constant vigilance. Utter said
sweatshirt hoods must stay off heads at all times just in case the
clothing is covering earphones. ``Then again,'' she added, ``those
little ear buds are pretty easy to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is not easily defeated. The tip-off, she said, is the
volume. ``They're not too bright,'' she said. ``They get it wired
up through their shirts and up to their ears, then they play it too
loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempiak said he kept his eye on students' pockets. ``If they
fidget with their pocket,'' he said, ``it means they're speeding up
to go to another song, or they might be changing radio stations.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempiak said several of his students not only burned their own
audio CD's but also made their own game CD's. Occasionally, he
said, if a good student is finished with classwork and asks to use
the class computer to play a game, he allows it _ as long as the
game is relatively benign.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity in conduct standards has sown some animosity among
the teachers. ``There's a giant spread,'' Kempiak said. ``There are
teachers who don't want to enforce rules, period, all the way to
teachers who would like a guard tower and barbed wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, laser pointers were the preferred gadget among
pranksters. ``It's the new spitball,'' Kempiak said. ``While the
teacher has his back turned, you put a little red dot on him.''
Vogt likened it to the once popular practice of using small mirrors
to reflect the sun into people's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   During the last school year, Kempiak said, a student in his
freshman physical science class directed a laser pointer through
several panes of glass and into the eyes of a teacher in a
classroom in an adjacent building. A laser can pose a safety risk
if it is shined directly into the eye. The student was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   That incident, coupled with a fad that had students putting a
variety of covers on the tips of the pointers so they could project
sexually suggestive shapes, led to a ban on the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Walkie-talkies were just beginning to catch on at the Ranch last
year when a group of students tuned in to conversations between
staff members using walkie-talkies. Students' use of walkie-talkies
was banned soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Handheld organizers, like Palms or Visors, are still largely the
domain of high school students who are more affluent than most of
those who attend Rancho Cotate High, yet a few teachers interviewed
said they were beginning to see these organizers showing up in
class. The Palm is popular among students because of its wireless
e-mail functions. Less expensive devices that can send messages
across a cafeteria are more for the middle school crowd, Utter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Students in Utter's classes still pass handwritten notes. ``Pen
and pencil is not a technology we'll lose,'' she said.

THE CAMPUS' NEW BMOC (`M' IS FOR MACHINE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During back-to-school season 25 years ago, any list of essential
items for dormitory rooms usually featured one piece of equipment
at the top: the stereo. Ten years later, the stereo still ruled,
but another appliance was also considered essential: the answering
machine.
</P>
<P>
   How 20th century, college students today might say.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, they declare, is the only item that could possibly
deserve to be first on any list of dorm necessities. In fact, the
computer not only displaces other technology in importance but also
replaces the need for some other appliances.
</P>
<P>
   It serves as the stereo for students who listen to MP3 files and
radio Webcasts. It makes answering machines less necessary because
so much communication occurs via e-mail and instant messages. It
even can substitute for televisions and alarm clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The computer has also become the portal through which students
do everything they need to do on campus. Using the Internet, they
register for classes, turn in assignments, order books, browse the
library catalog, listen to music, talk to friends, read the news,
write papers, play games, pay bills, watch movies and carry on
heated political discussions. Alumni returning to their alma maters
will find that the quads and classrooms still exist, but the
computer has become almost more central than the physical campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an invisible change,'' said Matthew Pittinsky,
co-chairman and founder of Blackboard, a software company that
serves more than 3,300 colleges. ``But it is probably the most
profound change that colleges have seen since the G.I. Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer's immense impact on the social and academic lives
of college students is just beginning to become apparent. Some
students say they are carrying on fewer conversations with their
dorm mates and more conversations with friends across the country.
Many students say that while they still hit the bars and coffee
shops, they rarely go to the library. One study shows that students
spend less free time watching television, now that they can be
entertained online.
</P>
<P>
   As students pivot toward online information, ``something clearly
has to give,'' said Eric Weil, managing partner in Student Monitor,
a market research company that polls college students. In the
latest Student Monitor survey, conducted in the spring, 56 percent
of the 1,200 respondents at colleges across the country said that
they had spent less time watching TV in the previous six months.
</P>
<P>
   What were they doing instead? About 42 percent said they were
spending more time surfing the Web and 49 percent said they were
spending more time sending and receiving e-mail. Academics played a
role too: Fifty-seven percent said they were spending more time
doing homework. In many cases, Weil said, that homework was
probably being done on a computer, often online.
</P>
<P>
   But some students say that it is not television that they
neglect. Instead, they are spending less time on the telephone or
talking face-to-face with their peers on campus. It is not that
they are being antisocial, the students say. They are simply
communicating with people in a different way, using e-mail, online
chats and streams of instant messages.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Kelson, a junior at Syracuse University, said he frequently
chatted online with his parents, his sister, his grandmother in
Florida and his friends at other colleges. ``It helps because
calling is expensive,'' Kelson said. ``And e-mail is good but it is
not as personal.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends often watch television while they chat, he
said. And more often than not, he said, he is chatting with people
in his dormitory, even though they may be only a few paces away.
Instead of picking up the telephone or knocking on his neighbors'
doors to see what they are up to, he will send them an instant
message.
</P>
<P>
   Kelson's case is not unusual, said Bennett Fisher, vice
president for community at CollegeClub.com, a social site for
students that has attracted nearly 3 million users. ``We used to
sit in the hallway and talk to students in the dorm,'' Fisher said.
``Now they do that on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Even conversations with professors, those moments of stimulating
intellectual discussion that some baby boomers may recall with
nostalgia, are often supplanted by online communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office hours are being replaced with e-mail discussions,''
said Gary Gigliotti, director of the Center for Teaching Excellence
at Rutgers University. Some regret the loss, but instead of waiting
for that one hour a week when professors open their doors, students
would rather talk online, Gigliotti said. ``It is more convenient
for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of this shift were planted in the early 1980s, when
technologically adept students started bringing computers to
campus. But back then, the machines were by no means essential.
They were primarily used for typing papers, and most students chose
to rely on the word-processing programs in computer laboratories
instead of buying their own machines. Computer science and
statistics students were often the only ones to use computers for
more than writing papers.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, when the Internet caught on beyond the halls
of engineering and computer science departments, that started to
change. Large universities began to invest tens of millions of
dollars in wiring dormitory rooms in the hope of providing
high-speed Internet access to every student. It was the beginning
of the race to provide what administrators call ``one port per
pillow.'' On average, campuses have wired about 63 percent of their
dormitories, according to the Campus Computing Project, an annual
survey of more than 500 institutions across the country. Private
research universities have gone the furthest: Of those surveyed,
all said they offered high-speed access in every dorm.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The availability of Internet access has become a deciding factor
for students who are trying to decide where to apply to college.
Yahoo Internet Life magazine produces an annual ranking, ``The 100
Most Wired Colleges.'' EduCause, a nonprofit organization that
promotes technology in higher education, has created an online
guide to help applicants determine which universities measure up to
their needs (www.educause.edu/consumerguide).
</P>
<P>
   Last spring in a sign of how important Internet access has
become, students at Michigan State University, where all but some
dormitories are wired, lined up seven hours in advance to make sure
they were assigned to wired housing. To help those who missed out,
the college installed voice mail. Everyone in those dorms uses the
telephone lines for dialup access, said James L. Carey, a
sophomore, ``and students would be online so much they would never
get phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest challenges facing administrators is whether to
require all entering students to bring a computer to college, and
whether it should be a laptop or desktop. Reports on the Educause
Web site show that about 100 universities have such a requirement,
which in some cases is imposed only on students in certain
programs. Next fall, the number will probably increase: About 11
percent of the institutions surveyed by the Campus Computing
Project last fall said they would have a laptop computer
requirement in place by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio University has decided to tackle the issue another way: It
has equipped every undergraduate dorm room with at least one new
$1,000 Gateway computer and printer. The cost of the equipment is
covered in an annual student fee.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much time do students spend on these machines?
Reports of time spent on the Internet alone show that students have
been increasing the number of hours they spend on their computers
each week. In the fall of 1998, according to Student Monitor,
students spent an average of 5.6 hours a week online. That rose to
7.2 hours in the fall of 1999 and 8.1 hours this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But many students say those numbers are even higher among
students with computers in dorms that have high-speed access to the
Internet. Shaun Encinias, a student at San Diego State University,
said he spent hours online each day, checking e-mail before leaving
his room in the morning, between classes, after classes and after
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail, though, is not necessarily the most important reason for
going online, according to the students polled by Student Monitor.
More than 44 percent said that ``schoolwork-related research'' was
their No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   Most courses now have an Internet component, professors say,
whether it is a Web-based syllabus, an e-mail-based discussion
board, an online repository of required reading or an interactive
quiz. Some instructors set up online chats with experts and
colleagues at other universities across the country. And many
students use the Internet and online library resources to do most,
if not all, their research for papers and projects. When they are
done, many send their papers via e-mail or click through Web pages
during presentations in class.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the computer can sway some students away from
academics, however. Carey, the sophomore at Michigan State, said he
failed all his classes his first semester. ``I was shellshocked,''
he said. ``I stayed in my room all the time.'' He would log on to
the Internet as soon as he woke up and hung out with friends he had
made online instead of doing homework or talking with friends on
campus. This year, he said, he is doing much better and uses his
computer mainly for homework.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has allowed students to reach beyond their campus
in ways they could not before, said Rick Thompson, director of
IBM's personal systems group. But, he warned, it can also lead to
more isolation. If you choose to interact online with people who
are just down the hall, for example, you are missing the chance to
see their facial expressions, how they look when they are joking,
what their body language tells you about their personality.
</P>
<P>
   Kaycee Swenson, a high school senior in Wichita, Kan., who took
several courses at her local college last year, said she talked to
people online everyday, most of whom were not at her campus. But
she said she also hung out with friends in the physical world,
listening to music and playing basketball. ``You have to balance
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, she will enroll full-time at the University of
California at San Diego, and she plans to take a new computer with
her, even though she already has one equipped with a Pentium II
processor. ``It's fast,'' she said, ``but not fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, when she talks to her mother about what she
brought to college decades ago, she cannot believe what students
had to put up with. ``She thought it was great,'' Swenson said,
``that she was able to take a calculator to college or a cassette
player to tape lectures.'' And when her mother said she had to
stand in line to register for classes and to wait for professors to
open their offices, she said she could hardly imagine it. ``I laugh
at those things,'' Swenson said, ``but I'm sure it wasn't fun, you
know?''

SITES HONOR WOMEN PIONEERS IN AVIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleanor Roosevelt called them ``a weapon waiting to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry H. Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forces, who had said
they served ``no military purpose,'' changed his mind after Pearl
Harbor and in 1944 told them: ``You can fly wingtip to wingtip with
your brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   They were the more than 1,000 women who flew warplanes in World
War II, and it was not until long after the war that the country
realized that these women, like those who went to work in the
factories, were leading a revolution, not serving as an
``auxiliary'' of anything.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when women pilot planes on aircraft carriers, it is easy
to forget how little time has passed since women who flew were
called aviatrixes. The Web is a good place to learn about these
pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no survey would be complete without Amelia Earhart,
the second person to fly the Atlantic solo after Charles Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   At www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq3-1.htm, the Naval Historical
Center has a Frequently Asked Questions page with a biography and a
bibliography of Earhart, who was lost over the Pacific in 1937
while trying to fly around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting Earhart site is one by the FBI,
whose Electronic Reading Room posts declassified FBI documents on
many celebrated cases. The pages on Earhart
(foia.fbi.gov/earhart.htm) offer a look at the letters sent to the
bureau insisting that the writers had picked up radio messages or
had been told about her by their Japanese captors.
</P>
<P>
   The letters are less persuasive as evidence than as a
demonstration of the emotional appeal of Earhart's daring, which
influenced many female pilots who followed.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, WASP on the Web (www.wasp-wwii.org/) has the story
of the 1,074 Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War II (of more
than 25,000 who applied), who quit their jobs, went to Texas and
passed the rigorous training to earn their wings. They were hired
to ferry military planes in the United States, freeing male pilots
to fly them overseas and in combat.
</P>
<P>
   The founder and director of WASP, Jacqueline Cochran, who became
the first woman to break the sound barrier, is well represented on
the site and its links. The group was created in 1943 in a merger
of Cochran's unit, the Women's Pilot Training Program, and the
Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron, led by Nancy Harkness Love. (A
biography of Love, reprinted from Aviation History magazine, is on
the site.)
</P>
<P>
   The site is full of memorabilia and respect. There are audio and
video clips, World War II posters, diaries and photos that recalled
the West Texas dust, the rattlesnakes and the two-holers. Women
received the same training as men, except for some combat-related
flying, and few extra comforts.
</P>
<P>
   For teachers, the site has an interactive chat room that can set
up student interviews with a WASP. There is a timeline and a
display of uniforms and wings, some designed and paid for by
Cochran, which were based in part on the shield of Athena, the
Greek goddess of wisdom and warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The site is maintained by Nancy Parrish, the daughter of a WASP
and director of Wings Across America, a nonprofit group at Baylor
University in Waco, Texas, that is raising money to collect oral
histories from the 600 surviving WASP members, and to create an
interactive virtual museum. ``We want to give every single WASP a
chance to tell her story,'' Parrish said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Yeager, the first person to break the sound barrier, is
quoted on the site: ``They flew war-weary aircraft to repair
depots; they instructed male pilots and flew military aircraft on
navigational training flights. The WASP performed routine testing
of military aircraft, flew administrative missions, towed targets
for live gunnery practice, and, in total, flew every type mission
except combat.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the war, the female pilots had delivered nearly
13,000 aircraft. Thirty-eight women had been killed. But because
they had been hired as civilians, the women who were killed
received no gold stars or military honors.
</P>
<P>
   Their bodies were brought home at the expense of friends and
relatives. The intention to make the women commissioned officers
had been scuttled in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   WASP records had been marked ``classified'' and sealed, so their
contribution to winning the war has not been recognized by many
historians.
</P>
<P>
   Not until 1977 did President Carter sign a bill giving the WASP
veteran's status.

<TEXT>
<P>
   During back-to-school season 25 years ago, any list of essential
items for dormitory rooms usually featured one piece of equipment
at the top: the stereo. Ten years later, the stereo still ruled,
but another appliance was also considered essential: the answering
machine.
</P>
<P>
   How 20th century, college students today might say.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, they declare, is the only item that could possibly
deserve to be first on any list of dorm necessities. In fact, the
computer not only displaces other technology in importance but also
replaces the need for some other appliances.
</P>
<P>
   It serves as the stereo for students who listen to MP3 files and
radio Webcasts. It makes answering machines less necessary because
so much communication occurs via e-mail and instant messages. It
even can substitute for televisions and alarm clocks.
</P>
<P>
   The computer has also become the portal through which students
do everything they need to do on campus. Using the Internet, they
register for classes, turn in assignments, order books, browse the
library catalog, listen to music, talk to friends, read the news,
write papers, play games, pay bills, watch movies and carry on
heated political discussions. Alumni returning to their alma maters
will find that the quads and classrooms still exist, but the
computer has become almost more central than the physical campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an invisible change,'' said Matthew Pittinsky,
co-chairman and founder of Blackboard, a software company that
serves more than 3,300 colleges. ``But it is probably the most
profound change that colleges have seen since the G.I. Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer's immense impact on the social and academic lives
of college students is just beginning to become apparent. Some
students say they are carrying on fewer conversations with their
dorm mates and more conversations with friends across the country.
Many students say that while they still hit the bars and coffee
shops, they rarely go to the library. One study shows that students
spend less free time watching television, now that they can be
entertained online.
</P>
<P>
   As students pivot toward online information, ``something clearly
has to give,'' said Eric Weil, managing partner in Student Monitor,
a market research company that polls college students. In the
latest Student Monitor survey, conducted in the spring, 56 percent
of the 1,200 respondents at colleges across the country said that
they had spent less time watching TV in the previous six months.
</P>
<P>
   What were they doing instead? About 42 percent said they were
spending more time surfing the Web and 49 percent said they were
spending more time sending and receiving e-mail. Academics played a
role too: Fifty-seven percent said they were spending more time
doing homework. In many cases, Weil said, that homework was
probably being done on a computer, often online.
</P>
<P>
   But some students say that it is not television that they
neglect. Instead, they are spending less time on the telephone or
talking face-to-face with their peers on campus. It is not that
they are being antisocial, the students say. They are simply
communicating with people in a different way, using e-mail, online
chats and streams of instant messages.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Kelson, a junior at Syracuse University, said he frequently
chatted online with his parents, his sister, his grandmother in
Florida and his friends at other colleges. ``It helps because
calling is expensive,'' Kelson said. ``And e-mail is good but it is
not as personal.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends often watch television while they chat, he
said. And more often than not, he said, he is chatting with people
in his dormitory, even though they may be only a few paces away.
Instead of picking up the telephone or knocking on his neighbors'
doors to see what they are up to, he will send them an instant
message.
</P>
<P>
   Kelson's case is not unusual, said Bennett Fisher, vice
president for community at CollegeClub.com, a social site for
students that has attracted nearly 3 million users. ``We used to
sit in the hallway and talk to students in the dorm,'' Fisher said.
``Now they do that on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Even conversations with professors, those moments of stimulating
intellectual discussion that some baby boomers may recall with
nostalgia, are often supplanted by online communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office hours are being replaced with e-mail discussions,''
said Gary Gigliotti, director of the Center for Teaching Excellence
at Rutgers University. Some regret the loss, but instead of waiting
for that one hour a week when professors open their doors, students
would rather talk online, Gigliotti said. ``It is more convenient
for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of this shift were planted in the early 1980s, when
technologically adept students started bringing computers to
campus. But back then, the machines were by no means essential.
They were primarily used for typing papers, and most students chose
to rely on the word-processing programs in computer laboratories
instead of buying their own machines. Computer science and
statistics students were often the only ones to use computers for
more than writing papers.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, when the Internet caught on beyond the halls
of engineering and computer science departments, that started to
change. Large universities began to invest tens of millions of
dollars in wiring dormitory rooms in the hope of providing
high-speed Internet access to every student. It was the beginning
of the race to provide what administrators call ``one port per
pillow.'' On average, campuses have wired about 63 percent of their
dormitories, according to the Campus Computing Project, an annual
survey of more than 500 institutions across the country. Private
research universities have gone the furthest: Of those surveyed,
all said they offered high-speed access in every dorm.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The availability of Internet access has become a deciding factor
for students who are trying to decide where to apply to college.
Yahoo Internet Life magazine produces an annual ranking, ``The 100
Most Wired Colleges.'' EduCause, a nonprofit organization that
promotes technology in higher education, has created an online
guide to help applicants determine which universities measure up to
their needs (www.educause.edu/consumerguide).
</P>
<P>
   Last spring in a sign of how important Internet access has
become, students at Michigan State University, where all but some
dormitories are wired, lined up seven hours in advance to make sure
they were assigned to wired housing. To help those who missed out,
the college installed voice mail. Everyone in those dorms uses the
telephone lines for dialup access, said James L. Carey, a
sophomore, ``and students would be online so much they would never
get phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest challenges facing administrators is whether to
require all entering students to bring a computer to college, and
whether it should be a laptop or desktop. Reports on the Educause
Web site show that about 100 universities have such a requirement,
which in some cases is imposed only on students in certain
programs. Next fall, the number will probably increase: About 11
percent of the institutions surveyed by the Campus Computing
Project last fall said they would have a laptop computer
requirement in place by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio University has decided to tackle the issue another way: It
has equipped every undergraduate dorm room with at least one new
$1,000 Gateway computer and printer. The cost of the equipment is
covered in an annual student fee.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much time do students spend on these machines?
Reports of time spent on the Internet alone show that students have
been increasing the number of hours they spend on their computers
each week. In the fall of 1998, according to Student Monitor,
students spent an average of 5.6 hours a week online. That rose to
7.2 hours in the fall of 1999 and 8.1 hours this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But many students say those numbers are even higher among
students with computers in dorms that have high-speed access to the
Internet. Shaun Encinias, a student at San Diego State University,
said he spent hours online each day, checking e-mail before leaving
his room in the morning, between classes, after classes and after
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail, though, is not necessarily the most important reason for
going online, according to the students polled by Student Monitor.
More than 44 percent said that ``schoolwork-related research'' was
their No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   Most courses now have an Internet component, professors say,
whether it is a Web-based syllabus, an e-mail-based discussion
board, an online repository of required reading or an interactive
quiz. Some instructors set up online chats with experts and
colleagues at other universities across the country. And many
students use the Internet and online library resources to do most,
if not all, their research for papers and projects. When they are
done, many send their papers via e-mail or click through Web pages
during presentations in class.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the computer can sway some students away from
academics, however. Carey, the sophomore at Michigan State, said he
failed all his classes his first semester. ``I was shellshocked,''
he said. ``I stayed in my room all the time.'' He would log on to
the Internet as soon as he woke up and hung out with friends he had
made online instead of doing homework or talking with friends on
campus. This year, he said, he is doing much better and uses his
computer mainly for homework.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has allowed students to reach beyond their campus
in ways they could not before, said Rick Thompson, director of
IBM's personal systems group. But, he warned, it can also lead to
more isolation. If you choose to interact online with people who
are just down the hall, for example, you are missing the chance to
see their facial expressions, how they look when they are joking,
what their body language tells you about their personality.
</P>
<P>
   Kaycee Swenson, a high school senior in Wichita, Kan., who took
several courses at her local college last year, said she talked to
people online everyday, most of whom were not at her campus. But
she said she also hung out with friends in the physical world,
listening to music and playing basketball. ``You have to balance
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, she will enroll full-time at the University of
California at San Diego, and she plans to take a new computer with
her, even though she already has one equipped with a Pentium II
processor. ``It's fast,'' she said, ``but not fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, when she talks to her mother about what she
brought to college decades ago, she cannot believe what students
had to put up with. ``She thought it was great,'' Swenson said,
``that she was able to take a calculator to college or a cassette
player to tape lectures.'' And when her mother said she had to
stand in line to register for classes and to wait for professors to
open their offices, she said she could hardly imagine it. ``I laugh
at those things,'' Swenson said, ``but I'm sure it wasn't fun, you
know?''

TEAMSTER WOES DETAILED NATIONWIDE BY FILMMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI AND SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allegations of strong-arm tactics, mob ties, and favoritism in
Boston Teamsters' dealings with the movie industry _ currently
being probed by a federal grand jury _ have been variously
described as disturbing and overblown.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing they apparently are not, according to union
officials, is unique.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of Teamsters locals across the country reveals
widespread problems with those who deal with movie and television
productions, resulting in the suspension and firing of union
officials and even criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for example, a powerful member of Local 25 has
allegedly intimidated movie officials into renting equipment from a
company he runs on the side. In Honolulu last year, a local
Teamster was convicted of torching trailers belonging to a rival
rental company.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, disgruntled rank-and-file union members say that
lucrative film and TV work goes to a select group of members, many
of whom have criminal records and ties to organized crime. Similar
allegations have dogged local union officials in Florida, Texas,
and Illinois, contributing to their locals being taken over the
international union.
</P>
<P>
   The reason problems are so rampant in the Teamsters' dealings
with the movie industry, specialists say, is that the glamorous and
cushy jobs are often used to curry loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Those who get the jobs remain loyal in order to keep them;
others, hopeful to one day make it onto the coveted movie lists,
are cowed into silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a closed system that feeds on itself,'' said one
local member of Teamsters For a Democratic Union, the reform
faction of the 1.5 million-member union. ``It becomes a retro-power
center in the local and it is only natural for that to connect with
corruption and organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 report to Congress, the Independent Review Board, a
government-appointed watchdog group established as part of a civil
settlement between the Teamsters and the Justice Department,
apparently agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Teamsters Local 714 in Chicago, review board
investigation found that nepotism and favoritism were the guiding
criteria for assigning the best work controlled by the local.
</P>
<P>
   Control of that work _ the movie and trade-show business _
contributed to control of the 10,000-member local by members of one
family, the review board report said. In fact, the board found that
there hadn't been a contested election for a union office since at
least 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Other locals have had similar troubles, including Local 390 in
Miami, which was placed into trusteeship by the international in
1996 due to alleged ``nepotism'' in the assigning of jobs on film
and TV shoots. The previous year, the president of Local 79 in
Tampa was suspended for giving jobs to family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, meanwhile, the IRB recommended putting Local 745 into
trusteeship after finding that the premium work under the local's
control was assigned on the basis of nepotism and favoritism. The
IRB also found that top organized crime figures from the Midwest
had infiltrated the union.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Teamster local in Rhode Island with
criminal backgrounds or ties to organized crime have landed jobs as
drivers on major film productions in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, at least four such members of Teamster
Local 251 in Providence have been working on the set of ``Osmosis
Jones,'' a movie by the Farrelly brothers being shot in the
Plymouth area.
</P>
<P>
   They include Anthony Parrillo, who was paroled in 1993 after
serving 16 years in the manslaughter death of two men. He was also
a member of the Teamster crew that worked on the Farrelly
production last year, ``Me, Myself and Irene,'' according to
documents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other sources say that Ronnie Carter, also a member
of Teamster Local 251 in Providence whose criminal record includes
arrests for assault with a dangerous weapon, drunk driving and
possession of cocaine, has also worked on movie productions filmed
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who helped establish the Rhode Island chapter of the
Hells Angels, is one of several men with ties to the motorcycle
gang or to organized crime who are caught up in an investigation of
the Teamster Local 251 by Rhode Island authorities. The other two
Teamsters from Local 251 in Providence who have worked on the
``Osmosis Jones'' set are: Danny Allen, a close associate of
Parrillo's who has been under investigation by Rhode Island
authorites for allegedly fencing stolen property, and Jeff
Chakoian, whose late brother had ties to the Patriarca crime
family.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 interview with Ch. 12, WPRI-TV in Providence, Stuart
Mundy, president of Local 251, defended the practice of giving the
highly-paid positions of film crew drivers to individuals with
criminal records. Parrillo was assigned based on his work record,
not his criminal record, Mundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Mundy did not return phone calls Tuesday. George Cashman,
president of Local 25 in Boston, also did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   However, a source familiar with the ``Osmosis Jones'' production
said that said that the four from the Providence local were among
more than two dozen drivers who had been hired to work on the movie
by Robert Martini, the Teamsters transportation coordinator on the
set. The others were all members of Local 25 in Boston, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martini had been pleased with Parrillo's work on last year's
movie by the Farrelly brothers, which was shot in Rhode Island,
Massachusetts and Vermont, and sought him out again this summer,
the source said. He was unable to explain how the other three
members of Local 251 had gained their jobs on the set.
</P>
<P>
   The source also said that because another major Hollywood
production is being filmed in Boston, ``What's the Worst That Could
Happen?'', there is currently a shortage of qualified Teamsters to
work on movie productions.

   GOP-DEM-STEAL (Washington) _ It's taking place in broad daylight
with hardly a furtive glance _ the Democratic candidates for the

issues almost as eagerly as their GOP rivals are trying to co-opt

of the party in power. If that tradition prevails in November, Al
Gore will win. But another rule, which will help George W. Bush, is
that people favor a return to the White House of the party that has
been out of power for a while. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

ONLINE SHOPPER: THE INS AND OUTS OF THE ONLINE CD MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits) 
 By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trading in your compact discs can be a humiliating experience.
As you stand at the counter, trying to recover some cash for a
musical experiment gone awry or a summer hit that started to sound
silly in the fall, you often learn that your $16.98 investment is
now worth a couple of bucks _ or nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Grundy, president and a founder of Spun.com, a used-CD shop
on the Web, knows the feeling. ``I've walked into stores with a
stack of 10 CDs and they're like, `I'll take these two,''' Grundy
said.
</P>
<P>
   By selling discs on the Internet, he said, online customers can
avoid ``the clerk with a pierced nose who laughs at you and seems
to be saying, `You bought this?'''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not ashamed to admit that my large, eclectic collection
consists mainly of previously owned titles acquired at local shops.
But in recent months, I've started buying most of my used CDs over
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Used CDs can provide a cost-effective alternative for those who
feel new disc prices are too high but are uncomfortable with the
intangibility and questionable legality of free song downloads
through sites like Napster.
</P>
<P>
   The online selection at sites like Spun.com, SecondSpin.com and
smaller operations like UsedMusicExchange.com tended to be better
than what I found at the neighborhood stores, and because I rarely
rush to pick up a new release, I'm willing to wait until a CD comes
available.
</P>
<P>
   Buying used CDs online is no different from buying new discs:
Search for the CDs you want, toss them in a virtual shopping cart
and pay with your credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Some online stores also sell new CDs and used movies and
computer games. Several sites augment album entries with song lists
and audio clips, but to make sure I am getting the latest reissue
(the one with all the bonus tracks) and a sufficient price break, I
usually open another browser window and crosscheck the entries
against those on sites that sell new CDs. This method is reliable
but not fail-safe.
</P>
<P>
   A disc of Debussy piano music that arrived last week from
Spun.com was a live recording from a performance in Italy instead
of the major-label classic that I expected. The company will pay
for the return.
</P>
<P>
   I conducted an informal check of five used-CD sites by shopping
for six popular but slightly dated releases _ ``Play'' by Moby,
``Supernatural'' by Carlos Santana, ``On How Life Is'' by Macy
Gray, ``Fly'' by the Dixie Chicks, ``Human Clay'' by Creed and
``Appalachian Journey'' by Yo Yo Ma, Edgar Meyer and Mark O'Connor
_ and found the potential savings to be considerable.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the same discs new, at discounted prices, from Amazon.com
would cost $71.94. Including shipping and handling fees, the lowest
total would have been $49.44, from SecondSpin.com for the used CDs.
</P>
<P>
   I have rarely received a defective disc, only two of the 150
I've ordered in two years, and all the used-CD sites guarantee
their merchandise. But availability can be an issue, if not an
outright disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Spun.com was the only site with all six discs in stock, for
$53.94. Most of the sites had half the titles on hand, and
SecondSpin.com had one. But inventories changed daily, and several
sites offered a notification feature that sent an e-mail message
when a desired title arrived.
</P>
<P>
   I also tested the stores with five obscure titles, including
``Too Tired to Sleep'' by Dirk Hamilton and ``Bricolage'' by Amon
Tobin, and five just-released titles, including ``The Marshall
Mathers LP'' by Eminem and ``Anarchy'' by Busta Rhymes. Once again,
Spun.com's shelves were full when the others were empty. Grundy
said used copies of current titles usually sell quickly.
</P>
<P>
   So much for buying CDs, what about selling. Like everyone else,
I have acquired my share of turkeys. And as I discovered last week,
using the Internet to trade discs can be more complicated than
buying them. Determining the value of your castoff discs required
some effort, and it might take several weeks to receive
compensation in cash or virtual credit.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any guarantee that your undesirable CDs would be
accepted. When I asked Todd Ramcke, general manager of
UsedMusicExchange.com in Glendale, Calif., via an e-mail message
how much he would pay for a Mahler symphony and another disc of
classical music, he replied, ``Sorry, but both of the CDs you want
to trade us are of no value to us. Try SecondSpin.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in cyberspace, my rejects had been cruelly rejected. In a
subsequent phone interview, Ramcke apologetically confessed,
``Classical stuff we just don't sell at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Grundy said most Spun.com customers sell discs at the same time
they buy. The company sends a postage-paid mailer for trade-in
discs along with the order. SwapIt.com ships a postage-paid
container when you register online, or you can print out a mailing
label from its site.
</P>
<P>
   SecondSpin.com and the CD Exchange (www.thecdexchange.com)
require you to pay the freight, although the CD Exchange lets you
cut costs by keeping the jewel-box containers.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to trade-ins, online stores can be just as picky
as real-world shops. The discs are expected to be playable, and the
cover and liner notes must be intact. Recordable CDs are out, as
are designated as being for promotional purposes. (CashForCDs.com
buys promo copies.) SecondSpin.com deducts 50 cents for cracked or
broken cases.
</P>
<P>
   Determining the value of trade-ins takes work. The CD Exchange
lets you type in a list of discs and returns a quote, but most
sites ask you to search for titles and add them to a trade-in cart.
When a title can't be found, you can sometimes use the number on a
disc's universal product code.
</P>
<P>
   I also sought trade-in quotes for a half-dozen discs, a mix of
mainstream and offbeat titles. Despite my best efforts, I had
trouble getting prices for the nonhit CDs _ or they weren't
accepted at all.
</P>
<P>
   Of the sites that would take all six discs, Spun.com and
SwapIt.com offered the best deals: about $30. Except for Spun.com,
which offered an immediate credit, the others asked me to send in
the CDs, whose value would be verified, and then would send a check
or issue a credit, a process that generally takes two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, I took the same six discs to the local branch of
Djangos, a national chain store that sells used CDs but does not
accept trade-ins through its Web site (www.djangomusic.com). The
clerk examined the CDs and offered me $13. He was overruled by a
manager who was monitoring the transaction and upped the offer to
$18 in cash or $24 in store credit.
</P>
<P>
   I could do better online, so I turned down the offer. The clerk
looked puzzled, and maybe a little hurt. But I'll still shop there.
I found a musical cast recording of ``Babes in Arms'' for just
$7.95.
</P>
<P>
   What a steal.

TV VIEWERS ARE BUGGED BY `BUGS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scene from a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit:
</P>
<P>
   Actors Tim Meadows, Cheri Oteri, Will Ferrell and Fort Worth's
own Bill Paxton play newscasters trying to deliver the evening
headlines _ only they can't, because as the newscast progresses,
more and more graphics pop up on the screen, obscuring them.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the skit, the four are clawing at the screen and
desperately jumping around, trying to peer out from behind the
barrage of TV logos, sports scores, weather forecasts and financial
stats that have taken over the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The skit, ``Newsforce,'' aired more than a year ago, in January
1999, but the point is even more valid now: You simply cannot watch
a sports channel, a news broadcast or, in some cases, a movie
without being inundated with ancillary information.
</P>
<P>
   Most TV and cable networks run their logos _ called ``bugs'' _
in one of the four screen corners throughout every show. Top that
with the sports scores or weather advisories that constantly zoom
across the bottom of the screen, which are known as ``tickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pile onto that a graphic heralding Emmy nominations for the show
you're watching and teasers for which show is coming on next or
what's going to be on the news later.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make Robert Carlock pen the ``Saturday Night
Live'' skit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they're throwing information at you just for the
sake of throwing information at you,'' the SNL writer and producer
says, speaking by phone from New York. ``It's an overload. I'm
watching CNBC right now and I can't tell what's going on, there's
so much stuff on my screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlock's got a point: Specialty networks, such as news stations
CNN and Headline News and financial network CNBC, try to cram an
especially enormous amount of information onto your screen, from
sports scores to stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Capelli, vice president of public relations for CNBC,
says that's why people watch such stations _ they want the
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have viewers, we have users,'' Capelli says of the
network's recently upgraded ticker, which delivers up-to-the-second
stock trade information. ``It allows the individual to act on
information that's current, that's live. We're making information
available to individuals, and they can act on it and make money
from it. They love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCarley, communications director for the NBC Olympics,
says that on-screen information, such as network bugs, is necessary
in today's hundred-channel TV universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, it identifies the station, obviously, and if you're
traveling a lot, you'll know the affiliate,'' he says. ``And it
also helps deter piracy. Someone may be going around selling
videotapes of some movie, then there's our logo at the bottom of
the screen, so you know they taped it.''
</P>
<P>
   The logos, McCarley adds, also help people remember the network.
And the better the logo, the more likely you are to remember it.
NBC's striking Olympics logo is a peacock engulfed by Olympic
rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peacock is one of the most recognizable brands in the
U.S.,'' he says. ``And the Olympic rings are one of the most
sought-after brands in the world. You're not going to forget that
logo.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just news shows that are being plagued by
information overload. VH1 and Fox Movie Network run specialty shows
_ Pop Up Videos and Production Notes Presents _ in which music
videos and theatrical movies are cluttered with ``pop-up''
factoids, such as ``This was so-and-so's directorial debut,'' ``The
day of the shoot, Madonna had a cold'' and ``Can you spot the
up-and-comer in this cluster of nobodies?''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hall, vice president of programming and production for Fox
Movie Channel, defends Production Notes Presents, saying the
station is simply trying to put an interesting, informative spin on
the movies it shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our equivalent to a DVD or director's cut,'' Hall says,
referring to the ``extras'' many DVD movie releases include. ``We
present you with all the information you could ever want about that
particular movie. It gives viewers an insight into the filmmaking
process. But it's just a handful of films we're doing it with, and
we only do it about once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall says all the movies that are shown on Production Notes
Presents are also shown in their original, uncut, uncluttered forms
at other times.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that he defends Production Notes Presents, Hall
also acknowledges that the bombardment of secondary information is
veering out of control and that some viewers aren't happy about it.
That's why, he says, Fox Movie Channel tries to keep its station
IDs as low-key as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bug is far less obtrusive than standard network bugs
because it's not on during the whole movie,'' he says. ``ABC's or
NBC's are there for the whole film. With our films, we try to
replicate the moviegoing experience as much as we can. We try to be
as unobtrusive as possible. I can't say that about everyone else.''

AT STRATFORD, A MARATHON OF 15TH CENTURY ENGLISH HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATFORD-ON-AVON, England _ Facing one of the most demanding
theatrical challenges imaginable, William Houston has stopped
smoking and drinking and eats steak for lunch. His obsession is so
complete that he hardly noticed when a steak was brought to his
table one day recently, letting it sit for half an hour before
taking a bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is killing me,'' Houston lamented. ``I'm so dog-tired.
Living like this is driving me crazy. I'm into it every hour of the
day, and then I dream about it at night. Every day I think, `I
can't do this, I'm not up to this, I'm not physically strong
enough, I can't carry it off.' I look in the mirror and see myself
aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally noticing the plate in front of him, he sighed, tossed
the mangled napkin onto the table and tried to calm himself. ``All
right, all right, we'll get it,'' he said, seemingly to himself.
``Little stressed out these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston is a crucial figure in an extraordinary marathon that is
unfolding on the stages of the Royal Shakespeare Company here. Over
the next year the company will present, in chronological order,
eight history plays in which Shakespeare depicts the upheaval of
15th-century England. The plays contain some of his finest poetry,
deepest insights and most memorable characters.
</P>
<P>
   Because the plays cover closely related historical events,
seeing them together is an incomparably richer experience than
seeing them individually. It is also a rare one, having been
attempted less than a half-dozen times on the British stage.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fascination of the current series is that many roles
are carried from one play to the next by the same actors. Houston
appears as the wild Prince Hal in the first part of ``Henry IV,''
drinking, wenching and stealing purses. In the second part he
portrays the prince as he assumes the throne, pledging that he has
``turned away my former self.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston is also rehearsing the title role of ``Henry V,'' the
warrior king who inspires his nation by conquering France and
setting an example of noble leadership. He must play the character
over a period of more than two decades, growing t in years, wisdom
and dignity. To add to the challenge, the first two plays are
performed in period costume while the third, which is to have its
premiere on Aug. 24, has a different director and is done in a
modern post-apocalyptic setting.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, 32, has played just one title role with the Royal
Shakespeare Company, the relatively straightforward male lead in
``Troilus and Cressida.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's eight-play sequence covers a period of 87 years.
The first play, ``Richard II,'' opens in 1398 with the king
adjudicating a dispute between two of his nobles, one of whom,
Henry Bolingbroke, will overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
   The series continues with both parts of ``Henry IV,'' which show
Bolingbroke reigning as a troubled monarch, then dying and leaving
his throne to Hal; ``Henry V,'' in which Hal rules brilliantly; and
the three parts of ``Henry VI,'' depicting England's collapse into
civil war. It ends with ``Richard III,'' whose title character
rises to power by killing his closest friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The last scene of ``Richard III'' depicts the king's death in
battle as he calls in vain for a horse. Bosworth Field, where the
battle was fought in 1485, is 40 miles from Stratford. A plaque
marks the spot where Richard fell.
</P>
<P>
   After the Stratford season ends in October, the first of the
history plays will move to London. The series will continue into
next year. There is no plan for a full-fledged foreign tour,
although the company will perform the last four plays at the
University of Michigan on two successive weekends next March.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, the first plays of the series need much more than a
gifted actor as Hal. The role of Bolingbroke needs at least an
equal talent, and for that the Royal Shakespeare Company has chosen
one of its veterans, David Troughton. He portrays Bolingbroke first
as an offended knight, then as a scheming politician who deposes a
king, and finally as a dying monarch who fears God will never
forgive him for the ``indirect crook'd ways I met this crown.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A play's relevance to the modern day, no matter how old the
play is, will come out,'' Troughton said before one recent
performance. ``It was just so brilliant that as we were preparing
this play, a bunch of British football hooligans were arrested in
France. It shows what the plays are telling us, which is that we
are a nation of thugs. We are very good at beating people up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patriotism and jingoism is what moves this country,'' he said.
``When Bolingbroke dies, he tells his son to `busy giddy minds with
foreign quarrels.'' Troughton sees contemporary parallels like the
war in the Falklands. He likens Bolingbroke to Prime Minister Tony
Blair, ``because he's so desperate to be liked and knows every
trick to use to become liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Troughton and others involved in the project do not see its
importance as limited to Britain. In the lobby of one of the
Stratford theaters they are displaying a notebook full of material
they used to prepare themselves. It includes historical accounts
and a newspaper article portraying Blair as obsessed with his
image, but also articles about slaughter in Africa and photographs
of 20th-century strongmen ranging from Franco to Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The two parts of ``Henry IV'' are classics not just because of
the ways they deal with great historical and political themes, or
even because of their magnificent verse. They are also the works
that brought to life one of the great comic figures in theatrical
history, the bloated Falstaff, ``that trunk of humors, that
bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that
huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted
Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the attraction of the plays is that they cover vast
ground, from city to country, battlefield to council chamber, royal
palace to taverns and brothels, and that their characters are not
only contending nobles but also drunkards, braggarts, pickpockets
and whores. Without Falstaff the plays would be all but
unthinkable, and in the current Stratford productions Falstaff is
played by Desmond Barrit, who established a reputation as a great
comic actor with his successes as Malvolio in ``Twelfth Night'' and
Bottom in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing for me and for everyone in these plays is that
you have so much time to develop your character,'' Barrit said as
he sipped tea on a balcony overlooking the Avon River. ``You
needn't show too much at once. Not only do you have a chance to
decide what you want to hold back for the second scene, you can
even hold things back for the second play.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the actors who play Bolingbroke and Prince Hal, Barrit
finds himself merging with his character more fully than many
actors do when they perform in single plays. After some
performances he turns up at a pub down the street from the theater,
and there he seems almost as riveting a figure as Falstaff was in
the taverns of Eastcheap.
</P>
<P>
   The two personalities even merge onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince Charles is the patron of our company, and Henry IV is
his favorite play,'' Barrit said with a Falstaffian glimmer in his
eye. ``He came to one of our first performances, and at the point
where Falstaff says he hopes to become a duke or an earl, I stared
right at him. Later I realized I was doing just what Falstaff did.
I was looking at the future king of England and saying I hoped the
knighthood would be pending.''

BLOW THE WHISTLE, HONEY, WHEN A PICTURE COMES IN 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM S. NIEDERKORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here's the dish about the dish. The dish on my roof.
The dish that got me out from under the cable monopoly:
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy putting it there. And it was more expensive than
I thought.
</P>
<P>
   A few of us still remember when television was free. It used to
be delivered by an antenna on top of the set, but a good picture of
that sort hasn't been seen in Manhattan since S. Klein's on the
Square.
</P>
<P>
   So we had to have cable. The first unfree television bill was a
few dollars a month. But cable's channel packages kept changing,
and to keep AMC, Bravo, TNT and other channels our household likes,
we had to pay more. And more and more.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the Time Warner Cable bill exceeding $40 a month,
without premium channels _ no ``Sopranos,'' no ``Sex and the
City,'' no pay-per-view movies _ I joined the cable monopoly
revolt. I made a call and said, ``Give me the dish!''
</P>
<P>
   I'd seen offers for free satellite television systems. But the
one that caught my eye came in the e-mail in June from a DirecTV
dealer. It was $29 for the system (I'd seen other systems for $99
or more), plus one year of service at a monthly rate of $21.99 for
about 40 channels.
</P>
<P>
   Under ``terms'' the e-mail message added a caveat: The system
had to be activated within 30 days, or we would be charged $299 for
the equipment. A month seemed plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   But installing it was something less than direct.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a city guy. I was an Eagle Scout. I compose music in my free
time, and I built my own Web site. This would be a piece of cake.
The only problem seemed to be whether our landlord would allow a
satellite dish on the roof. He gave me the go-ahead _ he was ready
to join the revolt, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the toll-free number for Standard Satellite, the seller in
the e-mail message, I quickly closed the deal with a telephone
salesclerk.
</P>
<P>
   For $35 more, she would even send along a package with
``everything needed'' to install the dish myself: 100 feet of RG-6
cable, a compass, an instructional videotape and other items that
sounded promising.
</P>
<P>
   Still waiting for delivery from Standard Satellite a week after
the order _ and with the meter running _ I phoned again. A
different salesclerk answered and assured me that the company was
not out to get customers for the $299; the penalty was just to
prevent people from ordering the system and using it with another
company. I'd measured the distance from my television set to where
the landlord suggested I put the dish. I'd need 175 feet of cable.
But Standard Satellite could provide only what came in the kit, she
said. It was not, in fact, a nice continuous 100 feet of cable, but
two pieces of cable: 75 feet and 25 feet. She told me I could buy
more cable at a store like Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   On the ninth day after I placed the order, two packages arrived:
a big one with the dish and the receiver, and a small one with the
installation kit. It was somewhat of a shock to find that the
instructional videotape showed a young couple installing the dish
in a rural or suburban one-story, single-family dwelling. My
fantasy had been that the tape would show how to install it in a
city apartment building. Just as disconcerting was the introductory
part of the video, which listed the supposed contents of the $35
kit.
</P>
<P>
   There were the promised pieces of cable, 4plastic wire ties, a
compass, 4 lag screws, a ground block, 15 feet of ground wire, 25
feet of phone wire, a 6-foot video cable and a dual connector for
the phone so that DirecTV could monitor the receiver for billing
purposes. But where were the washers, the lead-shield expansion
anchors, the ground clamp, nail clips, the tube of silicon sealant,
the in-line coupler, the 6-foot stereo audiovideo cable, the
protractor and the 2 feed-through bushings _ all of which the video
also inventoried? By the way, what were feed-through bushings?
(They're plastic caps used to shield cable when it passes through
the outside wall of a suburban ranch house.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   I called the dealer and got the first phone clerk again. After
at first insisting that the kit contained everything I would
require to install the dish, she finally conceded that it contained
everything the company had determined was needed. And if there was
anything else I needed, I could just go get it myself.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks a lot.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of stonewall you'd expect if you unwittingly
bought gray-market goods and tried to return them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   I spent $25 on a 100-foot length of cable and a cable coupler at
Radio Shack and $20 or so at the hardware store for a masonry drill
bit, wire ties, washers and expansion anchors, which would hold the
screws in the brick wall where I was putting up the dish. I had to
buy two 50-foot extension cords for our old electric drill, to
reach from our fourth-floor apartment to the roof above our
six-story building. For $5 each at Odd Lots, that beat buying a
cordless drill for $65 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the fun part. The video proved to be just about
useless. Fortunately, the main dish package came with printed
instructions, and the DirecTV Web site had good suggestions.
Drilling the holes into the roof wall was good for the biceps.
Getting the dish up, and running the cable down to our apartment,
would not challenge anyone who has passed Erector Set merit badge.
The instructions weren't too clear about attaching the ground wire.
But four phone calls later, even that problem was solved, and I
grounded the system to a radiator. (Think of Ben Franklin flying
his kite with a key attached to the string.)
</P>
<P>
   Next came something harder: aiming the dish. I'd done Franklin;
now I needed Admiral Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Relative to the Earth, DirecTV's satellite is a stationary
object in space. It orbits at the same speed as the Earth turns, so
it seems to be in one place in the sky all the time. I had to aim
the dish at exactly this spot, using the compass that comes with
the kit, which is about the size of the Sacajawea dollar _ but far
less valuable.
</P>
<P>
   A trusty assistant is essential for this phase of the
installation, and if your apartment is a few floors from where you
are putting the dish, I recommend placing her near a window and
equipping her with a whistle loud enough to be heard on the roof,
where you will be stationed dishside with a socket wrench and that
precision compass. She will also have to run back and forth from
the window to the television, which is no harder to connect to the
satellite receiver than it was to the cable box. Using a remote
control unit, she can bring up a menu on screen that shows the
strength of the satellite signal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when it comes to aiming the dish, the DirecTV Web site's
help pages say, ``We highly recommend that you have it
professionally installed.'' But as I had gotten this far, there was
no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   This was my first time dealing with terms like ``elevation'' and
``azimuth'' coordinates. You enter your ZIP code on DirecTV's
dish-pointer Web page, or you can do it through the satellite
receiver on the TV. In my case, the azimuth was 231.8, meaning that
if I put the compass needle on N, I should point the dish at 231.8
degrees, or over toward the southwest. My elevation coordinate
turned up as 35.5 degrees, or about a third of the way up from the
horizon to the zenith.
</P>
<P>
   It was trial and error, with me clambering up and down the
super's ladder from the top of the elevator shaft to the roof,
where I could yell down to the apartment and hear how we were
doing.
</P>
<P>
   I started at 32 degrees, by using a scale etched in the arm
holding the dish, and swept the dish around, horizontally, in an
arc of 30 degrees or so, hoping to hear a whistle from three
stories below. When that pass didn't succeed, I raised the
elevation half a degree and repeated the routine. After numerous
tries, I heard the eureka whistle. Like Houston suddenly making
contact with astronauts coming round the dark side of the moon, the
picture came in. For a few days, we made adjustments until our
signal strength was above 90. (Anything over 70 is considered OK.)
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   So you may be wondering, then, was it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the satellite picture is better than cable's. For $10
more, or a total of $31.99 to DirecTV, we get Total Choice _
100-plus channels, which include almost all the cable-only stations
that Time Warner offers with its Standard-plus-MetroChoice package
and more besides: I'm delighted with the international news
channels and programs like ``Ground Break'' on BBC America. In one
episode, a hardy band of landscapers and a droll narrator help a
woman create a surprise for her husband, who is away on a trip. In
a half-hour of airtime, they add a decorative pool, a boardwalk, a
row of cedars and other fine touches to a formerly barren backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Trio, a Canadian channel with a horde of dramatic series, showed
a beautiful print of Fellini's ``Casanova'' the other night,
without commercial interruption.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV's competitor, the Dish Network, has a similar deal
called America's Top 100, for $29.99 a month. Each company's
package contains about 15 channels that the competitor does not
carry. Both packages include over 30 channels not in Time Warner's
comparably priced Basic-plus-Standard-plus-MetroChoice package.
</P>
<P>
   But for local channels, Time Warner has the satellite services
beat. Satellite TV does not offer New York 1 (Time Warner's own
channel), nor the local PBS station, Channel 13, nor even WWOR,
Channel 9. You don't get local channels from DirecTV at all unless
you pay $5.99 more, and then they are only national versions of
CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC and PBS, along with WPIX.
</P>
<P>
   We can't do without CUNY-TV, the Crosswalks stations and the
Manhattan Neighborhood Cable stations, so we've decided to keep
Time Warner Basic service for the local stations, at about $15 a
month. With our satellite connection that gives us all but half a
dozen of the channels we used to have with Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we cut about $25 off our Time Warner Cable bill. The
bottom line is, we have better quality and more variety, but our
monthly television bill is about $5 less free than it used to be.

NO LECTURES OR TEACHERS, JUST SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By JOSHUA GREEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The red phone on your desk rings sharply in the middle of the
night. The voice you hear is that of the White House chief of
staff, alerting you to a crisis in the Eastern European country of
Krasnovia. You're needed at the White House, pronto. ``We'll send a
limo,'' he says, and hangs up. After an emergency meeting with the
president, you're given a classified intelligence report and access
to the country's foremost diplomats, policy analysts and military
leaders. You are to submit a report in time for a presidential
address that evening. The president is waiting to act on your
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to high school, circa 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is from an interactive software course, Crisis in
Krasnovia, that its creator, Roger Schank, believes will
revolutionize how children are taught. ``Software is going to
replace classes as we know them,'' said Schank, director of the
Institute for Learning Sciences at Northwestern University. After a
career studying artificial intelligence at Stanford and Yale,
Schank has shifted his sights from teaching computers to teaching
students. In 1995, he founded Cognitive Arts, a company that is
exploring commercial uses of software-based teaching.
</P>
<P>
   A critic of traditional teaching methods, Schank wants to use
technology to overhaul the entire educational system. ``The
computer is our Trojan mouse,'' he said. ``It allows us to get our
foot in the door to do something radical and difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the Institute for Learning Sciences and Cognitive Arts,
Schank and his staff have developed more than 100 programs, many of
them, like Krasnovia, purely for learning research. But the company
has also created courses for clients like Arthur Andersen, the
Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Schank is marketing his courses to universities and believes
they will be attracted by the potential savings and by the
program's academic pedigree. In May, Cognitive Arts announced it
would join with Columbia University to develop 80 software-based
courses that correspond directly to existing Columbia courses. In
June, Harvard Business School said it would begin offering
pre-enrollment software courses designed by Cognitive Arts to
students who had been accepted for enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Schank's programs combine the look of high-tech video games with
a Mission Impossible-style narrative. A course in biology, for
instance, might challenge students to stop a worldwide virus
outbreak; an economics course might have them play the role of
adviser to the chairman of the Federal Reserve; a physics course
might entail building a rocket and landing it on the moon. In
essence, each software course is like an elaborate
choose-your-own-ending novel.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to get students to delve into a course's volumes of
academic information, including hours of videotape of experts in a
field related to the program. Students running Krasnovia, for
example, can draw on video advice from Thomas Boyatt, a former
ambassador, and Bruce Laingen, an American diplomat who was held
hostage in Iran and is president of the American Academy of
Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than subject students to full-blown lectures, Schank
breaks the video into snippets that address only the question at
hand. He believes students learn more effectively through this
piecemeal approach, which he calls ``just in time'' learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of the computer is that it allows kids to learn by
doing,'' he said. ``People don't learn by being talked at. They
learn when they attempt to do something and fail. Learning happens
when they try to figure out why.''
</P>
<P>
   Bald, bearded and powerfully built, Schank's appearance and
demeanor suggest Marlon Brando in the movie ``Apocalypse Now.'' His
professional reputation is somewhat similar. His brusque manner and
outspoken criticism of those he disagrees with have alienated some
colleagues and earned him the reputation of iconoclast. But his
success in designing teaching software has made him a much sought
after figure among businesses, military clients and universities.
</P>
<P>
   His company puts extraordinary effort into creating software
courses, each of which can take up to a year to design and can cost
up to $1 million. Video is an important component of Schank's
program. After interviewing professors, his staff develops a story,
writes a script, hires professional actors and begins filming.
Cognitive Arts even arranged the use of CNN footage of the Bosnian
conflict to lend the aura of authenticity to Crisis in Krasnovia.
</P>
<P>
   The programs allow students to progress at their own pace.
Schank says the semester system is badly outdated, a view he also
holds for most tests, which foster only temporary memorization, he
says. His programs require students to write detailed reports on
what they have learned. A student who cuts corners does not finish
the course, and the failing grade is delivered in the spirit of a
video game. In Krasnovia, for instance, an incomplete report would
draw a mock newscast in which commentators ridicule the president's
address. Students must then go back and improve their work.

   These multimedia simulations differ radically from current
online offerings. ``When you look at online courses now, what do
you see?'' Schank said. ``Text online with a quiz. We're not taking
a lecture and putting it on screen. We're restructuring these
courses into goal-based scenarios that will get kids excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Schank says that such courses will render traditional classes _
and many professors _ obsolete. ``The idea of one professor for one
class is ancient,'' he said. ``New technology is going to give
every student access to the best professors in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But many academics dismiss Schank's prediction that traditional
teaching methods will soon become obsolete and question software
learning's pedagogic value. ``Education depends on relationships
between people,'' said David Noble, a history professor at York
University in Toronto and a critic of online learning.
``Interactive is not the same as interpersonal. What Schank doesn't
recognize is that teaching is not just about relaying knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Others warn against accepting radical new technology without
pause. ``The American university system is a highly functional
institution,'' said Phil Agre, an associate professor of
information studies at UCLA. ``The danger is that we will apply
overly simplistic ideas about technology and tear apart the
institution before we really know what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another assessment of the value of Schank's work is offered by
Prof. Howard Nusbaum, chairman of the psychology department at the
University of Chicago. ``Schank's idea in principal is a very sound
one,'' Professor Nusbaum said. ``But in the case of software
learning, its success or failure will depend on implementation more
than theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the country's top universities are experimenting with
ways to implement new technology-based teaching methods. Seymour
Papert, a professor and researcher at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology's Media Laboratory, was among the first to advocate
computers as teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is changing so fast that the concept of schools
teaching people what they need to know is no longer viable,''
Papert said. ``We're moving into a time when people need to know
how to learn things they weren't taught in school. Second, we now
have the technology to let kids learn better. This will not just
allow them to learn the same things better; it will teach kids to
learn radical new things at all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchel Resnick, another professor at MIT's Media Laboratory,
said: ``Computers offer kids multiple ways to learn, where in the
past there was only one way. Ultimately, you want kids to have a
tool chest of different options they can bring to bear when solving
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But new technology also threatens to exacerbate current
inequities. Resnick worries that the so-called digital divide will
not be one of access to computers but a ``fluency gap'' between
those able to use them for learning and those who merely use them
to play games.
</P>
<P>
   Schank does not think his programs will be a victim of the
digital divide. He believes that poorer schools are likely to
benefit first from his programs. Top high schools ``don't want this
_ their kids get into Harvard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But poorer schools,'' he continued, ``aren't going to turn
down a college level software course that's endorsed by
Columbia.''.
</P>
<P>
   Schank pointed to the example of the Daniel Jenkins Academy, a
public high school in Polk County, Fla., a poor district that will
switch to online teaching this fall. Students will gather in
classrooms where they will take Web-based classes on computers.
They will be taught remotely by teachers working from their homes.
Schank suggested that once disadvantaged students began
outperforming those from better schools, many of the long-held
assumptions about teaching will go the way of the slide rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole country of people who agree on education, and
they're all wrong,'' he said with characteristic bluntness.
``School just isn't that relevant anymore. We'll make it relevant.
We're trying to overthrow the system.''

 &HT;    STATISTICAL PORTRAIT SHOWS THE ELDERLY'S LOT IMPROVING
 &HT;    With OLDER-DATA.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans are living longer, healthier and
wealthier than ever before, but there are wide disparities based on
age, race and sex, according to a federal report released
Thursday.(cq)
</P>
<P>
   The 128-page report, which compiles data from more than a dozen
federal agencies, is the first in a series that will track 31 key
indicators of the nation's elderly population.
</P>
<P>
   The report paints a graphic picture of a growing, thriving and
increasingly more ethnically diverse population of Americans aged
65 and older. It also pinpoints areas where the elderly have not
fared well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really are two stories here,'' said Richard Suzman, an
associate director at the National Institute on Aging. ``One is how
much progress there has been in a variety of areas: life
expectancy, health, disability, reduction of poverty, increase in
eduction ... juxtaposed with the fact that not everyone has shared
equally in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The size and share of the elderly population is growing
dramatically, and the aging of the baby boom generation born
between 1946 and 1964 will accelerate the trend.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 times more elderly Americans at the turn of the
21st century than there were at the turn of the 20th, and the
number will double again to about 70 million by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   A child born in 1900 had a life expectancy of about 49 years,
while a child born in 1997 had a life expectancy of more than 76
years. In both cases, the figure is higher for females than males.
</P>
<P>
   Americans over 85 are the fast-growing segment of the
population, and are expected to increase from 1.6 percent of the
nation now to about 4.8 percent by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the elderly are better off today than ever. Only
10.5 percent live in poverty, compared to 35 percent 40 years ago.
The median net worth of a family headed by an elderly person
increased about 70 percent from 1984 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Older Americans are healthier, and can expect to live longer
once they reach age 65 than their predecessors. A 65-year-old today
can expect to live another 18 years. In 1900, a 65-year-old had a
life expectancy of another 12 years. The percentage of older
Americans with disabilities dropped from 24 percent to 21 percent
between 1982 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Socially, most older Americans reported being active in contacts
with friends, family and organizations. But about one-third
reported a sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the oldest of the elderly pay more for health
care than those near 65. In 1996, the average health care
expenditure _ out-of-pocket and insured _ was $5,864 for those 65
to 69, and $16,465 for those 85 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Today's elderly are far better schooled than those of a half
century ago. In 1950, less than 18 percent of the elderly had
graduated from high school, and less than 4 percent from college.
In 1998, about 67 percent were high school graduates and 15 percent
were college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, minorities and women have not done as well on most
indicators of well-being as the overall elderly population. As the
elderly population becomes more diverse, these trends will grow in
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about 84 percent of the elderly are non-Hispanic
white, 8 percent are black, and 6 percent are Hispanic. The
remaining roughly 2 percent are Asian and Pacific Islanders,
American Indians or Alaska natives.
</P>
<P>
   By 2050, whites will make up about 64 percent of the elderly
population, Hispanics 16 percent, blacks 12 percent and Asians and
Pacific Islanders will be 7 percent. The remaining less than 1
percent will be American Indians or Alaska natives.
</P>
<P>
   Women and minorities have not shared the financial success of
older men. In 1998, roughly 7 percent of elderly men lived in
poverty, compared with 13 percent of women. Among white men and
women, 8 percent lived in poverty, compared with 21 percent for
Hispanics and 26 percent for blacks.

THE WORLD IS A RADIO, AND THERE'S NO `OFF' BUTTON
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along Fifth Street in downtown Fort Worth, rows of restaurants
compete for the lunch and going-out crowds. Let's listen for a
second.
</P>
<P>
   At Reata, we hear old western tunes like ``Red River Valley''
and Marty Robbins' ``El Paso,'' which fit in with the restaurant's
cowboy decor. At the Pour House, a burgers-and-nachos sports bar,
Jewel's plaintive ballad ``You Were Meant for Me'' plays. Lionel
Richie fills the room at Schlotzky's, a quickie sandwich joint.
</P>
<P>
   The Corner Bakery is broadcasting its music outside, where all
but the rhythm track of a smooth-jazz composition gets lost in the
air. Across the street at Chili's, Phil Vassar's country song
``Carlene'' is having better luck being heard out on the street. At
Picchi-Pacchi, a pizza-by-the-slice eatery, soft-oldies station
Memories 96.7 plays. Next door at a Subway sandwich shop, generic
hip-hop competes with the noisy lunchtime crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The world has become a radio, and walking through places like
downtown Fort Worth is like hitting its scan button. It's virtually
impossible to walk into a restaurant, grocery store, clothing
store, hair salon or movie theater these days without hearing some
form of piped-in music. And not everyone's happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Griffith, a Fort Worth lawyer, is one of the people who'd
like to turn that radio off. ``I'm not alone in that it bothers
me,'' Griffith says. ``Recently at a grocery store, I had to leave
because the music was getting to me. Part of it might be the type
of music that they're playing. It's very distracting, and they may
be losing sales by distracting the customer. You might forget an
item or two that you came in for.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith certainly isn't alone, but he does seem to be in the
minority. Music has become so much a part of our lives that, unless
it's played too loud, we might not even be aware of it when we're
going about our daily activities. And unlike Griffith, some people
enjoy the incidental music, either because it resurrects old
favorites or because it introduces them to music that they might
not otherwise hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes over well,'' says Eric Tschetter, owner of the Pour
House, which subscribes to a satellite system with several
channels; Tschetter prefers to play Top 40 at night and relatively
older music during the lunch-hour rush. ``I get a lot of comments
on it. A lot of people are very excited to hear songs from the '70s
and '80s because (the songs) remind them of something in their
past.'' Tschetter says that he receives few complaints about the
music, and when he does, it's usually a request to turn the music
down or to change a channel if it's been on a while. And the
employees, he says, have no gripes about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a change for them,'' says Tschetter, who prefers the
'70s stuff himself. ``It's something they don't listen to in their
car or at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The music isn't there to entertain, however; it's there to get
you to buy, or to linger long enough to have dessert. Marketing
researchers believe that it succeeds in that mission more often
than it alienates customers. How it does it is up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   But first, a little history: The granddaddy of all the piped-in
services is Muzak, which was founded by Gen. George Squier in the
early '20s (Squier came up with the name by combining ``music''
with ``Kodak''). Muzak earned its tag as ``elevator music'' _ which
it has long since transcended _ because it was originally used to
calm nervous riders of early elevators. William Benton, who took
over Muzak in 1939, began supplying music to the workplace, saying
that it increased morale and productivity. MORE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   By the '80s, Muzak was using direct-broadcast satellite to
deliver its product, and it entered into an agreement with
Seattle-based Yesco. Muzak provided background music, or
rerecordings of songs, while Yesco delivered ``foreground'' music _
compilations of current hits, offered via satellite or by cassette.
Muzak has about 500 cassette programs and 60 satellite channels.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not your father's Muzak. Don't think of it as some
anonymous orchestra desecrating the Beatles' ``Eleanor Rigby''
while you're getting your teeth cleaned. It's often more hip than
what you hear on the radio, and you might not even be aware that
what you're hearing is Muzak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do this for some of the most unique and diverse brand names
in the world,'' says Kenny Kahn, vice president of marketing for
Muzak. ``We do this for everyone from J.C. Penney to Sally Beauty
Supply to companies right in your back yard. We do this for Armani
and Donna Karan, we do this for Gap and Old Navy and Banana
Republic, and we do this for Yahoo! and Microsoft on their hold
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn says that Muzak's products serve more than 100 million
people a day, and are in more than 300,000 stores and restaurants.
Muzak and other incidental-music services are so ubiquitous,
they've inspired a number of marketing studies, and conclusions
seem to be even more numerous and varied than the studies. Most
seem to agree that the music has a profound effect on customers;
they just don't agree on what that effect is.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pretty bummed out by the shopping experience,''
says Barbara Caplan, a partner in Yankelovich Partners, a
marketing-research and consulting firm based in Norwalk, Conn.
``Music may blur or blunt the anger and frustration that they have
when they can't find what they want or can't find someone to take
their order.''
</P>
<P>
   Or _ according to another market-researcher, James Kellaris, an
assistant professor of marketing at the University of Cincinnati _
it can blur or blunt the realization that they've been in a store a
long time. Kellaris is interested in the influence of music on time
perception, and believes that if customers like what they hear,
their sense of time shrinks and the experience becomes more
pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What fascinates me are the effects of music that are not
immediately obvious to consumers,'' Kellaris says. ``Not only is
there this temporal distortion, but music tends to lower our sales
resistance. Your brain can only process so much information at a
time, and if part of your brain is engaged in processing music,
that diminishes the capacity to resist sales influence.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it can influence consumers in another way _ it can make
them interested in the music itself. Some retailers, including
Starbucks and Pottery Barn, not only program their own music, but
have created a spinoff business by marketing their own compilation
CDs. And although a portion of the buying public wishes that
retailers would tune out and shut up, enough people are attracted
by it that the CD programs have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the response has been overwhelmingly positive,''
says Chris Gimbl, a spokesman for Seattle-based Starbucks. ``We
actually created the in-store program in 1995. We had a ton of
customers asking where they could get the music we were playing. So
we began creating the CDs in response. The first CD was done in
conjunction with (mainstream jazz label) Blue Note Records, and it
was a phenomenal success.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimbl says that what you hear piped in to Starbucks is meant to
be in sync with customers' moods. As a result, Starbucks'
programming can even appeal to foes of background music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you go into a place like Starbucks with something
different in mind, which is to relax over a cup of coffee,'' says
John Giordano, the former music director of the Fort Worth
Symphony. ``The nature of a place like that is that you're much
more aware of what you're hearing than in a place like Foley's, and
the music is part of the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But like Griffith, Giordano prefers to have some control over
what he hears. And most incidental music annoys him _ even music he
likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I have with background music is the nature
of the music that's played is often so insidious and insipid that
it's like a Chinese water torture,'' Giordano says. ``That's
predominantly in shopping centers, department stores, those kinds
of places. But restaurants often play some form of classical music.
On the one hand, I appreciate that they're playing it to provide
some form of ambience, and that they're playing good music. But I
can't stand having classical music in the background because I
start listening to it. My attention becomes drawn to it, and it
distracts me from my thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Giordano says, there's enough noise in this world.
During a phone chat, he ticks off the sounds that he hears: his air
conditioner buzzing, his refrigerator humming, outdoor sounds
creeping in. He doesn't even like using classical music in the
background at home; if he listens, he listens actively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like silence,'' he says. ``I feel silence is very
refreshing. There are so many ambient sounds in our society, there
are few places you can go to find silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith agrees, but what annoys him more is his lack of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do,'' he says. ``You can't turn it
off. Any time you're put in a situation where you can't stop the
noise, it's aggravating. I guess you could put on earmuffs all the
time to shut it out, but you shouldn't have to do that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Students in the freshman class of 2000 were born at the same
time as the original IBM &UR; 14 &LR;  PC &UR; 10 &LR; . They have never known a world
without microprocessors. They grew up with cable TV and Nintendo,
learned to program the VCR &UR; 15 &LR;  before they could ride a bike,
became virtuosos with call-waiting and three-way conference calling
and took for granted answering machines, microwave ovens, audio
CDs &UR; 16C &LR; , pagers, fax machines and cell phones. They came of age
with the Internet and the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are heading off to college, where they will be immersed
in technology more deeply than at any time of their young lives.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove that the cosmos has a sense of humor, we, their
technologically befuddled parents, are supposed to choose a
computer for these children of the technology age as they head off
to school. Here are some data points that may help.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 college students will be connected to the
Internet when school starts in a few weeks, according to Jupiter
Communications, a research firm. By the time this year's freshmen
are seniors, the number will rise to 95 percent, Jupiter says.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are actually a bit low compared with those at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where every one of the
estimated 3,500 freshmen will be required to own a laptop &UR; 17 &LR; 
computer this fall.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is unusual in both the size and ambition of its
computer program for new students, but the reasons behind its
laptop &UR; 17 &LR;  initiative could be instructive for any parent or
student who is thinking about computing strategies for the coming
school year.
</P>
<P>
   As in years past, this column strongly advises that all new
students check first with the admissions office to find out about
the school's computer recommendations. Doing so can save money,
time and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with North Carolina's decision to require students
to have not just any computer, but specifically a laptop &UR; 17 &LR;  or
notebook computer.
</P>
<P>
   Laptop &UR; 17 &LR;  computers are more expensive, less powerful, less
versatile and easier to damage and lose than desktop computers. So
why did North Carolina decide to require students to go mobile?
</P>
<P>
   ``Desktops &UR; 18 &LR;  are dead, but nobody has taken their pulse
lately,'' said Marian Moore, vice chancellor for information
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the university decided two years ago to begin the
transition to mobile computing on its campuses. ``We are absolutely
positioned to drive local wireless networks into the classrooms,
the public areas on campus, the dining halls and out into open
areas, because we know every student will have a laptop &UR; 17 &LR; ,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Going to a wireless campus gives faculty and administrators
greater flexibility in using classroom space, costs less than
trying to string wires through old buildings and enables students _
virtually the only people on campus who do not have their own
offices _ to work wherever they are, either inside or while sitting
under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is just beginning to develop its wireless network
and does not yet require students to have wireless modems for their
laptops &UR; 19 &LR; . Moving the entire student body to laptops &UR; 19 &LR;  is the
first step in the transition to campuswide &UR; 20 &LR;  wireless networking.
</P>
<P>
   Just as mobile phones are overtaking wired phones, mobile
computers will eventually overtake desktop computers for all but
specialized tasks. But wired networks are not dead yet. They will
always offer higher connection speeds than wireless networks, which
is important for such important college tasks as collaborating on
engineering projects and downloading bootleg MP3 &UR; 21 &LR;  music files.
Until wireless networks are fully deployed on campus, the
laptops &UR; 19 &LR;  can tap into the wired networks through a standard
Ethernet &UR; 22 &LR;  adapter card.
</P>
<P>
   According to Moore, 85 percent of the new students will buy
their laptops &UR; 19 &LR;  through the school. Because it buys so many
computers, North Carolina was able to negotiate substantial
discounts, as much as $800 less than the best prices available on
the Internet. (To minimize profiteering &UR; 23 &LR;  through reselling &UR; 24 &LR; ,
students and faculty can buy only one computer each year.)
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the manufacturer was IBM &UR; 14 &LR; , which makes the
highly regarded and highly priced ThinkPad &UR; 25C &LR;  line of notebooks.
There are less expensive laptops &UR; 19 &LR;  on the market, but North
Carolina decided to go for the best machines available.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you pay for,'' Moore said. ``If you're going to
make the purchase, purchase something that will last.''
</P>
<P>
   Because North Carolina has adopted only two models _ the
ThinkPad &UR; 25C &LR;  600X &UR; 26 &LR;  and ThinkPad &UR; 25C &LR;  820M &UR; 27 &LR;  laptops &UR; 19 &LR;  _ as
its standard, it can offer expedited repair, replacement parts and
loaner services right on campus. Students can rarely afford to be
without a computer for a week or more, and the standardization
allows the school to minimize downtime.
</P>
<P>
   To help make sure the computer does not drop out before the
student graduates, the discounted price at North Carolina includes
a four-year service and repair warranty, a one-year insurance
policy against damage or theft, a cable lock for securely tethering
the laptop &UR; 17 &LR;  to desks or other hard-to-move objects and a basic
package of software.
</P>
<P>
   Extended warranties are even more important for laptop &UR; 17 &LR; 
computers than they are for desktop machines. If the laptop &UR; 17 &LR; 
screen is damaged, it can cost almost as much to repair as the cost
of a new machine.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowner insurance policies will cover the loss or theft
of a child's laptop &UR; 17 &LR;  at college, but many will not. Supplemental
coverage can be added. Or consider, as North Carolina chose to do,
a company like Safeware &UR; 28 &LR;  (www &UR; 29 &LR; .safeware.com), which
specializes in coverage of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Kensington &UR; 30 &LR;  makes my favorite locking security cable for
laptops &UR; 19 &LR;  (about $40). Targus &UR; 31 &LR;  (www &UR; 29 &LR; .targus.com) has a
motion-sensing notebook alarm device called the Defcon &UR; 32 &LR;  1 ($50)
that shrieks louder than Marilyn Manson when somebody tries to
steal a laptop &UR; 17 &LR;  or backpack.

DOGFIGHT BREWING BETWEEN US REGULATORS, BAY STATE

challenge of the rules.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON _ With beady eyes, venomous spines, and a habit of biting
chunks out of living whales, the spiny dogfish was, for decades, a
trash fish _ so hated that fishermen routinely poisoned or
dynamited them.
</P>
<P>
   But like a prom queen picked from a crowd of wallflowers, the
3-foot-long shark has undergone a popularity boost in the last
decade, feeding the seemingly bottomless British appetite for fish
and chips.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in yet another sign of how heavily fished the Atlantic has
become, the lowly dogfish is at the center of one of the country's
nastiest water wars. A US District Court judge in Boston has ruled
that fishermen must severely restrict their catches, setting up a
showdown between the federal government and Massachusetts, the
nation's leading dogfishing state.
</P>
<P>
   Federal managers say the dogfish can't reproduce fast enough to
keep up with all the fishing and imposed limits on dogfishing in
all federal waters. Judge Edward F. Harrington two weeks ago
rejected the fishermen's challenge of the rules, clearing the way
for a crackdown that will hit hard in Massachusetts ports such as
Scituate, where dogfish are the top catch.
</P>
<P>
   But fishermen have vowed to appeal and Massachusetts officials
declared that, despite the court case, they plan on bucking the
limits in state waters, which extend to 3 nautical miles, with a
quota that is 11 times higher. In most cases, states closely follow
federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about overfishing too . . . and we understand
this is a highly controversial issue,'' said David Pierce, acting
assistant director for the state Division of Marine Fisheries.
``But we can rebuild and continuously harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, a Massachusetts delegation will meet with other
Atlantic states to hash out how much dogfish should be harvested in
state waters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, dogfish lovers complain of a cascading problem.
First, the seemingly endless supply of cod was exhausted. Then
scallops. Fishermen soon developed markets for so-called ``trash
fish,'' such as monkfish and dogfish, that had grown so plentiful
in part because they had been ignored. Now, even these more obscure
beasts are facing collapse. Next, say ocean specialists, could be
the skate _ a delicacy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many stocks are in bad shape,'' said Anthony Chatwin,
marine scientist at the Conservation Law Foundation, an
environmental advocacy group. According to a federal report issued
last October, New England had at least 16 stocks that were
overfished. ``Fishing stocks have been managed for years without a
vision or a strategic plan,'' said Chatwin.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there never was any plan for dogfish, which used to
illicit only groans from fishermen. Traveling in packs of
thousands, the brown and slate-gray fish would go after precious
cod and herring _ and virtually anything else: worms, lobster, and
even algae. Their name _ along with aliases skittledog, cod shark,
and thorndog _ comes from that voracious and all-encompasing
appetite.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the infamous fish have been bestowed with a
kinder name in an effort to improve its image: Cape shark.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, fishermen began chasing the dogfish as cod became
scarce. Now, roughly 55 percent of the 49 million pounds of dogfish
catches that land in the United States comes from Massachusetts.
There are three processing plants in the state, and in Plymouth,
spiny dogfish account for 96 percent of all fish landings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important industry in Massachusetts and
elsewhere,'' said Harvey Mickelson, attorney for the American
Dogfish Association. The group plans to appeal the federal
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks are at an all-time high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishery experts counter that the number of sexually mature
females has dropped. The gestation period for dogfish is unusually
long _ 22-24 months _ so killing off adult females could cause
serious problems in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fight is far from over, fishermen say they find
themselves in a familiar situation: wondering if there is another
species out there, like the dogfish, that will keep them in
business.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S FOX ON HOT SEAT OVER NEW STATE LAW PUNISHING RAPE
VICTIMS WHO SEEK ABORTIONS

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After a euphoric July victory based on pluralism
and moderation, some members of Mexican President-elect Vicente
Fox's conservative party have come under attack for hardening their
stance on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in an unanticipated move, members of Fox's National
Action Party, or PAN, in his home state of Guanajuato voted to
amend the state's criminal code to include jail time for women who
seek abortions after being raped.
</P>
<P>
   The action provoked an immediate nationwide outcry by other
political parties, women's groups and political commentators.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper cartoon showed a brutal caveman dragging a woman
by the hair, with the disembodied voice of a priest saying ``Bless
you, my son,'' as a hand sprinkled holy water over the rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Some top members of Fox's party at the national level were
stunned by their colleagues' decision in Guanajuato, and also
issued statements saying they disagreed with the action. A movement
is afoot by the PAN's opposition to reverse the initiative either
though another vote, or a veto by the current PAN governor, who
appears ambivalent about the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a devout Catholic, who, like many PAN members, doesn't
believe in abortion, which is illegal in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox has promised repeatedly to build a government of
pluralistic ideology drawing from the left to the right when he
takes office Dec. 1. He overcame accusations of being too
religious, and won the July election here with ample support from
more liberal voters who wanted to end 71 years of one-party rule by
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Guanajuato action, Fox said he has no
intention of encouraging federal or state bans on abortion in the
case of rape. He called the dispute in Guanajuato a local matter.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the PAN's federal congressional representatives and
a future senator also weighed in. ``It seems unnecessary to get
into this polemic right now, and I do not agree with the reform
that was done,'' said Carlos Medina Plascencia, who is also a
former PAN governor of Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the new law in Guanajuato said they fear others
in the PAN, which captured more state and federal congressional
seats in the last election, will pursue similar amendments on
abortion. And they say that the party and Fox have suffered damage
in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess all rapists should now come to Guanajuato. This will
be the only state in Mexico that doesn't protect victims of rape,''
said Marta Lucia Micher, a member of that state's legislature who
belongs to the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, the PRD.
</P>
<P>
   Micher and others are vowing to reverse the law, which won by
one vote on Aug. 3. If it stands, the law will be enacted on Oct. 1
and allow for between six months and three years in jail for women
who terminate a pregnancy even if they have been raped.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an added pressure on Fox he probably didn't count
on,'' said political analyst Joel Estudillo of the Mexican
Institute of Political Studies. ``He might be pressured to clarify
his position on this more. The national PAN could also be under
pressure if some sort of initiative on this reaches the federal
congressional level.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's groups that have been trying too life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the local party ``doesn't want to go back'' on its
position, but is willing to consider a range of opinions during
more debate and consider ways to avoid punishing women.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that PAN members have divergent views on what
the right to life means. The party, he added, has been flooded with
comments from citizens for and against the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've received calls from people who said they were the
product of a rape and are thankful for being born,'' Gomez said,
calling it a ``scientific fact'' that life begins at conception.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman who has been raped has to accept that this has
happened and can't be reversed,'' he said. ``But there should be
all the help and support possible offered to her so she can get
over her pain.''
</P>

   Micher, the PRD legislator, said she and other women are pr

congressional level.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's groups that have been trying to liberalize abortion law
in Mexico gathered in Guanajuato to protest the recent amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a 13-year-old girl Paulina Ramirez, who was raped
and gave birth to a baby this year in a widely publicized case, has
also made an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez lives in Baja California, a state dominated by the PAN.
Her mother charged that pro-life state authorities there confronted
and effectively blocked her daughter from having an abortion after
the rape.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Mexico's other main political parties
anajuato, the PRD and the PRI, are mustering forces to try to
reverse the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think women should be punished after being raped,''
said Guanajuato PRI legislator Ruben Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, both sides of the argument introduced rival
proposals for either overturning or modifying the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The state PAN representatives were apparently called to Mexico
City to consult with an angry national leadership on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gomez, one of the state's PAN legislators, said he and
others in the state PAN based their amendment on the party's
platform, which includes ``the right to life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the local party ``doesn't want to go back'' on its
position, but is willing to consider a range of opinions during
more debate and consider ways to avoid punishing women.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that PAN members have divergent views on what
the right to life means. The party, he added, has been flooded with

   ``A woman who has been raped has to accept that this has
happened and can't be reversed,'' he said. ``But there should be
all the help and support possible offered to her so she can get
over her pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Micher, the PRD legislator, said she and other women are
prepared to go on a hunger strike to protest the law if it is not
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents may also consider filing constitutional challenges in
Mexico's Supreme Court or with the Organization of American States,
which has a commission that reviews and sanctions human rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the PAN passed this, they told us, 'This is our
doctrine,''' Micher said. ``Come on! I'm Catholic, too. But this is
about the legal rights of women.''

 &HT;    Trio's best days are behind them
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bow your heads in respect, longtime rap fans. It's finally
happened: The hip-hop world has caught up to De La Soul. Dave,
Posdnuos and Maseo set a new standard on using samples and smart
lyrics way back in 1989 on their debut, ``3 Feet High and Rising.''
It was a remarkable precedent the band built upon with its next
three albums.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, this moves with characteristic ease from the
turntable scratch of the early '80s (``Squat'') to the Latino
infusion of today (``The Art of Getting Jumped''). But lyrically,
De La Soul has started to copy other rap acts. Hmmm. ... Puff Daddy
and Mase are dancing around in shiny suits in the ``Mo Money/Mo
Problems'' video _ oh, about two albums ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now the formerly gentle trio that was deemed rap's hippies are
teaming up with the loud (rapper Busta Rhymes on ``I.C. Y'all'')
and the profane ( rappers Xzibit and Tash &AMP; J-Ro of Tha Liks on
``My Writes''); making for a strange blend. Clearly De La Soul
isn't dead _ as they wryly declared on their 1991 CD. They've just
shown themselves to be less than we thought they were.

   Cherry pitting. We're not the only ones who admire Acme's simple
plastic pitter (at left in photo) with the cute red cherry on the
side ($4.99). Lechter's at North Point Mall is discontinuing the
fine, Italian-made stainless steel pitter from Pedrini that costs
more than twice as much, in favor of the scissorlike model, made in
China. Even children find it works easily. It's dishwasher safe,
and when cherries are out of season, you can put it to work on
olives.

 &HT;    Help us cook up ideas to make homemade family meals happen
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back-to-school time means back to busy schedules for many
families (though I know summer no longer means slow). Many will be
adjusting to new schedules, activities and adventures.
</P>
<P>
   But one old challenge is likely to persist: how to make sure
everyone eats a healthy dinner, preferably together and at home.
We've all heard the statistics. On any given day, as many as half
of us will eat one meal or more in a restaurant and another 20
percent will get takeout or delivery, according to the National
Restaurant Association.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, since parents are busy juggling jobs, shuffling
kids from one activity to another and tackling Atlanta traffic.
It's only natural to grab and go rather than chop, bake or saute.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few problems with heavy reliance on eating out:
It can be expensive and unhealthy. And it can rob the family of
important ``home time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really eating out a lot and found it was costing us
$50 to $100 a week, on top of our groceries,'' reports my friend
and co-worker Kris Jensen. Kris and his wife, Karen, a
schoolteacher, have three children: Melissa, 17; Mark, 15; and
Andrew, 13.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years back, they struck upon a solution to their
problem. They convinced Melissa to prepare weeknight family meals
in exchange for money. Now, she has a job in a department store and
has passed the spatula to Mark. Since he gets home around 3 most
afternoons, he can get a meal prepared by the time his parents get
home. He gets paid $5 for each evening's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives him responsibility, takes the pressure off Karen and
teaches him how to cook,'' says Kris. ``All of my kids can cook to
some degree. I know when they get to college, they'll be able to
feed themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mark says he enjoys the extra money, which
supports his golf habit. He sits down once a week with Karen to
compare schedules and plan menus. Mark plays trombone in the
marching and concert bands, so he is booked on some afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a main dish and some sides, but I don't really do
desserts,'' says Mark. ``My sister doesn't like some of the things
I cook, but my brother pretty much likes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Mark's greatest hits: chicken cacciatore, crunchy baked
chicken and hamburger stroganoff. And he admits that his growing
culinary portfolio sets him apart from many of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes up sometimes at school, and everyone is surprised
that I cook,'' Mark said. ``But my friends like it, and some of
them have asked their parents if they can do it to earn some money,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to hear from other families who've come up with
creative ways to prepare weeknight meals at home. Here's one of
Mark's standby recipes to add to your menu options.
</P>
<P>
   crunchy
</P>
<P>
   baked chicken
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a bowl, combine 2 cups
crushed cornflakes, 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, 2 teaspoons paprika
and salt and pepper to taste. Next, brush 4 to 6 boneless, skinless
chicken breasts with skim milk (you'll need about 4 tablespoons).
</P>
<P>
   Coat the chicken with the crumb mixture and place on a nonstick
baking pan. Dot the chicken with margarine and bake for 30-45
minutes or until done.

 &HT;    Tired of politics on TV? Try these movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Alec Guinness, who died last weekend of liver cancer, was
never one of The Triumvirate. As in, the Olivier-Gielgud-Richardson
triumvirate. And somehow that seems fitting.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness was different _ capable of the big classical roles but
more the consummate character actor. He once said, ``As far as I'm
aware, I have no personality of my own whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   He was drawn to films of all sorts _ quirky oddities as well as
epics like ``Lawrence of Arabia'' or ``Dr. Zhivago.'' Of course,
his most famous role was as the Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi in
``Star Wars.'' He reportedly got about 2 percent of the profits
from the film, but hated the role so much he convinced George Lucas
to kill off the character. ``I just couldn't go on speaking those
bloody awful, banal lines,'' he said. ``I'd had enough of the mumbo
jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   He was, quite simply, magnificent and totally unique. Here are
some video suggestions to celebrate his genius.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Bridge On The River Kwai'' (1957): Before ``Star Wars,''
this was the movie with which Guinness was immediately identified.
He plays the stiff-necked senior British officer in a Japanese POW
camp during World War II. He at first resists the demand made by
the camp's equally unyielding commander (Sessue Hayakawa) that his
men help build the titular bridge. But then in a kind of mad
embrace of a colonial we-do-things-best mentality, he becomes
obsessed with seeing the thing built. The character is both hero
and fool, a courageous fanatic who blinds himself to the fact that
he is collaborating with the enemy. He won an Oscar for the part
and it made him an international star. Yet, ironically, he was
director David Lean's third choice; both Charles Laughton and Noel
Coward turned the role down.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Lavender Hill Mob'' (1951): Guinness plays a meek Bank
of England clerk in charge of delivering gold bullion from the
refinery. This seemingly harmless fussbudget teams up with some
crooked cronies and they arrange to steal the gold in order to mold
it into souvenir miniature Eiffel Towers to export to France. The
movie won an Oscar for its clever script, but much of its success
is due to the spirited comic interplay between Guinness and fellow
thief, Stanley Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Kind Hearts and Coronets'' (1949): This black farce is a
Guinness tour-de-force. Literally. It's the story of an eccentric
English family and an ambitious young man (Dennis Price) who
decides to murder all eight of the relatives standing between him
and the family title. The twist? Guinness plays all eight of them,
including a suffragette named Lady Agatha. The actor later recalled
that initially he was asked to play only four of the victims, but
was so amused by the script that he sent a telegram saying, ``'I
see no point in playing four parts. How about me playing eight?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Great Expectations'' (1946): The film that marked both
Guinness's screen debut (not counting an appearance as an extra in
a forgettable something called ``Evensong'') and the beginning of
his long collaboration with Lean. One of the greatest adaptions of
a Dickens' novel _ of any classic book, for that matter _ it's the
tale of an orphan named Pip (played as an adult by John Mills)
whose life is shaped by a mysterious benefactor. Guinness plays
Herbert Pocket, Pip's ut's very good, but when it's bad. ... Ben
Affleck plays an ex-con who poses as his former cell mate in order
to bed babelicious Charlize Theron and gets caught in a nasty mess
with her psycho brother (Gary Sinise), who wants him to help rob a
casino. With John Frankenheimer as the director, the movie is
always watchable, but sometimes it's just plain ludicrous, as if
there were too many hands messing around in post-production. Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Here On Earth'' (PG-13) _ A limp and clueless variation on
``Love Story.'' Leelee Sobieski, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett star
as kids in a love triangle. Trapped in this hermetically sealed
setting, with a script that would run 10 minutes if the cliches
were yanked out of it, they can't win. Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bedrooms &AMP; Hallways'' (unrated) _ A sunny look at a series
of revolving bedroom doors in modern London, Rose Troche's (``Go
Fish'') comedy widens her focus, from Chicago's lesbian dating
scene to a view of sexuality (gay and straight) that's constantly
in flux. Robert Farrar's cheerfully satiric script concerns an
attractive bunch of young people whose love lives reflect the
title: sex experienced as a constant mix of journey and arrival at
a destination. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _SM
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Grandfather'' (PG) _ It's not a good sign when a movie
starts to bore you even before the actors appear, but that's the
effect of the camera's crawl through a drawing room at the start of
this Spanish film. Fernando Fernan-Gomez plays Count Don Rodrigo,
the penniless patriarch of a noble family visiting an estate that
once belonged to the family. It's now owned by former servants,
whose petty treatment of the old man reflects the film's
class-conscious, conservative politics. In Spanish with subtitles.
Grade: C

   Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. Sony. 16 tracks.

<P>
   He plays the banjo, and his music has heartland roots. But
nothing on Bela Fleck's captivating new album remotely resembles
the theme from ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' or ``Deliverance.''
Fleck's radical jazz-rock style is as far from chicken-pluck banjo
as John Coltrane's take on ``My Favorite Things'' was from the
original. In his hands, Aaron Copland's ``Hoedown'' morphs into a
jazz-inspired workout. And with such eclectic originals as the
world-party jam ``Shuba Yatra'' and Eastern-tinged ``A Moment So
Close'' (with Shawn Colvin and Jon Anderson), Beck takes obvious
pleasure in blurring the lines with his electric, acoustic and
sitar banjo. ``Outbound'' departs from the live-in-the-studio
approach of past outings, with strings and horns added for color.
But the studio craft never eclipses the spontaneity that drives the
music.

THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO SING THE BLUES, AND A REASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 By DANA JENNINGS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do white women sing the blues?
</P>
<P>
   It's grueling work to peer over the broad shoulders of old
masters like Son House, Robert Johnson and Howlin' Wolf. It's
anonymous work, too, to play an African-American music that evolved
in the Mississippi Delta and then hoboed the Illinois Central north
to Chicago, where it got electrified and citified. The blues were
the birthright of a tribe of wronged, restless black men. They
belonged to a dirt-road world of mule work and shotgun shacks, to
sharecroppers who in their bosses' eyes were still just a
commodity, the Emancipation Proclamation be damned.
</P>
<P>
   How can a white, middle-class woman in the year 2000 inhabit _
and be inhabited by _ a music forged in that hateful crucible? Yet
it happens, enriching the culture.
</P>
<P>
   Women, for all their apparent gains, still grapple with the
prospect of marginal lives, with the commodification of their
spirit, their bodies. Isn't Britney Spears just a singing toy
marketed by jaded and cynical men? It's one of our culture's deep
secrets, but women are still second-class citizens, more readily
accepted when heeled to pornographic submission and so often
vilified at any hint of ambition. Consider the persistent attacks
on Hillary Clinton's image.
</P>
<P>
   Every move a black man makes in our society is still freighted
with levels of meaning. Every move a woman makes carries freight,
too. To get along in our white-male-dominated culture (I'll
confess: I'm a 42-year-old white man) blacks and women must be
subtler, be quick studies _ and that's a blues attitude. Women,
too, must know how to work from the fringes, where the blues were
born _ born not just on the margins of culture, but on the margins
of black culture.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mississippi bluesman R.L. Burnside said in an interview
last year: ``The way people was treated back in those olden days,
that's what the blues is all about. Working for the man, you
couldn't say nothing, but you could sing about it, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of white women searching for Robert Johnson:
the singers Angela Strehli and Lou Ann Barton; the boogie piano
players Marcia Ball and Deanna Bogart; the singer-guitarists Rory
Block, Joanna Connor, Debbie Davies, Sue Foley and Susan Tedeschi;
and blowing harp, Annie Raines.
</P>
<P>
   The question why is uncomfortable because often what the
questioner means is: ``What are you doing singing the blues? You're
not black.''
</P>
<P>
   Block says, ``It's not your skin, it's your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Popular music offers hard lessons in exploitation. The music
industry has always been racist and sexist, with a history of
taking advantage of blacks and women. And the current tone of
popular music, oozing over-the-top sex and violence, feels more and
more like pro wrestling with a soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   So, a white woman singing the blues _ who won't sell her body
(or her soul) to MTV _ is a defiant, admirable figure. But the
blues have always been opposition music, singing the blues a
celebration of outlaw culture. Squeaky-voiced pseudo-vixens with
hyperactive breasts need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that white women have a right to the blues, but
some stumble at the roadblock between the blues and the merely
bluesy. (Sorry, but Bonnie Raitt is only bluesy. ) It's the
difference between the fire and the firefly, between Little Richard
and Pat Boone As the late Muddy Waters once said, ``Ain't too many
left that play the real deep blues.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are juke joints of the soul where the would-be
blueswoman must work hard and honest to get past the spiritual
bouncer. Rory Block, Sue Foley and Susan Tedeschi are three who've
done that.
</P>
<P>
   Block, born in Princeton, N.J., and raised in New York City,
says that as a young woman ``I thought about nothing but blues,
dreamed, loved, breathed and ate blues.''
</P>
<P>
   On her two most recent albums, ``Confessions of a Blues Singer''
and ``Gone Woman Blues,'' Block covers bluesmen like Robert
Johnson, Son House (whom she knew), Charley Patton and Blind Willie
McTell. Her playing is perfect, her singing otherworldly as she
wrestles with ghosts, shadows and legends. ``I still don't think
there is anything as glorious and beautiful as an old blues or
country song,'' Block writes in the liner notes to ``Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Her wrestling with these 78 rpm blues is almost as beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   As America's rural past vanishes, becomes varnished by
theme-park revisionism, the blues face the same questions of
authenticity as modern country music. (Most current country singers
are just SUVs wearing cowboy hats.) But to play the deep blues,
does a player need to be born to fish fries and knife-on-the-frets
Saturday nights? Tedeschi doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can relate the blues to anything that hurts you deeply,''
she said in an interview. ``I don't think you have to go out in the
cotton fields anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The blues have always reserved the right to change, to meet the
player's needs, the culture's. The Texas blues differ from
Mississippi's. As do the blues from Chicago, New Orleans, the
Piedmont. There are spiritual geographies, too; there's plenty of
room for the white woman's blues.
</P>
<P>
   But if on some gray days those middle-class blues don't feel
quite right, there's still new, raw blues by old black men from
Mississippi like R.L. Burnside, T-Model Ford and Robert Belfour.
These men and their brethren still play true blues so stripped down
that you can see the bondo between the notes. When T-Model Ford
rasps, ``I've been shot, and I've been cut,'' the hair bristles on
the neck of the listener, who doesn't doubt Ford for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ford, too many performers, black and white, male and
female, want to slick up the music, to snip the barbwire of the
blues.
</P>
<P>
   For Sue Foley, the blues are very much alive. At 16, she sang
Memphis Minnie moaners in Ottawa bars. That was a year after
hearing James Cotton blow his harp live. ``I never had experienced
something so real and human,'' Foley said in a recent interview on
the ``It's a Girl Thang'' Web site. ``So down to earth, my entire
soul was lifted.'' On her latest album, ``Love Comin' Down,''
Foley's got that blues feeling to complement her strong guitar. No
question, she has those old Ottawa Delta blues on this fine, swampy
album.
</P>
<P>
   And Tedeschi, currently touring with B.B. King and Buddy Guy,
devoured her father's Lightnin' Hopkins and Mississippi John Hurt
records growing up in Norwell, Mass., and never shook the blues
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Tedeschi learned a few lessons. The opening of ``Rock Me
Right,'' the first song on her 1998 album ``Just Won't Burn,'' is
one of the most riveting moments in recent recorded blues. When she
howls, ``You say you haven't been rocked in a long, long time,''
it's the vocal equivalent of a hopped-up '64 Chevy Impala peeling
out on a dirt road, spitting rocks and gravel. Someone paid
attention, because she was nominated for a Grammy for best new
artist, shocking Tedeschi, who didn't seem to fit in with the other
nominees: Britney Spears, Christine Aguilera, Macy Gray and that
legendary bluesman Kid Rock.
</P>
<P>
   So, why do white women sing the blues?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the female Clarence (Gatemouth) Brown,'' Foley
says, explaining that she wants to be 75, a wicked guitarist ``and
ornery as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   T-Model Ford would understand.

 &HT;    Hip sippers drive growth of water sales
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some people, it's as necessary as a cell phone. It's right
at home in the cup holders of sport-utility vehicles. And before
you even get to the wine list in an upscale restaurant, you're
likely to be confronted with the choice of still or sparkling, Fiji
Islands or France.
</P>
<P>
   It's bottled water, the elixir of our times. We're willing to
pay as much as 40 cents a glass for it, even though the free stuff
is still flowing from the faucet.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's simply a matter of taste. Others are drawn to the
convenience of portable water. Some think it's safer than tap. And
yet others simply want to sip with the hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in the business in 1988, the concept of buying
bottled water was fairly foreign,'' said Kevin McClanahan,
president and chief executive officer of Fountainhead Water Co.,
based in Marietta. ``Now it's gone from rare to all the rage. There
are more than 600 brands, and it's the fastest-growing beverage in
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, overall sales of bottled water jumped about 13
percent from 1998, topping 4 billion gallons in the United States.
Though sales trail soft drinks and beer, bottled water has seen a
59 percent increase from five years ago, according to various
industry reports.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket News polled grocery stores and found that most are
giving more shelf space to bottled water, and Restaurant Business
has been tracking double-digit annual increases in restaurant sales
of bottled water for the past several years. Restaurants are
finding that having servers suggest one-liter bottles is an easy
way to increase check totals by $5 and up.
</P>
<P>
   At New York's Rainbow Grill, a one-liter bottle of water can set
you back $12. In Atlanta, the going price is around $5 a liter. At
Seeger's, diners don't have a choice; bottled water is the only
kind offered. But at other restaurants such as BluePointe, Nava,
Floataway Cafe and Bacchanalia, servers make a point of offering
bottled or tap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of people who are fine with tap, who think
it's silly to pay for water,'' said Matt Lutsey, the maitre d' at
BluePointe, which serves Fiji and San Pellegrino bottled waters.
``But other diners don't want plain, ordinary tap water.''
</P>
<P>
   Health concerns
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Gigliotti, chef of Grappa, said bottled water is very
popular at her restaurant. ``I think people are suspicious of how
tap water is filtered, and they don't like the chlorine.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the incidents of contaminated tap water are very rare.
Both tap and bottled water are regulated and must meet limits for
contaminants set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A recent state audit of Georgia's public water systems found
that 95 percent had no reported violations of federal standards
during the past four years. (Some groups, such as the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, say the rules aren't tough enough.)
Consumer Reports magazine recently tested 39 bottled waters and
seven municipal sources, and all fell within current limits.
</P>
<P>
   Safety aside, health is a concern for bottled-water drinkers,
said Lisa McCue, spokeswoman for the Grocery Manufacturers of
America. And while most of us are well aware that drinking water is
good for us, ``it has never been so accessible before,'' said
McCue, who believes portability is driving the trend. ``It's in
convenience stores, at the gym, at the grocery. And when it comes
to drinking in the car, there's nothing easier.''
</P>
<P>
   McClanahan agrees. ``Consumers are recognizing that every time
they have a bottle of water, that's 8 to 10 ounces less of
caffeine, sugar and preservatives they get in other beverages,'' he
said. ``And the easiest way to get it is to grab a bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting for attention
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of Atlantans conducted by Yankelovich Partners
of New York showed convenience (51 percent) as the strongest reason
Atlantans drink bottled water, followed by taste (46 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Reason enough to pay anywhere from 75 cents to $5 for a product
that otherwise is virtually free. And now more than ever, consumers
have their choice of brands. They range from smaller producers such
as Fountainhead, which bottles spring water from a protected source
in North Carolina, to beverage giant Coca-Cola, which bottles
purified municipal water under the name Dasani. And flavored waters
are making a splash, too. (For an explanation of the types of
bottled water, see the glossary below.)
</P>
<P>
   That means bottlers are doing more than ever to get customers'
attention. Labels with cool mountain scenes are big, even if the
water isn't from a mountain source. Pepsi's Aquafina bottles show
mountain peaks on the label, even though the water is purified tap
water. Fountainhead goes with a light blue, ridged plastic bottle
in a tapered shape, to set it apart from clear, smooth plastic
bottles. Ty Nant water from Wales (sold locally at Star Provisions)
offers a cobalt blue glass bottle that's so popular in Britain that
the International Herald Tribune reports many folks refill them
with tap water just to keep the bottles around. Ty Nant reportedly
has red bottles in the works.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort put into the type of bottle isn't all about
looks. The material a bottle is made from can greatly affect the
taste. Water in clear, strong plastic usually tastes better than
water from plastic gallon jugs similar to milk jugs. Glass is most
neutral but least practical.
</P>
<P>
   Bottled water is trickling into vending markets. Pepsi offers
its Aquafina brand in vending machines across from Turner Field,
among other locations. The ever-growing availability means the
upward trend is likely to continue, McCue said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just something not classy about drinking water out of
the tap anymore,'' she said. ``Bottled water looks better, so
refreshing.''

   WATER GLOSSARY
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of Atlantans showed convenience (51 percent) as
the strongest reason Atlantans drink bottled water,
</P>
<P>
   followed by taste (46 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Not all bottled waters are the same, with the key difference
being the source. Here's a breakdown of the types of bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spring water _ Comes from an underground formation and must
flow naturally to the earth's surface. Water is collected at the
spring or through a hole that taps the source. The source must be
stated on the label. Spring water is typically protected from
microorganisms sometimes found in surface water. Carbon dioxide can
be added to make it ``sparkling.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mineral water _ Typically spring water. Can be sparkling or
still, but contains at least 250 parts per million of dissolved
solids such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, silica and
bicarbonates.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Naturally sparkling water _ Usually comes from a spring and is
naturally carbonated; bubbles lost during treatment or collection
may be replaced with the same amount of carbon dioxide the water
held originally.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Purified drinking water _ Comes from any source, usually tap
water, and has been processed by reverse osmosis, distillation
(boiling) or similar procedures that remove minerals and
contaminants. The process can remove fluoride, too. All bottled
waters lack fluoride, so frequent drinkers may need fluoride
supplements, especially children.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Soda water or seltzer _ Not considered bottled water by the
Food and Drug Administration; regulated instead as a soft drink,
under rules that are less strict. Some products have added sugar,
flavors or salts. (Read the label.) They're usually carbonated tap
water, sometimes with extra filtration.
</P>
<P>
   Source: Consumer Reports, August 2000
</P>
<P>
   Resources for learning more about the taste and safety of
drinking water are abundant.
</P>
<P>
   The August issue of Consumer Reports gives the results of their
taste and safety tests of 39 bottled waters. The October, 1999
issue of Consumer Reports reviewed faucet-mounted and carafe water
filters.
</P>
<P>
   The June issue of the Nutrition Action Health Letter, published
by The Center for Science in the Public Interest, (www.cspinet.org)
takes a look at the safety of drinking water. It also include the
following info on how to find out what's in your tap water:
</P>
<P>
   ``The first place to start is with your local public water
utility. Ask for the most recent ``Consumer Confidence Report.''
This report should tell you where your water comes from, whether
it's surface water (from rivers and lakes), ground water (from
underground rivers, streams, etc.) or some mix. It will also tell
you whether your water exceeds the limits for any of the 80
contaminants that are regulated by the Environmental Protection
Agency. You should also ask for a printout of the levels of all 80
contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   If you get your water from a well, you'll need to get it tested
yourself. Call the EPA Safe Drinking Hotline (1-800-426-4791) for
information on how to obtain a list of certified labs.''
</P>
<P>
   For bottled water, check out the website of the International
Bottled Water Association (www.bottledwater.org). This site offers
some of the nitty gritty about bottling, safety and consumption and
it's member companies are open for unannounced inspections by the
NSF International, a water and food safety monitoring company.
Visit www.nsf.org to see their latest reports.
</P>
<P>
   We also like www.bottledwaterweb.com, which gives excellent
direction for staging your own water taste test, based on the
annual Berkeley Springs taste test.

 &HT;    Summer salads
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer is salad season. When heat and humidity put a crimp on
appetites and you don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen,
a main dish salad is a healthful, tasty and creative way to get
dinner on the table.
</P>
<P>
   With supermarkets and roadside stands overflowing with
wonderful, fresh produce, summer is also the time to take a
breather from the iceberg lettuce, tomato and cucumber drenched in
bottled dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you think your pantry pickings are spare, chances are
that if you look behind this and under that, you will find the
makings of a knock-out summer salad.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have rice? Some kind of pasta? A potato or some lentils?
Surely your cupboard will yield cans of beans, corn, diced
tomatoes, salmon or tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Now check your freezer. Is it possible you have a couple of
sausages wrapped up in there or _ joy of joys _ maybe some frozen
shrimp?
</P>
<P>
   Now the fridge. Is there a bell pepper, a zucchini, a carrot or
squash hidden in the vegetable bin? Any packages of cheese lying
around?
</P>
<P>
   If you have any of these ingredients, just add a little
creativity and you are on your way to a tasteful, cool and easy
summer meal.
</P>
<P>
   Check out these sites for loads of summer salad ideas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lundburg Gourmet Brown Rice at
www.lundberg.com/recipes/ssalad.html has put together a number of
salad recipes using rice and other everyday pantry items and
spices. Cumin, cilantro, black beans, corn, peppers, tomatoes and a
mild salsa combine with rice to make a salad with a Southwestern
flair. Sun-dried tomatoes, olives, olive oil, balsamic vinegar,
parmesan cheese, rosemary, basil and lemon juice inspire a
Mediterranean dish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Surprising color and taste combinations are the order of the

<P>
   Your pantry may yield the makings of the unusual Tropical Tomato
Salad that combines diced tomatoes, pineapple, hearts of palm,
green onions, blue cheese and olives _ a combo that goes especially
well with grilled chicken. Other colorful entries include an
unusual combination of blueberries, cherry tomatoes, olive oil and
balsamic vinegar. What about green beans and julienned beets or
sweet potatoes and canned green chilies?

</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup thinly sliced carrots
</P>
<P>
   1 sweet pepper (red, yellow, green, or purple), cored, seeded
and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound large cooked shrimp, optional
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped fresh dill leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons balsamic or red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon crushed dried oregano leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, toss together the cooked pasta, snow
peas, cauliflower, carrots, sweet pepper, green onion, shrimp (if
using) and dill until well combined.
</P>
<P>
   To make the dressing: Combine garlic, vinegar, lemon juice,
sugar, oregano, salt and pepper in a food processor or mixing bowl.
While processing or whisking, add water and oil slowly, mif
``Cookwise'' (Morrow, 1997). ``You know things won't get any hotter
than 212 degrees because water evaporates after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Corriher also points out that we wouldn't have bread without
water, because it links the two proteins in gluten. And for many
recipes, water is preferred over stock or wine because it lets the
flavors of the food shine through.
</P>
<P>
   Bittman, in an essay for Amazon.com, points out that a touch of
water can help balance the oil and vinegar in a basic vinaigrette.
If you make the vinaigrette in a blender, water will help create a
creamy consistency. All this with no added fat.

   A very old dish from the peasant cuisine, ``cooked water''
perseveres more for its goodness than out of necessity. It's the
essence of simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds ripe tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   4 onions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   8 fresh mint or basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   6 slices Tuscan or other rustic bread, whole-wheat
</P>
<P>
   if possible, several days old
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Pepper
</P>
<P>
   Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
</P>
<P>
   Cut the tomatoes in half and squeeze out the seeds. Roughly chop
the tomatoes and place them in a saucepan over medium heat with
barely enough water to cover; bring just to a boil, lower heat to a
simmer and cook until the tomatoes are broken down and the liquid
has begun to thicken, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the onions, mint and a pinch of salt, partially cover the
pot and continue to simmer until the ingredients resemble a sauce
of medium consistency, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If the bread is not quite stale, lay the slices on a baking
sheet and place in a 350-degree oven to dry, but not to toast.
Place a slice in each of six soup plates and drizzle the olive oil
over; season with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the thickness of
the soup if necessary with small amounts of water and ladle over
the bread. Sprinkle cheese over each portion or pass it at the
table. _ From ``Yesterday's Bread'' by Carole Lalli

<P>
   10 ears sweet corn
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   5 strips bacon, diced

   1 large chipotle chile (or canned chiles in adobo sauce)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a hot grill. Lightly coat the ears of corn with the oil,
place on the grill and cook, turning frequently, until most of the
kernels are dark brown. Remove kernels from the cob, cutting close
to the cob so as to remove as much of the starch in the cob as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   In a large Dutch oven or stockpot over medium-high heat, combine
the bacon and onion and cook, stirring constantly, until the bacon
is browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add cumin and cook for another 1 to 2
minutes. Add the corn, water and chipotle and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to maintain a slow boil and cook for 1 hour, stirring
occasionally. Puree the soup in batches on high speed of a blender
or in a food processor, and strain through a medium sieve. Season
with salt and lime juice and serve at once.

&HT;     NADER CAMPAIGN AD ATTACKS DONATIONS TO MAJOR PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ZACHARY COILE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader
is spoofing MasterCard commercials by claiming his bid to expose
corporate contributions to the major political parties is
``priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second Nader ad, made by the Minneapolis firm that
produced zany ads that boosted Jesse Ventura's successful bid to be
Minnesota governor in 1998, is airing this week in Los Angeles, New
York, San Francisco, Seattle and other major markets.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial pokes fun at Republican George W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore for accepting millions in special interest
donations, and concludes with a plea to include Nader in the
presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   The ad begins to the tune of ``Hail to the Chief'' and shows
news clips of Bush and Gore attending campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: $1,000-a-plate,'' an
announcer says in a voice-over. ``Campaign ads filled with
half-truths: $10 million. Promises to special interest groups: over
$10 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the camera pans to Nader sifting through documents at a
desk. ``Finding out the truth: Priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial concludes with a montage of images of Nader over
the years as the announcer repeats the MasterCard slogan, ``There
are some things money can't buy.'' The announcer then
editorializes: ``Without Ralph Nader in the presidential debates,
the truth will come in last.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad is the work of Minneapolis-based North Woods Advertising.
The firm created some of the most memorable commercials from
Ventura's race, including one featuring the former wrestler posed
like Rodin's famous statue of ``The Thinker,'' and another showing
an action figure of Ventura refusing campaign donations from ``evil
special interests man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hillsman, who produced the Nader spot, said the ad aimed to
get voters to pressure officials into allowing Nader into the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates has refused to allow
Nader and the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan in the nationally
televised debates unless they can each win above 15 percent support
in national polls. In recent national polls, Nader registered about
5 percent and Buchanan much less.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people find out what's going on, they literally and
viscerally get angry,'' Hillsman said. ``We're trying to get them
to go to the Web site to find out more about this arbitrary
situation where the two parties have decided to shut out third
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillsman would not specify the cost of the advertisement, except
to say, ``It's more than $100,000 and less than $5 million.'' The
commercials began running Sunday on cable and network TV.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in Philadelphia during the Republican National
Convention, Nader denounced the GOP and Democratic conventions as
corporate-paid ``political orgies.'' He said at the time that the
national political conventions exclude most working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political carnival where the political powers shake
down the corporations and the corporations buy future political
favors,'' Nader said of the GOP convention, adding that it would be
the ``same in Los Angeles'' where the Democrats hold their
nominating convention beginning Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown Nader gaining among liberal Democrats and
environmentalists, especially in key Western and Midwestern states.
He has picked up support from rank-and-file members of organized
labor who are upset over the Clinton administration's support for
normalized trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party hopes to have Nader on the ballot in 45 states
by election day, Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, best known as a consumer advocate who in the 1960s
tangled with General Motors over auto safety and later took on the
nursing home industry, ran a hapless campaign for president in
1996, registering less than 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But this time he says he is serious. The campaign has
organizations on 600 campuses and plans to add 400 more this fall.
He said the campaign has raised more than $1 million and that he
has visited all 50 states.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Students in the freshman class of 2000 were born at the same
time as the original IBM PC. They have never known a world without
microprocessors. They grew up with cable TV and Nintendo, learned
to program the VCR before they could ride a bike, became virtuosos
with call-waiting and three-way conference calling and took for
granted answering machines, microwave ovens, audio CDs, pagers, fax
machines and cell phones. They came of age with the Internet and
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are heading off to college, where they will be immersed
in technology more deeply than at any time of their young lives.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove that the cosmos has a sense of humor, we, their
technologically befuddled parents, are supposed to choose a
computer for these children of the technology age as they head off
to school. Here are some data points that may help.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 college students will be connected to the
Internet when school starts in a few weeks, according to Jupiter
Communications, a research firm. By the time this year's freshmen
are seniors, the number will rise to 95 percent, Jupiter says.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are actually a bit low compared with those at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where every one of the
estimated 3,500 freshmen will be required to own a laptop computer
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is unusual in both the size and ambition of its
computer program for new students, but the reasons behind its
laptop initiative could be instructive for any parent or student
who is thinking about computing strategies for the coming school
year.
</P>
<P>
   As in years past, this column strongly advises that all new
students check first with the admissions office to find out about
the school's computer recommendations. Doing so can save money,
time and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with North Carolina's decision to require students
to have not just any computer, but specifically a laptop or
notebook computer.
</P>
<P>
   Laptop computers are more expensive, less powerful, less
versatile and easier to damage and lose than desktop computers. So
why did North Carolina decide to require students to go mobile?
</P>
<P>
   ``Desktops are dead, but nobody has taken their pulse lately,''
said Marian Moore, vice chancellor for information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the university decided two years ago to begin the
transition to mobile computing on its campuses. ``We are absolutely
positioned to drive local wireless networks into the classrooms,
the public areas on campus, the dining halls and out into open
areas, because we know every student will have a laptop,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Going to a wireless campus gives faculty and administrators
greater flexibility in using classroom space, costs less than
trying to string wires through old buildings and enables students _
virtually the only people on campus who do not have their own
offices _ to work wherever they are, either inside or while sitting
under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is just beginning to develop its wireless network
and does not yet require students to have wireless modems for their
laptops. Moving the entire student body to laptops is the first
step in the transition to campuswide wireless networking.
</P>
<P>
   Just as mobile phones are overtaking wired phones, mobile
computers will eventually overtake desktop computers for all but
specialized tasks. But wired networks are not dead yet. They will
always offer higher connection speeds than wireless networks, which
is important for such important college tasks as collaborating on
engineering projects and downloading bootleg MP3 music files. Until
wireless networks are fully deployed on campus, the laptops can tap
into the wired networks through a standard Ethernet adapter card.
</P>
<P>
   According to Moore, 85 percent of the new students will buy
their laptops through the school. Because it buys so many
computers, North Carolina was able to negotiate substantial
discounts, as much as $800 less than the best prices available on
the Internet. (To minimize profiteering through reselling, students
and faculty can buy only one computer each year.)
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the manufacturer was IBM, which makes the highly
regarded and highly priced ThinkPad line of notebooks. There are
less expensive laptops on the market, but North Carolina decided to
go for the best machines available.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you pay for,'' Moore said. ``If you're going to
make the purchase, purchase something that will last.''
</P>
<P>
   Because North Carolina has adopted only two models _ the
ThinkPad 600X and ThinkPad 820M laptops _ as its standard, it can
offer expedited repair, replacement parts and loaner services right
on campus. Students can rarely afford to be without a computer for
a week or more, and the standardization allows the school to
minimize downtime.
</P>
<P>
   To help make sure the computer does not drop out before the
student graduates, the discounted price at North Carolina includes
a four-year service and repair warranty, a one-year insurance
policy against damage or theft, a cable lock for securely tethering
the laptop to desks or other hard-to-move objects and a basic
package of software.
</P>
<P>
   Extended warranties are even more important for laptop computers
than they are for desktop machines. If the laptop screen is
damaged, it can cost almost as much to repair as the cost of a new
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowner insurance policies will cover the loss or theft
of a child's laptop at college, but many will not. Supplemental
coverage can be added. Or consider, as North Carolina chose to do,
a company like Safeware (www.safeware.com), which specializes in
coverage of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Kensington makes my favorite locking security cable for laptops
(about $40). Targus (www.targus.com) has a motion-sensing notebook
alarm device called the Defcon 1 ($50) that shrieks louder than
Marilyn Manson when somebody tries to steal a laptop or backpack.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Even with the discounts, the ThinkPad 820M package will cost
$2,200; the 600X package, $2,900. ``You can't expect to require a
kid to come to school with technology like that without some
financial aid commitment,'' Moore said. Depending on their
financial status, some students will get laptops free, while others
will get loans from the school. She said the money the school
spends on financial aid would be offset by the money it saves by
making the transition from wired to wireless buildings on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, all new students get a two-hour computer orientation to
learn how to tap into the school's network, use e-mail and
otherwise master the system.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story in Chapel Hill. Most undergraduate schools stop
short of making computer ownership a requirement, as North Carolina
does, and simply urge students to have their own PC's. Many
colleges make computers accessible in libraries and study centers
for students who cannot afford to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are shopping for a desktop system, ``this is
actually one of the best times in the last few years to buy a
computer,'' said Stephen Baker, vice president of technology
products research at PC Data in Reston, Va. ``Prices aren't exactly
collapsing, in fact they're pretty flat from last year, but the
consumer is getting a lot more for the same amount of money. We're
seeing bigger hard drives, better and faster processors and
preinstalled CD-RW drives.''
</P>
<P>
   Big hard drives and CD-RW drives are vitally important for
managing large volumes of MP3 music files. (Yes, I know, there is
more to college than downloading Napster files. Dude, whatever.)
When shopping for a computer that will be used far from home, it is
valuable to know which brands have the best reputations for
reliability, service and support. Each year PC Magazine asks
thousands of readers to rate their desktop and laptop computers and
printers on the basis of reliability and service satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's survey, published in June, the only desktop
computer maker to get an A grade from readers was Dell. The lowest
scores went to Acer, AST, Compaq and Packard Bell. Packard Bell has
always been the class clown in terms of service and reliability,
but Compaq's low score was surprising.
</P>
<P>
   In the notebook computer category the grading was tougher: No
company scored an A. The highest scores, all B's, went to Dell, IBM
and Gateway. Again, Compaq scored a surprising D. In the printer
category, PC Magazine readers gave A grades to Panasonic and
Hewlett-Packard. Epson got a B. Canon got a D for its relatively
weak support, and Tektronix a D for frequency of repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Handheld organizers like the Palms, Handspring Visor, HP Jornada
and Compaq iPaq are not replacements for a desktop or laptop
computer at school, but they can be useful for keeping track of
assignments and taking notes, especially when equipped with a
folding keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   And for extra credit, students, remember to turn off your cell
phones before entering class.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was just another day in the life of the Reform
Party. With no agreed candidate to run for president, much less a
running mate or a platform of agreed policy, the party's two
seemingly irreconcilable factions shouted at each other, swung
their fists and, when the police came to break up the fight,
marched off in different directions threatening lawsuits and all
manner of more intimate forms of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   That was Tuesday. Thursday, at least in theory, the party that
once hoped to become the force that would break the
Democrat-Republican duopoly in American politics opens its national
convention in Long Beach, Calif., in an atmosphere of blood-baying
anticipation more commonly associated with prize fights than with
political coronations.
</P>
<P>
   In the blue corner stands Pat Buchanan, erstwhile scourge of the
Republican Party, virulent free-trader, and hero to America's white
supremacists, Jewish conspiracy theorists, anti-abortionists and
prayer-breakfast isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   He has the advantage of national prominence, the crucial support
of the Reform Party's chairman, Gerald Moan, and a majority _
albeit a contested majority _ of the party's national committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the red corner, meanwhile, is the altogether less pugnacious
figure of John Hagelin, a libertarian quantum physicist with a
penchant for transcendental meditation.
</P>
<P>
   He is the hastily presented alternative to Buchanan, ardently
championed by those members of the Reform Party who want nothing to
do with neo-Nazis or Christian fundamentalists and who remain true
to the secular, reformist agenda of their founder, the Texas
billionaire Ross Perot.

   LOS ANGELES _ It was just another day in the life of the Reform
Party. With no agreed candidate to run for president, much less a
running mate or a platform of agreed policy, the party's two
seemingly irreconcilable factions shouted at each other, swung
their fists and, when the police came to break up the fight,
marched off in different directions threatening lawsuits and all
manner of more intimate forms of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   That was Tuesday. Thursday, at least in theory, the party that
once hoped to become the force that would break the
Democrat-Republican duopoly in American politics opens its national
convention in Long Beach, Calif., in an atmosphere of blood-baying
anticipation more commonly associated with prize fights than with
political coronations.
</P>
<P>
   In the blue corner stands Pat Buchanan, erstwhile scourge of the
Republican Party, virulent free-trader, and hero to America's white
supremacists, Jewish conspiracy theorists, anti-abortionists and
prayer-breakfast isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   He has the advantage of national prominence, the crucial support
of the Reform Party's chairman, Gerald Moan, and a majority _
albeit a contested majority _ of the party's national committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the red corner, meanwhile, is the altogether less pugnacious
figure of John Hagelin, a libertarian quantum physicist with a
penchant for transcendental meditation.
</P>
<P>
   He is the hastily presented alternative to Buchanan, ardently
championed by those members of the Reform Party who want nothing to
do with neo-Nazis or Christian fundamentalists and who remain true
to the secular, reformist agenda of their founder, the Texas
billionaire Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   To say the two sides have no common ground is an understatement.
Reform Party politics have come to resemble the schisms of the

CHOOSING QUICK HITS OVER THE CARD CATALOG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ohio, Texas, Calif., Mich., Ind., N.J.)  (See also CIR-TEACHING-SOFTWARE, CIR-DORMS-COMPUTERS,

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sam Vanderpol, a 15-year-old sophomore at Newton North High
School in the Boston suburb of Newton, has trouble with his
homework, he often turns to the Web for answers. ``I tried to use
the Web for math once because I had forgotten a formula,'' he said.
``But I couldn't find the right sites.'' After an hour and a half,
he gave up.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Web doesn't always deliver, Sam still prefers
doing research with his Hewlett-Packard PC to looking up
information at the library. ``I'd much rather be online,'' he said.
The library, he added, is ``a tenser atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   For students like Sam who grew up with the Web, the idea of
roaming library stacks is as quaint as the thought of writing with
a quill pen. Even though libraries are organized and easily
navigated, students prefer diving into the chaotic whirl of the Web
to find information.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with this strategy is that many students are not
well versed in advanced searching techniques so a simple search
for, say, information about the planet Saturn can yield tens of
thousands of hits. Yet students persevere with this hit-or-miss
approach, saying that they are simply more comfortable sifting
through hyperlinks than they are flipping through a card catalog.
And they admit that using the Web requires less exertion.
</P>
<P>
   But while the keyword approach to searching makes perfect sense
to teen-agers, it troubles many educators, who fear that
point-and-click research can lead to lazy study habits and
ineffective searches. When the Internet emerged, educators had to
teach their students how to determine the authenticity of a site.
Now they have to teach students how to refine their searches _ and
when to look offline for certain kinds of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have an idea when they come into the library that
everything they need is on the Internet,'' said Mary Arnold,
president of the Young Adult Library Services Association and a
librarian at the Cuyahoga County Public Library near Cleveland.
``That may be true, but they often don't know how to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Geraci, a Harris Interactive vice president who oversees
online polls that look at how young people use the Internet, said
that students with access to a home computer prefer to use that
computer for research and schoolwork, instead of using computers at
a library. That tends to isolate them from the professionals who
could help them learn how to narrow their searches. ``They are not
in the same environment that they used to be in to do research
because there are no librarians or teachers around,'' Geraci said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Sara Sutherland, a 14-year-old freshman at
Alamo Heights High School in San Antonio, needs to find information
on the Internet, the first thing she does is type in keywords, even
if it's not the most efficient approach. ``I click on the first
link and try to find the information,'' she said. ``If I don't find
it, I just keep going. It's `guess and chuck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Older students do not seem to fare much better. Ellen Meltzer,
head of the teaching library at the University of California at
Berkeley, said that students wanted information quickly but were
dealing with a large library system that could be complicated to
navigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students don't know about controlled vocabulary or Boolean
logic,'' Meltzer said. ``They want to punch in three keywords and
be done. We need to teach them what to do when they get 1,000 hits.
Which hits should they look at? How should they use a site after
they find it? We try to teach kids how to be critical thinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of researchers led by Professor Eliot Soloway at the
University of Michigan's School of Education recently studied the
way students approach Web searches. ``Kids think there is one
answer, and they look for the Web site with that answer,'' said
Soloway, who does both computer science and education research.
``We try to explain that they have to get information from multiple
Web sites. We tell them to ask open, deep, interesting questions.
For example, `How many moons does Jupiter have?' is not an
interesting question. But `What makes a volcano stop erupting?'
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan project has developed tools to help students with
their searches. ``We found that students would use a big search
engine like Infoseek or Yahoo, and then get an overwhelming number
of responses,'' said Barry Fishman, an assistant professor of
educational technology at Michigan. ``They would react by either
saying, `OK, I found a lot of answers _ I'll take the first
couple,' or they would be so overwhelmed with too many hits and
wouldn't know how to refine the search.'' About 60 professors,
librarians and graduate and undergraduate students worked on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   One tool developed at Michigan is Artemis (named for the goddess
of the hunt), which is being used in a half-dozen school districts
around the country. Artemis, which is designed for science-related
searches, has a built-in dictionary and thesaurus because
researchers noticed that students often misspelled their search
terms and did not know synonyms for the terms they were searching
for. For example, many students know what photosynthesis is, but in
the age of computer spelling checkers, they do not know how to
write it. Artemis also lets students look at their past searches
and lets them recommend helpful sites to other students.
</P>
<P>
   Some students say the scale of the Internet is much less
intimidating than the size of a library.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the library there are all these books on topics that won't
help you at all,'' Sam Vanderpol said. ``You have to skim them. But
on the Internet you get a brief description, and you know what
you're going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly the kind of attitude that make some educators
worry that students will use the Internet as a quick fix. ``What
kids need is to learn how to concentrate, how to practice, how to
exert effort toward a goal,'' said Diane Ravitch, a historian of
education at New York University and author of the new book ``Left
Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster).
``Learning a musical instrument is far likelier to produce those
habits and behaviors than surfing the Net. The Internet encourages
browsing, jumping around, surfing, sampling _ much like clicking
the dial for TV but with millions of unfiltered choices. It does
not and cannot teach concentration, effort or stick-to-itiveness.''

 ART ADV: With graphic showing growing number of obsolete computers 
 By TREVOR MAXWELL  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The profusion of computers in American life has produced a toxic
problem: a mounting stockpile of outdated equipment containing
millions of pounds of lead and other dangerous substances for which
there are few disposal sites and recycling plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two decades, an estimated 175 million computer sets
in the United States have been tucked into warehouses and
residential basements and attics. Contained in those computers are
roughly 650 million pounds of lead, 987,000 pounds of cadmium,
231,000 pounds of mercury and more than 2 billion pounds of
plastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend a lot of money on this technology, and they can't
bear to throw it away when it's obsolete,'' said Bill Bree of
Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality. ``A lot of people
have one or two machines tucked away somewhere. Those are the ones
an organized program should be able to make available for reuse or
recycling.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for those collected by a handful of recovery efforts
nationwide mainly serving large industries, the computers that do
leave storage end up in public and private landfills designed for
trash. There, these components release toxic substances and mix
with liquids that in some cases leach into soils and threaten
ground water.
</P>
<P>
   Solid waste planners estimate that 30 percent to 40 percent of
lead in municipal landfills comes from computers and other
electronic equipment. Lead is widely known to cause central nervous
system disorders and interfere with the neurologic development of
children.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulation of dead and out-of-use computers is dizzying.
The number of PCs in use has jumped nearly 150 percent since 1992,
to 164 million units nationwide, according to the Computer Industry
Almanac. In that same period, however, the expected lifespan of a
PC has been cut in half, from more than four years to about two.
This rush to obsolescence rapidly multiplies the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Obsolete computer systems have nearly doubled in number since
1997. Last year, 24 million computers in the United States were
retired, yet only 3.3 million were recycled, a National Safety
Council report shows. The ``missing'' 20.7 million sets?
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in storage, mainly. Others go to the landfill or
incinerators -- or are shipped to foreign markets for dumping or
stripping down for the reuse of certain parts, federal officials
and industry specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer users are unaware of the toxic contents of their
PCs.
</P>
<P>
   A standard display monitor contains from 4 to 8 pounds of lead,
which lines the glass cathode ray tube, or CRT, as a user shield
against radiation. A 1999 University of Florida study classifies
most standard monitors as hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts this year became the first state to ban CRTs from
landfills. Other states and cities, particularly in the East where
landfills are filling rapidly, are considering similar actions.
</P>
<P>
   Minute amounts of mercury, a highly toxic and environmentally
persistent metal, appear in a computer's printed wiring boards,
switches, relays and batteries. Cadmium compounds, metals suspected
as persistent carcinogens, appear in a computer's batteries, wiring
boards and plastic stabilizers. And plastics, the computer's No. 1
ingredient, are pesky: They typically have little value yet require
difficult separation for an expensive recycling process that is
itself toxic.
</P>
<P>
   All of these things mix with a landfill's more traditional
garbage stew, altering the landfill's leachate, or pungent liquid,
that either drains into a collection system or the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The National Safety Council sees a clear, ominous trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still no real infrastructure for collecting and
disseminating equipment,'' says Bud Ward, executive director of the
council's Environmental Health Center. ``The big companies have
asset recovery programs established, but what about the smaller
businesses and households?''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Quantum Resource Recovery, based in Beaverton, Ore., handles
cast-off electronic materials for Intel, Fujitsu and Tektronics,
among other companies. Quantum is one of the few recyclers in the
United States that will accept individual PCs free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Mike Wenzinger said the growing company has held computer
collection days, coordinated with local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Eugene, we took in 23,000 pounds of equipment in four
hours, and that's only on a two-week notification,'' Wenzinger
said. ``The next week we had a bunch of calls asking when we were
going to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   But such days are rare. If someone wants to properly dispose of
a PC now, it's almost always up to that person to find a private
recycler and pay a fee. That's started to change in at least one
Oregon venue. The Marion County Department of Solid Waste
Management this summer teamed with Computer Drive Connection Inc.,
a Cornelius recycler, and allowed free drop-offs at its
Salem-Keizer Recycling and Transfer site. In just three weeks, a
30-yard container was filled with PC parts.
</P>
<P>
   Similar programs in Seattle and Minneapolis have experienced
overwhelming responses.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The electronics recycling industry is new and small; it lacks
the capacity and support to handle the growing computer stockpile.
And its priorities are not always the same as those who would
supply it.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce costs, computer manufacturers are using fewer precious
metals and more plastics, making recycling more difficult and
expensive. And the profusion of lead-heavy monitors poses the
biggest and toughest recycling challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Doe Run Co. of St. Louis, Mo., operates the nation's only
two primary lead smelters handling glass from computer monitors.
Doe Run's environmental specialist, Cliff Asberry, is blunt on the
subject of CRTs:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming if it's not coming to me, or going to
glass-to-glass recyclers or overseas, it's going to landfills. I'm
bringing in a lot of glass, but the smelters can only use so much
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls every week from people looking to get into the
recycling business. But people don't realize the environmental
sides to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirms the problem
but is beset by loopholes in regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waste stream itself has been growing significantly,'' says
Michael Shapiro, an EPA deputy assistant administrator in
Washington, D.C. ``Our feeling is that there is much more that
could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA now requires large producers of electronic waste -- an
industry discarding 80 computers, for example, after purchasing
more powerful machines -- to meet standards for handling,
distributing or recycling the cast-offs.
</P>
<P>
   But a residential exemption in EPA's rules applies to those
discarding less than 220 pounds of computer monitors monthly. That,
it turns out, applies to most small businesses, exempting them from
recycling requirements.
</P>
<P>
   It also means household users in most states can take their
outmoded machines to the dump or landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling industry representatives say the EPA's rules are
inconsistent, not well understood and often intentionally broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience is that the commercial sector either does not
know or is ignoring any regulations regarding electronics,'' said a
Michigan recycler, Greg Heynen, during a National Recycling
Coalition roundtable discussion. ``I spoke to someone ... who
landfilled a whole trailer of electronics and (monitors). ... Many
just don't want to pay and would rather sneak it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even responsible businesses struggle to find proper disposal
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk, information technology manager with United Companies
Financial in Baton Rouge, La., found it impossible to give away 800
Pentium PCs for which the company had once paid top dollar. The
machines sat in storage for six months before Kirk sold some to
employees and the rest went to recycling intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to donate them, but they didn't meet the school
system's criteria, and at that time, most of the liquidators in the
Southeast didn't want any more equipment,'' Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   Frances O'Brien, an asset analyst with the Gartner Group in
Stamford, Conn., advises companies to plan for electronics
obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem that just snuck up on people,'' O'Brien
said. ``I have clients that have old equipment in warehouses
because they can't find outlets for it. The situation came on fast,
and very few have plans on how to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Donation has been a popular option for companies and individuals
seeking to unload computer gear. But donation, while sometimes good
in the short term, transfers disposal responsibility to
organizations that do not have adequate resources, some critics
say.
</P>
<P>
   An emerging debate addresses manufacturer responsibility.
Michael Dell of Dell Computers has publicly discussed computer
recovery as a mounting problem, and IBM and Hewlett-Packard are
credited with making strides toward recoverability. But at this
point no one -- manufacturer, local government or federal agency --
wants to be stuck with the entire bill for end-of-life
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Until gathering and recycling systems are in place for the
nation's computer stockpile, landfills -- and the water tables they
sometimes affect -- remain vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition has tracked the problem at
the heart of the nation's chip-producing center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more ground-water pollution in the Silicon Valley
than anywhere else in the country,'' said Ted Smith, the
coalition's executive director. Smith's organization tracks
recycling issues and has pushed for increased manufacturer
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some companies that are clearly trying to do the
right thing,'' Smith said. ``But they are so good at what they do,
so powerful and so prolific, that they never have time to
anticipate the unintended consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer stockpile is growing faster than any solution.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002 in the United States alone, more than 50 million
computers will become obsolete annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be a real temptation to feed them into
landfills,'' said Ward, of the safety council. ``There is no
question that there are a lot of heavy metals that pose a toxicity
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those in industry who tend to minimize the environmental
concerns on toxicity still have to confront the quantity issue.''

 ART ADV: With graphic showing growing number of obsolete computers 
 By TREVOR MAXWELL  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The profusion of computers in American life has produced a toxic
problem: a mounting stockpile of outdated equipment containing
millions of pounds of lead and other dangerous substances for which
there are few disposal sites and recycling plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two decades, an estimated 175 million computer sets
in the United States have been tucked into warehouses and
residential basements and attics. Contained in those computers are
roughly 650 million pounds of lead, 987,000 pounds of cadmium,
231,000 pounds of mercury and more than 2 billion pounds of
plastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend a lot of money on this technology, and they can't
bear to throw it away when it's obsolete,'' said Bill Bree of
Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality. ``A lot of people
have one or two machines tucked away somewhere. Those are the ones
an organized program should be able to make available for reuse or
recycling.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for those collected by a handful of recovery efforts
nationwide mainly serving large industries, the computers that do
leave storage end up in public and private landfills designed for

<P>
   But browsing is not always a bad thing, said Robert McClintock,
co-director of the Institute for Learning Technologies at Columbia
University Teachers College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students now engage in free-form browsing,'' he said. ``Part
of the fascination of surfing the Web is that the same kind of
serendipitous discovery that can be found in the library builds up
there.'' McClintock added that one of the benefits of the Web was
that it saved students so much time. ``You don't have to spend a
half-hour on a bus to get to the library and then find out the book
isn't there,'' he said. McClintock also noted that the instant
gratification of the Web helped students sustain interest in their
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect my students to use books, but to ignore the Web is
crazy,'' said Donald J. Cunningham, director of the Center for
Research on Learning and Technology at Indiana University. ``If a
student is doing a report on Alexander Graham Bell and is using the
card catalog, he might run across something interesting. But in the
library, often you study things in isolation. On the Web, people
come across more sides of the topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one is calling for the removal of the Internet
from the classroom. Even if information is sometimes hard to find,
many teachers say, the Internet increases a student's enthusiasm
for research.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take a kid and show them 10 volumes of books they might
want to look at for a research project, their eyes glaze over,''
said Bobbie McDonnell, the Internet librarian at Phillips Academy
in Andover, Mass. Yet with the Web, she has seen students go beyond
the confines of a research project _ some students even form e-mail
relationships with the experts or professors whose research they
are using.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rogers, who has been a middle school history teacher at the
Buckingham Browne and Nichols School in Cambridge, Mass., for 26
years, said that learning alongside his students could be
gratifying and bewildering. ``The Internet has turned teaching
upside down,'' he said. ``I've got students a third my age who know
way more than I do about the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said it was still hard for him to believe that all the
physical skills involved in doing a research paper, like searching
heavy guides to periodicals and the card catalog, are becoming
anachronistic. But he is optimistic that his students are learning
just as much as they did in the days before the Web. ``As the word
processor created better writing,'' he said, ``I think the Internet
will create deeper, better research.''
</P>
<P>
   But books still have their place. When Jared Goldberg, a
13-year-old eighth grader from Montclair, N.J., began working on a
research paper about the naval hero John Paul Jones, his Web
searches yielded dozens of links. Some led him to detailed,
fact-heavy information from several naval museums. Others were the
personal home pages of naval enthusiasts. But Jared found
conflicting information on some Web sites. To organize and
double-check the online information he collected, Jared took a trip
to the library and consulted some actual books. ``I think I could
have written the report with just the Web,'' he said. ``But I'm not
sure how good it would have been.''

   RMEICH, SOUTHERN LEBANON _ At last. The Lebanese army moved
through the streets of southern Lebanon's stony villages Wednesday
while U.N. peacekeepers looked down from their new observation
posts on the Lebanese-Israeli frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Given the smartly-dressed Lebanese troopers in their gleaming
Land Rovers, the military police in their dark green armor and the
paramilitary lads in their grey and black camouflage, it was almost
possible to forget that it was all the wrong way around.
</P>
<P>
   For the United Nations was originally supposed to be in the
towns and the Lebanese army _ so far as the U.N.'s brains were
concerned _ on the border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the United Nations sits on the ``blue line''
shoulder-to-shoulder with the Israelis while the Lebanese soldiers
settle into their new billets to the north.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200 of them _ half from the formerly occupied area in
the south _ had taken over the Lebanese Technical High School at
Bint Jbeil Wednesday, sipping bottled water by the sports ground or
driving their vehicles through the little hill villages of Rmeich
and Ein Ebel.
</P>
<P>
   On U.N. paper, it all looks fine. Secretary General Kofi Annan's
special U.N. envoy, Terje Roede-Larsen, arranged for the 600 U.N.
soldiers to be posted to the frontier in order to prove that Israel
really had withdrawn from all Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government had insisted upon this step. But just a
few weeks ago, before Roede-Larsen _ one of the supposedly heroic
architects of the deeply flawed Oslo agreement between Palestinians
and Israelis _ turned up in Beirut, the boot was on the other foot.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was insisting on a peacekeeping deployment
within the former occupied zone, but with Lebanese troops on the
border. If the Lebanese did not accept this, then the United
Nations planned to pull out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As one old U.N. hand in New York put it to me Wednesday over the
phone: ``We were ready to fulfill the mandate _ which is to
`establish peace and security' in the area which the Israelis have
vacated. But we've now allowed the Lebanese _ who should be on the
border _ to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in the towns where we are meant to be. We are on the
frontier where they are meant to be. Larsen screwed it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   Which appears to be true. The U.N. soldiers on the ``blue line''
_ running along the old Palestine-Lebanon frontier _ are now tasked
to be ``observers''; something they were never supposed to be under
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978 which followed
Israel's first invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Lebanese army's duty to defend the frontier of Lebanon
_ just as it is the Israeli army's job to defend Israel. Now
Roede-Larsen has effectively given that impossible and unmandated
mission _ to ``defend'' both countries _ to about 600 U.N.
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Junior U.N. officers on the ground are not supposed to talk to
journalists, but ``cover-up'' was the least unpleasant of the
epithets one of them Wednesday had to say about the United Nations
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we do on the border?'' he asked. ``UNIFIL (the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) can't stop infiltrations or
attacks in either direction. We don't have the arms or the mandate.
But now we're going to be blamed for everything that goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Lebanese are delighted at the new scenario.
Their soldiers sit snugly in the newly-``liberated'' towns of
southern Lebanon while the United Nations take the stick.
</P>
<P>
   In Marjayoun, the Lebanese authorities took back the old army
barracks in the Christian town for the first time in 22 years. &QL;

   RMEICH, SOUTHERN LEBANON _ At last. The Lebanese army moved
through the streets of southern Lebanon's stony villages Wednesday
while U.N. peacekeepers looked down from their new observation
posts on the Lebanese-Israeli frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Given the smartly-dressed Lebanese troopers in their gleaming
Land Rovers, the military police in their dark green armor and the
paramilitary lads in their grey and black camouflage, it was almost
possible to forget that it was all the wrong way around.
</P>
<P>
   For the United Nations was originally supposed to be in the
towns and the Lebanese army _ so far as the U.N.'s brains were
concerned _ on the border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the United Nations sits on the ``blue line''
shoulder-to-shoulder with the Israelis while the Lebanese soldiers
settle into their new billets to the north.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200 of them _ half from the formerly occupied area in
the south _ had taken over the Lebanese Technical High School at
Bint Jbeil Wednesday, sipping bottled water by the sports ground or
driving their vehicles through the little hill villages of Rmeich
and Ein Ebel.
</P>
<P>
   On U.N. paper, it all looks fine. Secretary General Kofi Annan's
special U.N. envoy, Terje Roede-Larsen, arranged for the 600 U.N.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A full decade after the Gulf War, the West is still
searching for a way of getting rid of Saddam Hussein and the
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons facilities it believes he
is continuing to develop.
</P>
<P>
   It was 9 p.m. Washington time on the evening of Aug. 1, 1990,
when a startled Dick Cheney _ now Republican vice-presidential
candidate, then defense secretary in the Bush Administration _ was
phoned at home by an aide to be told that Iraqi tank columns had
crossed the Kuwaiti border at dawn and were racing, unopposed,
towards Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
   The American response was to send an army of half a million men
half way around the world, and seven months later a U.S.-led
coalition liberated Kuwait and routed Saddam's forces, after a
ground campaign lasting barely 100 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently complete victory gradually turned into a
stalemate which persists to this day.
</P>
<P>
   At least three times in the intervening years, allied aircraft
have launched major air attacks, the last Operation Desert Fox in
December 1998. Since when U.S. and British warplanes have carried
out strikes against Iraqi targets roughly every other day.
</P>
<P>
   No-fly zones have been imposed in the north and south of the
country. Stringent United Nations sanctions have been in force
since the invasion and with varying success U.N. arms inspectors
have sought to garner information on Saddam's weapons of mass
destruction programs. But to scant avail.
</P>
<P>
   As the years have passed, the original Gulf coalition has
crumbled, and deep splits have emerged among the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, pitting Britain and the U.S.
against Russia, China and, increasingly often, France.
</P>
<P>
   Though crippled by sanctions, Iraq is starting to edge out of
its international isolation. Several Gulf states _ though not
Kuwait _ have resumed ties, while 80 countries will be represented
at the forthcoming Baghdad trade fair.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday saw the restoration of rail links between Iraq and
its former sworn enemy Syria, for the first time in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   But if others wobble, amid mounting international unease at the
humanitarian crisis which the blockade has helped bring about, the
U.S. and Britain are adamant that sanctions must stay until Iraq
has stopped trying to build chemical, nuclear and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still evidence of all three of them,'' senior Foreign
Office diplomats said last week. ``We expect Saddam to carry on
seeking to improve bilateral relations with as many countries as
possible, and to sow new discord among the Western allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's bait is primarily economic, the prospects of rich
contracts for the country's reconstruction to be paid for out of
sharply increased oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But the real crunch will come in a few weeks, with the possible
return of the first U.N. arms inspectors since the departure of the
last such mission, UNSCOM, in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In late July Hans Blix, the Swedish diplomat who leads the
latest team, called UNMOVIC, said it would be ready to start work
at the end of August. It remains to be seen whether Iraq will allow
them in.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer Westerners in its ranks, the new body is reckoned
more acceptable to Saddam. Though ``Blix will be firm,'' in the
words of a British official, the mandate of the new team contains
more carrots as well as sticks, notably a more clearly mapped path
towards the lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far Iraq has said it will have no truck with UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
   The West now waits to see whether that is mere bluff, or a
reflection of Saddam's belief that the sanctions dam, already
leaking, may soon collapse _ perhaps when a new president enters
the White House next January. &QL;

<P>
   TEHRAN _ Hassan Safir was finishing the grave of his son, in the
hot Tehran afternoon. Mohamed Ali Safir died in 1986, at the age of
18. But his father has only just buried him.
</P>
<P>
   They found his body last year: he was one of ``the Lost,'' those
who died in the war with Iraq and whose bodies were not recovered.
They are still finding bodies, even though the war ended twelve
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs of every Iranian city, there is a rose garden:
the Garden of Martyrs. Here, you can understand why it is so hard
for Iran to make peace with the United States _ as Washington,
encouraged by the reforms of President Mohamed Khatami, has been
signalling it would like to.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Ali Safir is buried in the garden in Tehran. You can see
his photograph there, one among thousands that stretch in every
direction _ pictures of those who died in the war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are more poignant than any memorial could be. In
some, the dead are shy before the camera. In others, they stare at
it directly, proud in their new uniforms, smiling before they set
off for death. Often, they are teenagers, sometimes even children.
Occasionally, there is the veiled face of a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives, tending the graves of their dead, remain bitter
towards the United States for its perceived role in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't start the war,'' says Hassan Safir, over the newly
dug grave of his son, draped with the red banners of martyrdom.
``Iraq invaded us. And who gave them the weapons? America, England,
NATO. They gave the chemical weapons to Iraq,'' he says. ``The
chemical weapons that were used on our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evident who is to blame for the war: America,'' says
Mohsen Kheirabadi, repairing the grave of his brother, Naghi.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 300,000 Iranians died in the war. It was the
defining experience for an entire generation of Iranians _ and
everybody here believes the United States started it, by
encouraging Iraq to invade in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The war brings out a passion that unites Iran's hard-liners and
reformers. Hossein Shariatrazavi voted for Khatami, but beside the
grave of his brother, Ali Reza, the patriot in him gets the better
of the reformer.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that Iran is united, that reformers and hard-liners
are struggling together for the Islamic Revolution. ``It was the
enemies of Islam who started the war with Iraq,'' he says. ``And
the leader of them is America.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday was the tenth anniversary of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, which led to the Gulf War. But the bombardment of Baghdad
by American jets did nothing to change the view of people here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Iraq is weak they are doing everything they can
against Iraq,'' smiles Safir. ``Countries like America are just
arming the small countries against each other.'' All around Safir
stretch the pictures of the dead, killed in a war Iranians blame
the U.S. for starting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the old man insists peace with America is possible. ``We're
not against America,'' he insists. ``We're just against their
hostile policies. If there was mutual respect between us, there
would be no problem. But we will not let them destroy Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Even here, amongst all this wasted youth, Safir is not bitter at
his son's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could all go the same way,'' he says, gazing at the
photograph of his son. ``We believe the martyrs died for us, for
our country, for Islam. Even now, if the country was in danger, I
have more children. I can give them.''
</P>
<P>
   His son cannot tell if he believes it was worth while dying,
probably in agony, at the age of 18. &QL;

   TEHRAN _ Hassan Safir was finishing the grave of his son, in the
hot Tehran afternoon. Mohamed Ali Safir died in 1986, at the age of
18. But his father has only just buried him.
</P>
<P>
   They found his body last year: he was one of ``the Lost,'' those
who died in the war with Iraq and whose bodies were not recovered.
They are still finding bodies, even though the war ended twelve
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs of every Iranian city, there is a rose garden:
the Garden of Martyrs. Here, you can understand why it is so hard
for Iran to make peace with the United States _ as Washington,
encouraged by the reforms of President Mohamed Khatami, has been
signalling it would like to.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Ali Safir is buried in the garden in Tehran. You can see
his photograph there, one among thousands that stretch in every
direction _ pictures of those who died in the war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are more poignant than any memorial could be. In
some, the dead are shy before the camera. In others, they stare at
it directly, proud in their new uniforms, smiling before they set
off for death. Often, they are teenagers, sometimes even children.
Occasionally, there is the veiled face of a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives, tending the graves of their dead, remain bitter
towards the United States for its perceived role in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't start the war,'' says Hassan Safir, over the newly
dug grave of his son, draped with the red banners of martyrdom.
``Iraq invaded us. And who gave them the weapons? America, England,
NATO. They gave the chemical weapons to Iraq,'' he says. ``The
chemical weapons that were used on our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evident who is to blame for the war: America,'' says
Mohsen Kheirabadi, repairing the grave of his brother, Naghi.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 300,000 Iranians died in the war. It was the
defining experience for an entire generation of Iranians _ and
everybody here believes the United States started it, by
encouraging Iraq to invade in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The war brings out a passion that unites Iran's hard-liners and
reformers. Hossein Shariatrazavi voted for Khatami, but beside the
grave of his brother, Ali Reza, the patriot in him gets the better
of the reformer.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that Iran is united, that reformers and hard-liners
are struggling together for the Islamic Revolution. ``It was the
enemies of Islam who started the war with Iraq,'' he says. ``And
the leader of them is America.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday was the tenth anniversary of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, which led to the Gulf War. But the bombardment of Baghdad
by American jets did nothing to change the view of people here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Iraq is weak they are doing everything they can
against Iraq,'' smiles Safir. ``Countries like America are just
arming the small countries against each other.'' All around Safir
stretch the pictures of the dead, killed in a war Iranians blame
the U.S. for starting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the old man insists peace with America is possible. ``We're
not against America,'' he insists. ``We're just against their
hostile policies. If there was mutual respect between us, there
would be no problem. But we will not let them destroy Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Even here, amongst all this wasted youth, Safir is not bitter at
his son's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could all go the same way,'' he says, gazing at the
photograph of his son. ``We believe the martyrs died for us, for
our country, for Islam. Even now, if the country was in danger, I
have more children. I can give them.''
</P>
<P>
   His son cannot tell if he believes it was worth while dying,
probably in agony, at the age of 18. &QL;

IS EMINEM FOR REAL OR PLAYING A CHARACTER? DO WE REALLY WANT TO
KNOW?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DAVE FERMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eminem is pop music's bad boy du jour, the guy who jokes about
enlisting his daughter's help in killing her mom, the guy who
bashes gays and jokes about how much dope his mother did when he
was a kid. He disses 'N Sync, Britney Spears, Will Smith and
Christina Aguilera, and he makes no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, there is nobody hotter in music _ Eminem's second
CD, ``The Marshall Mathers LP'' (Mathers is his real name), has
sold more than 5 million copies in two months and has been atop the
national CD charts since its release _ and nobody whose life looks
more out of control. On June 4, police say, he pointed a gun at
Douglas Dali of Insane Clown Posse; the next day, he reportedly
pistol-whipped a man who kissed his wife, Kim, in a parking lot.
Both men are pressing charges.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem is also being sued for $10 million by his mom, Debbie
Mathers-Briggs, for saying on his breakthrough 1999 hit ``My Name
Is'' that she ``does more dope than I do.'' More recently, he's
been sharply criticized by gay organizations for his frequent
gay-bashing on the ``Marshall Mathers'' CD, and has earned the
wrath of many women for songs such as ``Kim,'' a brutal fantasy in
which he kills his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The night the current Up In Smoke Tour played his hometown of
Detroit, Kim attempted suicide by slashing her wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by CDs and tickets sold, however, Eminem has become a
bona-fide hero to disaffected American youth who quite simply don't
want to be told what to do and who want to live vicariously through
the anger smoldering in his songs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there's no disputing his talent as a rapper: Everyone
from mentor Dr. Dre to hip-hop bible ``Vibe'' magazine to gospel
superstar Kirk Franklin notes his skills on the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   If you hate him, there's no shortage of reasons. ``Marshall
Mathers'' is a series of obscenity-filled outrages that find Eminem
lashing out against everything and everyone.
</P>
<P>
   His life, in other words, is a vortex of court dates, sold-out
arenas, travel, intense pressure and scrutiny. Everyone wants a
piece of Eminem _ or is it Slim Shady (his evil alter ego) or
Marshall Mathers, the troubled kid who was raised by a single mom
in poor inner-city Detroit, dropped out of school in the ninth
grade and was, until recently, a fry-cook?
</P>
<P>
   He might be any one of the three in a given song, thereby
honoring the timeless legacy of singers assuming personae in their
work, according to Alan Light, editor of ``Spin,'' which had Eminem
on the cover of its August issue. Light calls Eminem's playing of
various characters ``slippery but legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tradition of rock 'n' roll but it's also part of the
dialogue in hip-hop _ rappers will defend problematic lyrics by
saying the kids understand the difference in `me' and the person
onstage,'' Light says. ``You don't think Clint Eastwood is a bad
guy because he killed people in a movie. Why can't recording
artists and their audiences receive the same respect, that they can
tell the difference between storytelling and a documentary? In `Cop
Killer,' Ice-T used the voice of a character, like a fiction writer
would.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no, says David Cross, an associate professor of
psychology at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. He says
that although many children and teens can distinguish fact from
fiction and characters from real people, those from less-stable
homes may not have that ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones at risk are the ones whose home life is congruent
with the message in the media,'' Cross said. ``The behaviors they
see modeled in the media are consistent with behaviors modeled in
their environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's use of characterization can be seen as license to say
anything you want, no matter how volatile, and then hide behind the
character. The message is: ``Hey, lighten up _ that's not the real
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Light is right: U2's Bono, Johnny Cash, Mick Jagger and numerous
country, folk and blues singers _ all have assumed characters in
their songs.
</P>
<P>
   But with Eminem, it gets a bit hazier. Take ``Kim.'' Marshall
Mathers is married to a woman named Kim, and there's no question it
is a volatile relationship; he has ``Kim: Rot in Pieces'' tattooed
on his stomach. But when he fights with her and kills her in the
song, is it Marshall Mathers doing it? Slim Shady? Neither? Will
life imitate art someday?
</P>
<P>
   In this way, too, Eminem is part of a long line of rappers and
rockers who set themselves outside the mainstream to become
weathervanes for their era. From Bob Dylan to the Rolling Stones to
Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young to the MC5 to any number of punk
rockers to Public Enemy and N.W.A, there have always been
performers that lambasted racism or the government or a war or
violent police, and sometimes advocated anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to right wrongs and/or protesting those who abuse
authority has become a trademark of rock and rap _ at times its
most useful role in society.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem has earned his outsider/rebel status by making women and
gays his major targets. These two groups have traditionally been
abused by heterosexual men. MORE: &QL;

UNDATED: by heterosexual men. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One could make the argument that this is cowardly. Members of
several gay-rights organizations, including the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation, have said as much.
</P>
<P>
   Or is Eminem pouring out a lifetime of rage and frustration in a
cathartic spew that's a source of relief and release for him and
his listeners?
</P>
<P>
   After all, part of what makes Eminem compelling to so many
people is that they can see themselves in him. Young couples in
volatile relationships, young men with slim prospects, teens with
access to firearms _ these are parts of the real world for
thousands of people growing up in America nowadays. For them,
Eminem/Slim/Marshall is lampooning their darkest feelings while
displaying his own foibles and insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   He's the flip side to Britney Spears' living-Barbie-doll looks
and cute, frothy little songs about teen-age crushes and dealing
with boys _ and it's no coincidence that both have sold just about
the same number of CDs in just about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Light notes, it's harder to be a rebel these days _ and
easier to be a delinquent quasi-rock star. America is involved in
no major conflicts, the economy is booming, there's a computer in
every house and a new SUV in every garage _ what's a homeboy to do?
Rap about how slow his modem is?
</P>
<P>
   Rock and rap stars are celebrating their wealth and success in
gaudy, sometimes sleazy ways that are reminiscent of the
hedonistic, drug-soaked '60s and '70s: huge pieces of jewelry, furs
(favored by Puff Daddy and Kid Rock), extravagant parties,
champagne, blocklong cars, the best dope, strippers, porn-star
girlfriends. They want you to know they're living large _ even as
they flip the world off.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface are ugly realities that reach into the
lives of people who have never met Eminem and yet take his music
and message seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say he's the cause of abuse cases, but he foments
an atmosphere that says that you can do these things, that this is
how to treat women,'' says a member of the Tarrant County Task
Force on Family Violence, which serves North Texas. The woman spoke
on condition of anonymity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She points to a recent case in which a young woman was trying to
get a protective order against her abusive ex-boyfriend. The
boyfriend often called up and play Eminem's notorious ``97' Bonnie
&AMP; Clyde,'' the song in which the narrator enlists the help of his
young daughter to dispose of the child's mother in a lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would play this song in the background and say, `Listen to
this _ I'll get you,' '' she says. ``It was just like when O.J.
Simpson was on trial. I had women who wanted to break up with men
and the guy would say, `I'm gonna pull an O.J. on you _ you just
wait.' This says to me that Eminem has a lot of influence on a
certain segment of the population _ young people. Many of them
haven't had that many life experiences and are more
impressionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross adds that these more vulnerable youths have not seen good
examples of how to deal with other people in their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two salient phenomena we see,'' he says. ``The
Columbine thing, or gang-related behavior. When I hear about a
12-year-old kid becoming an assassin, my bet is that his home life
wasn't good, and he wasn't being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empathy comes from healthy relationships _ it's a major
preventative. If the child is in an environment where there's not
much empathy, they're more likely to act out on a media message.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's first CD sold around 3 million copies _ at day's end,
the new one could do three times that, even if its sales level off
in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody's suggesting he's responsible for the actions
of every person who listens to his music. No recording artist is;
as Tom Petty noted long ago, you can't worry about the dumbest
members of your audience and what your music may lead them to do.
</P>
<P>
   In Eminem's case, though, there seems to be a fine line between
life and art, between fantasy and reality _ and sometimes no line
at all. That's what makes him worrisome to so many people _ and so
popular to millions more. Does he, as a result, deserve to be hated
or pitied? Or both?
</P>
<P>
   You decide. As noted, Marshall Mathers _ whoever he is _ isn't
going to apologize. &QL;

&HT;     POPE BRINGS PRIDE, POSE TO RAIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. _ Marquez Pope aspires to more than just being a
member of the 2000 Oakland Raiders. He wants to be one of their
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I here?'' Pope asked rhetorically. ``I love to play the
game. I have a passion about the game. In my California journey,
I'm here with the Raiders now. I'm happy. I'm very excited. I feel
and think I can bring a lot to this team. Through performance. And
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Since this is Pope's first training camp with the Raiders, his
goal to become a team leader might seem somewhat presumptuous.
After all, aren't new guys in the locker room supposed to keep a
low profile, at least for a while?
</P>
<P>
   Pope does not intend to rally his teammates with rousing
speeches. That is not his style. He believes if he goes out and
does his job every day, demonstrates that it can be done with
maximum effort and concentration, then it will inspire the men
around him to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's doing it,'' Pope explained. ``It's showing poise.
Being relaxed and comfortable with yourself. And understanding that
there are obstacles that occur, but training yourself to say if I'm
in this situation do I panic or do I calm down? It takes calm. You
have to be very calm and relaxed through life. You don't rush. You
work through things and just make sure it's done right.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrien Gordon has been around Pope long enough already to see
that his new teammate can be a positive influence on the field and
in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just doing what he's already been doing,'' Gordon said. ``Come
in with the professionalism he has, the work ethic, the playmaking
ability. Guys see that. Guys respect that. Him coming in and doing
the kind of things he's done his whole career. That's going to put
him into a leadership role.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Gordon's eighth year, and he figures to have a
leadership role. Eric Allen, beginning his 13th season, definitely
does. Then there are Tim Brown and Steve Wisniewski, the senior
members of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   `It appears as if this job already has been filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to win a championship,'' Gordon said. ``Think
about the dynasties the 49ers had, the Cowboys had, even the
Broncos. There's any number of guys you can point to for leadership
on those teams. Of course, there's going to be one or two that
everybody points to. Here it's probably Tim Brown and Steve
Wisniewski. But there's so many other guys, so many veterans, like
Eric Allen, who are leaders. You can never have enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope doesn't have to be introduced to football fans in the San
Francisco Bay Area. He played four years with the 49ers and also
has suited up for the Chargers and Rams. He spent last season in
Cleveland, was unhappy there and asked to be released. He knew
immediately where he wanted to work next.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders coach Jon ``Gruden and I had talked last year,'' Pope
said. ``I felt this would be the best place. He liked my style of
play and understood the type of person that I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a natural safety, circumstance forced Pope to play
corner for much of his career. So he is a versatile athlete. In
this training camp, he has been working exclusively at strong
safety.
</P>
<P>
   When the exhibition season began last weekend in St. Louis, Pope
was playing behind Je'Rod Cherry. But during drills on Tuesday,
Pope played with the first team.
</P>
<P>
   If the competition between Pope and Cherry ultimately is decided
on poise, it's no contest. Pope wears a cap with the word relax on
it. It is his way of reminding people to calm down. Don't worry,
he's got it all under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic,'' he said. ``Therefore, I create a
winning and successful mind-set. Have I not been a starter? You
have to work at wanting something. If you want something you have
to work to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relax, but my pulse is still beating very rapidly. I'm a
very eager person. But that's inside. It's hidden. All this energy
in me comes out on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   And that energy, he believes, will help the Raiders become a
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time for everybody,'' he said. ``I think it is time
for the Raiders. Me being here, I'm saying I want to be a part of
this building to something. Gruden has been here three years. He
has this image in his mind. And everybody has to see this same
picture. That's the ultimate goal in sports, being a champion.''

   Q: I am trying to locate ``food pails,'' takeout containers with
little metal handles. Can you tell me where I can buy these items?
</P>
<P>
   _ Peter Yu, Norcross, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Takeout containers have never looked so chic. We discovered
these handy-dandy items at Cost Plus World Market, 4733-A Ashford
Dunwoody Road (678-731-0014). Each paper pail, which comes in such
colors as red, purple, green and brown, holds 1 pint and is 79
cents. And the Container Store sells plastic Chinese cartons
($1.49-$1.99) that can be used for food, gifts or party favors.

I have ever used. The problem? I can no longer find it. Do you know
where I can find this product?

also ``removes stains, reduces plaque, fights bacteria and promotes
healthy gum tissue.''

which are thick terry-cloth cotton towels. Order them through the
Hammacher Schlemmer catalog at 1-800-543-3366. The Web site is
www.hammacher.com. A bath towel, 27 inches by 55 inches, is $29.95.

 &HT;    MEDICAL MISTAKES BLAMED FOR NURSING HOME INJURIES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medical error accounts for most of the frequent
medication-related injuries in nursing homes, a new study has
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Of 546 cases examined, more than half could have been prevented,
says the report to be published next week in the American Journal
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The study ``offers an incredible opportunity to impact
meaningfully on the health of a very vulnerable patient
population,'' said Jerry H. Gurwitz, the University of
Massachusetts Medical School professor who led the research team.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the study, which focused on 18 nursing homes in
Massachusetts, found that the more serious incidents tended to be
the most preventable.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the mistakes could be traced either to
prescription errors or negligent nursing care, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In about half of the 276 ``preventable'' cases, physicians
ordered incorrect doses, prescribed drugs with harmful interactions
or chose the wrong medication. In the other cases, injury from
medication was traced to improper monitoring, such as a failure by
the nursing staff to notice or respond to symptoms of drug
toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   Medications most often involved in medical errors were
psychoactive drugs (including antidepressants and sedatives) and
anticoagulants, which are taken to reduce blood clotting.
</P>
<P>
   The research team also found 188 instances of drug reactions
that almost resulted in injuries. About 80 percent of these ``near
misses'' were traced to the blood thinner warfarin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study points out that it's not just a small list of
so-called 'bad drugs' in the elderly that we need to be concerned
about, it's the whole range of drugs,'' Gurwitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Applied nationwide, the findings indicate that an average-sized
nursing home (106 beds) would have at least 24 adverse drug
incidents a year. That would mean that among the 1.5 million U.S.
nursing home residents, there are at least 350,000
medication-related injuries annually and that the majority of those
cases could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier Institute of Medicine study estimated that medication
errors in U.S. hospitals cause 40,000 to 100,000 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home research, sponsored by the National Institute
on Aging, called for more systematic, computer-assisted ways to
monitor prescription drugs for nursing home residents, who average
six medications each.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report did not call for penalizing nursing homes or
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``One approach is to seek out and punish health care providers
who make errors that lead to adverse drug events,'' the report
concludes, ``but that approach ignores the fact that failures in
the design of systems of care often contribute to the occurrence of
medical errors, as well as the injuries that result from some of
those errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the report called for ``enhanced surveillance and
reporting'' of drug-related injuries and continued education on the
proper use of drug therapies in the frail elderly population.

   INDIANAPOLIS _ The dress code came. The dress code went. Then
the guest list grew and grew until the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials
turned into one of those weddings where the second cousin of the
groom's barber ends up with an engraved invitation.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of these trials, which begin their eight-day run
Wednesday, is excess. More swimmers, more races, more fabric.
</P>
<P>
   It may be appropriate since the Olympic team picked here will go
on to Australia, where the significance of swimming is blown out of
proportion in a manner akin to the ``Tiger Woods, World Savior''
frenzy gripping the sports media in this part of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But the Olympic trials should be designed for elitism, sorting
out the best swimmers, not excess. U.S. Swimming lowered the
qualifying standards for this year's meet, hoping to let younger
swimmers gain experience. A total of 1,306 people made the times.
Four years ago, only 570 did.
</P>
<P>
   Picture a jammed pool for warmups and preliminary heats that
stack up all afternoon. As Tom Malchow, the world-record holder in
the 200-meter butterfly, says: ``It isn't pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he wasn't talking about difficulty getting into a
crowded pool. He was talking about the complications of getting
into his bathing suit. It is an innovative full-body outfit,
completely different from the microscopic slashes of Lycra that men
have worn in competitive swimming for ages. Malchow finds himself
morphing into an Olympic gymnast, hopping and twisting every which
way, just to pull the suit on. The process takes at least five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the trials, wriggling into the suit took much longer. U.S.
Swimming initially banned the new product, known as the ``shark
suit'' because the fabric allegedly mimics the sleek skin of a
shark. The suit would be permitted in the Olympics, but the
governing body feared that some competitors wouldn't be able to get
one in time for the meet.
</P>
<P>
   A little saber-ratting from the lawyers for a manufacturer
changed that policy. Malchow will wear the suit, which he believes
helps him ride higher in the water. Some other swimmers find it
constricting, and they'll stick to the traditional, skimpy garb.
The only remaining excess in this controversy will surface when the
shark suit hits the open market after the Olympics _ at a price of
$250.
</P>
<P>
   Even the timing of this meet goes to extremes. It is very, very
unfashionably late.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strong thunderstorms will erupt Thursday across parts of the
Tennessee Valley and Middle Atlantic states in the vicinity of a
front on the leading edge of less humid air. In the wake of the
front, humidity levels will recede from Wednesday's sultry levels
across the eastern Great Lakes and much of the Northeast. Humidity
levels will only slowly ebb over parts of the northern Middle
Atlantic Seaboard, where the southern end of the front slows.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Depression Four will raise the chance of showers and
thunderstorms along Florida's east coast from about Daytona south.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated to widely separated thunderstorms will develop later
Thursday over the mountains of southern Montana and northern
Wyoming as a cool front approaches. Storms will then move toward
the high plains of the western Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TROPICAL INFLATION &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center christened Tropical Depression
Four Wednesday morning, a small, modestly swirling group of showers
and thunderstorms 120 miles northeast of Freeport, the Bahamas.
Before satellites, such a diminutive system might have gone
unnoticed unless a ship navigated into it. Even Tropical Storm
Alberto, which early this week was a hurricane over the remote
Atlantic, might have escaped detection before the 1960s. By virtue
of technology, the modern count of tropical systems tends to be
inflated compared with tallies before satellites.

EMBATTLED INDONESIAN PRESIDENT GIVES UP ROLE IN DAY-TO-DAY
ADMINISTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Battered by a hostile parliament for his
haphazard managment style, President Abdurrahman Wahid said
Wednesday that he would hand over daily government administration
to Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement came after a day of raucous attacks on Tuesday
in a legislature where he can count on the support of only a small
minority and where some members have called for his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regarding the criticisms of my style of management, I can
understand them and I will assign the vice president to handle the
daily tasks of management, to draw up the cabinet's working agenda
and to establish the focus and priorities of government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, read by an aide because the president is
virtually blind, he emphasized that Megawati would report to him
and that the arrangement was within the constitutional framework of
the presidential system.
</P>
<P>
   It was a retreat for Wahid after 10 tumultuous months in office,
but perhaps a tactical one as he fends off threats from almost all
sides, including the much of the tenuous coalition that voted him
into office.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, in the long run, whether it would calm the
political scene, where uncertainty and disarray have caused the
currency to slide in value and investors to withhold their business
from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid had said on Monday that he would appoint a deputy to
handle the daily affairs of government while he concentrated more
on external affairs. Prominent parliamentary figures immediately
insisted that Megawati be named.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how this devolution of his duties would be
implemented and aides said the details of the arrangement remained
to be worked out. Megawati herself, though politically popular, is
not a hands-on manager and the possibility remained that a separate
``first minister'' would be named to report to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it amounts to facing a new reality and new
expectations and making the best of a complex and difficult
situation,'' said Aristides Katoppo, an editor and political
commentator. ``There may still be compromises within the
compromise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Greg Barton, an Australian academic who is writing Wahid's
biography and has daily access to him, said: ``We'll have to wait
and see in the next days. I think we've just seen a fairly slick
bit of footwork. He's seized the initiative and turned it around on
his own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Megawati won a large plurality in June 1999 in
Indonesia's first democratic election, Wahid triumphed in the
parliamentary session in October that formally chose the president.
</P>
<P>
   He had won only a small portion of the popular vote but was the
compromise choice of legislators who opposed Megawati. Now much of
that coalition has turned against him as Indonesian politics
descends into a free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   Some political commentators said Wednesday that Wahid's
opponents, having failed to manipulate him in office, might be
hoping that Megawati may be a softer target.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement, if it does move forward, throws Indonesia's
leadership into new flux, analysts said. The relationship between
the president and vice president has been difficult and their
political constituencies remain at odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably a necessary but insufficient condition for
trying to reach a deal,'' a Western diplomat said of the
announcement. ``What has got to be done is to see whether the offer
is accepted and how it works in practice. The devil is in the
details and the modalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid had already handed certain responsibilities to his vice
president _ including management of separatist and sectarian
violence in Irian Jaya and the Maluku islands _ but she had been
largely passive as those crises worsened, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wahid described their relations on Monday as like a
brother and sister, their dealings in recent weeks have been
severely strained. Megawati failed to attend his birthday party
last week and declined his request to read recent speeches on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the issue is whether they can establish a modus vivendi to
really work these things out,'' the diplomat said. ``If she is to
be a kind of de facto prime minister, the question will be whether
she is prepared to exercise power and whether the president and
vice president are prepared to work together in a constructive
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's founding father, Sukarno,
enjoys broad and enthusiastic public support. She has shown little
appetite for political battle or active leadership, but she has put
together a solid team of aides.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has earned widespread respect for his integrity and
democratic ideals but demonstrated little aptitude for
administration. In addition, he has found himself in charge of weak
and incompetent government institutions that were neutered and
corrupted during the 32-year rule of President Suharto, who was
forced from office in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Often, when Wahid pulls the levers of power, little happens.
</P>
<P>
   But he has shown himself a master of one-upmanship, disarming
his challengers with unexpected moves that Barton, his biographer,
recently compared to the deceptively agile cut and thrust of the
blind swordsman of martial arts films.
</P>
<P>
   After his address Wednesday evening, Barton said, the president
seemed to be in high spirits. ``He turned to me and he said,
chuckling, `So the drunken master wins again.' ''

&HT;     OLD RULES WILL BE TESTED IN GORE-BUSH SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Aug. 13)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Old American traditions will be tested severely in
the November showdown between Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   One is that in time of soaring prosperity, voters do not defeat
the presidential candidate of the party in power. If that tradition
prevails in November, Gore will win.
</P>
<P>
   But there also is another, more recent custom that could help
Bush and the Republicans. That one favors a return to the White
House of the party that has been out of power for a while.
</P>
<P>
   In two recent elections, the Democratic Party fielded weak
candidates, and the Republicans were able to convert the
opposition's seeming impotence into victory.
</P>
<P>
   The first example occurred in 1980 when Jimmy Carter, seeking a
second term, presided over an economy in which inflation and
joblessness were at double digit levels and America was seemingly
powerless in the face of the capture and year-long imprisonment of
American hostages in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   That situation was exactly right for an engaging personality
like Ronald Reagan to convince voters that things would be better
under his conservative leadership and that America once more would
be that ``shining city on the hill.'' He easily defeated Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan occupied the White House for eight years and, at the end
of that time, public opinion polls indicated that a Democrat
probably would succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the way it worked out. In 1988 Vice President
George Bush won the GOP nomination and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats had nominated Michael Dukakis, who had been a
successful governor of Massachusetts but who seemed not to know why
he wanted to be president or how to cope with the mud that Bush
threw at him.
</P>
<P>
   In some earlier elections, the tradition that voters seek change
every eight years prevailed. Although Dwight D. Eisenhower was an
immensely popular president, Democrat John F. Kennedy was able in
1960 to squeak by his vice president, Richard Nixon, in the battle
for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after that, Nixon took advantage of the difficulties
confronted by Lyndon Johnson, Kennedy's successor, and finally won
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But when Nixon was forced to resign in 1973 because of the
Watergate scandal and was succeeded by Gerald Ford, the Republicans
knew they were in trouble. Ford was a good man, but in the election
of 1976 Carter defeated him.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's victory overrode yet another tradition: The taller
candidate for president tends to win. Ford stood much taller than
Carter, but few voters realized it.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1980, Reagan made certain that voters would see his
height advantage over Carter in their nationally televised debate.
In violation of rules that had been agreed on, Reagan walked across
the stage and shook hands with Carter. That action appeared to be a
genial gesture, but with his knowledge of theatrics, Reagan must
have understood the advantage he would gain when voters saw him
towering over Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The major tradition to be tested this year centers around the
religion of the Democratic vice presidential nominee and whether
anti-Semitism will be a factor in the vote. The American people are
being asked to decide whether they want to place a Jewish senator
from Connecticut, Joseph Lieberman, just one heartbeat away from
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is not the only issue in this year's election.
But it became an unexpected challenge to Gore when he selected
Lieberman as his vice presidential running mate last week.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's ideology is close to Gore's. Both are centrist
Democrats. But American voters never before have been asked to vote
for a Jew for such a high office.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1928, when Catholic Alfred E. Smith was rejected for
president, and 1960, when Kennedy, another Catholic, was elected,
American voters will face another test of religious tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, however, that had Smith, the governor of New
York, been a Protestant, voters still probably would have rejected
him because his image _ with a brown derby hat, ever-present cigar
and streets-of-New York accent _ was not what a majority of
Americans expected in their president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, prosperity was rampant. So in 1928 they chose
Herbert Hoover, with his starchy collars and starchy personality.
And they found themselves immersed in the worst depression in
American history. After four years, they ousted him and elected
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy _ young, charming and urbane _ was much more acceptable
to the electorate than Smith had been. But even he barely defeated
Nixon in the 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential contenders often declare that they just want to
discuss the issues. But the truth is that elections are often
determined in part by such other matters as personality, personal
appearance, religion, the desire for change, the health of the
economy, the status of our national defense _ and even the
contrasting height of the two presidential nominees.

DALLAS EXHIBIT RANGES FROM FINE CHINA TO TV TRAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memory comes alive at the Dallas Museum of Art's current
exhibition, ``Tabletop to TV Tray: China and Glass in America,
1880-1980.'' In this retrospective setting, the banal plate, bowl
and jug suddenly take on artistic totem status, displaying a
swanlike grace and sparkling color palette.
</P>
<P>
   Through more than 500 objects, ``Tabletop to TV Tray'' spans 100
years of how America surrounded itself with objects from which to
nibble or gorge, imbibe or quaff with abandon. The viewer tours a
range of domestic tableware, including fine crystal, delicately
etched china and highly practical refrigerator containers.
</P>
<P>
   All the recognizable names have been assembled from yesteryear's
pantries. Baccarat and Wedgwood, Lenox and Spode, Waterford and
Steuben are just a few of the labels whose furnishings have been
part of so many generations' sideboards.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition is also a rearview mirror on a century's worth
of social history. It is a highly democratic undertaking,
displaying elite White House china and glassware side-by-side with
that 1960s staple, the foldable TV tray. The bridal registry (for
the record, the practice started in Marshall Field's grand
department store in the 1930s) is celebrated for its seismic social
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Although organized in only a lazy chronology (one of the few
miscues), the exhibition traipses back to the latter years of the
1800s, when dining was a heavily starched affair full of Victorian
ceremony and unassailable refinement. Majolica dinnerware featured
almost comically extravagant use of flowers, fruit and game motifs
on everything from beer steins to bulbous casseroles. Wealth was
celebrated in the manufacture of dozens of specialized dishes: an
indented one for oysters, an apothecarylike jar for pickles. Lacy
Limoges porcelain was a period staple, but perhaps nothing marked
the apogee of status better than the ``Grand Prize'' pattern punch
bowl of 1905. The bowl on exhibit is molded with so many facets
that it glitters with the fire of a diamond.
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th century dawned, it heralded the emergence of the
middle class and a lifestyle demanding more practicality and less
precious beauty from its tableware. The 1920s saw the heavier use
of the striated ``Pyramid'' and ``Tea Room'' patterns for glasses
and jugs, in addition to designs featuring colored enamels and
gilding. America would come to consider the unbreakable quality of
Pyrex glass a miracle hybrid of cooking and tableware.
Advertisements from Corning Glass Works from the period called
dining ``an art'' when Pyrex was involved. Meantime, Tiffin Glass
introduced a heavily etched jug, made to hold the novelty of the
day, iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   The 1930s produced a panoply of novelty containers for every
kind of food, from spaghetti sets to egg and corn holders. This
decade was also a launching pad for the eye-catching shapes and
mustard and salmon tints of ``American Modern'' tableware, in
addition to the molded fanning of dishes seen in ``Petalware.''
Acid-etching on glass in the early '30s resulted in whole art-deco
scenes played out on the sides of dining goblets.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Wedgwood managed to induce the most
conservative of Americans to add English bone china (the
``Josephine'' and ``Wildflower'' lines) to their table settings.
Postwar America was a land inebriated by victory, with a giddiness
seen in china sets rife with speckles, stripes and geometric grids.
Late 1940s shapes are softly rounded with burnished edges, with the
``Jubilee'' set all shades of pale cream and mint.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, martini shakers and backyard barbecues accent the
flashy way to entertain. Charles Murphy's delicately swirling
casserole dishes appear on tables while stemware, mostly cut in a
clean-lined, Swedish style, emerges in every hue from transparent
to rose-petal red. Dansk Designs almost singlehandedly popularizes
stoneware worldwide with its hard, matte finish and understated
form. And Northern Industrial Chemical Company comes up with
plastic designs that mold pursed-lipped edges onto various oval
containers.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the new and socially domineering medium of television
barges into the dining hour, requiring even more casual forms of
china and the birth of the stackable TV tray table _ the perfect
companion for 1954's newly introduced Swanson TV dinner. The
invention of the automatic dishwasher all but eliminates the
once-robust sales of fine china, and also forces dinnerware to
become more resistant to crude detergents.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, radiant color schemes and trippy patterns spill
all over table settings. The ``Man in Space'' series illustrates
the surreal themes often played out on the plate. Still, hard-core
endurance was a selling point as Corning advertised its ``Centura''
tableware as being as delicate as porcelain but able to pass the
``3,000 meal test.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit all but genuflects before the White House's
unwavering standard of dining refinement. There is an oyster plate,
chosen by Mrs. Rutherford B. Hayes, who also added the special
touch of American animal and flower ornamentation to the forever
classic Limoges design. Some of the infamous Reagan White House
1981 china, in its nouveau regal-blue-and-white pattern, is on
display. There's also an iced-tea glass that was selected for the
White House by Jackie Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of the various global art movements, such as
cubism, and day-to-day glass and china appears in the ``Ruba
Rombic'' plate, salad plate, sherbet glass and tumbler. First
bowing during a 1928 glass and china exposition in Pittsburgh, this
set celebrates all the clean-lined cubist angularity. The
between-the-wars Bauhaus movement is shown to best effect in a 1930
tea set, with its bravura display of conical shapes with
disk-shaped attachments. Later, the ``Freeform'' butter dish and
``California Aztec'' patterned plate reflect the disparate
influences of sculptors such as Alexander Calder and Henry Moore.
</P>
<P>
   And no tabletop exhibit would be complete without a bow to the
mass migration of the American middle class toward the wilds of
outdoor dining. ``Tamac'' tableware of the 1940s accessorized much
of this movement with its wavy-gravy shapes and distinctive rainbow
of tints from avocado green to ``frosty fudge'' brown.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what perhaps brands this exhibition as triumphant is
the wave of nostalgia that it sends washing over any patron. The
mere sight of a Danish modern bit of stemware, or the rough
geometric shapes emblazoned on numerous plates, should be enough to
send anyone scurrying down to the cellar, rummaging for that
discarded accessory of a past repast.

   New Palms Emphasize Price, Power and Color  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as the stores are stuffed with all the new fashions for
fall, the fresh hot gadgets are beginning to roll out into the
marketplace as well. Earlier this week, Palm Inc. announced its new
product lineup, which includes a low-priced entry-level version of
the Palm organizer, a RAM infusion for the company's wireless model
and two new limited editions of the Palm Vx.
</P>
<P>
   Palm's new low-end organizer, the m100, has new applications and
a simple cable for synchronizing the device to a desktop computer _
all for about $149, which would be the lowest price for a Palm to
date. The new Palm has all the standard applications for things
like addresses and a calendar plus an electronic notepad that lets
people use their own handwriting to jot down phone numbers and
reminders. A new clock application, which displays the time through
a small window in the m100s fliptop case, can be activated with the
press of a button on the front of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   The m100, with two megabytes of RAM, is aimed more at home users
than at business executives or professionals with more demanding
needs for personal digital assistants. Following the lead of Nokia,
which makes available colorful covers for cell phones, Palm is
offering snap-on faceplates in different colors for the m100. Each
plate costs around $20.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Palm VII device, which has attracted a great
number of handheld users seeking instant and integrated wireless
access, is getting just what its critics said it needed: more
memory. The new Palm VIIx, priced at $449, will now be packing
eight megabytes of RAM (up from two megabytes) and twice as many
Web clipping applications as were offered by the original wireless
effort. Users will get 40 of the streamlined-for-the-handheld Web
programs, like CBS MarketWatch.com and Travelocity.com, right out
of the box, and more than 400 applications are available for
downloading from the www.palm.net site.
</P>
<P>
   And it wouldn't be fall without some color, so fans of the
company's popular Palm Vx unit can now choose between a
``millennium blue'' and a goldish ``champagne'' aluminum casing.
The limited-edition devices are available for $399 each at the
company's site.

   Translation Tool Knocks Down Language Barriers for Pen Pals
</P>
<P>
   For years, teachers have been matching their students with pen
pals in foreign countries to encourage them to learn about other
cultures. But language barriers have always been a huge hurdle for
both teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   Now ePals.com, an education Web site, is using translation
technology to eliminate that problem. Students using the site, at
www.epals.com, compose e-mail messages in their native languages
and then click on a button for automatic translations. So far, the
system lets students switch from English to one of a number of
languages: French, German, Japanese, Italian, Spanish and
Portuguese, or from those languages to English. Several other
combinations, like Spanish to Italian, are also possible. ``This is
the Internet's first e-mail service with language translation
available right within the Web browser,'' said Tim DiScipio,
ePals.com's chief executive and co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   The site provides other tools, too, like a database of high
schools that are interested in pairing (more than 65,000 classrooms
in 182 countries are participating) and filtering software. By the
fall, the service will also include materials from Scholastic.com,
a large educational service that has formed a partnership with
ePals.com to trade content and translation services.

prices will find just the thing on the market later this month.
Samsung Electronics is rolling out the ML-4500, a small, versatile
laser printer for the unusually low street price of $199.
</P>
<P>
   The Samsung ML-4500, which prints in black and white, works with
systems running Windows 95 or later. It will also work with Linux
and uses a parallel port to connect to the computer. The ML-4500
can print up to 8 pages per minute and has a resolution of 600 dots
per inch. The printer also features something called ``N-up
printing mode,'' which the company says can be used to print up to
16 minipages of text on one piece of paper, thus creating an index
sheet to help find your way through long documents.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their slower, less-expensive inkjet brethren, which shoot
small drops of ink onto the paper to create text and images, laser
printers use a printing process similar to that of a photocopier.
Even though laser-printer prices have fallen quite a bit, this
printing method, which is generally faster and produces
higher-quality prints, usually costs more than inkjet printers.
</P>
<P>
   The $199 price, which is about $100 cheaper than for many other
printers in its category, may appeal to buyers for price alone.
Samsung is also touting the ML-4500 for its ``paper-jam-free
technology.'' For anyone who has had to extract bits of the
company's annual report from a printer's innards while on deadline,
the ML-4500 could pay for itself rather quickly.

   Now You Can Your Show From Just About Anywhere
</P>
<P>
   In what the company calls ``the ultimate remote control,''
owners of ReplayTV-based digital video recorders may soon be able
to operate their recorders at home from anywhere in the world
through the Internet. For example, a New Yorker traveling in Texas
would be able to log on to the www.myreplaytv.com Web site, view
hometown program listings, set the recorder to capture a show, view
the amount of recording time left on the disk and make sure that
the show is being recorded. Of course, that's assuming that the
system works as described yesterday. ReplayTV concedes that it has
not been tested outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The new service, called MyReplayTV, will be available this fall,
when ReplayTV upgrades the system software for its recorders, said
Jim Hollingsworth, a senior vice president for the company, which
is in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the more common videocassette recorders, digital video
recorders capture programs as digital files on a giant hard disk;
users can easily skip through commercials and other tedious parts
of a program. A ReplayTV recorder with 30 hours of capacity costs
about $600, and one with 20 hours costs $400 to $500. &QL;

GLASSES THAT LIGHT UP THE DAY MAY ALSO LIGHTEN GLOOMY SPIRITS
</HEADLINE>
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For people who become depressed when the days grow short, a
condition called seasonal affective disorder, one treatment is to
sit in front of bright light for an hour or more each day. But a
common complaint of patients is that they do not have time to do
that regularly.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to have patients wear light visors, with either
incandescent or white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) under the brims.
That lets the patients move around while they get extra light, but
some doctors question the effectiveness of the visors, saying the
light exposure is inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Enlightened Technologies Associates, based in
Fairfax, Va. (www.etai.com), says it has developed special glasses,
called Somnavue, that can deliver light therapy more effectively to
people who need it. Light therapy is also used to help people with
sleep disorders and jet lag, in additional to those with seasonal
affective disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The glasses are attached by a fiber-optic bundle to a
Walkman-size box, worn on the belt or in a pocket, containing
battery-powered LEDs. They produce light that goes through the
fibers to the eyeglasses' frames, at the back of the ears. The
light moves through the frame to six optical fibers that ring the
middle of each lens. Each fiber is linked to its own red, green or
blue LED, and they aim light at the pupil at angles that get light
to the periphery of the retina without interfering with vision, or
being obvious to other people.
</P>
<P>
   Light therapy is thought to be effective for conditions like
seasonal affective disorder or jet lag because light is the most
powerful environmental cue for setting the daily biological
rhythms, called circadian rhythms, that affect things like hormone,
sleep and mood cycles. Light exposure signals an area of the brain
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a cluster of cells near the
spot where the optic nerves cross. The brain sends information
about light to the pineal gland, which is at the base of the brain
and produces a hormone called melatonin, which helps regulate
circadian rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of light a person is exposed to determines how much
melatonin is released from the pineal gland and carried through the
bloodstream. The pineal's melatonin production peaks during the
night; light drives melatonin levels down.
</P>
<P>
   A clock and a microprocessor in the Somnavue control box can be
programmed to turn the lens light on and off at specified times of
day, and the light intensity can be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Enlightened Technologies received a research grant to develop
the glasses from the National Institutes of Health. It has
conducted several studies in the last couple of years with Columbia
University and Northwestern University on Somnavue's effect in
seasonal affective disorder and sleep disorders.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1998-99, early prototypes of the glasses were
used in a study conducted on patients with seasonal affective
disorder at the Sleep Disorders Institute at St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital Center in New York. Dr. Gary K. Zammit, director of the
institute, said the glasses had been tested on 17 people; nine were
exposed to high-intensity light and eight were exposed to lower
intensities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck us was that even the low-intensity groups got
better,'' Zammit said. ``It may have been a placebo, or that even
low-intensity light had some biological effect. But by the third
week, there was a statistical improvement in both groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The glasses send light toward the eyes even as the person
wearing them moves, something that bright light boxes or light
visors can not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light boxes didn't provide the uniformity of exposure
because people using them could just look away, and the light
visors were only bringing light in from one direction and hitting
the eye at an angle that didn't allow for maximum exposure,''
Zammit said.
</P>
<P>
   Next winter, Zammit said, the Sleep Disorders Institute will
study the effect of the glasses on patients' melatonin levels and
sleep and depression patterns.
</P>
<P>
   At Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, the
glasses were tested on older patients with sleep problems that made
them wake up too early in the morning, before they had slept
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Each patient wore the glasses for about two hours between 8 p.m.
and 10 p.m. at very high light levels, between 1,400 and 2,000 lux
(brighter than most offices), for several weeks. The study
concluded that the glasses did as good a job at helping people's
sleep patterns as did putting patients in front of light boxes for
their light therapy.
</P>
<P>
   With the glasses on, people could read or walk around, which
they could not do when using a light box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that light works, but it's so impractical that even
patients who find it effective can't afford to sit for an hour in
front of a light box,'' said Dr. Phyllis C. Zee, a neurology
professor who is director of the sleep disorders program at
Northwestern University Medical School. ``The advantage of these
glasses is that they're more practical, and they're something more
patients will be able to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though some of the prototype models did not fit some of the
patients' faces exactly, Zee said, the colored lights emitted by
the lens fibers had a more soothing effect than the direct bright
light of a light box.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were much easier and soothing on the eyes,'' she said,
``because they had this wonderful color spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said the glasses were also designed to treat jet lag. A
person traveling from New York to England, for example, could
arrive in England in the morning, avoid bright light for a few
hours, then use the glasses for about three hours in the afternoon
(morning in New York) to reset the biological clock to England's
time, Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Charmane Eastman, director of the Biological Rhythms
Research Laboratory at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center
in Chicago, said that a single light treatment would be unlikely to
shift someone's biological clock more than two or three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Enlightened Technologies is seeking the Food and Drug
Administration's approval for Somnavue and talking to manufacturers
about producing test models. Goldman said the company had recently
received another grant from the National Institutes of Health to
look at how the glasses might be used to track the slow eye
movements that indicate fatigue. That would let researchers find
out how tired people became while working late shifts in factories,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fiber can transmit light in both directions, so we could
take the reflection from the eye and analyze that back in the
control box,'' he said.

STUDY FINDS DIFFICULTIES WITH READING ON SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some skeptics may believe something only when they see it in
writing, but is the writing more believable when it is seen on
paper rather than on a computer screen?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it is, based on a recent study at Ohio State
University. The purpose of the study, which involved 131 Ohio State
undergraduates, was to look at differences in comprehension of
something read on a printed page and the same thing on a computer
screen, said Dr. Karen Murphy, assistant professor of educational
psychology at Ohio State and co-author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The students were divided into three groups and asked to read
and answer a series of questions on two magazine essays, one on
school integration, the other on doctor-assisted suicide for
terminally ill patients. One group read the articles on paper and
answered questions on paper, another read the articles on a desktop
computer and answered questions on paper, and the remaining group
read the articles and answered the questions on a desktop computer.
The articles had the same formats in print as they did on the
computer screen, but the students who read the paper versions found
the articles more interesting and persuasive than did the students
who read the articles on computers.
</P>
<P>
   The group that read the essay on doctor-assisted suicide, for
example, gave the essay an average understandability rating of 7.76
(on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest). The group that read
the same article and answered questions on the computer gave it an
average understandability rating of 6.85, while the group that read
the article on the computer and answered questions on paper gave it
an average understandability rating of 6.55.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the study brings to light the effectiveness of using
computers and the Internet in middle and high schools if students
aren't as able to understand material they read on a computer.
What's more, she said, younger students with lower reading
abilities might have more trouble comprehending material online
than the college students tested in the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's true we can use online mediums to give students
access to information they would never have had before, it raises
the questions about how much they can comprehend from the texts,''
she said. ``Computers are put into schools to enhance learning, but
if it's difficult for some students to comprehend online material,
then the computer access isn't necessarily enhancing learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Although students can print articles they find online, some
schools have limited printing resources. ``Many of the urban
schools we have been working with barely have decent computers and
monitors much less printers for the students to use,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Martin, a senior who participated in the study, said
that in general, he can comprehend both print and online articles
to the same degree, but that he has to focus more when he reads
articles online because he finds information presented on the Web
to be distracting. ``Most Web sites are designed to look fun,'' he
said. ``There are all these great graphics, and it takes
concentration to home in and focus on the actual information.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin often finds himself struggling to digest the information
on a Web page before being lured away by links to other pages. And
like others who use the Web as a research tool, he frequently
prints things out because he likes to read them while he's away
from a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Other students who do a lot of research on the Web end up
printing out what they find because it's hard for them to read
lengthy texts on the computer. ``Scrolling through 30 pages on the
screen is not so comfy on the eyes,'' said Allison Boyle, a law
student at the University of Maryland. ``It's a good scanning tool,
but when it comes to using what I find, I print it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Printing portions of case law and other articles also lets Boyle
make notes in margins and highlight paragraphs. ``You can't really
do that on a computer screen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Rawlins, a professor of computer science at Indiana
University at Bloomington, said students have to work a little
harder when they read articles on a computer screen because they
don't have the same visual cues that they would have with a book or
typed or written material. ``There might be a coffee stain or a
fold in a page, supposedly incidental things, but they help the
mind associate what's on the page with what is being read,'' he
said. ``You might have the same information on a computer screen,
but it's much harder to reconstruct the information that's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the Ohio State study suggested that students may
need to be better trained to absorb material from of a computer
screen. The fact that information found online often contains links
to other pages is an example of how reading a Web page differs from
the more linear nature of reading a paper page.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really sure, but it may be that the skills students
use when reading plain paper, such as linking what the text says to
their prior knowledge, don't necessarily transfer online,'' she
said. ``It may be a matter of teaching different types of
strategies for processing information online.''

DOING IT YOUR WAY: SORTING AND COPYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is there a way to put my Internet Explorer 5.0 Favorites in
the order I want them, instead of in the order I collected them?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a couple of ways for you to rearrange the Web sites
on your Favorites list to your liking.
</P>
<P>
   You can click on the names of the sites and drag them to where
you want them to go.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a large number of sites bookmarked and would like a
quicker method of arranging them, you can put them into
alphabetical order. To do that, click once on the Favorites menu in
your Explorer menu bar, then right-click on any of the sites on the
list. Select Sort by Name to rearrange the list alphabetically by
site name.
</P>
<P>
   If you use folders within your Favorites list, you will need to
open each folder and right-click to sort by name.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users running Internet Explorer 5.0 should click on
the Favorites tab on the left side of the browser window, then on
the Organize button.
</P>
<P>
   Select Open Favorites Window and click on the Name button at the
top of the column to sort them alphabetically.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are MP3 files illegal, or is it trading them that is against
the law?
</P>
<P>
   A. An MP3 audio file itself is not illegal. MP3 is a computer
file format that allows the conversion of music from a compact disc
or other audio source into a small, good-quality computer file.
</P>
<P>
   It is what is done with MP3 files after they are made that has
become controversial, as illustrated by the current legal fight
between Napster and the Recording Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is one of the Web services that allow people to search
for MP3 files online and download them _ or upload their own MP3
files.
</P>
<P>
   The use of MP3 files falls under U.S. copyright law, and the
recording industry group says that Napster contributes to copyright
infringement. (For anyone interested in the Copyright Law of the
United States itself, a complete version can be downloaded in text
or Portable Document Format at lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/title17.)
</P>
<P>
   Converting songs from a CD to the MP3 format so that you can
play them on your computer or a portable MP3 player is legal as
long as you paid for the original CD.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, it is just like making a tape from albums in
your music collection for your personal use. As long as you do not
publicly redistribute the music without authorization from the
copyright holder, making a copy for private use is currently fine.
</P>
<P>
   Many songs that surface on the Internet were probably copied
from their original sources and distributed illegally, but there
are many sites where you can legally download and listen to MP3
files.
</P>
<P>
   The recording artists _ most of them not signed with a record
label _ who created the songs on those sites, like the ones found
on MP3.com (www.mp3.com), have given the site permission to
distribute their songs.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I keep getting a ``disk is locked'' message when trying to
copy a file to a floppy. Is it my old Mac or the disk that's bad?
</P>
<P>
   A. The problem is most probably with the floppy disk, but it's
not as bad as it might seem. On the back of the disk, you should
see a small plastic tab in a corner. If that tab is in the ``up''
position, exposing a small hole in the disk, then the disk has been
locked to prevent anyone from overwriting the files on it.
</P>
<P>
   To unlock it, slide the tab to the lower position and reinsert
the floppy into your drive. Windows users who are getting ``cannot
write'' messages while trying to save a file to a floppy should
check the tab on the disk as well.
</P>
<P>
   The lock is similar to the cassette-tape tabs that you can punch
out to keep the tape from being copied over. The machine senses
whether the tab is there and stops you from overwriting a
write-protected disk.

MY JOB: YOGURT THIS IS NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Jack England is a yoga instructor, Club Med Sandpiper, Port St.
Lucie, Fla.; this was written with TANYA MOHN)  
 By JACK ENGLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I teach every day, seven days a week. I'm on stage three or four
nights a week in different shows. I do things that 16-year-old
girls can't do. I didn't start yoga until I was about 50, and I'm
79 now.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are frightened by the word yoga. They think I'm
going to twist their mind or something. We don't do the meditation
here; we do the physical aspects of yoga. Stretching is something
that you can do all your life _ in your 70s, 80s and 90s. There's
no bouncing, no jumping. When you stretch, your veins and arteries
become more elastic, improving your circulation.
</P>
<P>
   I remember I was warming up once in one of the conference rooms
here and I saw some people go by. I brought one leg straight up
over my head and touched the wall behind me, parallel to my ear,
and I heard the child say to her mother: ``Look. That man has only
one leg.''
</P>
<P>
   And that exercise is really so simple. Some of the stuff I do is
even more surprising to people. I've got a board that I made so I
can get up on a headstand in a water ski show that I'm in on Monday
afternoons. As we go past the audience, I'm in a shoulder stand.
Then I come into splits, then lotus up and down. I'm down in a wake
so you don't see my head. The announcer is saying, ``He is now
holding his breath for 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 minutes.'' Of course, I'm
breathing all the time, but you can't see that 'cause you can't see
my head.
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, I was shot down and I fractured my back,
so I lost a year out of my life in the hospital. As a result of
physical therapy, I became more conscious of my body, so somebody
took me to a yoga class one day.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know yoga from yogurt. But I worked on these various
different aspects of flexibility, and it just got easier and
easier. It changed my life.
</P>
<P>
   I retired after 44 years as an electronic engineer with the
Department of Defense and started traveling around the world going
to different health spas and yoga ashrams, getting ideas for
something that I would like to own, and I dropped in at Club Med
Ixtapa, in Mexico. I put on a yoga demonstration, and they asked me
to stay. That was 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most disease is stress-related. It's usually the damn job or the
boss. Learn how to calm yourself down, breathe abdominally like a
baby in a crib. When you suck in that stomach all the time, that's
creating tension and stress.
</P>
<P>
   When men have their first heart attacks and survive, they go off
to a health spa, and for the first times ever they eat the right
food. All of a sudden they get their bodies back to their skinny
high-school weight, and they get one more chance to get it right.
</P>
<P>
   I once said to a woman, ``Keep your husband thin and you will
keep him longer.'' She whispered in my ear, ``I don't want to keep
him any longer.'' The world is filled with widows. Just load your
husband up with eggs and red meat, keep him smoking and you can
finish him off before he reaches 50!

 &HT;    BellSouth wireless data unit gets new CEO
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - BellSouth has named Don Kovalevich president and chief
executive of its wireless data unit.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalevich, who has been president and general manager of
Houston Cellular Telephone Co., said he has seen demand for
wireless phones explode in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless data is similarly positioned today,'' he said.
``People want data available anytime, anywhere, and the technology
is here to support that.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's wireless data unit, based in New Jersey, sells a
two-messaging service on pagers made by RIM Technologies. The
company's national wireless network is also used by the newest
generation of Palm personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Although data and Internet capabilities are increasingly
available on wireless phones, Kovalevich said he expects them to
serve a somewhat different audience than that of the pagers.
``These are different markets with different needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Phones have to combine a host of features in one device and thus
far are limited in the speed with which they transmit data. That
makes them more suited for the ``casual'' data user, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless data unit will be part of the new company being
created by combining the wireless businesses of BellSouth and SBC
Communications. While SBC's wireless phone business is larger than
BellSouth's, SBC has no similar data unit.
</P>
<P>
   William Lenahan resigned as president in May. With appointment
of Kovalevich, J.D. Gardner, who had served as acting president and
CEO since then, will return to his job as the unit's chief
financial officer.

 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman focused their first day campaigning
together on ``shared values,'' but also confronted the nuanced
differences between them on school vouchers and abortion. ``I'm not
afraid to have a vice president who disagrees with me on some
issues,'' Gore said at an elementary school in his home town of
Carthage, Tenn. ``The policy will be the policy I decide.'' Said
Lieberman: ``The differences are very, very few. We share values;
we share a vision for the future.'' After Tennessee, the newly
minted team was headed to Lieberman's home town of Stamford, Conn.

<P>
   FIRST SOLO STOP FOR CHENEY: HOMELESS SHELTER
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney visited a homeless shelter in St. Louis today on his
first solo campaign trip, touting George W. Bush's plan to help
faith-based groups that serve the poor. Cheney began a three-day
swing through Missouri, Ohio, Kentucky and Illinois at the the
Sunshine Mission, a privately funded Christian homeless shelter
with a rehab center for drug addicts and services for needy
families. As part of his ``compassionate conservative'' campaign,
Bush has called for partnerships between the government and
churches, charitable organizations and individuals who provide
services or donate money to fight the nation's social ills.
</P>
<P>
   SCORING ON ABORTION RIGHTS FRONT
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton is winning the battle against Senate rival Rick
Lazio when it comes to convincing New York voters who is the
stronger abortion rights supporter, a statewide poll reported
today. The Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found that 56
percent of voters said the first lady would be a strong supporter
of abortion rights in the Senate, while just 8 percent felt that
way about the Long Island congressman. Forty-five percent of New
York voters said abortion should be ``generally available to those
who want it'' while 13 percent said ``abortion should not be
permitted.'' Another 39 percent said abortion should be available,
but with stricter limits.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM SPLIT BRINGING ANOTHER CONVENTION?
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party forces opposed to ex-Republican Pat Buchanan as the
party's presidential candidate split from the group today and
started organizing their own convention to nominate someone else.
But Buchanan campaign officials said they had the delegates to win
the nomination and would press ahead with the planned convention,
which they said was the only legitimate Reform Party gathering. The
convention is slated to formally start Thursday in Long Beach,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN'S BATTLE TOO MUCH UPHILL
</P>
<P>
   As Pat Buchanan fights to secure the Reform Party nomination
this week, an even bigger battle lies ahead: winning over the
public. Only 17 percent of Americans say they'd seriously consider
voting for Buchanan, according to an ABCNEWS.com poll _ and that's
more a cap on his support than a base, since just considering a
candidate is a far cry from supporting him. Buchanan's actual
support for president is only 4 percent. In addition, just 17
percent want to see Buchanan nominated in the first place. And even
fewer, 10 percent, classify themselves as Reform Party supporters _
down from a high of 18 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL RIGHTS AND LIEBERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson said he thinks Al Gore's selection of the Jewish
Joseph Lieberman as his running mate will further break down
barriers of religion and race. ``Let the nation rejoice. The tent
is getting bigger and better,'' Jackson said at his Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition headquarters in Nashville. ``Another barrier falls and
another opportunity arises. A political risk, a moral certainty.''
Gore ``rejected a pattern of discrimination'' that has limited the
political opportunities of minorities, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   UNCIVIL RIGHTS AND LIEBERMAN
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP is considering suspending its Dallas branch president
for his harsh criticism of Joseph Lieberman. Speaking on a radio
talk show, Lee Alcorn, president of the Dallas NAACP, said, ``If we
get a Jew person, then what I'm wondering is, I mean, what is this
movement for, you know? Does it have anything to do with the failed
peace talks?'' Alcorn continued: ``So I think we need to be very
suspicious of any kind of partnerships between the Jews at that
kind of level because we know that their interest primarily has to
do with money and these kind of things.'' Kweisi Mfume, national
NAACP president. condemned the remarks as ``repulsive,
anti-Semitic, anti-NAACP and anti-American.'' He said he probably
would suspend Alcorn's membership and his position with the Dallas
branch.
</P>
<P>
   BARRAGE ON THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman's selection for the Democratic ticket prompted
a barrage of anti-Semitic comments in online chat rooms and
Internet message boards, leading some online services to start
purging offensive postings. Chat rooms on America Online and Yahoo
were peppered with slurs against Jews. At times, as many as half
the comments included offensive remarks. More than 20,000 comments
have been posted to an AOL message board devoted to conversation
about Lieberman, and many included disparaging references to Jews.
AOL began removing offensive postings, and said it was prepared to
suspend or cancel the accounts of those found to have violated the
service's rules against hate speech, vulgar language or harassment.
</P>
<P>
   HIS FAITH _ AND FAITH IN AMERICANS AND HIMSELF
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman says the American people will vote for him
based on what they think of him as a person and as a candidate, not
on his religion. An Orthodox Jew, Lieberman dismissed the idea that
anti-Semitism could damage Al Gore's chances of winning the White
House. ``I don't kid myself. I'm sure there are some anti-Semites
out there,'' he said on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' ``But you know .
. . the American people are so tolerant, they're so open; I'm just
convinced that they're going to vote for me or against me, based,
not on my religion, but based on how they judge me as a person and
whether they think I can do this job.''
</P>
<P>
   PRAYERFUL POLITICS: HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH?
</P>
<P>
   Normally in national politics it is the Republicans, influenced
for years by the religious right, who wear religion on their
sleeves. But Joseph Lieberman's introductory remarks to the nation
as Al Gore's running mate stood out as a very publicly invoked
display of religious faith and stirred some concern. ``If (the)
speech were the speech he gave every day, I would be troubled about
what he's trying to communicate,'' said Barry Lynn of Americans
United for Separation of Church and State. ``Americans are a
religious people, but they get very nervous, properly so, when
candidates appear to have more to say about their faith than they
do about their solutions to the country's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   LONG PROCESS OF INTEGRATION
</P>
<P>
   The arc of Joseph Lieberman's life neatly encapsulates the
remarkable change in circumstance of American Jews over the past
half-century: a rise to prominence, prosperity and acceptance in a
non-Jewish society. When Lieberman was born in 1942, American Jews
still couldn't buy property in many places in the United States. In
Connecticut, Jewish businessmen still couldn't borrow money locally
and had to drive into New York City to find friendly bankers. When
Lieberman arrived at Yale in the early 1960s, the university still
limited the number of Jewish students it accepted.

<P>
   GOP FIRES BACK IN ENVIRONMENTAL WARS
</P>
<P>
   A new Republican ad criticizes Al Gore for getting thousands of
dollars in royalty payments from a zinc mining operation on Gore
land in Tennessee, alleging the company has been found polluting a
nearby river. The TV spot, accusing Gore of hypocrisy, also claims
that Gore has been distorting George W. Bush's environmental record
in Texas. Republican officials are spending $3.7 million to run
their new spot in 17 states: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa,
Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri,
New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   MILLIONS TO GET OUT THE VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party leaders say they'll raise an unprecedented $100
million to mobilize voters for the Novembsaying that he had no way
of knowing how most senators would have acted, Daschle said, ``A
lot of people felt that by giving that speech, they didn't need to
go further than what he articulated on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYING POLITICS TO MAKE POLITICS WORK
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. John McCain opened his recent Senate drive to force
secretive political groups _ the so-called 527 groups, named after
their tax-code loophole _ to start disclosing their finances, it
sounded familiar to Joseph Lieberman. There was a good reason: It
started out as Lieberman's bill. But Lieberman's aides say he knew
it would attract more attention with McCain, whose presidential
primary campaign was based on that issue. So Lieberman co-sponsored
McCain's measure, McCain gave Lieberman credit for the idea and,
together, they steered the proposal _ the first successful campaign
reform initiative in two decades _ through all the legislative
traps and into law.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY INAUGURATION OK
</P>
<P>
   Inauguration Day next year falls on a Saturday, the Jewish
Sabbath. But if Joseph Lieberman is elected vice president, he
could still participate in the ceremony, his rabbi said. Lieberman,
an Orthodox Jew, observes the Sabbath by not working, driving or
writing from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. But he does vote
when the Senate meets in a rare Saturday session, by citing an
exception in Jewish law that allows work when human life or
national security is at stake. Rabbi Mark Dratch of Congregation
Agudath Sholom of Stamford, Conn., said Lieberman's faith would not
keep him from the festivities on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   PALESTINIANS LESS THAN OVERJOYED
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials have been choosing their words
diplomatically when commenting on the choice of the first Jewish
U.S. vice presidential candidate. But the buzz on the Palestinian
street, according to the Boston Glove, was that this would not
favor their side in the Middle East peace process. ``The real
feeling on the street is that here is another example of the
American unfairness and leaning towards Israel because of the
Jewish vote,'' said political analyst Ghassan Khattib, who heads
the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center. ``This is not good
news for the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   NO MILITARY FOR LIEBERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman avoided serving in the Vietnam War with two
deferments, one as a student and another for being a father, said
his spokesman, Eric Kleiman. Lieberman graduated from Yale College
in 1964. He attended Yale Law School for the next three years,
graduating in 1967. Al Gore served five months in Vietnam as an
Army journalist. George W. Bush served in the Texas Air National
Guard, but didn't go to Vietnam. Dick Cheney, who later was a
secretary of defense, avoided military service with deferments as a
student and expectant father.
</P>
<P>
   A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN DIXIE
</P>
<P>
   For all the kind words Joseph Lieberman is getting in Tennessee,
some Southern analysts don't see him helping Al Gore much in the
South. In fact, with the possible exception of Florida, he could
hurt. The selection of Lieberman ``is probably a signal that Gore
isn't going to make a major pitch for the South,'' said Hastings
Wyman of the Southern Political Report newsletter. Gore lags behind
George W. Bush across the South except in his home state of
Tennessee. And even Tennessee is no cakewalk for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDWATER AND THE JEWISH QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Joseph Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, as Al Gore's
running mate marks the first time a person of his faith has been
part of a major political party's national ticket. But 36 years
ago, when the late Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater was running for
president, the conservative Republican was confronted with
questions about his religion because, while he was raised an
Episcopalian, his father was Jewish. Michael Goldwater, grandfather
of the presidential candidate, was a Jewish peddler who left
Russian-ruled Poland in 1849. In his 1988 autobiography, Goldwater
wrote that it was only upon entering Washington politics that ``I
was reminded I was a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON CENTER STAGE ON OPENING NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will speak Monday night at the opening of the
Democratic convention in Los Angeles as he relinquishes the party's
leadership, making the case why Al Gore should be president and
carry on the legacy of the Clinton-Gore administration. This is no
hurry-up speech: Clinton has been testing it, refining it and
rehearsing it for months. It's the valedictory address of his
presidency, boasting of his achievements, and a political
testimonial for his hoped-for successor. And after last week's
Republican convention, it also will be an answer to George W.
Bush's jabs and barbs. Clinton will speak after his wife, Hillary,
and he'll give her Senate campaign a boost.
</P>
<P>
   BROWNE CATCHES BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   The Libertarian Party is hailing a national survey by Rasmussen
Research showing that their presidential candidate, Harry Browne,
is now tied with the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan. Each had 1.6
percent in the Rasmussen three-day rolling average of 2,250 voters.
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader garnered 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ADDRESSING PAST MISTAKES
</P>
<P>
   In a step toward atoning for what many Democrats agree was one
of their party's biggest political blunders, the sons of the late
Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey have been invited to the convention.
Casey had asked to speak at the 1992 Democratic convention and
deliver a report opposing the party's platform, which called
``reproductive choice'' a ``fundamental right.'' But the nominees _
Bill Clinton and Al Gore _ wanted the convention to send a message
of unity for abortion rights, and Casey was barred from speaking.
This year, Robert P. Casey Jr., facing re-election as
Pennsylvania's auditor general, and Patrick Casey, a candidate for
Congress, will participate in a video tribute to their father.
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELL'S TOP CAREER GOAL: FATHERHOOD
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell said he took himself out of consideration to be
Al Gore's running mate a month ago because he is having another
child. Mitchell said his wife, Heather, is 4 1/2 months pregnant
with the couple's second child. Their first, Andrew, was born in
October 1997. Mitchell, 66, a former Senate majority leader and
more recently an outside broker trying to bring peace to Northern
Ireland, reportedly was a finalist in Gore's selection process.
</P>
<P>
   YOU GO WHERE THE MONEY IS
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman lives in Connecticut, but his political money
center is New York City, where investors, insurers and accounting
firms have welcomed his support for issues like limits on lawsuits.
In building a $3.4 million campaign treasury in his Senate
re-election effort against an obscure opponent, Lieberman has
raised nearly one of every five dollars from the financial
industry, which often has been at odds with the Clinton-Gore
administration. Donors from New York City, according to an analysis
by the Center for Responsive Politics, accounted for $421,260 of
Lieberman's contributions, compared with $327,910 from those in
Hartford, the Connecticut capital.
</P>
<P>
   SURVEILLANCE BEING WATCHED, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for activists planning demonstrations during the
Democratic convention next week are demanding that the Los Angeles
Police Department halt its surveillance of the protesters'
headquarters. They said that unless authorities agree, they will go
to court Thursday to seek an injunction against the department. At
least five times in the past month, authorities have visited the
four-story building near MacArthur Park, and activists fear the
LAPD will emulate police in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., who
shut down buildings where protesters were storing banners and
puppets.

   TEENY-BOPPERS GO FOR BUSH
</P>

   Teenagers _ even those too young to vote _ readily expressed
their opinions as part of the Horatio Alger Association's annual
gauge of teen attitudes and expectations. ``The State of Our
Nation's Youth,'' a mail-in survey conducted this spring, also
showed that students overall are less worried about crime than a
year ago, and increasingly optimistic about finding jobs and
success as adults. Of the 1,334 students who responded to the
mailed survey, a majority of the 14-to-18-year-olds surveyed
favored George W. Bush. The survey didn't represent the teen
population at large: Just over half of those mailed surveys
returned them.

   IF A WOMAN CAN DO IT, WHY NOT A MAN?
</P>
<P>
   A candidate may use his wife's maiden name as his middle name on
the ballot, Minnesota Secretary of State Mary Kiffmeyer has ruled.
And it doesn't matter if it's a Scandinavian name that rings a lot
of bells in Minnesota. Greg Carlson Wersal, who is challenging
state Supreme Court Associate Justice James Gilbert, says he added
Carlson to his name when he married Cheryl Carlson. His birth name
is Gregory Fremont Wersal. ``It's fundamentally unfair to deny men
what females have been doing for years,'' Kiffmeyer said. State law
requires candidates to use their ``true name or the name by which
the candidate is commonly and generally known in the community.''

 &HT;    Back to school: Pop quiz for mom and pop
 &HT;    A practical back-to-school parental primer
 &HT;    POP'S QUIZ!
 &HT;    Practical school is now in session
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - All right, parents, let's be honest.
Let's pull no punches. Let's tell it like it is.
</P>
<P>
   School's about to start, and it's about dang time!
</P>
<P>
   No more hacking paychecks in half to finance cutesy camps where
wee ones waste weeks weaving coasters out of Popsicle sticks. No
more toiling till sunset while your surly teen snores till noon,
then scarfs $15 worth of cold cuts and falls asleep again. Best of
all, no more bedtime BS. That's right, tykes. Whine all you want.
From now till June, the practical parent will have but one refrain:
</P>
<P>
   ``Get in bed, boy! You've got school in the morning!''
</P>
<P>
   To make sure you get the most out of the new school year _ and
do right by your kids _ the practical man will now enlarge your
minds with his Back to School Lessons for Practical Parents. Take a
seat, folks. School's in session.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 1 _ Arithmetic: One and one is two. Two and two is four.
When Billy blubbers about taking the bus, kick his bony butt out
the door.
</P>
<P>
   While equations this advanced may melt some minds _ especially
those of softhearted moms _ trust the practical man, they must be
learned. Those who fail to grasp their intricacies will quickly
find themselves in a remedial class, ciphering the following
brainbuster:
</P>
<P>
   Four and two is six. Six and two is eight. Drive Billy to school
today, and you'll be driving him till he graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 2 _ Reading: Spot is a dog. See Spot run. Sally feeds
Spot in the morning, or Sally's evenings ain't no fun.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, interpreting this dense passage is no job for a
beginning literary critic, but the practical man urges you to read
it over and think it through. What was the author feeling when he
wrote these words? What is the underlying meaning? Is he talking
about some particular child, Sally, and that child's dog, Spot? Or
is he speaking allegorically, aiming at a more universal truth?
</P>
<P>
   Need a hint? Here it is: Do your chores before you roam, or deal
with Dad when you get home.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 3 _ Spelling: I before E, except after C. A before D, if
you want to watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   Pithy proverbs such as these are powerful learning tools, but
they take parental interaction to reach their potential. If Billy's
teacher is a Whole Language disciple who lets him forget that I and
E are letters, for instance, he should be grateful for the knock on
the noggin he ``recieves'' from his concerned pop. Similarly, if
Sally forgets that A and D are grades, she'll understand when mom
torpedoes the tube and hounds her about homework.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 4 _ Physics: Newton's laws of motion are slippery devils,
but a good teacher can tame them with concrete examples. Take notes
while the practical man demonstrates.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``An object at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by
an unbalanced force'': Let that teen-ager sprawled on your couch be
the object at rest. The unbalanced force would then be you,
clutching the teen's car keys and bellowing, ``Cut the grass, or
walk to class!'' Trust Newton, motion is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Acceleration equals force divided by mass'': In practical
parenting terms, this can be restated thus: The rate at which Billy
gets cracking on his book report (acceleration) depends upon the
size of your shoe (force) and the breadth of his backside (mass).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Every action prompts an equal and opposite reaction'': Say
your daughter demands $300 to go to Disney with the high school
band. That would be an action. Say you demand she help you paint
the house on the next three weekends. That would be an equal and
opposite reaction _ for which, coincidentally, you'll pay her
exactly $300.
</P>
<P>
   Pop Quiz: Close your books, class. The practical man will now
test what you've learned.
</P>
<P>
   1. Oh no! Your eighth-grade daughter has a boyfriend. You've
said no dating till she's 15, so now she ties up the phone for
hours every night prattling with her pimply prince. What do you do?
</P>
<P>
   A) Put in a second phone line. Your little girl is becoming a
young woman and she needs her space.
</P>
<P>
   B) Institute the laundry-for-phone-privileges rule: ``She who
flirts folds some shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   C) Snatch the phone out of her hand and bellow: ``Do you feel
lucky? Well, do ya, punk?''
</P>
<P>
   2. Your 10th-grader is taking algebra and needs help with his
homework. You can't remember anything about it. How do you help
him?
</P>
<P>
   A) Hire a tutor. There's no problem money can't solve.
</P>
<P>
   B) Swipe his book and give yourself a crash course. It'll be
good for both of you.
</P>
<P>
   C) Throw up your hands and bellow: ``I just don't see how X and
Y can be numbers!''
</P>
<P>
   3. Your sixth-grader comes home crying. The kids are laughing at
the Air Jordan knockoffs you bought him. He says he needs a $90
pair of sneakers or he'll never be cool. What do you say, practical
pop?
</P>
<P>
   A) OK. The shoes aren't worth $90, but your child's happiness
is.
</P>
<P>
   B) It's up to him, but $90 is a lot of yard work.
</P>
<P>
   C) ``Forget the feet, boy, and check out these hand-to-hand
combat moves I learned in the Marines! ``
</P>
<P>
   4. Good news: Your fourth-grader is all excited because she got
an ``Excellent!!!!'' on her essay. Bad news: When you read her
paper, you notice she's misspelled half the words and apparently
doesn't know a comma from a compost pile. What's a practical parent
to do?
</P>
<P>
   A) Congratulate her and hush. You don't want to damage her
budding self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   B) Congratulate her and take tomorrow afternoon off. Her
teacher's going to explain.
</P>
<P>
   C) Congratulate yourself on this brilliant plan: She's going to
do that thing over and do it right!
</P>
<P>
   Scoring: B), B), B), B). OK, so that was kind of cheap, but if
you think the practical man is going to waste time scrambling
answers around, you've still got a lot to learn.

FOR BRIDGESTONE, FIRESTONE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
 (With TIRE-RECALL) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Ever since Bridgestone Corp. bought Firestone in one of
the many high-profile Japanese takeovers of the 1980s, the United
States tire maker has been a problem child.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone, the world's second-largest tire producer after the
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., paid $2.6 billion for Firestone in
1988 and spent billions more to expand its faltering operations,
reduce heavy debt and trim fat. The initial results were
disappointing as Firestone sustained big losses, failed to increase
its market share and suffered from a bitter labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Firestone seemed to be growing up, its tire sales to
auto dealers accelerating in recent years, the company announced a
recall on Wednesday of 6.55 million tires that are the subject of a
U.S. government safety investigation into at least 46 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The tire recall, though not nearly as extensive as the 14
million-tire recall Firestone made in the 1970s is expected to cost
Bridgestone as much as $500 million, according to estimates by
industry analysts, and is potentially damaging to the Firestone
brand name. Some analysts have predicted that the company will
suffer a loss in market share, especially since many of the tire
accidents under investigation involved Ford Explorer sports utility
vehicles that are popular with families.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of the recall, which have been circulating in Tokyo for
several days, sent Bridgestone shares tumbling in heavy trading on
Wednesday in anticipation of a company announcement in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone's stock declined 8.2 percent to 2,075 yen or about
$19.20 at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares have dropped 17 percent since reports
surfaced last week that consumer groups considered the tires
unsafe, and Sears, Roebuck and Co., America's largest retailer,
stopped selling the tires in question. Bridgestone has made 48
million of the tires since it began manufacturing them in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Bridgestone, which had operating profit of
$2.18 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, could easily
absorb the initial impact of the recall but some expressed concern
about the long-term, which they said will be largely determined by
the outcome of the government's investigation and whether Firestone
can escape the stigma of a tainted brand.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry is being conducted by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, which has received 270 complaints, including
reports of 46 deaths and 80 injuries, concerning malfunctioning
Firestone truck tires.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone has recalled tires before. In 1978, the company
recalled 14 million of its 500-series tires that suffered tread
separations and blowouts. Government regulators also fined the
company $500,000 for concealing the safety problems. Partly as a
result of the recall, Firestone suffered major financial problems
and was later acquired by Bridgestone.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone, which is headquartered in Tokyo, declined to
comment, referring all inquiries to its Firestone division in the
United States. While Bridgestone sought to portray the situation as
largely an American problem, Firestone accounted for 40 percent of
the parent company's consolidated sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have criticized Japanese companies for being slow
to respond to difficulties faced by their U.S. operations that have
resulted in public relations nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Toshiba Corp. agreed to spend about $1 billion to
settle a class-action lawsuit contending the company, which is the
world's leading maker of laptop computers, had sold 5 million
defective machines in the United States since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mitsubushi Motors Corp. agreed to several steps to
improve job opportunities for women and minorities, but only after
the U.S. government brought one of the country's largest sexual
harassment suits against its American subsidiary and civil rights
activists threatened a car boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Daiwa Bank, one of the biggest banks in Japan, also has been
haunted by a failure to fix problems at its U.S. operations. In
1996 Daiwa pleaded guilty to criminal charges that its managers had
covered up more than $1 billion in trading losses at the bank's New
York branch over many years. The bank agreed to pay a record $340
million in fines and was ordered to stop doing business in the
United States.

ECONOMIC SCENE: RICH OR POOR, WE`VE ALL MADE PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
 (Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason magazine and the
author of ``The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over
Creativity, Enterprise, and Progress.'') 
 By VIRGINIA POSTREL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting
poorer, right? You'll hear that familiar riff frequently this
election year, if not from the major party candidates then from
Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan. It's a populist truism, Exhibit A in
the case against the economy's recent dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   But what if increasing inequality is mostly a myth _ an artifact
of misleading data and changing lifestyles? What if just about
everyone is getting richer?
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of
Egalitarianism'' (University of Chicago Press), the iconoclastic
economic historian Robert Fogel makes just that case. Fogel, of the
University of Chicago, won the 1993 Nobel Prize for his revisionist
empirical work on such topics as the economics of slavery and the
development of the railroads. Here, he marshals data not just on
income but on spending, time use, calorie consumption and health
measures like life expectancy and height.
</P>
<P>
   What he finds is good news indeed: a century of stunning
material progress and improved physical well-being in the United
States and the rest of the industrialized world. Poorer people have
been the big winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every measure that we have bearing on the standard of
living, such as real income, homelessness, life expectancy and
height, the gains of the lower classes have been far greater than
those experienced by the population as a whole, whose overall
standard of living has also improved,'' Fogel writes.
</P>
<P>
   Most strikingly, technical and economic progress has bought us
more time; we live longer, healthier lives and enjoy much more time
to do what we want rather than what we must. In this, he notes in
his book, the poor have gained the most. A century ago, the lower
your income, the more hours a year you worked to earn it _ a
depressing prospect. Today, it's just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the basics cost very little time. In 1880, for
instance, covering a typical household's annual food bills cost
1,405 hours of labor, or about a half-year's wages back then, and
those hours didn't include substantial unpaid time in the kitchen.
A year's worth of food now costs a mere 260 hours of labor, and
that price buys much greater variety and convenience, including a
lot of restaurant meals.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that Americans work many fewer hours each year.
The free time of a typical working man has tripled over the last
century. He now spends more time at leisure (not including
sleeping, eating, commuting, chores and other basic activities)
than at work. Women have enjoyed similar gains in leisure, mostly
because they have a lot less housework.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, life expectancy has increased 10 years just since
1950, mostly because people over 65 are living much longer. The age
at which chronic problems like heart disease and arthritis set in
keeps becoming later, and the effect of those ailments is less
debilitating. This trend means many more active retirement years,
which further adds to the huge increase in free time.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the rising inequality we hear so much about? Fogel
argues that what looks like bad news over the last couple of
decades mostly reflects individuals' different choices about how to
use all this free time.
</P>
<P>
   Take two men in the same occupation. One chooses to work long
hours during middle age _ earning lots of overtime, advancing to
the top corporate or partnership ranks or making it big in the
start-up game _ so he can retire at 55. Another takes a more
laid-back approach, avoiding the time commitments that would
maximize his income and spending more time with his family and
hobbies. He works until he's 65. Over the course of their lives,
they may make about the same income. But in any given year, their
incomes will be significantly different because of their choices
about when to take their free time. This pattern intensifies when
you add spouses pursuing similarly divergent choices.
</P>
<P>
   In an appendix to Fogel's book, Chulhee Lee, a former research
associate at the University of Chicago and now an assistant
professor at Seoul National University in Korea, presents strong
evidence that increases in these sorts of variations account for
much of what looks like a rise in income inequality from 1969 to
1989. Changes in how many heads of households and their spouses
worked, and how many hours they worked, accounted for 54 percent of
the increase in the spread between the highest 10 percent of
household incomes and the lowest 10 percent. Changing wages, by
contrast, accounted for less than 6 percent of the increase in the
gap.
</P>
<P>
   You might think these are signs of widespread, permanent
unemployment among lower-income people. But Lee found evidence to
the contrary. As of 1994, 80 percent of the people in the bottom 10
percent of incomes were spending more than they earned, a sharp
increase from about 53 percent in 1972-73. And the amount that 80
percent spent was about twice their incomes. Incomes look more
lopsided, but the ratio of spending between the richest and poorest
deciles has barely budged over time.
</P>
<P>
   How can poor people spend significantly more than they earn?
``You don't go to a bank and say, `I'm very poor but worthy _
please give me some money,''' Fogel said. Most likely, he said,
they are using savings to finance either transient unemployment,
which may be voluntary, or early retirement. Only a few of the
poorest people stay poor over time, and the same is true for the
richest, who tend to be at the peak of their earning years.
</P>
<P>
   This evidence suggests that the apparent increase in inequality
exists because more people with financial assets are taking breaks
from work. That doesn't mean poverty has disappeared, of course,
though its material hardships have lessened significantly. But it
does suggest that identifying the real problems of the poor _ as
most people understand that term _ requires a lot more nuance than
aggregated income statistics provide. Focusing on snapshot
inequality rather than on long-term life opportunities leads us to
underestimate the country's enormous material progress and to
overemphasize money as the solution to hard-core poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than worry about material inequality, Fogel says, we
should concern ourselves with the alienation that keeps a minority
of the statistically poor from enjoying the self-realization our
abundant time makes possible. Deciding what to do with that time,
he argues, is something Americans of all income levels now face.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he says: ``People have the same problem that only the
rich had, and that is, what do you do with your life? What is the
good life? That was, from Socrates' time until the beginning of the
20th century, only an issue for the rich. Now it's becoming an
issue for ordinary people. If you worked 3,000 hours a year, you
didn't have a lot of time to wonder what to do wth your life.''

BLOW THE WHISTLE, HONEY, WHEN A PICTURE COMES IN
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM S. NIEDERKORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here's the dish about the dish. The dish on our roof.
The dish that got us out from under the cable monopoly:
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy putting it there. And it was more expensive than
we thought.
</P>
<P>
   A few of us still remember when television was free. It used to
be delivered by an antenna on top of the set, but a good picture of
that sort hasn't been seen in Manhattan since S. Klein's on the
Square.
</P>
<P>
   So we had to have cable. The first unfree television bill was a
few dollars a month. But cable's channel packages kept changing,
and to keep AMC, Bravo, TNT and other channels our household likes,
we had to pay more. And more and more.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the Time Warner Cable bill exceeding $40 a month,
without premium channels _ no ``Sopranos,'' no ``Sex and the
City,'' no pay-per-view movies _ I joined the cable monopoly
revolt. I made a call and said, ``Give me the dish!''
</P>
<P>
   I'd seen offers for free satellite television systems. But the
one that caught my eye came in the e-mail in June from a DirecTV
dealer. It was $29 for the system (I'd seen other systems for $99
or more), plus one year of service at a monthly rate of $21.99 for
about 40 channels.
</P>
<P>
   Under ``terms'' the e-mail message added a caveat: The system
had to be activated within 30 days, or we would be charged $299 for
the equipment. A month seemed plenty of time. But installing it was
something less than direct.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a city guy. I was an Eagle Scout. I compose music in my free
time, and I built my own Web site. This would be a piece of cake.
The only problem seemed to be whether our landlord would allow a
satellite dish on the roof. He gave me the go-ahead _ he was ready
to join the revolt, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the toll-free number for Standard Satellite, the seller in
the e-mail message, I quickly closed the deal with a telephone
salesclerk.
</P>
<P>
   For $35 more, she would even send along a package with
``everything needed'' to install the dish myself: 100 feet of RG-6
cable, a compass, an instructional videotape and other items that
sounded promising.
</P>
<P>
   Still waiting for delivery from Standard Satellite a week after
the order _ and with the meter running _ I phoned again. A
different salesclerk answered and assured me that the company was
not out to get customers for the $299; the penalty was just to
prevent people from ordering the system and using it with another
company. I'd measured the distance from my television set to where
the landlord suggested I put the dish. I'd need 175 feet of cable.
But Standard Satellite could provide only what came in the kit, she
said. And it was not, in fact, a nice continuous 100 feet of cable,
but two pieces of cable: 75 feet and 25 feet. She told me I could
buy more cable at a store like Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   On the ninth day after I placed the order, two packages arrived:
a big one with the dish and the receiver, and a small one with the
installation kit. It was somewhat of a shock to find that the
instructional videotape showed a young couple installing the dish
in a rural or suburban one-story, single-family dwelling. My
fantasy had been that the tape would show how to install it in a
city apartment building. Just as disconcerting was the introductory
part of the video, which listed the supposed contents of the $35
kit.
</P>
<P>
   There were the promised pieces of cable, four plastic wire ties,
a compass, four lag screws, a ground block, 15 feet of ground wire,
25 feet of phone wire, a 6-foot video cable and a dual connector
for the phone so that DirecTV could monitor the receiver for
billing purposes. But where were the washers, the lead-shield
expansion anchors, the ground clamp, nail clips, the tube of
silicon sealant, the in-line coupler, the 6-foot stereo audiovideo
cable, the protractor and the two feed-through bushings _ all of
which the video also inventoried? And by the way, what were
feed-through bushings? (They're plastic caps used to shield cable
when it passes through the outside wall of a suburban ranch house.)
</P>
<P>
   I called the dealer and got the first phone clerk again. After
at first insisting that the kit contained everything I would
require to install the dish, she finally conceded that it contained
everything the company had determined was needed. And if there was
anything else I needed, I could just go get it myself.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks a lot.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of stonewall you'd expect if you unwittingly
bought gray-market goods and tried to return them.
</P>
<P>
   I spent $25 on a 100-foot length of cable and a cable coupler at
Radio Shack and $20 or so at the hardware store for a masonry drill
bit, wire ties, washers and expansion anchors, which would hold the
screws in the brick wall where I was putting up the dish. I had to
buy two 50-foot extension cords for our old electric drill, to
reach from our fourth-floor apartment to the roof above our
six-story building. For $5 each at Odd Lots, that beat buying a
cordless drill for $65 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the fun part. The video proved to be just about
useless. Fortunately, the main dish package came with printed
instructions, and the DirecTV Web site had good suggestions.
Drilling the holes into the roof wall was good for the biceps.
Getting the dish up, and running the cable down to our apartment,
would not challenge anyone who has passed Erector Set merit badge.
The instructions weren't too clear about attaching the ground wire.
But four phone calls later, even that problem was solved, and I
grounded the system to a radiator. (Think of Ben Franklin flying
his kite with a key attached to the string.)
</P>
<P>
   Next came something harder: Aiming the dish. I'd done Franklin;
now I needed Admiral Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Relative to the Earth, DirecTV's satellite is a stationary
object in space. It orbits at the same speed as the Earth turns, so
it seems to be in one place in the sky all the time. I had to aim
the dish at exactly this spot, using the compass that comes with
the kit, which is about the size of the Sacajawea dollar _ but far
less valuable.
</P>
<P>
   A trusty assistant is essential for this phase of the
installation, and if your apartment is a few floors from where you
are putting the dish, I recommend placing her near a window and
equipping her with a whistle loud enough to be heard on the roof,
where you will be stationed dishside with a socket wrench and that
precision compass. She will also have to run back and forth from
the window to the television, which is no harder to connect to the
satellite receiver than it was to the cable box. Using a remote
control unit, she can bring up a menu on screen that shows the
strength of the satellite signal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when it comes to aiming the dish, the DirecTV Web site's
help pages say, ``We highly recommend that you have it
professionally installed.'' But there was no turning back now.
</P>
<P>
   This was my first time dealing with terms like ``elevation'' and
``azimuth'' coordinates. You enter your ZIP code on DirecTV's
dish-pointer Web page, or you can do it through the satellite
receiver on the TV. In my case, the azimuth was 231.8, meaning that
if I put the compass needle on N, I should point the dish at 231.8
degrees, or over toward the southwest. My elevation coordinate
turned up as 35.5 degrees, or about a third of the way up from the
horizon to the zenith.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the Wright brothers found at Kitty Hawk, it was trial and
error, with me clambering up and down the super's ladder from the
top of the elevator shaft to the roof, where I could yell down to
the apartment and hear how we were doing.
</P>
<P>
   I started at 32 degrees, by using a scale etched in the arm
holding the dish, and swept the dish around, horizontally, in an
arc of 30 degrees or so, hoping to hear a whistle from three
stories below. When that pass didn't succeed, I raised the
elevation half a degree and repeated the routine. After numerous
tries, I heard the eureka whistle. Like Houston suddenly making
contact with astronauts coming round the dark side of the moon, the
picture came in. For a few days, we made adjustments until our
signal strength was above 90. (Anything over 70 is considered OK)
</P>
<P>
   So you may be wondering, then, was it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the satellite picture is better than cable's. For $10
more, or a monthly total of $31.99 to DirecTV, we get Total Choice
_ 100-plus channels, which include almost all the cable-only
stations that Time Warner offers with its Standard-plus-MetroChoice
package and more besides: I'm delighted with the international news
channels and programs like ``Ground Break'' on BBC America. In one
episode, a hardy band of landscapers and a droll narrator help a
woman create a surprise for her husband, who is away on a trip. In
a half-hour of airtime, they add a decorative pool, a boardwalk, a
row of cedars and other fine touches to a formerly barren backyard.
And Trio, a Canadian channel with a horde of dramatic series,
showed a beautiful print of Fellini's ``Casanova'' the other night,
without commercial interruption.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV's competitor, the Dish Network, has a similar deal
called America's Top 100, for $29.99 a month. Each company's
package contains about 15 channels that the competitor does not
carry. And both packages include over 30 channels not in Time
Warner's comparably priced Basic-plus-Standard-plus-MetroChoice
package.
</P>
<P>
   But for local channels, Time Warner has the satellite services
beat. Satellite TV does not offer New York 1 (Time Warner's own
channel), nor the local PBS station, Channel 13, nor even WWOR,
Channel 9. In fact, you don't get local channels from DirecTV at
all unless you pay $5.99 more, and then they are only national
versions of CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC and PBS, along with WPIX.
</P>
<P>
   We can't do without CUNY-TV, the Crosswalks stations and the
Manhattan Neighborhood Cable stations, so we've decided to keep
Time Warner Basic service for the local stations, at about $15 a
month. With our satellite connection that gives us all but half a
dozen of the channels we used to have with Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we cut about $25 off our Time Warner Cable bill. The
bottom line is, we have better quality and more variety, but our
monthly television bill is about $5 less free than it used to be.
</P>

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I often use aerosol spray cans of paint in my workshop when
doing small jobs.
 &HT;    After each use I turn the can upside down and spray out a little
paint to clear the nozzle, but sometimes even this procedure does
not prevent the nozzle from clogging before the next use.
 &HT;    Any suggestions as to what I can do to clear the nozzle when
this does happen, and what else I can do to prevent this?
 &HT;    A: It's likely that when you invert the can to spray excess
paint out of the nozzle you do not spray long enough to completely
clear out all the paint. You should spray until no more paint comes
out.
 &HT;    To clear a nozzle that is already clogged here is a method that
often works:
 &HT;    Pull the nozzle off the spray can and soak it for several hours
in paint thinner.
 &HT;    Then use a needle or pin to scrape out as much of the softened
paint as you can from the bottom end of the nozzle (where it fits
onto the spray can).
 &HT;    Press this nozzle onto the far end of the snorkel-type thin tube
that comes with most aerosol lubricants. Connect the other end of
this tube to the lubricant nozzle.
 &HT;    Squirt a small blast of the penetrating oil into and through the
paint-can nozzle to clear it completely.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I have a mahogany dining room table, but the top is not solid
mahogany _ it is a mahogany wood veneer.
 &HT;    The finish on the veneer is quite dull and there are a number of
small pieces missing. There are also several cracks in the surface
and the top has not been waxed for years.
 &HT;    Can I refinish this table top by sanding and varnishing in the
usual manner?
 &HT;    A: Sanding would be problematic because the veneer is likely to
be too thin to take much sanding.
 &HT;    You can try sanding with the finest grain sandpaper but work
carefully to avoid going through the veneer.
 &HT;    The cracks can be filled with a matching wood putty, but the
patches would show and there is still little you can do about the
missing pieces of veneer.
 &HT;    My suggestion would be to forget about refinishing this table
top. Either cover it with a new layer of thin mahogany plywood
(which can then be varnished) or cover it with a plastic laminate
such as Formica.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I am refinishing some tables and chairs that have round legs
and spokes. Sanding by machine is impossible.
 &HT;    I have also been told not to use steel wool because this often
leaves little particles of steel that will get into the wood and
the finish.
 &HT;    How can I hand-sand and smooth these round legs without using
steel wool and without creating flat spots in the wood?
 &HT;    A: You actually can use steel wool, but you will have to be
careful to get all of the small metal fibers out of the wood after
you are done (these can leave little rust spots in the finish). But
using steel wool will also take longer.
 &HT;    A better method is to cut the sandpaper into strips, then back
each strip with masking tape or duct tape cut to size.
 &HT;    These strips of abrasive paper can then be wrapped halfway
around each leg and ``seesawed'' back and forth from different
directions. The wood or finish can thus be sanded without creating
any flat spots.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Glasses or plates left on the marble top of my coffee table
often leave spots that are almost impossible to remove.
 &HT;    Do you know how I can remove them and what I can apply to this
marble to protect it against such staining?
 &HT;    A: Marble stains easily because it is actually very porous. That
is why most marble tops have a sealer applied after installation.
 &HT;    However, even with a sealer, spills and stains should be mopped
up promptly because removing them later on can often be much more
difficult _ depending on the type of stain and how old it is.
 &HT;    You can try using a marble cleaning kit that you can buy from a
local hardware store or marble dealer. These kits have various
solvents and cleaning agents in them for removing different types
of stains.
 &HT;    Otherwise you may have to bring the marble in to a dealer to
have it professionally polished and refinished.
 &HT;    To protect against future staining, apply a marble sealer that
you can buy from the dealer, and then coat this with a white paste
wax at regular intervals thereafter.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``CLEARING PAINT NOZZLE'' goes with this
column.
 &HT;    CAPTION: Blasting penetrating lubricant through a clogged
paint-spray nozzle will often clear it out.

WHEN WOMEN CALLED THE TUNES 
</HEADLINE>
  By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They called Viola Smith the Female Gene Krupa for the way she
would hurl her drumstick onto her drum, then jump up in the air and
catch it as it bounced. Clora Bryant dazzled them with her trumpet
solos. Roz Cron was known for the beautiful, clear tone and
distinct phrasing of her alto sax and clarinet.
</P>
<P>
   They were stars of the so-called all-girl bands that played the
dance halls and USO stages of World War II while the men were off
at war. They played in groups like Phil Spitalny's ``Hour of
Charm,'' the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, Ada Leonard's
All-American Girls and the Prairie View Coeds.
</P>
<P>
   But when the war ended, their glory faded. As men resumed their
musical careers, the all-girl bands gradually broke up. Some women
went on to careers playing in small groups or as soloists, but it
was never the same. Never again would so many women play together
to such appreciative mass audiences. They were ``Swing Shift
Maisies'' _ like Rosie the Riveter, substitutes for the real thing:
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men felt like: `Girl musicians, what are they doing on the
road? It's a male job,''' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only God can make a tree,'' the swing historian George T.
Simon wrote in ``The Big Bands'' (1967, London: Macmillan), ``and
only men can play good jazz.'' In many ways, Simon's has been the
prevailing view.
</P>
<P>
   But in a book published last month, ``Swing Shift'' (Duke
University Press), Sherrie Tucker, assistant professor of women's
studies at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, has recaptured the
faded history of the all-girl bands. It is a study of how women
negotiated boundaries of gender and race to play jazz and adapted
their dress and music to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ```Swing Shift' is about the construction of what is a jazz
musician and what is a worker,'' she said, ``how women didn't fit
the categories and couldn't be seen as authentic musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is also about how race affected the bands. Black and
white groups were often perceived as having their own distinct
sounds. Some white women wanted to play jazz so much that they
passed for African-American so they could tour with black groups in
the South. And in traveling together, eating together, sharing
hotel rooms, Tucker says, the black and white women of the all-girl
bands played an important role in paving the way for desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz's long blue notes, its wild drum crescendos, have always
been thought of as male sounds. The very essence of the form, the
jam session, is based on one-upmanship. The all-girl bands of World
War II had to ``project popular forms of femininity at the same
time music that was authentic jazz was thought of as masculine,''
Tucker said. ``It was almost like a juggling act, because they were
trying to get the categories to overlap so that people wouldn't
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, women's jazz groups before the war, but
they were viewed as ``a kind of sex show,'' Tucker said. And during
the war, female groups were not seen as professionals either, but
as ``patriotic, temporary musical groups to entertain the
soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the musicians' union pressured bands to hire
returning veterans, and many women were funneled into ``pink
collar'' jobs as beauticians, waitresses, teachers. Some played the
organ for church choirs. The women who continued in jazz ``were
often stigmatized by men as gay, as women often are who assume male
jobs,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The first problem a woman had was even getting to play a
``male'' instrument like the trumpet or drums, Tucker said. They
usually got their start in high school bands or because male
relatives inspired them.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the drummer, got her break during the late 1920s and '30s
in the Schmitz Sisters, a family orchestra in Wisconsin organized
by her father. ``Other girl musicians had a tough time getting
started,'' said Smith, who lives in Manhattan. After the Schmitz
Sisters disbanded, she and a sister formed the Coquettes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who declined to give her age, was careful to dress
femininely in chiffon because, she said, ``anybody doing a male
job, they would think `Oh, she must be tough.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Smith joined Phil Spitalny's ``Hour of Charm,'' the
most mainstream and commercially successful of the all-girl bands.
The Spitalny sound was orchestral, ``feminized'' with harps and
strings, Tucker said. The women wore formal gowns and projected an
aura of sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   The same year that she joined Spitalny, Smith published an
editorial in Down Beat magazine, ``Give Girl Musicians a Break!''
Instead of replacing the male musicians who had been drafted with
mediocre male talent, ``Why not let some of the great girl
musicians of the country take their place?''
</P>
<P>
   By the war's end, Smith had wearied of life on the road,
traveling all night between engagements and then having to look
glamorous. Car accidents were common. Gasoline was rationed and
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Big bands in general were being disbanded, and Americans were
staying home to watch television.
</P>
<P>
   Smith continued playing, mostly club dates. She was a drummer in
``Cabaret'' on Broadway for three years. After that she did summer
theater, until 1974. She didn't want to play one-night stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``No male orchestra would book me,'' she said. ``You definitely
had to prove yourself more. They were very leery: `How can girl
musicians do the job?'''
</P>
<P>
   Clora Bryant, the jazz trumpeter, got her start at 15 in
Denison, Texas, when she borrowed her brother's trumpet. Her father
``went in the bedroom and cried because I was so good,'' she said
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who is black, was accepted at Oberlin College, but chose
Prairie View College in Texas, a historically black institution,
because of its all-girl band, the Prairie View Coeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Prairie View Coeds were known for improvising. Many, though
not all, black all-girl bands emphasized improvisation, Tucker
said, while many white groups emphasized arrangements. Poorer bands
_ black or white _ couldn't afford to have arrangements written for
them, and black bands were often poor. Emphasis on the second and
fourth beats was also associated with blacks, while four even beats
and sticking to the melody were associated with whites.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, conditions were tougher for black groups.
Accommodations were inferior. In the Jim Crow South there was
police surveillance. Blacks couldn't stay in white hotels. Food was
hard to get, and the pay was lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as a club was doing good, they would fire the black
group, hire a white group and pay them more,'' Bryant said. ``Then
the club would fail and they'd hire another black group.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1944 Bryant played the Apollo Theater in New York, ``one of
the highlights of my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the war's end, many women married and left the bands. ``The
men were still holding onto the jobs, trying to hold us back,''
Bryant said. But ``my dad taught me to be aggressive and
assertive.''
</P>
<P>
   After her family moved to Los Angeles in 1945, she played on
Central Avenue, which was a center of jazz in the city, with
Hampton Hawes and Sonny Criss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked all the time,'' she said. She traveled with a smaller
all-female group called the Queens of Swing. She was in ``The
Chicks and the Fiddle,'' a television variety show featuring an
all-girl band in 1951, but it lasted just six weeks. In 1957 she
made a record, ``Gal With a Horn,'' (recently reissued in CD by
VSOP).
</P>
<P>
   ``If she'd been a man, with her talents she would have made more
records,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   During the '80s Bryant played with jazz greats like Bill Berry,
Johnny Otis and Billy Williams, and Dizzy Gillespie took her under
his wing. In 1989 she performed in Russia at the invitation of
Mikhail Gorbachev. In recent years, Bryant has produced jazz
concerts, including one in 1993 honoring Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   Today Bryant is 73 and recovering from heart surgery, but ``I'm
still kind of touring,'' she said. ``It's in my blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Roz Cron, who played the alto sax and clarinet, got her start in
her high school band in Boston. After graduating, she played with
Ada Leonard's All-American Girl Orchestra, led by a former
stripper.
</P>
<P>
   The group was successful, Tucker writes, because it combined
wholesomeness and glamour. Initially the band had a smooth sound,
but it became jazzier, more swing. At the same time, the costumes
became softer, ``as if to ensure the band's overall reception as
acceptably feminine,'' Tucker writes.
</P>
<P>
   Cron didn't like wearing evening gowns. ``I felt it categorized
us,'' she said. ``I felt all the men were out there playing in
their shirts and ties, just looking very professional, and we were
just prancing around in ruffles. And it was very uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cron, who is white, was invited to join a black group, the
International Sweethearts of Rhythm. Most bands were segregated by
race, but she accepted because ``I just wanted to play,'' she said.
``When I joined the Sweethearts I knew I had come home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sweethearts usually wore jackets, white shirts and skirts.
But mostly, she loved their sound, its ``aggressive, strong
drive.'' She preferred it, she told Tucker in the book, to the
``uptight white rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sweethearts were also somewhat unusual in having an
arranger, Maurice King, an alto sax player who later became a force
at Motown Records. ``He was just a genius and wrote beautifully,''
Cron said.
</P>
<P>
   When the group toured the South, she passed for black so she
could go with them. Fraternizing between blacks and whites could
lead to arrest, so Cron, permed her hair to make it kinky and wore
dark makeup in a process the women called browning down. ``I mostly
just stayed in the background,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in El Paso, Cron was arrested for walking with a black
soldier. The women had learned to manipulate Southern racial
prejudice, sometimes to their advantage. The subject of white men
raping black women, and of sexual relations between the races in
general, was taboo. Light-skinned blacks were a reminder of it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to embarrass the police into releasing her, Bryant told
the officer that her mother was black and her father white. He
didn't believe her, and she was jailed. The next morning two
light-skinned black colleagues from the Sweethearts arrived,
pretending to be her cousins, and she was released.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war Cron left the band. The pay was poor, and
she was tired of traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rosie the Riveters who had held men's jobs during the
war, Cron found her opportunities drying up. Returning soldiers
were getting the band jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played off and on, taking one step forward and two
backward,'' she said. ``I studied clarinet very diligently when I
went home. I couldn't find any work, and worked in a bank. And then
I met my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   After a nine-year silence, she resumed playing in a community
orchestra in Santa Monica, Calif. ``I just turned 75,'' Cron said.
``I've had two surgeries.'' The operations forced her to stop
performing for a time, and have made playing difficult. ``Now I
believe I'm going to play for myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact,'' she added, ``I picked up the clarinet
last week.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Cron was a founder of Maiden Voyage, an all-female
jazz band that continues to perform. Such bands enjoyed a
resurgence during the '60s and '70s, partly because of the women's
movement, but their audiences were mostly women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time when I see all-women bands playing, it's in a
women's jazz festival,'' Tucker said. ``They still get told,
`You're the first woman I've ever seen play the trumpet.'
</P>
<P>
   ``A band of women is never just a band,'' she said. ``It's
always exotic.''

   MEXICO-ABORTION _ MEXICO CITY _ Women have erupted into protest
over a new anti-abortion law in Mexican President-elect Vicente
Fox's home state of Guanajuato. Last week, that state's local
congress suddenly passed by one vote a new provision of the
criminal code that makes abortion illegal even in the case of rape.
The vote provoked a crisis in Fox's party, the conservative
National Action, the PAN, which, along with Fox, has portrayed
itself as more middle-of-the-road of late. The PAN's national
leadership was angered by the vote _ some openly denounced it _ and
Fox distanced himself from the action by saying he had no intention
of pursuing such a ban. Opponents say the current PAN governor of
Guanajuato has an option to veto the law, which he might do, or
other legislators will put up a fight to have it struck down.
Abortion is illegal in Mexico, but in all states it can be sought
in the case of rape. Just as Fox is preparing to take office Dec.
1, the PAN has been damaged. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

to calm rising tensions here Wednesday about the possibility of
more terrorist acts in Russia's capital, while authorities made
little headway into finding out who was responsible for Tuesday's
blast that killed seven and wounded close to 100. Authorities
believe it was the work of Chechen rebels fighting for independence
in Russia's breakaway southern republic. Putin told the nation that
Russia would fight back against terrorism with ``a response in
kind,'' and with vigorously continue the war in Chechnya. (Coker,

   BAT-PROJECT _ SAN LUIS VALLEY, Colo. _ When San Luis Valley
residents wake up each morning, there are 2 tons fewer bugs outside
than there were the night before. Tons of bugs disappear each
night, especially in summer, not that the farmers mind. They're
glad, and so is everyone else. And the fact that they have bats to
thank for the insect eradication doesn't seem to bother anyone.
Bats, it turns out, aren't the bloodthirsty villains often
portrayed in books and movies. They're vital to many Colorado
ecosystems and, in the case of the San Luis Valley, vital to the
economy because of crops saved from insects. And bats are being
unintentionally exterminated. Throughout the United States,
destruction of bat habitat is driving them into abandoned mines. In
the last 20 years, mines have been closed to ensure public safety,
but with little thought to the bats possibly living inside. (Grand

14 pints of beer a day as a teenager _ apparently in a bid to

ADVERTISING: AN UPSTART INVESTMENT BANK TRIES TO CARVE OUT A
NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By BERNARD STAMLER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They don't sell consumer goods. Although they are financial
institutions, they don't have street-level branches, tellers or ATM
machines. Many people have no idea what they do, and few of them
will ever interact directly with one, even if they do.
</P>
<P>
   So just how do you advertise an investment bank?
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the answer was simple: with ``tombstones,'' the
somber boxes in the financial press that announce this big deal or
that, complete or in the works. But that was before the Internet
economy and its lucrative initial public offerings changed
everything, inspiring heightened competition among the players in a
once buttoned-down industry. Nowadays, extensive display and
broadcast ad campaigns have become the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to join the fray: Robertson Stephens, the upstart San
Francisco-based investment banking arm of FleetBoston Financial
Corp. In an industry dominated by old-line giants like Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., it is determined to make its mark. Or, at the very
least, to carve out its niche.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1978, not far from Silicon Valley and
at about the same time that the high-tech industry there began to
blossom (It was acquired by FleetBoston's predecessor, BankBoston
Corp., in 1998). Lately, its revenues have risen sharply, from $360
million in 1998 to $970 million last year to ``nearly a billion''
so far this year, according to Allen Olivo, its chief marketing
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Because Robertson Stephens has specialized for years in bringing
technology companies to market, with clients like the Etrade Group,
the online investment firm, it is, he said, ``the first investment
bank to focus on the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But how can that translate into an advantage over bigger, Wall
Street-based johnny-come-latelies? The idea is to build brand, said
Olivo, who has been involved in branding before with companies like
Amazon.com and Apple Computer, where he was senior director for
marketing communications during the ``Think Different'' days of the
late 1990s. Robertson Stephens was in Silicon Valley, literally and
figuratively, before anyone else, he said, and because of that has
``knowledge that gives us a unique perspective in a global growth
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence an unconventional new campaign devised by Portland,
Ore.-based Wieden and Kennedy that breaks Thursday, in this
newspaper and others. ``Thanks old economy,'' proclaim the
double-page spreads, words floating on an otherwise blank
background. ``We'll take it from here.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad is designed to ``say something, but quietly,'' said the
account director Trish Adams, and to stress the fact that Robertson
Stephens' ``culture is a little different from other investment
banks.'' Future print ads, also featuring one-line statements will
follow, she said, in publications like The Wall Street Journal,
Industry Standard and Fast Company. . And, like Thursday's example,
they will feature one-line statements _ ``headlines,'' Adams called
them _ that will be more like philosophical statements than
hard-sell slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson Stephens' 30-second television spots _ all of them
apparently filmed in double or triple time _ also aim to be
irreverent or even edgy in their message, she said, all without
delving too far into the substance of what, exactly, an investment
bank does.
</P>
<P>
   In one of them, for example, an off-camera, voice-over announcer
muses about America's westward migration and the fact that there is
``still so much more to be done.'' ``It's not time to settle
down,'' he intones as a freighter scoots by the Golden Gate Bridge,
waves lapping nearby and San Francisco's skyline barely visible in
the distance. ``It never is.''
</P>
<P>
   In another spot, the same voice asks if ``you really think that
all the technology in the world can erase economic truths that have
held for hundreds of years.'' And as clouds speed over the tops of
buildings in San Francisco's financial district, shot from a camera
looking up at times at nearly a 90-degree angle, he answers the
question himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``So do we,'' he says. ``Ladies and gentlemen, this time it's
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials will run primarily on Bloomberg television, CNBC
and CNNfn, Adams said, beginning this week and continuing through
at least year's end. And the lack of substance in them and in print
is deliberate, she said; for now, the idea is to say ``who they are
and what they stand for,'' with respect to Robertson Stephens.
Advertising with ``more content will be rotated in later, Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither she nor Olivo would disclose the size of the Robertson
Stephens effort, although the trade press put the figure at $25
million when Wieden and Kennedy was awarded the account back in
May. And while Olivo hopes that the campaign will result in
increased business for the firm, that will be only one of the
benchmarks by which its success will be gauged, he said. There are
other, more intangible measures as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our target is multi-faceted,'' he said, involving, among other
things, ``recruiting, as we grow in size and geographically,'' as
well as ``getting better known by the public'' and wielding
''greater influence in the general conversation about the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the next Goldman, Sachs or Morgan,
Stanley,'' Olivo said. ''We're just trying to become the most
influential investment bank in the new economy.'' &QL;

stealing venerable Republican campaign issues just as brazenly as
their GOP rivals are seizing Democratic campaign themes.

   In doing, both Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush
appear to be borrowing a favorite tactic from the master of the
campaign co-opt _ Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his freshly minted running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman
of Connecticut, used faith-based rhetoric on the campaign trail
again on Wednesday to grab for the heart of Bush's appealing
crusade for ``national renewal'' in the aftermath of Clinton-era
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was here that I learned to cherish faith, family and
community,'' Gore told supporters in his hometown of Carthage,
Tenn. ``It was here that I learned the importance of honor,
responsibility and doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, mindful that Americans rank family values and
restoration of national morals ahead of a balanced budget, defense
or abortion, emphasized that he and Gore ``share values'' as well
as a ``vision for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman last came to national attention with a Senate floor
speech in September 1998 condemning Clinton for behavior with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky that was ``not just
inappropriate; it is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore is fashioning a far wider appeal to all-important swing
voters in the Nov. 7 election by underlining support for a variety
of tried-and-true GOP proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plans include such Republican staples as paying off the
national debt, boosting the number of cops on the beat and adding a
constitutional amendment to ``make sure that victims and not just
criminals have guaranteed rights in our justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore even used his nationally televised announcement of his
selection of the first Jew to serve on a national ticket into a
reminder on Tuesday that he and Lieberman are so pro-defense that
they ``broke with our own party to cast two lonely Democratic
votes'' to support President Bush's request for congressional
authority to go to war to oust Iraqi occupation forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 of the Senate's 55 Democrats voted to use military power
to force Iraq out of Kuwait _ giving Bush a 52-47 vote of support
on the first de facto declaration of war since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also is taking a page from the populist crusade waged in
the presidential primaries by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who left
the race after a series of defeats by Bush. As Gore put it in a
television interview on Wednesday: He and Lieberman will mesh
because ``we both have the desire to fight for people and not the
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of McCain's campaign was limiting big-money
contributions to the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's bid appears to be paying off, enabling him to stage a
rebound in the polls. Bush's double-digit lead after the GOP
convention dwindled to 2 percentage points in a USA
Today/CNN/Gallup poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has been turning the tables on Gore just as
effectively, embracing issues in a bid to enlist the independent
voters and crossover Democrats who may hold the key to the outcome
in battleground states in the Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   Bush touts diversity, as he did at the GOP convention in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   He advertises plans to overhaul entitlement programs such as
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   He vows to augment Head Start for poor children to add a
literacy program _ an expansion of a program that his running mate,
Dick Cheney, sought to cut back as a congressman from Wyoming in
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the two-term governor of Texas, even echoes the
traditional Democratic rhetoric of giving disadvantaged Americas a
leg up on the ladder of upward mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are their country too,'' says Bush, insisting that the GOP
is ``not the party of response but the party of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The art of borrowing from political rivals is noting new. Many
trace the tactic to Dick Morris, the canny New York political
operative who helped Clinton craft a centrist, can-do message for
re-election in 1996 that enabled the president to become the first
elected Democrat since 1936 to win a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Morris successfully persuaded Clinton to retake the so-called
``values agenda'' by voicing support for proposals such as public
school uniforms, a moment of silent prayer in the classroom and
denunciation of gratuitous portrayals of violence on television, in
movies and in music.
</P>
<P>
   Morris once explained his approach as ``a process of taking the
best ideas from each party and combining them into a coherent
policy and program,'' adding in an interview with the New York
Times: ``It is not just splitting the difference but molding a
creative synthesis which rises above the doctrine of either
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heavy borrowing by the two sides, Gore on Bush
differ on abortion rights, Social Security overhaul, prescription
drug benefits for Medicare and environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign scholars say that candidates have raided rivals' ideas
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly didn't start with Dick Morris,'' said Larry
Sabato, a scholar at the University of Virginia and the author of
``Feeding Frenzy: Attack Journalism and American Politics.'' ``The
beliefs of political parties are only skin deep and after a few
losses, they'll very often put on the clothes of the other party in
an effort to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato recalls Clinton's success in 1992 co-opting GOP campaign
hallmarks including support for the death penalty, greater defense
spending and fiscal discipline to steer the Democratic Party out of
the political wilderness back and back into the White House for the
first time since the 1976 election.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Schick, a campaign scholar at the University of Maryland
who wrote ``American Government: Continuity and Change,'' said Gore
and Bush are trying to grab each other's agendas to offset
shortcomings in their own campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each party is trying to make up for a deficit _ Republicans
are short of new programs and the Democrats suffer a deficit on
values,'' Schick said.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that, Gore and Bush are competing for the same
middle-of-the-road swing voter who responds to pragmatic proposals
to solve problems rather than schemes that excite the party
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are smack in the center right now,'' Schick said.
``There's just not a market for big change so the candidates are
battling for the same ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Rockman, a presidential scholar at the University of
Pittsburgh who edited ``The Clinton Legacy,'' said Gore and Bush
are courting trouble from their party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political parties want these candidates to stick to the
party agenda,'' Rockman said. ``But the candidates have to create
some elbow room to make their way to the center. That creates
inevitable tension between the record and the rhetoric.''

SECURITY INTENSIFIED IN WAKE OF MOSCOW BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fear, grief and anger engulfed Moscow Wednesday as
police beefed up security in the aftermath of an explosion that
ripped through a pedestrian walkway in the heart of Russia's
capital, killing seven people and wounding at least 93.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir V. Putin tried to reassure his jittery
nation, calling ``hysteria and disorganization the best gift for
terrorists,'' and warning Russians not to rush to blame Chechens
for Tuesday's blast.
</P>
<P>
   Police meanwhile found a bag filled with explosives and
detonators at a Moscow train station, possibly preventing another
explosion, and sparking anxiety that Russia could be on the verge
of a new wave of terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Muscovites turned the site of Tuesday's blast, a walkway under
Moscow's popular Pushkin Square a short walk from the Kremlin, into
a makeshift shrine. Hundreds of people, many in tears, laid
flowers, candles and religious icons. Late Wednesday night, Putin
placed flowers on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are defenseless,'' said Vladimir Starostin, 70, standing
amid the rubble near the blast site. ``Explosion after explosion.
When will this all end?''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion evoked fearful memories of a series of apartment
bombings that killed over 300 people last September. Putin blamed
Chechen guerrillas for the blasts and sent troops to quell the
separatist republic.
</P>
<P>
   Several politicians, including Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, said
Chechen rebels, or their sympathizers, were also responsible for
Tuesday's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin, who gained popularity and rose to power largely due
to his tough response to last years explosions, warned against an
ethnic witchhunt aimed at Chechens. Putin said the blast could have
been either a terrorist act or part of a turf war among criminal
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that it is wrong to look for an ethnic connection,
a Chechen connection, to this or any other crime,'' Putin said in
televised comments. ``It is very wrong when we brand one nation,
because criminals, terrorists above all, do not have a nation or a
belief.''
</P>
<P>
   The president added, however, that Russia would continue its
11-month-old battle against Chechen separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebel leaders, including President Aslan Maskhadov,
denied any connection to the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said seven people had died in the
explosion, correcting earlier reports that said that eight people
had died.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wounded were two US citizens, Natalya Yelin and her
13-year-old son, Ilya, both of whom received burns and scratches
from the explosion. The US Embassy did not release their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Police fanned out across Moscow to check pedestrian underpasses,
subway stations, basements and attics for explosives. Vehicles
entering and leaving Moscow were searched extensively and police
vigilantly checked the passports of pedestrians on the street and
commuters riding public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the explosion said two men left a bag near a kiosk
before rushing away and driving off in a car just moments before
the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Earlyier, police detained two men, one from Chechnya and one
from neighboring Dagestan, and questioned them about the explosion.
Authorities later said the two were being held for possession of
narcotics but were not directly linked to the bombing. Adding to
the confusion, police released four sketches of suspects, but by
Wednesday night, Russian television was airing only one composite
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Police meanwhile found a suitcase containing nine pounds of TNT
and seven detonators in a lost luggage office at the Kazan Railway
Station in Moscow. Law enforcement officials said the explosives
were not wired for detonation, but police were investigating a
possible link to Tuesday's blast.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the smoldering rubble under Pushkin Square where the bomb
exploded, hundreds of Muscovites gathered to pay homage to the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Kochenko, 12, lost his grandmother in the explosion. He
kneeled and prayed in front of small shrine of flowers, candles and
icons.
</P>
<P>
   A group of young men, who bystanders said were friends and
relatives of some of the deceased, stood off to the side sobbing
and embracing each other. They quietly drank vodka and ate dark
bread, in remembrance of their friends.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters approached them, they became aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person I am asking you all to back off,'' one of the men
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Oksana Maurina, 23, who left the underground walkway minutes
before the blast, returned to the site to pay her respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible,'' she said. ``Why does fate allow one person
to live, while it takes the life of another. This is very
frightening,'' she said. ``I pass through here all the time and I
just can't believe what has happened.''

 &HT;    Being taken for a ride
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Before I made that dash from the air-conditioned
office to the air-conditioned car, I checked my finances. I had 65
cents to my name. I could buy a cold drink to sip on the way home,
or be 65 cents ahead tomorrow. I decided I needed the change more
than the soda.
</P>
<P>
   As I pulled out of the newspaper parking lot, cranked up the AC
and headed to the intersection, I saw her, looking like a
frightened rabbit. I figured her for somewhere in her 30s, although
a hard life had obviously taken its toll. Her dark hair framed a
face that had been too long exposed to the sun and her dark eyes
were pleading. If she wanted a handout, she was going to be out of
luck, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   As she rushed to my car window, I considered speeding away and
avoiding the whole mess, but cross traffic played to her advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Rats, I was caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, sir,'' she begged, ``it's so hot, can you please give
me a ride to the grocery store?'' I could tell she was close to
heat exhaustion. We were in the midst of a record-breaking
103-degree hot spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing out in this heat,'' I asked, trying to
figure out if she really needed a ride or if she was going to take
me for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had been downtown for an interview. Judging from
the condition of her clothes, and that she hadn't been close to
soap and water for awhile, I knew she likely wasn't going to be
hired anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, I told her to get in.
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioning was blowing cold and I was hot under the
collar. What kind of patsy am I, I thought as I stepped on the gas.
I don't know this person. She could have a gun for all I know. And
all I have is a lousy 65 cents.
</P>
<P>
   As I raced down the street on the fastest route to the grocery,
I noticed my passenger was concentrating on getting her face as
close to the air vent as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hot,'' she kept repeating. The best response I could
muster was an icy, ``Well, you had no business being out on the
hottest day of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   As we drove along, her breathing became more relaxed and she
began to hum along with the tune coming from the radio. I didn't
know what to say to her. ``Hot enough for you?'' just seemed to be
the wrong conversation starter. Taking a quick glance at her to
make sure she was recovering from the heat it became clearer why
she was in such dire straits. She had the unmistakable profile of a
woman with child.
</P>
<P>
   It was beginning to make sense now. She most likely had been
downtown to interview for financial assistance for her unborn
child. I pulled up to the entrance to the grocery store and as she
was getting out I said, ``Wait a minute.'' I dug in my pocket and
pulled out the quarter and four dimes. ``Here,'' I said. ``It's all
I've got. Go inside, cool off and buy yourself a cold drink.'' She
took the change without hesitation, thanked me for the ride and
disappeared into the store.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had had more than 65 cents to give her.

UPROAR OVER PROPOSED MOSQUE SHATTERS CALM OF A CHICAGO SUBURB 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALOS HEIGHTS, Ill. _ When a mosque offered to buy a church
building and move into this suburb southwest of Chicago a few
months ago, there were those who worried that it might not be
universally welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Even the pastor of the church that was up for sale, the Reformed
Church of Palos Heights, anticipated that some residents of this
overwhelmingly white and Christian community, some of whom fled the
diversity of Chicago, might be uncomfortable with a mosque in town.
</P>
<P>
   But no one predicted the uproar that followed _ or its tangled
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   At public meetings, residents spewed derogatory comments,
telling the Muslims to go back to their own countries, and implying
that their money could have come from a nefarious source. One
woman, in a television interview, said she believed Islam was a
``false religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Two City Council members made remarks that were insulting, or at
best ignorant. They also said the city should buy the building for
use as a recreation center, although they had not raised the idea
in the two years the church had been for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Then things got stickier.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council voted to pay the Al Salam Mosque Foundation
$200,000 to walk away from Palos Heights. To the surprise of some,
the mosque foundation accepted the offer. Then the mayor of Palos
Heights, Dean Koldenhoven, vetoed the buyout, saying he considered
it an insult to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a most unusual case, the city of Palos Heights is the
target of a federal civil rights lawsuit. The mosque foundation is
seeking $6.2 million, claiming the city's handling of the situation
amounted to religious discrimination, conspiracy and unwarranted
meddling in a private real estate transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mosque found it almost impossible to worship there,'' said
Rouhy Shalabi, a lawyer for the mosque foundation, which had been
looking for space to replace its rented building in Chicago.
``There was a cloud hanging over us in terms of not being welcomed
by the city. And then the buyout offer was made and vetoed. We were
really left with no choice,'' but to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Palos Heights, a suburb of middle-class homes and strip
shopping centers founded about 40 years ago, say the residents who
made the offensive comments were not representative of most of the
city's population. Some longtime Muslim residents said they felt
accepted, although some were not sure if their neighbors knew they
were Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old story of if the majority stays silent, the bad
voices spring forth,'' said the Rev. Edward Cronin of St.
Alexander's Catholic Church. ``The core of Palos Heights, these are
good people. They would have welcomed them.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has left its mark on Muslims in Palos Heights,
who make up about 450 of the city's 12,000 residents. Many were
stung and angered by the show of prejudice. But, while they would
have attended the proposed mosque, some criticize the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being put between a rock and a hard place,'' said Edward
Hassan, a developer who has lived here for more than 30 years and
who spoke up against the insensitive comments in public meetings.
``The buyout, to me, it was an insult. They should never have been
offered the money, and they never should have accepted it. I really
don't think that lawsuit should have been filed. It's harmful to
both sides.``
</P>
<P>
   Omar Najib, a lawyer from neighboring Palos Park who would have
attended the mosque, said he understood that the mosque foundation
felt ``fearful for their safety'' and ``did not want to make people
uncomfortable'' in Palos Heights.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking of the lawsuit, Najib, who heads a chapter of the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said, ``If you feel
it's getting to be too hot for you, walk away with honor and
dignity, but don't reduce yourself and diminish our religious faith
for a few dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began soon after the mosque foundation signed a $2.1
million contract in March to buy the Reformed Church and sought the
city's assurance that it could use the building as a religious
institution, just as the church had. At the City Council zoning
committee meeting on the matter, some residents and two council
members questioned the purpose and practices of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are proposing is like upside down,'' said Alderwoman
Julie Corsi, noting that the Muslim day of worship is on Friday.
``Yours is on Friday, and then you are not going to use it on
Sunday. It's kind of like comparing apples and oranges.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a newspaper interview, Alderman Jim Murphy, who wanted
the city to buy the church for use as a recreation center, said,
``If someone had intervened early on to stop Adolf Hitler, there
might not have been a world war.'' Murphy later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, Koldenhoven, condemned the insensitive comments. And
when Murphy, the mayor's political rival, proposed the buyout offer
in June, Koldenhoven called it insulting and ``fiscally
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be known as a city that says we don't want to
welcome these people,'' the mayor said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the money from the buyout offer would have allowed the
mosque foundation to cover its legal expenses and search for a more
accepting community, Shalabi said. Even if the mayor meant well by
vetoing the buyout in July, the mosque saw it as another example of
city interference in its private business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, everyone involved in the matter is bruised and
battered. A Justice Department official has offered to mediate the
lawsuit and proposed community meetings to foster dialogue between
Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole incident has raised some very significant issues in
people's lives that they have not had to struggle with,'' said the
Rev. Peter Semeyn of the Reformed Church. ``Unfortunately, when
some people think of Muslims they think of the people who bombed
the World Trade Center. They don't think of the people who live
across the street. The question is how do we all get along with
each other?''

`CAN'T YOU HEAR ME CALLIN': GOOD AND BAD IN THE CREATOR OF
BLUEGRASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Monroe was a mandolin virtuoso, an unforgettable singer, a
visionary bandleader, a brilliant judge of musicians and the
songwriter behind ``Blue Moon of Kentucky.'' He was also a
skinflint, a womanizer and man who could hold a grudge for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Richard D. Smith, a journalist and mandolinist who wrote
``Bluegrass: An Informal Guide,'' chronicles the great musician and
his messy life in ``Can't You Hear Me Callin','' and his reverence
for Monroe's music doesn't keep him from mentioning the
unflattering details.
</P>
<P>
   Smith makes bold claims for Monroe, calling him ``the most
broadly talented and broadly influential figure in American popular
music history.'' Partisans of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong,
Robert Johnson, Hank Williams, Bob Dylan, James Brown and others
might well disagree. But Monroe clearly belongs in the American
pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   He single-handedly turned rural string-band music, with a touch
of the blues, into bluegrass: music that brought together high,
lonesome harmony singing with an aggressive beat and breakneck
instrumental virtuosity. His repertory brought together Southern
ballads, gospel songs and dance tunes, professionalizing them and
revving them up to reach an audience that eventually spanned the
world. Monroe's bluegrass _ named after his band, the Blue Grass
Boys _ is a cornerstone of country music and, in turn, of rock.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Can't You Hear Me Callin','' Smith has gone through
small-town records, farm ledgers, interview transcripts, bootleg
recordings and legal documents; he has interviewed not only
Monroe's musicians but also his ex-girlfriends. It is a
meticulously researched and footnoted biography, intent on
straightening out chronologies and pinning down apocryphal stories.
It also looks into Monroe's music, connecting songs to the people
and landscapes that inspired them and explaining, without getting
too technical, Monroe's innovations and his evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, born in 1911, was the eighth and youngest child of a
farm family in Rosine, Ky. He was born cross-eyed, a defect that
was not surgically corrected until he was a teen-ager; other
children teased him, and he grew up shy. His father was
hard-working and distant, his mother nurtured him, and his brothers
were rowdy. Smith psychologizes, perhaps too neatly, that the
family set the pattern for Monroe's later personality: affectionate
with women, stoic and competitive with men.
</P>
<P>
   Bill's older brothers Charlie and Birch took up the family's
prized instruments, the guitar and fiddle, leaving Bill with the
lowly mandolin. It had been used mostly for backup. But Bill Monroe
turned it into a brilliant solo instrument with fierce runs, blues
bends and sharply syncopated rhythm chords.
</P>
<P>
   He worked with Charlie as a duo on the grueling country circuit
of daytime radio shows and nighttime concerts. In 1936 the Monroe
Brothers began recording for RCA Victor, tearing into the old
mountain songs in performances still cherished by country
aficionados. Two years later they went separate ways; Smith
determinedly debunks old rumors that Charlie made advances on
Bill's wife. On his own Bill Monroe began putting together the
music that would start its own tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe's new music crystallized in 1945, when the Blue Grass
Boys included a singing guitarist named Lester Flatt and took on a
new banjo player, Earl Scruggs. His three-finger picking style
originated in North Carolina, but he took it to a new plateau of
virtuosity, surrounding a melody with a shower of arpeggios. Monroe
had perfected a rhythm that seemed to jump ahead of the beat, and
with Monroe, Scruggs and a fiddler named Chubby Wise, songs became
contests among virtuoso soloists. Bluegrass was part of a postwar
renaissance of American music: brash, gutsy and built for speed.
</P>
<P>
   But it couldn't withstand the commercial onslaught of honky-tonk
country and of rock 'n' roll. Monroe's fortunes declined in the
1950s, only to be revived through an unlikely ally: the folklorist
Ralph Rinzler, who repositioned Monroe in the folk revival.
</P>
<P>
   Bluegrass, which had not long before been a vanguard music, was
greeted by Northern folk fans as a noble tradition. Monroe moved on
to the college and folk festival circuit; his bands began to
include Yankees, some of whom _ the guitarist Ry Cooder (who played
banjo in the Blue Grass Boys), the guitarist and singer Peter Rowan
and the fiddler Richard Greene _ would go on to find a place in
California rock and country-rock.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, there was a growing circuit of bluegrass festivals
where Monroe was venerated. He was a barnstormer, staying on the
road until a stroke felled him in March 1996; he died that
September.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Monroe left his wife and children for a series of
overlapping affairs; the women, Smith notes in passing, stayed in
touch with Monroe afterward, even those who sued him. Monroe made
misguided investments; he received songwriting credit on his
sidemen's work. He didn't speak to Flatt or Scruggs for more than
20 years after they left his band to become rivals. Smith patiently
sorts out the squabbles, usually taking Monroe's side or pointing
out that he came from an era when things were done differently.
Eventually, however, he grows exasperated with Monroe's obtuseness
in business matters.
</P>
<P>
   For all its information, Smith's biography is unable to
reanimate Monroe's character. And while he had access to the
extensive interviews Rinzler did for a book he never wrote, Smith
uses too little of Monroe's own terse, cantankerous voice. Monroe
remains a bundle of paradoxes: heartfelt and stone-faced, ruthless
and kindly. He was hardly the first great artist who turns out to
have been a user of the people around him.
</P>
<P>
   And Monroe's songs, with their constant tensions amid
poker-faced control, speed-fingered exuberance and abiding pain,
still dole out his story in three-minute revelations.

ROLE PLAYING WITHOUT SACRIFICING ACTION

<P>
   Diablo II, published by Blizzard Entertainment; $59.95; for
Windows 95, 98, 2000, NT with Service Pack 5 and MacOS 8.1 or
later; for mature audiences. Soulbringer, published by Interplay;
$44.81; for Windows 95/98; for teen-agers. Icewind Dale, published
by Interplay; $44; for Windows 95/98; for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the past is worth repeating. The original Diablo,
released late in 1996, had its roots in the classics. Blizzard
Entertainment's designers conceived it as a more lavish version of
graphically spartan role-playing games like Hack and Rogue from the
early days of computer gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Role-playing games are usually quick to assign onerous
housekeeping tasks and slow to offer rewards. Diablo reversed that
equation. The housekeeping was comparatively minor. The interface
was so simple that the housekeeping was even fun. The rewards were
everywhere. And while it sparked debate about whether it was a
role-playing game or an action game, Diablo nevertheless captured a
huge audience and stirred rival publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Diablo II paints Diablo's concept onto a much larger canvas _ if
Diablo was the dungeon-oriented Hack, Diablo II is the more worldly
Omega. It has that same classical balance and proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Sensibly, Blizzard has not made repairs where repairs were not
needed. Once again, you are looking down on your character from an
angle. Once again, the controls are simple: one mouse button for
weapon swings, the other for casting spells. Once again, the game
world is visually striking, and the action remains fast and
furious.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, the game smoothly blends action and
role-playing. You simply pick one of five characters and from
there, it's straight to the starting camp. That's where you learn
the rudiments of the story and are dispatched to prove your mettle.
</P>
<P>
   But everything here seems larger than in the original Diablo.
When you cross the rain-dappled river that leads into the
wilderness, the sheer size of the bridge and the camp's log walls
suggest that you are embarking on a quest that is larger than life.
And that game world extends far beyond the original game's single
deep dungeon.
</P>
<P>
   Actual size is important, but so is the impression of size.
Diablo II stretches out toward a horizon that seems to advance
before you like the curve of the earth. And it is a perilous
landscape: monsters that spot you will move toward you as if drawn
by a magnet.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, you can save your progress only at your base, which
will never seem quite close enough, and death waits patiently for
the adventurer who pauses too long.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an inconvenience rather than a tragedy: you reappear in
camp beside your corpse with your status and most of your booty
intact. Teleportation pads can take you back to the scene of a
fatal mistake. You carry some of the burdens typically associated
with role-playing games, but they are manageable burdens. That's
part of the art and the beauty of being Diablo II.
</P>
<P>
   Diablo is so influential that it has come to define a subgenre:
RPG Lite. Interplay's recent game, Soulbringer, developed by
Gremlin Interactive, fits squarely in that category. It is
accessible, it is darkly pretty and it is fun. As your character
approaches an inhospitable river town on a snowy night, the game
acquires a rich cloak of atmosphere, a quality that the often
frenetic Diablo II often seems to lack.
</P>
<P>
   Once you perform some basic quests, like clearing out the
brigands who occupy the marketplace, the town will open its doors
and gates to admit you to the surrounding countryside. In the
process, Soulbringer offers some compelling adventures and plays
some very nasty tricks. Soulbringer has some of the meticulousness
of a full-blown role-playing game, but it also has the immediacy of
a Diablo, and it's a nice mix.
</P>
<P>
   Icewind Dale, also from Interplay, is the flip side of this
coin. It's a big, brawny role-playing game in the spirit and shape
of Baldur's Gate, which used a version of the same game engine. You
create up to six characters in detail, right down to their
biographies and traditional antipathies, and shepherd them through
the frozen wastes of the Forgotten Realms using Advanced Dungeons
and Dragons rules.
</P>
<P>
   But if Diablo II feels like moving back in with your parents,
Icewind is like breaking in new roommates. You've got to get to
know those roommates before you can like them, and that requires an
investment of time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   You make sure that everyone is fitted out in the best kit
possible for your budget. And then one day a goblin gets in a lucky
hit, a character dies and you feel a twinge of regret that goes
beyond the simple inconvenience of finding a temple to resurrect
him. You can't help missing your characters when they are killed.
You have grown used to them, and after all, they are what you have
made them.

<P>
   MERJ 'UYUN, Lebanon _ Lebanese government forces rolled into
southern Lebanon before dawn Wednesday for the first time in 22
years.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited deployment came two months and two weeks after
Israel withdrew from its costly occupation, but military and
government officials immediately made clear that they had no
intention of deploying Lebanese troops along the border with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the mixed force of 500 soldiers and 500 special police
will act as an internal security force, keeping order among a
population divided between Christians and Shiite Muslims and
preventing old scores from being settled between the Shiite
Hezbollah guerrillas and people who fought for Israel's proxy
militia.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the point, the task force is commanded not by the
army, but by Col. Nazih Abu Nader of the Internal Security Forces,
who reports directly to the interior minister, Michel Murr.
</P>
<P>
   Murr and other Lebanese officials have said repeatedly that the
border is the responsibility of U.N. peacekeepers and that Lebanon
does not want to serve as Israel's border guard.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the government is said to be worried that the close
proximity of the border posts, sometimes only a few yards apart,
might lead to incidents or that Lebanon might be held responsible
if Palestinian or Islamic guerrillas struck into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a defensive force,'' Gen. Elias Farhat, the army
spokesman, said. ``The task is maintaining law and order.''
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of the Lebanese contingent was dependent on the
U.N. peacekeepers taking up border positions last weekend and has
been the subject of weeks of haggling between Lebanon, the United
Nations and Israel, beginning with exactly where the border was.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a telephone call from Damascus, which calls the
shots in Lebanon, President Emile Lahoud gave the go-ahead on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the de facto force on the ground for more than two
months, has pledged not to interfere with the government
authorities. Its forces, with a core of about 500 fighters have
reverted to civilian clothes and are not carrying weapons in
public, although they are planning to keep them hidden away.
</P>
<P>
   But a drive along some of the remote back roads near the border
found Hezbollah fighters in casual clothes with binoculars and
walkie-talkies still manning checkpoints and observation posts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, at Border Post 14, near the village of Rumaysh, where a
U.N. detail from Nepal was originally posted, the only force
visible on the Lebanese side consisted of five young Hezbollah
guerrillas lounging in an old guard post.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, a tall, bearded young man in a baseball hat and
track suit, showed the way up a road to what had been a major
crossing point into Israel, now a tangled wreck of corrugated metal
and old beams. Just ahead of where the pale blue U.N. flag still
flew near an abandoned pile of sandbags, an Israeli backhoe was
busily digging for a new border fence.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Hezbollah men and U.N. officials said the Nepalese had
left at the request of the Lebanese government, which did not want
U.N. forces at the old crossing points. There was no further
explanation of the reasoning behind the order.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment, when it finally came, was made up of mostly
gray-clad Internal Security police and military police, who spent
the day in their new barracks.
</P>
<P>
   The main body is to be based at an old army barracks here in
Merj 'Uyun, a mostly Christian town, that had been the headquarters
of the South Lebanese Army, Israel's proxy militia. About a third
were sent to Bint Jubayl, a predominantly Shiite town farther
south, where one main street is marked by a sculpture of a hand
grenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main impact of the deployment is psychological,'' said a
senior U.N. official. ``It's a really badly needed reassurance for
these people who have been alone too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Qulayah, the Christian village next to Merj 'Uyun was almost
deserted Wednesday. It had furnished many of the officers and
troops for the SLA and, consequently, many of the 6,000 refugees
who scrambled across the border when Israel abruptly pulled out on
May 24.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, Hezbollah has acted in a remarkably restrained and
disciplined manner, and there has been little in the way of
reprisals. The Christian areas, in particular, where bloodletting
could have revived the passions of the 15-year civil war, have been
left alone.
</P>
<P>
   In the main square of Merj 'Uyun, framed by picturesque stone
buildings and the distinctive cross atop a Greek Orthodox Church,
people waited for the army, barracked just down the road to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are they deployed? We haven't seen anything yet,'' said
George Mandalek, 67, who immediately mentioned his children in
Detroit and Oklahoma City. ``Well, I welcome the army anyway. We
went through a lot of troubled times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected it to be like this,'' he said of the quiet
that has prevailed here since late May. ``That's why those who went
left. They were afraid. The liberation was very calm. To be honest,
nobody expected it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adid Maalouf, 80 and a fit-looking retired soldier, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a more genteel atmosphere,'' he said.
``We went through times when everything was turned upside down. But
now everything is calm.
</P>
<P>
   But Jean Mandalek, George's twin brother, took a dimmer view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody goes back to the root of the problem,'' he said. ``The
Palestinians came here, they massacred and burned. Then the
Israelis came and did the same. Since May, what has the government
done?
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here, how can they live, what will they do?'' he
asked. ``Nothing has happened.''

 &HT;    LA officials to roll out the red carpet today for Democratic
National Convention
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - Mayor Richard Riordan and Democratic Party
officials will literally roll out the red carpet today at Staples
Center for the 35,000 delegates, guests and media who will attend
the Democratic National Convention at the gleaming new complex.
</P>
<P>
   Unfurling the rug is ``the symbolic welcoming of the world to
Los Angeles,'' said Ben Austin, spokesman for the Los Angeles host
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for the convention, the first here since President
Kennedy was nominated in 1960, are high in a city that has
experienced more than its share of problems recently. But the
anxiety level is also rising.
</P>
<P>
   Police are bracing for between 25,000 and 50,000 demonstrators -
far more than were present at the Republican convention in
Philadelphia - to stage marches, block traffic and engage in civil
disobedience. Much of the action will take place across the street
from the convention center's main entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department canceled all days off for the
9,300-member force during the convention, which begins Monday and
ends Aug. 17. Officers are expected to work 12-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, California
Highway Patrol and Secret Service are also sending personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the police and protest leaders are high and
some fear there is a potential for violent conflicts, similar to
those that caused $2.5 million in damage in Seattle during the
World Trade Organization meeting last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be enormous scrutiny,'' says City Councilman
Michael Feuer. ``The pressure is on. But I am optimistic that we
are going to rise to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the protesters say there has been too much
scrutiny. They demanded Tuesday that the LAPD halt its surveillance
of the protesters' headquarters and said that, unless authorities
agree, they will go to court today to seek an injunction against
the department.
</P>
<P>
   Activists fear the LAPD will emulate police in Philadelphia and
Washington, D.C., who shut down buildings where protesters were
storing banners and puppets they planned to use during
demonstrations in those cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are here are very alarmed at the surveillance
and the threat they will be raided by the LAPD,'' said Dan Tokaji,
an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California. ``They are very concerned the LAPD will be taking
action to suppress their right to free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   City officials pursued the Democratic Party for the right to
host the convention as way to stage a coming out party for Los
Angeles after a decade of setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   First, there were the riots after the Rodney King verdict in
1992, then there were devastating 1994 earthquakes that caused $20
billion in damage. Also, the recession of the early 1990s lingered
longer in California, and Los Angeles was one of the last major
cities to recover.
</P>
<P>
   City officials believed it was time to rewrite the negative
stereotypes when in April 1999 they won the right to host the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the city's opportunity to showcase Los Angeles to the
world,'' says Councilman Alex Padilla, who chaired the council's ad
hoc convention committee.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla himself puts a face on the diverse, ethnically vibrant
city Los Angeles has become. The son of Mexican immigrants who
attended only four years of school, the 27-year-old Democrat
graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a
degree in engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is now the most ethnically diverse city in the
country, home to the largest concentration of Mexicans outside of
Mexico, the largest population of Koreans outside the Korean
peninsula and citizens from 140 other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The city is in the midst of a mini-high technology boom, with a
high-tech workforce of more than 200,000. In 1999 $1.2 billion in
venture capital flowed to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million Staples complex, home of the Los Angeles
Lakers, is one of several major new developments downtown. A new
2,300 seat concert hall, designed by Frank Gehry, is being built
for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The city also recently completed
a new, though costly metro-rail system to help ease the city's
notorious traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the city's air quality, long the butt of many jokes, is
something to brag about. Air pollution has been cut by two-thirds
since the 1960 convention, when media were given eye drops along
with their credentials to ease the polluted air's burning side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have hosted this convention eight years ago, even
four years ago,'' says Austin, of the host committee. ``The mere
fact that we were able to have this convention reflects how far we
have come in such a short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   EDITORS: Optional add follows.
</P>
<P>
   But the convention was awarded prior to televised images of
rioting in the streets of Seattle, where demonstrators brought the
WTO trade meeting to a virtual standstill and showed how such
high-profile gatherings could also become a public relations
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The level of trust between the police and the demonstration
leaders is low, according to several officials who have been
attempting to mediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a climate of fear and dire predictions of
hundreds of anarchists burning our city down,'' says James
Lafferty, director of the city's National Lawyers Guild, blaming
police for escalating the tensions. ``There are good people here in
this city who are trying to calm folks down, but I would be less
than honest if I didn't say I was nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say that they expect the majority of demonstrators to be
law-abiding, but believe a small minority will attempt illegal
disruptions. Of special concern is the North American Anarchist
Conference that happens to be scheduled in Los Angeles during the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Police have purchased paint-ball guns to tag law breakers and
have signaled they will use rubber bullets and other ``impact
munitions'' to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is those groups that have clearly indicated that
they are coming to Los Angeles to shut the city down,'' says Lt.
Horace Frank, the department's spokesman. ``We're not going to let
that happen. We owe it to the people of this city to do everything
we legitimately can to stop it from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the protest leaders say they also don't want
violence. But they plan a variety of marches and street actions,
including civil disobedience that will likely result in arrest, to
communicate their political message of social justice and corporate
greed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The civil disobedience part of this is very important,'' says
Margaret Prescod, a spokeswoman for the coalition of groups
planning a weekong series of marches. ``But we are not violent
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the demonstrators are young and they hope to convey
their messages in colorful street theater and music. At the
protesters' command center a few blocks from downtown, volunteers
have been building giant puppets featuring menacing versions of the
heads of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore and
the Republican nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Erlenbusch, an advocate for the homeless, says he wants to
call attention to the 50,000 to 80,000 people who he estimates are
homeless in Los Angeles on any given night.
</P>
<P>
   Many are veterans of the protests in Seattle and Washington,
D.C., where demonstrators disrupted a World Bank conference earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most of us are interested in is showing the country and
the world the real Los Angeles, a city where 50 people control as
much wealth as two million, a city where at least one-third of the
children grow up in poverty,'' says Garrick Ruiz, 23. ``Those
people don't have the money to contribute to the Democratic
Party.''

 &HT;    TEXANS WITH CONCEALED GUN LICENSES MORE PRONE TO GUN ARRESTS
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texans with licenses to carry a concealed handgun
have been arrested for weapons-related crimes at a rate nearly
double that of the state's overall adult population, the Violence
Policy Center reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the gun-control advocacy group's report was described as
distorted and politically motivated by Texas state Rep. Suzanna
Gratia Hupp and the office of Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 to 1999, the Washington-based center reported, there
were 873 arrests of licensed gun holders in Texas for
weapon-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 183 of the arrests were for assault and
aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and 108 for deadly conduct
and discharge of a firearm. It said 486 were for unlawfully
carrying a weapon, and the rest for a variety of charges ranging
from discharge of a firearm to disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The study relied on statistics compiled by the Texas Department
of Public Safety from January 1996 to last April.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Brock, the center's policy analyst, said that 4 out of
1,000 licensed gun holders were arrested on gun-related charges
over the period of the study, compared to about 2.4 out of 1,000
persons in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans were promised that only law-abiding citizens would be
allowed to carry concealed guns, but the arrests of these license
holders show that instead of stopping crimes, they are committing
them,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association ``promised all of us that
concealed handgun owners were the cream of the crop of gun owners,
so we decided to take a look at how this law actually operated,''
said Josh Sugarmann, the center's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The center reported that over all, there were 3,370 arrests of
licensees in the four-year period, but not all of them were
weapon-related. The study did not say how many of the arrests
resulted in convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose (of the Texas Concealed Handgun Law) is to promote
and sell handguns. This law is not about public safety,'' said Nina
Butts, a lobbyist for Texans against Gun Violence, a group that
promotes stricter gun regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on the study, the National Rifle Association
provided the name of Hupp, a Republican state representative.
</P>
<P>
   Hupp said many of the arrests were due to careless licensed gun
holders bringing the weapons into places where they were not
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Licensed gun holders ``are more likely to have a weapons-related
offense, but that has nothing to do with violent crimes,'' said
Hupp. ``I'm not worried about running into (concealed handgun
license holders). I am worried about running into rapists and
murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed the concealed handgun law in May 1995, during his
first term as governor. To obtain a license, applicants must pay a
$140 application fee and undergo 10 hours of firearms proficiency
training. They cannot have a criminal record, and lose their
license if convicted of a serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, a spokesperson for Bush, said the center's research
is misleading and implied that it was intended to harm the
governor's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 31 states with concealed handgun laws, yet
the study only chooses to look at Texas,'' said Jones. ``What
people really care about is violent crimes, and other studies show
adult males without concealed carry permits are eight times more
likely to commit a violent crime than permit holders.''

GETTING THE ORIGIN OF `FRICK AND FRACK' DOWN COLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the expression ``Frick and Frack''? _
A.D.E., Everman, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Frick and Frack were the show business names of a comedic ice
skating duo who performed for the Ice Follies.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss skaters Werner Groebli (Frick) and Hans Mauche (Frack)
joined Ice Follies in the '30s, wearing Alpine costumes with
lederhosen and performing tricks such as the ``cantilever
spread-eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   Attesting to their popularity, ``Frick and Frack'' has become a
reference for similar people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phrase has become a fairly common one in North America for
any two people who are closely connected in some way,'' writes
Michael B. Quinion of the Web site World Wide Words at
www.quinion.com/words.
</P>
<P>
   Groebli, 85, lives in Palm Springs, Calif., and was featured on
a 1999 PBS special.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Chatty Cathy doll from the '60s that still talks.
How can I find someone who might be interested in buying it? _
M.G., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact the Chatty Cathy Collectors Club, an 11-year-old
group that mails out a quarterly newsletter. Write to Box 4426,
Seminole, FL 33775-1426, or visit the Web site
www.ttinet.com/chattycathy.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel originally produced Chatty Cathy in 1959 with sayings by
June Foray, the voice of Rocky the Squirrel, Tweety's owner Granny
and other cartoon characters. A 1970 version was produced using the
voice of Maureen McCormick from ``Brady Bunch''.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mattel began producing some of the original Chatty
Cathy dolls again in collector's editions. They say 11 phrases,
including ``I'm hungry'' and ``I hurt myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I write to Charley Taylor, former wide receiver for
the Washington Redskins? _ B.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Taylor and other past or present players in care of
Washington Redskins, 21300 Redskin Park Drive, Ashburn, VA 20147.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a first-round draft pick as a running back in 1964,
retired as the league's all-time leader in pass receptions with
649. He also had 9,410 yards receiving, 90 touchdowns and was a
1984 inductee into the NFL Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   After attending Dalworth High School in Grand Prairie, Taylor
was an All-American running back for Arizona State University.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The power of ones and zeroes is invading the centuries-old field
of architecture, helping today's designers and artisans create
structures that would otherwise be much more difficult _ or even
impossible _ to build.
</P>
<P>
   The results can be seen in such showcased structures as the
recently opened Experience Music Project in Seattle and the
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, both by Frank Gehry. It is also
apparent in the ambitious design, completed last fall, of the New
York Presbyterian Church in Queens, N.Y., an alteration of an older
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have computers,'' said Greg Lynn, one of the
architects of the church project, ``the interior of this building
would have been much simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether computers take a leading role at the start
of a project or later in the process, digital technologies are
transforming the way buildings are designed and constructed.
Computers can speed things up, allowing architects to compete in a
world where everything needs to have been done yesterday. They also
make it possible for architects to sell their designs to clients in
new ways.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Presbyterian Church, in the Sunnyside neighborhood,
features a large, open sanctuary that seats 2,500 and has a ceiling
composed of warped surfaces, computer-designed ribbed forms that
look different from different angles. On the building's exterior, a
staircase is partly enclosed in a tunnel-like structure that
shields arriving churchgoers from a view of the gritty industrial
neighborhood yet gives them a view of the Manhattan skyline as they
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn, an architect in Venice, Calif., who is also a professor at
Zurich University's architectural school, and his colleagues _ Doug
Garafalo in Chicago and Michael McInturf in Cincinnati _ are in the
forefront of a group of architects who are creating complex shapes
that emphasize continuity, rather than borders, between walls and
ceilings. It is a style made feasible by the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before computers, you'd start designing using shapes of
cubes,'' Lynn said. ``Now I can start with something like a
handkerchief, an object that doesn't have strong inside and outside
boundaries or much closed volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn and other proponents of this type of architectural design
are able to do that because they are using software that looks at
shapes not as the product of a collection of straight lines that
are each specified by fixed two-dimensional coordinates, but rather
as the product of three-dimensional curves that can be defined by
mathematical formulas. In this way, even a straight line can be
defined as a curve _ just one that has not yet been inflected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a computer, every point on a structure has to be
calculated with reference to everything else,'' Lynn said. ``But by
using a PC, I can create complex curves that don't have radii or
centers. Since the entire form is tied into itself through a
complex mathematical equation, I can easily push and pull the shape
and have the equation automatically recalculate the new
relationships within that form. If I tried to do that by hand, a
day's work would take a couple of years _ literally.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn has thrown away the architect's tools of wooden models and
hand-drawn diagrams in exchange for a practice based solely on
software. Using 3-D animation programs like Maya, Lynn creates
structures that can be rotated on the screen in three dimensions
and covered with textures and shadows.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens church is a $10 million structure that was built atop
an Art Moderne building, the old Knickerbocker Laundry Factory,
which had 88,000 square feet. When working on the church, Lynn sent
his files via modem to his two partners. Some of those same files
were also sent to materials fabricators who used
computer-controlled machinery to cut needed materials automatically
with high degrees of precision.
</P>
<P>
   While Lynn works to create forms that would not be practical
without computers, others, like Gehry, continue to create in real,
rather than virtual, space. Gehry, based in Santa Monica, Calif.,
does not use computers to create a design, but he uses them to
communicate the design's essentials to those who will ultimately
execute the plan. Without computers, carrying out Gehry's designs
would be extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry's most-celebrated recent structures also include the Walt
Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, as well as the museums in
Seattle and Bilbao. All those projects began with wooden models,
which were translated into three-dimensional digitized computer
files only after the architects were satisfied with the designs.
Those digital files then served as a nexus for parts suppliers,
fabricators and contractors around the world, all of whom had
access to one central, tightly controlled online source of
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   One strong advocate of digital design is Terry Beaubois, an
architect who is also director of the Palo Alto, Calif., chapter of
the American Institute of Architects. ``My goal is to be able to
retrieve, view, store, modify and send my architectural files to
collaborators, clients and manufacturers,'' Beaubois said, ``so
that we can all view things in three dimensions on the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The need to draw designs on paper has slowed architects down.
Not only do building designs generate reams of paper plans, with
multiple copies of blueprints for every participant in the project,
but every product used in a building must be drawn fresh each time.
In a study conducted by Beaubois, he learned that in some cases, an
item as simple as a toilet would be drawn multiple times: by the
manufacturer, for its brochure; by the architects, for their
design; by the subcontractor, for more detailed shop drawings; and
by the facilities manager, to create the post-construction ``as
built'' drawings. And all those drawings are two-dimensional,
making it hard to visualize them accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Computers can minimize such delays. Using computer modeling, and
using the computer to forward files electronically to his client,
Beaubois recently completed plans for a 10,000-square-foot house,
including a guest house and stable, in just five days, instead of
the weeks or months such a project would usually take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this technology, you could go to lunch while waiting
for an element in a design to be redrawn,'' Beaubois said. ``Now,
with tools such as Photoshop, I can create and recreate something
in an instantaneous flow. If a client doesn't like something, I can
change it immediately, and no misunderstanding or mistrust is
created. It's like Wolfgang Puck cooking your meal to order in
front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The renderings produced with a computer can be much easier for
clients to understand. Architects like Mark Miller, co-owner of
Miller, Kelley Architects of San Francisco, are creating highly
detailed, animated ``fly-overs'' of their computer-generated
structures.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate Miller's concept for a new General Motors design
center in Warren, Mich., the firm created a five-minute animated
film. Viewers feel as though they are sitting in a helicopter as a
daredevil pilot swings up, around and even through the building,
walls and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our animations are so literal,'' Miller said, ``our clients
think they're almost watching a photograph. And they want their
building to look exactly like the animation.''
</P>
<P>
   This sophisticated short film took 20 linked computers one week
to create. Software that would allow a viewer to choose a path to
travel around a highly detailed neighborhood in real time does not
yet exist.
</P>
<P>
   Some architects look forward to faster computers that will let
them create life-size three-dimensional models that can be
projected on a wall and be viewed from any angle. Even when such a
trick becomes possible, there will be some limitations: No matter
how much one twists and turns a three-dimensional computer model of
a structure, in some ways it is still a two-dimensional experience.
The image is displayed on a flat surface like a computer screen.
The viewer cannot really walk around it, peer into its windows or
run in and out of it to understand the relationship of the building
to its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   While computers may speed up the design process, they, like any
medium, including the human hand, impose their own artistic
limitations. Depending on the software used, buildings can take on
a particular look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I see a finished building and say, `Oh, yeah, that
was made using Form Z,''' said Charles Stilworth, an architect in
Studios Architecture. ``If you develop a project using AutoCAD,
which favors extrusions, it'll come out different than if you used
Maya, which can replicate wave actions. If you're smart, you'll
pick a program based on what's in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gehry prefers to develop his concepts on paper, creating more
and sophisticated physical models as his ideas take shape. Once the
design is set, the physical model is digitized by plotting various
coordinates, using a tool developed for neurosurgeons. The
resulting points are then manipulated on the computer in Catia, a
modeling program originally created for the French aerospace
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The original design for the Disney Concert Hall called for stone
cladding across the exterior. The firm used the computer to
streamline the design, reducing the variation in the stone shapes
and thereby cutting fabrication costs. The plan was to manufacture
the cladding through an automated process to cut costs and to have
computer data sent electronically from Gehry's office to the plant
to control the machinery that would cut the material. The cladding
was eventually changed from stone to metal to meet seismic
requirements. But Jim Glymph, a partner in Gehry's firm, said the
time was near when these kinds of novel designs ``will cost no more
than mass-produced products.''
</P>
<P>
   Glymph is entranced by computers not because they can create
designs, but because they can help bring efficiency to the
now-chaotic control process inherent in construction. The
construction industry, however, is still far from the time when
laborers will walk around every building site with laptops,
checking the latest updates to the buildings' designs.
</P>
<P>
   A typical construction project can generate up to 10,000
documents. ``The paper process is imbedded in this industry,''
Glymph said. ``The generation of permits, legal processes and plans
is all done on paper. In construction, there's always a change that
will wind up generating thousands of documents. On the Disney
Concert Hall, switching from stone to metal cladding alone meant
that we had to make 5,000 new drawings.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a decade, Glymph and others say, the design and
fabrication process will become much more centralized, and the
Internet will become a hub for the business. All documents will be
posted in a central location. Contractors and fabricators will
receive different levels of access to plans _ some will be able to
modify them while others will only be able to read them.
</P>
<P>
   Materials fabricators anywhere will be able to download
specifications and create samples to compete for a construction
contract. As a result, the Internet has the potential to let more
people compete in the construction industry. Previously unknown
artisans, even those working in remote villages, will be able to
vie for contracts if they have Internet access, and that will give
architects more choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, we'll be able to create computerized plans that,
when you click on a certain part of it, will show all of an
object's attributes,'' said Beaubois, of the American Institute of
Architects. ``That way, a contractor will be able to get
information without having to call the architect. High-speed
Internet access will allow this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, referring to the architectural flowering during the
Renaissance, ``Thanks to computers, this is the most exciting time
in architectural history since 1492.''

DESPITE FOREIGN DISAPPROVAL, JAPAN EXPANDS HUNT FOR A NATIONAL
DELICACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ To understand why Japan expanded its whale hunting
activities last month, despite international opposition, come to
dinner at Taruichi, a festive whale-meat restaurant in Tokyo's
trendy Shinjuku district.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, not a seat or sake glass was empty in
Taruichi as dozens of jovial patrons, ranging from business
executives to domestic workers, feasted on the house specialties.
There were 36 choices in all, including fried whale, raw whale,
whale bacon, whale heart, whale testicle, whale kidney, and even
ice cream made from the whale's fat.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign governments and environmental groups opposed to
Japan's stepped-up whaling efforts might have found the cuisine a
bit, well, hard to swallow. But it was an evening of culinary bliss
for Japanese diners, many of whom grew up eating whale and consider
it part of their national culture and identity that they strongly
defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war, there was nothing to eat in Japan, and we would
have starved if it were not for the whale bacon and steaks that the
government provided us in school lunches,'' said Hiromi Kanomuri, a
47-year-old copywriter, who munched on pieces of whale skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may eat the whale, but we also revere it,'' Kanomuri said.
``How can a total stranger tell us not to hunt whales without
knowing how much this meat means to us? Such arrogance annoys me.''
</P>
<P>
   The stranger to which Kanomuri so pointedly referred was the
United States, which has threatened to impose sanctions on Japan
for extending its whale hunts to include sperm and Bryde's whales,
which are both protected by U.S. endangered species laws. The
Japanese already hunt minke whales, which are abundant enough to
allow limited harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Six Japanese whaling ships are currently heading for the
northwestern Pacific with the goal of hunting 160 minke as well as
50 Bryde's and 10 sperm whales, all in the name of science. It will
be the first time since 1987 that Japan has hunted Bryde's and
sperm whales.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting in Tokyo last week with Foreign Minister Yohei
Kono, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that the United
States was deeply troubled by Japan's decision to expand its hunt,
which she said was ``contrary to whaling agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the United States would not hesitate to retaliate.
Under the Pelly Amendment to a 1967 fisheries law, the United
States can embargo imports from any nation that violates a marine
conservation treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Britain also denounced Japan's whale hunt, as did several
conservation groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and
Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese maintain that no one has the right to tell them
what they should not eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are a bunch of culinary imperialists,'' said Takashi
Sato, Taruichi's owner. ``Telling the Japanese not to hunt whales
is like telling the British to stop having their afternoon tea or
denying French people their pate. This is how you start a war.''
</P>
<P>
   A jolly man of ample girth, Sato is fond of pounding his broad
chest and proclaiming that he is made of ``100 percent whale
meat,'' which he said he has eaten every day since he was old
enough to chew.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have been hunting whales for more than 1,000 years,
and there are dozens of shrines, regional festivals and religious
ceremonies centered on the whale.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the popularity of whale meat, which was a vital
source of protein after World War II, has declined substantially in
Japan in the years following the international moratorium on
commercial whale hunts in 1986. But for many elderly and
middle-aged Japanese, the whale is embedded in their taste buds, if
not their psyches, and they are willing to pay a premium to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Whale bacon costs about $150 a pound in Japanese department
stores compared with $100 a pound for top-quality beef. Many
Japanese are willing to shell out $50 to $80 a person to dine on
whale meat delicacies. A sliver of whale bacon about the size of a
business card costs $5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating whale is as symbolic and important to the Japanese as
saving the whale is to us,'' said an American biologist who opposes
Japanese whaling but acknowledges cultural differences in the way
the two countries view the sea mammal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only hope is that younger generations of Japanese will see
things differently,'' said the biologist, who is a member of the
International Whaling Commission and spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Fisheries Ministry officials dispute U.S. charges that
Japan is violating international whaling treaties. The officials
maintain that their whale hunts are permitted by the International
Whaling Commission, which, when it banned commercial whaling,
allowed whales to be killed for scientific purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan caught about 400 minke whales under the scientific
research exemption last year. After the scientific data was
collected, the whale meat was sold to fish markets and restaurants
like Taruichi. Oil and other byproducts from the whales was used to
make cosmetics and perfumes. The proceeds are used to help finance
the research.

oversee the whaling expeditions. While the institute makes about
$35 million a year from the sale of whale meat from its scientific
catches, it costs about $40 million a year to conduct the research.
The institute receives a government subsidy of $5 million a year to
offset its shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Minoru Morimoto, Japan's whaling commissioner, said that Japan
has resumed hunting sperm and Bryde's whale because research data
suggest that their populations have sufficiently recovered to allow
the scientific catches. The new research is being conducted to
gather information on habitat, diet and migration patterns of the
whales, Morimoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is particularly interested in understanding the eating
habits of larger whales like the sperm and Bryde's, which many
Japanese scientists, Morimoto said, believe are diminishing Japan's
seafood supply.
</P>
<P>
   While conservationists concede that Japan's scientific
expeditions can be justified under whaling commission rules, they
maintain that Japan is using research whaling as a cover for
commercial whaling because the meat ends up in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Japan's scientific whale hunt also say that there are
ways to conduct the same research without killing so many whales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all one big facade,'' said Sanae Sida, a spokeswoman for
the Greenpeace environmental group in Tokyo. ``With today's high
technology and advances in science, the Japanese government expects
us to believe that the only way to obtain this research is by
killing the animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent scientists who are members of the
International Whaling Commission's science committee said in
interviews that they believed Japan could conduct its whaling
research using nonlethal techniques like biopsy darts. The
projectiles are used to retrieve a small amount of whale tissue,
which is used for DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA samples can tell us virtually everything we need to know
about whale populations,'' said Michael F. Donoghue, a biologist
for New Zealand's Conservation Department. ``You simply don't have
to kill these animals anymore for science.''
</P>
<P>
   But Seiji Oshumi, director of the Cetacean Research Institute,
said his researchers perform more than 100 different scientific
tests on the whales, including determining toxicity levels of
internal organs and stomach contents, which he said require the
animals to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   While the legitimacy of Japan's scientific whale hunts is likely
to be debated for some time, the immediate beneficiaries of these
expeditions are ordinary Japanese like Naoshi Goto, a 66-year-old
dentist, who recently enjoyed a bowl of whale soup at Taruichi.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child, we ate miso soup with whale meat every New Year's
Eve,'' Goto said.``It was a centuries-old tradition in my village.
You can't imagine how precious this soup is to me right now.''

 &HT;    Business smoke jumpers drop into hot financial situations
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - RealEstate.com Inc. was in a fix.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Internet start-up faced an audit, and most of
its financial history lay in boxes. So company executives called in
``smoke jumper'' Susan Baader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually had boxes of invoices and paid bills and canceled
checks and bank statements. It was about 15 cardboard boxes,''
recalled Baader, a financial consultant. ``I came in. They set me
up in a conference room with a couple of (temporary helpers) and
said, `Here, have at it. ...''
</P>
<P>
   That was in April 1999. By the time auditors from
PricewaterhouseCoopers arrived in May, Baader had unraveled enough
of the company's financial data for them to review.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the company was ``able to build that road map to
solid financial statements,'' said Bob Sutton, then
RealEstate.com's chief financial officer, who brought in Baader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say I was just the expert in putting out fires,''
said Baader, who has 25 years experience in finance, accounting and
risk management. Baader, 54, now is vice president of finance for
RealEstate.com, which lists real estate for sale online.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke jumpers are tech-age troubleshooters. These fix-it
specialists work quietly and quickly, setting up or repairing the
business end of high-tech start-ups. They're highly skilled, highly
paid and highly sought-after, setting them apart from traditional
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of Web and dot-com companies need to get their products
to market quickly,'' said Pat Turner, associate director in the
contract services division of Matrix Resources, an information
technology staffing firm. ``To do that, you usually need a seasoned
senior-level expert who can come in quickly and size up a problem
and work quickly by either doing it themselves or leading others.
Smoke jumpers jump into time-critical situations. Sometimes it's
the life or death of a business.''
</P>
<P>
   In their rush to get services and products launched, many
high-tech and Internet firms are neglecting the basics of business,
said Michael Nadeau, editorial director of Contract Professional
magazine, a Watertown, Mass.,-based career guide for contractors
and consultants in information technology. Consequently, Nadeau
said, people and projects aren't being managed well and many of the
systems for running a company _ payroll, inventory, accounting,
billing _ aren't in place. ``Traditionally IT workers have been
badly managed,'' Nadeau said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke jumpers are often called in after ``the existing team has
quit because of unrealistic expectations or working impossibly long
hours,'' Nadeau said.
</P>
<P>
   The term is borrowed from U.S. Forest Service terminology for
firefighters who parachute in to suppress fires. It began to be
heard regularly late last year, when many firms were looking for
solutions to anticipated Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke jumpers usually stay with a company three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Many are helping companies tie together payroll, inventory,
accounting and other business systems in what's known as enterprise
resource planning. ``There's not a lot of experience out there in
(ERP) so those projects can get off track,'' Nadeau said.
</P>
<P>
   Initial public offerings provide smoke jumpers with other fires
to put out. Many numbers-crunching jumpers work with startups to
determine when going public is a good idea. They're also being
sought to help start-ups' get venture capital, said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Jumpers can make up to $200 an hour _ roughly twice what their
peers make doing the same job for one company, Nadeau said.
</P>
<P>
   While they make more money, they also assume more risks. When
smoke jumpers fail, it can mean financial losses for their clients
and strained or severed business relationships for the jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Dudar, a smoke jumper for Matrix and a software
architect, likes the challenges of solving other people's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of advantage to going from one problem to
another because you begin to see things from a different
perspective versus looking at it from one angle,'' said Dudar, 35,
who does a lot of work with dot-coms. ``You very often come up with
solutions that you wouldn't usually be able to get from working on
just one business problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What may be a rejected approach at one company may have
newfound value for another company. That happens often and that's
another value of the smoke jumper,'' said Dudar. ``There are no
real clear-cut rules.''
</P>
<P>
   At RealEstate.com ``we needed somebody who could come in, who,
without disrupting me or others in the business, could get this
thing figured out,'' said Sutton, the company's former CFO. ``It
not only takes someone who's competent in accounting but who has
good common sense skills and broad financial business knowledge and
who's not afraid to make decisions.''

   CIR-HIGHSCHOOL-GADGETS (Undated) _ Rohnert Park, Calif., 60
miles north of San Francisco, is mostly white and middle class, but
it is no Lake Wobegon. At the local high school, most of the
students are academically average. SAT scores hover around 1025,
and the dropout rate is 1.7 percent. Some of the sports teams
shine, while others struggle. The homecoming dance in the fall and
the prom in the spring are the year's two social high points. And
like their counterparts around the country, the 2,000 students at
the school, Rancho Cotate, are no strangers to electronic devices.
That makes it as good a place as any to see what kind of gadgets
the thoroughly modern high school student is using these days. When
the Ranch, as the school is called, reopens this fall, students
will arrive with electronic paraphernalia aplenty, their backpacks
heavy with cell phones, pagers, CD players and custom-burned CDs,
as well as graphing calculators and the occasional Palm organizer
and laptop computer. By Katie Hafner.

   CIR-WEB-RESEARCH (Undated) _ For students who grew up with the
Web, the idea of roaming library stacks to do research is as quaint
as the thought of writing with a quill pen. Even though libraries
are organized and easily navigated, students prefer diving into the
chaotic whirl of the Web to find information. One problem with this
strategy is that many students are not well versed in advanced
searching techniques so a simple search for, say, information about
the planet Saturn can yield tens of thousands of hits. Yet students
persevere with this hit-or-miss approach, saying that they are
simply more comfortable sifting through hyperlinks than they are
flipping through a card catalog. And they admit that using the Web
requires less exertion. But while the keyword approach to searching
makes perfect sense to teenagers, it troubles many educators, who
fear that point-and-click research can lead to lazy study habits
and ineffective searches. By Lori Leibovich.

<P>
   CIR-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Students in the freshman class
of 2000 were born at the same time as the original IBM PC. They
grew up with cable TV and Nintendo, learned to program the VCR
before they could ride a bike, became virtuosos with call-waiting
and three-way conference calling and took for granted answering
machines, microwave ovens, audio CDs, pagers, fax machines and cell
phones. Now they are heading off to college, where they will be
immersed in technology more deeply than at any time of their young
lives. As if to prove that the cosmos has a sense of humor, we,
their technologically befuddled parents, are supposed to choose a
computer for these children of the technology age as they head off
to school. Here are some data points that may help. By Peter H.
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   CIR-DORMS-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ During back-to-school season 25
years ago, any list of essential items for dormitory rooms usually
featured one piece of equipment at the top: the stereo. Ten years
later, the stereo still ruled, but another appliance was also
considered essential: the answering machine. How 20th century,
college students today might say. The computer, they declare, is
the only item that could possibly deserve to be first on any list
of dorm necessities. In fact, the computer not only displaces other
technology in importance but also replaces the need for some other
appliances. By Lisa Guernsey.

<P>
   CIR-TEACHING-SOFTWARE (Undated) _ The red phone on your desk
rings sharply in the middle of the night. The voice you hear is
that of the White House chief of staff, alerting you to a crisis in
the Eastern European country of Krasnovia. You're needed at the
White House, pronto. ``We'll send a limo,'' he says, and hangs up.
After an emergency meeting with the president, you're given a
classified intelligence report and access to the country's foremost
diplomats, policy analysts and military leaders. You are to submit
a report in time for a presidential address that evening. The
president is waiting to act on your recommendation. Welcome to high
school, circa 2010. The scene is from an interactive software
course, Crisis in Krasnovia, that its creator, Roger Schank,
believes will revolutionize how children are taught. ``Software is
going to replace classes as we know them,'' said Schank, director
of the Institute for Learning Sciences at Northwestern University.

<P>
   CIR-READING-SCREENS (Undated) _ Some skeptics may believe
something only when they see it in writing, but is the writing more
believable when it is seen on paper rather than on a computer
screen? Apparently it is, based on a recent study at Ohio State
University. The study, which looked at differences in comprehension
of something read on a printed page and the same thing on a
computer screen, found that students who read paper versions found
articles more interesting and persuasive than did the students who
read them on computers. By Catherine Greenman.

MANY SOUTHERNERS SAY LIEBERMAN'S RELIGION IS A NONISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Max Heller had been mayor of Greenville, S.C., for
seven years when he decided to run for Congress in 1978 and
discovered the limits of religious tolerance in the South of the
post-civil rights era.
</P>
<P>
   One of his opponents said Heller should not be elected because
he was Jewish and did not ``believe Jesus Christ has come yet.''
Another opponent, Carroll Campbell, who later became governor,
conducted a poll with the assistance of the consultant Lee Atwater
that reminded voters that Heller was a ``Jewish immigrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller lost that race, and never ran for office again. But
today, as he contemplated with pleasure the selection of Sen.
Joseph Lieberman as the first Jewish member of a national political
ticket, he said he believed his adoptive region had moved far
beyond its earlier distrust of non-Christian candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South has grown up,'' said Heller, 81, who was born in
Vienna. ``So much of the old anti-Semitism is gone now, with all
the new people who've moved in. If the candidate is someone like
Joe Lieberman who is faithful to his religion, I don't think he
would have any problem in the South anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   With his selection of Lieberman, Vice President Al Gore was
probably not expecting to convert any Southern states to his
column, with the possible exception of Florida, which is 4.3
percent Jewish. But both Jewish and non-Jewish leaders in the South
agreed that the presence of an Orthodox Jew on the ticket was no
longer a liability in the nation's most religiously conservative
region.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Guin, the majority leader of the Alabama House of
Representatives, said he had spent the last two days going to
coffee shops and restaurants in the Birmingham area to gauge
reaction to the announcement, and had not even heard a murmur of
discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the sense that his religion is going to make any
difference in the race,'' said Guin, a Democrat from Carbon Hill,
who is a leader of his Methodist church. ``In fact, his being
devout in his faith may even be a benefit in the South. This is a
place where people take religion very seriously, and they like to
see others take it seriously, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his opponents in his last race drew attention to his
religion, Heller said he believed that being an observant Jew was
an important reason he was repeatedly re-elected as mayor of
Greenville _ the home of Bob Jones University and of one of the
highest proportions of conservative Christians in the country _
back in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Friedman, executive director of the Birmingham Jewish
Federation, agreed, saying it was precisely Lieberman's Orthodoxy
that would make him respected among the South's churchgoing
population of Baptists and evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``People respect people of faith,'' he said. ``They value
someone who has developed an authentic relationship of meaning with
his God.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Alabama, like most of the Southern states, is still
expected to vote heavily for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and Guin
wasn't predicting any change. At the moment, Gore is thought to be
a contender only in Florida, Tennessee and possibly Georgia. But
Guin said Gore might actually improve his chances in Alabama by
bringing Lieberman there a few times and campaigning hard.
</P>
<P>
   There have been examples in recent years of Jewish political
candidates in the South whose opponents have made an issue of their
religion. In 1996, John Mitnick, a Republican, tried to unseat U.S.
Rep. Cynthia McKinney in Atlanta, and was accused by McKinney's
father of being ``a racist Jew.'' A campaign flier said Mitnick was
a member of several Jewish groups. Billy McKinney later resigned
from his daughter's campaign and apologized for his comments.
(Mitnick lost a race for the state Senate on Tuesday.)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lee Alcorn, the president of the Dallas chapter of
the NAACP, questioned Lieberman's selection in a manner that
angered many listeners. ``I think we need to be very suspicious of
any kind of partnerships between the Jews at that kind of level
because we know that their interest primarily has to do with money
and these kind of things,'' he said on a radio show. The national
president of the NAACP, Kweisi Mfume, condemned the remarks as
repulsive and anti-Semitic and formally suspended Alcorn from his
post.
</P>
<P>
   There are undoubtedly silent sentiments of anti-Semitism that
persist in the small rural towns, inner cities and gated suburbs of
the South, but public expression of such views remain rare. In
recent years, there have been repeated examples of Jewish
officeholders elected by Southern districts with only a handful of
Jewish voters. Ben Erdreich, a Democrat, represented the Birmingham
area in Congress for five terms in the 1980s and early '90s; Martin
Frost, a Democrat, has represented a Dallas-area congressional
district since 1978; Virginia is likely to have two Jewish
congressmen in November.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's governor, Don Siegelman, is Catholic, but his wife and
children are Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South has grown more tolerant as it has grown more
prosperous,'' said Hastings Wyman, editor of the Southern Political
Report, a newsletter published every two weeks in Washington. ``The
education systems are better, the universities are better funded,
and people are less defensive than they used to be. And we've got
all these Yankees here, now that we've got air conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, according to the National Jewish Population Survey,
about 21 percent of the country's core Jewish population lived in
the South, a number that has probably grown in the last decade. But
the region actually has a much lower percentage of anti-Semitic
incidents, according to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith,
which reported recently that only 12 percent of such incidents in
1999 occurred in the 12 states of the Southeast region. The
majority of the incidents, 58 percent, occurred in the Northeast,
the group said, with 21 percent in the West and 8 percent in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South actually has a better track record than other parts
of the country,'' said Jay Kaiman, the Southeast regional director
of the league, based in Atlanta. ``We've got fringe groups here, of
course, and you never really know what kind of talk goes on in
country clubs or in the backrooms of workplaces. But I think when
it comes to voting, being Jewish is a nonissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean there won't be some suspicion of Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest problem here won't be that he's Jewish,'' said
Kaiman. ``It's that he's a Northerner.''

BARCLAYS NEGOTIATING TO BUY BRITISH MORTGAGE LENDER 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain's third-largest bank, Barclays PLC, said on
Wednesday that it was negotiating to acquire Woolwich PLC, a
leading British mortgage lender, for about 5.5 billion pounds or
$8.3 billion. A deal could be reached by the end of the week,
executives close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies reach an agreement, it would strengthen
Barclays' home mortgage business in Britain as well as accelerate
its Internet banking strategy; Woolwich has been praised for its
comprehensive Internet facilities, which would be integrated into
the Barclays system.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays, which only a few years ago was one of Britain's most
troubled banks, has been on a tear in the past year under its chief
executive, Mathew Barrett, who took over about 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett has cut costs, closed 172 branches and has made several
small acquisitions. The bank has also raised it profile in Britain
with a $22 million advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays said that if the bank makes a bid, it would value each
share of Woolwich at 362 pence, a 34 percent premium over Woolwichs
closing share price on Tuesday. The bank said the offer would be in
cash and stock; 0.1175 shares of Barclays for each Woolwich share
plus 164 pence in cash per share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Woolwich jumped 27 percent, or 72 pence, to 341 pence
or about $5.12. Shares of Barclays dropped 49 pence, or 2.9
percent, to 1,615 pence or about $24.22.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays is making its play for Woolwich at a time when the
mortgage lender's share price has been battered. Woolwich's shares
reached a low on July 31 of 245 pence. The shares had rebounded a
bit since then on speculation that the company could become a
takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   A Barclays-Woowich deal could set off another rash of
consolidation in the British banking industry. While more megadeals
like The Royal Bank of Scotland's recent acquisition of National
Westminster Bank are not expected because of regulatory concerns,
analysts said Britain's other mortgage lenders will become
attractive takeovers targets.
</P>
<P>
   The most watched mortgage lenders include Abbey National,
Alliance &AMP; Leicester and Northern Rock. Almost across the board,
shares of British mortgage lenders have been in falling, making the
group even more attractive.

LAYOFF RATE FALLS IN NEW GOVERNMENT REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the U.S. economy enjoying its longest economic expansion on
record, the number of permanent layoffs declined over the last
three years, the government reported on Thursday. The rate may now
match the lowest in the 20-year history of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The new data also shows that women are now laid off virtually as
often as men, closing a wide gap that had existed for most of the
last 20 years. At the same time, the layoff rate for blacks rose.
And the gap between the layoff rate for blacks compared with whites
widened significantly over the last three years. The layoff rate
for Hispanics, however, dropped sharply, falling below that of
blacks. The differential between whites and Hispanics also
narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   During the three years that ended with 1999, 3.3 million workers
on the job for three years or more were laid off while 4.3 million
workers on the job for less then three years lost their jobs, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in its biennial job
displacement survey. This compares with total layoffs of 8 million,
3.6 million of them on the job for three years or more, from 1995
to 1997. And that is down from a total of 8.4 million in the period
from 1993 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is more drastic when looked at as a percentage of
laid off workers compared with the total number of employed
workers. According to the bureau, that declined to 6.1 percent in
the last three years, from 6.6 percent in 1995 through 1997 and 8
percent in 1993 through 1995. And this 6.1 percent may be near or
even match the low for the survey, which goes back to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The first bureau survey was released in 1984. But because the
way the survey was conducted was changed from five-year periods to
three-year periods in the report released in 1994, it is difficult
to make historical comparisons. Steve Hipple, the economist at the
bureau who oversees the job displacement data, said that the rate
of job layoffs was probably understated in the earlier data.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the case, the 6.1 percent layoff rate from the last
three years may actually be equal to the 5.5 percent rate reported
for 1987 through 1989, the low in the bureau's data.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline in the layoff rate in the last three year was
far less than in the preceding three years, when the rate for all
workers 20 years and older fell 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not surprising that in a strong job market that job loss
declined,'' said Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University
who studies job displacement data. He said that even with a strong
economy, there would be layoffs as some industries shrink while
others grow.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest layoff rate, 5.7 percent, was for workers 45 to 54.
Of all the displaced workers, nearly three-quarters had new jobs by
the time the survey was taken in February. Nearly three-fifths of
those laid off from wage and salary jobs found new jobs that paid
the same or more.
</P>
<P>
   While the layoff rate for blacks did increase to 7.3 percent, it
is still significantly below the level earlier in the 1990s, when
it was as high as 9.4 percent between 1991 and 1995. The increase
in the difference between the layoff rate for blacks and whites
ends six years of narrowing. In the three-year period from 1991
through 1993, the gap was 1.4 percentage points. It narrowed to 0.5
percentage point in the next three-year period and was 0.6
percentage point in 1995 though 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hipple could not say why the gap had widened again. He said that
the existence of a gap was consistent with the fact that the
unemployment rate for whites is lower than that for blacks. But he
said it was hard to tell whether this year's widening of the gap
was a one-time event or not.
</P>
<P>
   Farber, who has worked with the bureau's jobs data for years,
could not comment in detail on the change in the layoff rates for
blacks because he had not yet received the backup data on which
Thursday's release was based. But he said ``the black number is an
interesting number and something to point out.''
</P>
<P>
   The layoff rate of Hispanics fell to 7 percent over the last
three years from 8.8 percent. That is the lowest it has been since
the the 1990-1991 recession. The gap between the white and Hispanic
layoff rate narrowed to 1 percentage point from 2.3 percentage
points in the 1995-97 period.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the layoff rate for women and men has been
narrowing over the last 20 years, with the biggest changes coming
in times of strong job growth. In 1991-93, the gap was 7.4 percent
for women and 8.8 percent for men. That narrowed to 7.6 percent for
women and 8.4 percent for men in 1993-95, to 6.5 percent for women
and 6.7 percent for men in 1995-97 and to 6.1 percent for women and
6 percent for men in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's jobs are concentrated in service industries and the
risk of job losses in services industries has grown over time,''
Hipple said.

ITS PARTS ARE BIGGER THAN SOME OF ITS HOLES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Alan Rudolph doesn't make foreign-language films, but
his movies always seem to come from a strange place: Rudolphland,
where everyone has an idiosyncrasy and outlandish coincidences
become commonplace. When everything falls into alignment, as with
1984's ``Choose Me'' and parts of 1997's ``Afterglow,'' it can be a
wonderful place, but more often it's a frustrating locale to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trixie,'' which Rudolph calls a ``screwball noir,'' contains
some small joys if you're in the right mood, but it's probably very
frustrating if you're not. It features a typical mix of Rudolphian
eccentrics: Wannabe detective Trixie (Emily Watson) who speaks in
an unending stream of malapropisms, redundancies and mixed
metaphors; a second-rate celebrity impersonator (Nathan Lane) with
a drinking problem and a past; a scroungy Lothario (Dermot
Mulroney) who gets Trixie mixed up with gangsters and blackmailers;
and a sleazy senator (Nick Nolte) who becomes the subject of
Trixie's first, um, case. It has to do with the death of a failed
lounge singer (Lesley Ann Warren).
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes way too long to meander into its convoluted
plot, and it's disconcerting to see Watson _ trying on a broad
Chicaaaaago accent _ turn down her natural intelligence; she
appears stiff and uncomfortable playing someone as daffily serious
as Trixie. But Rudolph's screenplay celebrates wordplay in a way
that too few movies do these days; you have to love the English
language to mangle it as amusingly as Rudolph does with the words
that he puts in Trixie's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph cheekily makes the other characters speak in cliches and
platitudes, and Trixie's desecration of the language acts as a
clever counterpoint to their banalities. Rudolph's direction can be
irritatingly loose, and the emphasis on words makes the movie a
little too script-bound. It's drastically uneven, but as Trixie
might say, its parts are bigger than some of its holes.

DRINKING CLAIMS BY OPPOSTIION LEADER HAS BRITAIN ASTIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ William Hague, a lad?
</P>
<P>
   Baring his soul to a men's magazine, the sober and serious
leader of the British opposition party confessed this week that in
his teenage years he drank a lot of beer, as many as 14 pints a
day.
</P>
<P>
   But if it was a bid to boost his electoral appeal with so-called
``lads,'' the beer-swilling yuppies who make up a sizable
constituency in Britain, it flopped. His claim has been met mostly
with skepticism and derision.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lying little toad,'' said Terry Glossop, assistant
manager of the Angel, one of the pubs in Hague's hometown in
Yorkshire, where he claims he used to knock back pints while on his
summer job delivering soft drinks and beer for his father's
distributing business. ``No one can remember Hague coming in for as
much as a half a lager.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Glossop said, Hague was known for his taste for soda
pop, earning him the nickname ``Billy the Fizz.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun tabloid treated Hague's claims with characteristic
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Liar!'' Wednesday's headline blared.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of blare, you never hear Hague's nemesis, the
circumspect prime minister Tony Blair, boasting of his drinking
exploits. According to fans and critics alike, Blair is not only
sober, he is downright boring.
</P>
<P>
   But Hague is widely considered even more boring, which is why
most political pundits believe Hague sat down with the British
edition of GQ magazine and admitted to serial pint downing in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   GQ in Britain is different from its sister publication in the
United States. Here it is one of a genre aimed at the ``laddism''
subculture of middle-class British men who revel in drinking,
yelling rude things at women, and generally acting like boors.
</P>
<P>
   This, apparently, is the constitutency that Hague's confessional
was aimed at. But according to many political observers, his
admission to a youthful indiscretion backfired horribly _ not
because it reveals a character flaw, but because no one believes he
really drank all those pints.
</P>
<P>
   At Conservative Party headquarters Wednesday, a cheerful press
officer declined to answer questions, saying only, ``The article
stands for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   It says something about Britain, a nation where binge drinking
is a major problem, that more people were asking whether the man
who wants to be the next prime minister was exaggerating his
drinking prowess than whether he, like many other Britons, had a
drinking problem in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   At offices of Alcohol Concern, the national agency that combats
alcohol abuse, Lisa Leonard sounded depressed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have hoped that someone in a position like Mr. Hague
would have urged people to engage in responsible drinking,'' said
Leonard, the communications director. ``It's very sad that because
of our drinking culture, being able to drink excessive amounts of
beer is seen as a positive quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said that in terms of total consumption, Britons rank in
the middle of the pack among Europeans, but British teenagers drink
more than their European peers. She said Britain has the highest
incidence in Europe of alcohol-related violence, much of it traced
to binge drinking. The government, she noted, recommends that
people drink no more than two pints a day, so if Hague was telling
the truth, he routinely drank seven times that.
</P>
<P>
   The bald, slight Hague, who looks older than his 39 years, has
always been something of a nebbish. His detractors suggest he is
kind of goofy.
</P>
<P>
   But, like many supposed nerds, Hague is smart. He burst onto the
national scene as a 16-year-old in 1977, when he wowed a
Conservative Party conference with a rousing speech that showcased
his oratorical skills _ not to mention an Osmond brothers haircut
that showed off a head of hair that, alas, melted away like the
Conservative majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview with GQ, Hague seemed to want to distance
himself from his sober image, saying he downed pints like a
stevedore while delivering crates of soft drinks and beers to pubs
all over South Yorkshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks I used to spend my holidays reading
political tracts should have come with me for a week,'' he boasted.
``We used to have a pint at every stop . . . and we used to have
about 10 stops a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You worked so hard you didn't feel you'd drunk 10 pints by
four o'clock, you used to sweat so much. But then you had to lift
all the empties off the lorry. It's probably horrifying but we used
to do that, then go home for tea, and then go out in the evening to
the pub.''
</P>
<P>
   Hague, a judo expert who is in superb physical condition,
stressed he no longer drinks anywhere near as much.
</P>
<P>
   The whole experience, he went on ``was a great education,
actually. Knowing what Labor voters feel like as well as
Conservatives. I think I learned more going round the clubs of
Barnsley than I learned at Oxford about the human race in
general.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is probably true, but few people seem to believe
him, at least the part about sinking 14 pints in a day.
</P>
<P>
   John Perry, editor of Loaded, the granddaddy of the ``lad''
magazines, was skeptical of Hague's claims, calling it as an
attempt to woo younger voters. Perry said the strategy was ``a
slippery slope, like wearing a baseball cap.'' Unless Hague goes
out, drinks 14 pints, then walks onto the floor of the House of
Commons, he said, the ``lads'' won't believe it anyway.

MOSCOW ARRESTS SUSPECTS BUT CAN'T LINK ANY TO FATAL BOMBING
</HEADLINE>
  By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian law enforcement officials said Wednesday they
had detained a number of suspects in their investigation into the
terrorist bombing of an underground pedestrian walkway that killed
seven people and wounded 97 Tuesday evening. But they said that so
far none could be linked directly to the bombing in the heart of
the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual rebuke to Moscow, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who was
quick to attribute the bombing to Chechens, who have been fighting
for independence from Russia, President Vladimir Putin said
Wednesday that ``it would be wrong'' to ``brand a whole people'' in
the absence of proof of who was behind the bombing. Police
authorities and prosecutors also said they had no evidence of
Chechen involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's admonition reflected the political sensitivities of
Russian leaders who are trying to build a viable new government in
Chechnya, said Alexei Zudin, a political analyst. The rush to
judgment exemplified by Luzhkov's statements, he said, fed the
worst suspicions of Chechen civilians who have suffered through two
rebellions and two devastating invasions by the Russian military
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blame for this affair cannot be generalized to all Chechens,''
Zudin said, even if evidence gathered eventually points toward the
rebellious republic, where rebel leaders have in recent weeks
threatened to strike Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Putin said Russia would carry on the military campaign
``to its completion'' and ``finish off terrorists in their own
den.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, combined Russian security forces said they had
scoured 160 subway stations and underground passageways using
bomb-sniffing dogs to ensure that the capital's public transit
system with its extensive maze of interconnecting tunnels was clear
of explosives. At Moscow's Kazansky railway station police
reportedly found nearly nine pounds of TNT as well as seven
detonators, which were not hooked up to the explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Muscovites were back underground as usual,
with thousands of them passing through the reopened, though charred
passageways beneath Pushkin Square, where vendors picked through
the debris in their shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we will go back to work here,'' said one middle-aged
woman sorting through the lingerie in her darkened kiosk. ``And of
course we are scared,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The low granite walls along the exits from the underground
passageways had already become memorial altars, where friends,
relatives and passersby laid carnations and lilies to express their
sympathy for those who died. Russian television reported Wednesday
night that Putin, too, visited the square and laid flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they were working with three witnesses who
saw two men bargaining at a leather goods shop in the tunnel and
who dashed for an exit leaving a satchel behind that exploded
moments after the salesgirl summoned a security officer to inspect
the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, speaking at the Kremlin, struck a note of calm
resolution, admonishing Russians that terrorism was an
``international illness'' for which the only cure was ``political
will,'' the ``vigilance of the people'' and effective law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists, he said, ``count on bloodshed, sensation, panic and
hysteria.'' And he warned that ``disorganization and disorder would
make the best possible gift for them.''

CLINTON HONORS 15 WITH PRESIDENTIAL MEDALS OF FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidents get to hand out plenty of perks _ from
ambassadorships and State Dinner invitations to, on the low end of
the scale, specially made boxes of M&AMP;Ms bearing the presidential
seal.
</P>
<P>
   With just five months left in his term, and his opportunities
for give-backs dwindling, President Clinton on Wednesday singled
out 15 people for Presidential Medals of Freedom, the country's
highest civilian honor. Some of the awards seemed to represent
belated presidential thank-yous. Some clearly had a political
twist. At least one was a consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the awards, Clinton said he had huddled with his
Senate candidate wife in recent weeks to review the possibilities,
upstanding people from all walks of life nominated by aides and
outsiders alike.
</P>
<P>
   The honorees crowded the stage in the East Room. John Kenneth
Galbraith, the Harvard economist, sat next to Monsignor George G.
Higgins, a labor activist, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is
Clinton's envoy to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many things that I and the president are going to
miss about living and being part of the White House's life but
nothing more than this ceremony,'' said Hillary Rodham Clinton
during the elaborate ceremony featuring a Marine band, smartly
dressed military aides and the attendance of much of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the selection process itself is cloaked in mystery,
Mrs. Clinton perhaps had a role in advocating the names of Marian
Wright Edelman, her first boss at the Children's Defense Fund; the
Rev. Gardner C. Taylor, a prominent preacher from Brooklyn who has
backed her campaign; and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the man she
hopes to succeed in the Senate representing New York.
</P>
<P>
   The award was a consolation prize for Wesley K. Clark, who was
supreme allied commander of NATO during the air campaign over
Kosovo but lost out in his goal of becoming chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Now an investment banker, he wore a dark suit
instead of a uniform but still stood ramrod straight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, over the course of his presidency, has doled out 83 of
the gold medallions decorated with red, white and blue _ half a
dozen during his first year, only a pair in 1997, 17 during the
mid-point of his second term. There are no limits to the number of
medals that can be issued, and although White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said this was the final medal ceremony of the year, he
added, ``The president always reserves the right to do something on
a more ad hoc basis near the end of the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always reached out to Republicans in handing out the
awards, a practice he continued this year. Former Sen. Bob Dole won
the honor the year after he lost to Clinton in the 1996
presidential race. Former President Gerald Ford joined former
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, in the East Room
Ceremony in 1999. This year, John Chafee, the late Rhode Island
senator, won the award posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   Other honorees this year included Holocaust survivor Simon
Wiesenthal, who listened to the ceremony by telephone while
recovering from a fall; Cruz Reynoso, a former judge from
California who is vice chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights; former Sen. George McGovern, who was the 1972 Democratic
presidential nominee; James Edward Burke, chairman of the
Partnership for a Drug-Free America; William Crowe, former chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Mildred Jeffrey, a labor activist;
and Mathilde Krim, founder of the AIDS Medical Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highest honor of my life,'' said McGovern. ``I
treasure it even more than running for the presidency of the United
States. If I had won, that would have been the greatest honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, he would have been the one handing out medals.

   ``The Replacements'' tries to set some kind of record for
regurgitating sports movie cliches faster than any film that's run
before. Basically ``Major League'' for football, this formulaic
comedy is quick enough to recycle the grossest joke from the last
gridiron film, ``Any Given Sunday,'' the one about throwing up on
the field in the middle of the big game.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about as swift as ``The Replacements'' gets.
</P>
<P>
   In this one, a faux NFL goes on strike late in the season, just
as the Washington Sentinels are nearing a long-withheld shot at a
playoff berth. The team's sneaky owner (Jack Warden) hires coach
Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman), whose stellar career was cut short by
``that Dallas mess,'' to put together a winning scab team. In a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy's first hire is Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), an exceptional
college quarterback whose pro chances were cut short by that
``Sugar Bowl choke'' nobody ever seems to forget. A contingent of
lovably eccentric losers suits up in his wake. There's a receiver
who can't catch (Orlando Jones), a psychopathic SWAT cop (Jon
Favreau), assorted racial caricatures that include gun-totin' twin
bodyguards and a sumo wrestler and, just to make for a complete
entertainment experience, a deaf guy.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, the cheerleaders strike along with the
athletes, probably so there can be funny/degrading auditions for
new pep squad members. This also provides an excuse for hiring
dancers from a local strip club, whose distinctive routines
director Howard Deutch is so evidently fond of he cuts in more and
more shots of them as the film wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Brooke Langton's nice gal cheer choreographer
provides love interest and moral support for the uncertain Reeves
character. And he needs all of the latter he can get, even though
there's no doubt from the kickoff that he'll lead his screwballs to
self-esteem and glory. Outside of these prescribed calculations,
there are some mildly interesting observations on the prima donna
natures of overpaid professional athletes. Then again, that's
probably just smoke for the movie's real, union-bashing agenda.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it's become almost as tedious to note that Reeves
gives a passable performance (the onetime ``Whoa!'' dude has been
doing that for years) as it is to mention that Hackman once again
walks through another paycheck (which the sporadically great actor
has been doing for decades now). But we'll acknowledge, for the
record, that that's what both stars do. Everyone else inhabits
stereotypes like the animated cutout writer Vince McKewin imagined.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden and Pat Summerall appear as themselves in an attempt
to reinforce the illusion that real football is being played. Their
efforts are undermined by the uncharacteristically inept
cinematography of Tak Fujimoto (``The Sixth Sense,'' ``The Silence
of the Lambs'') which, somewhat due to the film's lapdance editing,
demonstrates little understanding of how the game actually works.
</P>
<P>
   What is certainly understood here, however, is the mechanics of
superficial sport comedy uplift. This probably earns points in some
studio playbook, if not on the screen where it counts. &QL;

`MOSAIC THUMP' IS INTELLIGENT BUT FLAWED
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out of ideas or hoping to cash in on past fame, a lot of
groundbreaking bands often wind up retreading the ground they
broke. Long Island hip-hop trio De La Soul is one of the few
groups, rap or otherwise, that don't look to their past to bank on
a secure future. No doubt, the trio's days of opening doors, as
well as minds, seem to be gone. But the guys _ Kelvin Mercer, David
Joliceur and Vince Mason _ are still making relevant, intelligent
music, as they've done on ``Art Official Intelligence: Mosaic
Thump,'' their first effort in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art'' is different from the threesome's previous efforts; it's
almost the flipside to its 11-year-old masterful debut, ``3 Feet
High and Rising,'' which pushed rap's envelope in an entirely
different direction with its mingling of hip-hop, reggae and jazz,
and its low-key humor and peace-and-love lyrics, which directly
defied the then-burgeoning gangsta-rap scene.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly low-key. Most of ``Art,'' supposedly the first in
a three-disc series to be released in a year's time, has a
house-party vibe, sort of a first for De La. As with any good
party, there's a ton of guests, from Busta Rhymes to Chaka Khan to
members of the Beastie Boys. The Beasties' Mike D and Ad Rock's
turn on the rambunctious ``Squat!'' is one of the best things here.
</P>
<P>
   But De La hasn't lost its intellectual edge. Songs like ``My
Writes, Declaration'' and ``View'' may be upbeat, but the yrics
still address compelling issues, namely the corroding state of
hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps this from ranking up there with De La's first effort:
too much filler, too much production. There are 17 tracks here, and
about five of them _ including the overly syrupy ``With Me'' and
the Quincy Jones-sampled ``Foolin' '' _ should have been axed.
</P>
<P>
   The production is a little too polished, too. A raw, organic
sound flows through their early records. That sound has been
replaced by studio slickness _ the same slickness found on most
other hip-hop discs. Hope production is as close as these guys come
to being like everyone else. &QL;

REFORM FACTIONS MAY HOLD COMPETING CONVENTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ With two factions hopelessly divided, the
Reform Party faces the prospect that a pair of competing national
conventions will open Thursday to nominate rival presidential
candidates and further complicate a struggle for $12.6 million in
federal campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials opposing Patrick Buchanan's attempt to take over the
party carried out an early morning raid Wednesday on a convention
hall room designated for a credentials committee meeting, blocked
the Buchanan group from entering, and set up their own process to
validate delegates to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Buchanan's supporters in the party hierarchy were
forced to throw up a makeshift operation in an adjacent room to
certify Buchanan delegates.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides were claiming to represent the Reform Party,
several hundred prospective delegates began descending on Long
Beach, and emotions were boiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be outsmarted again,'' said Gerry Moan, the acting
national chairman who has sided with the Buchanan interests. He
vowed to open the Reform Party convention in the appointed hall,
even if he had to sleep inside the building to fend off Buchanan's
opponents. Moan blamed the disruptions on members still affiliated
with the party's founder, Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Though apparently outnumbered, the Perot group insisted they
were carrying out the legitimate business of the party. They said
they were prepared to conduct their own convention simultaneously
at another location in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on a parallel course,'' said Russell Verney, a Perot
associate and former national chairman who is leading the fight to
thwart Buchanan. ``We're going foward with our credentials process,
our convention and our own nomination.'' The anti-Buchanan group is
allied behind John Hagelin, who is already running for president
under the banner of the Natural Law Party.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said he expected the bifurcated party to produce two
nominees who would both petition the Federal Election Commission
for the $12.6 million due to the Reform Party. Though Buchanan is
counting on receiving the money by Labor Day, the rancorous fight
could tie up the funds for months.
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic bravado, Buchanan arrived in Long Beach
Wednesday afternoon, proclaimed the battle won and told a claque of
his supporters in a hotel driveway: ``Be gentle with those fellows
who are giving us a hard time. They're having a difficult World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the confusion, Buchanan tried to strike a Harry
Truman pose by displaying a newspaper with a front page photo of
two of ``those fellows,'' Verney and national secretary Jim Mangia,
appearing in distress. But Buchanan held the paper upside down and
turned to the wrong page, until informed that he was botching the
photo opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have these little tiffs and disputes behind us
by Sunday,'' Buchanan promised. But that seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier press conference, Mangia accused Buchanan of
``brown shirt'' tactics. ``We have a situation where the Buchanan
campaign is attempting to subvert, corrupt, pervert and destroy the
process.'' He charged that the ``Buchanan brigadeers'' had roughed
up Perot loyalists when Buchanan's forces seized control of a
national committee meeting here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, please,'' said Moan when told of the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   During a confrontation in the convention hall, Moan mounted
steps to direct Buchanan's delegates to a new location for their
credentialing process. He was shouted down by a group from the
Perot faction.
</P>
<P>
   Mangia then took over the position, only to be hooted by a
chorus of ``Go Pat Go!'' from the Buchanan delegates.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Long Beach police, equipped with truncheons, were
deployed to the scene, but the battle did not escalate beyond
high-pitched screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed to hold majorities on the party's 160-member
national committee. The Buchanan group said it held 115 seats;
their opposition insisted upon their own majority of 89.
</P>
<P>
   While the Buchanan-friendly ``national committee'' was busy
revoking last month's decision by a 10-member executive committee
aligned with Perot to disqualify Buchanan as a candidate, the other
``national committee'' ratified the move late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When the formal convention opens this morning, Buchanan's sister
and campaign manager Bay Buchanan said, there will be 596
delegates, ``and 410 will be ours.''
</P>
<P>
   But dozens of the delegate seats are being challenged, and it
seemed likely that the Reform Party would split like an amoeba
before the end of the day.

&HT;     DEBATES WILL PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THIS ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just as George W. Bush got a big bounce in the
polls from the Republican National Convention, so will Vice
President Al Gore from the Democratic convention next week.
</P>
<P>
   But a bigger test for both will come when they kick off their
October debates. That's when the voters will really start paying
attention to the men who would be president.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has not been enthusiastic about the match-ups
with his Democratic counterpart, but a Bush spokesman, Ray Selleck,
says, ``There will be debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush relies heavily on what he calls his ``good advisers'' to
articulate his policies. But you can bet he will be well coached
when the first debate rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, is licking his chops over the prospect
of going into the arena with Bush. With 16 years of experience as a
congressman and senator from Tennessee and eight years as vice
president, Gore knows the domestic and international issues that
will come up.
</P>
<P>
   He is remembered for trouncing Ross Perot, the feisty Reform
Party candidate, in a joint TV appearance in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Simple as it sounds, I recommend that both candidates go to the
grocery store before the debates and get the lowdown on grassroots
prices. In the past, candidates have marred their campaigns by
tripping up on the cost of everyday goods, giving voters the
impression that they are out of touch with the common people.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the current candidates is known for high eloquence or
inspiring rhetoric in the manner of Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A.
Douglas in their historic debates of 1858.
</P>
<P>
   But in the recent past it's often the little things that count _
the gaffe that hurt and the repetitive one-liner that disarmed the
more earnest foe. So there are pitfalls even when the debaters have
been coached for weeks and are primed for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many memorable moments in modern debates. In
1988 comedians joked for months about Lloyd Bentsen's rapier
response to Dan Quayle, who linked himself to President John F.
Kennedy in the vice presidential debate: ``Senator, I served with
Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of
mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a debate in 1984 with Walter Mondale, President Reagan
startled millions of viewers as he rambled on about ``riding down
the California highway.'' He appeared to have lost his train of
thought and had a hard time getting back on track.
</P>
<P>
   He later recounted in his post-presidency autobigraphy that he
had ``crammed so hard on facts and figures, I flattened out.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he had ``spent too many hours pouring over
briefing books and at skull sessions and mock debates preparing for
the encounter, and on the night of the debate I think I was just
over-trained.''
</P>
<P>
   When that debate was over, his wife Nancy was furious with his
aides for over-prepping him. Afterward, there was no question who
was in charge of scheduling the candidate. She was.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never forget the debate between President Gerald Ford and
Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter in October, 1976 when Ford said
there was ``no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a collective gasp in the audience, and the questioner,
New York Times correspondent Max Frankel, tried to get Ford off the
hook by asking if he meant that Russians did not have a ``sphere of
influence` in Europe. But Ford did not take the lifeline and
reiterated there was no Soviet domination of Poland, Yugoslavia and
Romania.
</P>
<P>
   That became THE story. It took Ford five days to acknowledge his
mistake. But the faux pas hurt him and he lost the election.
</P>
<P>
   When Reagan was challenging President Jimmy Carter in 1980, he
later recalled of their late October debate that it ``went well for
me and may have turned on only four little words.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, which Reagan said just ``popped out of my mouth,''
were ``there he goes again'' after Carter accused him of opposing
Medicare benefits for Social Security recipients. Reagan repeated
the taunt several times in response to Carter attacks on his ultra
conservative positions. And the tactic worked. As Reagan said,
``The audience loved it ''
</P>
<P>
   He thought he scored even bigger when at the end of the debate,
he turned to the TV audience and suggested that people ask
themselves, ``Are you better off now than you were four years
ago?''
</P>
<P>
   That's one line George W. Bush can't steal. He might not like
the answer in this era of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gore has the proud resume, Bush can present the winning
personality. And following Reagan's example, he could use a teasing
quip and throw the more intense Gore off balance.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Bush's handlers are already laying the groundwork
for low expectations. When he's asked about what kind of
performance Bush will give in the debates against Gore, Bush's
chief campaign strategist, Karl Rove, paints Gore as a veteran of
political jousts and a master of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to survive,'' Rove says, trying to keep a
straight face.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope Gore will overplay his hand and come across as
a know-it-all, generating sympathy for Bush. The Texas governor,
who had debates with several other presidential aspirants in the
GOP primaries, takes after his feisty mother, Barbara Bush, and may
have some gibes of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Mannerisms are also important. In a 1992 debate, President
George Bush did not help himself in a three-way debate with Bill
Clinton and Ross Perot by looking at his watch and apparently
wondering when the ordeal would end.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, the elder Bush did not help his Brahmin
image in 1984 when he bragged to a group of hardhats the day after
his vice presidential debate with Democrat Geraldine Ferraro. He
said he had ``kicked a little last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of the current candidates could have a problem if Patrick
Buchanan of the Reform Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party
join one of the debates. If that occurs, fasten your seat belts.
Neither Buchanan nor Nader is a shrinking violet, and the whole
thing could turn into a four-ring circus.

PUTTING THEIR BEST FOOT FORWARD
</HEADLINE>

By BARBARA De WITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Non-fashion reporters who wouldn't know a bias cut from a bugle
bead (or care), took a break Tuesday night from Democratic National
Convention preparations to see the city's more fashionable side.
</P>
<P>
   Bused from the Staples Center to the nearby CaliforniaMart,
located in the downtown Fashion District, more than 200 reporters
and photographers put their politics aside to watch ``This Way
L.A.,'' a slick fashion showcase of more than 200 designs by 22 of
the city's most cutting-edge designers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The event also attracted a number of community leaders,
including Lee Harrington, president of the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp., who welcomed the crowd, and Mayor
Richard Riordan, who joked about his reputation as the city's
worst-dressed mayor. The show was sponsored by L.A. By Design, a
program of the LAEDC, as well as the Port of Los Angeles, the
Fashion District, the California Apparel News and the
CaliforniaMart, which was recently purchased by Hertz Investment
Group, a local real estate company.
</P>
<P>
   Ilse Metchek, event director and executive director of the
California Fashion Association, LAEDC, said holding the show just
before the convention was a great way to ``introduce the press
corps to one of the city's most creative business opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Few people, even the fashion press, realize that Los Angeles
is the No. 1 apparel manufacturing sector with a gross revenue of
$17.5 billion a year,'' said Metchek. ``Although New York is the
No. 1 marketing center, more than 107,000 people are employed in
the Los Angeles fashion district at the manufacturing level, with
another 20,000 people in the textile area that supports the apparel
manufacturing process. And then there are another 1,000 people who
represent the manufacturers with offices at the CaliforniaMart and
the New Mart (located across the street from the CaliforniaMart),
plus countless other reps who work out of their homes,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Metchek calls Los Angeles the home of throwaway chic, a city
known for cutting-edge fashion that's seen around the world in
movies, on T, and on pop-culture icons such as Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike New York, which is famous for its tailoring and
structured garments, we have a reputation for clothes of the moment
that may or may not catch on in the rest of the country _ or the
world,'' Metchek said, adding that local designers don't have a
fear of failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I teach at local design schools such as the Fashion Institute
of Design and Merchandising, and Otis, and I have discovered
there's a real entrepreneurial climate here,'' Metchek said.
``Students tell me they'd rather start up their own company in a
garage and do every aspect of the manufacturing than (go to New
York and) be mentored by somebody like Donna Karan.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's event reflected this L.A. spirit by showcasing designs
in themes such as Venice Beach, Melrose Place, Hollywood Studios,
Olvera Street, Pacific Connection, North of Montana and Sunset
Plaza. The show started off on a hot note, with female models in
scant bathing suits and men in plaid and leather sandals _ a la
Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Tadashi Shoji, a graduate of L.A. Trade Technical College and a
high- profile example of this new breed of designer, showcased his
gowns for the more elegant Hollywood Studios segment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied lots of old films, so the press will probably notice
all of the Old Hollywood influences ... and how I pay tribute to
the glamour of stars such as Gloria Swanson, Marilyn Monroe, Rita
Hayworth and Jean Harlow in the Hollywood segment of the fashion
show,'' Shoji said in a phone conversation from his Los Angeles
offices before the show.
</P>
<P>
   His well-cut suits will soon be seen on Minnie Driver in the
film ``Beautiful,'' scheduled for a September release. Shoji
explained that he draws, drapes and oversees everything for his
small company, called Tadashi, and that allows him to keep his
prices more affordable than many East Coast evening wear labels.
His gowns, sold at local department stores such as Macy's,
Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus, as well as smaller chain stores
such as Aames and Cache, reflect his interest in costume design.
</P>
<P>
   In the Venice Beach segment, the press was treated to a new line
of young and sassy swimsuits called Becca Swim by Rebecca Virtue.
Born and raised in Southern California, Virtue simply looked to
local beaches and the colorful characters on the boardwalk for
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   And the collection shown Tuesday night included styles with
henna body art embroidered onto the suits to give the illusion of a
tattoo, as well as silver rings sewn onto bra tops for a pierced
punk look, and belly chains integrated onto low-slung bikini
bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Crank, the CEO of Lunada Bay, which is the umbrella
company for Becca Swim, said, ``We were very excited to have the
CaliforniaMart approach us about `This Way L.A.' because it gave us
an opportunity to be recognized as the powerhouse of casual
fashion. By that I mean we approach swimwear from a creative
viewpoint with a cutting edge, compared to East Coast swimsuit
manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Becca Swim, which should hit local stores by the end of
the month, Lunada Bay manufactures about 2 million suits a year for
a number of trendy labels such as XOXO, Mossimo, Girl Star and
bebe.
</P>
<P>
   The Melrose Place segment drew applause as muscle-bound male
models stripped off their bathrobes to reveal the latest looks in
mens underwear, and other models showed off Private Circle's
split-knee black faux leather pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're extremely sexy. Anything you can destroy and
keep beautiful is amazing,'' Danny Cook said of his label's
``tattered'' pants, which retail at about $88.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers who participated in the fashion show were
street-savvy names such as BC Ethic, Tru Supply, Lunar Doll, Epoch,
Dawls, Sunde, BonBons, White Rose and the new lingerie company
called Hipster G. More established labels, such as Poleci,
Hartnell, La Blanca, Casadei, Barbara Lesser, Canyon Group and
Claire's Collection were featured, as well work by the
Valencia-raised designer David Dart.
</P>
<P>
   Dart, who recently moved his offices from Chatsworth to downtown
L.A., has seen his designs on plenty of stars, from Michelle
Pfeiffer to Brooke Shields, but not on any red-carpet soirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Los Angeles, there are two fashion camps. Those who
make fashion exciting on Oscar night, and those like me, who create
fashion for every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To catch a glimpse of fashion's future, Genevieve Ostrander,
marketing director for L.A. By Design, included a collection of
designs by students from the Otis School of Design in the red,
white and blue finale. While Hipster G. gave the finale an American
flair with cowboy-, Indian-, hippie- and Lady Liberty-inspired
wear.
</P>
<P>
   The ``This Way L.A.'' fashion show is one of several events
sponsored by the LAEDC to create awareness of the city's creative
industries. Other events to be staged throughout the year will
focus on toy manufacturing, food, aerospace, architecture,

STING WORKS HIS MAGIC AT THE GREEK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes you can't escape your past.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 40 minutes into Sting's show at the Greek Theatre
on Tuesday (the first of four nights) when _ as if on cue _ the
audience stood up as the British rocker played the first few notes
of the Police hit ``Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic'' from the
1981 album ``Ghost in the Machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Sting had done a mixture of songs from his
Grammy-winning new album, ``Brand New Day,'' and songs from earlier
in his solo career. Taking the stage dressed in a sleeveless black
T-shirt and grayish-black cargo pants, the trim 48-year-old Sting
with his short-cropped blond hair doesn't look much different than
he did when he hit the rock scene with the Police in the late '70s.
Backed by a a tight six-piece band with guitarist Dominic Miller
and keyboardist Kipper, he kicked off his one-hour, 50-minute set
with the atmospheric ``A Thousand Years'' from his new album, then
segued into ``If You Love Somebody Set Them Free'' from his first
solo album, 1985's ``The Dream of the Blue Turtles.''
</P>
<P>
   With his bass guitar slung low, Sting bounced or swayed his hips
to the music as he sang. Unlike many of today's acts who churn out
the music on stage like it's from a jukebox, Sting and bandmates
interacted like, well, a real band, and while the interpretations
of songs for the most part didn't depart radically from the album
versions, they at least had an organic feel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his superstar status (the limos were triple-parked
outside the theater with license plates that read stuff like ``A
List''), there was nothing like that in Sting's stage presence,
which emanated a joyfulness and playfulness that has endeared him
to his fans. During his first break in the music, he looked out
into the audience and saw two young women holding a sign. He read
it to the crowd. ``We want to belly dance for you,'' it said.
``I'll get back to you later,'' he told the women. Toward the end
of the set he asked the security guard to bring the two women to
the stage, and after hugs, introduced them as Angie and Sue.
</P>
<P>
   He then launched into his recent hit ``Desert Rose,'' a
seductive song of longing with a Middle Eastern flavor. As it
turned out, Angie and Sue weren't bad, but not professional by a
long shot, as they scrambled to make up their choreography as they
went along. Women probably want to dance for Sting at every
concert, so the singer may have done something like this before.
What made the moment, though, was that Sting seemed so unconcerned
that the women would somehow disrupt the performance as they
careened around the stage. (Perhaps it's a sad note that in the
tightly controlled world of music, there is little left to chance.)
</P>
<P>
   With a more than 20-year career and numerous chart-topping
songs, Sting can make almost any concert seem like a greatest-hits
collection. Some of the highlights included older songs like
``Fields of Gold,'' ``An Englishman in New York,'' ``If I Ever Lose
My Faith in You,'' ``Every Breath You Take'' (unofficially known as
the stalker song), ``Moon Over Bourbon Street'' (with a nice Louis
Armstrong growl and driving trumpet) plus songs off his new album
such as ``After the Rain Has Fallen'' and ``Fill Her Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sting has taken a few dings in the press lately for his
associations with big money. Compaq sponsors his tour and he does a
commercial for a luxury car company using the song ``Desert Rose.''
Part of the criticism stems from the fact that he has always
championed causes like saving the Amazon rain forest, so to some it
seems like a sellout. However, he has continued to support his
causes. (The irony here is that so few of the younger acts today _
whether they're pop, alt rock or hip-hop and rap _ display any
social conscience at all. In fact, quite the opposite _ yet little
is made of that.)
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, you get the feeling Sting could roll out of
bed and write a hit pop song, but that he has had other ambitions.
Instead, he has incorporated elements from his jazz background and
world music in his work. Watching him Tuesday it was clear that he
was more interested in his newer, more complex tunes; nevertheless,
he didn't begrudge his fans their love of oldies and gave them what
they came for. His second-to-last number, which was during his
third encore, was a lovely version of the Police's ``Message in a
Bottle,'' which he did without his band, accompanying himself on
guitar. He turned the pop quality of the tune into a wistfulness,
and it worked perfectly as a lead-in to the lovely ``Fragile'' from
his 1987 album ``Nothing Like the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For all those born beneath an angry star/ Lest we forget how
fragile we are/ On and on the rain will fall/ Like tears from a
star, like tears from a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Sting to sober up an intoxicating evening. &QL;

<P>
   For anyone who'd actually be interested in watching, ``Bob
Dylan: American Troubador'' could be retitled, ``Everything You
Already Knew About Bob Dylan and Didn't Have to Ask.'' It's a fan's
high-school term paper with such audio-visual aids as archival
footage of '50s Minneapolis, a New York blizzard and race riots,
combined with a line or two from a handful of Dylan classics.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the program's stunning lack of insight
into Dylan is the paltry band of witnesses it rounds up _
gnarly-toothed geezers who knew Dylan back in the day, a couple of
session guys, folks who apparently never even met the guy but have
listened to his albums (hey, you and I could probably be in this
film). Only The Band's Levon Helm, who appears here, could be said
to have spent any meaningful time with him, and his observations
are none too acute.
</P>
<P>
   There's a particularly strong '60s bent to the material, where
the inspirations for even semi-obscure songs are discussed at
length, while entire albums of the '70s, '80s and '90s aren't even
mentioned. (Potentially interesting subjects, such as the
underground controversy surrounding Dylan's authorship of ``Blowin'
in the Wind,'' perhaps his most famous song, are of course
ignored.) Dylan's previously well-documented '60s rate an hour of
the documentary, while the '80s and '90s scarcely rate 15 minutes,
when those are the decades that hold the most questions _ such as
how the heck did he tumble so far, anyway? And how did he muster
enough oomph to put together one last great album, 1997's ``Time
Out of Mind?''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan never comes off as particularly friendly _ or, in archival
interviews, even as vaguely articulate _ but his misanthropy is
hardly challenged or explored beyond a sweeping nod to the
``pressures of fame.'' Interviewees mainly spend their time trying
to convince us of his greatness, which seems fairly unnecessary
given his still-substantial place in pop music history.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, the producers do un-earth one hilariously jaw-dropping
piece of footage _ a kitschy, Vegas-style tribute to Dylan from the
'60s. And the snippets of music here should be enough to inspire
fans to dust off their Dylan CDs and give them another play. Which
can be done without, and more entertainingly than, sitting through
this perfunctory exercise in hagiography. &QL;

``The Opportunists'' is a modest, slice-of-life film that tries,
seemingly against its will, to turn into a caper yarn, with a
standard-issue reformed crook dragged, also against his will, back
for one last heist.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Walken does a fair approximation of an average guy _
well, there is a scene or two in which a line reading recalls the
nut cases he's built his career essaying _ playing Victor Kelly, a
former safecracker with a heart of gold. Now, he's a
none-too-talented auto mechanic with a mountain of debt and a
bar-owning girlfriend (former pop novelty Cyndi Lauper, who's OK
except she always needs to do something with her hands) who wants
to lend him money and keep him on the straight and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course it's not that easy. In drifts Michael Lawler
(Peter McDonald), an Irish scam artist who claims familial roots
while at the same time hitting on Vic's daughter (Vera Farmiga,
oozing casual charm). He convinces Vic to organize a no-brainer
boost of a vault, which, of course, doesn't go as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Connell, however, is too fond of his characters to truly dump on
them, which in truth makes for some pretty listless drama.
Likewise, he pads the movie with a lot of protracted establishing
shots and scenes of characters just walking, walking. And for all
the footage he uses in an airport, you'd think something would
actually transpire there, but no _ it just looks like he couldn't
believe his good luck to shoot in an airport on such a tight
budget. And Kurt Hoffman's music may be the most blandly obscure
score in years _ the music evokes nothing emotionally in the scenes
over which it plays, it just takes up space on the sound track.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing about ``The Opportunists'' that's poorly
rendered, it's just that, try as Walken and Connell may _ and
perhaps they try too off- handedly _ they can't generate much
empathy for Vic's plight. It makes low-key movies seem
over-caffeinated. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
-The film: ``The Opportunists'' (R; language). &QL;

Farmiga, Donal Logue. &QL;

ADVANCED MICRO RELEASING DETAILS OF NEW CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advanced Micro Devices Inc. plans to release
design details of its new 64-bit processor on Thursday, a chip that
is intended to compete with the Intel Corp.'s forthcoming Itanium.
Advanced Micro said it expected the chip to help it gain sales in
the workstation and server market.
</P>
<P>
   With the public distribution of an overview by Advanced Micro's
programmers, software developers can now begin modifying existing
applications or creating programs to run on the chip, which the
company expects to ship next year.
</P>
<P>
   Software applications that are expected to benefit from the
increased power of 64-bit computing include large databases;
digital content creation, computer-aided design; security and
encryption; Internet content delivery; simulations; weather
prediction and oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that is crucial to the company's strategy, the chip is
an extension of the so-called x86 architecture that is used in
Intel's Pentium family and in Advanced Micro's own Athlon; unlike
the Itanium, it is not an entirely new design. Advanced Micro says
this means that existing 32-bit applications will run on the chip
without modification and that writing 64-bit versions of those
applications will be a more straightforward process than it is on
the Intel product.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very different approach from our main competitor, who
is essentially defining an entirely new architecture that is not
compatible with existing programs,'' said Martin Booth, Advanced
Micro's product marketing manager for computer products. ``Our
approach makes the job a lot simpler. You get 64-bit performance
while remaining compatible with the existing 32-bit installed
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sullivan, an Intel spokesman, said the Itanium chip
would be compatible, even though it was not an extension of the x86
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Itanium processor is designed from the ground up for
advanced 64-bit server and workstation environments, 32-bit
software runs on the processor in silicon with no emulation
required,'' Sullivan said. Intel published the details of the
Itanium on May 26, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that there was some merit to Advanced Micro's
assertions of higher performance on existing applications, if no
way to prove them at this time, and that the company's strategy
made sense in light of Intel's market dominance. Although Advanced
Micro has made considerable gains in market share in the low and
middle end of the desktop PC market, it has only a tiny share in
workstations and servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a segment of the market that will find their
proposition appealing,'' said Drew Peck, an analyst with SG Cowen.
``On the other hand, AMD doesn't have much experience marketing to
the high end of the market,'' Peck said, noting that those
customers willing to use a non-Intel processor can already turn to
Sparc, made by Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is this market will be highly fragmented, so the total
opportunity is not huge,'' Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Leibson, editor in chief of the Microprocessor Report,
said that Advanced Micro was taking a practical approach, albeit
one more likely to gain sales in the PC market than in servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This backward compatibility stuff really only makes sense in
the desktop market, and I don't think it will affect price that
much,'' Leibson said. ``I think what they're doing is very
intelligently spotting an opportunity within Intel's strategy that
they can exploit.''

<P>
   Suggest the idea of a movie about Nazis and lesbians in
war-sundered Berlin, and you might first conjure up images of some
tastelessly campy item from the no-budget Troma catalog, or a lurid
wallow in self-loathing from Rainer Werner Fassbinder.
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget it _ ``Aimee &AMP; Jaguar'' is a stunningly layered and
humane film, based upon a true story, that deftly balances its twin
examinations, of the politics of both hatred and forbidden love, in
a surprisingly accessible fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Impeccably and vividly shot by Tony Imi with lots of saturated
colors, ``Aimee &AMP; Jaguar'' depicts the unlikely love affair between
a Jew and an anti-Semite who didn't know her lover's true identity,
between a woman who played both sides against the other as part of
her fierce, live-for- the-minute philosophy and one who was the
dully unfaithful wife of a German soldier and bored mother of four.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, outside their bedroom, outside the concert halls and
newspaper offices and tony dance clubs where they lived their
lives, bombs dropped obliviously, reducing their landscape to
rubble. The Nazis, inevitably, would do the same to their psychic
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Felice (Maria Schrader), who called herself ``Jaguar'' around
``Aimee,'' was a woman of many disguises. She worked at a Nazi-run
newspaper but more sincerely for the resistance; she first became
interested in ``Aimee'' when a friend who worked as her nanny told
her she had once claimed she could tell a Jew by their smell
(ostensibly, she wanted to see if it was true). Lilly (Juliane
Kohler), or ``Aimee,'' was a self-satisfied but scarcely
self-examining woman whose propensity for not considering the
consequences of her actions was adapted by her impetuous love; the
befogged decisions of both led to disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   What could account for these two getting together, for these two
who ordinarily would not have met to have immersed themselves in
one another so deeply? Certainly, the nihilistic romance of being
spoiled yet implicitly doomed in accursed Berlin contributed to the
passion with which the two tore into one another, and yet the film
digs tantalizingly deeper, seeking out something more. Director Max
Farberbock, who co-wrote the screenplay with Rona Munro, adapting
Erica Fischer's book, builds the events leading to their first
ill-fated clinch and their first halting, tremulous flight of
passion deliberately, mesmerizingly, inexorably.
</P>
<P>
   Farberbock crams a lot of story and sociology and psychology
into his film's two hours and change and gives the film an
uncommonly strong sense of time and place on what couldn't have
been a particularly impressive budget. Given how timid much German
cinema that lands Stateside is regarding the Holocaust, this
hard-edged, boldly scurrilous and scandalous look back at the
world's darkest hour represents something like blue sky for fellow
fatherland filmmakers, paving the way, one hopes, to further
adventurous examinations of their country's greatest shame.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader and Kohler, who shared the Best Actress Award at the
Berlin Film Festival (certainly, no one would want to pick one over
the other), are marvels, giving fearlessly assertive performances
and appearing alternately ridiculously glamorous and shockingly
bedraggled by their country's policies. ``Aimee &AMP; Jaguar'' is
easily one of the year's best films _ not that it's traveling with
a particularly fast pack at this point _ and certainly one of its
most original and visually flamboyant. It's smart, it evokes a
world both alien and exotic and, ultimately, it's genuinely
affecting. &QL;

examinations, of the politics of both hatred and forbidden love, in
a surprisingly accessible fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Impeccably and vividly shot by Tony Imi with lots of saturated
colors, ``Aimee &AMP; Jaguar'' depicts the unlikely love affair between
a Jew and an anti-Semite who didn't know her lover's true identity,
between a woman who played both sides against the other as part of
her fierce, live-for- the-minute philosophy and one who was the
dully unfaithful wife of a German soldier and bored mother of four.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, outside their bedroom, outside the concert halls and
newspaper offices and tony dance clubs where they lived their
lives, bombs dropped obliviously, reducing their landscape to
rubble. The Nazis, inevitably, would do the same to their psychic
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Felice (Maria Schrader), who called herself ``Jaguar'' around
``Aimee,'' was a woman of many disguises. She worked at a Nazi-run
newspaper but more sincerely for the resistance; she first became
interested in ``Aimee'' when a friend who worked as her nanny told
her she had once claimed she could tell a Jew by their smell
(ostensibly, she wanted to see if it was true). Lilly (Juliane
Kohler), or ``Aimee,'' was a self-satisfied but scarcely
self-examining woman whose propensity for not considering the
consequences of her actions was adapted by her impetuous love; the
befogged decisions of both led to disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   What could account for these two getting together, for these two
who ordinarily would not have met to have immersed themselves in
one another so deeply? Certainly, the nihilistic romance of being
spoiled yet implicitly doomed in accursed Berlin contributed to the
passion with which the two tore into one another, and yet the film
digs tantalizingly deeper, seeking out something more. Director Max
Farberbock, who co-wrote the screenplay with Rona Munro, adapting
Erica Fischer's book, builds the events leading to their first
ill-fated clinch and their first halting, tremulous flight of
passion deliberately, mesmerizingly, inexorably.
</P>
<P>
   Farberbock crams a lot of story and sociology and psychology
into his film's two hours and change and gives the film an
uncommonly strong sense of time and place on what couldn't have
been a particularly impressive budget. Given how timid much German
cinema that lands Stateside is regarding the Holocaust, this
hard-edged, boldly scurrilous and scandalous look back at the
world's darkest hour represents something like blue sky for fellow
fatherland filmmakers, paving the way, one hopes, to further
adventurous examinations of their country's greatest shame.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader and Kohler, who shared the Best Actress Award at the
Berlin Film Festival (certainly, no one would want to pick one over
the other), are marvels, giving fearlessly assertive performances
and appearing alternately ridiculously glamorous and shockingly
bedraggled by their country's policies. ``Aimee &AMP; Jaguar'' is
easily one of the year's best films _ not that it's traveling with
a particularly fast pack at this point _ and certainly one of its
most original and visually flamboyant. It's smart, it evokes a
world both alien and exotic and, ultimately, it's genuinely
affecting. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Portending a possible role for DNA beyond biology,
researchers at Bell Laboratories and Oxford University have
fashioned molecular-sized motors out of the chemical that stores
the genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA motors resemble tweezers that are so small they could
potentially pick up a single atom, with 13 trillion of the motors
fitting into a drop of water. The molecular tweezers are opened and
closed by other DNA that serves as ``fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   The development is part of an effort, still in its infancy, to
harness DNA as a structural and electronic material that might one
day be used to make ultra-tiny computers or mechanical devices,
like a robot that could cruise through the bloodstream to repair an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know DNA is not used this way in the body,'' said
Bernard Yurke, a physicist at Bell Labs who led the work, described
in Thursday's issue of Nature. ``We're using DNA in very
non-biological way, as a structural material and as a fuel in some
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   DNA could be attractive for such molecular construction because
a strand of DNA will stick only to another strand with a
corresponding sequence of bases, the chemical units that form the
genetic code. So DNA strands in solution could automatically
assemble themselves into a structure. ``Think of it as a smart
glue,'' Yurke said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the DNA tweezers might one day be used to pick up
particular ions for molecular construction or to provide motion to
a tiny machine. But Bell Labs, which is in Murray Hill, N.J., and
is part of Lucent Technologies, is more interested in computing.
For that the tweezers are not of direct interest but do demonstrate
the idea of self-assembly. In the future it might be possible to
attach electronic components to DNA and have the DNA strands link
to form a computer with far more speed and information storage
capacity than exists today, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nadrian C. Seeman, a professor of chemistry at New York
University, has used DNA to make three-dimensional ``stick
figures'' like cubes and also a mechanical switch that flips
between two positions when a chemical is added to solution. Nanogen
Inc., a biotechnology company in San Diego, received a patent this
year for a method of using DNA connected to fluorescent dyes to
make an optical memory that could potentially hold far more
information in a given space than a compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say it will be 10 years and possibly much longer
before practical devices could be made out of DNA. And some experts
said other chemicals might prove more useful than DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be cute little laboratory experiments,'' James
M. Tour, professor of chemistry and a molecular electronics
researcher at Rice University, said of work using DNA. ``I'm not
sure how viable it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem, Tour said, is that DNA works best in solution, not
solid form. DNA also does not conduct electricity well, limiting
its direct use in electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   DNA is nature's method of storing huge amounts of information in
a tiny space. The space between each letter in the genetic code is
0.34 nanometer, or billionth of a meter. Existing electronics
technology makes features about 100 nanometers in size, more than
100 times as large.
</P>
<P>
   For several years scientists have been experimenting with using
DNA directly for computation. A problem to be solved can be encoded
in a sequence of bases. The DNA is then put into a test tube and
the DNA strands match up in a way that produces a strand encoding
the solution.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say such chemical computers will be slower and
more cumbersome than electronic ones. So Yurke and others are
looking at using DNA more as a scaffolding to build electronic
computers.
</P>
<P>
   DNA is a double helix, a twisted ladder with each rung made of
two of the four bases in the genetic code. The base represented by
the letter A always pairs with T, and C with G, so when the ladder
is split down the middle, each half will bind only with another
half that has the complementary sequence of bases.
</P>
<P>
   To molecular tweezers are made by putting three specific strands
of DNA into a test tube. The strands stick together to form two
stiff double-stranded arms connected by a short single strand that
acts as a hinge. A single strand dangles off the end of each arm.
</P>
<P>
   To close the tweezers, a single strand of DNA that is
complementary to both dangling ends is put into solution. This
``fuel'' DNA binds to those ends and pulls them together, almost
like tying a shoe. To open the hinge, a strand complementary to the
fuel strand is put into the solution. It eventually out-competes
the tweezers' arms to bind to the fuel DNA. This double-stranded
``waste'' product floats away, like the exhaust from an engine.
</P>
<P>
   Others taking part in the work were Andrew J. Turberfield, a
physicist at Oxford; Allen P. Mills Jr. and Friedrich C. Simmel of
Bell Labs; and Jennifer Neumann, a graduate student at Rutgers
University.

RAGING WATERS
</HEADLINE>
  `Demented' director back to early form 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movie fans who have found themselves stranded in the middle of
an artistically listless summer may appreciate the sentiment behind
John Waters' latest assault on gentility, ``Cecil B. Demented.''
</P>
<P>
   It concerns a renegade filmmaker (Stephen Dorff) who _ when not
shouting such aphorisms as ``Punish bad cinema!'' _ kidnaps Honey
Whitlock (Melanie Griffith), a frivolous, spoiled movie star and
forces her to work (and for less than scale, at that!) in his
rambling assault on the empty moviemaking machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, not only is she defacing a theater showing the director's
cut of ``Patch Adams'' and shooting (with guns) at those shooting
(with cameras) an even sappier sequel to ``Forrest Gump,'' she's
kind of enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   And who wouldn't? Waters defined shock cinema in the '70s with
such brazenly cheesy classics as ``Pink Flamingos,'' ``Desperate
Living'' and ``Female Trouble'' before entering the movie
mainstream with camp favorites ``Hairspray'' and ``Polyester''
before offering such light-hearted fare as the romantic comedy
``Pecker'' and the sitcom spoof ``Serial Mom.'' (Even at his most
demented, he's been a movie buff _ he's written down the title and
his own rating for every movie he's seen since he was 16.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. Demented'' marks something of a return to form: As
co-star Patricia Hearst notes, it's his ``most mean-spirited'' film
in quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, a frequent co-star in Waters' films, adds that the
director remains in touch with his early days of renegade
filmmaking. ``On the set of 'Cry-Baby,''' she recalls, ``he came in
and said to Mink Stole (another Waters regular), 'Do you recognize
this location? It's where we were detained and had to go to court
for filming a nude scene without permission!' There is a
wistfulness about his past, but in his mind, the thing that's
changed the most is money. He says he used to spend a thousand
dollars a day; now he'll laugh and say his movie is costing a
thousand dollars an hour or a thousand dollars a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Most filmmakers might think twice about asking Patricia Hearst _
who was involved in a bit of unpleasant business in the '70s;
perhaps you heard about it _ to be in a movie about kidnappers who
attempt to brainwash their subject, but Hearst just laughed. ``I
called him after I read the script and said, 'You're a very sick
man,' which he took as high praise indeed. I thought it was
hilarious, so naughty, and I loved its take on Stockholm
Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Waters says of Hearst, ``I think she hates the
(Symbionese Liberation Army), she hates the cops who put her in
jail _ who's she supposed to like in that situation? She made all
the right decisions _ every single thing she did was the right
decision because she's alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   For his latest film, Waters looked to his twin passions, film
and terrorism. ``I've got two shelves of those books, on leftist
terrorists, on right-wing terrorist, every kind of terrorist, and
I've read every one of them. I had great fun going to riots as a
teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   So Waters sat down to discuss terrorism and riots and
underground movies in the comfortably posh bosom of pampered
Hollywood, the Mondrian Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A fan of riots, eh? You sticking around for the Democratic
National Convention?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is the only city where I'm scared of the police. If I'm
going to be at a riot, I want to be in Philadelphia (home of the
Republican convention). It'd be a better riot. Although there's
better weather here. But you get out of jail quicker in
Philadelphia _ it's closer to New York, and there are more A.C.L.U.
representatives nearby to help you. Here, you go to jail, and you
stay _ it's hard to get out of jail here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are your favorite terrorists?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Weathermen were, then, the most defiant, because they had
the Days of Rage where they'd just cause trouble. They did really
politically incorrect things back then. All the '60s radicals who
are free today just run day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And who do you consider the most pathetic terrorists?
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughing) The anti-abortionist terrorists who dress as
babies are pretty pathetic, though I like to read about them _ they
sit there with their thumbs in their mouths and go, 'Waaah!
Waaaah!' They turn to the cameraman and say, 'Aaah! Daddy! No!'
That shocked me, when I first read about them; their movement is
called Adult Babies Against Abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The art direction of the old theater where Cecil hides out is
reminiscent of the look of your '70s movies.
</P>
<P>
   A: It looks a little like my old apartment, actually. I just
love abandoned theaters, but I hate it when they take the marquees
down. When the marquees are up, the more damaged they get, the
better they look. Or when they lose their letters _ when they start
out reading, 'For Rent,' then, 'F-r -ent' until finally, 'F-r
---t.'
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore still has one drive-in theater, which just shows
family movies _ of course, it used to show just gore _ and it only
has one porno theater, which just goes to show how much the city of
Baltimore cares about people who don't have VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Each of Cecil's disciples sports a tattoo naming a maverick
filmmaker. Were there any directors you wanted to name but didn't?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cecil likes [Pier Paolo] Pasolini film festivals, which most
young kids aren't clamoring for. He's a traditionalist to the point
of terrorism, and he wants kids not to forget these people. That
part of his character is definitely me. Although I think it's a
great time for young filmmakers, but I didn't want to add any until
they've made more movies. Todd Haynes (``Safe'') and Todd Solondz
(``Happiness'') are great.
</P>
<P>
   All the studios are looking for these people these days. When I
started, no one was looking for that. No one said my films were
good, ever. It took a long time before we were accepted, but it was
a different time. There was a cultural war. The audiences that made
those films successful wouldn't have wanted the regular critics to
like them. Regular critics were square. There's no such thing today
_ every critic is hip. There's no such thing as a critic who
doesn't think he's with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your take on directors' cuts is inspired.
</P>
<P>
   A: All movies are too long. All my movies are the same running _
they're all 90 minutes. That's from my old 16-mm days _ three
reels, a half-hour each. A beginning, middle and end. That's a
story, isn't it? No arcs here _ it starts, something happens and it
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what were you doing, watching ``Patch Adams'' (whose
``director's cut'' Honey decries) in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   A: I never saw it until I wrote the movie and I had to parody
it. I secretly respect 'Patch Adams' _ it is a terrorist movie
against my world. I would like to get a 'Patch Adams' tattoo or
just have, in my office, that poster. People coming in would look
at it and wonder what the hell my problem was.
</P>
<P>
   So I didn't watch it until I was writing this movie. To imagine
having cancer and being in the hospital and having someone wacky
like Patch come into the room _ that would be really reason to get
off for murder. Any jury would acquit you. So I was fascinated by
it. And now I want to go to a theater and shout out the lines,
dressed as Patch Adams, until the police take me away to a mental
institute. I've changed my opinion _ 'Patch Adams' is a movie that
will never, ever be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What other films do you consider ``terrorist movies'' against
your sensibility?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm better at praising things that I like. As soon as I say a
negative thing, I come to L.A. and go to a dinner party and look at
a place card and (the filmmakers) are sitting next to me. I learned
that long ago. (``Forrest Gump'' director) Bob Zemeckis can take it
_ he does big, hit movies that won the Oscar and made a billion
dollars. That's a safe movie to pick on.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to call the police when Forrest Gump started running,
the same way people called the police when Divine ate the dog(poop)
(in ``Pink Flamingos''). There is no censor for me to call. If I
called the police and said, 'I just saw a movie that is offensive
to my community's standards,' which 'Forrest Gump' would be _
they'd say, 'Tough.' There are all sorts of community standards on
both sides of the coin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What accounted for that weird little sounds during the sex
scene we hear in the movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: The brilliant sound editors of Fantasy Studios (led by Rick
Angelella). They had such disgusting noises. One of his employees
came up for a sound for the gerbils that was so rude and lasted so
long _ they had really worked on this one _ it was a masterpiece of
repulsion. It had many layers. It would've gotten beyond an NC-17.
It was great. I said, 'Oh, my God.' She (the employee) now has a
T-shirt that reads, 'I grossed out John Waters.' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   STRAFFORD, Vt. _ College life in the 1950s was once described as
the bland leading the bland. Certainly on every campus there were
professors with disquieting thoughts and more than a handful of
students who worried about the world's future as much as their own.
But most students in the '50s considered their education more for
gain than for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the '60s. At Yale, where I served as chaplain and
where three of this year's presidential and vice presidential
candidates were students (Joseph Lieberman arrived in 1960, George
W. Bush in 1964, and Dick Cheney was there briefly early in the
decade), a strong social consciousness was emerging. The 1955 bus
boycott by blacks in Montgomery, Ala., had put that city on the
moral map, and in 1960 I invited the movement's leader, Martin
Luther King Jr., to speak in the Yale chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The church was packed. King emphasized social, not personal,
morality. Quoting Paul Tillich, he declared, ``Since the law cannot
be wholly internalized in the conscience of imperfect human beings,
conscience must be externalized into law.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of students were still hanging around my house when I
returned from taking King to the railroad station. Said one, ``That
man makes us blacks proud to be black,'' to which a Southern white
quickly added, ``and us whites proud to be human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the '60s Yale students and a few faculty and chaplains
helped integrate buses, motels, lunch counters, parks, pools and
housing in New Haven. In the summer of '64, many students joined
voter registration drives in Alabama and Mississippi. Urging them
on was the editor of The Yale Daily News, Joe Lieberman, who in
October 1963 was himself a civil rights worker in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   I thought highly and was very fond of Joe. For him Judaism
represented a world view undergirding progressive thought and
action. It was a view widely shared by many religious groups at
Yale. His being a Jew and editor of The News was less a
breakthrough than a validation of the fact that anti-Semitism was
receding.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, the Peace Corps attracted many Yale
students. Students began seeking careers reflecting John Ruskin's
thought that the primary reward for human toil is not what you get
for it but what you become by it. The college became far more
diverse: many more Jews, African-Americans and foreign students
were admitted, and finally in 1969 Yale became co-ed.
</P>
<P>
   Fraternities lost popularity as many students agreed with E.B.
White that ``the opposite of fraternities is fraternity.''
Teach-ins and demonstrations opposing the Vietnam War were jammed _
addressed by John Hersey and Arthur Miller, among others. On Oct.
16, 1967, draft cards were turned in around the country in protest
and then handed over to the Justice Department in Washington. The
largest number from any one college came from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   I am sorry to say that during these years I knew only Lieberman,
neither Bush nor Cheney. It is also important to note that in all
these activities only a minority played active roles. But a
prophetic minority always has more to say than any majority,
``moral'' or ``silent.''
</P>
<P>
   I am sure Bush is right in criticizing the self-righteousness of
many of us in the anti-war movement at Yale. It is hard to fight
national self-righteousness without personal self-righteousness.
But it is also sad not to share in the action and passion of your
time. Often called a decade of student unrest, the '60s would be
better termed a time of ethical unrest, a time that I hope will
soon come again to disrupt our present complacency.

1958 to 1976.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Ralph Nader is my friend and hero, but his
Green Party candidacy for the presidency could torpedo efforts to
address the nation's most important environmental challenges. The
threat, of course, is that Nader's candidacy could siphon votes
from Al Gore, the environment's most visible champion since
Theodore Roosevelt, and lead to the election of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Nader dismisses his spoiler role by arguing that there is little
distinction between the major parties' candidates and that Gore has
compromised on too many issues. While I admire Nader's high-minded
ideals, his suggestion that there is no difference between Gore and
Bush is irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   On the environment, the difference is fundamental. It reaches
deep into their philosophies and records, showing most recently in
their choice of running mates: Dick Cheney's anti-environmental
votes in Congress extended even to opposing the Clean Water Act,
while Joe Lieberman has staunchly supported strong environmental
legislation and even written it.
</P>
<P>
   While environmentalists have had their disappointments with the
Clinton administration, they need to keep their perspective. Gore,
more than anyone else, deserves credit for rallying
conservationists and fortifying President Clinton to repulse the
efforts of the Gingrich Congress to eviscerate 30 years of
environmental law. He helped persuade Clinton to protect the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in a standoff that led to the shutdown of
the government. It was a risky gambit that, unpredictably, also
paid off politically.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has fought for tough clean air rules, secured more
financing for programs like research on energy conservation and
successfully promoted a long list of measures to preserve
diminishing wild areas.
</P>
<P>
   He has risked heavy criticism for his support of the Kyoto
agreement to limit global warming, and his book ``Earth in the
Balance'' is an ambitious blueprint for the environmental movement.
For his efforts, Gore has earned the enmity of the polluters and
their political spokesmen, including Bush and his father, who
christened Gore ``Ozone Man'' to ridicule his concern for clean
air.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, by contrast, has a famously abysmal environmental
record, made all the more objectionable by his attempts to deny it.
His appointees to Texas environmental agencies come from the
chemical and oil industries. He has allowed Texas' biggest
polluters, his contributors, to write environmental laws that make
compliance voluntary. Texas under his leadership is 49th in the
nation in per capita environmental spending. In a change that
seemed impossible just five years ago, Houston has now surpassed
long-suffering Los Angeles as the smoggiest city. Texas now claims
the country's highest levels of air and water pollution and toxic
releases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has promised to hand over the Arctic Refuge to the oil
industry, dilute the Clean Water and Clean Air acts, and lift
protections on public lands and our national forests. With popular
clean air programs already under assault from conservative judicial
activists, Bush praises the anti-environmental decisions of
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Whatever his litmus
test for court appointments, it almost certainly won't include a
positive record on the environment. And Bush favors the current
system of campaign finance, which puts inordinate power in the
hands of polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Nader has said that, if forced to choose, he would
vote for Bush _ presumably as more likely to cause a backlash in
the environment's favor. In fact, a vote for Nader is a vote for
Bush, and environmentalists who join his personal crusade risk
marginalizing the conservation movement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's eight years as vice president have mainly tested his
loyalty. As president, he will at last have the opportunity to
carry out his own environmental vision.
</P>
<P>
   (Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the president of the Water Keeper
Alliance and a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council.)

  `Demented' director back to early form 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movie fans who have found themselves stranded in the middle of
an artistically listless summer may appreciate the sentiment behind
John Waters' latest assault on gentility, ``Cecil B. Demented.''
</P>
<P>
   It concerns a renegade filmmaker (Stephen Dorff) who _ when not
shouting such aphorisms as ``Punish bad cinema!'' _ kidnaps Honey
Whitlock (Melanie Griffith), a frivolous, spoiled movie star and
forces her to work (and for less than scale, at that!) in his
rambling assault on the empty moviemaking machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, not only is she defacing a theater showing the director's
cut of ``Patch Adams'' and shooting (with guns) at those shooting
(with cameras) an even sappier sequel to ``Forrest Gump,'' she's
kind of enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   And who wouldn't? Waters defined shock cinema in the '70s with
such brazenly cheesy classics as ``Pink Flamingos,'' ``Desperate
Living'' and ``Female Trouble'' before entering the movie
mainstream with camp favorites ``Hairspray'' and ``Polyester''
before offering such light-hearted fare as the romantic comedy
``Pecker'' and the sitcom spoof ``Serial Mom.'' (Even at his most
demented, he's been a movie buff _ he's written down the title and
his own rating for every movie he's seen since he was 16.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. Demented'' marks something of a return to form: As
co-star Patricia Hearst notes, it's his ``most mean-spirited'' film
in quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, a frequent co-star in Waters' films, adds that the
director remains in touch with his early days of renegade
filmmaking. ``On the set of 'Cry-Baby,''' she recalls, ``he came in
and said to Mink Stole (another Waters regular), 'Do you recognize
this location? It's where we were detained and had to go to court
for filming a nude scene without permission!' There is a
wistfulness about his past, but in his mind, the thing that's
changed the most is money. He says he used to spend a thousand
dollars a day; now he'll laugh and say his movie is costing a
thousand dollars an hour or a thousand dollars a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Most filmmakers might think twice about asking Patricia Hearst _
who was involved in a bit of unpleasant business in the '70s;
perhaps you heard about it _ to be in a movie about kidnappers who
attempt to brainwash their subject, but Hearst just laughed. ``I
called him after I read the script and said, 'You're a very sick
man,' which he took as high praise indeed. I thought it was
hilarious, so naughty, and I loved its take on Stockholm
Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Waters says of Hearst, ``I think she hates the
(Symbionese Liberation Army), she hates the cops who put her in
jail _ who's she supposed to like in that situation? She made all
the right decisions _ every single thing she did was the right
decision because she's alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   For his latest film, Waters looked to his twin passions, film
and terrorism. ``I've got two shelves of those books, on leftist
terrorists, on right-wing terrorist, every kind of terrorist, and
I've read every one of them. I had great fun going to riots as a
teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   So Waters sat down to discuss terrorism and riots and
underground movies in the comfortably posh bosom of pampered
Hollywood, the Mondrian Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A fan of riots, eh? You sticking around for the Democratic
National Convention?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is the only city where I'm scared of the police. If I'm
going to be at a riot, I want to be in Philadelphia (home of the
Republican convention). It'd be a better riot. Although there's
better weather here. But you get out of jail quicker in
Philadelphia _ it's closer to New York, and there are more A.C.L.U.
representatives nearby to help you. Here, you go to jail, and you
stay _ it's hard to get out of jail here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are your favorite terrorists?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Weathermen were, then, the most defiant, because they had
the Days of Rage where they'd just cause trouble. They did really
politically incorrect things back then. All the '60s radicals who
are free today just run day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And who do you consider the most pathetic terrorists?
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughing) The anti-abortionist terrorists who dress as
babies are pretty pathetic, though I like to read about them _ they
sit there with their thumbs in their mouths and go, 'Waaah!
Waaaah!' They turn to the cameraman and say, 'Aaah! Daddy! No!'
That shocked me, when I first read about them; their movement is
called Adult Babies Against Abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The art direction of the old theater where Cecil hides out is
reminiscent of the look of your '70s movies.
</P>
<P>
   A: It looks a little like my old apartment, actually. I just
love abandoned theaters, but I hate it when they take the marquees
down. When the marquees are up, the more damaged they get, the
better they look. Or when they lose their letters _ when they start
out reading, 'For Rent,' then, 'F-r -ent' until finally, 'F-r
---t.'
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore still has one drive-in theater, which just shows
family movies _ of course, it used to show just gore _ and it only
has one porno theater, which just goes to show how much the city of
Baltimore cares about people who don't have VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Each of Cecil's disciples sports a tattoo naming a maverick
filmmaker. Were there any directors you wanted to name but didn't?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cecil likes [Pier Paolo] Pasolini film festivals, which most
young kids aren't clamoring for. He's a traditionalist to the point
of terrorism, and he wants kids not to forget these people. That
part of his character is definitely me. Although I think it's a
great time for young filmmakers, but I didn't want to add any until
they've made more movies. Todd Haynes (``Safe'') and Todd Solondz
(``Happiness'') are great.
</P>
<P>
   All the studios are looking for these people these days. When I
started, no one was looking for that. No one said my films were
good, ever. It took a long time before we were accepted, but it was
a different time. There was a cultural war. The audiences that made
those films successful wouldn't have wanted the regular critics to
like them. Regular critics were square. There's no such thing today
_ every critic is hip. There's no such thing as a critic who
doesn't think he's with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your take on directors' cuts is inspired.
</P>
<P>
   A: All movies are too long. All my movies are the same running _
they're all 90 minutes. That's from my old 16-mm days _ three
reels, a half-hour each. A beginning, middle and end. That's a
story, isn't it? No arcs here _ it starts, something happens and it
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what were you doing, watching ``Patch Adams'' (whose
``director's cut'' Honey decries) in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   A: I never saw it until I wrote the movie and I had to parody
it. I secretly respect 'Patch Adams' _ it is a terrorist movie
against my world. I would like to get a 'Patch Adams' tattoo or
just have, in my office, that poster. People coming in would look
at it and wonder what the hell my problem was.
</P>
<P>
   So I didn't watch it until I was writing this movie. To imagine
having cancer and being in the hospital and having someone wacky
like Patch come into the room _ that would be really reason to get
off for murder. Any jury would acquit you. So I was fascinated by
it. And now I want to go to a theater and shout out the lines,
dressed as Patch Adams, until the police take me away to a mental
institute. I've changed my opinion _ 'Patch Adams' is a movie that
will never, ever be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What other films do you consider ``terrorist movies'' against
your sensibility?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm better at praising things that I like. As soon as I say a
negative thing, I come to L.A. and go to a dinner party and look at
a place card and (the filmmakers) are sitting next to me. I learned
that long ago. (``Forrest Gump'' director) Bob Zemeckis can take it
_ he does big, hit movies that won the Oscar and made a billion
dollars. That's a safe movie to pick on.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to call the police when Forrest Gump started running,
the same way people called the police when Divine ate the dog(poop)
(in ``Pink Flamingos''). There is no censor for me to call. If I
called the police and said, 'I just saw a movie that is offensive
to my community's standards,' which 'Forrest Gump' would be _
they'd say, 'Tough.' There are all sorts of community standards on
both sides of the coin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What accounted for that weird little sounds during the sex
scene we hear in the movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: The brilliant sound editors of Fantasy Studios (led by Rick
Angelella). They had such disgusting noises. One of his employees
came up for a sound for the gerbils that was so rude and lasted so
long _ they had really worked on this one _ it was a masterpiece of
repulsion. It had many layers. It would've gotten beyond an NC-17.
It was great. I said, 'Oh, my God.' She (the employee) now has a
T-shirt that reads, 'I grossed out John Waters.' &QL;

If you're going to hang around this town, write screenplays and a
Tinseltown-tweaking novel called ``The Deal,'' _ as Peter Lefcourt
has _ you probably should know when to use the fork on your arugula
salad and when to use it on the hard-balling producer seated across
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter/playwright Lefcourt knows from deals and deal
making. Having been on the giving and receiving end of more than a
few pitch meetings, he's had a well known actress tell him, with
refreshing directness, ``I'm the star and I need more lines.'' On
another occasion, while pitching a cop show, Lefcourt had a
producer inform him, ``I don't hear any lights and sirens.''
(That's producer speak for ``Don't call us.'')
</P>
<P>
   Has he been involved in the type of meetings depicted in his
1992 play, ``La Ronde de Lunch''? ``Too many times,'' said
Lefcourt.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-scene spoof on the ways that Hollywood wines, dines and
feeds its deal makers, ``La Ronde de Lunch 2000'' is a spin on the
same Arthur Schnitzler play that got Nicole Kidman to drop her
knickers on Broadway. The production concludes the inaugural season
at the El Portal Circle Theater in NoHo. It opens Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated with how business in Hollywood is transacted,''
says Lefcourt, a novelist and the executive producer/co-creator of
``Beggars and Choosers'' on Showtime. ``I think this town functions
on the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   His play certainly does. ``La Ronde de Lunch.'' It chronicles 10
deal- making encounters _ some movie related, others not _ at the
same trendy Melrose Avenue bistro. Admit it, Hollywood, you know
the drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all live on this shifting Navajo sand painting. There's no
job security and there's this need to promote yourself,'' Lefcourt
said. ``If you're waiting around for the phone to ring, it's
probably not going to happen. Unless you're David Mamet.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor's Alley _ El Portal's resident company _ first produced
``La Ronde de Lunch'' in 1992 at a different location. Jeremiah
Morris who has directed three of the four Lefcourt plays to be
produced by Actor's Alley, suggested that the playwright revisit
``La Ronde de Lunch'' to close the first season of the smaller
Circle Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Done, said Lefcourt who quickly realized the play _ which hadn't
been staged since ots original 1992 production _ wouldn't require a
major overhaul. Even though Tinseltown moves at warp speed, the
only real updates needed were names, jokes and the position of
paycheck decimal points. References to Mel Gibson earning, say,
$1-$2 million per picture have been changed to Leonardo DiCaprio
pulling in $10-$20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the matter of cell phones which are a lot more
common now than in the early 90s. Plot points involved characters
getting an important call mid-scene and having a waiter bringing a
phone to the table, but there would be no way a power lunching duo
could pass an entirely ring free hour in a star-strewn bistro.
</P>
<P>
   Unless...
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest way to do it was to have the owner of the
restaurant ban cell phones from the restaurant because he doesn't
like them,'' said Lefcourt. ``So we've got a sign with a cell phone
and a line through it.''
</P>
<P>
   For those unfamiliar with the format of ``La Ronde,'' imagine a
perfect circle. Character A holds a deal meeting with character B.
In the second scene, Character B is holding a different deal
meeting with C _ albeit from a different position of power. Eight
scenes later, the action has worked its way back around so that the
final character, J, is once again meeting with character A, thereby
completing the circle.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Lunch's'' encounters, an actress who has seen better days
chats up a high-powered producer about a movie role. Next scene,
the producer, no longer as prosperous, is pitching a studio
executive. Then the studio executive has a house to sell. And the
carousel spins onward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schnitzler's `La Ronde' is supposed to be about venereal
disease, about love,'' adds Lefcourt ``I thought it would be
interesting to do the Hollywood version of the deal. All of these
tentacles of the same deal with different permutations as people
take them and twist them, and at each particular lunch, someone
would have the upper hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a world where well-constructed plays are sort of
pooh- poohed,'' adds Morris, El Portal's artistic director who will
direct two of the actors from the 1992 production this time around.
``Plays need a beginning, a middle and an end no matter what the
story in order to be an entity. It's very clear and intriguing to
start something, follow that circle and take it to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnitzler's 1900 play has been adapted numerous times into film
_ most famously the 1951 version directed by Max Ophuls. Two years
ago, British playwright David Hare adapted ``La Ronde'' into ``The
Blue Room'' a two character exercise chronicling a circular series
of sexual encounters that starred Nicole Kidman and Iain Glenn. (A
Schnitzler novel was also the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick's
final film, ``Eyes Wide Shut.'')
</P>
<P>
   Lefcourt's exercise in circularity is more farcical. It features
a 15 member cast including five waiters all named Bruce who act as
a kind of Greek chorus. In the process, show biz types, lawyers,
realtors all get their comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   So with all that going on, who needs a nude Nicole?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is outrageous enough,'' agrees Lefcourt.

 &HT;    Coke may face probe in Mexico
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola is about to face another regulatory problem
in Mexico _ one of its most important markets.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's antitrust agency has reportedly found indications of
monopolistic practices by the Atlanta-based beverage giant. The
country's Federal Competition Commission will notify the company by
Friday, according to El Financiero/Infolatina.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola would then have to respond to the preliminary probe. A
more detailed investigation could follow.
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Ben Deutsch said he could not comment because the
company has not seen details of the competition commission's
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the competition commission decides to proceed with an
investigation of the way Coca-Cola goes to market, it will look
into its sales practices, promotions, rebates and discounts to the
retail trade,'' said Andrew Conway, an analyst with Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said Pepsico and other competitors have complained about
Coke's selling practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke's actions contradict their words,'' said Pepsi spokesman
Larry Jabbonsky. ``Saying they'll play by the house rules and
actually playing by them are two very different things. Talk is
cheap. Unlawful, monopolistic activity is not. It stifles
competition and restricts retailer and consumer choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway said Pepsico and other competitors ``may attempt to keep
Coke focused on regulators, rather than building brands. But under
(Chairman) Doug Daft's new strategy, Coca-Cola will work diligently
with regulators to try to come to a workable solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke has faced similar concerns in the past, and they have
hindered acquisitions in Europe, Australia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   On July 26, Coke announced it was abandoning attempts to buy
Cadbury Schweppes' beverages in Mexico and Canada after failing to
overcome regulatory concerns. But on Aug. 1, Jabbonsky said, Coke
appealed a Mexican court's decision about the Cadbury deal to the
country's supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, Coke's actions don't line up with their words,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch, the Coke spokesman, said Jabbonsky was ``grossly
mistaken in his attempt to mislead the public. This appeal has
absolutely nothing to do with the acquisition of the Cadbury
Schweppes brands now or in the future. We decided not to pursue the
acquisition out of respect for competition concerns by the
regulatory authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Deutsch said, the company is appealing certain
``procedural conclusions'' by the regulatory authorities that could
affect its operations in the future.

   MEISSNER (Phoenix) - INS boss Doris Meissner admits that
``mistakes have been made'' with the INS's strategy to try to bolt
down the Mexican border by squeezing illegal traffic into Arizona
from California and Texas, then from the urban ports of entry to
the inhospitable desert. She believes the five-year-old policy has
generally been a success, but officials were wrong in believing
that ``geography would be their ally'' and deter border crossers
trying to make it through the desert. She also admits that
resources now being used to rescue stranded crossers may not be

PROZAC RULING HITS SHARES OF SEPRACOR, ELI LILLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Sepracor Inc. and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.
plummeted Wednesday after a federal appeals court overturned a
lower court ruling in a decision that paves the way for generic
versions of Prozac to be in drugstores within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor has licensed to Lilly a variation of Prozac that is
believed to have fewer side effects. The Marlborough, Mass. company
saw its stock drop 23.375 to $104.50. Trading in Lilly shares were
halted after dropping 33.4375 points to $75.125.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to Lilly's patent on Prozac, a controversial but
hugely popular antidepressant, was brought by generic drug
manufacturer Barr Laboratories Inc., which saw its stock nearly
double on the victory, rising 31.3125 to $77.75.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which is potentially good news for consumers,
delivers a significant blow to Lilly. Prozac had 1999 sales of $2.6
billion, accounting for a quarter of its sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly officials said they would appeal the decision, but some
legal analysts said it is extremely rare for the US Supreme Court
to hear a patent case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, to the extent that Barr prevails, generic Prozac will
be on the market sooner than previously thought,'' said David P.
Southwell, executive vice president and chief financial officer of
Sepracor.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly officials said the soonest generics could be on the market
would be August 2001, but Barr officials said generic Prozac could
be out by February.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the ruling, Lilly believed it had patent protection on
Prozac until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor's R-fluoxetine is currently in the latter stages of
phase two trials conducted by Lilly, and the soonest it could be
marketed is in 2002, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwell said the ruling does not affect Sepracor ``because the
product we licensed to Eli Lilly has a greater material efficacy
and fewer side effects against Prozac and other antidepressants. .
. . Clearly, we think we have a better drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said a generic on the market before
R-fluoxetine will make it more difficult for the new drug to gain
market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers might be swayed to generics, especially if generics
are out ahead of time and consumers have the chance to get
comfortable with them before the Sepracor drug is approved,''
analyst Robert Parente with Leerink Swann &AMP; Co. told Bloomberg
News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we are disappointed with the appellate court's ruling
and I have instructed our attorneys to appeal the decision,'' said
Sidney Taurel, Lilly chairman, president, and chief executive in a
statement. ``Going forward, we have developed a detailed plan of
action through which Lilly will continue to deliver innovative
products and earnings growth performance, even if we experience the
loss of this patent.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles E. Golden, Lilly's chief financial officer, said the
company expects to see earnings decline in the second half of 2001
and the first half of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share growth had been 18 percent between 1998 and
1999, and the company expects only single-digit earnings-per-share
growth in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, continued strong underlying growth of our current
newer products, coupled with the expected launches of a number of
new products and indications in 2001 and 2002, will lead to a
return to earnings growth in the second half of 2002,'' Golden said
in a statement.

BUSH, MCCAIN BEGIN BATTLE FOR CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ Defiantly rejecting conventional wisdom about
his prospects here, George W. Bush came to California Wednesday to
stake his claim on unfriendly territory, visiting a mostly
Democratic district less than an hour from the site of the
Democratic Convention next week.
</P>
<P>
   But the visit, designed to ``send a message'' to Vice President
Al Gore, was more an attention getting gesture than a real attempt
to raid Gore's base. If there is a real struggle for California _
and political analysts think there may be for the first time since
1988 _ it begins Thursday when Senator John S. McCain joins the
Bush caravan for the first time since their bitter California
primary fight.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope McCain, who once lured hundreds of thousands of
voters from other political parties in California, will help
transform what has for more than a decade been a losing battle for
the GOP. Republicans were defeated here the last two presidential
cycles. Both US senators are liberal Democrats. The highest ranking
Republican official is the Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides insist the Texas governor could win here in his own
right, appealing to Hispanic voters as he has in his own state and
presenting the moderate face that emerged from the Republican
convention last week. But with 54 electoral votes at stake, and
with fond memories of a winning streak that lasted from 1960 to
1988, Republicans are placing unusual emphasis on McCain to appeal
to centrist Democrats and Independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Senator McCain will help Governor Bush reach out to
independents and swing voters,'' Bush communications director Karen
Hughes said. ``We are obviously saying that we think California is
a state we can win, and we don't want the Democrats to have free
reign with publicity for their convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible incentive for the trip: Bush plans to raise up
to $400,000 at a fundraiser at the Stockton home of Alex Spanos,
owner of the San Diego Chargers footall team. He is attending
another fundraiser in Seattle Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Only five months have passed since McCain and Bush waged fierce
warfare during the California primary, which pitted all four
Republican and Democratic candidates against each other on the same
ballot. During an especially contentious stage, McCain was the
target of a negative advertising campaign in San Francisco that
attacked his environmental record and was paid for by a prominent
Texas Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, California helped seal McCain's fate. The Arizona
senator had hoped to win the so-called ``beauty contest'' to give
his campaign a symbolic boost, but he ended up in third place,
pulling in just 23 percent of the vote. Bush won the vast majority
of Republicans, with 60 percent, and a week later McCain dropped
out of the race. At the time, Bush heralded his victory as proof of
the power of the party faithful, who had chosen him to ``lead the
Republican Party'' to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Democrats preparing to use California as a
launching pad to retaining the White House, Bush officials are
reinterpreting those California primary results _ and reshaping
their image to present a candidate who is directly allied with
McCain. Instead of noting that Gore came in first place in
California, winning 34 percent of the total vote, Bush aides point
out this: That together, Bush and McCain drew 3.9 million
Californians to the polls, while Gore and Bradley attracted only
3.3 million. And McCain alone drew 40 percent of the Independent
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of George Bush and Senator McCain is a
powerful combination,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides also point to polls that suggest Gore may hold a weak
lead in California, perhaps as little as three or four percentage
points. But the greatest indicator of their confidence is simply
that the campaign has chosen to spend time here. Instead of
continuing to plow through genuine swing states as he did last
week, Bush is devoting almost an entire week to the West Coast,
traveling to Stockton and Sacramento Thursday and on to Seattle
Friday. In total, he has spent 25 days here since the campaign
began, and Wednesday marked his seventh trip since the March 7
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, we should be getting our brains beaten in
California,'' senior Bush strategist Karl Rove said. ``Gore should
be way ahead. But if you take every poll, and look at private and
public polls over the last month and average it out, we're down by
three points.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush reflected that confidence even in one of the most
Democratic sections of Ventura County, appearing before thousands
at a train station rally in Oxnard before boarding a north-bound
train along the coast. Ignoring a vocal handful of Gore supporters
in the crowd, Bush promised to repeal the estate tax, a pillar of
his stump speech. And he insisted he would not cede California as
some previous Republican candidates had.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intentions are to come here a lot, not only because it's a
pretty place but we plan to come here a lot because we intend to
carry California,'' Bush told the crowd. ``We're not writing off
any place, particularly this important state. . . . Come November,
mark my words. When the nation's watching, California will be in
the Bush-Cheney column.''

CALIFORNIA FIRM OPENS MANAGEMENT OFFICE IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Informix Corp., a 20-year-old database and e-commerce software
company based in Menlo Park, Calif., has opened an office of the
president in Westborough, Mass. with plans to expand its management
presence there, according to Peter Gyenes, the company's new
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled software company has seen its stock plummet from
$35 a share four years ago to $21.25 in April to less than $5 a
share. Wednesday Informix shares closed at $4.6875, up 6.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Named to the top post July 14, Gyenes was instrumental in
Informix's acquisition of Ardent Software Inc. in March for $1.1
billion, its largest purchase. He was chairman and chief executive
of Westborough-based Ardent.
</P>
<P>
   After the sale, Gyenes, 54, became an Informix board member. He
succeeds Jean-Yves Dexmier, who joined Informix in 1998 but served
as chief executive for just one year. He left after Informix
reported lower-than-expected sales and earnings in two quarters,
due, in part, to difficulties selling against rivals such as Oracle
Corp., and fewer sales of its Internet-retailing software.
</P>
<P>
   Gyenes said that while Menlo Park will remain the corporate
headquarters, he plans to expand the company's East Coast presence
in Westborough. Informix also has sales and service operations in
Burlington. Together they employ about 300 of the 4,400 employees
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gyenes, who has a permanent office of the president in both
Menlo Park and Westborough, said he might ``possibly bring some
West Coast people here. We have functions that we can do in
Westborough in the corporate marketing area and we have other
members of the management team here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But frankly,'' he said, ``I have been CEO for about three
weeks and I am more concerned that Informix execute on its
corporate strategy in terms of reaching customers, showing that we
can meet their requirements. We have to perform better.''
</P>
<P>
   Informix's financial problems _ some of which date back to an
accounting scandal in 1997 _ have led to an exodus of some top
executives this year from Menlo Park, according to published
reports. The company has also had trouble with its purchase of
Ardent, which has taken longer than expected to integrate and has
not provided the revenue boost and earnings Gyenes expected.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Informix said its revenues for the second quarter
were $240.5 million, compared with $250.6 million in the same
quarter last year. Net income was $4.9 million, or 2 cents a share,
compared with net income of $22 million, or 8 cents, in the second
quarter of 1999, and excludes a $112 million one-time charge. The
quarterly results include Ardent Software's financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Informix, a distant number two competitor of Oracle Corp.,
bought Ardent to gain software tools such as DataStage, a data
extraction and transformation tool aimed at the e-commerce market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the Ardent managers who was not planning to
continue in the operation, but here I am,'' said Gyenes, who
previously was president and chief executive of VMARK Software
Inc., Ardent's predecessor company.
</P>
<P>
   His ascension to the top of Informix was widely welcomed, as
some company employees and Wall Street analysts believe Gyenes can
turn the company around.

PUTTING THEIR BEST FOOT FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Corrects typo in sixth paragraph.) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA De WITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Non-fashion reporters who wouldn't know a bias cut from a bugle
bead (or care), took a break Tuesday night from Democratic National
Convention preparations to see the city's more fashionable side.
</P>
<P>
   Bused from the Staples Center to the nearby CaliforniaMart,
located in the downtown Fashion District, more than 200 reporters
and photographers put their politics aside to watch ``This Way
L.A.,'' a slick fashion showcase of more than 200 designs by 22 of
the city's most cutting-edge designers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The event also attracted a number of community leaders,
including Lee Harrington, president of the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp., who welcomed the crowd, and Mayor
Richard Riordan, who joked about his reputation as the city's
worst-dressed mayor. The show was sponsored by L.A. By Design, a
program of the LAEDC, as well as the Port of Los Angeles, the
Fashion District, the California Apparel News and the
CaliforniaMart, which was recently purchased by Hertz Investment
Group, a local real estate company.
</P>
<P>
   Ilse Metchek, event director and executive director of the
California Fashion Association, LAEDC, said holding the show just
before the convention was a great way to ``introduce the press
corps to one of the city's most creative business opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Few people, even the fashion press, realize that Los Angeles
is the No. 1 apparel manufacturing sector with a gross revenue of
$17.5 billion a year,'' said Metchek. ``Although New York is the
No. 1 marketing center, more than 107,000 people are employed in
the Los Angeles fashion district at the manufacturing level, with
another 20,000 people in the textile area that supports the apparel
manufacturing process. And then there are another 1,000 people who
represent the manufacturers with offices at the CaliforniaMart and
the New Mart (located across the street from the CaliforniaMart),
plus countless other reps who work out of their homes,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Metchek calls Los Angeles the home of throwaway chic, a city
known for cutting-edge fashion that's seen around the world in
movies, on TV, and on pop-culture icons such as Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike New York, which is famous for its tailoring and
structured garments, we have a reputation for clothes of the moment
that may or may not catch on in the rest of the country _ or the
world,'' Metchek said, adding that local designers don't have a
fear of failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I teach at local design schools such as the Fashion Institute
of Design and Merchandising, and Otis, and I have discovered
there's a real entrepreneurial climate here,'' Metchek said.
``Students tell me they'd rather start up their own company in a
garage and do every aspect of the manufacturing than (go to New
York and) be mentored by somebody like Donna Karan.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's event reflected this L.A. spirit by showcasing designs
in themes such as Venice Beach, Melrose Place, Hollywood Studios,
Olvera Street, Pacific Connection, North of Montana and Sunset
Plaza. The show started off on a hot note, with female models in
scant bathing suits and men in plaid and leather sandals _ a la
Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Tadashi Shoji, a graduate of L.A. Trade Technical College and a
high- profile example of this new breed of designer, showcased his
gowns for the more elegant Hollywood Studios segment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied lots of old films, so the press will probably notice
all of the Old Hollywood influences ... and how I pay tribute to
the glamour of stars such as Gloria Swanson, Marilyn Monroe, Rita
Hayworth and Jean Harlow in the Hollywood segment of the fashion
show,'' Shoji said in a phone conversation from his Los Angeles
offices before the show.
</P>
<P>
   His well-cut suits will soon be seen on Minnie Driver in the
film ``Beautiful,'' scheduled for a September release. Shoji
explained that he draws, drapes and oversees everything for his
small company, called Tadashi, and that allows him to keep his
prices more affordable than many East Coast evening wear labels.
His gowns, sold at local department stores such as Macy's,
Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus, as well as smaller chain stores
such as Aames and Cache, reflect his interest in costume design.
</P>
<P>
   In the Venice Beach segment, the press was treated to a new line
of young and sassy swimsuits called Becca Swim by Rebecca Virtue.
Born and raised in Southern California, Virtue simply looked to
local beaches and the colorful characters on the boardwalk for
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   And the collection shown Tuesday night included styles with
henna body art embroidered onto the suits to give the illusion of a
tattoo, as well as silver rings sewn onto bra tops for a pierced
punk look, and belly chains integrated onto low-slung bikini
bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Crank, the CEO of Lunada Bay, which is the umbrella
company for Becca Swim, said, ``We were very excited to have the
CaliforniaMart approach us about `This Way L.A.' because it gave us
an opportunity to be recognized as the powerhouse of casual
fashion. By that I mean we approach swimwear from a creative
viewpoint with a cutting edge, compared to East Coast swimsuit
manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Becca Swim, which should hit local stores by the end of
the month, Lunada Bay manufactures about 2 million suits a year for
a number of trendy labels such as XOXO, Mossimo, Girl Star and
bebe.
</P>
<P>
   The Melrose Place segment drew applause as muscle-bound male
models stripped off their bathrobes to reveal the latest looks in
mens underwear, and other models showed off Private Circle's
split-knee black faux leather pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're extremely sexy. Anything you can destroy and
keep beautiful is amazing,'' Danny Cook said of his label's
``tattered'' pants, which retail at about $88.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers who participated in the fashion show were
street-savvy names such as BC Ethic, Tru Supply, Lunar Doll, Epoch,
Dawls, Sunde, BonBons, White Rose and the new lingerie company
called Hipster G. More established labels, such as Poleci,
Hartnell, La Blanca, Casadei, Barbara Lesser, Canyon Group and
Claire's Collection were featured, as well work by the
Valencia-raised designer David Dart.
</P>
<P>
   Dart, who recently moved his offices from Chatsworth to downtown
L.A., has seen his designs on plenty of stars, from Michelle
Pfeiffer to Brooke Shields, but not on any red-carpet soirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Los Angeles, there are two fashion camps. Those who
make fashion exciting on Oscar night, and those like me, who create
fashion for every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To catch a glimpse of fashion's future, Genevieve Ostrander,
marketing director for L.A. By Design, included a collection of
designs by students from the Otis School of Design in the red,
white and blue finale. While Hipster G. gave the finale an American
flair with cowboy-, Indian-, hippie- and Lady Liberty-inspired
wear.
</P>
<P>
   The ``This Way L.A.'' fashion show is one of several events
sponsored by the LAEDC to create awareness of the city's creative
industries. Other events to be staged throughout the year will
focus on toy manufacturing, food, aerospace, architecture,
textiles, home furnishings, technology, engineering, auto design,
health services and entertainment, said Ostrander. &QL;

ARREST SPOTLIGHTS CORRUPTION IN BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ The arrest of a prominent Bosnian
banker and former government minister is being watched by foreign
officials here as a test of the government's resolve to fight
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Alija Delimustafic, an owner of BH Banka, which
collapsed two years ago owing foreign embassies and international
organizations $15 million, was arrested on Friday night and charged
with fraud and abusing his position.
</P>
<P>
   But the case ``is not just about money going missing,'' a
foreign official here said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very, very high-profile fraud case,'' the official
said. ``It's an important test case, and we want to see it
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Local news media have hinted that the affair goes to the core of
the Bosnian leadership in Sarajevo, some of whose members were
Delimustafic's close colleagues in the war from 1992 to 1995. The
government has been silent on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign officials here say corruption has reached such levels
that the powerful vested interests of the governing parties are the
major obstruction to democracy and development in Bosnia, as a
recent report by the General Accounting Office said.
</P>
<P>
   Delimustafic, 46, was arrested at the offices of his company,
Cenex, which ran the collapsed bank and still controls a trading
company, supermarket chain and an insurance company. The
well-connected businessman was interior minister in the early '90s.
In the war, he was foreign trade minister of a collapsed country
that had almost no trade and only the most tenuous links to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mirsad Bajraktarevic, head of the 120-member
financial police unit that is investigating corruption in Bosnia,
BH Banka collapsed with debts of $15 million. Some $900,000 of that
total belonged to the U.S. Agency for International Development and
represented operating funds and loan payments of its assistance
programs to Bosnia, according to the General Accounting Office
report. The Swiss Embassy has also acknowledged losing a
significant sum.
</P>
<P>
   None of the foreign creditors has retrieved money since the bank
crashed, and they have pushed the government hard to investigate
the case. Cenex has continued trading, and creditors have set their
sights on its assets, particularly a shopping center on the
southern edge of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   The center was probably built with some of the missing money,
Bajraktarevic said in an interview. ``And the bank made credits
beyond its means,'' he said, adding that the credits were not
insured.
</P>
<P>
   Bajraktarevic's task has been to track the dealings of the bank
over the last 10 years. He transferred the case to the prosecutor's
office last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very complex,'' he said. ``Twenty people were involved
in setting up the bank, and a lot of transfers were made out of the
country, and Bosnia has not signed any international conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers has been brought in to audit the bank, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another bank, the SAB Bank, collapsed with debts of $14 million,
also heavily at the expense of international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The representative for the World Bank here, Elaine Patterson,
noted that banks in transitional economies are fragile and crashes
are to be expected before regulations are in place. But the World
Bank, itself a victim of fraud in Bosnia, has pressed hard for a
full investigation and pursuit of the banks' assets to pay back
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Bajraktarevic echoed her insistence. ``We realized that if the
international community loses money in these banks,'' he said, ``it
will make it very difficult for Bosnia and Herzegovina to join the
European Union, and no investment will flow in, and there will be
no jobs, and we will remain totally isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Local news media have hinted that Delimustafic is part of a
larger network of corruption that runs to the top levels of power.
A leading independent newspaper, Dvevni Avaz, suggested that the
government might have used him as a sacrificial lamb to placate
impatient foreign officials.
</P>
<P>
   Delimustafic was arrested days after the dismissals of two
powerful figures, the head of the Federation Tax Administration,
Ramiz Dzaferovic, and Agriculture Minister Ahmed Smajic. Both were
dismissed for corruption by the high representative, Wolfgang
Petritsch, who, although he has no power over the police, can
remove officials whom are deemed to be obstructing the rebuilding.
Petritsch has dealt similarly with more than 24 senior officials in
recent months.

SOMALIA'S FREE MARKET PARADOX: PROSPEROUS BUSINESSMEN LONG FOR A
GOVERNMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia _ There are 5 competing airlines here; 3
phone companies, which have some of the cheapest rates in the
world; at least 2 pasta factories; 45 private hospitals; 55
providers of electricity; 1,500 wholesalers for imported goods; and
an infinite number of guys with donkeys who will deliver 55 gallons
of clean water to your house for 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   What Somalia does not have is a government, and in many ways,
this makes it the world's purest laboratory for capitalism. No one
collects taxes. Business is booming. Libertarians of the world
unite!
</P>
<P>
   So it may come as a surprise that business people in Mogadishu,
the wrecked and lawless capital, are begging for a government. They
would love to be taxed, and would gladly let politicians meddle at
least a bit in their affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' said Abdi Mohamed Sabria, ``it's a lot better
to pay a tax than to go through what we are going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Sabria and his partners opened a pasta factory here,
and at the moment they cannot make enough to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   But they pay $3,000 a month just for gunmen, including the one
who sits with an AK-47 across the factory's spotless concrete floor
from the pasta cutting machine. Because there is no port, they lose
up to 10 percent of their imported supplies on the beach. They had
to dig their own well. They generate their own power.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to provide everything for yourself,'' Sabria said.
``You have to collect the garbage on your own street.'' Even this
requires a payment to local toughs, who often block private garbage
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Established business people here are all too aware of the
paradox they face: what helps make their business so good _ freedom
from government _ is exactly what will kill their businesses in the
long run. It may be true that the government that is best governs
least. But at least it governs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security is the doorstep for development,'' said Mohamed Ahmed
Hirabe, an economist collecting statistics on the business climate
in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   His partner, Mohamed M. Sheik, added: ``Lack of government is
not good for the economy and the whole business environment. That
is the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   And so businesses are among the key supporters of the peace
conference in the neighboring country of Djibouti, in which some
2,000 Somalis are gathered to try yet again to establish a
government. Businessmen are backing various candidates for top
posts, in ways that make other Somalis nervous about the influence
they may have on a new government.
</P>
<P>
   But the business people argue that their success has
irreversibly altered the way government is viewed in Somalia. The
unavoidable reality is that business will shape whatever government
is formed, most likely by making it far smaller than its
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been one of the few sources of stability in Somalia
since the dictator Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991 and no one
rose to replace him. In anarchy deepened by local warlords, private
interests swooped in to provide essentials like water, telephones
and electricity _ though not in the most efficient ways.
</P>
<P>
   The three telephone companies, for instance, operate entirely
independently of one another. Having access to all people with
phones means having three telephone lines _ one from each company.
Drinkable water is delivered mostly by donkey.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggling thrives, in everything from guns to cigarettes to
electronics. One of the major exports is charcoal, to the Persian
Gulf states; the trade has caused an environmental disaster as well
as battles between tree cutters and herdsmen whose camels eat from
the trees.
</P>
<P>
   But the market's invisible hand has worked in remarkable ways:
competition is so fierce that international phone calls are just
$1.50 a minute. The main market downtown is jammed with goods.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And after Sabria's factory opened last summer, a price war
sharply cut the cost of pasta, one of Somalia's staples (it is a
former Italian colony).
</P>
<P>
   The company started off selling high-quality pasta at about $8
for a 10 kilogram box. Then importers moved to undercut them,
selling a lower-grade pasta shipped in from Dubai at $5 a box. Not
to be outdone, Sabria's company introduced its own lower-grade
line, for about $4.60 a box. Now, three months later, he says they
have wrested the market back from the importers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are crying,'' Sabria said with predatory glee. ``We still
hold them, and there is no way they can get out.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is striking that Somalia, unlike many parts of Africa, has
achieved this thriving business climate entirely on its own _
without the usual flow of assistance and advice from rich nations
(which have all but disengaged since the failure of the United
Nations operation here in early 1990s). Somalis have learned that
they are pretty good at making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entrepreneurism that's doing it,'' said Ahmed Abdisalam
Adan, director of programs for Horn Afrik, Somalia's first
independent radio and television station, established last year.
``It's who has more creativity. It's who is willing to take risks.
Before it was the government. The government could make you rich
one day and poor the next.''
</P>
<P>
   In Siad Barre's heyday, his government controlled nearly all
commerce, from airlines to sugar factories to hotels. It was
consequently one of the most corrupt on the continent _ typical of
African governments, whose leaders often run publicly owned
industry into the ground as they siphon profits into private bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the Somali businessmen's vision of a small government becomes
reality, it will be a radical departure.
</P>
<P>
   In general, businessmen say government has a strong role to play
as a regulator of existing industries. It might force the telephone
companies, for example, to integrate their lines, or ban the export
of charcoal. But, they argue, any new government should be
relatively small, focusing on essentials like roads, education and
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of services can be covered by the private people,'' said
Abdulaziz H.A. Sheikh, managing director of Somalia
Telecommunications, one of the three phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the economist, Sheik, argues that a small government is an
impossibility, given the state of Somalia's infrastructure nearly a
decade after the government fell. There are few roads, no central
power plants, no water and hardly any habitable public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is very small, who is going to rehabilitate?'' he asked.
``The private sector can't do that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Somali private sector is clearly hard pressed. Adan, 40, who
started his telecommunications company with two people who like him
had fled to Canada, said that at the outset, his private security
guards had been forced into firefights with the gunmen of a local
warlord.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone company chief, Sheikh, says thugs regularly
prevent him from digging trenches for phone cable.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller entrepreneurs, too, find it difficult to work in chaos:
Abdi Muhidin, 23, who goes to the beach near the ruined downtown
nearly every day to dig flakes of gold from the volcanic rock
there, can make as much as $10 a day, a good wage here. But often
bandits rob him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it happens,'' he said, as he scraped the rock with a
metal rod. ``What I would like to have is peace.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the eight gunmen guarding a reporter (at $200 a day)
squatted down and told Muhidin, ``I don't want a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhidin did not bother to look up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he told the gunman, ``for you it's better not to have
one.''

REPORT DETAILS WIDESPREAD NURSING HOME MEDICATION ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 150,000 US nursing home patients suffer adverse drug
reactions each year _ from dizziness to dangerous falls to
potentially fatal liver damage _ because the staff makes
preventable errors in prescribing and monitoring medications, says
a groundbreaking new study.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of Massachusetts School of
Medicine and Brigham and Women's Hospital, both in Boston, found
546 medication-related injuries at 18 Massachusetts nursing homes
over a year's time, including one death and 31 injuries that were
life threatening.
</P>
<P>
   If the results are extrapolated nationally, there are an
estimated 350,000 adverse drug events yearly in nursing homes and
20,000 of them are fatal or life-threatening, according to Dr.
Jerry Gurwitz, a gerontologist at UMass, one of the researchers in
the study. About half of those events could have been prevented, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a `forgotten' population,'' said Gurwitz,
who directs the Meyers Primary Care Institute, an initiative of
Fallon Health Care System and UMass medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Plumb, senior vice president of the Massachusetts Extended
Care Federation, which represents nursing homes, said the report
was not entirely surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking care of far more seriously ill patients than in
the past, with frail patients on more and more medications,'' he
said. ``Secondly, we're in the middle of the worst staffing crisis
we've had'' since MediCare was established in the 1960s. One in 10
nursing positions is unfilled, and there is a high turnover rate of
less-skilled staff.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the first to focus on medical errors in long-term
care facilities, found one death during the one-year study, a
patient that died from liver damage. However, other patients were
oversedated, had severe allergic reactions, developed bleeding that
sometimes requiring transfusions, fell, broke bones, got
infections, suffered weight loss or experienced other ill effects,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the errors, the researchers noted 188 ``near misses,''
errors that could have resulted in adverse effects but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The 546 medication errors picked up in the study translate to
about two errors per month, or 24 every year, in a 100-bed nursing
home, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And these figures are probably conservative'' because they
only included adverse effects that were noted in patients' charts,
said Dr. Gurwitz. The study report is being published in the August
issue of the American Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing home patients may be more vulnerable to drug reactions,
Gurwitz said, because doctors don't spend a lot of time there and
do a lot of ``telephone medicine'' where patient records aren't
always at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Medications taken by nursing home residents are prescribed by
physicians who either have patients living in the facility or who
work directly for the extended care home. In contrast to hospitals,
which have in-house pharmacies, drugs for nursing homes are
typically supplied by large, warehouse-like distributors where
pharmacists may not have full information about the patients who
will be taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   When the patient starts taking the drug, it's the nurses'
responsibility to watch for any adverse side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If the staff knows the patients well, it's easier to ``notice
the cues, which may be subtle, that a resident may be having and
adverse reaction,'' said Marva Serotkin, CEO of The Boston Home in
Dorchester, Mass., which specializes in the care of patients with
multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   But with the high staff turnover rate in today's environment of
stingy reimbursements for nursing home care, and with frequent use
of temporary employees, patients' unusual reactions are more likely
to be overlooked, said Serotkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed that one of the greatest needs is better ways of
keeping track of patient data,'' said Dr. David Bates, a Brigham
and Women's researcher and co-author of the study along with Dr.
Jerry Avorn, also at the Brigham, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently involved in adverse events was warfarin, a
blood-thinning drug that many older people take to avoid clots. The
drug has a narrow range of effectiveness and too much or too little
can be injurious. Gurwitz said some of the incidents occurred when
doctors prescribed drugs that exaggerated warfarin's effects,
leading to bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Gurwitz said that half of the events were judged as preventible:
that is, they could have been averted in the current system of
health care. The analysis also showed that the more serious adverse
events were also the most preventible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 the National Institute of Medicine estimated that as
many as 100,000 patients die every year in hospitals because of
medical errors of all kinds. Gurvitz said he and his colleagues
wanted to extend such studies to nursing home patients, who are a
population of 1.6 million nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, about 54,000 people are currently patients in
580 nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the nursing home findings to those in acute-care
hospitals, Bates of Brigham and Women's said, ``many more of the
problems in the nursing homes related to a problem with with
monitoring'' drug treatment. ``And many more of them were
preventable,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Serotkin of The Boston Home said quality improvement
programs that are common in hospitals are becoming more prevalent
in nursing homes. In one such measure, now required by federal law,
pharmacist-consultants visit nursing homes to audit drug records
and to train the staff in the safe use of medications, Serotkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Growing concern over medication errors in the past several
errors have led many hospitals to install computerized systems that
automatically check dosages, drug interactions and research
protocols to prevent mistkaken drug prescription. Most nursing
homes, however, can't afford the costly equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Some do have, them however, and Gurwitz said he and his
co-authors are preparing for a study of two such nursing homes, one
in Toronto and one in Connecticut, to see how effective they are in
reducing medication errors.

AN `AFFAIR` TO FORGET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The French import ``An Affair of Love'' is more a parlor trick
than a film _ a pretty intriguing one, but a parlor trick all the
same. It documents the rise and fall, so to speak, of an apparently
kinky sexual relationship without revealing the participants' names
or occupations or much of their personalities _ and it also coyly
declines to specify what their particular fantasy life entailed.
</P>
<P>
   Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez play the couple _ he responds to
her personals ad, they meet in a Paris bistro, make some awkward
small talk and high-tail it for a nearby hotel room, leaving the
camera tantalizingly on the other side of the door. Emerging from
the room, their faces are blank, their good-bye busses desultory.
This pattern continues for a time; since sex preceded their melding
of minds, conversation flows more freely than it otherwise might,
and the only time we're allowed beyond the door is for a session of
what they call ``normal'' lovemaking.
</P>
<P>
   The constraints they've placed upon themselves begin,
inevitably, to strain their elliptical relationship. Their
``Rashomon''-like memories of the affair contradict one another.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``After Life,'' an affecting, winsome Japanese film
released last year, ``An Affair of Love'' depends a lot on your own
imagination and emotional contribution to the film, placing
yourself in the characters' positions and conjuring up images of
what happens behind that door and in their everyday lives. (``After
Life,'' however, was not about remotely sex, but people selecting
the one memory from their lives that they wanted to retain in
death.)
</P>
<P>
   The sexual McGuffin, however, becomes fairly irrelevant, as
director Frederic Fonteyne and writer Philippe Blasband seek to
strip a relationship to its bare bones _ sex and conversation _ to
divine what causes them to crumble. In fact, though, mundane,
day-to-day stuff contributes to love's decline just as much, just
as it also enriches affections, as well. Ultimately, Fonteyne and
Blasband deduce that lovers' needless misinterpretations of one
another's feelings can result in tragic breakups; if you need a
movie to tell you that, more's the pity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baye and Lopez serve as generically attractive tabulas
rasa for viewers to project upon, and still manage to give studied,
nuanced performances that hint at the lives they're not allowed to
discuss. Melancholy drapes over the proceedings as the film
suggests that in addition to the door separating the camera from
our athletic couple, there's also a palpable barrier separating our
lovers from the strangers in our own brains. &QL;

COMMENTARY: SMILES ALL AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a clever strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich is gone. And the others _ the Strom Thurmonds, the
Trent Lotts, the Tom DeLays, the Dick Armeys _ are all wearing
camouflage outfits and hiding in the tall grass. They will stay
there at least until November.
</P>
<P>
   What we see on television is the perfect front man, George W., a
happy-go-lucky guy who hasn't a harsh word to say about anyone, and
the avuncular Dick Cheney. They are meant to epitomize mainstream
America, and to deflect (via images that could have been crafted by
Norman Rockwell) any suggestion that the GOP is extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Al Gore with his brand new running buddy, Joe
Lieberman. At the moment they are sprinting away from Bill Clinton.
No sex, please, we're religious. But their real mission is to
convince voters that they are closer to the so-called mainstream
than Bush and Cheney, and that the reality of the GOP is something
other than moderate, tolerant, inclusive and kind.
</P>
<P>
   This is not easy without the delightfully unabashed
mean-spiritedness we've come to associate with the GOP ( Gingrich
once told a group of young Republicans, ``I think one of the great
problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don't encourage
you to be nasty.'' Tom DeLay has characterized the Environmental
Protection Agency as the ``Gestapo of the government.'')
</P>
<P>
   George W. may need a cheat sheet when it comes to naming world
leaders, but he was smart enough to recognize the need to put a
friendlier face on his party.
</P>
<P>
   But is a friendly face enough?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest decision Bush and Gore have had to make so far was
picking a running mate, and a comparison of their choices is
instructive.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, Joe Lieberman is pretty moderate. He
supports the Clinton administration's budget and trade policies,
favors a cut in the capital gains tax, is pro-choice on abortion,
feels strongly about protecting the environment, voted for the
Clinton administration's welfare reform legislation, is willing to
experiment with school vouchers, and has taken a harsh stand
against what he views as excessive sex and violence in the
entertainment industry.

   Dick Cheney is another story. His avuncular persona is one
thing. But his political views are something else. The Republican
Party can't find a smile wide enough to conceal those aspects of
his congressional voting record that were way outside the American
mainstream. At times he was more extreme than the guys now hiding
in the high grass.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Dick Armey and Tom DeLay were part of the overwhelming
majority to vote for the AIDS Federal Policy Act, which was the
first major bill to provide funds for AIDS testing and counseling.
Dick Cheney was one of only 13 House members to vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 and 1987 he voted against funding the Older Americans
Act, which offered nutrition and other services to the elderly. He
voted repeatedly against funding for Head Start. (Now that the
national spotlight is on him, he says he will support Head Start.)
He voted against subsidizing school lunches for poor children. He
voted against aid to college students. He voted against fair
housing legislation. He was one of only eight members of the House
to vote against the Clean Water Act in 1987, and was one of only 21
to vote against the Safe Water Drinking Act in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He is far outside the mainstream on abortion. He has
consistently opposed abortion even in cases of rape and incest, and
even when the life of the mother is at stake. That, to most
Americans, is extreme.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the legislation to ban plastic guns, which
could not be detected by airport security. Even the National Rifle
Association supported that measure. But not Cheney. He was one of
only four members of the house to vote against the ban. You will
not find many Americans of any political persuasion who would
support that position.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney is way out there.
</P>
<P>
   But he's got a nice, quiet, steady way about him. He doesn't
look like an extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman believe their views are in sync with the real
American mainstream. But they will have a tough time trying to
unmask this year's happy-face Republicans.

SEARCHING FOR A SUNKEN SHIP TO HONOR 778 JEWS KILLED IN TURKISH

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Greg Buxton is searching for sunken treasure
of an elusive nature _ not gold or artifacts, but memories of 778
lives lost and largely forgotten in the depths of the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Thursday, he and a crew of volunteers will scour
the seabed north of here with sonar for the Struma, a steamer sunk
by a Russian submarine in 1942. The victims were mainly Romanian
and Russian Jews fleeing the Holocaust. Among them were Buxton's
paternal grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The search and an attempt to organize a memorial ceremony next
month have resurrected a wartime tragedy. They are provoking
discomfort in Turkey _ the authorities recently indicated that they
might not allow divers to approach the ship if it is found _ and
renewing old questions about the response of other countries to the
Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The Struma death toll was small compared with the totals in the
millions in Europe. But Radu Ioanid, a scholar at the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, said the sinking
symbolized the indifference of many countries to the plight of the
Jews during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Struma's journey was desperate from the start. Fleeing
massacres and labor camps, nearly 800 people paid $1,000 each for
passage on the ship from Romania's Black Sea coast to Palestine.
The passengers were jammed onto the 150-foot vessel, with makeshift
bunks stacked 10 high and only one freshwater outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ship left Constanza, Romania, on Dec. 11, 1941, the
Romanian police took almost everything of worth, down to the copper
pots in the galley. The engine failed a few miles out of port, and
the captain of a passing tug repaired it in exchange for the
wedding rings of the passengers, their only remaining valuables.
</P>
<P>
   The Struma limped along for three days, but its engine failed
again, and Turkish tugs towed it into Istanbul. Fearing that
passengers might try to remain in the country, the police kept them
on board while the Turkish and British authorities decided their
fate. Istanbul's Jews donated food, but conditions grew squalid as
talks dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which controlled Palestine, was generally unwilling to
let in large numbers of refugees, and this case proved no
exception. British officials refused to allow the passengers to
continue without visas. Three people with expired visas were
permitted to proceed overland, and a family of four left the ship
through the intervention of Vehbi Koc, an influential Turkish
Muslim businessman, who intervened at the request of an associate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an emotional debate in Parliament in London, the British
would not budge. Turkey was struggling to remain neutral in the war
and feed its population and did not want to provide sanctuary for
more people.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy days after its arrival, on the evening Feb. 23, 1942,
the Turkish police took over the Struma and towed it up the
Bosporus to the Black Sea. It was set adrift without a working
engine. At dawn the next day, a Russian submarine sank it with a
single torpedo. There has never been an explanation of why a
Russian submarine would have attacked the Struma, a nonmilitary
steamer out of a neutral port.
</P>
<P>
   David Stoliar was 19, fleeing Romania with his girlfriend and
her family when the ship was torpedoed. Now 77 and living in Bend,
Ore., he remembers each detail of that morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the lucky ones who was blown up into the air, and
I fell into the sea,'' Stoliar said in a telephone interview
Wednesday. ``When I came to the surface, there was nothing except a
tremendous amount of debris and many, many people swimming in the
water. It was very, very cold, and slowly we had a hard time moving
our feet and our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoliar recalled fighting to stay afloat as the number of
swimmers dwindled. As night fell, he was clinging to a piece of
deck with a Bulgarian crewman. He saw no one else.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning Turks from a lighthouse plucked the two men
from the water. The crewman was dead and, it turned out, so was
everyone else _ 103 children, 269 women and 406 men.
</P>
<P>
   Buxton, a computer programmer in Birmingham, England, heard the
tale of the Struma from his father, Michael, now 83 _ who, a young
Romanian at the time of the sinking, had enlisted in the British
Army. Two years ago he decided to locate the ship, film it and
conduct a memorial service to honor the grandparents he had never
met. He sold his house to finance the effort and received some
money from the Washington Holocaust museum.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is finding the wreckage, which is believed to be
in about 250 feet of water 7 to 10 miles offshore. A museum and
foundation affiliated with the Koc family, one of Turkey's
wealthiest, is providing a research ship, and the museum director,
Selcuk Kolay, will supervise the search.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual diving may not take place. Buxton said he had
earlier received permission from the Turkish authorities for
experienced divers to survey and film the Struma after it was
located. But recently the authorities have reversed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials declined to discuss the matter. It is unclear
whether the objection is a result of a bureaucratic snag, or
whether, as a Western diplomat theorized, the government is
uncomfortable about publicizing the wartime incident.
</P>
<P>
   As the tour boats and tankers plowed the Bosporus outside his
hotel, Buxton tried to be philosophical. Whether the ship is found
and the dive goes forward, he said, the memorial service on Sept. 3
will serve as a proper farewell to the 778 victims.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of some passengers are expected to attend, and
Stoliar, the lone survivor, said he would like to come to offer his
own goodbyes.

TRYING TOO HARD FOR APPROVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' screened at Q Cinema, Fort
Worth's Gay &AMP; Lesbian Film Festival, it drew a sellout crowd and
enthusiastic response. It's baffling, then, to see the bludgeoning
the movie has taken from some critics. Yeah, the film's hardly
perfect, but it's far from worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be interesting to see someone put a little more
teeth into a satire about ``curing'' homosexuality. ``Cheerleader''
is just too nice about it. Director Jamie Babbit seems to want to
avoid the mean-spiritedness of the homophobia that her movie sends
up, but more than that, she wants the movie to be liked. She
shouldn't have to try so hard; after all, it's already preaching to
the converted.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Lyonne plays Megan, who doesn't give much thought to
sexual orientation one way or the other; after all, she's a
cheerleader, and she has a boyfriend, so she must be straight,
right? But Babbit and screenwriter Brian Wayne Peterson give things
away too fast: Not only does Megan have slo-mo daydreams about her
cheering-squad mates, she also has pictures of scantily clad women
decorating her locker, and she's a vegetarian who listens to _
gasp! _ Melissa Etheridge.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie had been more ambiguous about Megan, it might have
had more resonance. As it is, it's a sporadically funny tale about
gay rehabilitation as Megan's parents and friends shanghai her to a
camp that ``fixes'' gay teens. Predictably, Megan falls for one of
her campmates, the cynically earthy Graham (Clea DuVall), and the
movie begins to feel like an overtly lesbian ``Girl, Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the most amusing moments use the same sort of
stereotype-mocking humor that dominated the decidedly more
mainstream ``In &AMP; Out.'' All involve RuPaul Charles working (out of
drag) as a counselor trying to instruct the males in the rituals of
manhood: i.e., auto mechanics, football and chopping wood. It's a
sign that the movie's eager to please, and it offers enough laughs
to be pleasing. But it should have been eager to rage. &QL;

As immigrants from non-English-speaking countries flow into the

customers whose first language is not English. The notion of
English as the sole language of American business and political
life is being challenged, swamped by new demographic and market
realities. The demand for translators and translation services has
soared. Hispanics spent about $380 billion last year on products

   GRAPES _ BOONVILLE, N.C. - In the four decades he's grown
tobacco, Frank Hopson never worried about the rising and setting of
the sun. ``Tobacco's a weed,'' and will grow just about anywhere,
he always figured. But now one of a fast growing number of North
Carolina farmers growing grapes to supply area vineyards,
57-year-old Hopson has learned to pay attention to sunshine and
other considerations critical to growing sweet, firm grapes. The
payoff? A crop that agricultural experts say won't replace North
Carolina's embattled, nearly billion-dollar-a-year crop, but one
that is acre for acre as profitable as tobacco.

especially those at the Carter Center, who are working with China
on standardizing village elections _ that this communist country is

found UPS had committed a ``sham transaction.'' As a result, the
company may now be forced to pay the IRS one of the largest bills

 AURA-DUEL10-COX &HT;    Like many parents, Atlantans are caught in the middle as advice
mavens Laura Schlessinger and John Rosemond spar over child care
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For millions of stressed-out parents, radio host Dr. Laura and
family psychologist John Rosemond are the twin titans of tough
love.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over the media landscape, both have emerged as stars of
radio, TV, the Internet and newspaper columns. Between them, they
have authored more than a dozen how-to books for confused mommies
and daddies.
</P>
<P>
   They are proudly conservative and deeply religious. Their
careers have been built on nagging (Laura Schlessinger) and nudging
(Rosemond) their followers toward a child-rearing promised land: a
disciplined, spiritually fulfilled family.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, there's been trouble in paradise.
</P>
<P>
   They've never met, but Rosemond and Schlessinger have spent
recent weeks sparring publicly on an issue that 9-to-5 parents have
been agonizing over for decades: putting kids in day care.
</P>
<P>
   And as the sparks fly, Rosemond vs. Schlessinger has done more
than just prompt thought about day care. The tiff also exposes the
pitfalls of taking celebrity advicemongers too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Child rearing, says Laurie Bengochea of Alpharetta, Ga., who has
four children ages 8 to 20, ``is like being in a war.''
Schlessinger and Rosemond, she says, ``are like two generals
telling you to read the manual. But when you're in battle, you
can't sort it all out that easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemond, who has a family practice in North Carolina, has
recommended day care when both parents work, regardless of their
reasons for working.
</P>
<P>
   The feud apparently started in May on CNN's ``Larry King Live,''
when Dr. Laura criticized working parents who put their children in
day care. When asked by King if couples should avoid having
children if they plan on putting them in day care, Dr. Laura
answered: ``Yes. If you're not going to make them your first
priority, get a parakeet.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters later solicited Rosemond's opinion of Dr. Laura's
remarks, he wrote a July column, accusing her of
``self-righteousness'' and ``unbending dogmatism.'' (Rosemond's
weekly column appears in the AJC; Schlessinger's radio show is
carried locally on WGST, 640 AM.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura in turn slammed Rosemond in a radio show. Her office
would not return calls seeking a tape or transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemond, who is to appear in Atlanta tonight as part of a
public-television fund-raising drive, fired another salvo in a
telephone interview. He questioned Dr. Laura's credentials,
pointing out that Schlessinger's eponymous doctorate is in
physiology, not psychology. (Rosemond has a master's in psychology
and a license to practice in the state of North Carolina.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand to listen to her for more than five minutes,
she's such a know-it-all,'' Rosemond said. ``We both call ourselves
conservatives, but we're not on the same team. I would love to
debate her on the air. But it would have to be arranged by Don
King, not Larry King.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura, who is based in Los Angeles, declined an interview
request, but her position on day care is well-known. She has often
referred to working mothers with children in day care as
``selfish'' and sternly warned them about the dangers of
``parenthood by proxy'' _ which is also the title of her latest
book.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Dr. Laura warns that a generation of children raised in
day care has contributed to juvenile delinquency, high divorce
rates and a growing acceptance of antisocial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her opinions on child care show that we don't have the same
family values,'' Rosemond said. ``I believe the marriage should
come first. She believes the child should come first. I think the
center of attention should be the adults, not children.''
</P>
<P>
   Bengochea of Alpharetta is stay-at-home mom who sides with Dr.
Laura. Her husband works full-time outside the home, and she has
never considered putting her children in day care to pursue a
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your career is more important than your children, then you
are very selfish,'' Bengochea said. ``If you don't have to be a
working mom, why should you be?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem I have with Dr. Laura is that she's not very
graceful when she gives advice. She can be brutal, and that makes
it more difficult for some parents who may be feeling guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura's take-no-prisoners style and strident position on day
care may inspire guilt in her callers, but it has made her much
more famous than Rosemond, who is best known for his hard-line
approach to issues such as potty training and child discipline.
Schlessinger boasts a daily audience of 2 million listeners who
tune in for her topical tongue lashings on radio.
</P>
<P>
   Make that 2 million minus Ellen Fix, 44, of Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to listen to her on the radio, but she stressed me out
so much that I stopped,'' said Fix, an advertising copy writer who
has a 7-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids were in day care from 3 months until they went to
school, and they're in the gifted program getting straight A's,''
Fix said. ``If you listen to her, you'll spend every waking minute
with them wiping their butts until they're 18. Now that's what
makes them juvenile delinquents.''
</P>
<P>
   The day care decision was not so easy for Larry and Donnah
Wilson of Acworth. Long before Schlessinger and Rosemond became
celebrity kibitzers, the couple agonized over child care issues
when Donnah decided to earn a college degree. The only experts they
trusted were each other, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't an easy call for us, and I think from my wife's
perspective her natural urge was to stay home with the kids,'' said
Larry Wilson, 51, a pediatric nurse practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife's decision to advance her education has paid off,
Wilson says. She not only earned a degree in occupational therapy,
but also a degree of respect and admiration from her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the right decision because she really enjoys
her work, and my kids saw this woman who went back to school in her
30s and became very successful,'' he said. ``It's funny, though,
that my wife and I don't listen to Dr. Laura, but our kids do.''
</P>
<P>
   Doree Lynn, a practicing psychologist in Washington and author
of the upcoming book ``Getting Sane Without Going Crazy'' (Xlibris,
$25), has been keeping tabs on the tiff between Dr. Laura and
Rosemond.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn says she believes that divergent opinions on difficult
issues such as day care are more helpful than harmful for parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people hear these so-called experts disagree, maybe they'll
say, `Wait a minute, there is no one right answer,''' Lynn said.
``The only real danger here is if we take complete strangers and
empower them to lead our lives for us in 20-second sound bites.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa DeGrace, 37, of Tucker, says she isn't swayed much by
celebrity therapists when it comes to raising her 10-year-old
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people listen to them mostly for shock value or
entertainment, but I form my own opinions,'' DeGrace says. ``My
daughter was in day care since she was 3 months old. I've always
had to work and I never felt guilty. I'm very glad aon WGTV

Television from 8 to 9:30 tonight to take part in WGTV's August

A STUNNING, GORY `TITUS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost lost amid the number of interesting films that came out
at the end of last year was Julie Taymor's ``Titus,'' a vital and
visually stunning adaptation of one of Shakespeare's early plays.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor, who is currently in Los Angeles for this fall's
production of the staged version of ``The Lion King,'' is one of a
recent number of stage directors who have moved into film. Sam
Mendes with ``American Beauty'' has had the most success, but
Taymor's imaginative staging of what is considered the Bard's
goriest play, ``Titus Andronicus,'' makes her someone to watch in
the cinematic world.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what makes ``Titus'' visually provocative is the
choreography. Not choreography in a dance sense, of course, but the
movement within the frame. Rather than relying simply on camera
work, Taymor puts figures and groups in motion to create her
operatic vision.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins with a modern-day boy playing violently with his
toy soldiers. Suddenly he is transported to the first century in
the Colosseum where Roman soldiers caked in bluish-gray mud march
toward him in a stylized, robotic fashion much like a wind-up toy
would.
</P>
<P>
   What follows in the guise of politics and noble bearing is
vicious, childish behavior, and Taymor runs with it. The shocks in
``Titus'' _ and there are many (there is even a Hannibal Lecter
reference in Anthony Hopkins' grisly performance of the title role)
_ speak of a violent time and of our violent natures. The
machinations in ``Titus'' make any modern political campaign look
like a picnic. Still, it serves as a fable relevant to today
(though we do not literally eat our young). To help this along, the
setting is as much fascist Italy as it is ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor elicits fine performances from the entire cast, including
Jessica Lange as sizzling Tamora, the Goth Queen; Harry J. Lennix
as the devious Aaron; and Alan Cumming as Saturninus, the decadent
emperor. (Cumming, who was the emcee in Mendes' reinvented stage
version of ``Cabaret,'' plays decadent better than anyone.)
</P>
<P>
   Throw in dazzling costumes and staging and Elliot Goldenthal's
terrific score, and ``Titus'' becomes a feast for the senses.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Smokin': There is one reason to see Jane Campion's film
``Holy Smoke'': Kate Winslet's performance. The story of a young
Australian woman (Winslet) who joins a religious cult and is _ at
the behest of her parents _ kidnapped by a crazy deprogrammer
(Harvey Keitel) is wildly uneven. What keeps it afloat is Winslet's
no-holds-barred approach to her character.
</P>
<P>
   While the film seems to be about cults, it's really a battle of
the sexes. And who better than Keitel and Winslet to go at it? It's
enough to make you overlook the fact that ``Holy Smoke'' lacks a
cohesive point of view and realistic character development.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Make 'Room': The 1983 Merchant-Ivory production of ``A
Room With a View'' picked up eight Oscar nominations, winning
three. The film, which came out on DVD for the first time early
this summer, is a delight, with a witty screenplay by Ruth Prawer
Jhabvala. It boasts wonderful performances from some of England's
finest actors _ Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, the late
Denholm Elliot, Daniel Day-Lewis, Julian Sands and Judi Dench. In a
summer of mindless big-budget garbage, it's the perfect antidote. &QL; 
____
</P>
<P>
   ``Titus'' (Fox) is priced at $103.99 for VHS and $34.90 for the
DVD, which includes commentary by director Julie Taymor, scene
specific commentary by stars Anthony Hopkins and Harry J. Lennix, a
Q&AMP;A with Taymor and a ``making of'' documentary. ``Holy Smoke''
(Miramax) is $103.99 for VHS and $29.99 for the DVD. ``A Room With
a View'' (Image) is $29.99 for the DVD. &QL;

TOUGH QUESTIONS ARISE FROM WORST FIRE SEASON IN 50 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Mont. _ After a steep hike to the top of a hill
overlooking Dixon Creek near here, Bobby Kitchens pointed to a
mound of rubble surrounded by blackened trees, smoking stumps, and
everywhere, a 2-inch layer of gray soot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one beautiful home, someone's dream home, with one
beautiful view,'' he said, sweeping an arm across the Stygian
panorama left behind by forest fires that swept through this area
on Sunday. A thick fog of smoke still lingered in the air, and,
stretching into the misty horizon, all that could be seen on the
rolling hills below were blackened tree stalks, many still smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The house that Kitchens, a Forest Service information officer,
was pointing out had been reduced to ashen remnants of someone's
lost mountain lifestyle: twisted tin; stones from a toppled
chimney; a half-melted refrigerator; some charred mattress springs;
and a scorched television set overturned when the table it was
resting upon burned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people did a lot of things right in protecting their
house. They just didn't do enough,'' said Kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of what officials are calling the nation's worst
fire season in more than 50 years _ with 70 major fires consuming
over a million acres of forests in a dozen Western states _ Forest
Service officials are having to answer a lot of questions about the
unprecedented dimension of this summer's crop of forest fires, said
Kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say, `Why don't you just put out those fires?'
Frankly, it's just not that simple,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sheer magnitude of this year's fires, trends
in population migration and the Forest Services own policies
exacerbate the difficulty of combating them, according to Kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, he said, is what the Forest Service refers to as
``human interface.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got too many people moving into heavily wooded areas
like this. There's no way we can save a home like this, positioned
at the top of hill, surrounded by all these trees. It's just not
going to happen,'' he said. ``When humans interface with the
natural environment in a remote setting, you're going to have
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fighting fires for 37 years, and I see a definite
trend. It used to be we'd never see a house or structure when we
were on a fire, but these days, it's rare that you have a fire
where you are not trying to save buildings and people,' said
Kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   The official policy of the Forest Service, he said, is to
protect people and structures first, then to worry about putting
out the fire. ``Saving houses and buildings diverts resources away
from containing the fires, so you ultimately get bigger fires with
more destruction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And no place is that problem more apparent than here in the
Bitterroot River Valley of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of property damage, the valley may be the most
vulnerable part of the state to forest fires. Ravalli County, where
Hamilton rests, is the fastest-growing county in Montana, having
grown 40 percent in the last eight years. There are 35,000 people
living in the dry Ponderosa pine forests in the valley bottom.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where the fires burn the hottest, said Bill Armold,
a planner for Ravalli County.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have come here because it's the last best place,''
Armold said. ``It's an unspoiled picturesque mountain valley with
views, a river and wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those people is Lisa Wissenbach, who was canning tomatoes
on Sunday when a city official told her it was time to evacuate the
home she and her husband had built in the community of Pinesdale
near here.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, she was still staying at a junior high school in
Hamilton with her five children, waiting to hear if her home would
survive the fires moving near Pinesdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me that this might happen. We even let
the fire insurance lapse when my husband was changing jobs, and
now, with the fires on, the company won't reinstate us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth and Bob Sporer had read a lot of magazines about the
Bitterroot Valley and fallen in love with the area before they had
even seen it, said Sporer, a retired heavy equipment operator from
El Cajon, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a place to get out of the rat race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Sporers were forced to evacuate their dream home
when the fires turned their way. They have not been back since.
They have heard their home is still standing, though two nearby
homes and most of the trees have burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our neighbors got in and said everything in their home is
black with ash and dirt from the fire. And I just got new bedroom
furniture,'' Sporer said. ``But at least the house is still
standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sporer shook his head emphatically when asked whether the
charred landscape would force him from his mountain refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't discourage me that much. I'll have to cut down some
burned trees. But things will grow back. It'll green up, if we ever
get any rain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the growing fire problem is a contradiction that
has not been addressed, according to Forest Service officials.
</P>
<P>
   Western ecosystems have adapted to periodic, low intensity fires
that clean out accumulated debris and thin the number of trees. But
for decades the policy has been to suppress all fires, and people
have built their home amid a dangerous accumulation of fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think the more trees you have, the healthier the
forest, but actually, it's just the opposite,'' said Jerry
Williams, director of Fire and Aviation Management for the Northern
Region of the U.S. Forest Service in Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy forest has 60 to 70 trees per acre. Instead, we have
600 to 700 trees per acre here and it's the driest period ever
recorded in some places. These places are very vulnerable to high
intensity fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As fire officials here noted that single-digit humidity, high
temperatures, and an extended drought had conspired to create
almost textbook conditions for more fires, they warned local
residents Wednesday to brace themselves for an incoming lightning
storm that was recording 300 strikes per hour just west of here
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot guarantee that we can protect every structure,''
said Jack Sept, chief of external affairs at the National
Interagency Fire Center. ``That's the cold truth.''

 &HT;    Reform Party rivals battling for high stakes
 &HT;    By Saeed Ahmed
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For political junkies tired of tightly choreographed
conventions and eager for a little mudslinging, the Reform Party
gathering this week promises to be must-see TV.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day nominating convention that begins in Long Beach,
Calif., today pits one-time GOP fixture Pat Buchanan against
loyalists of party founder Ross Perot who want the conservative
commentator disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   They say Buchanan padded voter rolls in the party's national
mail-in primary and refused to turn over a list of those who
received ballots from him.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high: the fractured party's future, the
presidential nomination and $12.5 million in federal matching
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The hostility between the two camps came to a boil Tuesday, when
Buchanan called a pre-convention national meeting and overturned
his disqualification using the majority of delegates he has
garnered touring the country and creating new chapters.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown degenerated into a shouting, shoving match, with
Perot loyalists storming out and promising to run a rival
convention in the same convention center and nominate their own
candidate. They also are considering a lawsuit to block Buchanan
from gaining access to the federal matching funds that Perot earned
in the 1996 election by winning 9 percent of the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over until we defeat the Brownshirts and despicable
tactics of the Buchanan campaign,'' said national secretary Jim
Mangia, who led the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre turn of events could mean a hostile face-off between
the two Reform Party factions on the opening day of the convention
today.
</P>
<P>
   So combustible is the atmosphere that organizers have beefed up
security, with state and local police outside the convention halls,
installed metal detectors at the entrances and stationed a dozen
bouncers inside to handle any rowdy outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared for every eventuality in terms of physical
threats, because there will be people there who will try to disrupt
the proceedings,'' said Gerald Moan, the interim party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buchanan, who claims that ``it is pretty much the end
of the Reform Party'' if he is denied the nomination, is so sure of
getting the party nod that he has alerted reporters to the time and
place of his victory party.
</P>
<P>
   But lost in all the brouhaha is the man standing between
Buchanan and the $12.6 million: John Hagelin. A nuclear physicist
from Iowa and a third-time nominee of the Natural Law Party,
Hagelin agreed to run on the Reform ticket at the behest of Perot
supporters who needed someone to block the socially-conservative
Buchanan after their leader declined entreaties to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over a year, I have been campaigning to forge a powerful
coalition of America's leading third parties, and the Reform Party
in the past has been such a powerful voice for reform in America
(that) it was a perfect fit,'' Hagelin said.
</P>
<P>
   Like his opponent, the secular and socially liberal Hagelin
believes that in the end the nomination will belong to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the courts talk to the lawyers, the lawyers will tell them
that the faction that holds up legally with the proper
credentialing procedures is ours, and the other is just a Buchanan
pageant,'' Hagelin said.
</P>
<P>
   The party's convention lasts until Sunday. Perot loyalist Mangia
promises more turmoil, and Buchanan backer Moan agrees: ``You ain't
seen nothing yet.''

BRAZIL STRONG SECOND QUARTER SPURS RECOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
  By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazil's economy grew 3.92 percent in the
second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, the
government said on Wednesday in a report that suggested the
country's recovery from its devastating currency crisis in early
1999 was accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the National Statistics Institute was stronger
than many forecasters had expected. It led some to project that
growth rates for the second half of the year and in 2001 would also
be stronger than forecast as the country benefits from a series of
interest rate reductions made by the central bank this spring to
stimulate borrowing and spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that we are having a really solid recovery,'' said
Gustavo Loyola, a consultant at Tendencias Consultoria and a former
president of the central bank. ``Investor and consumer confidence
is growing. Barring any imported crises, we can expect even better
growth for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months of the year, Brazil's gross domestic
product grew 3.84 percent compared with the period in 1999, when a
devaluation of the currency, the real, in January sent shock waves
throughout the economy and reduced that year's growth to little
more than 1 percent. Analysts say that the six-month results now
make the government's growth target of 4 percent this year
achievable. For next year, economists expect growth of around 4.5
percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural production was a major contributor to
second-quarter growth as crops of coffee, soybeans and other
staples grew by 10.75 percent, more than expected. Brazil's
industrial production growth rate of 4.34 percent in the quarter
was also considered a strong sign of steady expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agricultural production is a volatile figure that can vary
greatly from year to year,'' said Andre Carvalho, chief economist
at the Federation of Industry of the State of Sao Paulo.
``Industrial growth usually builds on itself every quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Carvalho said companies were taking advantage of cuts in
interest rates to finance expansion, which will add to growth
figures over the next year. At the same time, the central bank's
recent reduction of compulsory reserve requirements has allowed
banks to offer more credit to industry and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, consumers have been shy about spending more
aggressively, but cheaper credit and a gradual fall in the
unemployment rate are expected to entice shoppers in the second
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The strong growth figures come at a propitious time for
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, whose administration has
recently been accused of being involved in the embezzlement of more
than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a continuing Senate investigation, Cardoso's approval
rating increased to 19 percent in July from 13 percent the month
before, according to the pollsters Vox Populi.

ROOTED ON THE EDGE OF THE HEARTLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll demands some degree of self-exile. The music's
idiosyncratic champions do not fit easily into families, whether
biological or ideological. Yet many still want to claim a legacy to
root their visions, and especially as they grow older, many seek
images in red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   There's a whole subculture, Americana, devoted to the outcasts'
reclamation of country and blues music. Steve Earle, the Ralph
Nader of country music, is its patriarch. Artists like the Jayhawks
and Whiskeytown's Ryan Adams, both of whom have new releases, have
found artistic success by stressing craft and tradition over
trendiness. Sometimes the strum and twang seem studied, but
Americana artists offer a respite from the mainstream's
high-concept hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Even this homesteader's camp, however, has its outsiders. Four
of the best Americana-flavored albums of the summer are by artists
who aren't the darlings of the post-punk bootstrap set. They've all
long mined the tension between rock iconoclasm and the urge to
connect to a legacy. These voices from the edge of the heartland
enhance the traditions they honor in music that invites listeners
to contemplate their own relationship to rootlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Lonesome Cowboy
</P>
<P>
   Chip and Tony Kinman have taken a twisted path to end up in a
niche that always suited them. These brothers first gained notice
in the California punk band the Dils, then practically founded the
Americana style in the raucous Rank and File. A detour into
proto-electronica, as Blackbird, didn't logically lead to Cowboy
Nation, but the duo must have missed those 10-gallon hats, because
they're wearing them now.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy Nation is a trio (Jamie Spidle plays drums) enacting a
costume drama of Western music. The band's originals on ``A Journey
Out of Time'' (Western Jubillee/Shanachie) detail barroom gunfights
and storm-chasing on the prairie, and the covers are chestnuts:
``Back in the Saddle,'' ``Shenandoah.'' Yet for all its careful
re-enactment, Cowboy Nation is direct and unpretentious. Chip
Kinman's rumble of a voice embodies lonesomeness, and the trio's
taciturn energy lends color to the legends it relates.
</P>
<P>
   Making Blues New
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitley is an expert at finding something new in the
exile's stance. A Texas bluesman who incorporates East Village
noise-rock into his own songs, Whitley gives new faces to the
demons of blues cliche. On ``Perfect Day'' (New Machine/Valley
Entertainment), an amazing exercise in quiet intensity, he
collaborates with the jazz-fusion rhythm section Billy Martin and
Chris Wood and the producer Craig Street in taking a knife to a
collection of classic rock and blues songs.
</P>
<P>
   Bookended by ``Spanish Harlem Incident'' and ``4th Time Around''
by Bob Dylan _ rock's original roots-ripper _ ``Perfect Day'' also
features songs by Lou Reed and the Doors, Robert Johnson, Muddy
Waters and Willie Dixon. Whitley's eerie, tender voice dominates,
often obscuring his fleet guitar and the rhythm section's delicate
rumble. What emerges is a portrait of introspection that recalls
other famous loners from Nick Drake to Chet Baker.
</P>
<P>
   A Country Woman
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Picketts, Christy McWilson specialized in
rootsy fun. But the band never got far beyond the Seattle bar
scene, and McWilson endured several dark years of the soul. ``The
Lucky One'' (Hightone) is a burst out of inertia, an excellent
account of the realistic life.
</P>
<P>
   With help from her many friends, including the Blasters' Dave
Alvin, who produced, Peter Buck and Mike Mills of REM, Syd Straw
and Rhett Miller, McWilson offers finely wrought versions of her
worldly-wise songs. Her alto, in classic country fashion, mixes
equal parts yearning and resignation, and her accounts of
motherhood and middle age rank her as a star in the rapidly
developing subgenre of grown-up gal music. Fans of Amy Rigby and
Patti Larkin shouldn't miss this album, where they'll find more
evidence of artistically fruitful adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   All-Americana Classics
</P>
<P>
   If one path of Americana leads back to the Kinman brothers,
another lands at the open kitchen door of Jason Ringenberg, the
prototypical country punk, who still sometimes leads his band of
happy renegades, the Scorchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Pocketful of Soul'' (Courageous Chicken Records) is a barn
raiser more than a barn burner. Its lovely songs, centered around
Ringenberg's whippoorwill croon, esteem family, history, and, yes,
Christianity with characteristic aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing out of the ordinary jumps out of songs like the gospel
stomper ``Under Your Command,'' the Depression-era ballad ``The
Price of Progress,'' or Ringenberg's ode to his daughter, ``For
Addie Rose.'' But the music and Ringenberg's voice are so
good-naturedly alive that the themes, in classic Americana fashion,
are renewed.

 &HT;    Healed from injuries, new Georgia running backs starting to feel
at home
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS - New Georgia running back Musa Smith was hoping his
college career would start with a bang. What happened in June
wasn't exactly what he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, from West Perry High in Elliottsburg, Pa., suffered
severe burns when a firecracker exploded in his right hand. He
spent two days in the hospital and was forced to pull out of a high
school all-star game.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 6 feet 1, 210 pounds, was worried that the hand wouldn't
heal before the start of Georgia's preseason camp. But a family
vacation to Ocean City, Md., last month ended his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saltwater really helped the wounds recover,'' said Smith,
who has scarred fingers. ``It was really a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Donnan is hoping Smith and fellow freshman
Albert Hollis are a fountain of youth for the Bulldogs' backfield
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rushed for 2,041 yards and 32 touchdowns as a senior,
averaging more than nine yards per carry. He chose Georgia over
several schools after making a nationwide tour last summer with two
of his high-school coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, Smith and his coaches visited Florida, Georgia and
North Carolina. The following week, they traveled to Wisconsin,
Michigan State, Notre Dame and Purdue. After another trip to
Virginia Tech, West Virginia and Penn State, Smith decided he
wanted to attend Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked Penn State, but they were recruiting me as a
defensive back,'' Smith said. ``I wanted to carry the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollis, from Christian Brothers High in Sacramento, Calif.,
committed to UCLA in May 1999. When Hollis started to waiver on his
commitment to the Bruins, a high-school track coach told him he
should consider Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that I should look at Georgia because of Herschel
Walker and the great tradition of running backs they have here,''
Hollis said. ``Herschel Walker also ran track here, which is
something I really want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After a trip to Georgia's Internet web site, Hollis contacted
one of the Bulldogs' track coaches. Another telephone call to
Georgia recruiting coordinator Rodney Garner resulted in Hollis
making an official visit to Athens. He later picked the Bulldogs
over UCLA, Southern Cal, Texas, Notre Dame and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really the running back tradition here and my
relationship with Coach Garner that attracted me to Georgia,''
Hollis said. ``I just felt more comfortable at Georgia, even though
it's so far from home. This is like my home away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollis, 5 feet 11, 199 pounds, injured his left hamstring June 3
in the 100-meter finals of the California high school track
championships. Favored in the 100 meters and 200 meters, he wasn't
able to finish either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hamstring is fine,'' Hollis said. ``They're starting to
unleash me a little more. I'm getting more reps than last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollis rushed for 2,053 yards and 31 touchdowns in his final
prep season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs open Sept. 2 against Georgia Southern.

<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ Gov. George W. Bush praised his Democratic
rival's vice-presidential pick Wednesday as he prepared for a
whistle-stop tour through California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters that U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, ``was a good pick by Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Lieberman is a man who is praised by people from both
sides of the aisle,'' Bush said. That's a good sign. I don't know
him personally, but I do appreciate his strong positions on ethics
that he has taken ... I think he's a man of integrity ... ``
</P>
<P>
   Bush today begins his second whistle-stop tour in as many weeks.
This one will take him through some of the agricultural communities
dotting California's coast and Central Valley _ areas the GOP has
mostly lost in the last two presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bush traveled several Mid-Western states last week, where his
vice presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, is campaigning this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on his 7th campaign trip into California since March 7,
campaigned with wife, Laura, Wednesday. Former Republican primary
foe Arizona U.S. Sen. McCain joins him in Salinas today. They will
stop in Lodi and Stockton before a fund-raising event at the home
of San Diego Chargers owner Alex Spanos. The event is expected to
raise up to $400,000 for the California Republican Party. Before
Gore tapped Lieberman as his running mate, Bush had sought to tar
the vice president with President Clinton's scandals. Asked if that
tactic will work now that Lieberman is by Gore's side, Bush urged
voters to remember that the race is between him and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Vice President Gore wants to say, 'I'm different from
President Clinton', let him explain how. I'm saying I am ... I'm
saying we'll set a new tone.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in the coastal town of Oxnard, Bush sounded the
themes he will use to drum support among conservative Democrats and
swing voters along his route. Clinton won Ventura County, home to
Oxnard, in 1992 and 1996. An estimated 30 percent of the voters
here are considered, swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries me that we're forcing our farmers off the land in
America because of bad tax policy,'' Bush told the crowd. ``It
worries me that when a person dies in a family it forces the small
business people, or the people who toil the land, to have to sell
in order to pay the death taxes. I think in these times of plenty
... we ought to get rid of the death tax in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Repbublicans so far have been unsuccessful in their efforts to
repeal the federal estate tax, which they have dubbed the death
tax. Bush supports phasing out the tax, a theme he frequently
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush greeted his first crowd in this heavily Latino state
speaking Spanish, telling them, ``With your support I'm going to
win. With your support I'm going to be the next president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush then traveled to San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara
counties. Clinton won Santa Barabara County in the last two
elections but lost San Luis Obispo four years ago to former U.S.
Sen. Robert J. Dole, 47 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is trying to reach conservative Democrats and independents
he needs to win. About 30 percent of the voters in each of the
three counties are swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through areas that we did not do well in in 1992
or 1996, but they are areas that have a lot of swing voters and we
think Governor Bush has an opportunity to do well in this year,''
campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes told reporters aboard Bush's
plane Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Polls are tight, California leans heavily Democratic and Bush
faces a tough fight here. Despite the odds, he said he isn't
conceding.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, they said, 'Well, Republicans play like we're
going to run and then write it off,'' Bush said. ``I'm not writing
off this state.''

ECONOMY SLOWING FOR `SOFT LANDING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hard-charging US economy slowed in the late spring and early
summer, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday, suggesting a ``soft
landing'' for the 10-year expansion indeed could replace the
traditional boom-and-bust dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks indicate a downshifting
in consumer spending, manufacturing and construction in every area
of the country except St. Louis, and that energy costs have peaked.
Accordingly, the central bank almost certainly will refrain from
raising interest rates for the seventh time later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was off 71 points and the Nasdaq closed just barely in
positive territory Wednesday. Many investors already largely had
factored in the Fed staying on the sidelines through the fall,
because it would be too close to the election.
</P>
<P>
   Labor markets remained extremely tight, but in a trend that
impressed economists, increased productivity held inflation at bay.
A government report Tuesday said American productivity rose at the
fastest pace in 17 years while labor costs declined.
</P>
<P>
   Companies continued to invest in new technology to increase
efficiency, keeping a lid on wage increases and effectively
ensuring the economy did not overheat even in these later stages of
its expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The trend _ technology-driven productivity gains heading off
inflation, helping to bring about a soft landing _ was seen as the
economist's equivalent of ``The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty impressive stuff. You just don't see this, so
late in a cycle,'' said Fred Breimyer, chief economist for State
Street Corp. ``The question remains: How much of this is an
entirely new experience that transforms all the old assumptions, or
is it just a different kind of cycle? But the stamp of approval is
on this economy, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston economist Wayne Ayers agreed that ``The basic laws
of supply and demand have not been repealed.''
</P>
<P>
   If the productivity gains aren't permanent, inflationary
pressures could come right back into the picture, he said. ``But so
far, so good. And it really hasn't happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, wages and productivity conspire to derail an economic
expansion. In the early stages of an expansion, right after a
recession, employers are slow to hire until they are convinced the
recovery is for real. As a result, per-worker output is high. In
the later stages of an expansion, employers are reluctant to fire
anyone, and indeed often have trouble finding workers. That puts
upward pressure on wages and per-worker output falls off.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, employers using new technology were able to do
more with the workers they had, doing an end-run around the usual
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Latta, principal US economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI
said the nifty trick was made possible by ``an economy that has
operated more freely than it has in the past, with a lot of
competition and lot of deregulation. Unions don't have the clout
and the wage-setting role they used to have. And we have this
phenomenon in technology and communications, really changing the
way we do so many things. A lot of opportunity that remains to be
exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   Latta cited another factor allowing employers to do more with
less, in terms of the labor force: ``Businesses learned how to dumb
down the jobs. There was all this talk about needing a college
education for the new economy. But with all this technology,
instead we've just been able to dumb the jobs down.''
</P>
<P>
   If the storyline from the Fed's Beige Book (as the district
reports are known) is that technology helped productivity slow down
expansion, that would be a confirmation of Fed chairman Alan
Greenspan's view of a new kind of economy at work, many economists
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other so-called ``hawks'' at the Fed have been skeptical that
such a three-cushion shot was possible, but now ``they're all
singing from the same hymm book,'' said Ayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a completely new world, but the safe speed
limit for the economy has just been increased. It used to be, if
the economy grew faster than 3 percent, inflation was going to be a
problem. Now, the speed limit is more like 3.5 to 4 percent. Five
percent-plus, of course, is not a safe speed limit,'' Ayers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like a standoff than a real resolution,'' said State
Street's Breimyr. ``The labor markets are too tight to be sustained
indefinitely. This is not where you want to be. But those pressures
are being negated by substantial gains in productivity, and that's
enough to keep them on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they'll take a pass, for good reasons. That does not mean
they have resolved everything. We'll have to see how far this
goes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Beige Book findings will be used when the Fed's policymaking
Federal Open Market Committee next meets Aug. 22 to set US interest
rates. The Fed has raised interest rates six times since June 1999
to try to cool down the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report noted that the economy was still growing
overall, but that consumer spending, manufacturing and construction
``were slightly softer than in the last report. Easing demand
appears to be restraining prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Inflation was not kept entirely at bay. Some companies turned to
big signing bonuses to attract workers. Even fast-food chains
offered regular pay raises and profit-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers were insulated from input price increases because
of competitive pressures, the report said. Retailers in New York
and Chicago resorted to promotions and discounting.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted that venture capital funding was less
forthcoming, and slightly more scrutiny was starting to accompany
loans. Demand for credit was still robust, though home-building and
buying slowed.

&HT;     BLACK-JEWISH TENSIONS UNLIKELY TO IMPACT DEMOCRATIC TICKET 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ African-American leaders on Wednesday denounced a
Dallas NAACP official who criticized Sen. Joseph Lieberman because
of his religion.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the flap, political experts said occasional
tensions between African Americans and Jews are not likely to
depress the election turnout among blacks who traditionally vote
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas NAACP President Lee Alcorn, appearing on a local radio
show Monday, said of Vice President Al Gore's selection of
Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, as his running mate: ``I'm concerned
about, you know, any kind of Jewish candidate, you know, and I'm
concerned about the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of the Democratic Party taking the African-American
vote for granted. If we get a Jew person, then what I'm wondering
is, I mean, what is this movement for?''
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn added that, ``I think we need to be very suspicious of
any kind of partnerships between Jews at that kind of level because
we know that their interest has to do with, you know, money and
these kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP's national president, Kweisi Mfume, suspended Alcorn,
telling him in a letter Wednesday: ``I find your comments in this
matter to be repulsive. They are, in my opinion, anti-Semitic and
anti-NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume, a former House member from Maryland, said Alcorn would be
suspended until a full investigation and hearings on his statements
have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who in 1984 referred to New York
City as ``Hymietown,'' was quick to distance himself from Alcorn
and anti-Semitism. He told reporters after a White House ceremony
in which he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, that
Alcorn's statements are ``absolutely not'' representative of how
African Americans look upon Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must not assume a tree leaf is a tree,'' Jackson said,
adding that he doesn't know Alcorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to hear more expressions of darkness, but we'll
also hear some more expressions of light,'' he said. Referring to
Alcorn, he said, ``Some people are not enlightened.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he applauded the NAACP decision to suspend Alcorn
and declared that black elected officials ``are all enthusiastic''
about Lieberman for vice president, and that blacks will
``overwhelmingly'' support the Gore-Lieberman ticket.
</P>
<P>
   From its high-water mark in the 1960s when Jews played a
prominent role in helping Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other
black leaders build the civil rights movement, the relationship
between blacks and Jews has been testy at times in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan has referred to Judaism
as a ``gutter religion'' And Jackson's reference to ``Hymietown''
16 years ago was widely interpreted as representative of a growing
anti-Semitic view among American blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But political experts said they do not envision any significant
defection of African Americans from Democratic ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some negative reaction to Lieberman, but I think
it will fade over time,'' said Allan Lichtman, a historian at
American University who studies civil rights issues. ``In the end,
the very strong bridge between African Americans and the Democratic
Party will remain sturdy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live,''
Lieberman said he was unconcerned about anti-Semitism in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are so tolerant,'' he said. ``I'm
convinced that they're going to vote for me or against me, based
not on my religion but based on how they judge me as a person and
whether they think I can do this job.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, 82 percent of African American voters cast ballots for
the Clinton-Gore ticket. In 1996, 84 percent did. African Americans
also strongly supported Clinton during his impeachment proceedings
in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 35 million, blacks are 13 percent of the
U.S. population and 15 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the black vote is crucial in southern states that
have leaned increasingly to Republicans in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two years Democrats beat Republicans in
gubernatorial elections in South Carolina and Mississippi and kept
the governor's mansion in Democratic hands in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks were critical to those victories,'' said Earl Black, a
political scientist at Rice University who studies minority voting
patterns. ``The underlying structure in southern states is that
Democrats don't need the majority of whites to win where they have
significant black voter turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lublin, a political scientist at American University here,
asked if the Lieberman selection might diminish that turnout,
replied, ``Obviously a black vice presidential nominee would have
upped it, but it's hard to see how a Jewish nominee would depress
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lublin, who is Jewish, added, ``Most Jews tend to view
themselves as different from other whites, but most African
Americans view Jews as part of the great expanse of whites in this
countries. So I doubt that the nomination of Lieberman will do
anything to undercut black Democratic support.''
</P>
<P>
   At last week's Republican National Convention, GOP nominee
George W. Bush emphasized inclusiveness and diversity, inviting
retired Army Gen. Colin Powell and foreign policy expert
Condoleezza Rice to address delegates in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not appear that Bush's effort to reach out to
minorities has won him much black support. A USA Today/CNN/Gallup
poll immediately after the convention found that while Bush
expanded his lead over Gore to 17 points _ 54 percent to 37 percent
_ Gore led Bush among black voters by 58 points _ 71 percent to 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of blacks said the Democratic Party best represents
their values.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer issued a
statement condemning Alcorn. ``When it comes to fighting
anti-Semitism, Governor Bush and (former Defense) Secretary (Dick)
Cheney stand shoulder to shoulder with all Americans in condemning
such foolish utterances,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jewish voters represent 2.2 percent of the population and 3
percent of the electorate. In the last two presidential elections,
78 percent of Jewish voters cast their ballots for the Clinton-Gore
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are an important bloc in places such as New York, where
they are 10 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   While Jewish leaders express dismay over instances of black
anti-Semitism, polls suggest Jewish voters do not view African
Americans as being particularly anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll last year of 1,000 Jewish voters conducted by the New
York-based American Jewish Committee, respondents were asked to
rank groups in terms of anti-Semitism. Twenty-three percent
identified the religious right as the most anti-Semitic. Next came
the Muslims, with 21 percent of Jewish voters identifying them as
the most anti-Semitic. Seven percent named African Americans as the
most anti-Semitic.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The company that makes Firestone tires said on
Thursday that the treads on millions of tires it has produced since
1991 seem unusually prone to fly off, sometimes with catastrophic
results.
</P>
<P>
   Facing 50 lawsuits, 46 deaths, 80 injuries and a federal
investigation, the company said it would replace free the 6.5
million tires still on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But the company, Bridgestone/Firestone, said that some vehicle
owners might have to wait a year to get the new tires, even though
the company will buy competitors' tires to meet the demands that
the recall will create. In fact, some consumers seeking
replacements today were turned away by dealers, the supply already
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the tires in question came new on sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks made by Ford over the past
decade. The recall will begin in Southern states, the company said,
because the failures seem related to hot weather. But they added
that they did not know why the tires seemed particularly vulnerable
to the failures.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said the tires that they had been able to
examine showed signs of underinflation, or overloading, exterior
damage from road debris, improper repair or other abuse or flaw,
but acknowledged that all tires produced by all manufacturers are
subject to those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled tires are ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires for
15-inch wheels, with a size designation that is P235/75R15. All
such ATX and ATX II tires are being recalled, but only those
Wilderness AT tires that also have a Transportation Department
10-digit designation starting with the letters VD are being
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that the company could not explain, all the
Wilderness tires made at its plant in Decatur, Ill. _ the ones
designated VD _ seem prone to failure, along with ATX and ATX II
tires made in several plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not identified any manufacturing or design defect,''
Gary B. Crigger, executive vice president of the company, said at a
news conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pulling this size now, rather than try to figure out
what the answer is,'' Crigger said. The company has not had time to
``do the forensics'' on tires in accidents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agreed, however, on the likely mechanism for the
failure: heat, generated by tire sidewalls that flex excessively
because there is too little air in the tire, or too much weight on
the vehicle. The problem is probably aggravated by hot pavement and
air temperatures, according to company officials and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co. said on Wednesday that it first became aware
of the problem a year ago, with ``anecdotal reports'' from Saudi
Arabia, where drivers let air out of the tires to drive on the
desert, then returned to paved roads and drove at high speeds
without reinflating the tires.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone, which is the American unit of the
Bridgestone Corp. of Japan, acted in the United States on Wednesday
after extensive discussions with the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration and Ford, which took about two-thirds of the
tires in question for installation on sport utility vehicles and
pickups. The deputy head of the safety administration, Rosalyn G.
Millman, said in a statement that she was pleased that Firestone
``has taken a positive step toward resolving this safety issue.''
But a spokesman for the agency, Rae Tyson, said that its
investigation had begun only in May and that the agency did not
know enough now to order a recall.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said the agency had begun its inquiry primarily because of
an increasing number of complaints from consumers to its hot line
and that in recent days, as news reports had cited the problem, the
number of complaints had risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from 21 deaths to 46 just last week,'' he said. ``I
don't think anyone would want us to jump to any conclusions based
on an investigation that just began.'' A key question for
investigators looking into cases in which vehicles rolled over and
had damaged tires is whether the tires were the cause, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics said the government response had been slow.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook, a former administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration and now director of Public Citizen, a
consumer rights group, said that ``the first lawsuits they settled
were back in 1992, and they've known about this for years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They settled them with gag orders,'' Claybrook said. ``This
has been a big cover-up for years.'' And the safety agency has had
weak leadership and been preoccupied with other issues, she said,
including faulty rear door latches on minivans and sidesaddle gas
tanks on pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Crigger, of Firestone, said that the company was faced with 50
lawsuits. Asked on Wednesday if non-disclosure clauses in the
settlement agreements were intended to cover up the problem,
Crigger said, ``I don't know about the status'' of such clauses.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the suits, one question at issue is whether the
suspension, which Ford designed, is partly responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Claybrook said that the problem echoed the problem with
Firestone 500 tires, which surfaced in 1978, when she was the
administrator. That case was a severe financial blow to Firestone
and was one reason it was acquired by Bridgestone in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Of the tires in Wednesday's announcement, about two-thirds came
new on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, and Ranger and F-150
pickup trucks, Mercury Mountaineer SUVs, as well as Mazda Navajo
and B-series pickups. All were produced between 1991 and 2000. But
millions of other tires were sold as replacements. GM and Subaru,
two other manufacturers that use Firestone for original equipment
tires, said they had not had any reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, in fact, may be related in part to the vehicle,
although statistics were sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   Tire failure in an Explorer may be a bigger problem than in
other vehicles, said David A. Champion, the director of auto
testing for Consumer Reports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``SUV's are more prone to roll over than other classes of
vehicles because of the high center of gravity,'' Champion said.
Thus a tire failure that causes an accident in an SUV ``can be more
dramatic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford stood by its longtime supplier on Wednesday _ Henry Ford
and Harvey Firestone were friends and business associates nearly a
century ago _ but the company gave slightly different advice to
owners of Explorers that have the tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said to keep the tires inflated to 26-30 pounds per square
inch, and Firestone said 30. And while Ford has had what it called
``anecdotal reports'' of a problem for a year, a Ford executive
complained on Wednesday that it had taken until late last month to
get Firestone to turn over data on its warranty experience with the
tires provided on new Fords. (Manufacturers use warranty complaints
to track defects, but the warranties on tires are customarily
separate from cars.)

S. Lewinsky. And he's good friends with the Republican's prominent
morals monitor, former Education Secretary Bill Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator's record, at least in part, seems to
support many things his running-mate, Vice President Al Gore, has
fought against.
</P>
<P>
   And while the two men insisted again and again Wednesday that
they are closely aligned on most everything, the newly minted
Democratic ticket was on the defensive when asked about their
differing opinions on key campaign issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to have a vice president who disagrees with me
on some issues,'' said Gore, putting a reassuring arm around
Lieberman's shoulder as the two responded to questions at a ``town
meeting'' in Gore's home town.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the vice president insisted, he would be the one to set
the agenda in the White House _ not Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   On their first full campaign day together, the Democratic duo
made hometown visits to Gore's birthplace here, where Gore showed
Lieberman around his family's estate. Later, the two appeared at a
rally in Lieberman's home town of Stamford, Conn., where the
senator received the warm welcome of a returning local hero.
</P>
<P>
   In Carthage, a local teacher asked Gore and Lieberman what they
would do about education vouchers, a tax break that helps parents
of private school students and which is strongly supported by
Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has supported the plan in some cases, but ``our
administration will be opposed to private school vouchers,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and I stand shoulder to shoulder,'' Lieberman piped
in.
</P>
<P>
   While the two men may disagree in private, ``when President Gore
decides, believe me, Vice President Lieberman will support him
whole-heartedly,'' Lieberman added.
</P>
<P>
   The two also have some differences on abortion, always a thorny
campaign issue. Lieberman told the ``Today'' show he favors a law
requiring parental consent for minors seeking abortions. His
spokesman, Dan Gerstein, said Lieberman would insist on a judicial
bypass provision, under which a judge could allow the abortion over
the parent's objections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, is opposed to all parental notification laws. He
told reporters on Air Force Two that he would, however, favor a
parental notification law that allowed a doctor or judge to offer a
waiver of the notification in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed on issues probably much more than any other two
senators you can find from different regions of the country,'' Gore
said. The campaign downplayed the men's disagreements, saying it
was a Republican effort to denigrate the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot voucher program Lieberman has supported is ``a very
small part of his education agenda,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who participated in civil rights marches in the
'60s,'' Lehane said, emphasizing Lieberman's more traditionally
Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieberman's approach to vouchers has been experimental,'' said
Greg Simon, a senior advisor to the campaign, and is in great
contrast to the proposal by Republican nominee George W. Bush, who
wants to ``abandon public education.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Lieberman, a centrist Democrat who is more
conservative than Gore on a number of issues, is likely to help the
Democrats woo America's political middle. But Gore risks losing the
more liberal base of the Democratic party, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   That threat would be less troublesome were it not for the
presence of consumer advocate Ralph Nader in the presidential race.
Nader is drawing about four to five percent of the vote nationally,
and if disaffected liberals decide to go for Nader, Gore would lose
critical percentage points that could decide the election,
political consultants note.
</P>
<P>
   ``By choosing Senator Lieberman, they have now left Ralph Nader
completely open on the left,'' said Rich Bond, who advises
Republican campaigns. ``There is no progressive voice to hold Ralph
Nader back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was not the candidate of choice for some liberal
constituencies. The senator has been a sharp critic of Hollywood,
saying that the entertainment industry is making it hard ``to raise
PG children in an X-rated society.'' He also has argued for tort
reform, angering trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time election day arrives, liberals may be forced to
back the Gore-Lieberman ticket, since the Republican alternative is
so potentially damaging to their agendas, noted Stuart Rothenberg,
author of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he's a (centrist) Democratic Leadership Council
Democrat, I don't think that will make liberal Democrats walk,''
Rothenberg said. ``They may not prefer his selection; they may
think he doesn't go far enough. But faced with George W. Bush (as
an alternative), they'll stay relatively loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has had a mixed record, for example, on gay rights.
The senator has opposed gay marriages and was a backer of the 1996
Defense of Marriage Act, which allows states to disregard gay
marriages recognized by other states.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``we're totally on board,'' said David Smith, spokesman
for the Human Rights Campaign, the country's leading gay rights
group. Lieberman did support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act,
which prohibits job discrimination against gays, Smith noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see him energizing traditional left in a very positive
way,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hollywood is not likely to make a big fuss about Lieberman,
and the community is not big enough to make an electoral impact in
California, said Bill Carrick, a California Democratic political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right on all the issues here,'' where Gore is already
leading by some 10 percentage points in most polls, Carrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's choice did draw some derisive comments from Dallas
civil rights leader Lee Alcorn, who told a radio show host Monday
that he was ``concerned about, you know, any kind of Jewish
candidate,'' and that he was ``sick of the Democratic Party taking
the African-American vote for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were quickly denounced by Kweisi Mfume, head of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, as
``repulsive'' and ``anti-Semitic.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer historical breakthrough of being the first Jew to run
for vice president on a major party ticket may galvanize some
liberals who don't necessarily approve of Lieberman's legislative
agenda, said Frank Mankiewicz, who worked for liberals Robert F.
Kennedy and George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore-Lieberman campaign, if they're smart, will instill
some guilt in liberals for not supporting them,'' Mankiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's selection ``did instantly turn off a lot of the
traditional base of the Democratic party,'' Mankiewicz said. ``But
I suspect they'll come back.''

BC-BS TO LEVEL PHYSICIAN FEE PLAYING FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts _ the
state's largest health insurer _ will adopt new physician fees next
month that reduce payments to many surgeons and specialists and put
more money into the pockets of general practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   Many Massachusetts doctors, already unhappy about shrinking fees
and rising expenses, see the move as the latest blow to their
incomes and predict the action will make it be harder to attract
top doctors to the state and could increase patient waits for
certain services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting here right now with my accountant trying to do a
budget,'' said Dr. Francis VanHouten, a radiologist who has
practiced 27 years. ``We're looking at a 5 to 10 percent decrease
in reimbursement for our group. It's difficult to imagine how we
can continue to provide these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials say the new fees reflect a national trend
toward paying doctors more equitably. For years Medicare, the
federal health insurance program for the elderly, has believed that
reimbursement rates for specialists are too high, and that general
practioners fees are too low.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be debates about whether this is
fair,'' said Dr. William Winkenwerder, executive vice president of
health care services for Blue Cross. ``But because this payment
method has been supported by a large number of physicians, we do
think it's equitable and the best approach anyone has come up with
so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the fee plan, set to take effect September 1, radiologists
will face a particularly hefty cut. Blue Cross will lower the fee
it pays doctors to read screening mammographies _ routine
mammographies given to healthy women _ by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Radiologists said the insurer will lower the fee for screening
mammographies to within a few cents of Medicare, which pays about
$21.50 per x-ray.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear whether lower fees for doctors will impact
patients, VanHouten said some colleagues have told him say they'll
stop providing the service, which may increase waits for routine
mammographies. VanHouten said he would continue to provide the
screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Yael Miller, director of health systems for the Massachusetts
Medical Society, which represents the state's physicians, said
anesthesiologists, radiologists and neurosurgeons will be hardest
hit under the new pay scale. Pediatricians, internists and family
practitioners will see their fees rise.
</P>
<P>
   How hard a doctor is hit by the new Blue Cross fees depends not
only on her specialty but on whether she practices in a hospital or
a private office, the mix of services she provides and how many of
her patients are covered by the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   For example, obstetricians said their fee for seeing a woman
through pregnancy and delivering her baby are being reduced 5
percent, or by about $100.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Raskauskas, an obstetrician, said the new Blue Cross
fees are significantly lower than those of most other insurers he
works for. ``Not a good scenario for you or us,'' he recently wrote
a Blue Cross executive.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross's fee scale is based on a national model adopted by
Medicare, which began changing how it pays doctors in 1992 and
restructured fees again in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Under Medicare, the changes mean that heart surgeons, for
example, will see their fees fall 12 percent over four years, while
dermatologists will be handed a 20 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Private insurers often follow Medicare's lead, although they are
not required to do so. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts
began to implement the Medicare model last year, but the fees
scheduled to take effect next month are the most significant
changes yet.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts specialists say that the specific way Blue Cross
plans to implement the next step of the fee program will make the
impact here worse than under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare assigns each of the 8,000 services performed by doctors
a ``relative value unit'' depending on the time and intensity of
the service. The relative value is then multiplied by a dollar
amount called a ``conversion factor,'' which is supposed to
increase each year for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts specialists said they don't disagree with
assigning each service a relative value. But they said that the
``conversion factor'' Blue Cross is using is too low, and puts its
fees only slightly above Medicare's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to recruit high quality physicians and
reimburse them competitively,'' VanHouten said. ``They can make
significantly more in Florida and Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross executives said it's true that many specialists will
see their fees reduced, but that on average the physicians in the
Blue Cross network will receive fee increases. Those increases are
4.1 percent for the company's managed care plans, or HMOs, and 6.8
percent for traditional fee-for-service.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross, which insures nearly 2 million Massachusetts
residents, accounts for between 10 and 25 percent of the income of
the 14,000 doctors in the network.
</P>
<P>
   VanHouten, a former president of the Massachusetts Medical
Society, said he called Blue Cross executives three weeks ago.
``Our only leverage is morale persuasion,'' he said. ``They're in
control at this point. All we can hope is that they're reasonable
men.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologists and radiologists said they do not want
``unseemly'' fighting with primary care doctors over scarce health
care dollars but think Blue Cross should raise the fees for all
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure primary care is going up,'' said Dr. John Patti, a
radiologist. ``But they're going up from levels that are so low to
begin with. As a specialist, I would support them being raised an
appropriate level.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that doctors are well aware that the public believes
they're overpaid to begin with. But, she said, that's a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The everyday practicing physician is more hassled and working
longer hours and has less social time and less family time than
ever before,'' she said. ``Patients are surprised with the waits
they have. Physicians try as hard as they can to conceal the
problems from patients, but I believe it's starting to bubble up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, physicians earned on average $164,000 in 1997, down
from $166,000 the prior year, according to the most recent figures
from the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross executives said they are merely trying to be
competitive, and not pay doctors less _ or more _ than other
insurers in the market, including Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard some feedback from physicians,'' Winkenwerder
said. ``People are kind of scurrying about to see if their
particular interests or concerns are being addressed. But the
changes we've made have generally been well received.''

 UNDATED: babies' organs.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The software, normally used to study brain tumors in adults, had
never been applied to the tiny structures inside fetuses before,
and it took 70 to 80 hours of work to interpret the images and
create the models, Tempany estimated. Eventually, they determined
that the vital organs were normal; the girls' livers were fused,
but surgeons would be able to divide them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, additional studies also confirmed that not even a
heart transplant would save the second twin, because she was
missing major blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to hook a heart into,'' Fishman said, adding
that in any case, newborn donor hearts are virtually impossible to
find.
</P>
<P>
   As sad as the situation was, both Fishman and the Sotos noted
that it freed them from the ethical and moral quandary they would
have faced if they themselves had to choose one twin over the
other, or to decide between a good chance of saving one versus a
smaller chance of saving both.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no decision points,'' Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the second twin could not survive, Fishman planned to
make his incisions as much as possible to her side of the bridge
linking her to her sister, to spare the twin who would live and
also to provide the ribs, skin and tissue needed to cover the large
opening that would be left in her chest and abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Soto said that although the couple had been told that only one
baby would survive, reality did not sink in until Fishman gathered
them and other family members together in a conference room at the
hospital and drew a detailed diagram of the proposed surgery on a
blackboard. He finished by marking a large X over the outline of
the twin who would die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cried,'' Mr. Soto said. ``I guess until then we thought God
was going to put a little heart in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when he saw the family in tears, Fishman said later, did he
feel sure that they understood that only one of their daughters
could survive.
</P>
<P>
   The couple chose names for both babies and made plans to bury
one, who would be called Sandra Ivellise, in a family plot in
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, doctors and the family worried that both babies might
die even before they were born. Their circulatory condition, called
a TRAP sequence, for ``twin-reversed arterial perfusion,''
sometimes occurs in twins who are not conjoined but who have only
one heart. In those cases, the twin with the heart, referred to as
the ``pump twin,'' can die from heart failure induced by the strain
of pumping blood to its sibling. When the TRAP condition is
diagnosed in non-conjoined twins, doctors can operate on the
fetuses to cut off the blood supply to the second twin, which is
usually not fully developed anyway. The second twin dies, but the
twin with the heart is saved.
</P>
<P>
   But that procedure cannot be done if the twins are conjoined, as
the Soto babies were, because the death of one will kill the other
as well.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Soto's pregnancy progressed, fluid began to accumulate
in one of the twins' chests, a sign of heart failure. Doctors
feared the babies would be lost, but somehow the condition
resolved. A Caesarean delivery and immediate surgery for the babies
were planned for the first week of June.
</P>
<P>
   But at 7:00 a.m. on May 30, Mrs. Soto's obstetricians called
Fishman with alarming news. She had developed a disorder called
preeclampsia, and her blood pressure was so high she was at risk of
having a stroke . She needed a Caesarean immediately, the
obstetrician said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do that, the babies will die,'' Fishman said. He
pleaded for time to assemble his operating-room team, about 20
people. The obstetricians gave him 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The team gathered, and Fishman stood by in the delivery room at
Brigham and Women's Hospital, waiting to rush the babies through
the corridors to Children's Hospital, which is next door.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said later, he was unprepared for the emotional impact
of seeing two live babies, and knowing that soon there would be
only one. ``As much as we spent months planning for this, and it
seemed ethically and emotionally simple, nevertheless when I saw
them both initially pink and both crying and moving their arms and
having the same size bodies, it was heart wrenching,'' Fishman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Soto saw his daughters in the delivery room, but, he said,
he was afraid to touch them. Mrs. Soto, fearing that neither baby
would live, said she could not bear to see them.
</P>
<P>
   As the doctors had predicted, Sandra, who lacked a heart, began
to fail almost immediately when the cord was cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to see things change before our eyes,'' said Dr.
Errol Norwitz, part of the obstetrical team. ``She became cool, and
very pale.'' Her blood pressure was too low to measure, she lacked
a pulse and she was not getting enough oxygen. It was urgent that
she be separated from her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeons had to move quickly,'' he said. ``It got a little
hairy then.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies were given anesthesia, put on ventilators and whisked
off to the operating room. The surgery went smoothly; the most
wrenching moment occurred about two thirds of the way through the
procedure, Fishman said, when the twins were physically separated
at last, and it was time to take Sandra's body away.
</P>
<P>
   But Darielis survived. She spent 6 months in the hospital and
required more operations to repair a heart defect and an intestinal
obstruction. She also needed physical therapy and a brace to help
straighten her spine, which was curved backward from her cramped
position in the womb. And for her first year she had a bulge in her
chest the size of an adult's fist, created by a rib cage that
Fishman had constructed from Sandra's tissue and bone to protect
Darielis' heart, which at first did not fit into her chest. But
recent surgery has smoothed the bulge, and she looks completely
normal, with surprisingly faint scarring and a remarkably sunny
disposition, considering all she has been through.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Soto is expecting another baby, a girl, due in November.
But the family has not forgotten the daughter they lost. They hope
to visit Sandra's grave in Puerto Rico soon.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they would eventually tell Darielis about her
beginnings, Mr. and Mrs. Soto answered simultaneously, ``La
verdad.'' The truth.

PRISON POPULATION GREW AT LOWEST RATE SINCE 1979, JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., La., Minn., Pa.)   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After an eight-year drop in crime, the population of the
nation's state and federal prisons grew last year at the lowest
rate since 1979, 3.4 percent, the Justice Department reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The main reasons the prison population has increased even as
crime has declined, the report said, are that the number of inmates
returned to prison for parole violations increased, the length of
the average sentence rose, and drug crimes, which are not included
in the overall crime rate computed by the FBI, did not drop.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 54 percent growth in the number of inmates returned
to prison after being released on parole during the 1990s, as
parole agents became tougher about revoking parole for technical
violations like failing a drug test. By contrast, there was only a
7 percent increase in the number of criminals sent to prison for
new convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The average length of time served in prison was 28 months in
1998, up from 20 months in 1990, according to the report, the
result of tougher sentencing laws.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that the total number of Americans in all
jails and prisons crossed the 2 million mark for the first time,
reaching, 2,026,596 at the end of 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that Texas, which has been on a
record-setting prison expansion under Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential candidate, passed California as the state
with the most prison inmates, though Texas has a much smaller
population, 20 million people compared with 32 million in
California. At the end of 1999, Texas had 163,190 inmates and
California, 163,067. California had long had the biggest prison
system in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had the second highest rate of incarceration per capita,
762 per 100,000, trailing Louisiana, with 776 per 100,000. That
gave Texas an incarceration rate six times higher than Minnesota,
the lowest state, with 125 inmates per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report said that 9.4 percent of black men ages
25 to 29 were in state and federal prisons in 1999, almost 10 times
the rate for white men in their late twenties, which was 1.0
percent. Among Hispanic males in their late twenties, 3.1 percent
were in prison.
</P>
<P>
   While the report highlighted the racial disparities in prison,
it contradicted a frequent claim of advocates of prison and drug
sentencing reform, who say most prisoners are locked up for drug
arrests. In fact, the Justice Department found, people who had been
convicted of violent crimes accounted for 51 percent of the
increase in state prison populations between 1990 and 1998. Drug
offenses accounted for 19 percent of the increase, property crimes
accounted for 15 percent, and various other crimes accounted for 15
percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Altogether, in 1998, there were 545,200 state prison inmates
serving time for violent offenses _ including murder, robbery,
assault and rape _ compared to 242,900 for property crimes _
including burglary, auto theft and fraud _ and 236,800 for drug
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Where prisoners sentenced for drug crimes do predominate, the
report said, is in the federal prison system. Of the 108,925
federal inmates in 1998, 30,470 were sentenced for drug crimes,
compared with 9,557 for violent crimes and 7,935 for property
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University,
said a major finding of the study, written by Allen J. Beck of the
Bureau of Justice Statistics, was that the continued growth of the
prison population was driven by the huge increase in the number of
parolees being returned to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The report says most of those returning parolees have committed
new crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumstein said the parole system had gotten tougher and more
parolees were being returned for violations like failing a monthly
urine test for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.4 percent increase in inmates in state and federal prisons
in 1999 _ to 1.37 million _ was well below the average annual
growth rate during the 1990s, of 6.5 percent, the new report said.
The growth rate hit a high of 8.7 percent in 1994, well after the
crime wave of the late 1980s and early 1990s began to decline in
1991, falling gradually for the rest of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   One major issue that the new study did not address is whether
there is any relationship between growth in the incarceration rate
and the drop in crime. Advocates of tougher prosecution and
sentencing say the huge growth in imprisonment, with the
incarceration rate quadrupling since 1980, has been largely
responsible for the decrease in crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumstein said crime rates were also going up sharply in the
late 1980s when prison population was increasing as well. Some
other factors that must also be considered, he said, were the
improved economy in the 1990s, better police tactics and the waning
of the crack cocaine epidemic.

NOT `DEMENTED' ENOUGH FOR WATERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another good John Waters idea in search of a decent script and
direction, ``Cecil B. Demented'' presents a manifesto for
unfettered personal filmmaking. I suppose the joke is that this
very personal Waters production, like the guerrilla cineastes it
depicts, displays a laughable lack of craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of the Baltimore satirist's pictures, ``C.B.''
revels in ``outrageous'' prankishness that is actually pretty pale
in comparison to his '70s trash masterpieces ``Pink Flamingos,''
``Female Trouble'' and ``Desperate Living.'' It's also a
celebration of campy bad acting, which too is a yawn. The one
glorious exception to that here is Melanie Griffith, who almost
redeems the whole, tossed-off mess with one of her sharpest comic
performances in years.
</P>
<P>
   She plays Honey Whitlock, a shrewish Hollywood actress who
visits the City of Crabs for the charity premiere of her latest
commercial monstrosity. The event is hijacked by the self-styled
C.B. (Stephen Dorff) and his merry band of movie-loving terrorists,
The Sprocket Holes. A mixed bag of satanists, mama's boys, ex-porn
stars and sexually confused marginals, the Holes have all tattooed
auteurs' names on themselves and taken vows of celibacy to cinema _
at least until they finish shooting the movie C.B. forces the
kidnapped Honey to star in.
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, these kids don't have a very easy time
managing some substantial pent-up rage. The violent
verite-within-the-film recounts a series of raids on multiplexes
and runaway production locations (for the Baltimore-set ``Gump
Again,'' Forrest tells his bus bench neighbor that life is like a
crab cake) where Hollywood pablum dominates. ``We are the ultimate
bad review!'' the zealots cry before opening fire. The best bit is
when art-hating family film advocates respond so angrily to their
provocations that the Holes must run for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, of course, Honey comes around to the logic of C.B.'s
poison love for good cinema, and her performances in the raid
footage grows correspondingly more heartfelt. Any similarities to
the Patty Hearst nightmare are entirely intentional; a Waters
favorite, the kidnaped heiress turned brainwashed revolutionary has
a small role here as an uncomprehending mother.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to report that a similar Stockholm Syndrome
effect takes hold when you're trapped in a theater with ``Cecil B.
Demented.'' But whenever Waters starts to bring us around to an
acute appreciation of his disdain for mainstream movies, he
undermines the effect with stupid sexual humor, uninspired sight
gags or excessive actor whining. What could have been a bracing
attack on everything that's wrong with our current film culture, or
at least a funny spoof of directorial megalomania as a
cult-building phenomenon, ends up childishly underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   A little more fully grown, full-blown dementia wouldn't have
hurt. &QL;

SEC INSIDE INFORMATION RULE BRINGS STRONG REACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's an idea that doesn't sound very controversial: make sure
all investors have a chance to learn about significant developments
inside public companies at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But it causing an uproar. Proposed rules that would mandate just
that have generated about 6,000 public comments to the US
Securities and Exchange Commission, which is scheduled to vote on
the matter Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no formal SEC count of such things, but officials say
it is close to a record, if not an actual high water mark in terms
of public reaction to a commission proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of those messages were written by people like
Peter Schaeffer of Amagansett, N.Y., uring the SEC to level the
playing field for individual investors. ``It is nonsensical for
Wall Street analysts to have exclusive access to information,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared as of Wednesday the commission was leaning his way
on the proposal, which has been pushed hard by chairman Arthur
Levitt as the way to cleanse a ``stain on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``stain'' is more commonly known as ``selective
disclosure,'' communication by public companies to a group of
analysts, big institutional investors or others who get more
insight earlier than everyone else on business developments.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't happen all the time, but often enough to become a
cloud over a stock market that serves more individual investors
than ever before. Sound reasonable?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. There is a powerful group of institutions and
organizations who have lined up in opposition to parts or all of
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Their message: nice idea, but it would actually have a chilling
effect on the flow of information from public companies to public
markets. Unsure when they were stepping over a line, executives
would instead take the easy way out and just clam up.
</P>
<P>
   There is an element of truth to many of their comments and
evidence suggests they have moved the SEC's staff to revise the
actual proposal around the edges, probably for the better.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to miss the fact that all the barking has come
from organizations that benefit from the clubby elements of capital
markets. They include investment bankers, brokerage industry
leaders, big institutional investors, corporate investor relations
executives and even the business press. Every one of them has money
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural for those who have advantages to want to keep
them,'' said Harvey Goldschmid, a former SEC general counsel who is
the architect of the commission's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the proposal is fair and will create a much better world
for investors and avoid areas of selective disclosure perversity,''
said Goldschmid, who now teaches at Columbia University. ``By that
I mean the selective providing of information that has been used to
mitigate criticism by analysts and temper their ability to fairly
evaluate managements and companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives from 15 big investment banking firms and brokerages
signed a comment letter from the Securities Industry Association
urging the commission to ditch the rule proposal and instead employ
Washington's preferred method of killing unwelcome populist ideas:
appoint a ``blue ribbon panel'' to talk it to death.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Boston's Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill, a full-service
brokerage and investment banking firm, wrote separately that hte
SEC would be playing into the dangers an Internet brokerage boom
that has made it easier for individuals to lose their shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC proposal ``may blunt one edge enjoyed by professional
investors but, possessed with more time and more resources, the
pros will develop others,'' wrote John Adams. ``The only result
will be to encourage individuals to continue to play a game in
which the odds are stacked against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Investor Relations Institute published the results
of a poll on Monday suggesting that most corporate executives would
cut back on communications with all investors if the SEC proposal
was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Janus Capital Corp., the mutual fund company that has chalked up
huge investment gains and new money from happy mutual fund
customers thanks to its high-tech stock picking, complained the
proposal could ``stem an important and wholly appropriate flow of
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Fidelity Investments wrote the SEC to beef that its
money market analysts might not be able to do their duty to insure
the creditworthiness of investments if information dries up.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dow Jones, owner of the Wall Street Journal and other
publications, objected to the proposal because it would make
routine interviews impossible and the media was in the business of
broadly dissmenating news to the public in the first place.
(Competitor Bloomberg News drolly suggested Dow Jones was simply
trying to protect the Journal's pipeline of merger news leaks).
</P>
<P>
   It seems Dow Jones made headway. Corporate coversations with the
business press appear to have been written out of the proposed
rule. Ditto talk with suppliers, contractors and securities-rating
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is the communication between senior managers and
stock analysts and insitutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably true that companies will be anxious about
distinguishing between comments that trigger public disclosure
requirements and otherwise harmless corporate talk.
</P>
<P>
   But those kinds of problems have a way of working themselves out
in real-world application over time. The inconvenice is a small
price to pay for a stronger sense of transparency in a stock market
that can use it.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sandra and Ramon Soto, a couple in their 20s from Puerto
Rico, called Children's Hospital in Boston last year, it was to
seek help for a desperate accident of nature. Mrs. Soto, a special
education teacher, was pregnant with twins. But the two tiny girls
were fused at the chest and abdomen, locked in the classic embrace
of Siamese twins. And only one had a heart.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Puerto Rico and even the Sotos' own families had
urged Mrs. Soto to end the pregnancy, but the couple, deeply
religious and eager to have children, rejected that advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to fight for our babies,'' said Mr. Soto.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a medical odyssey, part adventure and
part ordeal, for the determined young couple and teams of doctors
who helped them, from two Boston hospitals and half a dozen medical
specialties.
</P>
<P>
   It soon became clear that one of the infants was doomed and that
it would take complex surgery _ meticulously planned and perfectly
performed immediately after the babies' birth _ to save the other.
Over the next few months, the doctors planned an eight-hour
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan nearly became useless when Mrs. Soto suddenly
developed life-threatening high blood pressure. Pediatric surgeons
pleaded with her obstetricians to delay an emergency Caesarean
section for even 90 minutes, so they could to summon the team to
operate on the babies.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the gamble worked. Today the surviving baby girl is
a healthy 14-month old, with huge brown eyes and an impish grin,
living with her parents in Paterson, N.J. Her name is Darielis
Milagro _ Milagro for ``miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Her care cost more than half a million dollars, with portions
paid by Medicaid programs in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and the
rest absorbed by the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The unique operation, performed in May 1999, was not disclosed
publicly at the time but is being described Thursday in the New
England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Steven Fishman and a team of
eight pediatric heart specialists, obstetricians and radiologists
from Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital, where
the babies were delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Soto decided to talk publicly about their
experiences because, Mr. Soto said, ``We want other parents with
this problem to try to save their kids.'' During an interview at
his home, Mr. Soto spoke with a reporter in both English and
Spanish and translated for his wife when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after learning that their daughters were conjoined and
sharing one heart, the Sotos decided to seek help outside Puerto
Rico, because they became convinced that doctors there had nothing
to offer but abortion. Mr. Soto, who had seen a television program
about Children's Hospital, called the hospital from the couple's
home in Manati, a city west of San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish-speaking translator at the hospital referred them to
Dr. Steven Fishman, a pediatric surgeon, who said he would try to
help them.
</P>
<P>
   During the Sotos' first visit to Boston, a fetal echocardiogram
revealed an abnormality that had never before been reported in
conjoined twins: a circulatory disorder in which the twin with the
heart pumped blood to the other through the umbilical cord. The
condition meant that cutting the cord, normally a happy event in
the delivery room, would kill both babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would die, and that would result in the death of the
other, since they're essentially a single organism,'' said Dr. Mary
van der Velde, director of fetal echocardiography at Children's
Hospital, who diagnosed the circulatory disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors realized that the only hope would be surgery to separate
the twins as soon as they were born. But they knew that at best
they would be able to save only one baby, the one with the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be either zero or one,'' said Fishman. ``There was no
way that they could stay attached and live, or be separated and
both live. And we knew that we would have very little time to
separate them once the cord was cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Conjoined twins are rare, occurring in 1 in 30,000 to 1 in
100,000 births. Many have serious defects in addition to being
conjoined; some do not survive, and in some cases parents choose
abortion. Sets of conjoined twins who do come to term may develop
quite differently, and each operation to separate them has its own
problems. Conjoined twins with a single heart have been born
before, but often the hearts have been abnormal, and few babies
have survived. There have been no reported cases of conjoined twins
with the Sotos' circulatory disorder, Fishman said, though cases
may have occurred but gone undiagnosed, with the fetuses dying at
birth or in the womb, or being aborted.
</P>
<P>
   Most conjoined twins are separated weeks or months after they
are born, to give them a chance to grow and become strong enough to
survive surgery, and to let doctors study their anatomy and plan
the operation. But these twins would need surgery immediately after
birth if even one was to survive. So doctors began planning while
they were still in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what internal organs were present, and whether any
were joined, two radiologists, Dr. Clare Tempany and Dr. Lennox
Hoyte performed magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI examinations,
and used software to assemble the images into a three-dimensional
model showing the babies' organs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The software, normally used to study brain tumors in adults, had
never been applied to the tiny structures inside fetuses before,
and it took 70 to 80 hours of work to interpret the images and
create the models, Tempany estimated. Eventually, they determined
that the vital organs were normal; the girls' livers were fused,
but surgeons would be able to divide them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, additional studies also confirmed that not even a
heart transplant would save the second twin, because she was
missing major blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to hook a heart into,'' Fishman said, adding
that in any case, newborn donor hearts are virtually impossible to
find.
</P>
<P>
   As sad as the situation was, both Fishman and the Sotos noted
that it freed them from the ethical and moral quandary they would
have faced if they themselves had to choose one twin over the
other, or to decide between a good chance of saving one versus a
smaller chance of saving both.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no decision points,'' Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the second twin could not survive, Fishman planned to
make his incisions as much as possible to her side of the bridge
linking her to her sister, to spare the twin who would live and
also to provide the ribs, skin and tissue needed to cover the large
opening that would be left in her chest and abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Soto said that although the couple had been told that only one
baby would survive, reality did not sink in until Fishman gathered
them and other family members together in a conference room at the
hospital and drew a detailed diagram of the proposed surgery on a
blackboard. He finished by marking a large X over the outline of
the twin who would die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cried,'' Mr. Soto said. ``I guess until then we thought God
was going to put a little heart in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when he saw the family in tears, Fishman said later, did he
feel sure that they understood that only one of their daughters
could survive.
</P>
<P>
   The couple chose names for both babies and made plans to bury
one, who would be called Sandra Ivellise, in a family plot in
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, doctors and the family worried that both babies might
die even before they were born. Their circulatory condition, called
a TRAP sequence, for ``twin-reversed arterial perfusion,''
sometimes occurs in twins who are not conjoined but who have only
one heart. In those cases, the twin with the heart, referred to as
the ``pump twin,'' can die from heart failure induced by the strain
of pumping blood to its sibling. When the TRAP condition is
diagnosed in non-conjoined twins, doctors can operate on the
fetuses to cut off the blood supply to the second twin, which is
usually not fully developed anyway. The second twin dies, but the
twin with the heart is saved.
</P>
<P>
   But that procedure cannot be done if the twins are conjoined, as
the Soto babies were, because the death of one will kill the other
as well.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Soto's pregnancy progressed, fluid began to accumulate
in one of the twins' chests, a sign of heart failure. Doctors
feared the babies would be lost, but somehow the condition
resolved. A Caesarean delivery and immediate surgery for the babies
were planned for the first week of June.
</P>
<P>
   But at 7:00 a.m. on May 30, Mrs. Soto's obstetricians called
Fishman with alarming news. She had developed a disorder called
preeclampsia, and her blood pressure was so high she was at risk of
having a stroke . She needed a Caesarean immediately, the
obstetrician said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do that, the babies will die,'' Fishman said. He
pleaded for time to assemble his operating-room team, about 20
people. The obstetricians gave him 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The team gathered, and Fishman stood by in the delivery room at
Brigham and Women's Hospital, waiting to rush the babies through
the corridors to Children's Hospital, which is next door.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said later, he was unprepared for the emotional impact
of seeing two live babies, and knowing that soon there would be
only one. ``As much as we spent months planning for this, and it
seemed ethically and emotionally simple, nevertheless when I saw
them both initially pink and both crying and moving their arms and
having the same size bodies, it was heart wrenching,'' Fishman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Soto saw his daughters in the delivery room, but, he said,
he was afraid to touch them. Mrs. Soto, fearing that neither baby
would live, said she could not bear to see them.
</P>
<P>
   As the doctors had predicted, Sandra, who lacked a heart, began
to fail almost immediately when the cord was cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to see things change before our eyes,'' said Dr.
Errol Norwitz, part of the obstetrical team. ``She became cool, and
very pale.'' Her blood pressure was too low to measure, she lacked
a pulse and she was not getting enough oxygen. It was urgent that
she be separated from her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeons had to move quickly,'' he said. ``It got a little
hairy then.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies were given anesthesia, put on ventilators and whisked
off to the operating room. The surgery went smoothly; the most
wrenching moment occurred about two thirds of the way through the
procedure, Fishman said, when the twins were physically separated
at last, and it was time to take Sandra's body away.
</P>
<P>
   But Darielis survived. She spent 6 months in the hospital and
required more operations to repair a heart defect and an intestinal
obstruction. She also needed physical therapy and a brace to help
straighten her spine, which was curved backward from her cramped
position in the womb. And for her first year she had a bulge in her
chest the size of an adult's fist, created by a rib cage that
Fishman had constructed from Sandra's tissue and bone to protect
Darielis' heart, which at first did not fit into her chest. But
recent surgery has smoothed the bulge, and she looks completely
normal, with surprisingly faint scarring and a remarkably sunny
disposition, considering all she has been through.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Soto is expecting another baby, a girl, due in November.
But the family has not forgotten the daughter they lost. They hope
to visit Sandra's grave in Puerto Rico soon.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they would eventually tell Darielis about her
beginnings, Mr. and Mrs. Soto answered simultaneously, ``La
verdad.'' The truth.

   ``Bless the Child'' wants so badly to be ``The Sixth Sense'' for
the ``Touched By an Angel'' crowd. But for all its big-name talent,
computer-generated special effects and less-than-subtle ``Go,
God!'' mantra, ``Child'' is just another unremarkable entry in the
rapidly expanding Satan's-gonna-getcha subgenre of American horror.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is nurse Maggie O'Conner, a single
working girl turned unexpected mom when her junkie sister Jenna
(Angela Bettis) abandons her newborn infant one snowy Christmas
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the child is autistic, but Aunt Maggie's certain
there's something far more special about little Cody (apart from
the fact that she can spin objects with her mind and resurrect dead
animals, of course, but no one ever notices those things). When a
cleaned-up Jenna returns a few years later to reclaim the child
with her creepy self-help magnate boyfriend Eric Stark (Rufus
Sewell), it's clear that there are dark plans afoot for Cody.
</P>
<P>
   When Mom and Stark abduct the girl, Maggie turns to FBI agent
John Travis (Jimmy Smits) _ a former wannabe priest no less _ who
connects her case to a series of grisly, ritualistic child murders.
Turns out Cody's powers are just what Stark and his minions have
been searching for, and it's up to Maggie and Travis to find the
girl before an Easter eve showdown of good vs. evil.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the heavy-handed mumbo jumbo (all of which was done better
on Fox's defunct series ``Millennium),'' plenty of
computer-generated rats and gargoyles are thrown in for good
measure, which is a good thing considering how flat and unrealistic
the performances are.
</P>
<P>
   Basinger is far too glamorous to pull off the role of heroine,
and Smits is given practically nothing to do. And as for 7-year-old
Holliston Coleman, well, let's just say she's no Haley Joel Osment.
There are also a few glorified cameos: Christina Ricci spits out a
lot of narrative nonsense as a former member of Stark's army of
lost youth, and Ian Holm is the wizened old reverend on hand for
the odd Biblical consult.
</P>
<P>
   What's odd is that, for all the film's ham-handed religious
boosterism (all it's missing is Mel Brooks enthusiastically
shouting ``Send in the nuns!'') ``Bless the Child'' is exceedingly
violent. And this is the queasiest kind of movie violence _ the
killing of children.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Bible's a pretty violent book and all, but all the
angelic visions and biblical allegories aren't going to make the
horrific elements any more palatable for a mass audience. Of
course, maybe the film is going after heathens who flock to see
more irreverent entries such as ``End of Days, Stigmata'' or even
the upcoming rerelease of ``The Exorcist.'' Too bad the message
gets lost in the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' is rated R for graphic violence, scary
business and adult subject matter. &QL;

COMMENTARY: TWO KANGAROO TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: In penultimate graf: `I'm hurrying..,' the Jewish holiday
Tisha B'Av is a day of fasting and mourning commemorating the
destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in ancient Israel.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since the 1920 election _ when
Harding and Coolidge faced Cox and FDR _ we have a competition
between two ``kangaroo tickets.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A kangaroo is a mammal whose hindquarters are much stronger than
its forelegs. In political slang, a kangaroo ticket is one in which
the vice-presidential running mate is better equipped to become
president than the presidential nominee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, with no great grasp of world affairs, chose Dick
Cheney to add experience. Al Gore, tainted by fund-raising scandals
and association with a known president, chose Joe Lieberman in the
hope that his ethical stature and famous denunciation of Clinton
immorality would provide a quick rectitude fix. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's selection adds the element of discombobulation: by
placing the first Jew on a major national ticket, he confuses all
polling and transforms what only yesterday seemed to smug
Republicans like a sure thing for Bush into a close contest. Only
in America can you turn to a Jew for your hail-Mary pass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not content to let the historic shattering of an outdated taboo
speak for itself, Gore likened his choice of a Jew in 2000 to the
Democrats' choice of a Catholic named Kennedy in 1960. Lieberman
hailed it as a kind of miracle, evidence of ``the courage and
character and fairness of Al Gore.'' Their not-so-subtle idea is to
make a vote for the Democratic ticket not only a vote for
experience and rectitude, but a vote for tolerance.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turnabout is fair play; if rich, white male Republicans can
celebrate blacks, women and gays on stage in Philadelphia, then
scandal-ridden, diverse Democrats can celebrate their moralist in
Los Angeles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will the choice of Lieberman _ not only Jewish but an observant
exemplar of modern Orthodox Judaism _ give Gore's rating a
permanent lift into hot contention, and not just the usual
convention bounce?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He may make unsuspected inroads among fundamentalist Christians
because of an affinity among orthodoxies. He'll generate a greater
turnout among Jews, who vote 80 percent Democratic, and in a tight
election that might affect results in Florida and Illinois. The
Hitler vote will whip itself up, too, but Pat Buchanan should
siphon it off.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about Republican Jews? I depth-polled this minority of a
minority by talking to myself. If you vote for a Jew only because
he's a Jew, I opined, you legitimize others who vote against Jews
only for that reason. Down that ethnic road, in a population 98
percent non-Jewish, is no election of Jews to anything.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as JFK showed Catholics in appearing before Houston's
ministers, a first-time appeal has its ethnic tug. There is no
denying the good feeling that accompanies the realization that,
even at the top level of American politics, Jewishness is no longer
considered a negative.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes things,'' says Jacob Neusner, professor of religion
at Bard College and the most profound Talmudist I know. ``We are
used to coping with dislike for the unlike that is directed against
us. But how are we going to get accustomed to regarding being
Jewish as a plus?'' (A longtime Republican, Neusner says he'll
stick with Bush.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will soon reduce the cognitive dissonance in Jewish
Republicans by acting as a normal campaigner, denouncing Bush's
team as he did this week as ``the Old Guard that created the
problems.'' Perhaps ``the conscience of the Senate'' will assuage
concerns about Gore's unconscionable Asian fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   As Connecticut Joe smites the political foe at next week's
convention, freeing Gore to join Bush in genteel Civilityville, he
can expect return fire. It's no hypocrisy for him to play down
previous disagreement with Gore on school vouchers; it's
vice-presidential to fall in line. But that ``unpublished op-ed
piece'' that just surfaced, pushing back the date to June of
Lieberman's flip-flop on partial privatization of Social Security,
was too clever by half.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm hurrying to finish this column before sundown, when Tisha
B'Av begins. To sum up:
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice of the studious and inspiring Lieberman, like
Bush's choice of the serious and solid Cheney, reflects well on
both presidential candidates. And kangaroo tickets can surprise;
both strong hindquarters of 1920 went all the way.

BUSH BARNSTORMS THROUGH CALIFORNIA, REACHING FOR SUPPORT IN THE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. _ Gov. George W. Bush campaigned
throughout the state of California on Wednesday, speaking a little
Spanish, championing his education and tax proposals and focusing
on counties with relatively large numbers of voters in the center
of the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   It was the governor's seventh campaign trip to California since
he won the state's Republican primary early this year. And it
offered more than a glimpse into how Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, planned to challenge, or at least seem to
challenge, Vice President Al Gore for California's mother lode of
54 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   It also illuminated the Bush campaign's strategy from this point
forward: to select the places that, and seduce the people who,
tilted Democratic in the last two presidential elections but could
be made to lean in the other direction this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``El sueno Americano es para todos,'' Bush said at the train
station in Oxnard, north of Los Angeles, where he began a ride on
the rails up the California coast. The Texas governor was saying
that the American dream is for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   But he was speaking primarily to the broad, deep pool of swing
voters in Ventura County and elsewhere around the country. And he
was telling them _ as much with the accent as the content of his
words _ that they should feel comfortable voting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been doing that almost since the beginning of his
campaign, but his trip to the West Coast this week, like the
journeys he took in and out of the Republican National Convention,
represents an especially pointed, carefully aimed iteration of his
message.
</P>
<P>
   California, where Bush planned to spend Wednesday and Thursday,
and Oregon and Washington, where he was scheduled to travel later
this week, are states where President Clinton prevailed in 1992 and
1996. However, they are areas where demographic information and
some early polling suggest that Bush stands a good, decent or at
least plausible chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
   His itinerary this week reflects the Bush campaign's fierce
desire to look beyond the typical chain of Midwestern states that
teeter between Democrats and Republicans and put new places into
serious play.
</P>
<P>
   What these places have in common are an opportunity-rich supply
of ``weakly linked Republicans, weakly linked Democrats and
independent voters whose allegiances are up for grabs,'' said Karl
Rove, the Bush campaign's chief strategist. And what the Bush
campaign is doing is issuing a variety of invitations to these
fickle political consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, as Bush rode the rails through Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Michigan and Illinois, he repeatedly praised the hard work of
members of labor unions, made a point of having a former Democrat
introduce him at one event and, at that same event, rendered a
blunt, broad statement about just how big he wanted to spread his
tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a campaign that welcomes Democrats,'' Bush said on
Saturday in Durand, Mich., about midway between Detroit and
Kalamazoo. ``Our message isn't just a Republican message. Our
message speaks to working people from all walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has found another way to express that sentiment this week:
on Thursday through Saturday, he will campaign with Sen. John
McCain at his side. In the Republican primaries, McCain proved to
be a powerful lure for moderate Republicans, independents and
moderate Democrats, a centrist band of voters prevalent on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is reassuring to swing and independent voters,'' Rove
said. ``Bush ultimately has to make the sale, but McCain helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, too, is reaching hard for the center, as his selection of
Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut to be his running mate
demonstrated. Bush spoke publicly for the first time today about
that choice, and heartily praised it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's man of integrity,'' Bush said on the tarmac at
the naval air station in Point Mugu, where his campaign plane
landed late on Wednesday morning after a flight from Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bush was asked if Lieberman's reputation for moral
rectitude would make it more difficult for Republicans to link Gore
to President Clinton's behavior in office, Bush implied that it
would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember who's going to be the president,'' Bush said,
directing the spotlight away from Lieberman and toward Gore. ``The
race is between Al Gore and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also suggested that Gore would have to do more to separate
himself from the president than choose a running mate who had
harshly criticized Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Vice President Gore wants to say, `I'm different from
President Clinton,' let him explain how,'' Bush said. ``I'm saying
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying we'll set a new tone in Washington,'' he added,
referring to himself and his own running mate, Dick Cheney, the
former defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an interview with Fox television news, Bush fielded a
question about whether anti-Semitism might hurt the Gore-Lieberman
ticket by saying, ``I believe America has grown beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be some people,'' Bush added, ``who are going
to criticize Senator Lieberman because of his religion, and if
they're in my campaign, I'll just ask them to leave.'' Lieberman is
the first Jewish person on a major party's presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In setting out for California on Wednesday morning, Bush was
trying both to end several days during which he ceded the news
media spotlight to Gore and Lieberman and to crash, or at least
pre-empt, Gore's imminent party here. The Democratic National
Convention takes place Monday through Thursday in Los Angeles.

LAYOFF RATE FALLS IN NEW GOVERNMENT REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS release day in the lede and graph 12, ``Farber, who has
worked...'' to reflect that the report was issued on Wednesday sted
Thursday) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the U.S. economy enjoying its longest economic expansion on
record, the number of permanent layoffs declined over the last
three years, the government reported on Wednesday. The rate may now
match the lowest in the 20-year history of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The new data also shows that women are now laid off virtually as
often as men, closing a wide gap that had existed for most of the
last 20 years. At the same time, the layoff rate for blacks rose.
And the gap between the layoff rate for blacks compared with whites
widened significantly over the last three years. The layoff rate
for Hispanics, however, dropped sharply, falling below that of
blacks. The differential between whites and Hispanics also
narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   During the three years that ended with 1999, 3.3 million workers
on the job for three years or more were laid off while 4.3 million
workers on the job for less then three years lost their jobs, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in its biennial job
displacement survey. This compares with total layoffs of 8 million,
3.6 million of them on the job for three years or more, from 1995
to 1997. And that is down from a total of 8.4 million in the period
from 1993 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is more drastic when looked at as a percentage of
laid off workers compared with the total number of employed
workers. According to the bureau, that declined to 6.1 percent in
the last three years, from 6.6 percent in 1995 through 1997 and 8
percent in 1993 through 1995. And this 6.1 percent may be near or
even match the low for the survey, which goes back to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The first bureau survey was released in 1984. But because the
way the survey was conducted was changed from five-year periods to
three-year periods in the report released in 1994, it is difficult
to make historical comparisons. Steve Hipple, the economist at the
bureau who oversees the job displacement data, said that the rate
of job layoffs was probably understated in the earlier data.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the case, the 6.1 percent layoff rate from the last
three years may actually be equal to the 5.5 percent rate reported
for 1987 through 1989, the low in the bureau's data.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline in the layoff rate in the last three year was
far less than in the preceding three years, when the rate for all
workers 20 years and older fell 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not surprising that in a strong job market that job loss
declined,'' said Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University
who studies job displacement data. He said that even with a strong
economy, there would be layoffs as some industries shrink while
others grow.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest layoff rate, 5.7 percent, was for workers 45 to 54.
Of all the displaced workers, nearly three-quarters had new jobs by
the time the survey was taken in February. Nearly three-fifths of
those laid off from wage and salary jobs found new jobs that paid
the same or more.
</P>
<P>
   While the layoff rate for blacks did increase to 7.3 percent, it
is still significantly below the level earlier in the 1990s, when
it was as high as 9.4 percent between 1991 and 1995. The increase
in the difference between the layoff rate for blacks and whites
ends six years of narrowing. In the three-year period from 1991
through 1993, the gap was 1.4 percentage points. It narrowed to 0.5
percentage point in the next three-year period and was 0.6
percentage point in 1995 though 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hipple could not say why the gap had widened again. He said that
the existence of a gap was consistent with the fact that the
unemployment rate for whites is lower than that for blacks. But he
said it was hard to tell whether this year's widening of the gap
was a one-time event or not.
</P>
<P>
   Farber, who has worked with the bureau's jobs data for years,
could not comment in detail on the change in the layoff rates for
blacks because he had not yet received the backup data on which
Wednesday's release was based. But he said ``the black number is an
interesting number and something to point out.''
</P>
<P>
   The layoff rate of Hispanics fell to 7 percent over the last
three years from 8.8 percent. That is the lowest it has been since
the the 1990-1991 recession. The gap between the white and Hispanic
layoff rate narrowed to 1 percentage point from 2.3 percentage
points in the 1995-97 period.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the layoff rate for women and men has been
narrowing over the last 20 years, with the biggest changes coming
in times of strong job growth. In 1991-93, the gap was 7.4 percent
for women and 8.8 percent for men. That narrowed to 7.6 percent for
women and 8.4 percent for men in 1993-95, to 6.5 percent for women
and 6.7 percent for men in 1995-97 and to 6.1 percent for women and
6 percent for men in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's jobs are concentrated in service industries and the
risk of job losses in services industries has grown over time,''
Hipple said.

ALTAMONT:   AN END, AND   A BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 By GERALD MARZORATI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   What gets called the '60s had any
number of endings, most of them elusive or much debated. But for
those who understood the decade (or era, or moment) as more a
cultural than a political phenomenon _ a last, late Romantic
pastoral _ the end came quite precisely and inarguably: Friday
night, Dec. 6, 1969, at the Altamont Speedway not far from San
Francisco, as the Rolling Stones, distracted and distraught, worked
their way through ``Under My Thumb.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hell's Angels had been hired to provide security at the
free, outdoor Altamont festival, which drew 300,000 people and was
to feature not only the Stones but also the Grateful Dead (whose
manager had recommended the Angels' services), Santana, the
Jefferson Airplane and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. The Angels,
many of them new recruits to the club with something to prove,
spent much of the afternoon clearing the area in front of the stage
with the help of weighted pool cues. Then, a few songs into the
Stones' closing set, several of the Angels developed a particular
interest in an 18-year-old black man 10 or 15 yards from the stage.
Meredith Hunter was attacked by one of the Angels, and when he
pulled a gun and ran, was chased down, stabbed and beaten to death
by a pack of them. None of the Stones could see this, but they knew
something was happening _ it was there in the confusion of their
playing, and in the fear they conveyed to one another in those
quick glances with which longtime band mates say all that needs to
be said.
</P>
<P>
   This moment is understood in such terrible detail largely
because of ``Gimme Shelter,'' the extraordinary cinema verite
account by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin of the
Stones' 1969 American tour that ended in the Altamont darkness. The
documentary, which takes its name from a Stones song, was something
of a hit for months after it opened in September 1970 _ a run that
solidified Altamont in the counterculture imagination as the Last
Big Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   The film also inspired reams of a very '60s kind of commentary.
There were analyses of the lyrics of Stones songs like ``Sympathy
for the Devil,'' raising the possibility that the band's own music
had somehow conjured the Altamont debacle. And there were anguished
tracts that pondered the fate of the nation's youth and the
collapse of Woodstock Nation. The critic Albert Goldman, writing in
The New York Times, suggested that the movie documented how the
``most unruly generation in American history is demanding _ and
receiving _ punishment by big father figures.'' For Goldman and
others, the Stones' '69 tour was not about rock music, really. It
was about the big stuff _ the darkness of the social unconscious,
of modern civilization itself _ for which the music was just a
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt that the 30th-anniversary rerelease of ``Gimme Shelter''
(it opened on Friday) will engender that sort of Last Days
exegesis. It remains a remarkable film nevertheless, and one of its
many remarkable aspects is its very un-60's-like measure: it
unfolds the story of Altamont vividly, but not to the exclusion of
other stories. One of these _ and the one that, 30 years on,
matters more to cultural history than Altamont _ is that of a band
bringing to pop music the spectacle and glamour and startling sonic
intensity that had always been rock's promise. On what could be
called the prototype for the arena-rock tour, the Stones were not
only securing their place as the premiere band of that time but
pointing where rock, for better and for worse, would go in the
1970s and beyond. The Stones weren't the end of anything but a
beginning, ambitious and sensational.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gimme Shelter's'' first extended scene takes place, oddly and
effectively, after Altamont, with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and
Charlie Watts ruminating about the concert in the Maysles' editing
room. It's a setting that is returned to time and again as the film
cuts from concert performances to backstage scenes, and
occasionally fast-forwards to the negotiations that at the 11th
hour allowed the big free concert to go on. The editing room trope
creates self-consciousness and distance, durable guards against
sensationalism. But more than that, it permits the Stones _
studying film of the tour on editing monitors _ to be introduced as
many could not or would not imagine them back then: as serious
young musicians baffled by how their story had somehow, in a
knife-flash, come down to this.
</P>
<P>
   The group had not been to America since the summer of 1966, when
a fan was still likely to be a sobbing girl chaperoned by her dad.
The Stones had been through a lot since then: drug charges,
squabbles and, musically, a disappointing psychedelic period that
culminated in a portentous mess of an album, ``Their Satanic
Majesties Request.'' By the end of 1967, Brian Jones was drifting
deeper into drugs and booze, and there were rumors of a Stones
split-up.
</P>
<P>
   In the first months of 1968, Jagger and Richards, who together
wrote the band's songs, set about to rid their music of all
flower-power traces and to recapture the Stones' essence: fast,
hard, rocking blues, metallic and elemental. But the hit singles
like ``Jumpin' Jack Flash'' and the rock songs on their album
``Beggar's Banquet'' _ it had acoustic tunes, too, which sound a
lot like today's alt-country _ represented more than a simple
return to roots. The rock was now more epic and anthemic, the
lyrics more imagistic (and lubricious), the playing more
sophisticated and the sound more grittily viscid than any that pop
music had yet produced. It begged to be played loud and live, and
it's what the Stones brought with them to America in October 1969.
</P>
<P>
   With them, too, was a young blues guitar player named Mick
Taylor; he was taking the place of Jones, who had been forced out
of the group in June 1968 and, a month later, was found dead in his
swimming pool. Along for the tour's last weeks was the documentary
crew _ actually a couple of different crews, hastily assembled when
the Stones decided, more than halfway into the tour, that a film
might be a cool idea. (The band maintained a veto over the film's
content, a power they chose, in the end, not to exercise, though
reportedly not without some anguish.) ``Gimme Shelter's'' anxious,
quickened feel no doubt owes something to the last-minute nature of
the project, but it is in keeping with the Maysles' aesthetic,
which was to grab truth where it lay in agile, relatively
unobtrusive snatches, and so limn the reality hidden in plain
sight.
</P>
<P>
   The ``truth'' about the Stones turns out to be what
fundamentally un-countercultural lives they were leading. There was
more hard liquor around than hard drugs, and their taste in women
ran not to hippie chicks but to Marilyn Monroe ( Richards shows off
a T-shirt with her bosomy image) and Tina Turner (who, with husband
Ike, opened for them on the tour). Mainly, though, there was work:
the shuttles to the airport in packed sedans and to concerts in
dangerously packed helicopters; the meetings with the press and the
concert organizers; the album cover to shoot and the album to mix.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the most inspired work the Stones do in ``Gimme
Shelter'' is on stage. Concert footage was shot not only at the
Altamont festival but during several shows at Madison Square Garden
two weeks earlier, and it's these scenes, in the force and very
essence of what they capture, that put Altamont in perspective _
that, in effect, put the lie to Altamont's stated purpose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the film, Jagger is seen pontificating to the
press about how the festival would create ``a sort of microcosmic
society'' from which everyone, you know, might learn to live
together and love together. But the Stones had no genuine interest
in furthering the Woodstock Nation, whatever that was. On stage,
their desire was to commune with the ghosts of the Mississippi
Delta and with one another. At the Garden, commune they did.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatically lighted, suffused with a pop glamour only the
Beatles rivaled (and they were no longer touring) and benefiting
from a state-of-the-art sound system that captures their dirty
rocking blues with astonishing vibrance and clarity, the Stones
play furiously, the guitars clawing at one another, the bass and
drums thundering.Each of the band members is lost in the music,
particularly Jagger, who, prancing and shimmying and singing
ecstatically, somehow embodies the mesmerizing sound. The audience
connects, but not as compatriots. They're enraptured spectators.
(The film shows this, too.) They're experiencing what gets called
art.
</P>
<P>
   I was there, down with the cameras, when the Stones came on past
midnight at the last Garden show. I was 16, and I had spent much of
the evening wending my way from the cheap seats toward the stage. I
got about as close to the Stones as Meredith Hunter did, and later
I would think about that a lot, but not because I ever thought it
could have been me. Meredith Hunter's death was not about the
Stones, or the '60s. He perished in the miasma of booze and drugs
and testosterone that still poisons soccer matches and late-night
bars along with rock festivals, here and around the world. That
wasn't the mood of the Garden that night.
</P>
<P>
   The only danger that night was the danger created by certain
types of music _ the sound of dread experience, seeking you out. It
couldn't bring about a ``microcosmic society,'' that music, but it
could overpower you, make you feel things, show you a nasty good
time and give you something to marvel at.
</P>
<P>
   The Stones, through the mid-'70s, would perfect this kind of
spectacular rock show by professional rock stars, and countless
others would embroider upon what they more or less invented in the
fall of '69: Led Zeppelin, U2 and Pearl Jam, and, it should not go
unmentioned, Aerosmith, Guns 'n' Roses and Limp Bizkit. No band,
though, ever played it better than the one captured 30 years ago,
and forever, in ``Gimme Shelter.''

   BURLINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Two small planes collided in the sky
over a southern New Jersey subdivision Wednesday morning, killing
all 11 people on board and raining bodies onto a soccer field and
through the roof of a garage. One plane crashed through the roof of
another two-car garage and exploded, setting fire to the home of a
couple who were showering and dressing for work.
</P>
<P>
   No one on the ground appeared to have been hurt as a result of
the collision, which involved a charter plane carrying civilian
employees of the Navy and a plane carrying a licensed pilot and an
instructor. The cause was not known late Wednesday. Both planes
were flying without the guidance of air traffic controllers. The
pilots were expected to see and avoid other traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The collision occurred at 7:54 a.m., apparently southeast of a
sprawling development called Steeplechase that sprang up in recent
years in what had been farmland north of Philadelphia, about 10
miles south of Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   The plane carrying the pilot and instructor crashed in a soybean
field northeast of the development. The engine of the charter plane
plummeted into a front yard while the fuselage crashed into the
garage. Three bodies landed in the soccer field, where one woman
said she had glimpsed two bodies still belted into seats. Another
body plunged through the roof of a garage on Spur Court.
</P>
<P>
   Debris lay scattered like confetti along Steeplechase Boulevard.
Jackie Framo, getting dressed, looked out her window to see a chunk
of engine smouldering in a crater on her lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another few feet and it would have been in my ear,'' said Ed
Trzaskawka, who told The Associated Press that he was preparing for
work when most of the charter plane hit the garage of his house on
Philly Court and blew up. According to the New Jersey State Police,
Trzaskawka's wife, Cathy, was in the shower. They grabbed their dog
and fled before the house burned.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman, who said Cathy Trzaskawka had worked in
the governor's office until several years ago, said at a news
conference in a nearby baseball field Wednesday afternoon, ``If you
can look for a bright side of this, the miracle is that no one on
the ground was injured. Even in the house into which the plane
crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Arlene Salac, a spokeswoman for the Federal
Aviation Administration, the larger of the two twin-engine planes,
was a PA31 Piper Navajo registered to Tigress Air Inc. of
California, Md., and doing business as Patuxent Airway. The smaller
plane was a PA44 Piper Seminole, operated by Hortman Aviation, a
flight school based at Northeast Philadelphia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The charter plane, with two pilots and seven passengers, was on
a daily shuttle flight between the Lakehurst Naval Air Station in
New Jersey and Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland. The
pilot had flown to Trenton-Mercer Airport under air traffic control
guidance, then had chosen to fly under so-called visual flight
rules for the second leg, Salac said.
</P>
<P>
   The other plane, carrying an instructor who worked for the
Hortman Aviation flight school and a licensed pilot who was seeking
an advanced rating, had set off from Northeast Philadelphia
Airport. The two men had planned to fly in a large circle over an
area designated by the FAA as a flight practice area, according to
Herbert Hortman, the owner of the school.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor was Craig Robinson, 28, of Hamilton Township. He
was also an officer with the Washington Township Police Department
in Mercer County. According to Hortman, Robinson was an experienced
pilot with between 1,800 and 2,000 hours of flying time. Hortman
said the plane, a 1982 aircraft, had passed a full maintenance
inspection one month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not appear to be a mechanical problem,'' Hortman said.
``It appears to be strictly a mid-air. Unfortunately, it's like if
you're out driving in your car and somebody drives through an
intersection and hits you.''

MOSCOW ARRESTS SUSPECTS BUT CAN'T LINK ANY TO FATAL BOMBING
</HEADLINE>
  (RECASTS 2nd graf to change meaning)  
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian law enforcement officials said Wednesday they
had detained a number of suspects in their investigation into the
terrorist bombing of an underground pedestrian walkway that killed
seven people and wounded 97 Tuesday evening. But they said that so
far none could be linked directly to the bombing in the heart of
the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual rebuke to Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, who was
quick to attribute the bombing to Chechens fighting for
independence from Russia, President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday
that ``it would be wrong'' to ``brand a whole people'' in the
absence of proof of who was behind the bombing. The police and
prosecutors also said they had no evidence of Chechen involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's admonition reflected the political sensitivities of
Russian leaders who are trying to build a viable new government in
Chechnya, said Alexei Zudin, a political analyst. The rush to
judgment exemplified by Luzhkov's statements, he said, fed the
worst suspicions of Chechen civilians who have suffered through two
rebellions and two devastating invasions by the Russian military
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blame for this affair cannot be generalized to all Chechens,''
Zudin said, even if evidence gathered eventually points toward the
rebellious republic, where rebel leaders have in recent weeks
threatened to strike Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Putin said Russia would carry on the military campaign
``to its completion'' and ``finish off terrorists in their own
den.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, combined Russian security forces said they had
scoured 160 subway stations and underground passageways using
bomb-sniffing dogs to ensure that the capital's public transit
system with its extensive maze of interconnecting tunnels was clear
of explosives. At Moscow's Kazansky railway station police
reportedly found nearly nine pounds of TNT as well as seven
detonators, which were not hooked up to the explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Muscovites were back underground as usual,
with thousands of them passing through the reopened, though charred
passageways beneath Pushkin Square, where vendors picked through
the debris in their shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we will go back to work here,'' said one middle-aged
woman sorting through the lingerie in her darkened kiosk. ``And of
course we are scared,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The low granite walls along the exits from the underground
passageways had already become memorial altars, where friends,
relatives and passersby laid carnations and lilies to express their
sympathy for those who died. Russian television reported Wednesday
night that Putin, too, visited the square and laid flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they were working with three witnesses who
saw two men bargaining at a leather goods shop in the tunnel and
who dashed for an exit leaving a satchel behind that exploded
moments after the salesgirl summoned a security officer to inspect
the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, speaking at the Kremlin, struck a note of calm
resolution, admonishing Russians that terrorism was an
``international illness'' for which the only cure was ``political
will,'' the ``vigilance of the people'' and effective law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists, he said, ``count on bloodshed, sensation, panic and
hysteria.'' And he warned that ``disorganization and disorder would
make the best possible gift for them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If politics is the art of seeing your opportunities
and taking them, Joseph Lieberman seized his first opportunity by
writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   When Lieberman, the son of a liquor store owner, was a senior at
Yale University with a desire to run for office, he wrote his
college thesis on the quintessential political boss John Bailey of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see that there was no better way to learn about the
history and intricacies of Connecticut's government than to study
John Bailey,'' Lieberman wrote in his memoir, ``In Praise of Public
Life,'' more than three decades later. ``The hours I spent
interviewing him that winter were priceless, my own private course
in political science.''
</P>
<P>
   The admiring thesis turned into two books, ``The Power Broker,''
published in 1966 and a reworked version, ``The Legacy,'' updated
and published in 1981. But, as importantly, the thesis led
Lieberman to a ringside seat in politics, a summer job at the
Democratic National Committee, which Bailey headed during the
presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Across his career in politics, Lieberman, a Democratic senator
from Connecticut and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, has
written five books that give insight into his range of interests,
his ways of thinking and the forces that have shaped his life.
</P>
<P>
   His second book, ``The Scorpion and the Tarantula,'' was an
account of what he called the ``disastrous failure of statecraft''
in the dawn of the nuclear age.
</P>
<P>
   As Connecticut's attorney general, Lieberman wrote ``Child
Support in America,'' a handbook on how to collect delinquent child
support payments.
</P>
<P>
   This year, having received national attention with his
condemnation of President Clinton for his affair with a White House
intern, Lieberman published his memoir in defense of government
service in an age of cynicism. Reviewers saw the book as a bid for
the attention of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In most of his books, Lieberman details history. But he went
beyond history in ``The Scorpion and the Tarantula,'' to argue that
if the United States had openly recognized a Soviet sphere of
influence in Eastern Europe after World War II, it might have
helped reduce Soviet suspicions enough to achieve international
control of atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a step, he wrote, ``would have amounted to the
acknowledgment of reality,'' a reality that ``was a fact of
American foreign policy in the years that followed, even if it was
never articulated as such. The passivity of the United States in
both the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and the Czechoslovakian tremors
of 1968 makes it clear that American diplomats have accepted the
fact that Eastern Europe is a Soviet sphere of influence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman can also delve into the personal. In his last book
_ the only one written with a co-author, Michael D'Orso _ he tells
of the collapse of his first marriage to Betty Haas, whom he met
when they were both interns in the office of Sen. Abraham A.
Ribicoff of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no single reason our marriage failed,'' he wrote.
``Some of it had to do with the different directions in which our
personalities and careers developed. Some of it was related to the
fact that I had become much more religiously observant than I was
when we met and married. And there is no doubt that some of it was
caused by the demands my political career put on our private life.
That is surely one of the great costs and risks of public life.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start of his career, Lieberman was fascinated with
politics. It shows in the way he wrote of Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, suspicious of machine bosses, called Bailey ``a
mysterious figure of merciless, manipulative genius. He was not
totally evil, but then again he was not a philosopher king
either.''
</P>
<P>
   But he came to admire Bailey for his choice of candidates, his
love of politics and the unity he brought to the state Democratic
Party. ``Bailey's organization evidently did not feed on the
corruption which seemed to be necessary fuel for the traditional
American political machine,'' he wrote in ``The Power Broker.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is his memoir, ``In Praise of Public Life,''that is the
most revealing _ coincidentally because of the way that it allows
Lieberman to be compared to another son of Yale, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   At times the two men can sound uncannily alike. Like Bush,
Lieberman says his service in state government taught him
bipartisan consensus. And, like Bush, Lieberman condemns attack
politics, ``the kind of negative campaigning and mudslinging that
leaves both winners and losers dirtied and degraded in the public
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   But take a closer look at ``In Praise of Public Life,'' and it
is as if Lieberman and Bush have actually lived in parallel
universes.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman writes of being inspired by the Rev. William Sloane
Coffin, the Yale chaplain and renowned anti-war protester, to lead
a group of classmates to Mississippi to help register black voters
for a mock election in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, has recalled Coffin telling him that the
better man had won when Bush's father lost a Senate race in Texas.
To Bush, Coffin became another kind of symbol, of an Eastern
intellectual elite opposed to traditional values. The Texas
governor's suspicion of figures like Coffin led him to a political
philosophy that considered the 1960s a time of irresponsible ideas
and rebellions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush last week largely attributed the practice of attack
politics to Clinton, but Lieberman dated it back 30 years and gave
both parties a share in the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three decades have seen an unprecedented parade of
betrayals of the public's trust,'' Lieberman wrote in his memoir.
He described a political landscape that stretched ``from the
deception that lay behind the Vietnam War, to the shock of the
Watergate scandal'' and through the Iran-Contra hearings, a chain
of poisonous hearings like the Senate confirmation hearing of
Clarence Thomas to a seat on the Supreme Court, and ``the earth
shaking impeachment experience of 1998 and 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing books can be risky in politics. Republicans have used
Gore's book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' as fodder for criticism of
the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Republicans say they have focused on only one
particular passage of Lieberman's books, a condemnation of the kind
of opposition research that pries into candidates' personal lives.
It is likely to be thrown back at him if the campaign turns nasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned, this kind of digging does nothing
but demean our politics and defame the people who are its
targets,'' Lieberman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with going after your opponent's voting
record or any other evidence of negligence in his public life, but
digging into his bank account, his phone records, his medical
history, his sexual life and literally his garbage when these
things have nothing to do with the performance of his public duties
_ past, present or future _ is wrong.''

 &HT;         BUSH SAYS TEXAS DOESN'T EXECUTE THE RETARDED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 &HT;    By JOHN W. GONZALEZ and POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    OXNARD, Calif. _ Gov. George W. Bush claimed Wednesday that
<TEXT>
Texas doesn't execute mentally retarded killers, although at least
five such convicts have been put to death in recent years.
<P>
   The comment came as the GOP presidential nominee was campaigning
in California, hours before two Texas inmates were executed. One of
the inmates, Oliver D. Cruz, was described as mentally retarded,
though that conclusion was challenged by prosecutors earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Answering news media questions upon his arrival from Texas, Bush
indicated that justice was being served with the executions of Cruz
and a second inmate, Brian Roberson. But when told that several
states have banned the execution of mentally retarded inmates, Bush
said, ``So do we, in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   However, no ban has been approved by Texas lawmakers, although
they tried as recently as 1999 and failed. Bush opposed that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Constraints in existing law, which Bush cited as safeguards,
failed to prevent the execution of five mentally retarded inmates
since 1984 _ six according to those who argue that Cruz was
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anybody tried in the state of Texas, mental capacity is a
factor, not only during the trial phase but during the appellate
phase,'' Bush said. ``... In all cases, mental competency is a
factor in Texas law.''
</P>
<P>
   Queried about his opposition to the 1999 bill to ban executions
of the retarded, Bush insisted Texas' current law is adequate. And
that's the point he was trying to make when he made his
controversial remark, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas law has many safeguards in place to prevent someone who
is not competent from even going to trial, much less being
executed,'' said campaign spokesman Scott McClellan, adding that at
least five laws come into play in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if one juror has reasonable doubts about the defendant's
mental ability to form the intent to commit a crime, then that
person must be acquitted,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's execution of Cruz drew more than the usual
attention on Texas' death chamber, the busiest in the nation. That
is in part because of the debate over executing people with mental
retardation and because of Bush's bid for the presidency, which has
put his positions on crime and punishment under heavy scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's discussion with reporters on the topic ended as he headed
to a campaign event, and he wasn't immediately available to
elaborate. The candidate was making a train tour of portions of
California.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat, was author of the
bill last year that would have banned the execution of inmates with
an IQ of 65 or lower. Ellis said in an interview Wednesday that
Bush told him at the time, ``I think current law is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill passed the Texas Senate, 22-8, it died in a
House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he plans to reintroduce the bill next spring to ban
the execution of anyone with an IQ of 70 or lower and to make it
retroactive to include those on death row now.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 34 mentally retarded offenders with IQs of 70 or
lower have been executed since April 5, 1984, according to the
Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, five were in Texas, not counting Cruz. One man, a
33-year-old black man named Terry Washington, was executed during
Bush's administration. Another mentally retarded offender, Mario
Marquez, was executed roughly 12 hours before Bush was sworn in on
Inauguration Day, Jan. 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of Marquez's retardation was not even allowed to be
presented to the jury. It took a 1989 U.S. Supreme Court decision
to force Texas courts to allow presentation of mitigating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Washington, whose IQ was thought to range between
58 and 69, he was executed on May 6, 1997. He was convicted in the
murder of Beatrice Huling, 29, a night manager at the restaurant
where he worked as a dishwasher. He tied her up with apron strings,
tortured her with a knife and then stabbed her 85 times.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty supporters argue that the Supreme Court has made
it clear that the issue is whether a person is mentally competent
to understand the crime and punishment. As to whether it is moral
to execute mentally retarded people, Dianne Clements of Justice for
All responds, ``The moral standard is don't rape and murder
people.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ellis' bill to ban such executions were to pass next year,
Texas would join 12 other states that do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apparently does not understand the difference between
mental illness, mental retardation and insanity, Ellis said when
told of Bush's remarks on the campaign trail.

AT A MISSION FOR THE NEEDY, CHENEY PREACHES `COMPASSIONATE
CONSERVATISM' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In his first solo campaign swing as the Republican
vice presidential nominee, Dick Cheney took his ticket's message of
``compassionate conservatism'' to an inner-city homeless shelter
here Wednesday and promised that a Bush administration would expand
federal support for church-based social service groups.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also muffled his attacks on Vice President Al Gore by
praising his choice for running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man, well qualified for the post,'' Cheney told
reporters. ``Everything I know about the guy is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's Jewish faith should have no effect on the race,
Cheney said. ``I don't think it's an issue,'' he said. ``I think
the country is far beyond any kind of religious-based bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Still buoyant from a three-day rail trip with Gov. George W.
Bush across key battleground states last weekend, Cheney and his
wife, Lynne, picked Sunshine Ministries, a century-old soup kitchen
that now also counsels drug and alcohol abusers and provides
after-school classes for poor children, as their first stump stop
away from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said that he would emphasize Bush's campaign themes _
education, Social Security, tax reform and rebuilding the military
_ in a three-day trip through swing states including Ohio and
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the mission's brick building here, surrounded by
rubble-strewn empty lots 10 minutes from St. Louis' glistening
signature archway, the Cheneys met with several of the youngsters
who attend after-school programs that teach fellowship and
practical skills. Lynne Cheney plunged right in, eagerly greeting
each teen-ager by name, but Dick Cheney seemed less comfortable in
the glare of jostling television crews. When Felicia Hollis, 14,
stumbled a bit explaining her goal to be a prosecutor one day, the
vice presidential nominee said, ``The cameras make me nervous,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Clarkson, the ministries' associate director, said the
mission that runs a 45-person shelter, offers food, clothing and
job training to 300 families in four nearby federal housing
projects, and provides classes to 200 children after school.
</P>
<P>
   The church-based center derives its entire $2 million annual
budget from private contributions, Clarkson said, and symbolizes
the kind of non-governmental, community-rooted approach to social
services and education that is a hallmark of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about organizations like Sunshine
Ministries is it demonstrates that government doesn't have a
monopoly on the wisdom of how to deal with society's problems,''
Cheney told local community and religious leaders invited to the
afternoon event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, only three federal social service programs allow
religious organizations to apply for funding on the same basis as
other providers,'' Cheney said. ``Governor Bush and I believe
faith-based groups, whether Mormon or Methodist or Muslim, ought to
be eligible for public money to advance their good work.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Cheney said, the Bush administration would expand
the federal charitable deductions for 80 million taxpayers who do
not itemize their deductions, swelling the resources available to
groups like Sunshine Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush administration would also broaden federal support for
after-school programs, said Cheney. ``After-school programs are
vital in terms of reducing drug use, teen pregnancy and criminal
behavior by providing young people things to do and places to be,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked later how these pledges contrasted with a 10-year
voting record in the House that including opposing the Head Start
education program, Cheney sidestepped the question, retorting that
it ``probably squares as well as Joe Lieberman's voting record with
Al Gore's.''
</P>
<P>
   That response offered a glimpse into what is likely to be a
Republican refrain from now until the election: ``I think it's
going to be tough for Al Gore to be as aggressively negative on
some of Governor Bush's ideas which his own running mate supports,
like school vouchers and ballistic missile defense,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney said the contrasts between the running mates will
stand out, including his tenure as White House chief of staff under
President Ford and secretary of defense under President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly products of our experiences,'' Cheney told
reporters. ``I've got a lot of experience in the White House and
Defense Department. Joe's background has a stronger legal
dimension, as an attorney and attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the chips are down,'' Cheney continued, ``I hope the
American people will believe my experience and what I've got to
offer adds more to the Bush ticket than Joe adds to the Gore
ticket.''

AS COWBOYS' MIGHTY '90S GANG FADES AWAY, SO DOES TEAM'S CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Troy Aikman stared off into the practice
field yonder, saying nothing for a second, but displaying a
hard-edged look.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will find another cornerback, but what we won't find is
another Kevin Smith,'' he finally uttered, sounding dejected.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' ``Brotherhood of the Mighty '90s'' lost yet another
charter member yesterday. It has been a bad year for this sort of
thing. Michael, Moose and now ``Pup,'' forced into retirement by
the same body that not so long ago helped bring a Super Bowl
dynasty to Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement on Smith will come this week. But the
first goodbyes were yesterday, after a training camp of
disappointment for Kevin.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month, his health status had appeared worse than
ever, which prompted Smith to leave camp on Tuesday. The end had
come. Retirement is so much better than his being simply released,
which football-wise was a possibility. But respect-wise, that
couldn't and shouldn't have happened.
</P>
<P>
   And the respect factor for Smith is what Aikman was talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team wins like we won over an extended period of time,
there is so much more involved than just the talent level or the
system or whatever,'' Aikman said. ``More than anything else, Kevin
was a great team player who was a great teammate, who stands as an
example of what being a true professional is all about. Kevin is
nothing but class. We won, because as a team, we had leaders like
Kevin Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   That grand ol' gang is breaking up, rapidly. The Cowboys of the
early '90s have their place in NFL history as one of the best
collections of talent ever assembled. But it's the foundation
pieces of that era who are now saying good-bye, and the impact is
being felt in different areas. Such as in team leadership all the
way down to salary cap implications.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, as would be expected, had done much to postpone this
farewell, trying desperately to overcome one injury after another.
Most of his ongoing ailments stem from compensating for the
blown-out Achilles' tendon to open the '95 season.
</P>
<P>
   That disaster would change Pup's career forever. He was never
the same. He lost that proverbial ``step.'' Criticism flowed for
his performance, particularly the past few years, but Kevin never
met a sportswriter he wouldn't look right in the eye after every
game, good day or bad day.
</P>
<P>
   He might no longer have been the best cornerback in town, but
Smith was the only true ``stand-up'' cornerback the Cowboys have
had of late.
</P>
<P>
   The best memories of Kevin Smith go back to '92, when the feisty
rookie from Aggieland broke into the starting lineup and stayed
there all the way through the first Super Bowl victory. Fearless
and gifted, Smith was at his best in '93, even verbally gigging
receiver Jerry Rice in a pregame exchange and flare-up before the
famous ``Put It in Three-Inch Headlines'' championship contest with
the 49ers at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As former teammate and now secondary coach Bill Bates said
yesterday: ``Kevin truly gave his heart, his soul and his body to
the Dallas Cowboys. The only thing I ask is that now, at this
particular difficult time that comes for all of us in the game,
Kevin be given the ultimate respect by the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Done.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones will bring Smith onto the coaching staff as an
assistant to Bates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everything about Kevin Smith to rub off on those young
corners,'' Jones said yesterday. ``I can't think of a better
teacher or guy to serve as an example of what a player in the NFL
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Of interest, however, is that while Smith was not being counted
on as a starter this season, both Jones and Dave Campo said
yesterday they don't plan on finding a veteran corner to replace
Smith. That goes against some precamp theories that if the Cowboys
could somehow ``persuade'' Smith to retire, they would become very
active in the cornerback market.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, however, the game plan apparently stays the
course that Campo and defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer have
privately preached all along. A rookie will be starting opposite
newcomer Ryan McNeil, not necessarily at the beginning of the
season, but at least at some point in 2000. Despite early fan and
media criticism, the Cowboys remain firm in claiming they will find
a starter from one of the three rookie corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me on that one; I've been doing this 30 years,'' Campo
said, lightly chiding the media during his news conference
yesterday. OK, Dave. We believe you. Sorta. Maybe. Are you sure,
coach?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, that mighty '90s brotherhood lost another good one
yesterday.

BUSINESS DISHES UP ICE CREAM FOR DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW THOMPSON   The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Kimberly Cohen has an ambitious business
venture. ``I want to be the Ben and Jerry's of doggy ice cream,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who moved to Gainesville from New York this past year, is
the founder of Pink Belly Ice Pups, which offers four flavors of
ice cream for dogs. With a $10,000 loan from her family, Cohen
expanded on an idea born on a warm afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to spoil my dog,'' she said, referring to Lucy, her
6-pound Yorkshire terrier, ``and I just thought `ice cream.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But like chocolate, ice cream can be harmful to dogs because of
sugar, salt and other preservatives. So, Cohen mixed some nondairy
yogurt with chicken, and had her first batch of
``Cocka-Poodle-do,'' the best-selling flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monkey Madness'' has peanut butter and bananas; ``Chubby
Puppy'' is filled with peanut butter, and ``Where's the Beef'' has
meat and honey. All of Cohen's flavors use some combination of
nondairy yogurt with beef, chicken, honey, bananas or peanut
butter. A 3-ounce cup of any flavor sells for $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, if you were a dog, you would eat it,'' she said
before adding, ``but it's really bland for humans. Lucy loved it,
and now she is my official delivery dog and vice president of puppy
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Sujdak, a veterinarian at Gainesville Animal Hospital,
said the ice cream is OK for dogs, as long as it is given in
moderation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can cause diarrhea if you give the dog too much, but too
much of anything can do that,'' Sujdak said. He added that greasy,
fatty foods and dairy products are not healthy for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Like many small-business owners, Cohen, who is a full-time
computer analyst at Shands Hospital at the University of Florida,
designed a Web site _ www.pinkbelly.com _ to promote her creation.
More than 75 percent of her sales are generated over the Internet,
and she ships the frozen goodies over dry ice across the country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she has made about $2,000. ``Someone told me you
couldn't launch a product for under $20,000, but here I am,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has plans to expand into a market she says is ``more and
more about empty-nesters, people whose pets have become spoiled
children.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Pink Belly Cafe will open inside the Holistic Pet
Foods store in Gainesville. The cafe will feature ``canine cakes''
and ``mutt muffins.''

   Nicole Skelly, the store's owner, said most of her customers
think the ice cream is a novel idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of her customers think it's wonderful,'' Skelly said. ``A
lot of treats for dogs are just piggy- or animal-based treats, but
this is great. You would not believe the extent people go to in
spoiling their pets, because, even with me, my dog is like my
kid.''

   Cohen's passion for her Ice Pups stretches beyond making it big.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of her profits is donated to animal welfare
organizations in Florida. She also helps put together ``happy
meals'' for newly spayed or neutered pets.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what others thought about ice cream for dogs, she
said her husband, a resident in dental school at UF, is her biggest
critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks I'm a nut,'' she said, flashing a wide smile, ``but
I know he'd retire early to scoop doggy ice cream.''

EXCERPTS FROM LIEBERMAN'S BOOKS 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from two books by Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman. The second, ``In Praise of Public Life,'' was written
with Michael D'Orso.
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Scorpion and the Tarantula''
</P>
<P>
   This is primarily a study of the futile effort to control atomic
energy and prohibit nuclear weapons, but if one is to understand
this failure, it is necessary to consider the histories of the two
principal participants in the effort, Russia and America, and to
reflect on the state of their relations as the Second World War
came to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The first and, in many ways, most critical dimension is space.
America was blessed with natural barriers. To its east and its
west, two great oceans have provided security from attack. Russia,
on the other hand, is exposed. Sitting on a vast plain, there is
nothing of military consequence separating Russia from Asia to the
east and Europe to the west. Russian history from its beginnings to
our own time is characterized by continuous foreign military
assaults, particularly from the west. ...
</P>
<P>
   This is not a history likely to breed a nation of
internationalists, a people who greeted foreigners with openness
and were free of suspicion. This is a history that created a people
haunted by fear, who lived without confidence and viewed the world
outside with a sense of mistrust and inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   From ``In Praise of Public Life''
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence did not plummet overnight. It did not begin
with Bill Clinton. Politicians and government have endured
suspicion and a certain degree of scorn since the birth of this
nation. This skepticism on the part of the American public is a
grand tradition, as deeply rooted in our society as the spirit of
freedom and independence and limited government. What is new,
however, is the degree to which that suspicion and scorn have grown
in the past 30 years. These three decades have seen an
unprecedented parade of betrayals of the public's trust, from the
deception that lay behind the Vietnam War, to the shock of the
Watergate scandal, to Iran-contra and the partisan political and
cultural warfare that erupted in the 1980s, to the personal attacks
on public figures like Judge Robert Bork, Speaker Jim Wright and
Justice Clarence Thomas, to the unseemly revelations of campaign
finance wrongdoing in 1996, and on through the earth shaking
impeachment experience of 1998 and 1999.

 &HT;     BUSH SAYS TEXAS DOESN'T EXECUTE THE RETARDED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 &HT;    By JOHN W. GONZALEZ and POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    OXNARD, Calif. _ Gov. George W. Bush claimed Wednesday that
<TEXT>
Texas doesn't execute mentally retarded killers, although at least
five such convicts have been put to death in recent years.
<P>
   The comment came as the GOP presidential nominee was campaigning
in California, hours before two Texas inmates were executed. One of
the inmates, Oliver D. Cruz, was described as mentally retarded,
though that conclusion was challenged by prosecutors earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Answering news media questions upon his arrival from Texas, Bush
indicated that justice was being served with the executions of Cruz
and a second inmate, Brian Roberson. But when told that several
states have banned the execution of mentally retarded inmates, Bush
said, ``So do we, in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   However, no ban has been approved by Texas lawmakers, although
they tried as recently as 1999 and failed. Bush opposed that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Constraints in existing law, which Bush cited as safeguards,
failed to prevent the execution of five mentally retarded inmates
since 1984 _ six according to those who argue that Cruz was
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anybody tried in the state of Texas, mental capacity is a
factor, not only during the trial phase but during the appellate
phase,'' Bush said. ``... In all cases, mental competency is a
factor in Texas law.''
</P>
<P>
   Queried about his opposition to the 1999 bill to ban executions
of the retarded, Bush insisted Texas' current law is adequate. And
that's the point he was trying to make when he made his
controversial remark, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas law has many safeguards in place to prevent someone who
is not competent from even going to trial, much less being
executed,'' said campaign spokesman Scott McClellan, adding that at
least five laws come into play in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if one juror has reasonable doubts about the defendant's
mental ability to form the intent to commit a crime, then that
person must be acquitted,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's execution of Cruz drew more than the usual
attention on Texas' death chamber, the busiest in the nation. That
is in part because of the debate over executing people with mental
retardation and because of Bush's bid for the presidency, which has
put his positions on crime and punishment under heavy scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's discussion with reporters on the topic ended as he headed
to a campaign event, and he wasn't immediately available to
elaborate. The candidate was making a train tour of portions of
California.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat, was author of the
bill last year that would have banned the execution of inmates with
an IQ of 65 or lower. Ellis said in an interview Wednesday that
Bush told him at the time, ``I think current law is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill passed the Texas Senate, 22-8, it died in a
House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he plans to reintroduce the bill next spring to ban
the execution of anyone with an IQ of 70 or lower and to make it
retroactive to include those on death row now.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 34 mentally retarded offenders with IQs of 70 or
lower have been executed since April 5, 1984, according to the
Death Penalty Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, five were in Texas, not counting Cruz. One man, a
33-year-old black man named Terry Washington, was executed during
Bush's administration. Another mentally retarded offender, Mario
Marquez, was executed roughly 12 hours before Bush was sworn in on
Inauguration Day, Jan. 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of Marquez's retardation was not even allowed to be
presented to the jury. It took a 1989 U.S. Supreme Court decision
to force Texas courts to allow presentation of mitigating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Washington, whose IQ was thought to range between
58 and 69, he was executed on May 6, 1997. He was convicted in the
murder of Beatrice Huling, 29, a night manager at the restaurant
where he worked as a dishwasher. He tied her up with apron strings,
tortured her with a knife and then stabbed her 85 times.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty supporters argue that the Supreme Court has made
it clear that the issue is whether a person is mentally competent
to understand the crime and punishment. As to whether it is moral
to execute mentally retarded people, Dianne Clements of Justice for
All responds, ``The moral standard is don't rape and murder
people.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ellis' bill to ban such executions were to pass next year,
Texas would join 12 other states that do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apparently does not understand the difference between
mental illness, mental retardation and insanity, Ellis said when
told of Bush's remarks on the campaign trail.

<P>
   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon _ Lebanese government forces rolled into
southern Lebanon before dawn Wednesday for the first time in 22
years.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited deployment came two months and two weeks after
Israel withdrew from its costly occupation, but military and
government officials immediately made clear that they had no
intention of deploying Lebanese troops along the border with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the mixed force of 500 soldiers and 500 special police
will act as an internal security force, keeping order among a
population divided between Christians and Shiite Muslims and
preventing old scores from being settled between the Shiite
Hezbollah guerrillas and people who fought for Israel's proxy
militia.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the point, the task force is commanded not by the
army, but by Col. Nazih Abu Nader of the Internal Security Forces,
who reports directly to the interior minister, Michel Murr.
</P>
<P>
   Murr and other Lebanese officials have said repeatedly that the
border is the responsibility of U.N. peacekeepers and that Lebanon
does not want to serve as Israel's border guard.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the government is said to be worried that the close
proximity of the border posts, sometimes only a few yards apart,
might lead to incidents or that Lebanon might be held responsible
if Palestinian or Islamic guerrillas struck into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a defensive force,'' Gen. Elias Farhat, the army
spokesman, said. ``The task is maintaining law and order.''
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of the Lebanese contingent was dependent on the
U.N. peacekeepers taking up border positions last weekend and has
been the subject of weeks of haggling between Lebanon, the United
Nations and Israel, beginning with exactly where the border was.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a telephone call from Damascus, which calls the
shots in Lebanon, President Emile Lahoud gave the go-ahead on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the de facto force on the ground for more than two
months, has pledged not to interfere with the government
authorities. Its forces, with a core of about 500 fighters have
reverted to civilian clothes and are not carrying weapons in
public, although they are planning to keep them hidden away.
</P>
<P>
   But a drive along some of the remote back roads near the border
found Hezbollah fighters in casual clothes with binoculars and
walkie-talkies still manning checkpoints and observation posts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, at Border Post 14, near the village of Rumaysh, where a
U.N. detail from Nepal was originally posted, the only force
visible on the Lebanese side consisted of five young Hezbollah
guerrillas lounging in an old guard post.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, a tall, bearded young man in a baseball hat and
track suit, showed the way up a road to what had been a major
crossing point into Israel, now a tangled wreck of corrugated metal
and old beams. Just ahead of where the pale blue U.N. flag still
flew near an abandoned pile of sandbags, an Israeli backhoe was
busily digging for a new border fence.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Hezbollah men and U.N. officials said the Nepalese had
left at the request of the Lebanese government, which did not want
U.N. forces at the old crossing points. There was no further
explanation of the reasoning behind the order.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment, when it finally came, was made up of mostly
gray-clad Internal Security police and military police, who spent
the day in their new barracks.
</P>
<P>
   The main body is to be based at an old army barracks here in
Marjayoun,, a mostly Christian town, that had been the headquarters
of the South Lebanese Army, Israel's proxy militia. About a third
were sent to Bint Jubail, a predominantly Shiite town farther
south, where one main street is marked by a sculpture of a hand
grenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main impact of the deployment is psychological,'' said a
senior U.N. official. ``It's a really badly needed reassurance for
these people who have been alone too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Qulayah, the Christian village next to Marjayoun, was almost
deserted Wednesday. It had furnished many of the officers and
troops for the SLA and, consequently, many of the 6,000 refugees
who scrambled across the border when Israel abruptly pulled out on
May 24.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, Hezbollah has acted in a remarkably restrained and
disciplined manner, and there has been little in the way of
reprisals. The Christian areas, in particular, where bloodletting
could have revived the passions of the 15-year civil war, have been
left alone.
</P>
<P>
   In the main square of Marjayoun, framed by picturesque stone
buildings and the distinctive cross atop a Greek Orthodox Church,
people waited for the army, barracked just down the road to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are they deployed? We haven't seen anything yet,'' said
George Mandalek, 67, who immediately mentioned his children in
Detroit and Oklahoma City. ``Well, I welcome the army anyway. We
went through a lot of troubled times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected it to be like this,'' he said of the quiet
that has prevailed here since late May. ``That's why those who went
left. They were afraid. The liberation was very calm. To be honest,
nobody expected it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adid Maalouf, 80 and a fit-looking retired soldier, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a more genteel atmosphere,'' he said.
``We went through times when everything was turned upside down. But
now everything is calm.
</P>
<P>
   But Jean Mandalek, George's twin brother, took a dimmer view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody goes back to the root of the problem,'' he said. ``The
Palestinians came here, they massacred and burned. Then the
Israelis came and did the same. Since May, what has the government
done?
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here, how can they live, what will they do?'' he
asked. ``Nothing has happened.''

CALIFORNIA VINTNERS' FORECAST BETTER-THAN-AVERAGE HARVEST 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB KLOSE   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ The annual northern California grape
harvest and crush is under way, and first-blush reviews indicate
the state's premium wine industry is headed for a
better-than-average year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off to a very good start,'' said Rob McNeil, director of
winemaking at Mumm Napa Valley in Napa County.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil said workers on Tuesday morning began harvesting pinot
noir grapes for sparkling wines at two vineyards in Yountville. The
grapes were taken to Mumm Napa Valley's winery in Rutherford, where
the annual crush was begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fruit is very clean and looks good, and early indications
are we're looking at a harvest of normal quantity at the worst,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mumm Napa Valley launched its harvest five days behind
Schramsberg Vineyards in Calistoga, where workers on Friday began
harvesting pinot for sparkling wine.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, workers began harvesting chardonnay at Guenoc and
Langtry Vineyards, which straddles Lake and Napa counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked about a ton and a half just to see what's going
on,'' said vineyard manager Bill Pickering. ``We'll probably get
started again on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Korbel Winery began crushing sparkling wine grapes from its
Sacramento Valley vineyards on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Area vintners consistently predicted at least an average harvest
_ and possibly better than average _ despite damage suffered by
some vineyards from late spring rains and a severe heat wave in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside the heat wave and the rain during the spring bloom,
this has been a perfect growing season,'' said McNeil at Mumm Napa
Valley. ``We had a cooler than normal July, which bodes well, too,
for steady development of flavor for the grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Optaz, outgoing president of the Sonoma County Grape
Growers Association and vineyard manager for Clos Du Bois in
Alexander Valley, said the spring rain and heat wave could shave 10
percent to 15 percent off the total tonnage for Sonoma County. But
what growers lost to the weather will be made up by the increased
number of acres now in cultivation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be the largest tonnage crop we have seen in Sonoma
County,'' Optaz said.

<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Vice President Al Gore and his new Democratic
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, introduced each other to the
folks back home on Wednesday in a pair of appearances that sought
to ground two men with disparate stories in the common embrace of
family and community.
</P>
<P>
   The day began in Carthage, Tenn., the picturesque town on the
Cumberland plateau that served as one of Gore's two boyhood homes,
the other being Washington, D.C. Gore and his wife, Tipper, gave
Lieberman and his family a tour of the house they have owned in
Carthage since 1973 and then dropped by the farm where he spent his
childhood summers and where his 87-year-old mother, Pauline, still
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as campaign cameras recorded the scene for possible use in
television advertisements, longtime friends and constituents sang
Gore's praises during a scripted gathering in an elementary school
gymnasium. On Wednesday afternoon, the Gores and Liebermans flew
here to Stamford, where Lieberman returned the favor by joining the
Gores at a raucous rally with local supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a thrill to come home to Stamform on Air Force II,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Carthage, Gore vowed that he and Lieberman would not level
personal attacks against Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
nominee, and his running mate, Dick Cheney. ``I will not say a
single unkind word about Gov. Bush or Dick Cheney,'' Gore said,
affecting his twangiest drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how Gore will define ``unkind word'' remains to be seen,
and his pledge was greeted with skepticism by Bush's aides. They
noted that Gore has used loaded terms like ``reckless,'' ``risky,''
``irresponsible,'' ``smug'' and ``arrogant'' to describe Bush's
policies. And indeed, only seconds before making his pledge, Gore
referred to the Republican ticket as ``the old guard.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation with reporters aboard Air Force II en route to
Connecticut, Gore said he had ``never made a personal attack
against Governor Bush.'' He then said he had once ``slipped'' when,
in May, he called Bush's Social Security proposals arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made a similar pledge in the primaries, saying he would not
make any negative personal attacks against his Democratic opponent,
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey. However, Gore proved quite
skillful at casting Bradley in derogatory terms without calling him
names, although he did call him a ``quitter'' for leaving the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, said that ``if the vice
president meant what he said, it would be a breakthrough
encouraging development.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 52, was born in Washington, where his father served in the
House and Senate, and he attended all but a portion of one year of
his schooling there. But he spent his summers on his parents' farm
in Carthage and he has returned there to kick off his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The event in Carthage on Wednesday was so prepackaged that,
hours beforehand, Gore aides handed out biographies of the
townspeople who Gore called on to speak. Many told stories of
medical problems _ a child with cancer, a kidney transplant _ and
paid tribute to Gore for riding to the rescue with helpful
legislation during his 16 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One man, Mark Thompson, of Cleveland, Tenn., told of riding his
bicycle as a boy to deliver a letter to then Representative Gore
seeking help in securing Social Security benefits for his
grandmother. And as Thompson credited Gore for fixing the problem,
he incorporated the campaign's theme of the week _ ``going the
distance for America's working families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Vice President, in 1989 you went the distance for my
family,'' he said. ``And I know in November when you're elected
president of the United States you're going to go the distance for
families all across this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded, ``We need to get you to come on the campaign
trail,'' as if that were not exactly where Thompson was on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The only comment that was off script on Wednesday came from
Laura Lester, a 55-year-old retired teacher who asked Lieberman
about his support for school vouchers. Lieberman supports pilot
programs that would provide federal funds to the parents of poor
children to pay for tuition at private schools, one of several
areas where he disagrees with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman used the question to blunt Bush campaign
attacks about their differences on various issues, as they have in
several interviews in the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Lieberman said, ``the folks on the other side are
trying to point out the differences between Al and me and, believe
me, the differences are very, very few.'' Lieberman said the two
candidates did have some differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one,'' he said of vouchers. ``And I think it's a mark
of the strength of leadership of this man that he didn't choose
somebody who agreed with him on every single issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he would occasionally offer dissenting advice to
Gore but would ``support him wholeheartedly'' once a decision was
made. Then Gore jumped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to have a vice president who disagrees with me
on some issues,'' he said. ``I think that's fine. Our
administration will be opposed to private school vouchers. I'm
against them. I think they drain money away from public schools.
But I'll tell you this.'' I think it is a strength and not a
weakness, an asset and not a liability to be able to have a
different point of view represented in the room at the time that
decisions are being made.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman addressed another issue where they differ,
parental consent and notification for minors seeking abortions, in
a morning television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who supports abortion rights, said on NBC's Today
that he would support legislation giving parents the right to be
notified about or to consent to a minor child's abortion, but only
if it contained provisions allowing the child to seek permission
from a judge ``when it can't be worked out in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who also supports abortion rights, has always opposed
parental consent legislation, aides said, but he said on Air Force
II that he had expressed ``a willingness to look at proposals''
that do not impinge on a woman's right to choose. Gore aides later
said Gore was only talking about parental notification, not
parental consent, and that he had never seen a notification bill
with adequate protections.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Pat Buchanan arrived here Wednesday full of
optimism and bravado, predicting that he would claim the Reform
Party presidential nomination, despite a bitter split that could
leave the party nominating not one, but two, candidates for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Forces allied for and against Buchanan tried several times
Wednesday to resolve their differences but the split remained so
profound that a settlement by the opening gavel on Thursday was
highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on our way,'' Buchanan said on his arrival to a
cheering crowd of 100 supporters at his hotel. ``We will give you
the fight of our lives. This convention belongs to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's rival for the nomination, John Hagelin, made no
public appearances here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the two sides met briefly in the morning, then again
in the afternoon, to consider the possibility of a settlement. But
talks broke off without a resolution. Officials on both sides said
they did not expect a breakthrough before the convention opened.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves each side to plot its own course over the next
several days and beyond _ all with an eye toward the $12.6 million
in federal campaign funds to which the party nominee is entitled.
</P>
<P>
   The party effectively split during a meeting of national
committee members on Tuesday, when opponents of Buchanan, about a
quarter of the 120 attending, stormed out of the room, charging
that his supporters had stolen control of the party. Those who
remained branded the protesters as sore losers, even as those who
left set up a national committee and an executive committee of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the absence of any conciliation made it clear that
both sides were digging in, wholly resistant to any opposing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   In dueling news conferences, each side used different criteria
to make its case for legitimacy, and in the surest sign yet that
the party was operating along parallel tracks, the anti-Buchanan
group registered its delegates at a table in the Long Beach
Convention Center lobby, after which the pro-Buchanan forces
registered theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, if there was any point of agreement, it was
this: A continuing split would almost guarantee that the ultimate
arbiters would be the Federal Election Commission, and in all
likelihood, a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   With the 596 convention delegates arriving Wednesday, the
question was not so much which candidate, Buchanan or Hagelin,
would receive the campaign money as much as which ruling group was
legitimately in control of the party and, by extension, the
convention, which ends on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   By sheer numbers, the Buchanan side seemed to hold an advantage.
Gerry Moan, the party chairman whose stewardship of the national
committee meeting precipitated the walkout, said that his control
of $2.5 million in federal money to stage the convention made him
and his followers _ almost all of them Buchanan supporters _ the
rightful claimants to authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say anything they wish,'' Moan said of his opponents.
``But I am the chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bay Buchanan, the candidate's sister and chief
strategist, said that by her count, Buchanan had control of 410
delegates, more than enough to defeat Hagelin, should it come to
that. In the Reform Party, a candidate can ask that the primary
vote, a monthlong process that concludes this week, be set aside in
favor of a delegate vote.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Buchanan forces contended that they represented a
majority of the party's original 11-member executive committee and
had proof that, as part of the primary balloting process, Buchanan
violated party rules by sending ballots to ineligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Moan and the Buchanan campaign of ``brown-shirt
tactics'' that included physical assaults on party members on
Tuesday, Jim Mangia, the party secretary, said that as far as his
side was concerned, Buchanan was disqualified from the primary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mangia said, Moan's side had acknowledged the
authority of the executive committee that Mangia is now running, by
voting on Tuesday to void any actions that committee takes.
</P>
<P>
   Moan dismissed that contention, saying, ``Their executive
committee is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Verney, the party's founding chairman who is now aligned
with the forces opposed to Buchanan, predicted that the warring
factions would not find accommodation, making it all but certain
the party would make dual requests to the election commission for
the campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   That, Verney said, could work to his side's advantage if the
election commission chooses to investigate charges that Buchanan's
campaign submitted illegal names.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point,'' Verney said, referring to the six commission
members, ``they are going to have to go back and look at the many
activities that have gone on.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and his sister spoke as if the federal money was
already on the way to them. Speaking to reporters, Bay Buchanan
said she expected that her campaign would receive the money within
three weeks, an inevitability the other side has not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, I would have hoped these people would have heard the
fat lady sing 30 days ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the Buchanan campaign had plans to use almost all
the federal money on a media campaign, mostly radio, starting after
Labor Day and aiming at specific states, which she declined to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   By that strategy, she said, Buchanan's popularity would begin to
rise from as little as 1 percent in some recent polls to double
digits, an ascent that would almost surely affect the fortunes of
the Republican ticket of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   That effort, she added, would be immeasurably aided if a court
rules that Buchanan, and perhaps the other leading third-party
candidate, Ralph Nader of the Green Party, should be allowed to
participate in the presidential debates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debates are critical,'' Bay Buchanan said. ``I'm hoping
that we can just start clicking, get into the debates and win this
election, even.''

INVESTORS SHOW APPROVAL OF MERGER BY PHONE.COM AND SOFTWARE.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dot-com mania has not died.
</P>
<P>
   Phone.com and Software.com, two relatively small, money-losing
software companies, announced they were merging Wednesday, and
investors responded by adding $2.6 billion to their combined market
values.
</P>
<P>
   The ``.com'' suffix in both companies' names, moreover, is
somewhat misleading, as neither does business through its Web site.
Software.com sells software that Internet service providers, like
AT&AMP;T Worldnet, use to operate their electronic mail systems.
Phone.com has developed a tiny browser program that allows wireless
telephones to view specially formatted Internet sites. The browser
is free, but Phone.com makes money selling software used by
purveyors of sites meant for the wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have no overlapping products, and the main thing
they have in common is that they both sell their products primarily
to telephone companies. In the future, however, the companies were
primed to become more direct competitors. They were both developing
products allowing telephone companies to offer unified messaging
services, in which voice messages, faxes, electronic mail and so on
are all collected into a single place and then distributed to the
device of the user's choice, be it a computer, a telephone or a
wireless gadget.
</P>
<P>
   This opportunity appeared to be compelling enough to Donald J.
Listwin, a Software.com board member who was, until Tuesday, also
an executive vice president of Cisco Systems, that he proposed that
he run the combined company last week amid the final negotiations
between Phone.com and Software.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approached folks and said you may need help pulling off a
complex merger and how do you feel about my joining the team,''
Listwin said yesterday. He knew the new firm's customers because at
Cisco he managed the business of selling Internet network hardware
to telephone companies and service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Listwin will become president and chief executive. Alain
Rossman, the chief executive of Phone.com, will become chairman and
executive vice president. John L. MacFarlane, the chief executive
of Software.com, will be an executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   MacFarlane's consolation prize for giving up the chief executive
spot is that his shares are now worth $710 million. Rossman's
shares are worth a mere $336 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new company has not been named, but will either be
Software.com or Phone.com. The combined company will be
headquartered in Redwood City, the Silicon Valley home of
Phone.com; Software.com has been based in Santa Barbara. None of
the combined company's 1,500 employees will be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have ridden a roller coaster in the stock market,
but unlike most purveyors of Web sites and online stores, they
still enjoyed the sort of stock market values unheard of in the
pre-Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   Phone.com's shares have ranged between $27.50 and $208 in the
last year, and were $78 on Tuesday, before the deal was announced,
giving it a value of $6.1 billion. Software.com's shares ranged
between $22 and $155, closing Monday at $107.75 giving it a value
of $5.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At best, investors were betting on the companies rapid growth,
rather than their current financial performance. In the most recent
quarter, Phone.com lost $166 million on sales of $28.7 million.
Software.com lost $11 million on sales of $29.5 million. Listwin
said he hopes the company can achieve $1 billion in annual sales in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of overlapping operations, investors appeared
to view the merger as accelerating that growth. Software.com's
shares increased $34.6875, to $142.4375. Phone.com's shares jumped
$13.625, to $91.1225.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stock is not trading on fundamentals,'' said Mark
Fernandes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``There is a great deal
of enthusiasm about the synergies coming from this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger agreement provided that shareholders of each company
would own half of the combined entity, meaning that Phone.com is
paying a premium to Software.com shareholders.

EX-FBI AGENT'S POSSIBLE ROLE IN FOUR SLAYINGS PROBED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal investigation of FBI wrongdoing is focusing
on whether retired FBI agent John J. Connolly Jr. provoked the
slayings of four government informants by alerting gangsters James
``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen Flemmi that the informants were
cooperating against them, according to sources familiar with the
probe.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury that indicted Connolly and his longtime
informants, Bulger and Flemmi on federal racketeering charges in
December is considering additional charges against the three men
and others, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a team of federal agents have been questioning many
retired agents from the FBI's Boston office about the slayings of
Richard Castucci, Louis Litif, Brian Halloran, and John McIntyre,
each of whom had given the FBI information about Bulger and Flemmi
or fellow members of the Winter Hill gang, based in nearby
Somerville, in the weeks before their deaths, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Castucci, 47, a nightclub owner, was found shot in the head and
wrapped in a sleeping bag in the trunk of his Cadillac behind the
Northgate Shopping Center in Revere, just outside Boston, on Dec.
30, 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The case remained unsolved until last year, when confessed
hitman-turned-government witness John Martorano, formerly of the
Winter Hill gang, admitted Castucci was among 20 people he killed _
and fingered Bulger and Flemmi in the slaying as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has learned that Castucci had been an FBI informant
for about a year before he was slain and had told the FBI that
Joseph McDonald _ a Winter Hill gang enforcer _ was hiding out near
Greenwich Village in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, McDonald was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list for
fleeing after his arrest for the 1971 heist of a rare stamp
collection. McDonald vanished after a key witness in the case was
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Castucci's tip failed to lead agents to McDonald. But two weeks
after the Boston FBI office filed a detailed internal report on his
cooperation in the fugitive case, Castucci was slain, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Tracy A. Miner, who represents Connolly, said her
client had nothing to do with the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Connolly never told Bulger or Flemmi about any
informant,'' Miner said. ``Castucci was not John Connolly's
informant and he had no knowledge that Castucci was an informant.''
</P>
<P>
   Former FBI Supervisor John Morris, who admitted he pocketed
$7,000 in bribes from Bulger and Flemmi and told them about
investigations, was assigned to the stamp theft case. Morris, who
has immunity in exchange for his testimony against Bulger and his
crew, has also been questioned recently about the slayings of the
informants, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, a star agent who retired in 1990, is charged with
tipping Bulger and Flemmi to investigations. Bulger and Flemmi are
the subjects of two federal racketeering indictments: one returned
in January 1995 and another filed last year that accuses them of
controlling bookmaking, drug dealing and loan-sharking operations
around the city under Connolly's protection.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger has been a fugitive since 1995 and Flemmi, known in mob
circles as ``the rifleman,'' remains jailed while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   After Martorano fingered Bulger and Flemmi in Castucci's
slaying, Castucci's children vowed to file a multimillion dollar
wrongful death suit against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John McBride, who represents the Castuccis, said the
family was unaware that Castucci was an FBI informant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming that to be accurate,'' McBride said, ``then that
further enhances the likelihood of success that the Castucci family
would have in their suit against the government for its egregious
misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride described Castucci, owner of the Ebb Tide Lounge, as a
bookmaker and gambler who was ambushed on an errand to collect some
winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Litif _ whose death is also the focus of the current grand jury
probe _ had been an informant for Connolly for about 15 years
before he was slain.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old bookmaker-turned-drug dealer was out on bail for
the murder of another bookie when his body was found April 13,
1980. Litif had been shot in the head, wrapped in plastic and
stuffed in the trunk of his car in the South End.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran, a third informant whose murder is now under intense
investigation, implicated Bulger and Flemmi in the slaying of Litif
and others, including a Tulsa millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran claimed he dropped Litif off at Triple O's bar in South
Boston, waited outside during the execution, then helped Bulger and
one of his associates get rid of the body. The FBI deemed Halloran
unreliable and refused to cut a deal with him. He was subsequently
gunned down, along with a friend, on May 11, 1982 as he left a bar
on Boston's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre, 32, the fourth slain informant, vanished in November
1984, six weeks after the FBI learned that he had implicated Bulger
and Flemmi in an ill-fated plot to ship guns to the Irish
Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre's fate remained unknown until January, when Kevin Weeks
_ a top Bulger deputy _ led investigators to a makeshift grave in
the city's Dorchester section containing the bodies of McIntyre and
two other victims.
</P>
<P>
   When pleading guilty to racketeering charges last month after
striking a deal with prosecutors, Weeks acknowledged that Bulger
and Flemmi killed McIntyre and Halloran after learning they were
informants. He also said he was the ``lookout'' when Halloran was
ambushed and that he helped bury McIntyre's body.

MEMORIES OF FORCE RECALL SPUR FIRESTONE TO ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TIRE-RECALL) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bridgestone/Firestone announced a recall on Wednesday of
some 6.5 million Firestone tires, it was the company's first
admission that the tires could pose a danger. But it was also a
first step toward damage control.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years is a long time, but memories of how a
government-mandated recall in the 1970s nearly bankrupted Firestone
Tire &AMP; Rubber _ the company's name before Japan's Bridgestone Corp.
bought it in 1988 _ clearly resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oral history around here is that we were a lot too slow to
cooperate back then,'' said Christine Karbowiak, a Firestone
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the company is recalling the tires without being
forced _ though it withstood a week of withering news articles
before acting. It has established a hot line for worried drivers,
and it is offering to replace _ with virtually no questions asked _
the affected tires, regardless of how long they have been on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Firestone is trying to define the
problem as narrowly as possible, so that its brand is not tarnished
as a whole. Though the recall includes all 15-inch Radial ATX and
Radial ATX II tires, the focus is on Wilderness AT tires made at a
plant in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are isolating this so that, in the consumer's mind, this
isn't a problem with Firestone tires, but a problem with 15-inch
Wilderness tires made in a particular plant in Decatur,'' said
Stephen Girsky, a tire industry analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``If they can keep this controlled and isolated, it won't
have a significant long-term impact on their sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, plaintiffs' lawyers who have filed lawsuits blaming the
tires for serious injuries say Firestone has been stonewalling. In
settling several lawsuits over the last year, the company has
insisted that the lawyers and their clients not talk about the
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask them for documents, they say sure, as long as you sign
the usual protective order,'' said Henry Wallace, a lawyer
representing an injured client in Florida. ``Well, I won't sign,
and other lawyers shouldn't either. My research shows there are at
least 31 cases that are astoundingly similar to mine, and I should
have access to their information.''
</P>
<P>
   Karbowiak, the Firestone spokeswoman, said it was common in
business litigation to keep settlement agreements private.
</P>
<P>
   The company also finds itself in less than total agreement with
its customer of 100 years, the Ford Motor Co., millions of whose
Explorer sport utility vehicles are equipped with the Firestone
tires involved in the recall.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Wednesday, Firestone and Ford offered
contradictory advice about the optimum pressure for the tires.
Firestone recommended 30 pounds per square inch; Ford suggested
anywhere between 26 and 30 would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   The difference reflected the contrasting interests of automakers
and tire makers. Automakers advise customers to keep tires fairly
soft because this makes the ride less bouncy. That is particularly
true for sport utility vehicles, which have stiff truck suspensions
but are increasingly purchased by people more accustomed to the
ride of a car.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But soft tires, with more of their surface area in contact with
the road, suffer more wear, so tiremakers favor keeping their
products inflated at higher pressure. ``Underinflated tires
deteriorate more rapidly than tires that are properly maintained
and are at an increased risk of tread separation, blowout or other
failure,'' Firestone said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting advice prefigures what are likely to be two
crucial chapters in the episode: first, the government's
determination of why the tires are failing, and then the
apportionment of blame and financial responsibility. More
immediately, it spurred expressions of frustration from plaintiffs'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``So now what is the consumer supposed to do?'' asked Tab
Turner, a lawyer in Little Rock who has 10 lawsuits filed against
both companies.
</P>
<P>
   What had been a quiet issue for Firestone and Ford began to turn
into a storm in February, when someone who had been injured in an
accident involving a Ford Explorer with Firestone tires contacted
KHOU, a Houston tlevision station. The station ran a segment on
possible problems with the tires. Slowly, other stations picked up
on the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that piece ran in Houston, we'd had maybe 30 or 40
complaints in 10 years,'' said Liz Neblett, a spokeswoman for the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. By the time the
agency opened its investigation on May 2, it had 90 complaints of
injuries related to ATX or Wilderness tires on Ford Explorers; as
of Wednesday morning, there were 270.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, whenever a story runs, there's another bump in the
complaints,'' Neblett said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The flood of lawsuits seems unlikely to abate. The American
Trial Lawyers Association has organized a litigation group around
the Firestone tires, in which lawyers representing can compare
notes, and perhaps consolidate suits.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Those lawyers are sure to resist the company's efforts to define
the problem narrowly. Both Firestone and Ford said on Wednesday
that evidence pointed to tires made at the Decatur plant as the
focus of further investigation. But Turner and other lawyers took
issue with Firestone's plan to replace Wilderness tires made in
Decatur with similar tires from other plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 35-year-old quadriplegic client on a ventilator,
who got that way when a 1997 Ford Explorer rolled over after a rear
tire separation,'' Turner said. ``That tire was made in Wilson,
N.C., one of the plants that is supposed to provide those safe
replacement tires.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the case against the tires may not be cut and dried.
The same tires have been used on sport utility vehicles made by
General Motors, Toyota and other manufacturers without a
particularly high incidence of failure. Likewise, from 1995 through
1997, many Ford Explorers used Goodyear tires without undue
problems with tread separations, said Chuck Sinclair, a Goodyear
spokesman. Moreover, Ford Explorers running on Firestone tires in
cold-weather states do not seem to fail more often than other
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Experts assessing the information available so far suspect that
it is the combination of a burning sun, Ford Explorers, Firestone
tires and drivers' failure to properly inflate them that can prove
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   When a tire is underinflated, there is more flexing in the
sidewall, which generates more heat. If the vehicle is carrying
lots of people, lots of luggage or an otherwise heavy load, the
friction gets worse. Add hot weather and a hot road, and tire
temperature can get critical. A good tire can generally endure
temperatures as high as 210 degrees without an accident. But at 220
degrees, it can start to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, even the best drivers often lose control of
their vehicles. In such circumstances, the Explorer, with its high
center of gravity, is more likely to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``These vehicles are used by a lot of different people, in lots
of driving conditions, and a lot of the ways they use it can lead
to tire failure,'' said Marvin Bozarth, executive director of the
International Tire and Rubber Association. ``I can probably walk
out and spot five Explorers in half an hour that are running on
underinflated tires. And if they are full of 200-pound people with
all their luggage, the tires will heat up tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is ultimately held accountable, the companies with the
most to gain are Firestone's competitors. Firestone may not have
the capacity to manufacture as many free replacement tires as it
needs for the recall; the company said Wednesday it would buy
competitor's products if necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, tire companies are not using Firestone's woes as an
opportunity to claim market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firestone may be bearing the lion's share of the burden, but
something like this is bad for the entire industry,'' said
Goodyear's Sinclair. Indeed, Karbowiak, the Firestone spokeswoman,
said she got a note from her counterpart at one competitive
company, offering sympathy and asking how she could help.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other companies certainly will not turn sales away.
Sinclair noted that Goodyear has been ``looking into our inventory
and our manufacturing capabilities, to make sure we can meet
customer demand.'' Indeed, analysts expect that Firestone's
competitors have much to gain and little to lose by keeping
low-profiles right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tire recalls happen all the time, and they know what goes
around comes around, that if they go after Firestone brutally on
this one, Firestone will go after them on the next,'' Gwirsky of
Morgan Stanley said. ``And they'll probably gain share by default,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors clearly think so. On July 31, just before stories in
USA Today called national attention to the problems, Bridgestone
shares traded in Tokyo for 2515 yen; Wednesday, they closed at
2075, a drop of 17 percent. By contrast, Goodyear's shares have
gone up 18 percent in the same period, closing on Wednesday at $23
9/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that Goodyear's stock is moving on the new potential
for market share gains,'' said Ephraim Levy, a tire industry
analyst with S&AMP;P Equity Group.

 &HT;    Democrats downplay differences
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Vice President Al Gore and his new running
mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), took their campaign on the
road Wednesday, beginning the tricky task of fashioning a unified
ticket out of political positions that have not always been in
sync.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign stops in Gore's hometown, Carthage, Tenn., and
Lieberman's boyhood home, Stamford, Conn., the Democrats papered
over the political differences they have had over the years and
portrayed themselves as ideological soul mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand this relationship,'' Lieberman told Gore
supporters in Carthage, near where the vice president launched his
congressional career in 1974. ``Believe me, when President Gore
decides, Vice President Lieberman will support him
wholeheartedly.'' Gore, a Southern Baptist whose father was a
Tennessee senator, showed Lieberman and his family around the farm
he still owns. Later, Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew whose father owned
a liquor store, took the Gores to a rally in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting in Carthage, Lieberman told longtime Gore
supporters that Carthage, a rural Southern town of 2,400, reminded
him of Stamford, a wealthy bedroom community near New York City,
because people ``care about each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In answer to a pointed question from a member of the National
Education Association, the politically vocal teacher's union, about
his support for public school vouchers, a position opposed by Gore
and the powerful education lobby, Lieberman signalled his
willingness to follow Gore's lead: ``If you want to get me off this
idea, the best thing to do is elect the Gore-Lieberman ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on NBC's ``Today'' show, Lieberman defended his position
that parental consent for minors seeking abortions should be
required in some instances.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is adamantly opposed to that. Dan Gerstein, a Lieberman
aide, said the senator supported parental consent only if it
allowed for certain exceptions, such as the health of the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, he's pro-choice,'' Gerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's ``Larry King Live'' the night before, Lieberman
downplayed comments he has made about potential advantages of
privatizing some portions of the Social Security system. Gore has
been sharply critical of privatizing Social Security and has
accused George W. Bush of jeopardizing the program by proposing
that workers be allowed to invest in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's comment on CNN prompted criticism from the Bush
campaign Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that Senator Lieberman hasn't changed his position on
Social Security to clear the way for Al Gore to attack George Bush
for a position Senator Lieberman supports,'' said Dan Bartlett, a
Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman accused the Bush campaign of exaggerating the
differences between him and Gore. ``The other side has been trying
to point out differences between Al and me,'' Lieberman said in
Carthage. ``The differences are very, very few. We share values, we
share a vision for the country, and our voting records are almost
exactly the same, but there are some things on which we disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also sought to portray their political differences as a
selling point. ``I'm not afraid to have a vice president who
disagrees with me on some issues,'' Gore told his hometown crowd.
``I think it is a strength and not a weakness, an asset and not a
liability to be able to have a different point of view represented
in the room when decisions are being made.''

   SAGAPONACK, N.Y. _ David Seeler is a practical man. When the
landscape architect needed 25,000 tons of fill to build a ha-ha, or
hidden fence, down the road from his house here, he decided to give
his wife a pond for her 55th birthday.

   ``We have an expression around here,'' he said, watching the
bulldozers mold the S-shaped quarter-acre pond taking shape behind
the house. ``Moderation is for monks.''

sunken fence or ditch used to keep the cows at a picturesque
distance from the manor house. The cows appeared to be grazing on
the greensward, but a wide ditch kept them from trampling the lawn
and mooing at the guests.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to the Hamptons, where for 30 years Seeler has run
the Bayberry Nursery, a garden center in Amagansett, and shaped the
land for its summer stars: Paul Simon, Ralph Lauren, Edward Albee,
Helmut Lang, Alfonso Ossorio, and others less famous but even
better at making money. Though Seeler's own homes (one here, one in
Amagansett and one planned for a sand dune in Montauk) reflect a
natural restraint and sensitivity to the land, his clients may want
the scrub oak forest turned into a stroll garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out here so long, I've seen a lot of my gardens
ripped out by new owners,'' said Seeler, who is 58. ``Or many
times, the gardens are consumed by the house, which is four times
the size of the old one. That's a heartbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   He tells of an elderly couple who were talked into a $1.4
million expansion of a house ``to protect their investment.'' They
told him, ``The architect talked us into it.'' He keeps asking
clients who think they want a fabulous landscape, who's going to
mow, weed, spray, do the pool? ``They buy a summer retreat and then
they're never alone.'' They want it all anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much money around, people don't know what to do
with it,'' he said. ``The amount of business I did my entire first
year in 1970, I do now the first four days in April.''
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of 18th-century park-building going on in the
flat fields and scrub oak woods around here _ even for something as
simple as a pool fence, that modern-day requirement to prevent
being sued for accidental drowning. (A maddening regulation,
really, when a whole ocean glints a few fields away, crashing
fenceless at the feet of little children. But you can't sue the
ocean.)
</P>
<P>
   When his neighbor on Sagaponack Road needed a pool fence, Seeler
built a berm, a kind of ha-ha in reverse. He brought in enough fill
_ from his just-dug pond _ to raise an earthwork around the house
and pool. Then he buttressed it with a stone wall. Voila, wandering
children, like cows, are kept out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now you can look straight out, forever,'' Seeler said,
standing on his artificial plateau and sweeping his arm toward the
wildflower meadow his wife, Ngaere (pronounced NYE-ree) Macray,
planted a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She's the one who got a pond in return. It backs on the Sagg
Swamp Nature Preserve, so nearby nesting herons can wade in the
shallow waters, which deepen to seven feet in the center. Macray
bought the property 20 years ago, with her first husband, Arnold
Zohn, when it was still 40 acres of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a house that felt like an 18th-century farm,'' she
said. ``Something that was added onto, like the old farmhouses
were, as people's needs grew. If you forgot something _ for the
horse, the dog, the parakeet _ you just added it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugene L. Futterman, the architect who had the rare ability to
suspend his ego and draw someone else's dream, built the house
before his death in 1987; Seeler laid out the gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me the elevations and the spaces,'' said Macray, who
grew up in England, in gardens with ``bones,'' or architectural
elements that flow. Here the bones show in garden rooms at
pleasingly different levels, including one made of clipped beech
and empty except for a bench.
</P>
<P>
   They planted a giant oval of beech trees, started by Macray from
sprouted beechnuts sent through the mail by her English mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the trees grow up, their branches will meet to form a
cathedral,'' Macray said, standing inside the grassy nave, where
her beloved dogs and cats are buried and where she and Seeler want
their ashes scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Come summer, they rent out their winter house and move into
cooler, calmer quarters behind Bayberry Nursery. Seeler grew up in
Huntington, with summers on West Gilgo Beach, and never got the
sand out of his shoes. So after earning a master's degree in
landscape architecture from the University of Georgia, and working
for six years, he came out to Amagansett, bought the nursery in
1971, and two years later, eight acres of land for $59,000.
</P>
<P>
   The land had been stripped of its topsoil, so he rebuilt the
soil with tons of compost. That barren wasteland is now the
Disney-like show grounds for wealthy clients, who can look at
baby-elephant garden ornaments ($2,700) and 10-ton, $36,000 beech
trees, or rest themselves on an Adirondack chair (only $140) by the
quarter-acre pond Seeler built for clients who need to sit down
while they add up their landscape costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people use this like a public park,'' Seeler said,
flopping into a chair to eat his lunch. ``I've always wanted a
garden center that was more garden than center.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be stretching it a bit, but there are some beautiful
specimens here, like the 8-foot, 75-year-old Hinoki cypress that
has grown only two feet in 25 years. ``I'm going to will that to
Longwood Gardens when I die,'' Seeler said of the showplace created
by Pierre S. du Pont in southeastern Pennsylvania. And you can get
lots of ideas, like growing grapevines, with real grapes up a
whimsical dovecote made by the artist Michael Ince.
</P>
<P>
   This is also where Seeler rejuvenates venerable old plants his
clients tell him to haul off to the dump: like Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg's boxwoods, or a 45-year-old, espaliered apple tree.
Then he sells them to just the right person.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked behind the nursery is the Seeler-Macray summer home.
Seeler replaced the flat roof of the one-story house with a tall,
swooping Thai-like roof, with a four-foot overhang that allows them
to keep the windows open in the rain (to hear it, smell it, feel a
breeze). It also shades the house in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Glass doors to the bedroom and open living room offer views on
one side of a simple courtyard and pool, and on the other of a
secluded meadow, punctuated a few large native cedars.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many rooms do you need?'' Seeler said, showing how the
two-sided fireplace serves both the great room and the bedroom. In
the morning, he rolls out of bed into his Zen-like courtyard for a
swim.
</P>
<P>
   Seeler tries to bring this light touch to the gardens he designs
for his clients. ``I try to find out what their dream is,'' he
said. ``It can be a pond. A super garden. The play area they never
had as a child.'' Then again, ``some people have no dream,'' he
said. ``They just want it decorated.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is a manicured, parklike quality to many of the gardens,
perhaps because the plants are set in place all at once, rather
than evolving through the years. Sometimes, the best Seeler can do
is to save people from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite jobs have been for clients who are sensitive to the
land, or the spirit of an old house like Pudding Hall, the
turn-of-the-century dinosaur on the corner of Main Street and Woods
Lane in East Hampton. The monster of gables and shingles used to
command a view of the town pond, from an estate twice its present
size, full of towering beeches and cryptomeria.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1886 for the founder of the Maidstone Club in East
Hampton, the house was a wreck when the new owners bought it two
years ago. There was blue vinyl over the leaky roof and trees were
sorely neglected.
</P>
<P>
   As the house was restored, Seeler developed a Victorian
landscape to go with it. Taking his cues from the great old
surviving trees, he practiced the ``less is more'' principle. He
left a sprawling old juniper lounging over the front lawn, and
planted a hedge on the other side with Caroline Kennedy's
born-again boxwoods (they had spent six years at Bayberry
recuperating).
</P>
<P>
   He planted a hedge of holly and a little grove of cryptomeria to
match the old ones on Woods Lane, and edged the northern dark side
of the house with white Annabelle hydrangeas. A perennial garden
spills over with blue Nikko and white Peegee hydrangeas, Anthony
Waterer spireas and burning bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``All period old East Hampton plants,'' Seeler said. ``At these
old houses, you only find things that flowered during `the
season.'''
</P>
<P>
   He left a few old cedars, covered with ivy and porcelain vine,
to avoid looking too manicured.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients, like the real estage agent Tina Fredericks, have
spent a lifetime honing a dream. Her house, on Georgica Pond in
East Hampton, rises like a lighthouse out of the briar patch. She
bought the land 25 years ago, when she realized she was selling
property to everyone but herself. She made paths through the wild
bayberry and shadblow to a little bench facing the pond. ``I wanted
to built a Japanese teahouse, but the town doesn't allow an
accessory structure without a house,'' she said. So finally,
working with a young designer, Kenton van Boer, she built two
towers, all cedar shingles and glass, that rise like trees, out of
a sloping foundation of stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, if you could drop a house down from a helicopter, you
wouldn't have to wreck the natural landscape,'' Seeler said. But
this house wasn't dropped. So he has had to use a little theater,
such as attaching dead bittersweet vines, as thick as a wrist,
along the new rock walls as a natural trellis for wisteria. He
yanked a mature climbing hydrangea off a Bayberry wall and used
that and that recycled, espaliered apple tree to give the new walls
an old look. He planted native witch hazel, viburnums and native
azaleas to draw nature back up to the house.
</P>
<P>
   On another part of Georgica Pond he demolished much of the
natural woods to put in a pool, complete with a carved rosewood
Indian pavilion, for a Wall Street broker and his wife. Then his
crew spent three years turning five acres of scrub oak into a
woodland park, full of exotic plants, grassy paths and a quiet
pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been mulling over what to do with their house,''
Seeler said, nodding toward the simple wood summer house, built in
1900. ``So I suggested they start with the pool and the gardens and
sort of work backward.'' They got the gardening bug, he said, and
``realized they didn't need a great room and all those things
people think they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the couple has moved to England and put the property up for
sale. ``For $10.2 million,'' Seeler said. ``That shocks me.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's my dream. That the new owner wants a scrub oak woods full
of bayberry, cedar and blueberry. That Seeler haul all those blue
hydrangeas, and the Indian pavilion back to Bayberry Nursery.

FORD TO OFFER NEW SYSTEMS ON SPORT VEHICLES
</HEADLINE>
  (With TIRE-RECALL) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. _ The Ford Motor Co. announced on Wednesday
that it would offer computerized stability systems on its sport
utility vehicles and pickups by the 2005 model year, to improve the
handling of the tall vehicles and reduce the frequency of
rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   But the systems will be optional on many of the models, meaning
that customers who want them will have to pay extra. Ford currently
charges $725 for the option on its $33,000 Lincoln LS sports sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The expensive suspension systems, which automatically apply the
brakes slightly to one or more wheels to prevent them from
slipping, are currently available only on a few luxury models, like
the Lincoln LS sedan and the Mercedes ML320 sport utility vehicle.
But safety experts have been calling for automakers to make them
more available.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Inglis, Ford's vice president for North American
automotive operations, said the move was independent of the recall
by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. of 6.5 million tires, many of them on
Ford Explorer sport utilities. Inglis announced the plan at the
auto industry's annual summer meeting, organized by the University
of Michigan and held in northwestern Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors responded by saying that the Cadillac Escalade
full-sized sport utility vehicle would be equipped with the
stability system as standard equipment starting this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Stability systems allow even fairly tall, heavy vehicles to be
driven with agility around obstacles that can cause crashes, like
debris in the road, other vehicles, animals or pedestrians.
Continental A.G., a big German manufacturer of tires and brakes,
recently hosted a demonstration of the technology in the suburbs of
Detroit. When reporters drove the Mercedes sport utility through a
slalom course of cones designed to simulate a swerve around an
obstacle in the road, the sport utility tipped up on two wheels
when going a little more than 30 miles an hour with the stability
system disengaged. But when the system was engaged, all four wheels
stayed on the ground.

GORE CLARIFIES RELATIONSHIP WITH VP CHOICE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tenn. _ Democratic presidential contender Al Gore made
it clear Wednesday that while he welcomed running mate Joe
Lieberman's differing opinions on a number of issues, Gore's
position would prevail in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore clarified his relationship with his new vice-presidential
pick as the two appeared in the vice president's home town of
Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   With Lieberman and his family by his side, Gore listened to
friends and constituents talk about the boy or young man they knew
who eventually grew up to be a representative, senator, vice
president and now Democratic presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd praised Gore for his constituent service over
the years. But one woman, who identified herself as a member of a
teachers' union, raised the touchy issue of Lieberman's support of
private school vouchers, one of several areas of dispute between
the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a Connecticut senator, defended his support for a
pilot program, arguing he wanted to help students in poor public
urban schools with no hope of reform. But both he and the
presidential candidate made it clear that Gore's position would
prevail in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Although they might disagree privately, Lieberman said,
``Believe me when President Gore decides, vice president Lieberman
will support him wholeheartedly.``
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping his arm around his running mate Gore quickly chimed in,
``I am not afraid to have a vice president who disagrees with me on
some things.'' But he added, ``Our administration will be opposed
to private school vouchers.``
</P>
<P>
   Later Gore also addressed the issue of abortion, where there is
a shade of differences between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   While both men support abortion rights, Lieberman has also
backed parental consent for minors to get abortions. Gore told
reporters on Air Force 2 that he was willing to look at proposals
for parental notification for minors seeking an abortion _ a less
restrictive provision.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore quickly added that he had not seen notification
proposals that would still protect women's rights to chose to have
an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to support anything that becomes an attack on a
woman's right to chose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman played down any differences over abortion.
``Our views are not all that different,'' Gore said. Lieberman
concurred, ``Our positions are quite comparable there.``
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning in California, Republican presidential
candidate and Texas Gov. George W. Bush offered faint praise of
Gore's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pick,'' Bush said, adding that Lieberman has won
bipartisan support during his career and is ``a man of integrity. I
appreciate his views on Social Security,'' which some analysts have
described as more like Bush's than Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Bush disputed suggestions that by picking a harsh critic of
President Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair, Gore had
inoculated himself against claims that he would carry Clinton's
moral legacy into the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are going to decide who best can bring a
new tone to Washington. If Vice President Gore says `I'm different
from President Clinton,' let him explain how. I'm saying I am,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Embarking on his ninth California visit this year, Bush and
Texas First Lady Laura Bush boarded a special train that delivered
them to spirited train-station rallies in Oxnard and San Luis
Obispo. His running mate, Dick Cheney, was campaigning in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   While in Carthage, Gore listened to friends and constituents
talk about the boy or young man they knew who eventually grew up to
be a representative, senator, vice president and now Democratic
presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every important thing in my life started in Carthage,'' Gore
said, addressing a crowd in the local school gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd praised Gore for his constituent service over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Others offered fond stories about how Gore helped them.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Thompson, editor of the Winchester Herald Chronicle,
recalled how as a 14 year old in 1989 he delivered a note from his
mother to Gore at one of his town hall meetings asking the then
senator to help his grandmother get her Social Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson produced a letter that had been written by Gore
informing the family that the retirement checks, including back
unpaid benefits would soon be arriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got that letter I knew why we were Democrats,'' he
said. Another woman told Gore, ``I'm so proud of you. Don't let the
bad publicity that surrounds you get you down.``
</P>
<P>
   The day began with a visit by the two families to the Gore
family farm and across the street to the house where Gore's mother
Pauline now lives.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with a visit by the candidates to the home of
Lieberman's mother, Marcia, in Stamford, Conn., where the new vice
presidential candidate grew up before heading to Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a former attorney general and two term senator from
Connecticut, was greeted enthusiastically at an evening rally at
the Stamford Italian Center.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke proudly of his roots in the town where his father owned
a liquor store. He joked that his late father was having a
conversation with his late uncle in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``My uncle Ben is saying ''Do you believe this _ all the way
from Hawthorne Street,`` referring to the street where Lieberman
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   The day was devoted to stressing the theme that while both men
on the Democratic ticket have spent many years in Washington they
are still rooted in mainstream America.
</P>
<P>
   However, some Tennessee critics have questioned Gore's ties to
the state. While both of his parents were born in Tennessee, Gore
was born in Washington D.C. and went to an exclusive private school
in the nation's capital while his father served as senator.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore spent every summer working on the family farm in
Carthage, a small town in the rolling hills about an hour east of
Nashville. &QL;

AMPLE ROOM FOR PLAY, AND EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A child's room is a stage where children squawk like
parrots, transform themselves into Hansel and Gretel or paint,
fresh from their imaginations, a picture of a red tree on a cobalt
blue ground. The more visible the toys, the easier it is for a
child to play.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Mark and Nancy Zvonkovic asked Robin Elmslie Osler, a
Manhattan architect, to turn two maids' rooms into a bedroom-study
for their daughter Andie, then 2. Their request was basic: a bed,
built-in desk, and lots of shelves and drawers, Osler said.
</P>
<P>
   Andie most likes the lidded opening behind the headboard, which
is 14 inches deep and 24 inches wide. She transformed the space
into a theater for one. ``She would draw scenery on a piece of
paper,'' Osler said, ``hang it on top of the lid of the opening,
and do puppet shows in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Improv space is also what Liz Stern, the mother of two girls, 2
and 3, wanted when she recently asked Marco Pasanella, a Manhattan
designer, to create a playroom in their Upper West Side apartment.
She asked for what she called stations for children's play,
reminiscent of a kindergarten class, with plastic bins full of toys
on shelves, but more delightful. ``Children can see where the toys
are, take them out of the bin, and clean up after themselves,''
said Stern, who has taught kindergarten and nursery school and is
now a full-time mother and the wife of Emanuel Stern, president of
Hartz Mountain Industries, which owns the TriBeCa Grand and SoHo
Grand hotels in Manhattan. What is visible will be played with;
what is invisible will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be an art station with table and chairs and all the
supplies at their own level,'' Stern said. ``There will be a
computer station and a television station. There will be a cozy,
nooky kind of area and a dress-up area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want a lot of color, because the color comes out of
their own artwork. If you design a room that is too
representational or too colorful, it becomes stifling to the
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The room will have pale yellow or green walls and a wood floor
warmed by a cotton rug _ but it won't be empty. Pasanella will make
the 12-by-17-foot room as conducive to daydreaming as to building a
toy kingdom ruled by co-princesses. The intention is that the room
will be functional, not fanciful. ``It's condescending to make
everything look like Romper Room, meaning that everything is a
caricature, and colors are exaggerated,'' Pasanella said.
</P>
<P>
   The playroom, which will be built this fall, will provide
instant gratification. The children will be able to draw, paint and
display their art all in one space. A 4-foot-wide roll of kraft
paper will hang permanently on the wall. Not only will the children
be able to paint on the paper upright, but their mother imagines a
day when they will also paint with their feet. ``They can put it on
the floor, stick their feet in paint and walk on the paper,'' Stern
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pasanella has designed two display areas for artwork. Two large
linen-covered Homasote boards will be mounted on the wall, on
either side of the roll of paper. The bottom third of the wall is
markerboard, or porcelain on steel, so washable markers can be
wiped clean and magnets can affix art and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The design calls for a row of pegs mounted just above the
markerboard, so the children can hang up their dresses, hats and
scarves after playing dress-up. Stern nurtures the faint hope that
if there are lots of bins and hooks and cubbies, the girls will
clean up after themselves. ``We'll see,'' Pasanella said.
</P>
<P>
   For daydreaming, moon-gazing or cuddling, the design specifies
low window seats with open storage underneath. Along with curtains,
Pasanella has called for a pull-down canvas shade, which the
children will be encouraged to paint.
</P>
<P>
   Since children like to be on the floor, the television will be
placed in the fireplace, set on andirons that have been rubberized
for safety. The mirror above the fireplace tilts down, so the
children can look up and see themselves. The fourth wall will
contain shallow shelves to hold the books, games, stuffed animals,
paints, crayons and puzzles that make up a child's world.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture? Very little. A table with bins, and a bed on casters
for sleepovers. Mostly there will be floor space. Plenty of room
for a child's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   To make a playroom enticing, Marco Pasanella, a Manhattan
interior designer, provided, among other things, lots of art
supplies and display areas. He also paid attention to safety,
coating a set of andirons with rubber before turning them into a
television stand in an unused fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Boards for Drawing and Display: The bottom third of one wall is
unframed porcelain-over-steel markerboard. Pasanella pointed out
that the panels must be professionally installed because the edges
are razor sharp and must be covered. (Melamine, a synthetic resin,
can also be used, framed or unframed, though it may discolor over
time.) A 4-by-8-foot panel of markerboard is $471; the same size in
melamine is $104. Both from Demco, (800) 356-1200.
</P>
<P>

EDUCATIONAL COMPANY SAYS TEST SCORES ROSE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Performance on standardized tests by students attending Edison
Schools, the country's largest for-profit manager of public
schools, improved at a faster rate last year than in the previous
four years, even as the company enrolled more poor and minority
students.
</P>
<P>
   The gains mirror a national trend of rising test scores, but
Edison's results provide the company with a rebuttal to critics who
have asserted that profit-seeking school managers like Edison might
be able to increase test scores initially but would be unable to
sustain those trends.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to be released Thursday, Edison says that in the
1999-2000 academic year, the percentage of students in 40
Edison-run schools in 14 states meeting those states' achievement
standards rose to 36 percent, from 29 percent. In the previous four
years, Edison students had achieved average annual gains of six
percentage points on state tests, most of which measure performance
against an absolute state standard.
</P>
<P>
   On national tests, which generally measure students' relative
performance against a norm, Edison students performed at the 39th
percentile, up from the 34th percentile in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   While Edison's statistics provide a reliable picture of
performance of those schools, it is difficult to compare those
results to national achievement standards because the scores are
drawn from many different tests in schools in dozens of states.
Some of those tests track students from one year to the next, while
others measure the performance of students in a given grade each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the steady improvements have come as Edison has enrolled
growing numbers of minority and poor students, the result of a
national trend of school districts seeking private management for
their worst-performing schools. Last year, African-Americans
accounted for 55 percent of Edison's 37,500 students, up from 46
percent the previous year, while white students dropped to 18
percent of the total from 27 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 65 percent of Edison's students qualified last year
for free or reduced-price lunches, a generally recognized poverty
indicator, up from 57 percent the previous year. Nationally, about
33 percent of students qualify for the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Edison's performance claims are likely to be closely scrutinized
in New York City, where Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has
announced a plan to turn some of the city's worst-performing
schools over to private managers start in the fall of 2001. Edison
intends to offer a proposal to manage several of the schools, said
Christopher Whittle, Edison's founder and chief executive.

U.S. COURT RULING TO HASTEN INTRODUCTION OF GENERIC FORM OF
PROZAC 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court ruling Wednesday cleared the
way for the sale of a generic version of Prozac, the world's
top-selling antidepressant, as early as next summer, about two
years earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly, the maker of Prozac, said it would appeal the ruling,
but the company's stock plunged 29 percent Wednesday to $76.875 as
investors digested the news. Lilly sold $2.6 billion of Prozac last
year, and the drug now makes up about 26 percent of Lilly's
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was good news for the 38 million people around the
world who have taken Prozac. The generic version could be priced at
less than one-third of the current price of the drug. A 30-day
supply of Prozac now costs about $90 at a Duane Reade pharmacy in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price of Barr Laboratories, the drugmaker that will
sell the first generic version of Prozac, rose Wednesday by 66
percent to $76.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce L. Downey, Barr's chairman and chief executive, predicted
that the ruling would cause more generic drug companies to bring
court challenges to the numerous patents that brand name drugmakers
file to try to keep cheaper, generic versions of their drugs off
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to extend the monopoly on a popular brand-name drug are
common in the pharmaceutical industry and critical to companies'
profitability. A patent gives a drug company the right to be the
sole seller of a given drug for 20 years from the date the patent
application is filed. But often the companies file numerous patent
applications on different aspects of the same drug _ different uses
of the drug, for example, or slightly different formulations _ to
try to get even more years of exclusive sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt strongly that what they had a patent on was not
patentable,'' Downey said. ``We kept the faith because we felt so
strongly about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr first filed its patent challenge in April 1996. The company
argued, in part, that Lilly held two patents on the same drug. Barr
contended that one of Lilly's patents on Prozac, which expires in
2003, was a ``double patent'' and was not valid.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-trial hearing in January 1999, Judge Sarah Barker of
the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis dismissed that claim. But
before the trial started, both Barr and Lilly agreed to take the
case directly to the appeals court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the appeals court reversed Barker's decision. But the
court upheld a second decision by Barker that Lilly's patent
expiring in August 2001 was valid. As a result, Barr can sell
generic Prozac as early as next August.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Wednesday, Lilly executives said that they
expect sales of Prozac to fall quickly in the second half of next
year as people begin to buy the generic version.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the outcome we had hoped for,'' said Sidney
Taurel, chairman and chief executive of Eli Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   Taurel said that the company would appeal the decision, either
to the federal Appeals Court that ruled Wednesday or to the Supreme
Court. But he said that the company also had ``a contingency plan''
in place in case the appeal failed. That plan includes getting
regulatory approval for two different versions of Prozac, both of
which are patented: a once-a-week Prozac and a new version of
Prozac, which is now being developed by Sepracor, a drug company
based in Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly also plans to begin selling Sarafem this month. Sarafem is
the same drug as Prozac, but it will be marketed to women as a
treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or severe
premenstrual symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Taurel also said that other other new drugs now in development _
including Zovant, a drug to treat blood infections, and Forteo, a a
treatment for osteoporosis _ will help offset any reduction in
sales of Prozac. By late 2002, Lilly executives expect revenue to
begin increasing again by 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, Lilly's stock priced soared when research showed
that Zovant was found to reduce deaths from septic infections.
</P>
<P>
   Based on its stock price compared to its earnings, Lilly was the
most expensive stock in the industry before Wednesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was completely unexpected,'' said Sergio Traversa, an
analyst who covers drug stocks for ING Barings. He said that
investors had been bidding up Lilly's stock because of the strong
products in its development pipeline. Traversa said analysts had
expected that Lilly would have time to get r-fluoxetine, the
version of Prozac being developed by Sepracor, on the market before
its Prozac patent expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lilly will appeal,'' Traversa said, ``but they do not appear
to be confident that they will be able to reverse the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling also caused the share prices of the makers of
other antidepressives to fall. The stock of Forest Laboratories,
the maker of Celexa, fell by 24 percent to $89.50. Pfizer, the
maker of Zoloft, fell $2.171875 to $42.75.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor's share price also plunged, falling $23.375 to
$106.125.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly's shares fell $31.671875 to $76.875.

FARTHER EVEN THAN MONTAUK: A CABIN IN THE ANDES SKY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN P. WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friends are envious when they hear that my wife, Rynn, and I
have built a family retreat in the Ecuadorian Andes, with two
mature orange trees in the yard and flocks of parrots flying by.
</P>
<P>
   The house is situated in an ``un-Provence'' called Zona de
Intag, a rural county that tends more toward fried yucca than white
truffle omelets. We call it a weekend house because it takes three
days to travel there by plane, bus, horse and foot from New York.
The final leg is a muddy path that meanders past sugar cane fields
and clusters of orchids until it reaches our house, where we live
in 19th-century style, without electricity or plumbing other than a
spring-fed garden hose connected to a sink.
</P>
<P>
   ``When can we expect you?'' we ask friends. Suddenly their Palm
Pilot calendars are full.
</P>
<P>
   This two-bedroom paradise sits about 6,000 feet up at the edge
of a private cloud-forest reserve several hours' drive northwest of
Otavalo, a small town on the Pan-American Highway that's famous for
its Indian market. Cloud forests are basically high-altitude rain
forests, and this one has more variety of plant life per acre than
the Amazon basin.
</P>
<P>
   Rynn, who is a poet, and I decided to build here five years
after first visiting the 1,235-acre reserve, called La Florida, in
1993. During our visit, Rynn stumbled across a decrepit
board-and-batten house at the edge of the woods, with orchids
growing from the roof tiles and faded murals of volcanoes on the
exterior walls. We later rented the house for $75 a month. It was
so isolated that days could pass without anyone walking by on the
trail. We adapted well, hauling supplies on horseback, raising food
and reading by candlelight. We stayed for nine months, returning to
New York when Rynn became pregnant with our first daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, we've visited the area many times, staying in a
cabin at La Florida which is owned by Carlos Zorrilla, a Cuban
expatriate, and Sandy Statz, his wife, who grew up on a Wisconsin
dairy farm. Three years ago we tried, and failed, to persuade our
old landlord to sell us the board-and-batten house. So we asked
Zorrilla and Statz if we could build a new one on a particularly
beautiful parcel they owned, high above a tumbling river. The
terms: We would pay for the construction and use it twice a year
for month-long family vacations; they would supply the land and
look after the place, and earn money by renting it out to the
scientists and students who sometimes visit the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Zorrilla is a founder of a local grass-roots group that
successfully persuaded Mitsubishi to cancel a huge copper mine that
could have ruined the area. Right now they are battling the World
Bank on other mining projects and helping locals establish organic
coffee farms.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the environmental pressures facing the area, Zorrilla
urged us to build the house using as many sustainable materials as
possible. So we chose the most renewable resource available: mud,
packed onto lath and coated with plaster, in a local method called
barreque. We began by drawing a simple layout, and the plans never
progressed far beyond that initial scribble.
</P>
<P>
   At our first meeting, Elias Imbaquingo, a respected local
builder, calculated our expenses, including the cost of hauling
3,000 clay roof tiles down from the road on horseback, at 40 tiles
per horse. The tiles would arrive at the trail head on a truck from
Otavalo, as would the windows and eucalyptus floor planks.
</P>
<P>
   For the support beams, Imbaquingo felled alder and cypress that
Zorrilla had planted years before. I doubt that any North American
builder would attempt to fabricate a house today using just
handpowered tools and muscle, as Imbaquingo did. He even built his
ladder on site. When he found a bent nail on the ground, he'd pound
it straight and stick it in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Since he lived an hour away over steep mountain trails,
Imbaquingo and his three-man crew brought their own cook _ usually
Mrs. Imbaquingo, a baby in a sling on her back _ to prepare hot
meals. They often stayed for days at a time, sleeping in a vacant
house nearby, and sometimes they'd disappear for several weeks, in
the universal contractors' tradition. After about nine months,
Imbaquingo called the local men together for a minga, which is a
communal work-and-party tradition that dates from Inca times.
Thirty-seven men showed up, and a few woman carrying pots of corn,
fried pork, rice and vegetable soup. Bottles of the fiery local rum
called trago made the rounds, along with vodka, beer, wine and a
mild Andean brew called chicha, made from wheat and raw sugar and
spiked with spit to get the fermentation going. The men mixed horse
manure with fresh dirt to give it grip and tossed the gooey lumps
onto the lath. After a skim coat of plaster, Imbaquingo painted the
walls white.
</P>
<P>
   Then he arranged the roof tiles, dug the outhouse and set up the
solar-heated shower. The living-dining room soars up about 16 feet
to the roof. The bedrooms have woven grass ceilings. Since it
rarely goes below 60 degrees, most of our days are spent on the
large porch.
</P>
<P>
   Rynn and I visited three times during the two-year construction
process, trusting the details to Zorrilla. The house, roughly 900
square feet, was completed this spring and cost $5,000. Beds,
tables and hammocks, some made locally from knotty guava wood, cost
an additional $500.
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   This spring, my daughter Bolivia, now 4, and I traveled to see
our new house. Rynn was pregnant and chose to stay at home with our
other daughter, Violet, who had a bad case of the terrible 2s.
</P>
<P>
   I was astonished at how comfortable the house felt, with its
high ceilings and expansive porch. The days passed with walks,
games and expeditions to gather oranges, bananas and strawberries
from Zorrilla's gardens. The only machines we ever heard were
old-time farm tools, like the gas-powered presses used to extract
sugar cane juice, which we drank warm, mixed with juice from
fresh-picked lemons the size of softballs. Since our trip was too
short to haul in cooking supplies, we ate with the Zorrilla family.
Once again we were part of a culture in which people killed what
little meat they ate (Bolivia enjoyed seeing the chicken head in
her bowl of soup), wore clothes for protection rather than fashion,
and worked for subsistence, not status.
</P>
<P>
   During each visit to the area I learn more, and become more
rooted. I have a godson there, named after me, and many close
friends who sometimes laugh at my ignorance of the world _ their
world. At La Florida, some trees bleed red sap, and the equatorial
night skies offer constellations from both hemispheres. Each
evening after we looked at the stars I would read ``Madeline''
aloud on the porch before Bolivia went to bed to the sounds of
crickets and frogs. Though it was late May, and almost the end of
the nine-month rainy season, heavy showers fell most days. Toward
the end of our stay, the rain loosened landslides that closed the
only two roads out of La Florida, leaving us stranded. This had
never happened during previous visits.
</P>
<P>
   Zorrilla had recently run a phone line to his solar-powered
computer. But the rain knocked the service out. I'd never felt so
isolated, or so peaceful. I plopped into a hammock while Bolivia
picked grass to feed chickens. Friends say they'd be afraid to be
so far from doctors _ the nearest good hospital is five hours away
and there's no such thing as MediVac. If you fell and broke your
back while trying to locate the outhouse in the dark you would have
to be carried on horseback to the ancient Land Rover that Zorrilla
keeps near the road.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable or not, Rynn and I have chosen not to dwell on the
potential for disaster, just as we don't obsess over the infectious
deer ticks at our summer home on Shelter Island, or the deadly
mosquitoes buzzing around Manhattan. That's not to suggest we
aren't prudent, especially when it comes to our kids (future visits
will include our son, Beckett, who was born three weeks ago). We
carry medicine and reassure ourselves that Zorrilla and Statz have
raised two healthy boys, 9 and 11, by relying on good sense and
their collection of antibiotics and medical guidebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this easy-going philosophy was severely tested the day
the roads finally opened and I hired a truck to take me and Bolivia
up the mountains toward the 21st century and home. At about 10,000
feet, a fresh mudslide blocked the road. I chose to carry Bolivia
across the 70-yard-wide slide to a bus rather than spend the night
in the truck with no food or water. About 20 yards in, I sank to my
thighs in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   To move, I had to set Bolivia on top of the mud in front of me,
and then struggle to free my legs enough to step toward her. Around
me, people were stuck and yelling for help.
</P>
<P>
   To the left, a cliff dropped sharply away from where the road
had been. I heard water trickling, and realized the slide was
unstable. A young woman screamed: ``It's happening again! It's
coming!''
</P>
<P>
   Adrenaline made me charge to solid ground, Bolivia crying in my
arms. We boarded the bus and soon we were headed to a dry hotel. I
was so frightened that I doubted I would ever take my children
there again.
</P>
<P>
   But my terror has faded with the passing days, and Bolivia has
shown no signs of distress. This week she asked hopefully when we
would return to the house in the forest so she could swing on the
hammocks.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Rynn and I would have replied, ``We'll see.'' But
this time we told her we might travel there for an old-fashioned
Christmas. Rynn and I can't decide whether our vacation home is the
source of our tranquillity or an emblem of our insanity. Perhaps
it's both.

NO INCREASE SEEN IN CHILD ABUSE AFTER WELFARE CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ala., Calif., Colo., Fla., Mass., Mich., Minn., N.J.,
N.Y., Texas, Wash., Wis.)   By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Congress abolished welfare as a permanent safety net four
years ago, there were alarming predictions about the prospect of an
already overwhelmed foster care system's being flooded by a new
wave of abused children. But according to the early findings of two
studies, the changes do not appear to have had such dire effects
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmed cases of child abuse and neglect have fallen since
1996, the researchers involved in the studies say. Their
conclusions are confirmed by federal statistics released Wednesday
reporting that there were 903,000 cases of child maltreatment in
1998, compared with 969,000 in 1996 and 1,019,000 in the peak year
of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   One study notes, too, that while data is limited, the number of
children entering foster care has been stable or falling slightly
in recent years, continuing the national decline that began
slightly more than five years ago, after the worst period of crack
cocaine addiction. In 1999, 3.3 children out of every 1,000 entered
foster care, according to one study, down from 3.87 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no other forecast to stem from the 1996 welfare overhaul
was as chilling as the predictions regarding foster care. At the
time, some advocates for the poor and child welfare officials
feared that the stress of losing benefits or the pressures of
having to work for a welfare check would lead to a rise in child
abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest findings suggest that since President Clinton
signed the 1996 legislation placing strict time limits and work
obligations on much of the country's welfare recipients, their
children do not seem to have flooded into foster care.
</P>
<P>
   That somewhat heartening picture comes at a time when children's
overall well-being has improved slightly. Child poverty, infant
mortality and birth rates for teen-agers have declined noticeably
in the 1990s, a study released last month by the Federal
Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the picture is entirely rosy, but there is
little evidence, if any, to suggest that there's a large population
negatively affected,'' said Rob Geen, a senior research associate
with the Urban Institute, a research organization based in
Washington that is conducting a far-reaching study of the impact of
the welfare changes.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and policy analysts caution, however, that certain
states and certain families show signs of trouble that deserve
closer attention. There are, after all, many much less blunt ways
of measuring possible damage to children other than foster care
admissions _ from health conditions to juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerns come in when you speak to individual workers and
hear stories about specific families that have been affected by
welfare reform,'' Geen said. ``There are many of them, but they are
not large enough or well documented enough to show up in the
aggregate numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The full and lasting impact of welfare changes on children and
family well-being will most likely play out over the next several
years, because different states are on different schedules for
putting the law's changes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Some states imposed work requirements or time limits on welfare
recipients before the 1996 federal laws took effect. In other
states, time limits have not kicked in. Officials with the Urban
Institute, as well as those with the Chapin Hall Center for
Children at the University of Chicago, who have conducted a study
of welfare families in Illinois, consequently warn that the
snapshot they have so far developed is an early one.
</P>
<P>
   For now, even if the most dire predictions do not appear to have
been realized, how much of that can be attributed to the success of
an overhaul of welfare remains imprecise. Other trends _ chiefly,
the general economic health of the country, declining rates of
child poverty, and unrelated changes in child welfare policies _
could also be responsible. Nor is it clear what would have happened
to foster care caseloads in the absence of changes in welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Some children, the researchers contend, may be getting by
without welfare because their parents have found work. Some
children who are in fact being neglected may now not show up on the
radar of child welfare workers because their families are no longer
on government assistance. Other at-risk families may be temporarily
shielded by relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   In raising concerns that foster care systems would be burdened
by an influx of vulnerable children, advocates noted that poverty
is the greatest single ingredient in the mistreatment or neglect of
children. Many experts wondered, then, whether under a welfare
overhaul more children would land in foster care and whether more
of them would languish there for longer because judges might be
reluctant to return children to homes with empty pantries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly everyone we spoke with expected to see significant
negative effects from welfare reform on child welfare,'' Geen said.
``There's no evidence to suggest that there has been a substantial
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, however, that there is scattered evidence of trouble
that merits close examination. In some states, like Michigan, child
neglect reports based on lack of supervision have spiked sharply.
Geen said state child welfare workers told him they believed that
the increase reflected, in part, new welfare-to-work requirements,
with mothers now having to leave their children unattended. But the
increase, Geen said, could be due to other changes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Geen's report is based on aggregate data and interviews with 500
policy &UR; - &LR; makers, welfare office workers, child welfare caseworkers,
advocates and other experts in 12 states: Alabama, California,
Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey,
New York, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   State by state figures will not be released until Geen's report
is published later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, New Jersey, Texas and Washington, the number of
child abuse and neglect investigations increased significantly from
1996 through 1998, the most recent year for which figures are
available. Geen said state officials attributed those increases not
to welfare reform, but to other factors in child welfare policies,
like changes in screening policies. He said the number of
substantiated cases declined in all but one of the 12 states in
that same period.
</P>
<P>
   In more than half of the 12, welfare workers filed more child
neglect reports than in the past. But case workers who investigate
those reports noted that many of the referrals were inappropriate,
Geen said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Chapin Hall study similarly concluded that child
welfare indicators had not taken a turn for the worse since the
welfare law changed. Neither abuse and neglect reports, nor the
number of children coming into foster care, has gone up in Illinois
since 1996, it found.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not entirely due to the success of welfare reform,''
said Robert Goerge, associate director of Chapin Hall. ``We have a
very strong economy and that generally results in fewer reports of
abuse and neglect and fewer children going into foster care.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Illinois embarked on a major overhaul of its
child welfare system, seeking to get more children into permanent
homes and trying to prevent children from coming into the formal
foster care system.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the difficulty of understanding the impact of
welfare policy changes on children's lives. The ebb and flow of
foster care numbers is driven by everything from widely publicized
incidents of child fatalities, like the Elisa Izquierdo case in New
York City, which significantly drove up abuse reports, to crack
cocaine addiction, which drove up foster care numbers to record
levels in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't have full information on whether requiring
parents to go to work and threatening to cut off their aid actually
improves the welfare of their children or prevents abuse and
neglect,'' Goerge said. ``But it is certainly the case that welfare
reform hasn't made things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of families on welfare has dropped by 50 percent
since 1993, to 2,453,000 in September 1999, according to figures
released recently by the federal Department of Health and Human
Services. So far, many single mothers on welfare have found jobs
and have seen some increase in their income, according to a study
by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research
organization in Washington. But since the new welfare laws took
effect, the incomes of 1.8 million families have declined, to
$8,400 a year on average, compared with $8,760 in 1995. The center
has not specifically inquired what has happened to their children.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal data, in New York state the welfare
caseload has shrunk by one third since 1993, to 279,692 families in
September 1999, most of them in New York City. Of those who have
left the rolls, city officials cannot say how many have found work.
Nor is much known about the general well-being of their families,
including their encounters with the city's child welfare agency.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are left on the rolls, some social policy analysts
say, may be the ones who are the most ill-prepared to make it on
their own. They may be impeded by mental illness or substance
abuse, or they may be victims of domestic violence _ the same
conditions that may also place their children at greater risk of
abuse and neglect. Their prospects may not be discerned until a
year or two from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know the answers now,'' Geen said. ``But
everyone we spoke to said, `Please come back in two years and we'll
have a different story to tell you.'''

U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE PLAN COULD PROVOKE CHINA, INTELLIGENCE REPORT
WARNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A highly classified intelligence report warns that
deploying an American national missile defense could prompt China
to expand its nuclear arsenal tenfold and lead Russia to place
multiple warheads on ballistic missiles that now carry only one,
according to officials who have reviewed it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report reaffirms what China and Russia have
publicly said in opposition to the system, it offers a detailed
analysis of how those two nations are likely to respond and
suggests that the effects of an American decision to build a
nuclear defense would ripple around the globe from Europe to South
Asia, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It warns that China would expand its relatively small arsenal of
roughly 20 long-range nuclear missiles to a quantity large enough
to overwhelm the limited defensive system that the Clinton
administration is considering. One person who has seen the report
said it estimated that China could deploy up to 200 warheads by
2015, prompting India and Pakistan to respond with their own
buildups.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia's economy is unlikely to support a large buildup
of its missile forces, officials said the report found that it
could again deploy shorter-range missiles along its borders and
resume adding multiple warheads to its ballistic missiles. That is
something Russia agreed to stop as part of the second strategic
arms control treaty, or Start 2, which it ratified this year.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Foreign Responses to U.S. National Missile Defense
Deployment,'' underscores warnings by opponents here and abroad
that the administration's proposal to build a limited defensive
system could lead to a new arms race with Russia and, to a lesser
extent, in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not recommend for or against a national missile
defense, but simply spells out potential consequences. Although it
makes clear that some of those consequences could be dire, the
study also underscores the emerging threat to the United States
from the proliferation of ballistic missiles, which advocates have
long cited as the rationale for building a system.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who received a copy in the last few days, has
said he would make a decision on whether to go ahead with the
system this year based on four criteria, including two covered by
the report, the threat to and the effects on overall national
security, including arms control. The other criteria are the cost
and the technological feasibility.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Defense Secretary William Cohen said he would delay
until at least next month making a recommendation to the president
on the system. He cited ``a number of difficult issues'' that have
to be resolved. The secretary, who has been briefed on the
intelligence findings, is supposed to base his recommendation in
part on the effects addressed in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is expected to be sent to members of Congress
on Thursday, is sure to fuel the debate over whether Clinton should
approve the first steps toward a defensive shield or postpone the
decision until the next administration. An official who has seen
the report said it included assessments that critics and supporters
of a missile defense would use ``and make no one happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And it could affect the presidential campaign. Vice President Al
Gore has largely embraced the administration stand of building a
limited land-based system. The Republican candidate, George W.
Bush, favors a broader system that could include sea- and
space-based arms.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes an annex that repeats the intelligence
assessment last year that Iraq, Iran and North Korea could develop
ballistic missiles capable of hitting the United States by 2015,
the officials said. In fact, the threat from North Korea may be
more imminent, despite a flurry of diplomatic activity by North
Korea, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although North Korea has abided by a pledge that it made last
year not to test its long-range missiles, it has continued building
a three-stage missile that could hit the United States and could
deploy it ``in reasonably short order,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, a National Intelligence Estimate, represents the
collective assessment of the nation's intelligence agencies,
including the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State
Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research. One senior official
said the report did not intend to predict with certainty how China,
Russia and other countries would respond, but rather simply laid
out a range of responses.
</P>
<P>
   Another official, arguing that the report did not necessarily
undercut the case for a missile defense, said some of the findings
represented worst-case scenarios. The report says, for example,
that the Russians could withdraw from ``an array of arms control
treaties,'' especially if the United States went ahead without
negotiating changes in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972,
which prohibits national missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The official noted that although Russia had so far strongly
resisted Washington's efforts to change the treaty, they have an
interest in negotiating reductions in both countries' nuclear
arsenals, because Russia can scarcely afford to maintain the 5,000
or so warheads that it has.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggests that the Russians could accept a trade-off
that would strictly limit the American defensive system to 100
interceptor missiles based in Alaska, as the administration has
proposed building by 2007. But without an agreement, Russia could
respond by increasing the warheads on each missile.

MARKETPLACE: NO. 2 AT JANUS LEAVING MUTUAL FUND COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When executives of the phenomenally successful Janus
family of mutual funds started feuding publicly with the management
of their parent company last year, some investors feared the
dispute would drive out top talent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jim Craig, the No. 2 executive at Janus, said he
would leave but insisted that his resignation was unrelated to the
feud.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who played a crucial role in building the Janus Capital
Corp. from a small money-management operation in Denver into the
fifth-biggest mutual fund company in the country, said he had
resigned to manage money for a charitable foundation that his wife
would run. Since he turned over the reins of the flagship Janus
Fund at the end of 1999, Craig, 44, had been overseeing the
company's funds as chief investment officer.
</P>
<P>
   He and other Janus officials repeatedly said on Wednesday that
his leaving should not affect management of the $308 billion in
Janus' 23 mutual funds and its institutional and private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very confident there will be nary a ripple in the
operations at Janus,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently were less certain as shares of Stilwell
Financial Inc. $3.50, to $44.50. That was the biggest one-day drop
since Stilwell was formed a month ago when Kansas City Southern
Industries, the railroad company in Kansas City, Mo., spun off
Janus with three other subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Bailey, the founder and chief executive of Janus, and
other Janus managers had pressed the railroad to spin off Janus
separately. But the railroad executives rejected that idea in a
bitter battle that, at one point, led them to spell out in
financial documents how they thought they could fire Bailey. For
the most part, Craig stayed out of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing at all to do with Stilwell,'' he said in an
interview. ``That's kind of a sideshow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who sold most of Janus to Kansas City Southern in 1984,
remains entrenched at Janus, and a company spokeswoman said he had
no plans to leave. Craig, who was Bailey's designated successor as
chief executive, said he did not expect the company to name anybody
to take his place.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would sell his stock in Janus, which is not publicly
traded, back to the company. He declined to say how much he owned,
but one analyst estimated his stake at about 1 percent. Stilwell
owns 80 percent of Janus, Bailey owns about 12 percent and other
Janus employees own the rest.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Stilwell said the parent company had the
``utmost confidence in Tom Bailey'' and the rest of the Janus
management team. ``We believe Janus has appropriate management in
place to continue to produce returns for the shareholders of the
Janus family of funds,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said he did
not take Craig's resignation as a sign of continuing management
turmoil at Stilwell. He continues to recommend that investors buy
the stock, whose price he said has been depressed by concerns about
Janus' concentration on aggressive growth stocks and the
``animosity and tension between Janus and the parent company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a huge event,'' Moszkowski said. ``If Jim Craig were
departing to start his own money management shop and potentially
taking a lot of the talent and a lot of the assets with him, you'd
have a real cause for worry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jon Zeschin, a former fund company executive who is a
consultant in Denver, said there was no way to separate Craig's
decision from the hostility created by the infighting over the
spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to believe that there certainly are some issues
there,'' Zeschin said. ``It seems rather abrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeschin said he would have expected the managers of Janus and
Stilwell to plan a more gradual transition that would not come as
such a surprise to shareholders. The suddenness of the departure,
coming when the performance of Janus funds has cooled considerably,
inevitably will lead people to wonder, ``Is Jim Craig getting out
now because things aren't going so well?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Nasdaq stock market plummeted in April, Janus funds
had been shocking the industry with their performance. Investors
took notice and flooded the company with cash, prompting the
closing of several Janus funds to new investors. To satisfy all the
demand, Janus created funds, including its first ``value'' fund,
which invests in companies its managers think are underpriced.
</P>
<P>
   The Janus Fund, which Craig managed for 13 years through the end
of 1999, has swollen to $48 billion. It had an average annual gain
of 19 percent while he ran it, but so far this year it has posted a
slim loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulation of the flow of the money into the firm is the
biggest issue,'' Craig said. He said neither he nor anyone else at
Janus had second thoughts about the company's philosophy of loading
up on stocks of the companies they think will dominate the
fastest-growing industries.
</P>
<P>
   That approach made Janus one of the biggest owners of the
Finnish cellular phone maker Nokia, as well as Cisco Systems and
Sun Microsystems. Those stocks were major holdings of several of
its funds, making it difficult for investors to own more than one
Janus fund with having a heavy exposure to a handful of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he planned to use a similar investing style in
managing money for the Craig Family Foundation, though he probably
will buy stocks of companies that are too small for a giant Janus
Fund to bother with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a stock jockey and never really aspired to be the
M.B.A./C.E.O. type,'' he said. ``Essentially, I'm trading working
at Janus for going to work for my wife. I'll make the money and she
will hopefully deploy it in a way that has some impact in helping
the disadvantaged in our local community.''

BUCHANAN, PEROT SUPPORTERS SQUARE OFF AGAIN 
 

</HEADLINE>
 PARTY 8/10-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Dismissing his Reform Party opponents as
outnumbered, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan arrived here
Wednesday to claim the party's presidential nomination and
characterized the factional dispute as ``real politics in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   For a second day, Buchanan supporters squared off against
activists loyal to party founder Ross Perot, each claiming to be
the legitimate Reform Party and rightful heirs to $12.6 million in
federal money for the party's fall presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see, just by ourselves, taking a look at the
energy and fire and the numbers here, this nomination belongs to
us,'' Buchanan said outside his hotel, where he was greeted by
about 200 sign-waving and chanting supporters of his third-party
bid.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about allegations that his allies ``used
storm-trooper tactics'' to wrest control of the party, Buchanan
laughed. ``That's another term for winning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, two separate conventions were taking shape, each with
its own delegates. The parallel conventions might end up nominating
different candidates, which would leave the Federal Elections
Commission or the courts to decide who can claim the Reform Party
mantle and the federal campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   One convention was controlled by Buchanan's supporters, who
secured $2.5 million in federal money to put on the three-day
gathering of party faithful. The other group was led by several
former Perot lieutenants who recruited John Hagelin, a physicist
and professor at Maharishi University, to run against Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the two factions _ Gerry Moan on Buchanan's side and
Jim Mangia on Hagelin's side _ met at breakfast, then negotiated by
telephone. By evening, they had agreed only that ``we are wrestling
for control of the party,'' Mangia said.
</P>
<P>
   When Moan and his associates arrived at the Long Beach
Convention Center at mid-morning to begin certifying delegates'
credentials, Mangia and a group of anybody-but-Buchanan supporters
had already occupied the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be outsmarted again,'' Moan said, vowing to sleep
inside the building to thwart squatters opposed to Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   When Moan tried to announce that his group was moving to another
room nearby, Hagelin supporters began chanting: ``Democracy!
Democracy!''
</P>
<P>
   Mangia then tried to speak and Buchanan supporters shouted: ``Go
Pat, Go! Go Pat, Go!'' Then chanted: ``We won! We won!''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Truax, a Dallas resident who founded the Reform Party in
Texas, grew red-faced and began shouting, jabbing his finger in the
face of one Buchanan supporter. ``You won nothing,'' he screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Long Beach police with riot gear stood ready but did not
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the dispute later, Buchanan said, ``This is tame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These little tiffs, these disputes will be behind us by
Sunday,'' said Buchanan, whose standing in the public opinion polls
hovers somewhere between 1 percent and 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to Buchanan, a conservative television commentator
and former Nixon speechwriter who quit the Republican Party last
fall, say they will never stop fighting him.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's campaign claimed to control more than two-thirds of
the delegates at the convention, enough to reject a national Reform
Party primary being conducted by mail-in ballot. The voting, which
was restricted to party members, began July 5 and was to have ended
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Verney and Mangia, the Reform Party secretary, have claimed for
months that Buchanan has strong-armed his way to the nomination and
sent out party nomination ballots to ineligible voters. Buchanan's
strident brand of social conservatism, they say, betrays Perot's
founding spirit.
</P>
<P>
   After his 19-percent finish in the 1992 presidential election,
Perot _ a Dallas billionaire _ spent tens of millions of his own
money to organize the Reform Party as an alternative to the
Republican and Democratic parties that was fiscally conservative
but silent on many divisive social issues. &QL;

IRAN'S PARLIAMENT BEGINS PUSH TO RAISE MARRIAGE AGE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's reformist Parliament, fresh from a slap by
the country's supreme leader, who ordered it to drop a bill for
press reform, cleared the way Wednesday for a vote on granting
women additional rights by raising the marriage age.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to raise the marriage age will be incorporated in the
draft of a bill to change a law introduced just after the Islamic
revolution in 1979 that lets fathers marry off their daughters as
young as 9. More than two-thirds of the 290-member assembly voted
for the change, the first major step since Parliament began its
session in May.
</P>
<P>
   Fatimeh Haghighatjoo, a reformist legislator who pledged in her
election campaign to fight for women's rights, said Parliament
would probably vote to increase the age when girls and boys can
marry, to 15 or 16, although many reformers favor 18. The ages
before the revolution were 18 for women and 20 for men.
</P>
<P>
   The debate occurred three days after the most senior cleric in
Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in state
matters, ordered the legislature to drop a bill aimed at restoring
a free press.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill would require the approval of the Council of
Guardians, a generally hard-line body. Lawmakers who opposed the
change said it would be against Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg of you not to vote,'' said a member of Parliament who
opposed the draft bill, Mohammad Ali Sheik. ``Islamic scholars have
put a lot of efforts into these laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But other members of Parliament argued that marriage at a young
age often hurt families and society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a society in which women's rights, the human rights
of very young girls, are ignored under this law,'' one legislator,
Elaheh Koulai, said. ``You see a child married at the age of 9 who
is forced to get involved in daily economic problems. The law must
provide appropriately for such children.''

 &HT;    Saban instilling Tigers get down to business
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ The interview over, Nick Saban was walking a
visitor toward the office door when he paused and turned. ``Did I
smile enough?'' Saban asked with just the slightest hint of a
smile. ``I don't know where that got started.''
</P>
<P>
   It started right here when Saban was introduced Nov. 30 as LSU's
fourth head football coach in 11 years. He'd abruptly left a 9-2
Michigan State team bound for the Citrus Bowl for a five-year, $6
million deal and the considerable task of resurrecting a program
that had floundered under Mike Archer, Curley Hallman and Gerry
DiNardo, bottoming out last fall at 3-8. Unlike Mike, Curley and
Gerry, Saban's come across so far as a no nyuk-nyuk, no-nonsense
kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how he's been perceived, and portrayed, by some
of the Louisiana media. They've found Saban to be all business,
affording them less access to LSU's coach and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always harder the first time around,'' said Saban, a head
coach for one year at Toledo and five in East Lansing. ``What head
shots (photos of players and coaches) mean to me means something
different to him (LSU sports information director Michael Bonnette,
who was sitting beside Saban).''
</P>
<P>
   But then, Saban's a football coach, with an ample
NFL-and-collegiate resume. A coach with his own schedule, agenda
and way of doing things. Besides, does it matter whether Saban
wears a perpetual smiley face here? It's not a question of how much
he grins, but wins.
</P>
<P>
   And Saban expects to win. He sees no reason why LSU shouldn't be
at least a perennial Top 25 team, an SEC championship contender and
a player on the national title scene. Unlike in East Lansing,
there's no Michigan down the road in Ann Arbor here. While Michigan
State was always No. 2 to Michigan, LSU football reigns supreme in
this state.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at the dynamics of which college teams have a
chance to be successful,'' Saban said, ''most colleges have enough
(talented high school) players in a four-, five-hour radius.''
</P>
<P>
   Saban realized the ''tremendous potential'' at LSU when he left
East Lansing with four years left on his contract. So did the folks
who hired him at $1.2 million a year, and who've just completed an
11,600-seat expansion at storied Tiger Stadium, which includes 70
''Tiger Den'' skyboxes. That will increase capacity to 91,600,
making it the fourth-largest on-campus facility in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place should be one of the most difficult places to play,
with the passion and enthusiasm we have here,'' said Saban. ''We
need to make it that way. It used to be.
</P>
<P>
   After LSU went 10-2 in 1996 and 9-3 in '97, the Tigers stumbled
to 4-7, then last year's 3-8 disaster (1-7 in the SEC). DiNardo was
fired with a game left. It was LSU's eighth losing season in the
last 11.
</P>
<P>
   While being courted for the job, Saban asked ``three or four
times, 'Why aren't you more successful?' I never really got the
answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   Saban brought here his attacking 4-3 defensive style that worked
so well in East Lansing to LSU. He has a new, imaginative offensive
coordinator in Jimbo Fisher, good offensive talent but little depth
on either line. He inherits most of a group that suffered three
agonizing, last-minute road losses last season: One-pointers at
Georgia and Mississippi State and a 23-17 defeat at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback job is open between two QBs who shared it last
season: Josh Booty and Rohan Davey, who missed spring practice
after knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because Rohan wasn't (practicing) in the spring, it's almost
like you're making a decision with a hand over one eye,'' Saban
said. ''It might be more than one guy. They have different styles.
If that's not a problem for your team, it can be a problem for the
other team.''
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't that be something for Saban to smile about?

PLENTY OF ROOM AT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As recruiting season swings into full force after
the conclusion of the July evaluation period, the UCLA men's
basketball coaches are letting everyone know this: good seats are
still available.
</P>
<P>
   With at least six players _ including Dan Gadzuric, Jason Kapono
and Earl Watson _ likely gone after next season, incoming freshmen
needn't worry about parking themselves at the end of the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fey, a 6-foot-11 center from Olympia, Wash., Monday
became the first to sign. Who's next?
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting at UCLA as a freshman looks lovely to a player,''
said Aaron Miles, a point guard from Portland's Jefferson High.
</P>
<P>
   Miles, who is 6-foot, 165 pounds, is widely considered the best
point guard in the West and would give the Bruins their first
pass-first point guard since Cameron Dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are after several of the best players in Southern
California: Lakewood Mayfair guard Josh Childress, Santa Ana Mater
Dei guard Cedric Bozeman and center Jamal Sampson, and Redondo
guard Dijon Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Bruins lose six players, they can only sign five
freshman. A new NCAA rule goes into effect this year prohibiting
schools from signing more than five players in one year or more
than eight in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the Bruins are going head-to-head with Kansas
over Miles, Bozeman and Childress. That may add to the significance
of the season-opener between the teams _ Nov. 9 at Madison Square
Garden, the second day of the November signing period.
</P>
<P>
   Childress, Bozeman and Sampson have been longtime friends and
teammates on the Southern California All-Stars. However, Childress
concedes it's unlikely all three will attend the same school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice,'' said Childress. ``But it's not a deciding
factor. As it looks now, I don't know if we'll all be going
(somewhere) together.''
</P>
<P>
   Others the Bruins are recruiting include Chuck Hayes, a 6-6
power forward from Modesto; Matt Carroll, a 6-8 inside-outside
forward from suburban Denver; Andre Patterson, a 6-7 forward who
moved to Los Angeles from Fort Wayne, Ind., last spring; and 6-8
power forward Dennis Latimore from Halstead, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Whom the Bruins sign may be determined by academics. Miles and
Childress each said they have a 3.5 GPA and have scored 1,020 and
1,110, respectively, on the SAT. But Fey does not yet have a
qualifying score on the ACT, and Thompson and Sampson have yet to
qualify for the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   SWING VOTE: The decision last week by Pacific-10 athletic
directors to try to resume the postseason basketball tournament
came when UCLA athletic director Pete Dalis reversed his vote,
giving the pro-tournament group the necessary eight votes it will
need.
</P>
<P>
   Past attempts to revive the tournament, which was discontinued
10 years ago after low attendance, had failed because of opposition
by Stanford, Arizona and UCLA _ the conference's three best
programs who would have the least to gain.
</P>
<P>
   Past proposals always have been for a 10-team tournament, which
would be played over four days. This version will have eight teams
and be played at the Staples Center over three days _ the same
amount of time as a conference trip.
</P>
<P>
   If the tournament were over four days and required a fifth day
for travel, ``they'd lose a whole week,'' Dalis said. ``Then, if
we're in the (NCAA) Tournament, they're gone the following week.
It's very impactful.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the role of Fox Sports _ which would televise the event _
was crucial. In 1990, each Pac-10 school received $90,000. Now,
each school would earn at least three times that. In UCLA's case,
it would be enough to offset the approximately $150,000 the Bruins
will lose from playing one less nonconference game.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic directors' vote last week was merely a
recommendation to forward the proposal to the Pac-10 Council, which
will vote Oct. 3. If a simple majority favors it, the proposal will
be forwarded to school presidents for an Oct. 23 vote. Eight votes
are needed.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal is approved, the tournament would start in
2002. &QL;

 WEB INFRASTRUCTURE FIRMS LANDING VENTURE CAPITAL  &HT;     By PETER SINTON  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Like horse-racing fans, venture-capital
investors are placing the biggest bets on entrepreneurs with known
names and proven track records.
</P>
<P>
   One of the top winners in the past quarter was Loudcloud Inc., a
company started in September by Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen
and three other high-level ``Netscapees.'' The Sunnyvale, Calif.,
provider of Internet infrastructure services raised $120 million in
the second quarter after raising $68 million in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venture capitalists invest in two things,'' said Ben Horowitz,
Loudcloud chief executive officer and former manager of AOL/
Netscape's e-commerce division, ``the quality of the team and the
size of the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Loudcloud's case, the opportunity is huge. The company
handles technology that helps new Internet firms get up and running
quickly, eliminating the need for companies to set up and maintain
their own servers and databases.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz compares it to the early days of electricity when most
factory owners had their own generators. Eventually safer, more
reliable and expandable generation systems were developed by
independent companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating software power grids that companies can use to
run their online businesses,'' said Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Loudcloud expects to grow from 275 to a total of 500 employees
by the end of the year. Horowitz figures the most recent $120
million infusion will last ``deep into 2001'' before a likely IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Loudcloud isn't alone in landing big bucks. Despite the downturn
in many high-tech stocks since March, &LR;   &LR; venture capitalists
continue to invest aggressively in innovative startups that are
building a bigger, better infrastructure for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Local companies were the biggest winners in the past quarter. VC
investment in Northern California companies more than doubled to
$8.8 billion in the second quarter from the like period last year,
according to the National Venture Capital Association in Arlington,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Although this amount was a shade less than the record $8.9
billion invested in the fourth quarter of last year, it was $146
million more than what was invested in local firms in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, more Northern California companies raised money in the
April-to-June quarter than in the first three months of the year _
495 compared with 482.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venture capitalists are long-term investors, whose investment
strategies are not driven by short-term market fluctuations,'' said
NVCA research director John Taylor. ``What has changed is the shift
of interest from e-tailing and dot-coms that sell dog food over the
Internet to companies that are building infrastructure and
expanding bandwidth to move the new economy to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VC10 (107876 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &UR;  &LR; Companies based in San Francisco were the biggest winners. VCs
invested in 114 startups headquartered in the city compared with 51
in San Jose, 40 in Sunnyvale, 38 in Santa Clara, 35 in Mountain
View and 28 in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 1,695 companies received $24.5 billion in the second
quarter, compared with the 1,627 companies that received $24.8
billion in the previous quarter, according the NVCA.
</P>
<P>
   Although the numbers from VentureOne Corp, a San Francisco firm
that also tracks VC investments, are lower because of different
tracking methods, they paint a similar picture.
</P>
<P>
   In the past quarter, 1,054 U.S. companies received $17.2 billion
in venture financing, according to VentureOne, compared with 1,084
companies and $18.2 billion in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In Northern California, VentureOne reports that 351 companies
raised $6.1 billion in the past quarter, compared with 361
companies that raised a record $6.6 billion in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One reason VCs continue to invest heavily in innovative startups
is that they are loaded with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is venture capital firms raised a record $46.1
billion for themselves last year, compared to $27.7 billion in
1998,'' said NVCA's Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of venture-capital fund raising from pension fund,
college endowment and other institutional investors has continued
this year. The NVCA's numbers don't include billions of dollars
invested in startups by the growing legions of wealthy individuals
and entrepreneurs, also called angel investors. But they do include
corporate investment funds, which have been mushrooming.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Intel Corp., Cisco Systems and scores of other companies
invested $7.4 billion in private companies in the first half of
this year, according to NVCA. That compares with $9.5 billion
during all of last year and just $1.5 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The latest numbers show Northern California lengthening its lead
as the epicenter of venture-capital investing. In the most recent
quarter, local companies received 36 percent of the total $24.6
billion tracked by NVCA. That contrasts with 33 percent of total
investments in the second quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast, which includes Boston and New York, was a distant
second in the past quarter with 377 companies receiving $5.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of VC10 (107876 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  According to Venture One, about 86 percent of VC money, both
nationally and locally, flowed to Internet-related companies in the
past quarter. ``Rotation of capital, which began in January,
continues to move from e-tailers and content companies to
infrastructure and communications companies,'' said VentureOne
Research Director Sasha Talebi.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 36 of the 39 companies that raised $50 million or more
in the second quarter are tied to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Brience Corp., a contraction of ``broadband experience,`` was
the biggest winner. The San Francisco company raised $200 million
to develop software that delivers wireless Web services through
cell phones, personal digital assistants, TV set-top boxes and
other devices. The company was founded by two KPMG Consulting
heavyweights, Rod McGeary, former co-CEO of the consulting firm,
and chief e-business strategist Keyur Patel.
</P>
<P>
   Comstellar Technologies, a venture-capital incubator for
communications infrastructure startups in Los Altos, raised $135
million. Company President Raj Singh founded StratusOne and
Fiberlane, the company that spawned Cerent and Siara, which were
acquired for a combined $11 billion last year. CEO Sanjiv Ahuja was
the former president of Telcordia Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other incubators for fledgling companies, Comstellar
intends to hold onto stakes in companies it nurtures from
early-stage startup to IPO and beyond. Investors in Comstellar
include Accel Partners and New Enterprise Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Many major VC recipients in the Bay Area such as Metro-Optix,
Zaffire, Luminous Networks, LuxN and BrightLink Networks are using
optical networking technologies to overhaul the Internet
infrastructure and provide faster speed and greater capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, demand for data bandwidth was doubling every 10
months,'' said Arun Bellary, CEO of Metro-Optix, a Santa Clara
company that received $63 million. ``Now, demand is doubling every
six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies that recently landed large amounts of venture
capital are lining up to sell their shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   For example, only a few months after raising $94 million from
VCs, Equinix of Redwood City plans to raise $200 million or more in
an IPO. The company builds high-security bunkers to handle Internet
traffic for companies and Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the winners could be Marc Andreessen, who on top of
starting Loudcloud joined Cisco Systems, Microsoft, AOL and others
as an early backer of Equinix.

 &HT;    Ruiz quietly plotting his chances against Holyfield
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Some 1,609 days _ or about half of an eternity in
sports _ have passed since John Ruiz stepped out of his corner and
into a crushing hook to the temple from David Tua.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your temple of doom. Nineteen seconds into the bout _
or an instant in boxing _ a prone Ruiz heard the last of the
referee's 10-count. That means he was on the canvas one tick longer
than he was upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've probably heard this question about 3,000 times,'' an
inquisitor began to Ruiz, who heard it a half-dozen times alone
Wednesday, ``but what happened against Tua?''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz bit his tongue and answered politely, befitting his
accurate, although impossibly boring, nickname ``Quiet Man.'' If
not for former first baseman Bill ``Between the Legs'' Buckner,
Ruiz would be the longest-suffering athlete from greater Boston
over one faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Ruiz evokes the horrid memory himself daily. ``It burns
in the back of my mind,'' he said. ``I got up, and I realized what
I wanted to do with my life. It got me thinking. (Without it), I
never would have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ride home, Ruiz implored manager Norman Stone to set
up gym time for him the next day and to line up some nasty
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz has not failed since. Quiet Man has levitated quietly to
No. 1 contender in two heavyweight rankings. If he can eviscerate
Evander Holyfield on Saturday, his head gets fitted for a WBA crown
_ and his ears are not subjected to the Tua Question anymore.
</P>
<P>
   If Holyfield is No. 2, why is Ruiz a considerable underdog?
</P>
<P>
   Since the quickie with Tua, who likely gets a swing at WBC/IBF
champion Lennox Lewis in November, Ruiz can count only one conquest
out of those seven against a currently ranked foe. He demolished
Jerry Ballard in 1998 on a Holyfield undercard at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz maintains that the division's luminaries have been hiding.
Lewis' refusal to fight cost him the WBA belt and left the title
unoccupied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox and his team should be ashamed of themselves. I was
more than ready to fight him,'' said Ruiz, who was addressed by
Lewis with a less-flattering nickname _ ``John Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   As champion, Ruiz, 28, would bring more than a new face to the
distinction. No Latino has ever ruled any alphabet group as a
heavyweight. (He is Puerto Rican.) A loner with few friends, he
became absorbed in nearly all of the traditional schoolboy sports,
even cross-country. He has been blissfully married since 17. He
spends so much time with his son, 10, and daughter, 7, that they
are scarely aware of his chosen profession. They have never
attended his bouts and witnessed just one on film.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz's devotion stems from the lingering pain over his alcoholic
father remaining in Puerto Rico when his mother moved their four
children back to Chelsea, Mass, John's birthplace. Beinvenido Ruiz
died of a heart attack three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sad part of my life,'' the son said. ``He never got
to meet my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his father did for a living, Ruiz said, ``His
full-time job was his drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz is so private that Stone, his longtime father figure, was
unaware of dad's demons until this year. It would have been a
logical conversation piece; Stone is a recovering alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mature?'' he said, noting Ruiz's priorities. ``This guy is way
ahead of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   If carousing and womanizing is no recipe for a champion, so be
it. Ruiz cannot imagine himself a middle-age fighter, such as the
37-year-old Holyfield, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to get out of the game a bit earlier,'' he said,
``when I can provide for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   And when is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I become undisputed heavyweight champ.''

QUEST FOR JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY THWARTED BY NASTY
E-MAIL  SQUABBLE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It should have been a match made in heaven, but
instead it devolved into a nasty argument, with executives swapping
angry e-mails, chock full of name calling and threats.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue lies a question of journalistic
integrity: Line56, a slick new magazine covering B2B _ companies
providing business-to-business e-commerce services _ will
apparently pay a price for writing a negative article about
VerticalNet, one of the hottest companies in that arena.
</P>
<P>
   VerticalNet had an ad on the inside back cover of the premiere
issue of Line56 and was going to be a sponsor of two of the
magazine's conferences. But the magazine made VerticalNet the
subject of its first cover story, and when that article came out,
one thing was clear: Advertisers and sponsors don't get special
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The article questioned VerticalNet's entire business model and
ability to survive.
</P>
<P>
   And then things got ugly.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to Mike Jefferies, the chairman and chief executive
of Line56, Donna Terp, VerticalNet's director of public relations,
wrote that ``based upon the article ... VerticalNet has decided
that sponsorship of your events is not warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies responded, saying ``The fact that your company is a
magazine advertiser (and a conference sponsor) with us does not
guarantee positive editorial.'' He said he respected VerticalNet's
decision to ``take your toys back and blow a great marketing and
visibility opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Terp wrote back that ``Line56 comes across as a cheap tabloid.''
Jefferies countered that ``If I was your CEO I'd ... be sending you
back to PR school.''
</P>
<P>
   VerticalNet's chief executive officer at the time was Mark
Walsh. (He has since stepped aside to become chairman when the firm
hired Joe Galli from Amazon.com as chief.)
</P>
<P>
   Walsh e-mailed Jefferies that his missives to Terp were
``impolite and disrespectful,'' and then _ in ``the SMALL WORLD
department'' (Walsh's caps) _ ``a large potential investor of yours
called and e-mailed me a week or two ago asking me for feedback on
what I thought of you and your magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies, using some choice language, laughed off Walsh's
threat and countered with his own threat that he could potentially
jeopardize some of VerticalNet's funding. How do I know all of
this? Line56's public relations firm sent me the entire e-mail
string. Jefferies professed surprise at this; his PR representative
said she and company officials agreed to send it to select members
of the press after a story appeared on the Web at Inside.com.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MEDIA10 (68536 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In any event, Jefferies said the whole thing demonstrates
Line56's commitment to editorial integrity. (Line56 has a number of
alumni of Upside magazine, including Editor Adrian Mello; while the
business is based in Southern California, the editorial side is
based in San Francisco.)
</P>
<P>
   VerticalNet pulled its ads and sponsorships, but Walsh will
still get to speak at Line56 conferences coming up in London and
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll buy him a beer in New York, and hopefully we'll kiss and
make up,'' Jefferies said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Walsh said he wasn't trying to cross the sacred
Chinese wall that separates a publication's business and editorial
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who wrote the article doesn't believe in VerticalNet,
so I don't see why we should sponsor a conference put on by that
magazine,'' Walsh said. ``Why would I write a check for $75,000 if
they don't believe in the company?''
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW TUBE: Anthony Moor has left KRON-TV for the world of the
Internet. The veteran technology reporter will be a national
correspondent for On24, a San Francisco purveyor of Webcast
financial news.
</P>
<P>
   So far, mostly print journalists have jumped to the Web. Now
that video is rising in demand, however, Moor sees himself in the
early days of a new trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to be going there soon,'' Moor said. ``Print
started that five years ago. Broadcast is going to start it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Moor said he'll be free of many of the shackles of local
broadcast news. His stories can run at the length they need to be,
not cut to fit a segment on a news hour. He can report on original
stories, rather than fill TV's demand to ``re-report what other
people have already reported.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadcast news is moving away from news gathering and into
news production,'' Moor said. ``My day was spent with logistics:
How can I find the pictures to cover this story that was in the
newspaper this morning?''
</P>
<P>
   Now he can focus on reporting, rather than trying to find good
video or pretty pictures. ``We don't do `b-roll' here,'' he said,
using television station vernacular for the background pictures
that appear on the screen while the reporter talks. ``Frankly, you
don't need it. People want to see and hear the newsmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Moor was one of the most outspoken critics of KRON's new owner,
Young Broadcasting. Under Young, KRON will lose its affiliation
with the NBC television network, and Moor had said he wanted out of
his contract so he wouldn't have to work with an unaffiliated
station.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not talking about that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish KRON the best,'' Moor said. ``My leaving had everything
to do with KRON and me recognizing that my interests were diverging
from traditional broadcast television. ... We reached an amicable
agreement.''

   ROCK STAR: What was Jim Daly, editor in chief of Business 2.0
magazine, doing up on stage at the legendary Fillmore last week?
</P>
<P>
   Guitar in hand, Daly was jamming, as his magazine celebrated its
second anniversary with a big private party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God he can edit better than he can play,'' said one
staffer, who insisted _ understandably _ on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   TAKE THAT: Speaking of Business 2.0, the magazine takes a
not-too-subtle jab at eCompany Now in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
   You know eCompany: It's the magazine that Time Inc. launched to
compete with the likes of Business 2.0. Its premiere issue featured
a cover saying, ``Now the Web gets interesting,'' with a picture of
15 Internet entrepreneurs standing fully clothed in a swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
   ECompany rankled Business 2.0 with its second and third issues,
with one bearing a cover story on General Motors' effort to
integrate the Internet into its business, and another featuring a
cover on ``What Works Now: 11 Companies That Get the Web.''
Business 2.0 had run those same stories on its cover _ in September
1998 and April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So it's perfectly understandable that Business 2.0 headlined an
August 22 story about Octopus.com, ``Now the Browser Gets
Interesting.'' It illustrated it with a mocking picture of Octopus
executives, standing in a small plastic kiddie pool, pants rolled
up to display dark socks.
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, look for an eCompany story on
Octopus.com one of these months.

   QUICK DRAW MCGRAW: Terry McGraw may be the scion of an old
publishing company with lots of old-world profits, but that doesn't
mean he's not a 21st century guy.
</P>
<P>
   The CEO of McGraw-Hill Cos. _ which owns Standard and Poor's,
Business Week, and a large educational and professional book
publishing operation _ is enthusiastically taking the firm onto the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw-Hill, founded by Terry's great-grandfather in 1888, is
just the sort of company one might think fears the Internet as a
force that could cannibalize its core products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I do think there will be some cannibalization,'' McGraw
conceded in an interview in the Bankers' Club atop the Bank of
America building in San Francisco last month. ``But if you don't
(get online), you will probably erode longer term the brand value
of your better-established product. In many ways, you don't have a
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw believes that the brand will ultimately prove dominant
online. ``In the info glut ... people are looking for reliability
and credibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw's great-grandfather was a schoolteacher who seized on the
changes of the late 19th century by acquiring ``a small magazine
focused on electricity,'' McGraw said. ``He wanted to talk to the
business community about this new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic,'' he said. ``The last 24 to 36 months have done
more to change people's thoughts, to energize, drive, excite people
in a new way. It's a similar period.''

CLINTON FUND-RAISERS ON EVE OF CONVENTION RAISE FEAR OF UNDERMINING
GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore has for months been planning
the Democratic National Convention as a coming-out party for his
presidential campaign and a long-awaited opportunity to step out of
President Clinton's imposing shadow.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill and Hillary Clinton each intend to spend twice as much
time in Los Angeles as the vice president, basking in the spotlight
and raising millions of dollars for their own political projects.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the Democratic convention week, the Clintons will
have raised far more money than the vice president _ $4 million
anticipated for the first lady's New York Senate bid at a
star-studded concert Saturday night and at least $10 million for
Clinton's presidential library at a brunch that Barbra Streisand
will hold Sunday at her compound in Malibu. Each of 50 couples at
the brunch has committed at least $100,000, and some more than $1
million, to the president's library in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand will also lend her cachet to Gore's campaign,
headlining a concert at the Shrine Auditorium next Thursday that is
expected to raise at least $2.5 million for the Democratic National
Committee. Streisand will sing three songs.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore aides and senior Democratic fund-raisers are angry
about the Clinton-heavy convention schedule, saying they are
concerned the Clinton events will siphon off Hollywood money that
would be better spent assisting the Gore-Lieberman ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The stacked social calendar has also rankled some wealthy
Southern California Democrats, who say they have been bombarded by
invitations to fund-raisers and appeals for money. Finally, the
political ailment known as ``donor fatigue'' may have hit
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Gore's convention, but there are two tributes to
Clinton,'' said a Democratic strategist who insisted on anonymity.
``It's embarrassing for the Gores to have this huge event for the
president that will raise money for Hillary. This convention is not
about her.''
</P>
<P>
   How can it be that three people who work in the same complex and
whose careers have been intimately entwined for the past eight
years seem unable to coordinate what should be one of the most
important events of the Clinton era?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer may be that not only is there little
coordination between the Gore presidential campaign and Mrs.
Clinton's Senate campaign, but there is also competition between
Gore and Mrs. Clinton for money and attention, most dramatically at
the coming Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   And for his part, the president is trying to balance the needs
of both candidates, while burnishing his legacy and raising tens of
millions of dollars for his presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   The highly visible events spotlighting President Clinton and his
wife in Los Angeles are not only troubling to the Gore forces
because they drain money. They also put the Clintons at center
stage just as the vice president and his ticket-mate are trying to
occupy that territory and distance themselves from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one adviser to Mrs. Clinton said Wednesday that it might
not have been a good idea for the first lady to use the Democratic
convention as a venue to raise money for her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Several Gore allies said Wednesday that they were not worried
about the money, but they acknowledged that the symbolism would be
unmistakable: On the eve of Gore's national moment, all of
Hollywood will turn out to honor the president, not once but twice.
</P>
<P>
   Convention organizers had already faced a delicate balancing act
in deciding a role for the Clintons. It was partly addressed when
the president and first lady agreed to address the delegates at the
Staples Center on Monday, the convention's opening night.
Afterward, the president will be saluted by the Democratic party's
top donors at Paramount Studios; the Clintons will then leave Los
Angeles on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But the competition over fund-raising demonstrates that the
competition between the two camps is not fully resolved.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The headline event is Saturday night at a private Los Angeles
estate. More than 1,400 people will attend a salute to the
president, with the proceeds going to Mrs. Clinton's Senate
campaign. Among the performers will be Paul Anka, Michael Bolton,
Toni Braxton, Cher, Melissa Etheridge, Patti LaBelle, Brian
McKnight, Diana Ross, Mark McGrath of Sugar Ray, Stevie Wonder and
Luther Vondross. And there will be tributes on stage by Ted Danson,
Michael Douglas, Whoopi Goldberg, Goldie Hawn, Angelica Huston,
Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Dylan McDermott, Rosa Parks, Gregory
Peck, Jimmy Smits, Mary Steenburgen, John Travolta and Red Buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The host of the Saturday night concert is Stan Lee, the comic
book publishing icon and creator of Spider-Man.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Tonken, a consultant for Stan Lee Media who recruited the
talent for Saturday's concert, played down the talk in Los Angeles
that it would overshadow Gore's own concert on Thursday night. But
he also acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton was sensitive about the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton's campaign office pushed very hard for me to help
get as much talent as possible for the vice president's event,''
Tonken said. ``She has been very sensitive and almost pushy for me
to help the vice president.''

</P>
<P>
   Gore's event on Thursday night at the 6,000-seat Shrine
Auditorium features a concert by Streisand, as well as appearances
by Whoopi Goldberg, Baby Face, Boyz II Men and Gladys Knight.
Tickets range from $150 to $20,000. A few $1,000 tickets are still
unsold.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday night tribute to the president also caused some
concern among members of the host committee, who scheduled the
media party for the same night.
</P>
<P>
   Garry South, a top political adviser to Gov. Gray Davis of
California, acknowledged that there had been competing demands for
entertainers to draw donors to Democratic fund-raisers. ``Some
competition for talent is inevitable,'' he said. ``There's been
some jostling here about the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   South said that aides to Mrs. Clinton called him several weeks
ago to propose a major soft-money fund-raiser on Saturday night
with top entertainment figures. He said he did not advise against
it _ in fact, Davis is a co-sponsor of the event _ but warned the
Clinton campaign that she would be competing with numerous other
fund-raising events during convention week.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a practical standpoint, I told them they'd have to do it
in a way that doesn't distract from other activities, including the
salute to President Clinton on Monday and the concert for Gore and
the DNC Thursday night,'' South said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get this in California all the time,'' South said. ``There
are a zillion people coming out here all year long in ongoing and
nonstop fund-raising activities.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``All three events will come off smashingly and
everybody will be happy as a clam and everybody will make a lot of
clams.''
</P>
<P>
   A supporter of the Clintons complained that the Saturday night
concert benefiting Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign had ``spun out of
control,'' saying the organizers ``don't care about Hillary and the
president _ they are promoting themselves, and politically, this
just hurts Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Gore adviser played down concerns about Mrs.
Clinton's fund-raiser, saying: ``We welcome the event for Hillary.
If any of our fund-raisers think we are being hurt by her events,
they are just wrong. The phones are ringing off the hook. We are
doing great.'' The adviser, who refused to be identified,
acknowledged that there had been ``grumbling'' among fund-raisers,
but added that fund-raisers often complained about the hard task of
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   And Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, also said his
candidate was not draining resources from Gore. ``Thanks to the
very strong economy created under the Clinton-Gore administration,
there is more than enough to go around,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One generous Democratic contributor in the entertainment
business turned down an invitation to the Sunday brunch at
Streisand's home. He described the event to an aide as ``a heavy
ticket'' requiring a donation of $100,000 to $1 million in a year
when demand for political money was already intense.
</P>
<P>
   He told the aide he might consider contributing to the library
project next year or later, but felt he had done more than enough
for the party this year.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Los Angeles on Tuesday morning, the president will
travel to Michigan for an appearance with the vice president at a
symbolic passing of the torch. Gore will then depart for Los
Angeles.

BIOTECH FIRM SEEKS FUNDING FOR AIDS TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Bay Area biotechnology firm is trying to line
up international funding to deploy an easy-to-use HIV test in
Africa, where the AIDS epidemic is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Calypte Biomedical Corp. of Alameda, Calif., sells a U.S.
government-approved test that uses urine samples to detect AIDS, a
practice that health experts say is easier and safer than
traditional blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   Calypte has already formed a partnership with a South African
firm to put six mobile clinics into the field. Some are buses, and
the rest are shipping containers that can be loaded onto a train or
truck bed and driven into rural areas where blood tests would be
impractical to administer.
</P>
<P>
   Calypte said it has a verbal commitment from one international
agency to fund the six South African mobile clinics. The company
and its African partner now want to create mobile clinics for other
African countries _ provided they can get international support to
pay for the urine test that costs roughly $3 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, we and our partners have shouldered the
financial burden, but we cannot afford to give the test away,''
said Calypte business development director Dick Van Maanen.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of AIDS10 (64215 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Tom Coates, director of the AIDS Research Institute at the
University of California at San Francisco, said Calypte's effort
should find favor with international agencies and philanthropic
institutes that are beginning to take the African AIDS crisis
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing is really a good cause, they don't come much better,''
said Coates, who helped author a recent scientific study that
showed the health benefits of testing for AIDS and counseling those
who test positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that people do change their behavior in ways that can
help slow the spread of the epidemic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calypte's South African program is designed to offer both
testing and counseling, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the mobile clinic would pull into a village and ask
the village elders to help persuade people to submit urine samples.
The mobile clinics have all the equipment needed to analyze the
samples overnight and deliver the results, along with some
counseling, the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Niel Constantine, director of clinical immunology at the
University of Maryland Medical System, said urine testing has many
advantages over blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of AIDS10 (64215 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  For one thing, it requires skill to draw a blood sample, he said.
Health workers can accidentally prick themselves and contract the
virus. Needles are supposed to be destroyed, but in practice, they
are reused. And blood collected in the field may not keep if it
takes more than a couple of days to reach a lab.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, a urine sample is easier and safer to
collect. Constantine said there is no known way to contract AIDS
from urine, because the HIV virus does not inhabit urine. The test
detects the presence of the disease by spotting the antibodies that
our immune systems create to fight AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Although the urine test may be the leader for ease of use and
practicality in Third World settings, other tests on the horizon
promise comparable advantages.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Constantine said new blood-test devices rely on a
single finger prick to draw a drop of blood, avoiding the needle
issue. The blood is dropped right into the device, which acts like
a litmus test to detect AIDS on the spot. But this technology is
costly. Constantine said the devices can run up to $7, or as much
as twice the cost of other tests.
</P>
<P>
   An Oregon firm called Epitope is close to winning U.S. and
European regulatory approval to sell a test that can detect AIDS by
rubbing a swab over a person's gums to sample their saliva. Test
results would be available within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need all these tests, and not just in the developing
countries,'' Constantine said.

<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ Gov. George W. Bush claimed Wednesday that
Texas doesn't execute mentally retarded killers, although at least
five such convicts have been put to death in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The comment came as the GOP presidential nominee was campaigning
in California, hours before two Texas inmates were executed. One of
the inmates, Oliver D. Cruz, was described as mentally retarded,
though that conclusion was challenged by prosecutors earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Answering news media questions upon his arrival from Texas, Bush
indicated that justice was being served with the executions of Cruz
and a second inmate, Brian Roberson. But when told that several
states have banned the execution of mentally retarded inmates, Bush
said, ``So do we, in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   However, no ban has been approved by Texas lawmakers, although
they tried as recently as 1999 and failed. Bush opposed that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Constraints in existing law, which Bush cited as safeguards,
failed to prevent the execution of five mentally retarded inmates
since 1984 _ six, according to those who argue that Cruz was
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anybody tried in the state of Texas, mental capacity is a
factor, not only during the trial phase but during the appellate
phase,'' Bush said. ``In all cases, mental competency is a factor
in Texas law.''
</P>
<P>
   Queried about his opposition to the 1999 bill to ban executions
of the retarded, Bush insisted Texas' current law is adequate. And
that's the point he was trying to make when he made his
controversial remark, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas law has many safeguards in place to prevent someone who
is not competent from even going to trial, much less being
executed,'' said campaign spokesman Scott McClellan, adding that at
least five laws come into play in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if one juror has reasonable doubts about the defendant's
mental ability to form the intent to commit a crime, then that
person must be acquitted,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's execution of Cruz drew more than the usual
attention on Texas' death chamber, the busiest in the nation. That
is in part because of the debate over executing people with mental
retardation and because of Bush's bid for the presidency, which has
put his positions on crime and punishment under heavy scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's discussion with reporters on the topic ended as he headed
to a campaign event, and he wasn't immediately available to
elaborate. The candidate was making a train tour of portions of
California.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Democrat Sen. Rodney Ellis was author of the bill last
year that would have banned the execution of inmates with an IQ of
65 or lower. Ellis said in an interview Wednesday that Bush told
him at the time, ``I think current law is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill passed the Texas Senate, 22-8, it died in a
House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he plans to reintroduce the bill next spring to ban
the execution of anyone with an IQ of 70 or lower and to make it
retroactive to include those on death row now.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 34 mentally retarded offenders with IQs of 70 or
lower have been executed since April 5, 1984, according to the
Death Penalty Information Center. Of those, five were in Texas, not
counting Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Washington, a 33-year-old black man, was executed during
Bush's administration. Another mentally retarded offender, Mario
Marquez, was executed roughly 12 hours before Bush was sworn in as
governor on Jan. 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of Marquez's retardation was not even allowed to be
presented to the jury. It took a 1989 U.S. Supreme Court decision
to force Texas courts to allow presentation of mitigating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Washington, whose IQ was thought to range between
58 and 69, he was executed on May 6, 1997. He was convicted in the
murder of Beatrice Huling, 29, a night manager at the restaurant
where he worked as a dishwasher. He tied her up with apron strings,
tortured her with a knife and then stabbed her 85 times.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty supporters argue that the Supreme Court has made
it clear that the issue is whether a person is mentally competent
to understand the crime and punishment. As to whether it is moral
to execute mentally retarded people, Dianne Clements of Justice for
All responds, ``The moral standard is don't rape and murder
people.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ellis' bill to ban such executions were to pass next year,
Texas would join 12 other states that do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apparently does not understand the difference between
mental illness, mental retardation and insanity, Ellis said when
told of Bush's remarks on the campaign trail. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sandra and Ramon Soto, a couple in their 20s from Puerto
Rico, called Children's Hospital in Boston last year, it was to
seek help for a desperate accident of nature. Mrs. Soto, a special
education teacher, was pregnant with twins. But the two tiny girls
were fused at the chest and abdomen, locked in the classic embrace
of Siamese twins. And only one had a heart.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Puerto Rico and even the Sotos' own families had
urged Mrs. Soto to end the pregnancy, but the couple, deeply
religious and eager to have children, rejected that advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to fight for our babies,'' said Mr. Soto.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a medical odyssey, part adventure and
part ordeal, for the determined young couple and teams of doctors
who helped them, from two Boston hospitals and half a dozen medical
specialties.
</P>
<P>
   It soon became clear that one of the infants was doomed and that
it would take complex surgery _ meticulously planned and perfectly
performed immediately after the babies' birth _ to save the other.
Over the next few months, the doctors planned an eight-hour
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan nearly became useless when Mrs. Soto suddenly
developed life-threatening high blood pressure. Pediatric surgeons
pleaded with her obstetricians to delay an emergency Caesarean
section for even 90 minutes, so they could to summon the team to
operate on the babies.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the gamble worked. Today the surviving baby girl is
a healthy 14-month old, with huge brown eyes and an impish grin,
living with her parents in Paterson, N.J. Her name is Darielis
Milagro _ Milagro for ``miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Her care cost more than half a million dollars, with portions
paid by Medicaid programs in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and the
rest absorbed by the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The unique operation, performed in ay 1999, was not disclosed
publicly at the time but is being described Thursday in the New
England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Steven Fishman and a team of
eight pediatric heart specialists, obstetricians and radiologists
from Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital, where
the babies were delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Soto decided to talk publicly about their
experiences because, Mr. Soto said, ``We want other parents with
this problem to try to save their kids.'' During an interview at
his home, Mr. Soto spoke with a reporter in both English and
Spanish and translated for his wife when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after learning that their daughters were conjoined and
sharing one heart, the Sotos decided to seek help outside Puerto
Rico, because they became convinced that doctors there had nothing
to offer but abortion. Mr. Soto, who had seen a television program
about Children's Hospital, called the hospital from the couple's
home in Manati, a city west of San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish-speaking translator at the hospital referred them to
Dr. Steven Fishman, a pediatric surgeon, who said he would try to
help them.
</P>
<P>
   During the Sotos' first visit to Boston, a fetal echocardiogram
revealed an abnormality that had never before been reported in
conjoined twins: a circulatory disorder in which the twin with the
heart pumped blood to the other through the umbilical cord. The
condition meant that cutting the cord, normally a happy event in
the delivery room, would kill both babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would die, and that would result in the death of the
other, since they're essentially a single organism,'' said Dr. Mary
van der Velde, director of fetal echocardiography at Children's
Hospital, who diagnosed the circulatory disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors realized that the only hope would be surgery to separate
the twins as soon as they were born. But they knew that at best
they would be able to save only one baby, the one with the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be either zero or one,'' said Fishman. ``There was no
way that they could stay attached and live, or be separated and
both live. And we knew that we would have very little time to
separate them once the cord was cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Conjoined twins are rare, occurring in 1 in 30,000 to 1 in
100,000 births. Many have serious defects in addition to being
conjoined; some do not survive, and in some cases parents choose
abortion. Sets of conjoined twins who do come to term may develop
quite differently, and each operation to separate them has its own
problems. Conjoined twins with a single heart have been born
before, but often the hearts have been abnormal, and few babies
have survived. There have been no reported cases of conjoined twins
with the Sotos' circulatory disorder, Fishman said, though cases
may have occurred but gone undiagnosed, with the fetuses dying at
birth or in the womb, or being aborted.
</P>
<P>
   Most conjoined twins are separated weeks or months after they
are born, to give them a chance to grow and become strong enough to
survive surgery, and to let doctors study their anatomy and plan
the operation. But these twins would need surgery immediately after
birth if even one was to survive. So doctors began planning while
they were still in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what internal organs were present, and whether any
were joined, two radiologists, Dr. Clare Tempany and Dr. Lennox
Hoyte performed magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI examinations,
and used software to assemble the images into a three-dimensional
model showing the babies' organs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-R-SCI-CONJOINED-TWINS-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: babies' organs. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The software, normally used to study brain tumors in adults, had
never been applied to the tiny structures inside fetuses before,
and it took 70 to 80 hours of work to interpret the images and
create the models, Tempany estimated. Eventually, they determined
that the vital organs were normal; the girls' livers were fused,
but surgeons would be able to divide them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, additional studies also confirmed that not even a
heart transplant would save the second twin, because she was
missing major blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to hook a heart into,'' Fishman said, adding
that in any case, newborn donor hearts are virtually impossible to
find.
</P>
<P>
   As sad as the situation was, both Fishman and the Sotos noted
that it freed them from the ethical and moral quandary they would
have faced if they themselves had to choose one twin over the
other, or to decide between a good chance of saving one versus a
smaller chance of saving both.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no decision points,'' Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the second twin could not survive, Fishman planned to
make his incisions as much as possible to her side of the bridge
linking her to her sister, to spare the twin who would live and
also to provide the ribs, skin and tissue needed to cover the large
opening that would be left in her chest and abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Soto said that although the couple had been told that only one
baby would survive, reality did not sink in until Fishman gathered
them and other family members together in a conference room at the
hospital and drew a detailed diagram of the proposed surgery on a
blackboard. He finished by marking a large X over the outline of
the twin who would die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cried,'' Mr. Soto said. ``I guess until then we thought God
was going to put a little heart in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when he saw the family in tears, Fishman said later, did he
feel sure that they understood that only one of their daughters
could survive.
</P>
<P>
   The couple chose names for both babies and made plans to bury
one, who would be called Sandra Ivellise, in a family plot in
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, doctors and the family worried that both babies might
die even before they were born. Their circulatory condition, called
a TRAP sequence, for ``twin-reversed arterial perfusion,''
sometimes occurs in twins who are not conjoined but who have only
one heart. In those cases, the twin with the heart, referred to as
the ``pump twin,'' can die from heart failure induced by the strain
of pumping blood to its sibling. When the TRAP condition is
diagnosed in non-conjoined twins, doctors can operate on the
fetuses to cut off the blood supply to the second twin, which is
usually not fully developed anyway. The second twin dies, but the
twin with the heart is saved.
</P>
<P>
   But that procedure cannot be done if the twins are conjoined, as
the Soto babies were, because the death of one will kill the other
as well.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Soto's pregnancy progressed, fluid began to accumulate
in one of the twins' chests, a sign of heart failure. Doctors
feared the babies would be lost, but somehow the condition
resolved. A Caesarean delivery and immediate surgery for the babies
were planned for the first week of June.
</P>
<P>
   But at 7:00 a.m. on May 30, Mrs. Soto's obstetricians called
Fishman with alarming news. She had developed a disorder called
preeclampsia, and her blood pressure was so high she was at risk of
having a stroke . She needed a Caesarean immediately, the
obstetrician said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do that, the babies will die,'' Fishman said. He
pleaded for time to assemble his operating-room team, about 20
people. The obstetricians gave him 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The team gathered, and Fishman stood by in the delivery room at
Brigham and Women's Hospital, waiting to rush the babies through
the corridors to Children's Hospital, which is next door.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said later, he was unprepared for the emotional impact
of seeing two live babies, and knowing that soon there would be
only one. ``As much as we spent months planning for this, and it
seemed ethically and emotionally simple, nevertheless when I saw
them both initially pink and both crying and moving their arms and
having the same size bodies, it was heart wrenching,'' Fishman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Soto saw his daughters in the delivery room, but, he said,
he was afraid to touch them. Mrs. Soto, fearing that neither baby
would live, said she could not bear to see them.
</P>
<P>
   As the doctors had predicted, Sandra, who lacked a heart, began
to fail almost immediately when the cord was cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to see things change before our eyes,'' said Dr.
Errol Norwitz, part of the obstetrical team. ``She became cool, and
very pale.'' Her blood pressure was too low to measure, she lacked
a pulse and she was not getting enough oxygen. It was urgent that
she be separated from her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeons had to move quickly,'' he said. ``It got a little
hairy then.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies were given anesthesia, put on ventilators and whisked
off to the operating room. The surgery went smoothly; the most
wrenching moment occurred about two thirds of the way through the
procedure, Fishman said, when the twins were physically separated
at last, and it was time to take Sandra's body away.
</P>
<P>
   But Darielis survived. She spent 6 months in the hospital and
required more operations to repair a heart defect and an intestinal
obstruction. She also needed physical therapy and a brace to help
straighten her spine, which was curved backward from her cramped
position in the womb. And for her first year she had a bulge in her
chest the size of an adult's fist, created by a rib cage that
Fishman had constructed from Sandra's tissue and bone to protect
Darielis' heart, which at first did not fit into her chest. But
recent surgery has smoothed the bulge, and she looks completely
normal, with surprisingly faint scarring and a remarkably sunny
disposition, considering all she has been through.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Soto is expecting another baby, a girl, due in November.
But the family has not forgotten the daughter they lost. They hope
to visit Sandra's grave in Puerto Rico soon.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they would eventually tell Darielis about her
beginnings, Mr. and Mrs. Soto answered simultaneously, ``La
verdad.'' The truth.

RIDERSHIP INCREASES AS AMTRAK RAISES ITS HOPES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amtrak's ridership in July hit a 10-year high and
the total number of passengers for the year is poised to set a
record, railroad officials said on Wednesday, crediting extensive
investments to improve reliability and service.
</P>
<P>
   But the road toward profitability is still rocky. While ticket
sales are strong, the gains in ticket revenues so far this year
make up only about half of the money lost because of delays in
introducing the high-speed Acela service, now about a year behind
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad now hopes to begin phasing in the 150-mile-per-hour
Acela trains on the Washington-Boston route this fall, but has run
into technical difficulties. It is seeking millions of dollars in
damages from the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the growth in ticket sales, revenues for the year will
be $60 million to $70 million less than anticipated, because of the
loss of $156 million in revenues from the Acela Express, the
company estimated. And some spending has been avoided, like
payments on the new trains.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak will lose money again this year, but will meet the
congressional deadline of weaning itself from operating subsidies
by the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2002, officials said. It
expects to need capital subsidies indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   George Warrington, Amtrak's president, said ridership was up
because service was better and because ``the marketplace is feeling
increasingly frustrated with the alternatives,'' namely jammed
highways and delayed airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad introduced a ``satisfaction guarantee'' four weeks
ago, and credits that with helping raise patronage. Ticket sales in
July were $107.2 million, 11.6 percent ahead of the same month last
year, breaking the previous record, set in June, of $102.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   People who submit claims under the guarantee get a free trip.
Some travelers say that when they initially complained about
extensive delays or other poor service, they were first offered
gift certificates that fell short of the ticket price. The railroad
says, however, that it has a ``no questions asked'' policy if a
passenger asks for the satisfaction guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak ridership statistics go back to 1975. Ridership peaked in
1990, but declined, as the number of trains and the quality of
service declined, in the 1990s, even as travel surged overall.
</P>
<P>
   Ridership rose very sharply on several long-distance trains,
including the Cascades, which runs between Vancouver, British
Columbia, and Eugene, Ore., and the Texas Eagle, which operates
between Chicago and San Antonio. The number of weekly trips was
increased on both, but ridership grew even faster.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said William Schulz, a spokesman, is that adding
trains had created ``greater connectivity and reach,'' with more
customers riding the trains as the network grew. Railroad officials
said earlier this year that their old strategy, trimming service to
cut costs to balance the books, had resulted in too much pruning,
and a system that was withering away.
</P>
<P>
   The Acela Regional service, which has sharply cut travel times
between New York and Boston, but not by as much as the Acela
Express is supposed to, has seen a 39 percent increase in ridership
over the trains it replaced, the railroad said.
</P>
<P>
   Five high-speed Acela trains are being tested on the Northeast
corridor, and passengers going through Philadelphia can often see
them parked on sidings. But they have had a variety of mechanical
problems, including missing and broken bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the railroad said its basic operations are vastly
improved from the mid-90s. In those days, Warrington said, ``the
organization was on the edge of its seat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in a very difficult position from a cash and budget
point of view,'' he said. ``The approach that was taken, which in
retrospect, was short-sighted, was to nickel-and-dime, to ratchet
back service levels, and, at a practical level, service quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect was ``to begin to dismantle the national system,'' he
said. ``Service degenerated, quality dropped several notches, and
loyalty erodes.''
</P>
<P>
   The railroad was founded in 1972 by the federal government,
which combined the passenger assets of several freight railroads.

NATIONAL DEMOCRATS SEND SOFT MONEY TO NEW YORK TO AID MRS.
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The national Democratic leadership, clearly concerned
that Hillary Rodham Clinton is facing a tough Senate race in New
York, has mounted an unusually early effort to promote her
candidacy. It has already channeled nearly $3 million into the
state _ much of it from large, unregulated contributions _ and is
girding to spend far more.
</P>
<P>
   No other Senate candidate in the country has received anywhere
near as much financial assistance from either major political
party, according to campaign finance records. The national
Republican leadership has not yet spent money on behalf of
Clinton's opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, though it undoubtedly will do
so.
</P>
<P>
   This infusion of money into New York by the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee over the last 18 months reflects how
rules intended to curb the role of big donations in such races have
become increasingly ineffective. Often in league with Clinton at
events in New York and around the country, the committee has raised
millions of dollars in largely unregulated contributions, known as
soft money, some of which has found its way to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The committee sent $1.2 million in June to the New York State
Democratic Committee, much of it soft money, to spend on Clinton's
behalf. The state party in turn bought more than $700,000 in
television advertising attacking Lazio on his stance on a patients'
bill of rights and prescription drug coverage for Medicare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The state party spent an additional $43,500 to conduct focus
groups on voters' views of Clinton, hiring a firm in Washington
state, Strategic Frameworking, that has also done extensive work
for clients in the consumer products industry, including the
National Confectioners Association and Kraft Singles processed
cheese slices.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton is aggressively raising more of this money.
President Clinton is to join her at a fund-raiser in Manhattan on
Thursday night at the home of John Catsimatidis, the Red Apple
supermarket magnate who has been a major supporter of the Clintons.
The president, who in the twilight of his tenure continues to be a
formidable fund-raising draw, has routinely appeared at such events
for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   By relying on soft money to pay for advertising, Clinton can
conserve donations taken in by her official campaign committee. As
of June 30, the campaign committee had spent $11.7 million and had
$6.9 million in the bank. Lazio's campaign committee had spent $2.8
million and had $6.2 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is collected by party committees in unlimited amounts
from any donor, and technically can be spent only on so-called
party-building expenditures, like voter drives, not on candidates'
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, soft-money spending has become virtually
indistinguishable from spending by campaigns. The parties have
carved a wide loophole in the regulations, using soft money to buy
advertisements that promote or criticize candidates without
explicitly mentioning their campaigns. (Such advertisements often
end with announcers urging viewers to call the candidates.) Critics
of the rules cite this change as evidence that sizable donations
are corrupting the system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Official campaign committees, like Clinton's, can spend money on
advertisements that explicitly seek votes. These committees can
collect a maximum of $2,000 per donor _ so-called hard money _ and
corporations and unions are barred from giving.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with soft-money committees. In June, for example, Perry
Corp., an investment fund, donated $27,000 to a soft-money
committee spearheaded by Clinton, while the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees gave $25,000. Several
individuals also donated more than $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising arms of the two parties in Congress
traditionally spend millions of dollars in tight races, but they
typically wait until the weeks before the election. Jim Jordan,
political director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
in Washington, said the committee's early spending did not indicate
that it was worried about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can certainly interpret this as a sign of faith in and
devotion to our candidate in New York, the importance of the race
to the Senate and nationally, and our determination to win it,''
Jordan said. ``This committee spends its money, we hope, as
rationally as possible, and we support winners, not losers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is led by Sen.
Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, who decides in consultation
with other senators and aides how to distribute its money. An
important factor is which candidates helped to gather it, and Mrs.
Clinton has played a prominent role in the committee's
fund-raising. The president does not wield any formal control over
the committee, though he remains an influential figure in
Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign contended that the spending showed that
Democrats in Washington believed that they must prop up Hillary
Rodham Clinton. It said she was hypocritical for seeking a ban on
soft money even as she collected such donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton is obviously having trouble raising real hard
money from real New Yorkers,'' said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for
Lazio's campaign. ``Fortunately for her, the left-wing Hollywood
fat cats and big-money special-interests groups are apparently
tripping over each other to help buy the Senate seat for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has not established a committee to raise soft money but
has not ruled out doing so. And whether or not it is aided by
Lazio, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is expected to
spend millions in both soft and hard money in New York in the weeks
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lazio and Clinton have pledged to abide by a ban on soft
money if the opposition does so first. Yet the two camps have
continued to bicker over the terms of such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   While the national Republican leadership has not yet assisted
Lazio, other groups have. The Republican Leadership Council, an
independent centrist group based in Washington, has spent $500,000
on advertisements promoting Lazio, including one that tries to link
him to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who is
retiring. The council plans to spend another $500,000 by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Conservative Party has spent $60,000 on soft-money
advertisements for Lazio. Lazio also controls a political action
committee, governed by relatively lax New York laws, that has spent
$110,000 this year. On the other side, the New York affiliate of
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League is
paying $50,000 for commercials attacking Lazio's position on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides, apparently mindful that she stirs strong
emotions among conservatives around the country, say they believe
that Lazio's campaign will reap millions in contributions from
donors outside New York, and expect that outside conservative
groups will spend heavily in the state before the election.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Leadership Political Action Committee recently
announced that it had formed the Emergency Committee to Stop
Hillary Rodham Clinton, saying in a fund-raising letter that it was
trying to collect $9 million in the next 60 days to pay for
advertisements and mailings.

DESPITE FOREIGN DISAPPROVAL, JAPAN EXPANDS HUNT FOR A NATIONAL
DELICACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (expands 7th graf, begining XXX Six Japanese whaling XXX, and
inserts a new graf immediately before it and a new graf immediately
after it)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ To understand why Japan expanded its whale hunting
activities last month, despite international opposition, come to
dinner at Taruichi, a festive whale-meat restaurant in Tokyo's
trendy Shinjuku district.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, not a seat or sake glass was empty in
Taruichi as dozens of jovial patrons, ranging from business
executives to domestic workers, feasted on the house specialties.
There were 36 choices in all, including fried whale, raw whale,
whale bacon, whale heart, whale testicle, whale kidney, and even
ice cream made from the whale's fat.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign governments and environmental groups opposed to
Japan's stepped-up whaling efforts might have found the cuisine a
bit, well, hard to swallow. But it was an evening of culinary bliss
for Japanese diners, many of whom grew up eating whale and consider
it part of their national culture and identity that they strongly
defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war, there was nothing to eat in Japan, and we would
have starved if it were not for the whale bacon and steaks that the
government provided us in school lunches,'' said Hiromi Kanomuri, a
47-year-old copywriter, who munched on pieces of whale skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may eat the whale, but we also revere it,'' Kanomuri said.
``How can a total stranger tell us not to hunt whales without
knowing how much this meat means to us? Such arrogance annoys me.''
</P>
<P>
   The stranger to which Kanomuri so pointedly referred was the
United States, which has threatened to impose sanctions on Japan
for extending its whale hunts to include sperm and Bryde's whales,
which are both protected by U.S. endangered species laws. The
Japanese already hunt minke whales, which are abundant enough to
allow limited harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is a member of the International Whaling Commission, which
banned commercial whaling in 1982, but the convention allows
signees to engage in limited hunts for scientific purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Six Japanese whaling ships are currently heading for the
northwestern Pacific with the goal of hunting 160 minke as well as
50 Bryde's and 10 sperm whales, all in the name of science. It will
be the first time since 1987 that Japan has hunted Bryde's and
sperm whales, but few people outside Japan believe the expedition
is soley for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan maintains that sperm and Bryde's whales are now
populous to be hunted commercially, international consensus is that
not enough is know about these once depleted species to justify
even scientific whaling.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting in Tokyo last week with Foreign Minister Yohei
Kono, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that the United
States was deeply troubled by Japan's decision to expand its hunt,
which she said was ``contrary to whaling agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the United States would not hesitate to retaliate.
Under the Pelly Amendment to a 1967 fisheries law, the United
States can embargo imports from any nation that violates a marine
conservation treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Britain also denounced Japan's whale hunt, as did several
conservation groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and
Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese maintain that no one has the right to tell them
what they should not eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are a bunch of culinary imperialists,'' said Takashi
Sato, Taruichi's owner. ``Telling the Japanese not to hunt whales
is like telling the British to stop having their afternoon tea or
denying French people their pate. This is how you start a war.''
</P>
<P>
   A jolly man of ample girth, Sato is fond of pounding his broad
chest and proclaiming that he is made of ``100 percent whale
meat,'' which he said he has eaten every day since he was old
enough to chew.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have been hunting whales for more than 1,000 years,
and there are dozens of shrines, regional festivals and religious
ceremonies centered on the whale.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the popularity of whale meat, which was a vital
source of protein after World War II, has declined substantially in
Japan in the years following the international moratorium on
commercial whale hunts in 1986. But for many elderly and
middle-aged Japanese, the whale is embedded in their taste buds, if
not their psyches, and they are willing to pay a premium to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Whale bacon costs about $150 a pound in Japanese department
stores compared with $100 a pound for top-quality beef. Many
Japanese are willing to shell out $50 to $80 a person to dine on
whale meat delicacies. A sliver of whale bacon about the size of a
business card costs $5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating whale is as symbolic and important to the Japanese as
saving the whale is to us,'' said an American biologist who opposes
Japanese whaling but acknowledges cultural differences in the way
the two countries view the sea mammal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only hope is that younger generations of Japanese will see
things differently,'' said the biologist, who is a member of the
International Whaling Commission and spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Fisheries Ministry officials dispute U.S. charges that
Japan is violating international whaling treaties. The officials
maintain that their whale hunts are permitted by the International
Whaling Commission, which, when it banned commercial whaling,
allowed whales to be killed for scientific purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan caught about 400 minke whales under the scientific
research exemption last year. After the scientific data was
collected, the whale meat was sold to fish markets and restaurants
like Taruichi. Oil and other byproducts from the whales was used to
make cosmetics and perfumes. The proceeds are used to help finance
the research.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the Institute of Cetacean Research in Tokyo
oversee the whaling expeditions. While the institute makes about
$35 million a year from the sale of whale meat from its scientific
catches, it costs about $40 million a year to conduct the research.
The institute receives a government subsidy of $5 million a year to
offset its shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Minoru Morimoto, Japan's whaling commissioner, said that Japan
has resumed hunting sperm and Bryde's whale because research data
suggest that their populations have sufficiently recovered to allow
the scientific catches. The new research is being conducted to
gather information on habitat, diet and migration patterns of the
whales, Morimoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is particularly interested in understanding the eating
habits of larger whales like the sperm and Bryde's, which many
Japanese scientists, Morimoto said, believe are diminishing Japan's
seafood supply.
</P>
<P>
   While conservationists concede that Japan's scientific
expeditions can be justified under whaling commission rules, they
maintain that Japan is using research whaling as a cover for
commercial whaling because the meat ends up in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Japan's scientific whale hunt also say that there are
ways to conduct the same research without killing so many whales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all one big facade,'' said Sanae Sida, a spokeswoman for
the Greenpeace environmental group in Tokyo. ``With today's high
technology and advances in science, the Japanese government expects
us to believe that the only way to obtain this research is by
killing the animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent scientists who are members of the
International Whaling Commission's science committee said in
interviews that they believed Japan could conduct its whaling
research using nonlethal techniques like biopsy darts. The
projectiles are used to retrieve a small amount of whale tissue,
which is used for DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA samples can tell us virtually everything we need to know
about whale populations,'' said Michael F. Donoghue, a biologist
for New Zealand's Conservation Department. ``You simply don't have
to kill these animals anymore for science.''
</P>
<P>
   But Seiji Oshumi, director of the Cetacean Research Institute,
said his researchers perform more than 100 different scientific
tests on the whales, including determining toxicity levels of
internal organs and stomach contents, which he said require the
animals to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   While the legitimacy of Japan's scientific whale hunts is likely
to be debated for some time, the immediate beneficiaries of these
expeditions are ordinary Japanese like Naoshi Goto, a 66-year-old
dentist, who recently enjoyed a bowl of whale soup at Taruichi.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child, we ate miso soup with whale meat every New Year's
Eve,'' Goto said.``It was a centuries-old tradition in my village.
You can't imagine how precious this soup is to me right now.''

 (ATTN: Mo.) By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Verizon Communications prepares to enter its fifth day of
bargaining with its striking unions, the question arises: Has
Verizon received more than it bargained for with this strike?
</P>
<P>
   The walkout by 86,000 workers of Verizon, the nation's largest
telecommunications employer, has developed into one of the largest
and most unruly strikes in years, raising questions about the
company's preparation for the contract talks and its handling of
the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Management was distracted for the first six months of the year
by the completion of the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, which
created the newly named Verizon. And then the company was eager to
embark on a huge advertising and promotional campaign to establish
the new Verizon brand. Did those distractions lead the company's
management to underestimate the unions' intent to transform the
Aug. 5 contract deadline into a point of reference for organized
labor's future in high-technology companies?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there probably was a certain amount of arrogance here
on management's part,'' said Neil Bernstein, a professor of law at
Washington University in St. Louis who also works as a labor
arbitrator. ``Telephone companies have generally not been overly
concerned about strikes, mainly because their services are so
automated.''
</P>
<P>
   The company denies that it underestimated the challenge of
reaching a new contract. ``No company ever wants a strike, and we
most certainly did everything we could to prevent one,'' said Eric
Rabe, Verizon's spokesman. ``Sometimes it's just necessary to get
eyeball to eyeball on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a token walkout like the two-day strike by Bell
Atlantic's unions two years ago, Verizon has received a mounting
public relations problem.
</P>
<P>
   The company's customers in the 12 Eastern states and Washington,
where the strike is taking place, are unable to reach directory
assistance. And regionwide, requests for repairs have swelled to
82,000, compared with 36,000 at this time last month.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Verizon and the two unions representing its
employees, the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, deteriorated
Wednesday, reducing chances for a quick resolution, according to
people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   And on the picket lines, tension has increased between
management and strikers. The unions said Wednesday that nine
picketers had been hit by managers' vehicles in separate incidents,
but that none were hospitalized. Verizon said that union members
had thrown bottles, rocks and eggs at managers trying to enter
company buildings.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 24 union members throughout the region have been
arrested during the strike, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   A profit warning from the company on Tuesday sent shares in
Verizon down more than 12 percent, and Wednesday they fell an
additional 5 percent, to $40.375 a share. Since June, shares in
Verizon, the nation's largest provider of local telephone and
wireless service, have fallen nearly 30 percent, to a two-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The company's woes come amid a nationwide advertising campaign
that began on Aug. 1, using actors including James Earl Jones to
make people more aware of the new name, which is pronounced
vah-RISE-un. And even as chances of a strike mounted before the
deadline of 12:01 a.m. last Sunday set by the union, Verizon chose
to proceed with its advertising plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly not the association you want to build as you
launch a new brand,'' said Martin Tipping, director of naming at
Landor Associates, a corporate identity consulting company. ``At
least people are learning how to pronounce the name.''
</P>
<P>
   According to people involved in the talks, an indication of
Verizon's handling of the negotiations came in the minutes leading
up to the deadline. Only then did Verizon make concessions to one
of the unions' main demands, which would allow them to organize in
the company's fast-growing wireless division.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, though, it was too late to avoid a strike. While
Verizon had also made wage and benefit concessions that the unions
found satisfactory, other issues remained stumbling blocks. They
included the use of nonunion contractors and the relocation of some
work in response to the merger or changing corporate priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts say it appears Verizon did not correctly gauge the
unions' readiness to turn the strike opportunity into a sounding
board for labor's place in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strike is pivotal because the unions are confronting
changes produced by rapid technological advances,'' said Richard
Hurd, professor of labor issues at Cornell University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The unions are not emerging from the strike with their image
unscathed. One union member was arrested Wednesday for harassing a
Verizon manager at a company building in Manhattan. And the New
York City Police Department has been investigating the possibility
that strikers have been involved in numerous acts of vandalism that
have knocked out telephone service in some parts of the city. In
Manhattan Wednesday, five police officers from the Midtown South
Precinct who were monitoring picket lines were doused with bird
excrement and other waste dumped from the top of Verizon's 41-story
headquarters building on the Avenue of the Americas at 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were taken to Bellevue Hospital and treated for
exposure to animal feces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to rule out management or strikers,'' said
Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a spokesman for the Police Department.

   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ Shares of Vitesse Semiconductor jumped 15.3
percent Wednesday to close at $70.31 after a Banc of America
analyst upgraded its rating from ``buy'' to ``strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Alex Gauna said in a report that the company will
experience accelerated growth from sales to clients Fujitsu and
Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he is elevating his earnings estimate to 20 cents
from 19 cents a share for the fourth quarter. He also predicts
strong profits across the entire broadband semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Vitesse rose $9.38 on heavy trading of 10.5 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment on the stock's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Vitesse makes digital chips called gallium arsenide integrated
circuits that are faster than silicon. The chips are used in
Internet and optical network settings.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Aalok Shah of Pacific Crest Securities said the stock
has long been undervalued. Vitesse's performance Wednesday had as
much to do with the strong performance of its major clients, Cisco
Systems, as with its own upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great stock. The company is doing everything they
said they'd do,'' Shah said. ``You're going to see the stock go
even higher than it is now.''

DALLAS NAACP LEADER SUSPENDED, RESIGNS AFTER REMARKS ABOUT
LIEBERMAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The NAACP suspended Dallas branch president Lee Alcorn
on Wednesday over anti-Jewish remarks he made about Democratic vice
presidential choice Joseph Lieberman, but the outspoken Alcorn said
he has resigned and created a new civil rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, national president and chief executive of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, ordered
the suspension. He said remarks Alcorn made Monday on radio station
KHVN/970 AM about Lieberman, who is Jewish, were ``repulsive,''
``anti-Semitic'' and ``anti-NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn, 53, said during the broadcast that he was ``concerned
about, you know, any kind of Jewish candidate'' and he is ``sick of
the Democratic Party taking the African-American vote for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to be very suspicious of any kind of
partnerships between the Jews at that kind of level, because we
know that their interest primarily has to do with money and these
kinds of things,'' Alcorn said during the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn's remarks drew criticism from near and far, ranging from
Jewish groups to NAACP members and to politicians such as Rep.
Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn, who had been president of the Dallas NAACP since 1994,
said at a news conference that he had not been informed of the
suspension and instead resigned the post. He also announced the
creation of the Coalition for the Advancement of Civil Rights, an
organization created by him for people who are dissatisfied with
the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn said that in his remarks on the broadcast, he was
referring to Lieberman raising millions of dollars in New York. He
said he misspoke by making reference to Jews and should have made
sure his comments were directed at Lieberman, whose views he
opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I misspoke, and I am sorry for that,'' Alcorn said. ``That was
not the best choice of words. I'm sorry if those words offended
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident is the latest of controversies surrounding Alcorn's
tenure as Dallas NAACP president. He has been suspended in the past
for picketing Mayor Ron Kirk's home, conducting an improper
election and most recently, creating a business venture that used
the NAACP name. Alcorn, who lives in Grand Prairie, founded the
Grand Prairie NAACP chapter and was its president before he ran for
president in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn said he was planning to resign from the NAACP anyway. He
cited his dissatisfaction with his many suspensions from the NAACP,
which he says are baseless, and said the NAACP has lost focus of
its mission.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn said he has watched the NAACP sell out for years to big
corporations that contribute money to the organization. Most
recently, Alcorn said, the NAACP received $7 million for a voter
empowerment program. He said he does not know who contributed the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no longer a focus on civil rights,'' Alcorn said.
``The focus is to raise money. I cannot work with an organization
whose center concern is money.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the news conference, Alcorn said, ``Whether anyone wants
to admit it, the relationship between African-Americans and
American Jews has been tenuous at best for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   The national NAACP office said in a statement that Alcorn's
views are not shared in the NAACP community. Lieberman, of
Connecticut, received an ``A'' for his voting record on civil
rights issues, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud of our long-standing relationship with the Jewish
community, and I personally will not tolerate statements that run
counter to the history and beliefs of the NAACP in that regard,''
Mfume said. ``Joe Lieberman is a man of deep integrity who I've had
the opportunity to serve with as a member of Congress. He is a
friend and a fighter for all that is good and decent in our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bledsoe, president of the Texas State Conference of the
NAACP, said, ``We feel the selection of Senator Lieberman was a
momentous occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said in a statement that she was disappointed with the
``insensitivity'' displayed by Alcorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a life NAACP member, I was extremely disappointed to hear
the shortsighted comments offered by Mr. Alcorn,'' Johnson said.
``We have fought too hard in this country to tolerate any kind of
insensitive rhetoric. Mr. Alcorn did not speak for the vast
majority of NAACP members nor the vast majority of
African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Jewish Congress, based in New York, congratulated
Mfume for his ``spontaneous and vigorous response'' to the
``blatantly anti-Semitic remarks'' of Alcorn, according to a news
release from the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take more than one bigot like Alcorn to shake the
sense of fellowship of American Jews with the NAACP and black
America,'' American Jewish Congress President Jack Rosen and
Executive Director Phil Baum said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League praised Mfume for his ``swift and
unconditional'' condemnation of Alcorn.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking at the White House shortly
after receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom, said: ``I
support Lieberman being on that ticket strongly. When we live in
our faith, we live under the law. He is a firewall of exemplary
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Alcorn's remarks indicate a coming backlash of
anti-Semitism, Jackson said: ``We're going to have more expressions
of darkness, but we're also going to have more expressions of
light. The forces of light will dispel those forces of darkness. We
will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Fields, the first vice president of the Dallas branch,
will assume presidential duties. The national NAACP board will
appoint a panel to review the allegations against Alcorn, who may
request a full hearing. A final decision on Alcorn's suspension
might be made at the board's October meeting, NAACP officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the remarks, Alcorn's appointment to the Grand
Prairie Parks Board is also being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed in the statements he allegedly made,''
Grand Prairie Mayor Charles England said. ``I plan to talk to Lee,
and if he did say that, it creates a real credibility problem for
him serving on any board or city commission.''
</P>
<P>
   England said he has questioned Alcorn's leadership in the
African-American community since Alcorn became president of the
Dallas NAACP branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My observation has been that every time the black community
takes a step forward, the comments he's made puts them two steps
back,'' England said. ``What he's after is noble, but the methods
he uses don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn said he doesn't plan to resign his parks board seat. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: JETS LEARNING FROM PARCELLS AND JOHNSON

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Curtis Martin was in a playful mood Wednesday.
Professional football is serious stuff but after six years in the
National Football League he has earned the right to take a
lighthearted look at his profession.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked Martin if he wanted an expanded role this
season he chuckled, ``I'd like it to grow; that depends on Groh.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was referring to Al Groh, the Jets' first-year head
coach. The touch of humor reflected the ease of the veteran running
back and the mood of Jets Camp 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The organization _ from players to front office, has talked
about moving out of the Bill Parcells era. It is unclear whether
that era will end any time soon. Parcells' fingerprints are all
over these Jets. He's still in the front office as the director of
football operations.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants to turn the page but at the same time they want
to recapture the magic of 1998, when they came within a game of
reaching the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, the Jets will need players like Martin and
Aaron Glenn to apply the lessons they learned under Parcells.
They'll have to be the brakes that keep the franchise from skidding
into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Glenn and Martin talked about Parcells' influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me mental toughness,'' said Glenn, who made his
first Pro Bowl under Parcells. ``When I first got in this league, I
was just a young guy just trying to play; he taught me another
aspect of the game of great players play when they have nicks and
bruises. He taught me how to mentally block a lot of things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin looks sharper than ever. He said his accelerated summer
conditioning program was inspired by something Parcells told him
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said something to me that kind of changed my outlook on
conditioning,'' Martin said. ``He said `Son, there's a difference
between routine and commitment. Some guys just do the routine over
and over again, but some guys are committed to getting better.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a guy that's committed to getting better. What he said
just took my commitment to another level. Sometimes you need
somebody to say something to you that sparks something new in you;
that's something that he spoke that sparked a new flame, a higher
flame in me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The different things he taught me are things that have built a
foundation for my career. He taught me about mental toughness, he
taught me about the attitude to have on the field, he taught me
about work ethics that I'll never forget. And those things have
built my career. Coming into the league now, without Bill, if this
was my rookie year, I don't believe I would have the success that I
have had.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Groh, Martin said he never got to know the new
head coach until last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In getting to know the way he thinks, he's very similar. Al is
a principled guy,'' Martin said. ``He is a very wise coach, he's
much smarter that I thought. He's really encouraged me with the
wisdom that he has as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh is part of a new foundation of a new structure. I wondered
whether the Jets' progress from 1996, when they were 1-15, to now
might be compromised by jettisoning a player like Keyshawn Johnson
and losing a coach like Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson still can't understand the trade. He received his money
from Tampa Bay but can't understand why a team so close to
achieving its goal would get rid of its best player.
</P>
<P>
   In one interview Johnson said that Groh ``doesn't want to have
the responsibility of losing with a Bill Parcells team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least he builds his own team and he can tell people, `We're
rebuilding, we're rebuilding,' ''Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Groh couldn't deal with Johnson's individualism; maybe
Johnson was such a dominant personality that others, including a
first-year coach, would have difficulty finding their own voice.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Anderson, one of Johnson's best friends on the team, said
that in a football sense, the offense is closer now that Parcells
is upstairs, Johnson in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen and teams come together and some fall apart,''
he said. ``It seems like we're closing in a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh announced Wednesday that the speedy Dedric Ward would
replace Johnson as the other starting wide receiver along with
Wayne Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   Life moves on, the game moves on. The Jets seem to be getting on
with their football lives.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn had better get on with his.

NRA TO CONDEMN DEMOCRATS DURING CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., W.Va., Ky., Tenn., Pa., Mo. and Ark.) By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Rifle Association said Wednesday that
it planned to run newspaper and television advertisements during
the Democratic National Convention next week attacking the party
for wanting ``to destroy the Second Amendment,'' in what the
association's leaders called an effort to divide the Democrats'
conservative and liberal wings over gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In the television spot, which is expected to begin running on
cable television news shows this weekend, the actor Charlton
Heston, who is also president of the rifle association, looks into
the camera and calls the Clinton administration ``the most anti-gun
White House in history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From anti-gun mayors and marchers to gun-hating celebrities
and politicians, they're almost all Democrats,'' Heston says.
``Tell me: Why are so few Democrats willing to defend
constitutional freedom?''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has made no secret of its antipathy toward Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore, vowing to throw its resources into
defeating Gore this fall. The group, which has pledged to spend
more than $15 million helping state and federal candidates this
year, has yet to endorse Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W.
Bush. But its leaders have made clear that they think Bush's record
on gun issues in Texas is to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the group's close ties to the Republican Party, it
has never before taken such a broad swipe at the Democratic Party,
rifle association leaders said Wednesday. Indeed, the group
maintains good relations with about 50 Democratic members of
Congress, and is spending nearly $50,000 on a reception at the
convention honoring the Democrats' conservative Blue Dog Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne LaPierre, the NRA executive vice president, said
Wednesday that the association would be using its advertising to
hammer home the assertion that the national Democratic Party had
lost touch with its more rural, conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   And LaPierre asserted that Gore's support for strong gun laws
would hurt him in several swing states that have many hunters and
gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, you're seeing a major wedge issue
splitting the national party with its base in places like Michigan,
West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Missouri and
Arkansas,'' LaPierre said. ``My guess is that their polls show they
are getting skewered in all those states.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he declined to give details on the cost of the
advertisements, LaPierre said the group was spending nearly $1
million for the television commercials, which will also run on
network morning shows, and advertisements in USA Today and The Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said, ``The
ad is misleading because we support Second Amendment rights and
want to protect those rights for law-abiding gun owners and
sportsmen, while promoting common-sense policies to keep guns away
from kids and criminals.''

   POLL SHOWS BUSH GAINING IN CALIFORNIA
</P>
<P>
   All year, California polls have shown Al Gore holding a
comfortable 10-point lead in a must-win state for the Democrats.
But a new survey, finished as the Republican National Convention
was ending last week, shows Gov. George W. Bush of Texas running
almost even with Gore here for the first time. The poll, by the
Public Policy Institute of California, found Gore winning 40
percent of likely voters to 37 percent for Bush, and 8 percent for
the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 998 likely voters was conducted July 28 to Aug. 4,
and has a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS GUN FINDINGS
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Policy Center, a nonprofit group promoting gun
control, released a report Wednesday showing that 3,370 people with
licenses to carry concealed handguns in Texas had been arrested for
crimes since the state's law authorizing concealed weapons took
effect in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Center officials said the report refuted the National Rifle
Association's contentions that only law-abiding people want the
permits and that the law has reduced crime. Linda Edwards, a
spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush, who signed the law, said other
studies had shown that people without the permits were more likely
to commit crimes than people with permits. Edwards called the study
``partisan'' for singling out Texas. Center officials said they
picked Texas because it had compiled better statistics.

   EGYPT: DEFENDING PEACE EFFORTS
</P>
<P>
   In the first high-level response to Clinton administration
critics, Osama el-Baz, an aide to President Hosni Mubarak, gave a
spirited defense of the Egyptian role in advancing Arab-Israeli
peace. ``It is utter nonsense to think we are urging the
Palestinian negotiators to harden their positions,'' he said. ``We
have every interest to encourage a closing of the gap between the
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: PARTY MAY BE BANNED
</P>
<P>
   The government held talks with leaders of the country's 16
states over a possible ban on the rightist National Democratic
Party, which is viewed by some politicians as a force with links to
anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic attacks. The party is too small to
be represented in Parliament. A party may be banned by the
Constitutional Court if it is deemed to be a danger to democracy,
but no such ban has been approved since the 1950s, when the
Communist Party was outlawed in West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: UNDIPLOMATIC COMMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Germany's ambassador-designate to Israel, Rudolf Dressler, faced
virulent protest after saying in a newspaper interview that he
favored the establishment of an ``international administration''
for Jerusalem. Dressler, a longtime member of the governing Social
Democratic party, is to take up his post on Sept. 1. In a
statement, he pledged not to express the views voiced in the
interview once he becomes ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY: MANEUVERING FOR DISMISSALS
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's office scheduled a meeting of
government ministers for Thursday to discuss options after
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed a decree that would have
allowed the dismissal of thousands of civil servants suspected of
involvement in separatist or Islamic fundamentalist activities. The
Ecevit government tried to make the change through a decree,
avoiding likely defeat in Parliament. But Sezer, the presiding
judge of Turkey's Constitutional Court until he was elected
president in May, said the proposed change required parliamentary
approval.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA: CONSERVATIVES DEFECT
</P>
<P>
   The rightist Canadian Alliance won a major breakthrough in
Quebec, the nation's second-most populous province, with the
defection of half of the executive leadership of the Quebec
Conservative Party as well as the party presidents for 25
districts. The switch culminated a two-week stay in Quebec by
Stockwell Day, leader of the alliance, which is trying to expand
its base.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN: BANNED FROM POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   The military government has issued a decree that bars anyone
from holding office in a political party who has been convicted of
a criminal offense involving moral turpitude or who has been found
guilty of violating the anti-terrorism act. The decree would seem
to prohibit former Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto
from any leadership role in politics.
</P>
<P>
   IVORY COAST: GENERAL SEEKS PRESIDENCY
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Robert Guei, who seized power in a coup last year, declared
his interest in running as a candidate in the presidential election
scheduled for September. The general said he would seek the
nomination of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, which had held
power since independence four decades ago until the former
president, Henri Konan Bedie, was overthrown in December.
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN: U.N. COMPOUND BOMBED
</P>
<P>
   The day after the United Nations suspended aid flights in Sudan,
a government plane again bombed a United Nations compound in the
rebel-held south. On Monday, 18 bombs were dropped near the
compound at Mapel in the state of Bahl-el-Ghazal; on Wednesday
another nine bombs were dropped. No one was hurt in either
incident. But U.N. officials said the Sudanese government had
pledged late last month not to attack official aid flights.

SURPLUS DEALERS PROFIT FROM COMING CONVENTION &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND AND LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sales of gas masks and other survivalist
paraphernalia have skyrocketed at Los Angeles surplus stores in
recent days as protesters, media and adventure seekers gear up for
possible unrest at next week's Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that authorities are girding for conflict, police
officers likewise are lining up at surplus stores to buy battle
dress uniforms and other safety gear, store owners said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think this will trigger another L.A. riot type
of thing,'' said Peter Kalaydjian, whose Recon-1 in Tarzana has
sold more than 100 gas masks so far this month, compared to about
12 in a typical month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who say, `We're going to go down there and
face anything that's coming our way.' They want to do their
protests and they don't want to be interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalaydjian said he has refused to sell gas masks to several
people who appeared to him as ``obvious troublemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are probably overreacting,'' said Los Angeles Police
Lt. Horace Frank. ``It's not that we don't have concerns -- people
saw what happened in Seattle -- but I feel very confident in the
plan we have in place to provide security for this event.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some individual officers with LAPD and other departments
aren't taking any chances, even if it means spending their own
money.
</P>
<P>
   One North Hollywood Division officer said he went shopping last
weekend to buy equipment the LAPD does not provide: soccer pads to
protect his shins, football gloves for his hands and knuckles, and
goggles to wear under his face shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things I need to protect the vital parts of my body,
just in case I do get knocked to the ground, so these fools don't
take a souvenir home of a Los Angeles Police officer,'' said the
officer, who did not want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   He's also concerned about protesters throwing acid, oil-based
paint and fecal matter on him -- all of which he said was seen
during the World Trade Organization riots in Seattle in December.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of unrest is good for business at surplus stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police are buying the uniforms. Gas masks are going big time
to the protesters and a lot of media,'' said Dave Leva, a salesman
at Supply Sergeant in Burbank. ``They say they're going to be out
there and if things are going to get rough they want to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Leva estimated his supply of the popular Israeli army gas masks,
which retail for $20 to $25, will be sold out before the convention
begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 of the gas masks are on back order at Recon-1, forcing
Kalaydjian to order another 400 masks just four days before the
convention is set to start at the downtown Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Surplus stores across the San Fernando Valley report they are
doing brisk business selling black or blue battle dress uniforms to
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The BDUs feature extra pockets and pouches and are more
comfortable and easier to wash than the standard wool uniforms that
need dry cleaning, say officers concerned that protesters may throw
bottles filled with liquids or other materials.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Police Chief Bernard C. Parks told commanding
officers that officers working the DNC cannot wear BDUs unless they
are with the elite Metro or narcotics divisions and, even then,
only with permission from commanders, said Capt. Mark Perez of the
North Hollywood Division.
</P>
<P>
   That has left some officers fuming, especially those who bought
the BDUs as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the standard uniforms, if people throw stuff on them,
they'll wreck the uniforms. And we're going to be soaking wet out
there (in wool) on the hot August days,'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank said an officer's dress must be uniform with other
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief does not want two to three types of uniforms out
there,'' Frank said.

SURPLUS DEALERS PROFIT FROM COMING CONVENTION &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND AND LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sales of gas masks and other survivalist
paraphernalia have skyrocketed at Los Angeles surplus stores in
recent days as protesters, media and adventure seekers gear up for
possible unrest at next week's Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that authorities are girding for conflict, police
officers likewise are lining up at surplus stores to buy battle
dress uniforms and other safety gear, store owners said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think this will trigger another L.A. riot type
of thing,'' said Peter Kalaydjian, whose Recon-1 in Tarzana has
sold more than 100 gas masks so far this month, compared to about
12 in a typical month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who say, `We're going to go down there and
face anything that's coming our way.' They want to do their
protests and they don't want to be interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalaydjian said he has refused to sell gas masks to several
people who appeared to him as ``obvious troublemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are probably overreacting,'' said Los Angeles Police
Lt. Horace Frank. ``It's not that we don't have concerns -- people
saw what happened in Seattle -- but I feel very confident in the
plan we have in place to provide security for this event.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some individual officers with LAPD and other departments
aren't taking any chances, even if it means spending their own
money.

NEW YORK GOVERNOR SIGNS STRICTEST GUN LAW IN NATION 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 
   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ At a place best known as a scene of random,
irrational violence, Gov. George Pataki of New York on Wednesday
signed into law the strictest gun controls in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki presided over an emotional ceremony at the train station
in this Long Island community, a few yards from where a gunman,
Colin Ferguson, fatally shot six people aboard a Long Island Rail
Road train almost seven years ago. Ferguson was convicted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of gun control advocates, state legislators and people
who have lost spouses or children to gun violence cheered as Pataki
signed a bill that many of them said they never expected to see
enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said of the law: ``We hope this serves as a national
model. We hope other states follow.''
</P>
<P>
   When the year began, all indications were that Albany's
years-long stalemate over gun control would remain intact.
Downstate lawmakers in both parties were nearly unanimous in
favoring tougher restrictions, but they were consistently blocked
by upstate Republicans in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki, a Republican, seized on the public sentiment created
by a series of school shootings, proposed a package of controls and
helped pressure the upstate senators into allowing the measure to
come to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has criticized elements of law as
infringing on the rights of gun owners, while the firearms industry
has dismissed it as meaningless posturing that will have no real
effect on violence.
</P>
<P>
   The law encompasses several measures, most of which have been
tried in a few other states, though no other state has as broad a
combination of restrictions. Most of the measures go into effect
Nov. 1:
</P>
<P>
   _ All new handguns will be required to be test-fired before they
are sold, so that the telltale markings they leave on bullets and
shell casings can be entered into a state computer database. New
York is the second state to enact such a ``ballistic
fingerprinting'' provision, a few days after Maryland. It goes into
effect on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition clips will be
banned, mirroring the ban put into federal law in 1994. Local law
enforcement officials have long complained that they needed a state
law that would apply in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Background checks will be mandated for handgun buyers at gun
shows. The federal background check requirement applies only to
federally licensed gun dealers, but most sales at gun shows are
made by private citizens. The provision goes into effect
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ All new guns sold will be required to have trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   _ The legal age for getting a handgun permit and buying a
handgun will rise to 21 from 18.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new crime of criminal purchase of a weapon will be created
for instances when someone buys a gun illegally or buys one for
someone else who cannot legally buy one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gun owners will be required to report lost or stolen guns to
the police.
</P>
<P>
   _ A state police study of the sources of illegal guns in New
York state will be mandated. Most of the guns are first bought in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   _ The state police will be instructed to study ``smart gun''
technology that would allow a gun to be fired only by its legal
owner.

GORDON SPIVACK, 71, ANTITRUST LAWYER, JUSTICE DEPT. OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By SETH SCHIESEL  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gordon B. Spivack, a prominent antitrust lawyer and former
senior Justice Department official, died at his home in New Haven,
Conn., on Aug. 6. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colon cancer, said Stephen M. Hudspeth, head of
the litigation department at Coudert Brothers, the New York City
law firm where Spivack was a senior partner from 1986 until his
death.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer for Coudert and earlier for the now-defunct firm of
Lord, Day &AMP; Lord, Spivack's roster of clients included some of the
nation's biggest companies, including Cargill, Chevron and Union
Carbide. He also represented Coca-Cola Co. for decades, defending
the company's often-challenged relationship with bottlers and
distributors, and spent much of the 1980s successfully defending
Fischbach &AMP; Moore, a big electrical contractor, against bid-rigging
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Spivack's move from Lord, Day to Coudert in 1986 played a small
but influential role in the evolution of New York's legal
profession from a clubby, tradition-ruled business into a more open
industry. As a government lawyer in the 1950s and 1960s, Spivack
won fines and jail time for executives at large corporations
including General Electric and Westinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New Haven, Conn., Spivack graduated from Yale in 1950.
After graduation he joined the United States Army, becoming a
sergeant first class in the Army's medical corps. Spivack returned
to New Haven in 1952 to enroll in Yale Law School, from which he
graduated first in the class of 1955.
</P>
<P>
   That year, when Herbert Brownell Jr. was attorney general,
Spivack joined the Justice Department's antitrust division. Spivack
was the government's lead lawyer when it sued executives at GE and
Westinghouse in 1960 for allegedly fixing the price of large
electrical generators.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Spivack became the department's director of operations,
supervising 350 trial lawyers. But in 1967 he returned to Yale Law
School as a professor of antitrust law and civil procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust was his lifeblood,'' said Hudspeth, who was a
student of Spivack's. ``He lived the antitrust law and believed it
was a cornerstone of our democratic polity and of our economic
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Brownell was a partner at Lord, Day and that year he
lured Spivack out of academia to start Lord, Day's antitrust group
(though Spivack taught at Yale at night until 1978). There he
remained for more than 15 years, while serving on the President's
Commission for Revision of Antitrust Law and Procedures in the late
1970's.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1986, Spivack took himself, 17 other lawyers and all of
his clients to Coudert.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, perhaps, Spivack changed firms because he wanted
seven of his associates made into partners and Lord, Day agreed to
promote only two.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's insane to tell people who are highly qualified,
`Go find some other firm because we got some fixed ratio between
partners and associates,''' Spivack said at the time. ``I thought I
did owe it to these people. Since my own firm did not recognize
this I went looking for someone who did.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the Spivack defection was perhaps the biggest ever
from a major Manhattan law firm, and it helped usher in an era in
which much of New York's legal community turned its back on many
traditional ways of doing business. Lord, Day itself could not make
the transition and closed its doors in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Spivack is survived by his wife, Dolores T., of New Haven; a
brother, Irving, of Woodbridge, Conn.; two sons, Michael D., of
Miami, and Paul S., of New York; and two grandchildren. &QL;

ABC REPRIMANDS REPORTER OVER ORGANIC FOOD REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC News executives said Wednesday that they would reprimand
John Stossel, the news correspondent, for a report challenging the
assumed benefits of organic food that was based in part on evidence
that did not exist. The producer of the segment, David W.
Fitzpatrick, is to be suspended without pay for one month, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives took the action two days after conceding that the
report on organic food, which ran twice on ``20/20'' _ first on
Feb. 4 and then again on July 7 _ had misrepresented tests done on
behalf of ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the executives said, ``We've completed our
review of the circumstances surrounding the error and have taken
the appropriate actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stossel nor Fitzpatrick would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Stossel said in the report that testing commissioned by ABC News
showed that conventional produce did not necessarily have more
pesticide residue than did organic produce, debunking a main
selling point for organic food.
</P>
<P>
   But the two researchers who were commissioned by ABC _ Dr.
Michael Doyle, a scientist with the University of Georgia, and Dr.
Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition
Policy at Georgetown University _ said they had never tested
produce for pesticide residue for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Feb. 8, the Environmental Working Group, which
supports the consumption of organic food, alerted Stossel that the
researchers said they had not conducted the tests.
</P>
<P>
   In a return letter, Fitzpatrick insisted that such tests did,
indeed, exist. When the report was rebroadcast in July, Stossel
re-emphasized the supposed pesticide tests results in an on-the-air
discussion with Cynthia McFadden, a ``20/20'' anchor. Executives
said Wednesday that, upon investigation, they believe Fitzpatrick
truly thought the pesticide tests had been performed on produce,
even after he was contacted by the Environmental Working Group.
Apparently, the executives said, he did not follow up carefully
enough after the concerns were raised.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Working Group criticized ABC for not meting
out stiffer discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous that they are letting Stossel off the
hook and slapping a producer on the wrist after they lied and
threatened an entire industry by disseminating false and damaging
information,'' said Ken Cook, the group's president.
</P>
<P>
   The group has also asserted that Stossel's report
inappropriately implied ABC testing had detected dangerous strains
of E. coli bacteria in organic food when the tests did not
establish the presence of the dangerous type of E. coli. Executives
said Stossel may address that concern during an on-air apology he
is scheduled to make on Thursday.

CBS HOPING THAT A STAR IS BORN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know CBS wants to get younger, but this is extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The network has commissioned a pilot from its corporate cousin,
Viacom Productions, based on the TV commercial character ``Baby
Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Bob'' is the talking pitchbaby in spots for
freeinternet.com, an Internet service provider based in suburban
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's voice in the commercial campaign, which began in
February, belongs to actor Ken Campbell. He might be remembered,
but probably won't, for his role in the early 1990s Fox sitcom
``Herman's Head.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby's real name is Hunter. It's quite a performance because
``he'' is actually a she. The moving lips are special effects.
</P>
<P>
   CBS figures a baby with an adult sensibility and a gruff voice
might be an amusing central character in a prime-time sitcom. Hugh
Wilson, who created ``WKRP in Cincinnati'' and ``Frank's Place,''
has signed on to develop the prospective series.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom spokeswoman Wendy Luckenbill said no one seems to be sure
whether this is the first time a commercia character was so close
to crossing over into stardom on a prime-time network series.
</P>
<P>
   Not Mr. Whipple, of two generations of Charmin commercials. Or
Clara (``Where's the beef?'') Peller of Wendy's burger fame. Not
the lonely Maytag repairman played by Jesse White and later by
Gordon Jump.
</P>
<P>
   David Leisure's persona as Joe Isuzu was transferred largely
intact to his role in ``Empty Nest,'' but the character wasn't
identical.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Varney's Ernest P. Worrell character made the conversion
from loudmouthed pitchman for dairy products, pizza and car
dealerships to theatrical films, but not to a TV series.
</P>
<P>
   It has worked the other way around, with a character from a TV
show pitching products in commercials. One famous case in point:
Ernestine, Lily Tomlin's snorting telephone operator from
``Laugh-In.'' Another: Max Headroom (Matt Frewer), pushing
Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   If the commercials-to-series route has been taken before, I'll
soon hear about it from a reader with a sharper memory than mine.
I'll let you know.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Baby Bob'' pilot is due to be filmed in November. The
show, if there is one, could reach the air in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-0- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   So ABC News has apologized for a February 4 ``20/20'' story in
which its star scold, John Stossel, reported that laboratory tests
showed regular supermarket food was as free of pesticides as
organically grown food.
</P>
<P>
   Under heat from an environmental watchdog group, ABC admitted
this week that no such pesticide tests had been conducted for
``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Stossel had compounded the error when the report was repeated on
the July 7 edition of ``20/20,'' with Stossel insisting that ``in
our tests, we found (no pesticide residue) on either organic or
regular produce.''
</P>
<P>
   This was months after the Washington-based Environmental Working
Group complained to ABC that claims of tests had been faked in the
original report.
</P>
<P>
   The curious invention of lab tests _ ABC says it's investigating
how it happened _ could prove fatal to Stossel's career as a
contrarian debunker on ``20/20'' and on his series of ABC specials.
</P>
<P>
   It's Stossel's bad luck that the ABC apology coincided with an
article by Jane Mayer in the August 14 edition of the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer takes David Westin, the nonjournalist president of ABC
News, to task for a series of journalistic lapses, including
allowing actor Leonardo DiCaprio to interview President Clinton for
ABC News in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Working Group, which also has offices in
Oakland, wanted Westin to fire Stossel.
</P>
<P>
   Westin stopped short of that Wednesday. According to an
Associated Press report, ABC reprimanded Stossel and suspended his
producer, David Fitzpatrick, for 30 days.

THOMAS H. WOLFF, 46, NOTED MATHEMATICIAN, PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas H. Wolff, a professor of mathematics at the
California Institute of Technology who proved several important
theorems in the study of mathematical functions and was regarded as
a top expert in his field, died on July 31 in an automobile
accident near Bakersfield, Calif. He was 46.
</P>
<P>
   Only last year, Wolff shared the Bocher Prize, awarded once
every five years by the American Mathematical Society for research
in mathematical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In that field, which includes the study of mathematical
functions and differential equations, he was ``probably No. 1 or 2
of his generation,'' Dr. Sun-Yung Alice Chang, a professor of
mathematics at Princeton, said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At Caltech, Dr. Barry Simon, the mathematics department's
executive officer, or department chairman, said, ``A number of
times he took problems in mathematical analysis that were
considered impossibly difficult and invented an entirely new way of
looking at them.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he was only a graduate student at the University
of California at Berkeley when, in the late 1970s, he found a new
approach to a theorem that had previously required a long,
complicated proof. ``Wolff found basically a three- or four-line
proof,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff typically attacked one problem, devised new mathematical
tools to solve it, then moved on to a new problem. Some of his
research involved Erwin Schroedinger's equation _ the fundamental
equation of quantum mechanics _and the behavior of electrons in
disordered, glasslike material where they can be trapped in some
regions yet flow freely in others.
</P>
<P>
   In a message of sympathy to Simon, Dr. Peter W. Jones, chairman
of the mathematics department at Yale, said of Wolff's work, ``In
the mathematical community, the common and rapid response to these
breakthroughs was that they were seen not just as watershed events,
but as lightning strikes that permanently altered the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, a native of New York City, graduated from Harvard in 1975
and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Berkeley in 1979. After
teaching and doing research at the University of Washington and the
University of Chicago, he became an assistant professor at Caltech
in 1982 and received tenure in 1986. He moved to New York
University that year, returned to Caltech in 1988, moved on to
Berkeley in 1992 and by 1995 was back at Caltech.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his professorship there, he was a member of the
editorial boards of three mathematics journals.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Dr. Carol Shubin, a professor of
mathematics at California State University at Northridge; two sons,
James and Richard, ages 3 and 5; his parents, Frank and Lucile
Wolff of New York City; and his sisters, Virginia and Caroline. An
earlier marriage, to Mei-Chu Chang, ended in divorce.

FOR VAN ROOST, A TOUGH WAY TO GO (OUT) 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Two shots landing over the line sent
Dominique Van Roost over the edge Wednesday in the second round of
the estyle.com Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Van Roost stormed off the court at Manhattan Country Club after
dropping two crucial, controversial points in the third set of her
match against eighth-seeded Sandrine Testud of France.
</P>
<P>
   Van Roost, of Belgium, battled back from a first-set defeat and
needed only to hold serve in order to send the match to a third-set
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Down 30-15, Van Roost hit a forehand to the baseline that was
called in by the linesperson, but she was overruled by chair umpire
Leanne White. Van Roost then double-faulted on match point, when
White again interjected and ruled the ball long. Testud won, 6-2,
3-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for the umpire to overrule the last two points of
the match,'' said Testud, who agreed with both calls. ``I can
understand why she was upset.''
</P>
<P>
   FEUDING FRENCH: Testud didn't shy away from the controversy
regarding countrywoman Nathalie Tauziat, who is attempting to earn
a spot on France's Olympic team by appealing to the International
Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat offended many players on the circuit with comments in a
book she authored about life as a professional tennis player and
believes that her frankness in the book cost her a spot in the
Olympics. In the book, Tauziat accused Testud of faking injuries to
avoid playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she deserves not to be on the team,'' Testud said.
``She said bad things about different players, and now I think she
deserves what is happening to her.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE TO COME: Conchita Martinez got a preview of her
quarterfinal match against Serena Williams when she defeated
Alexandra Stevenson on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Stevenson routinely bomb serves faster than 100
mph. Such firepower can make life difficult for a player such as
Martinez, who relies on smart, tactical play rather than raw power
to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you face a hard server, you always have to be ready,''
said Martinez, the tournament's No.4 seed. ``It's hard to get into
a rhythm against players like them.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE BUCHANAN COUP ATTEMPT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after the establishment of the Reform Party by Ross
Perot, the party's machinery has apparently been seized _ or
disabled _ by Patrick Buchanan, longtime prophet of the Republican
right. As a presidential candidate, Buchanan has little to offer
the American public except the politics of resentment. But if he
gets the Reform Party's presidential nomination this week, his
tirades against free trade, affirmative action and abortion may
draw votes away from Gov. George W. Bush, unless they help Bush by
making him seem more moderate. In any case, it is enough to make
one nostalgic for Perot, the eccentric Texas billionaire who
founded the party.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Perot's comical behavior, the Reform Party has drawn
support from a wide range of well-intentioned Americans who wanted
to elevate the tone of politics. For them it is especially
unfortunate that Buchanan's takeover attempts have been less about
issues than about getting his hands on the more than $12 million in
federal funds due the party because of Perot's past showings on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the party opens its convention in Long Beach,
Calif., where Buchanan says he expects to be nominated after
working hard all year to take over the party organization state by
state. Anti-Buchanan members are charging fraud, and contend that
if they cannot stop his selection at the convention they will break
off and form a separate Reform Party with its own nominee. A court
battle over who gets the $12 million is considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   The high-water mark of Perot's candidacy occurred in the spring
of 1992, when it seemed plausible that he could actually beat
President George Bush and the Democratic challenger, Gov. Bill
Clinton of Arkansas. But Perot's odd tactical reversals _ dropping
out of the race suddenly and, just as suddenly, jumping back in _
and his paranoid-sounding charges of conspiracies against him and
his family did him in. Nevertheless, he brought a certain
truth-telling to the 1992 campaign, warning of the dangers of
federal deficits, the power of special interests and what he said
was declining American competitiveness abroad. In his 1996 race he
was far less credible as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The only policy that Buchanan has picked up from the old Perot
campaign is opposition to trade agreements. His moralizing and
demands for anti-abortion laws run counter to the libertarian
streak of many Reform Party members, including Gov. Jesse Ventura
of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   When Buchanan walked out of the Republican Party last fall, Gov.
Bush lamented his loss to the GOP. In fact, the party was fortunate
to be rid of his nasty brand of nativism and his divisive rants
about cultural war and the ``Israeli lobby.'' In these generally
prosperous economic times, it is fair enough for Buchanan to try to
call attention to the problems of those not benefiting from the
boom. But it is doubtful that his flame-throwing attacks on his
ever-changing list of foreign and domestic enemies will elevate the
race this year. The Reform Party would do better to nominate a
candidate appealing to idealism rather than the paranoid fringe.

MANY SOUTHERNERS SAY LIEBERMAN'S RELIGION IS A NONISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Inserts 14th graf, After his ..., to update with Alcorn
resigning from NAACP.) 
By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Max Heller had been mayor of Greenville, S.C., for
seven years when he decided to run for Congress in 1978 and
discovered the limits of religious tolerance in the South of the
post-civil rights era.
</P>
<P>
   One of his opponents said Heller should not be elected because
he was Jewish and did not ``believe Jesus Christ has come yet.''
Another opponent, Carroll Campbell, who later became governor,
conducted a poll with the assistance of the consultant Lee Atwater
that reminded voters that Heller was a ``Jewish immigrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller lost that race, and never ran for office again. But now,
as he contemplated with pleasure the selection of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman as the first Jewish member of a national political
ticket, he said he believed his adoptive region had moved far
beyond its earlier distrust of non-Christian candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South has grown up,'' said Heller, 81, who was born in
Vienna. ``So much of the old anti-Semitism is gone now, with all
the new people who've moved in. If the candidate is someone like
Joe Lieberman who is faithful to his religion, I don't think he
would have any problem in the South anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   With his selection of Lieberman, Vice President Al Gore was
probably not expecting to convert any Southern states to his
column, with the possible exception of Florida, which is 4.3
percent Jewish. But both Jewish and non-Jewish leaders in the South
agreed that the presence of an Orthodox Jew on the ticket was no
longer a liability in the nation's most religiously conservative
region.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Guin, the majority leader of the Alabama House of
Representatives, said he had spent two days going to coffee shops
and restaurants in the Birmingham area to gauge reaction to the
announcement, and had not even heard a murmur of discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the sense that his religion is going to make any
difference in the race,'' said Guin, a Democrat from Carbon Hill,
who is a leader of his Methodist church. ``In fact, his being
devout in his faith may even be a benefit in the South. This is a
place where people take religion very seriously, and they like to
see others take it seriously, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his opponents in his last race drew attention to his
religion, Heller said he believed that being an observant Jew was
an important reason he was repeatedly re-elected as mayor of
Greenville _ the home of Bob Jones University and of one of the
highest proportions of conservative Christians in the country _
back in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Friedman, executive director of the Birmingham Jewish
Federation, agreed, saying it was precisely Lieberman's Orthodoxy
that would make him respected among the South's churchgoing
population of Baptists and evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``People respect people of faith,'' he said. ``They value
someone who has developed an authentic relationship of meaning with
his God.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Alabama, like most of the Southern states, is still
expected to vote heavily for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and Guin
wasn't predicting any change. At the moment, Gore is thought to be
a contender only in Florida, Tennessee and possibly Georgia. But
Guin said Gore might actually improve his chances in Alabama by
bringing Lieberman there a few times and campaigning hard.
</P>
<P>
   There have been examples in recent years of Jewish political
candidates in the South whose opponents have made an issue of their
religion. In 1996, John Mitnick, a Republican, tried to unseat U.S.
Rep. Cynthia McKinney in Atlanta, and was accused by McKinney's
father of being ``a racist Jew.'' A campaign flier said Mitnick was
a member of several Jewish groups. Billy McKinney later resigned
from his daughter's campaign and apologized for his comments.
(Mitnick lost a race for the state Senate on Tuesday.)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lee Alcorn, the president of the Dallas chapter of
the NAACP, questioned Lieberman's selection in a manner that
angered many listeners. ``I think we need to be very suspicious of
any kind of partnerships between the Jews at that kind of level
because we know that their interest primarily has to do with money
and these kind of things,'' he said on a radio show. The national
president of the NAACP, Kweisi Mfume, condemned the remarks as
repulsive and anti-Semitic and formally suspended Alcorn from his
post.
</P>
<P>
   After his suspension, Alcorn angrily resigned from the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   There are undoubtedly silent sentiments of anti-Semitism that
persist in the small rural towns, inner cities and gated suburbs of
the South, but public expression of such views remain rare. In
recent years, there have been repeated examples of Jewish
officeholders elected by Southern districts with only a handful of
Jewish voters. Ben Erdreich, a Democrat, represented the Birmingham
area in Congress for five terms in the 1980s and early '90s; Martin
Frost, a Democrat, has represented a Dallas-area congressional
district since 1978; Virginia is likely to have two Jewish
congressmen in November.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's governor, Don Siegelman, is Catholic, but his wife and
children are Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South has grown more tolerant as it has grown more
prosperous,'' said Hastings Wyman, editor of the Southern Political
Report, a newsletter published every two weeks in Washington. ``The
education systems are better, the universities are better funded,
and people are less defensive than they used to be. And we've got
all these Yankees here, now that we've got air-conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, according to the National Jewish Population Survey,
about 21 percent of the country's core Jewish population lived in
the South, a number that has probably grown in the last decade. But
the region actually has a much lower percentage of anti-Semitic
incidents, according to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith,
which reported recently that only 12 percent of such incidents in
1999 occurred in the 12 states of the Southeast region. The
majority of the incidents, 58 percent, occurred in the Northeast,
the group said, with 21 percent in the West and 8 percent in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South actually has a better track record than other parts
of the country,'' said Jay Kaiman, the Southeast regional director
of the league, based in Atlanta. ``We've got fringe groups here, of
course, and you never really know what kind of talk goes on in
country clubs or in the backrooms of workplaces. But I think when
it comes to voting, being Jewish is a nonissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Which does not mean there will not be some suspicion of
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest problem here won't be that he's Jewish,'' Kaiman
said. ``It's that he's a Northerner.''

NEW JERSEY MAN IS CHARGED WITH PLOTTING TO KILL JUDGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Fla.) By DEAN E. MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New Jersey man awaiting trial on charges that he
was involved in a scheme that bilked investors of $100 million was
indicted yesterday on charges that he conspired to murder the
Manhattan judge who has kept him behind bars since April.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Stuart Winkler, 47, of Morganville, N.J., was charged
with hiring a fellow prisoner to kill Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder
of state Supreme Court in Manhattan. The judge has been handling a
vast securities fraud case involving A.S. Goldmen, a Florida-based
firm now out of business, since Winkler, who was its chief
financial officer, and 32 others associated with the firm were
indicted last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Winkler wanted the judge dead in the hope of
having his case assigned to a more lenient jurist. Winkler was
apparently angry that Snyder had increased his bail to $1 million
in cash after he took a vacation in the Cayman Islands with his
family over the Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when he was indicted in the securities fraud case,
Winkler had been required to post a $1 million bond, which he
secured with a 10 percent cash payment to a bail agent.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is some dispute whether the Christmas trip
violated Winkler's bail agreement, prosecutors complained to the
judge, and the bail agent withdrew the $1 million bond. Snyder then
insisted on a full cash payment, which Winkler was unable to raise.
He was sent to the Manhattan Detention Complex on April 11.
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript of taped conversations in the jail,
Winkler tried to hire another prisoner to kill the judge, telling
him: ``Do it. It's a done deal. Don't worry about it. Just don't
get caught.'' The other inmate was cooperating with the authorities
and secretly taped Winkler.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the transcript were read in court Wednesday by
Daniel McGillycuddy, an assistant district attorney, during
Winkler's arraignment. In a brief appearance before Justice Arlene
D. Goldberg, Winkler, looking tired and subdued, pleaded not guilty
to charges of conspiracy and criminal solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors described the tapes, made during June and July, as
``rock solid'' evidence against Winkler, who they said believed
until a few days ago that his plan was moving forward. Winkler now
faces up to 32 years in jail on the new charges. The prosecutors
declined to release any information about the wired inmate, who was
about to be released at the time of his contacts with Winkler. But
Jack Litman, Winkler's lawyer, described the man as ``an inmate
trying to work his way out of something'' by suggesting the murder
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer suggested that there were other excerpts from
the tapes that pointed to Winkler's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, who has heard some of the city's toughest drug and gang
cases, including the so-called Wild Cowboys cases in the mid-1990s,
was never in danger, the authorities said, but her already heavy
security detail is nonetheless under review. The indictment says
that Winkler provided the other inmate with details about courtroom
security and the judge's summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working very closely with the Police Department to
ensure Judge Snyder's safety,'' said Daniel J. Castleman, the chief
of investigations for the district attorney's office. ``There have
been a number of cases over the past years where we had information
that she had been threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge would not speak to a reporter, but David Bookstaver, a
spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said the
indictment reflected ``the ugly side'' of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this is not something that is new to Judge
Snyder, and it will certainly not deter her from doing her job in
the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstaver said it was likely that Snyder would not hear the
stock-fraud case against Winkler, because the district attorney's
office was expected to request that it be separated from the rest
of the Goldmen case.

FASHIONABLE HOTEL SETTLES WITH 9 BELLHOPS IN BIAS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine bellhops _ all but one of them members of
minorities _ who were fired from the trendy Mondrian hotel on the
Sunset Strip in 1996 and replaced by whites will be paid $120,000
each under a settlement announced Wednesday by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had filed suit under the Civil Rights Act of
1964, charging that the Mondrian's owner, Ian Schrager Hotels Inc.,
engaged in discriminatory recruitment practices against Hispanic,
black and Asian job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Schrager, chairman and chief executive of the company, is
perhaps best known as a co-owner of Studio 54 in New York. He also
owns a number of fashionable hotels, including Morgans, Royalton
and Paramount in New York, Sanderson and St. Martins Lane in
London, and Delano in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than relying on typical hiring methods, the Schrager
company is known for using a casting approach to filling hotel
staff jobs, including the placement of advertisements in trade
publications like Variety. The complaint brought by the employment
opportunity commission noted that the advertisements sought out
applicants who were ``high-energy, upbeat, handsome/pretty with
cool-looking individual style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The message,'' Peter Laura, a senior commission attorney in
Los Angeles, said of the settlement, ``is if you're going to create
this hip, cool staff and image, it should include minorities. Hip
and cool is not just white.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura said the commission's investigation into the case had led
among other things to a memo in which Schrager wrote that the
busboys at the Mondrian were ``too ethnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrager said through spokesmen Wednesday that he had no comment
beyond a statement issued by the hotel's general manager, David
Weidlich.
</P>
<P>
   In that statement, Weidlich portrayed the firings as an
unintentional consequence of a bustle that had followed Schrager's
purchase of the long-bankrupt hotel in 1995 and a subsequent
nine-month renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel badly that these former employees were lost in the
chaos of the reopening,'' the statement said, ``and that their
discharge may not have been handled as sensitively as it could have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for details, the company had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine men dismissed, three were Filipino, two were Latino,
two were Cambodian, one was African-American and one was white.
They had all worked at the hotel for minimum wage plus tips, eight
of them for at least seven years. The $120,000 that each receives
will be paid over three years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nine, Ben Ison, a Filipino who had worked at the
hotel for seven years, said that while he was pleased with the
financial arrangement, the real goal had been to call attention to
unfair hiring practices at the Mondrian, in hopes of protecting
other workers. He said he thought this goal had been achieved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another fired bellhop, Rich Brand, an aspiring actor, said he
had been blindsided by the dismissal, having worked through the
hotel's renovation, when tips were down along with occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told to stay because things would be getting better,''
he said. Then, just a few weeks before Christmas, came the firings.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said he hoped the settlement would send a message to
employers. ``Someone like Ian Schrager is pretty well known,'' he
said. ``Hopefully, people will pay attention to what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Mulligan, a commission lawyer who worked the case, said
all the men were good employees who had done nothing wrong. The
root of the problem, she said, was that the hiring was done by
managers who were all white and had total discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Ida L. Castro, the commission's chairwoman, said, ``This
settlement should remind employers in California and nationwide
that employees and applicants must be judged strictly by their
ability to do the job, rather than on nonjob-related criteria such
as their race or national origin _ as in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Weidlich, the Mondrian's general manager, noted in his statement
that the manager who ran the hotel at the time of the firings was
no longer there, and cited steps taken to ensure that ``this type
of thing cannot happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those steps include adding a human resources director to oversee
hiring and firing and help the hotel comply with fair employment
programs. Laura, of the EEOC, said the settlement required the
hotel to report regularly to the commission on those practices.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If politics is the art of seeing your opportunities
and taking them, Joseph Lieberman seized his first opportunity by
writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   When Lieberman, the son of a liquor store owner, was a senior at
Yale University with a desire to run for office, he wrote his
college thesis on the quintessential political boss John Bailey of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see that there was no better way to learn about the
history and intricacies of Connecticut's government than to study
John Bailey,'' Lieberman wrote in his memoir, ``In Praise of Public
Life,'' more than three decades later. ``The hours I spent
interviewing him that winter were priceless, my own private course
in political science.''
</P>
<P>
   The admiring thesis turned into two books, ``The Power Broker,''
published in 1966 and a reworked version, ``The Legacy,'' updated
and published in 1981. But, as importantly, the thesis led
Lieberman to a ringside seat in politics, a summer job at the
Democratic National Committee, which Bailey headed during the
presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Across his career in politics, Lieberman, a Democratic senator
from Connecticut and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, has
written five books that give insight into his range of interests,
his ways of thinking and the forces that have shaped his life.
</P>
<P>
   His second book, ``The Scorpion and the Tarantula,'' was an
account of what he called the ``disastrous failure of statecraft''
in the dawn of the nuclear age.
</P>
<P>
   As Connecticut's attorney general, Lieberman wrote ``Child
Support in America,'' a handbook on how to collect delinquent child
support payments.
</P>
<P>
   This year, having received national attention with his
condemnation of President Clinton for his affair with a White House
intern, Lieberman published his memoir in defense of government
service in an age of cynicism. Reviewers saw the book as a bid for
the attention of Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In most of his books, Lieberman details history. But he went
beyond history in ``The Scorpion and the Tarantula,'' to argue that
if the United States had openly recognized a Soviet sphere of
influence in Eastern Europe after World War II, it might have
helped reduce Soviet suspicions enough to achieve international
control of atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a step, he wrote, ``would have amounted to the
acknowledgment of reality,'' a reality that ``was a fact of
American foreign policy in the years that followed, even if it was
never articulated as such. The passivity of the United States in
both the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and the Czechoslovakian tremors
of 1968 makes it clear that American diplomats have accepted the
fact that Eastern Europe is a Soviet sphere of influence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman can also delve into the personal. In his last book
_ the only one written with a co-author, Michael D'Orso _ he tells
of the collapse of his first marriage to Betty Haas, whom he met
when they were both interns in the office of Sen. Abraham A.
Ribicoff of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no single reason our marriage failed,'' he wrote.
``Some of it had to do with the different directions in which our
personalities and careers developed. Some of it was related to the
fact that I had become much more religiously observant than I was
when we met and married. And there is no doubt that some of it was
caused by the demands my political career put on our private life.
That is surely one of the great costs and risks of public life.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start of his career, Lieberman was fascinated with
politics. It shows in the way he wrote of Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, suspicious of machine bosses, called Bailey ``a
mysterious figure of merciless, manipulative genius. He was not
totally evil, but then again he was not a philosopher king
either.''
</P>
<P>
   But he came to admire Bailey for his choice of candidates, his
love of politics and the unity he brought to the state Democratic
Party. ``Bailey's organization evidently did not feed on the
corruption which seemed to be necessary fuel for the traditional
American political machine,'' he wrote in ``The Power Broker.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is his memoir, ``In Praise of Public Life,''that is the
most revealing _ coincidentally because of the way that it allows
Lieberman to be compared to another son of Yale, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   At times the two men can sound uncannily alike. Like Bush,
Lieberman says his service in state government taught him
bipartisan consensus. And, like Bush, Lieberman condemns attack
politics, ``the kind of negative campaigning and mudslinging that
leaves both winners and losers dirtied and degraded in the public
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   But take a closer look at ``In Praise of Public Life,'' and it
is as if Lieberman and Bush have actually lived in parallel
universes.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman writes of being inspired by the Rev. William Sloane
Coffin, the Yale chaplain and renowned anti-war protester, to lead
a group of classmates to Mississippi to help register black voters
for a mock election in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, has recalled Coffin telling him that the
better man had won when Bush's father lost a Senate race in Texas.
To Bush, Coffin became another kind of symbol, of an Eastern
intellectual elite opposed to traditional values. The Texas
governor's suspicion of figures like Coffin led him to a political
philosophy that considered the 1960s a time of irresponsible ideas
and rebellions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush last week largely attributed the practice of attack
politics to Clinton, but Lieberman dated it back 30 years and gave
both parties a share in the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three decades have seen an unprecedented parade of
betrayals of the public's trust,'' Lieberman wrote in his memoir.
He described a political landscape that stretched ``from the
deception that lay behind the Vietnam War, to the shock of the
Watergate scandal'' and through the Iran-Contra hearings, a chain
of poisonous hearings like the Senate confirmation hearing of
Clarence Thomas to a seat on the Supreme Court, and ``the
earth-shaking impeachment experience of 1998 and 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing books can be risky in politics. Republicans have used
Gore's book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' as fodder for criticism of
the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Republicans say they have focused on only one
particular passage of Lieberman's books, a condemnation of the kind
of opposition research that pries into candidates' personal lives.
It is likely to be thrown back at him if the campaign turns nasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned, this kind of digging does nothing
but demean our politics and defame the people who are its
targets,'' Lieberman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with going after your opponent's voting
record or any other evidence of negligence in his public life, but
digging into his bank account, his phone records, his medical
history, his sexual life and literally his garbage when these
things have nothing to do with the performance of his public duties
_ past, present or future _ is wrong.''

EXCERPTS FROM LIEBERMAN'S BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Subs last line to hyphenate `earth-shaking,' per text.) 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from two books by Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman. The second, ``In Praise of Public Life,'' was written
with Michael D'Orso.
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Scorpion and the Tarantula''
</P>
<P>
   This is primarily a study of the futile effort to control atomic
energy and prohibit nuclear weapons, but if one is to understand
this failure, it is necessary to consider the histories of the two
principal participants in the effort, Russia and America, and to
reflect on the state of their relations as the Second World War
came to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The first and, in many ways, most critical dimension is space.
America was blessed with natural barriers. To its east and its
west, two great oceans have provided security from attack. Russia,
on the other hand, is exposed. Sitting on a vast plain, there is
nothing of military consequence separating Russia from Asia to the
east and Europe to the west. Russian history from its beginnings to
our own time is characterized by continuous foreign military
assaults, particularly from the west. ...
</P>
<P>
   This is not a history likely to breed a nation of
internationalists, a people who greeted foreigners with openness
and were free of suspicion. This is a history that created a people
haunted by fear, who lived without confidence and viewed the world
outside with a sense of mistrust and inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   From ``In Praise of Public Life''
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence did not plummet overnight. It did not begin
with Bill Clinton. Politicians and government have endured
suspicion and a certain degree of scorn since the birth of this
nation. This skepticism on the part of the American public is a
grand tradition, as deeply rooted in our society as the spirit of
freedom and independence and limited government. What is new,
however, is the degree to which that suspicion and scorn have grown
in the past 30 years. These three decades have seen an
unprecedented parade of betrayals of the public's trust, from the
deception that lay behind the Vietnam War, to the shock of the
Watergate scandal, to Iran-contra and the partisan political and
cultural warfare that erupted in the 1980s, to the personal attacks
on public figures like Judge Robert Bork, Speaker Jim Wright and
Justice Clarence Thomas, to the unseemly revelations of campaign
finance wrongdoing in 1996, and on through the earth-shaking
impeachment experience of 1998 and 1999.

LIEBERMAN'S HOMETOWN SHOWS PRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ The committee planning the 40th reunion in
mid-November of the Stamford High School class of 1960 did not get
much done at its meeting on Tuesday night. Its members were far too
distracted by the thought that their classmate, Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, might become the next vice president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need to have quite a few more meetings, because all
we were talking about was Joe last night,'' said Vita Lionetti, who
introduced Lieberman at a Democratic campaign rally here on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   This once-quaint small city is now a bustling corporate mecca,
but Joe Lieberman is still wearing the same smile he did at
graduation in 1960, friends say. And, as he returned on Wednesday,
riding triumphantly in Vice President Al Gore's motorcade, all of
Stamford seemed to swell with pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a momentous occasion,'' exulted Mayor Dannel P. Malloy, a
Democrat. ``It's an exciting time for Stamford.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the opening speeches at Wednesday's rally, Malloy
proclaimed, ``There are 111,000 people in Stamford and there's
111,000 stories about Joe Lieberman, what a great guy he is.''
</P>
<P>
   That Lieberman is the first Jewish American to run on a national
ticket for a major party will forever be a historical footnote. And
the footnote to that, Stamford residents noted proudly, will be
that he was born here, on Feb. 24, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   The banner headline in Wednesday morning's issue of The
Advocate, the local newspaper, was simply: ``He's Coming Home.''
And although Wednesday's rally was by invitation only, people with
tickets started lining up at 3 p.m., four hours before Lieberman
and Gore were expected to arrive at the Italian Center, a
recreation complex and catering hall.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign had hoped to hold Wednesday's rally at
Stamford High School, where Lieberman began his political career by
running for president of his ninth-grade class. But the building on
Strawberry Hill Avenue was not available because of summertime
construction and renovation projects.
</P>
<P>
   Lionetti recalled in an interview that she had been elected prom
queen and that her husband, Alexander, had lost the contest for
prom king by one vote to _ who else? _ Joe Lieberman. ``He was a
winner from then on,'' she said. ``Not one thing has changed,
except his success.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamford ``will always be home to him,'' she said. ``This is
where his roots are and no matter where Joe is, no matter where he
goes, he has a following. We are so proud. We are really so, so
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the afternoon, people stopped to stare at a crowd of
photographers and television cameramen gathered across Strawberry
Hill Court from the home of Lieberman's mother, Marcia. The
candidates visited there briefly before joining the 1,000 exuberant
supporters at the rally, which included many of Connecticut's
elected Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd there roared gleefully when Gore introduced Lieberman
as a ``son of Stamford'' and ``the next vice president of the
United States.'' To chants of ``Joe, Joe, Joe,'' Lieberman, who now
lives in New Haven, took the lectern and became teary-eyed in
describing his emotions. ``It, of course, has always been good to
come home,'' he said. ``But never have I felt more grateful and
more proud.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled standing in the same ballroom at the Italian Center
for testimonial dinners and for previous high school reunions. And,
he added, ``What a thrill to come home on Air Force Two to Stamford
with my mom.'' He thanked Stamford for his public school education
and said that it was mishaps on the town's Little League fields as
a child that led him to a career in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates flew north to Stamford after visiting
Gore's hometown, Carthage, Tenn., earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Lenora Cavaliero, another member of Lieberman's high school
class, said she was flabbergasted that history was being made so
close to home. ``Just that somebody from your own town, as it was
then, could build up and do something like this,'' she said. ``I
guess it goes to prove that when you are that determined and have
faith and believe in yourself, it really can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, in his speech, made very much the same point,
describing his father, who worked in a bakery and later owned a
liquor store in Stamford, and his grandmother, who was an immigrant
from Central Europe, both of whom he said reveled in America's
basic freedoms. ``Anybody should be able to succeed here,'' he
said.

BUSH CAMPAIGNS BY TRAIN   INTO CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KRYSTN SHRIEVE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ When her boss failed to show up for work
Wednesday, migrant farm worker Maria Luisa Lopez canceled her plans
to pick corn and headed to the Oxnard train station to cheer for
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez joined an estimated 6,000 people from Ventura County and
the San Fernando Valley who donned red, white and blue garb to send
the Republican presidential nominee off on his whistle-stop tour of
Central California.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being supportive of the Mexican people,'' said Lopez, 39,
as she stood on the outskirts of the crowd, holding a sign for
Bush. ``We're hoping he will support the Latino community and help
diminish prejudice, and we hope he'll recognize the way the
Mexicans in the fields have contributed to the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxnard resident Betty Moore broke out a red, white and blue
sequined vest for the occasion. A jeweled GOP pin and buttons
reading ``Bush Posse 1992'' and ``George Bush 88'' decorated her
straw hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to come and be part of the festivities,'' the
former president of the Oxnard Republican Women Federated said as
she handed out Bush-Cheney stickers. ``This is the first time any
presidential candidate has ever been to Oxnard. I think Bush just
wants people to know that he represents everyone everywhere -- even
those of us in little towns.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was filled with the sounds of mariachi bands and
children singing patriotic songs. Members of the Oxnard Boys &AMP;
Girls Club sold popcorn, soda and hot dogs, residents scribbled
last-minute slogans on poster board and college interns manned
voter registration booths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget this,'' said 18-year-old Jennifer
Eastlake, who is interning for Assemblyman Tony Strickland,
R-Camarillo. ``It's great to see all the patriotism and hear
everyone in the background cheering for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans were in the majority, Democrats made sure
their voices were heard. While Republicans chanted, ``We want
Bush!'' Democrats countered with ``Viva Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Martinez, a Santa Paula native who works as a counselor at
an elementary school in Sacramento, held a sign that said ``Crees
que estamos estupidos? (Do you believe we're stupid?) Prop. 187: We
will not forget!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pro-child, pro-family, pro-worker and that's why I'm
against Bush,'' Martinez said. ``Republicans are just worried about
making the rich richer and the working class poorer, and I don't
think Bush will be any different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like my sign says, we're not stupid,'' Martinez said. ``We
know what the voting record is and that speaks for itself. As far
as I'm concerned, he can come back here when the voting record
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd erupted in cheers when Bush's train pulled into the
station. White doves took flight as the train came to a halt, and
people swarmed the tracks to catch a glimpse of the Texas governor
as he addressed the group from the back of the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intentions are not just to come here a lot because
California's a pretty place,'' Bush told the crowd. ``We intend to
come here a lot because we intend to carry California in November.
This state is the biggest, most powerful state in the Union, and
come November -- you mark my words -- California will be in the
Bush-Cheney column.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxnard resident Elizabeth Castleman was covered with streamers
when she emerged from the throng.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was so inspiring,'' Castleman marveled. ``My hair is
still standing up on end because I'm so excited. I don't even think
of him as a candidate anymore -- but as the next president.''

<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Vice President Al Gore and his new Democratic
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, introduced each other to the
folks back home on Wednesday in a pair of appearances that sought
to ground two men with disparate stories in the common embrace of
family and community.
</P>
<P>
   The day began in Carthage, Tenn., the picturesque town on the
Cumberland plateau that served as one of Gore's two boyhood homes,
the other being Washington, D.C. Gore and his wife, Tipper, gave
Lieberman and his family a tour of the house they have owned in
Carthage since 1973 and then dropped by the farm where he spent his
childhood summers and where his 87-year-old mother, Pauline, still
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as campaign cameras recorded the scene for possible use in
television advertisements, longtime friends and constituents sang
Gore's praises during a scripted gathering in an elementary school
gymnasium. On Wednesday afternoon, the Gores and Liebermans flew
here to Stamford, where Lieberman returned the favor by joining the
Gores at a raucous rally with local supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a thrill to come home to Stamform on Air Force II,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Carthage, Gore vowed that he and Lieberman would not level
personal attacks against Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
nominee, and his running mate, Dick Cheney. ``I will not say a
single unkind word about Gov. Bush or Dick Cheney,'' Gore said,
affecting his twangiest drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how Gore will define ``unkind word'' remains to be seen,
and his pledge was greeted with skepticism by Bush's aides. They
noted that Gore has used loaded terms like ``reckless,'' ``risky,''
``irresponsible,'' ``smug'' and ``arrogant'' to describe Bush's
policies. And indeed, only seconds before making his pledge, Gore
referred to the Republican ticket as ``the old guard.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation with reporters aboard Air Force II en route to
Connecticut, Gore said he had ``never made a personal attack
against Governor Bush.'' He then said he had once ``slipped'' when,
in May, he called Bush's Social Security proposals arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made a similar pledge in the primaries, saying he would not
make any negative personal attacks against his Democratic opponent,
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey. However, Gore proved quite
skillful at casting Bradley in derogatory terms without calling him
names, although he did call him a ``quitter'' for leaving the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, said that ``if the vice
president meant what he said, it would be a breakthrough
encouraging development.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 52, was born in Washington, where his father served in the
House and Senate, and he attended all but a portion of one year of
his schooling there. But he spent his summers on his parents' farm
in Carthage and he has returned there to kick off his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The event in Carthage on Wednesday was so prepackaged that,
hours beforehand, Gore aides handed out biographies of the
townspeople who Gore called on to speak. Many told stories of
medical problems _ a child with cancer, a kidney transplant _ and
paid tribute to Gore for riding to the rescue with helpful
legislation during his 16 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One man, Mark Thompson, of Cleveland, Tenn., told of riding his
bicycle as a boy to deliver a letter to then Senator Gore seeking
help in securing Social Security benefits for his grandmother. And
as Thompson credited Gore for fixing the problem, he incorporated
the campaign's theme of the week _ ``going the distance for
America's working families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Vice President, in 1989 you went the distance for my
family,'' he said. ``And I know in November when you're elected
president of the United States you're going to go the distance for
families all across this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded, ``We need to get you to come on the campaign
trail,'' as if that were not exactly where Thompson was on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The only comment that was off script on Wednesday came from
Laura Lester, a 55-year-old retired teacher who asked Lieberman
about his support for school vouchers. Lieberman supports pilot
programs that would provide federal funds to the parents of poor
children to pay for tuition at private schools, one of several
areas where he disagrees with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman used the question to blunt Bush campaign
attacks about their differences on various issues, as they have in
several interviews in the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Lieberman said, ``the folks on the other side are
trying to point out the differences between Al and me and, believe
me, the differences are very, very few.'' Lieberman said the two
candidates did have some differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one,'' he said of vouchers. ``And I think it's a mark
of the strength of leadership of this man that he didn't choose
somebody who agreed with him on every single issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he would occasionally offer dissenting advice to
Gore but would ``support him wholeheartedly'' once a decision was
made. Then Gore jumped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to have a vice president who disagrees with me
on some issues,'' he said. ``I think that's fine. Our
administration will be opposed to private school vouchers. I'm
against them. I think they drain money away from public schools.
But I'll tell you this.'' I think it is a strength and not a
weakness, an asset and not a liability to be able to have a
different point of view represented in the room at the time that
decisions are being made.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman addressed another issue where they differ,
parental consent and notification for minors seeking abortions, in
a morning television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who supports abortion rights, said on NBC's Today
that he would support legislation giving parents the right to be
notified about or to consent to a minor child's abortion, but only
if it contained provisions allowing the child to seek permission
from a judge ``when it can't be worked out in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who also supports abortion rights, has always opposed
parental consent legislation, aides said, but he said on Air Force
II that he had expressed ``a willingness to look at proposals''
that do not impinge on a woman's right to choose. Gore aides later
said Gore was only talking about parental notification, not
parental consent, and that he had never seen a notification bill
with adequate protections.

CON ED TO REPLACE ALL GENERATORS AT INDIAN POINT 2 PLANT
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID W. CHEN

<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN, N.Y. _ After enduring months of withering criticism of
its safety and financial practices, Consolidated Edison announced
Wednesday that it would replace the steam generators at its
troubled Indian Point 2 nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point 2 has been closed since February, when a cracked
tube in one of the steam generators caused a radioactive leak, the
worst accident in the plant's 26-year history. Now, as a result of
Con Ed's decision to replace all four generators, the plant will be
out of service until the end of the year. The decision all but
guarantees a continued scramble for electricity from other sources
in a year in which rates have escalated because of power shortages
throughout the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which comes a day after Gov. George Pataki signed
a bill that orders the company to repay customers more than $100
million in costs associated with the accident, represents an abrupt
about-face for Con Edison. Until now, the company had resisted
requests from residents, government officials and environmental
groups to replace the generators. Critics had argued that
structural weaknesses in the plant's aging equipment should have
been detected as early as 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as late last week, Con Edison seemed determined to
restart the power plant with its existing four generators, and had
asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for permission to conduct
additional heat and pressure tests, said Neil Sheehan, an NRC
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Pataki signed the bill requiring Con Edison to
repay customers more than $100 million and prohibiting the utility
from collecting tens of millions more until the plant reopens. And
while Con Edison officials vowed Wednesday to fight that
legislation in court, they also decided to abandon the idea of
relying on existing equipment to restart the plant, which is
situated in this Westchester County town 35 miles north of Midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Stephen Quinn, a Con Ed vice president
who once managed the plant, said that there was ``no connection''
between the legislation and Wednesday's decision, and that the
utility had acted at the earliest possible juncture to go ahead
with replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proceeding with replacement as fast as we could have,''
Quinn said. ``We are talking about bringing in 700 craftsmen,
approximately, to effect this repair. These people are not just
sitting at home waiting for you to give them a call. And then we
have to get machines, and we have to get tools, and we have to do
testing.''

PETTITTE CARRIES ON WITHOUT STOTTLEMYRE
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The faces they present for the outside world are
similar. Andy Pettitte offers a smile and a greeting delivered in a
soothing Louisiana drawl, and if you read his lips on the mound at
the worst of times, the words are G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees pitching coach, is the sort of
person who could get stuck on an elevator and immediately laugh
about it; he is unfailingly optimistic. David Cone has known
Stottlemyre for more than a decade and can remember seeing his
anger only one time, on the night the Mets were eliminated in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The inner beings hidden by Pettitte and Stottlemyre are similar,
as well _ both are seething competitors _ and for all that they
share, Pettitte might be the Yankees pitcher most affected by the
absence of Stottlemyre, who left the team Monday to be treated for
bone marrow cancer. With ample run support, Pettitte dominated
Oakland, 12-1, improving his record to 13-6.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's Kevin Appier was terrible, walking six and hitting a
batter in 32/3 innings, allowing seven hits and 10 runs, and the
Yankees feasted, even after Appier was knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez blasted a grand slam and drove in five runs, Scott
Brosius laced a three-run double, Jorge Posada crushed his 21st
homer, and Bernie Williams banged his 26th home run _ the 18th home
run hit into the black section in center field in the remodeled
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has 88 runs scored, 102 runs batted in and 64
extra-base hits with 53 games to play. The Yankees have scored 163
runs in 26 games since the All-Star Game break, an average of 6.3
game, or about a run a game more than they averaged before the
break.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre was not at Yankee Stadium Wednesday night to witness
the wipeout, to see Pettitte maintain his concentration throughout
a long game played on a muggy evening. Pettitte threw in the
bullpen Sunday, and it was apparently at that time that Stottlemyre
told Pettitte of his plans _ the pitching coach is being
hospitalized this week, in preparation for a stem cell transplant,
and will miss the Yankees' road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's pitching is built on habits. He likes his workout
routine to be consistent; he hates to have an extra day of rest
between starts; he likes to work with the same catcher; he keeps
the bill of his cap low, an attempt to block out anything that
exists besides the hitter and his catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre has been his pitching coach since the outset of the
1996 season, working closely with the left-hander. Joe Torre, the
Yankees' manager, mentioned Wednesday how it is he, Torre, that
gets all the credit for staving off the possible trade of Pettitte
in July of 1999. In fact, Torre said, he took his cue from
Stottlemyre and his reading of Pettitte's problems last summer, and
his faith that Pettitte would rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre possesses a special insight into Pettitte's psyche,
perhaps because of their similar demeanors _ ``Fire and
brimstone,'' Torre called them. There have been games when Pettitte
has stomped back to the dugout after a bad inning, hurled his glove
and cap against the bench and retreated to the clubhouse angrily.
Stottlemyre would turn and give Torre a broad and knowing smile
then follow Pettitte, to calm the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte proceeded without Stottlemyre Wednesday night.
Presumably, the pitching coach watched the game; presumably, he was
exceptionally pleased.

THE SKY RAINS HORROR ON A NEIGHBORHOOD
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ One instant it was a normal weekday
morning in the suburbs and the next it was a surreal nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Three bodies fell from one of the planes that had collided in
midair, and landed in an athletic field where the children of the
Steeplechase subdivision play soccer and football and families
gather annually for an end-of-the-summer block party.
</P>
<P>
   Another body crashed through the roof of a garage on Spur Court
a few hundred feet east of the field. An engine plummeted into
Jackie Framo's yard, about 40 feet from her front doorstep, while
she was dressing. At first, when she looked out of her window, she
thought an underground gas main had exploded because she saw smoke
pouring up from ``this mangled piece of metal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucci, a 34-year-old furniture wholesaler, heard a loud
noise, apparently the collision, as he sat at his home computer,
punching furniture sales orders to a factory in Iowa. He hurried
outside and said he saw a plane spinning in circles and burning as
it passed over a corner of his house about 30 feet above the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the heck out of me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bucci started running up Steeplechase Boulevard, the main street
through the development, but was stopped, he said, by an explosion,
a huge ball of fire and flames jumping from the curbside openings
of storm sewers.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had slammed into the side of a garage at 1 Philly
Court and burst into flames, incinerating two cars in the garage
and dooming the remaining five of the plane's original nine
passengers _ all civilian employees of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The fire destroyed the brick Georgian home at 1 Philly Court,
with two flower urns flanking the front door. It also scorched a
wall of an adjacent house. All the occupants and their pets fled
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Bucci said that when the plane exploded, he was rushing toward
the house in hopes of helping someone. But the flames blocked him.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine plane skimmed the rooftops in Steeplechase. The
other plane, a two-seater, with a pilot instructor and an aviation
student aboard, limped along the development's northern edge and
fell into a field of soybeans, killing both aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Miles, 30, wanted to help some of the victims but realized
minutes after seeing them that her intentions were futile.
</P>
<P>
   She was taking a shower when she heard a rumbling that she
mistook for thunder. Minutes later, she went downstairs, heard a
televised news report about the crash and then looked out her
kitchen window onto the development's athletic field and saw what
she thought was a body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran out to help,'' she recalled. ``But I got about
three-quarters of the way up to the body and realized there was
nothing I could do.'' Realizing the person was dead, she returned
to her kitchen and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Sausman, 12, said the first instinct of his mother, Kathy,
was to rush to the burning house. Sean said they watched from their
driveway as the plane spun toward 1 Philly Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the plane going down, trailing smoke,'' the boy said.
``My mom's a nurse and she wanted to go down to see what she could
do to help. But all of a sudden all these police cars and
ambulances went flying by our house.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all the residents escaped unhurt. After visiting the
crash site in late morning, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New
Jersey termed the absence of injuries on the ground a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Steeplechase has about 700 homes, all built in the last five
years on a 37-acre plot once filled by soybeans. It is about 10
miles northeast of Philadelphia and is one of hundreds of big
subdivisions that have filled the woods and fields throughout New
Jersey in the last 20 years. The development has a horse racing
motif. One section is called Belmont, another Churchill Downs and
another the Paddock.
</P>
<P>
   As dusk fell, children and parents pushing babies in strollers
went to the police lines near the complex's ball field to glimpse
the ruins of 1 Philly Court about 300 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The state police let three reporters view the crash site where
the five bodies were found. They reported to the rest of the media
that neighbors were sitting in their yards, sipping cool drinks,
and declining to talk about the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   Their yards were cluttered with debris from the plane, all
sitting in the middle of bright orange circles of spray paint that
investigators had applied.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is right to be concerned about the
military confrontation between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, a
conflict that U.S. intelligence agencies now judge to be one of the
world's most perilous. The dispute over who will control India's
only Muslim-majority state has already provoked two wars. That was
before New Delhi and Islamabad acquired nuclear bombs and
medium-range missiles. Now any resumption of full-scale conflict
carries the risk of starting a nuclear war between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   The world survived four decades of nuclear confrontation between
the United States and the Soviet Union because Washington and
Moscow established rules of behavior and crisis management. The two
superpowers waged proxy battles in the third world, but rarely
challenged each other's most vital interests or survival. By
contrast, India and Pakistan dispute a common land border not very
distant from either Islamabad or New Delhi. Many Pakistanis, raised
in a country founded on the principle of religious separatism,
believe the Muslims of Kashmir must be liberated from Indian rule.
India feels that retaining Kashmir is essential to its survival as
a diverse, multicultural nation.
</P>
<P>
   America cannot calm this dangerous conflict overnight. But it
must nudge both sides toward dialogue. President Clinton took some
useful steps on his South Asia trip earlier this year. He warned
Pakistan, which has often enjoyed U.S. support in the past, that it
should not assume Washington will come to its rescue if it provokes
a new conflict with India. In India, Clinton stressed U.S.
friendship and desire for better relations, but also urged New
Delhi to seek political dialogue with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India must also start talks with militant Muslim groups in
Kashmir. A promising initiative with one such group, Hizbul
Mujahedeen, broke down on Tuesday, leading the militants to end a
brief cease-fire. One problem was Hizbul Mujahedeen's insistence
that Pakistan be represented at the talks, something India refuses
to accept. Washington should press both sides to come back to the
table without preconditions. Every reasonable effort must be made
to avoid a new Kashmir war.  &QL;

   (Phoenix) - Tracy Matzen has nothing left but the clothes on his
back and a story to tell about confusion, government bureaucracy
and bad luck. But he doesn't want me to tell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things are important,'' he says. ``But if there's
one thing I've learned from all this it's that they're not the most
important things. I'd rather talk about the things we lost that
really matter, that have value.''
</P>
<P>
   Matzen says he didn't understand what those things were until he
lost everything, which happened 10 days ago in northwest Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Like many couples, Matzen and his wife thought it would be nice
to have a brand new home, a place in which they and their three
children would be the very first occupants. Matzen works for a
local communications company. He has a good job and has lived in
town for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was going along just fine,'' Matzen says. ``My wife
and I even joked about things going (beginitalic)too(enditalic)
good. Well, we were right.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the part Matzen doesn't want to dwell on. After their
old house sold, problems developed in the house they were building.
They involved water meters and misinformation and confusion.
Ultimately, it meant the Matzen family would have to find temporary
housing until their new place was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime around 2 a.m. July 31, Matzen and his family pulled
into the Hawthorn Suites near Thunderbird and Interstate 17. He was
driving his 1992 four-door white GMC Jimmy, behind which he towed a
U-Haul trailer. The plan was to put their possessions in storage,
but that would happen early the next day. Matzen went to bed about
3 a.m. By 6 the next morning, the truck and trailer were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first you're just stunned,'' Matzen says. He looked all
around the parking lot, as if he could have misplaced two large
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you realize what happened, and all that you lost.''
Clothes. Possessions (including Matzen's 25th anniversary Fender
Stratocaster guitar.) Everything. Neither the Jimmy nor the trailer
has turned up yet. Still, Matzen doesn't want charity. He figures
the insurance company will handle the losses, except for the
family's most precious items: their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the video recorder that was stolen is a tape,'' Matzen
says. ``It begins three months ago, just after our daughter (Casey)
was born. I'd give anything to have that tape back.'' Also gone is
a baby book Cori Matzen was keeping on Casey. And pictures of
8-year-old D.J. and 7-year-old Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely, I tell Matzen, that the thieves who case motels
looking for families to rob spend much time reading the papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he says. ``But you always have hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Matzen never imagined losing everything. And if he had, he
wouldn't have imagined his greatest loss would be pictures. Now, he
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Our recollections fade, whether we like it or not. Our pictures,
which once only reinforced the past, in time
(beginitalic)become(enditalic) our memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should realize how precious they are,'' Matzen says.
``They're the real riches in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper article won't get back what the Matzens lost.
They'll have to take new pictures and begin a new baby book. And
they'll need new things to paste into it.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, this.

CLINTON HONORS 15 WITH PRESIDENTIAL MEDALS OF FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS name of organization in 3rd graf from bottom)   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidents get to hand out plenty of perks _ from
ambassadorships and State Dinner invitations to, on the low end of
the scale, specially made boxes of M&AMP;Ms bearing the presidential
seal.
</P>
<P>
   With just five months left in his term, and his opportunities
for give-backs dwindling, President Clinton on Wednesday singled
out 15 people for Presidential Medals of Freedom, the country's
highest civilian honor. Some of the awards seemed to represent
belated presidential thank-yous. Some clearly had a political
twist. At least one was a consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the awards, Clinton said he had huddled with his
Senate candidate wife in recent weeks to review the possibilities,
upstanding people from all walks of life nominated by aides and
outsiders alike.
</P>
<P>
   The honorees crowded the stage in the East Room. John Kenneth
Galbraith, the Harvard economist, sat next to Monsignor George G.
Higgins, a labor activist, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is
Clinton's envoy to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many things that I and the president are going to
miss about living and being part of the White House's life but
nothing more than this ceremony,'' said Hillary Rodham Clinton
during the elaborate ceremony featuring a Marine band, smartly
dressed military aides and the attendance of much of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the selection process itself is cloaked in mystery,
Mrs. Clinton perhaps had a role in advocating the names of Marian
Wright Edelman, her first boss at the Children's Defense Fund; the
Rev. Gardner C. Taylor, a prominent preacher from Brooklyn who has
backed her campaign; and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the man she
hopes to succeed in the Senate representing New York.
</P>
<P>
   The award was a consolation prize for Wesley K. Clark, who was
supreme allied commander of NATO during the air campaign over
Kosovo but lost out in his goal of becoming chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Now an investment banker, he wore a dark suit
instead of a uniform but still stood ramrod straight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, over the course of his presidency, has doled out 83 of
the gold medallions decorated with red, white and blue _ half a
dozen during his first year, only a pair in 1997, 17 during the
mid-point of his second term. There are no limits to the number of
medals that can be issued, and although White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said this was the final medal ceremony of the year, he
added, ``The president always reserves the right to do something on
a more ad hoc basis near the end of the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always reached out to Republicans in handing out the
awards, a practice he continued this year. Former Sen. Bob Dole won
the honor the year after he lost to Clinton in the 1996
presidential race. Former President Gerald Ford joined former
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, in the East Room
Ceremony in 1999. This year, John Chafee, the late Rhode Island
senator, won the award posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   Other honorees this year included Holocaust survivor Simon
Wiesenthal, who listened to the ceremony by telephone while
recovering from a fall; Cruz Reynoso, a former judge from
California who is vice chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights; former Sen. George McGovern, who was the 1972 Democratic
presidential nominee; James Edward Burke, chairman of the
Partnership for a Drug-Free America; William Crowe, former chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Mildred Jeffrey, a labor activist;
and Mathilde Krim, founder of the Amer- ican Foundation for AIDS
Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highest honor of my life,'' said McGovern. ``I
treasure it even more than running for the presidency of the United
States. If I had won, that would have been the greatest honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, he would have been the one handing out medals.

BEST LEADERS RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   People join companies. They leave managers.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often a buzzword or phrase jumps to the top of the
business-speak charts. The above is the current buzz. Hot on its
heels is, ``It's the managers, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy's No. 1 employment problem _ attracting and
keeping good workers _ has put supervisors on notice: They're going
to be held accountable for employee retention in their departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are managers who are naturally great retention
managers,'' said Sharon Jordan-Evans, co-author of Love 'Em or Lose
'Em: Getting Good People to Stay. ``But they account for maybe only
10 percent. The majority of managers don't fall in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   What does a good retention manager do?
</P>
<P>
   According to Training magazine, the good ones meet with their
workers at least monthly _ not just in a once-a-year appraisal _ to
address problems, recognize strong performance and ask the workers
what they need to make their jobs more fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   And, once they find out what the good worker wants and needs,
the good retention manager finds job assignments and opportunities
that are likely to encourage them to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner Corp., for example, has become extremely serious about
holding managers accountable for keeping the stars and solid
performers on their staffs. Stan Sword, Cerner's chief people
officer, said turnover was costing the North Kansas City company
$35 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set a goal to improve retention, and we've placed greater
responsibility among our managers than they'd ever thought
possible,'' Sword said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees leave jobs for many reasons _ bigger challenges,
promotions, fewer work hours, better pay, less travel _ but ``most
of the time (employees) are leaving because of relationships. They
just won't say their manager was a jerk,'' Sword said.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner draws retention tips from Love 'Em or Lose 'Em. In
seminars and written handouts, the company teaches its managers
about their retention responsibilities. Departmental turnover
numbers are monitored monthly and, if the number is too high, the
manager is called in for a ``What's wrong?'' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Retention experts emphasize that some turnover is healthy.
Generally, nobody mourns the loss of dead wood, the bottom 10
percent to 20 percent of performers. But, for the top 20 percent to
25 percent of employees in particular, woe to the boss who loses
too many or fails to provide rewarding career paths for them.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner even has created a ``career navigation center'' where,
Sword said, employees can ``confidentially get a better position if
their current manager has been stifling them.''
</P>
<P>
   Employee retention is a one-on-one activity, Jordan-Evans
advises. One-on-one, every manager should ask his or her key
employees, ``What will it take to keep you here?''
</P>
<P>
   Managers in many organizations don't ask because they're afraid
of what they'll hear, or they're afraid they have no power (or
budget) to implement the request. Companies serious about retention
are helping their managers figure out how to do it.

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S POLICE COMMISSIONER 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Police Commissioner Howard Safir, New York
City's 39th police chief, provides the opportunity to praise him
for his dramatic success over the last four years in cutting crime
rates to their lowest levels since the 1960s. It also offers a
chance for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to choose the right successor to
conclude his own term as mayor. Giuliani should pick someone who
can not only keep crime rates low but also deal more expertly with
the frictions between police and minorities that Safir leaves
behind. It must be someone who can reassure all New Yorkers that
keeping down crime does not involve a tradeoff in civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of his tour of duty, it was clear that Safir
had agreed to leave the boasting rights about safer streets to
Giuliani. The previous commissioner, William Bratton, had reaped
much of the early credit for the drop in crime, never a wise move
for a Giuliani underling. Bratton instituted computer tracking of
crimes to deploy police where they were needed, and began a
``quality of life'' crackdown on lesser violations. Safir continued
or expanded these ventures, but he also launched efforts of his
own, including better training, special units to battle gangs and
drugs and expanded use of DNA analysis to track criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Safir's watch several high-profile incidents left
minority New Yorkers alarmed about how often they are viewed as
suspects and concerned that the price of lower crime rates was
police harassment of immigrants, blacks and Hispanics. The police
torture of the Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the more
recent shootings of two unarmed black men, Amadou Diallo and
Patrick Dorismond, raised questions about training, reporting of
violations and the expansion of independent street crime units
during Safir's term of office. The commissioner cited statistics
showing an overall decline in police shootings, civilian complaints
and brutality lawsuits during his term. But he seemed to miss the
point that the city's minority communities were in a state of
chronic fear about careless or hostile police tactics.
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of the mayor's loyal commissioner, Giuliani
needs to choose a replacement who can take command of the nation's
largest police department quickly. The new commissioner must
oversee difficult negotiations with police unions and deal with the
demands of federal and state investigators criticizing the
department after the Louima and Diallo cases. And he or she must
command respect not only from New York's 40,000-member police force
but also from a diverse citizenry that wants to feel safe both from
crime and from the fear of excessive police tactics.

BEST LEADERS RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   People join companies. They leave managers.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often a buzzword or phrase jumps to the top of the
business-speak charts. The above is the current buzz. Hot on its
heels is, ``It's the managers, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy's No. 1 employment problem _ attracting and
keeping good workers _ has put supervisors on notice: They're going
to be held accountable for employee retention in their departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are managers who are naturally great retention
managers,'' said Sharon Jordan-Evans, co-author of Love 'Em or Lose
'Em: Getting Good People to Stay. ``But they account for maybe only
10 percent. The majority of managers don't fall in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   What does a good retention manager do?
</P>
<P>
   According to Training magazine, the good ones meet with their
workers at least monthly _ not just in a once-a-year appraisal _ to
address problems, recognize strong performance and ask the workers
what they need to make their jobs more fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   And, once they find out what the good worker wants and needs,
the good retention manager finds job assignments and opportunities
that are likely to encourage them to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner Corp., for example, has become extremely serious about
holding managers accountable for keeping the stars and solid
performers on their staffs. Stan Sword, Cerner's chief people
officer, said turnover was costing the North Kansas City company
$35 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set a goal to improve retention, and we've placed greater
responsibility among our managers than they'd ever thought
possible,'' Sword said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees leave jobs for many reasons _ bigger challenges,
promotions, fewer work hours, better pay, less travel _ but ``most
of the time (employees) are leaving because of relationships. They
just won't say their manager was a jerk,'' Sword said.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner draws retention tips from Love 'Em or Lose 'Em. In
seminars and written handouts, the company teaches its managers
about their retention responsibilities. Departmental turnover
numbers are monitored monthly and, if the number is too high, the
manager is called in for a ``What's wrong?'' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Retention experts emphasize that some turnover is healthy.
Generally, nobody mourns the loss of dead wood, the bottom 10
percent to 20 percent of performers. But, for the top 20 percent to
25 percent of employees in particular, woe to the boss who loses
too many or fails to provide rewarding career paths for them.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner even has created a ``career navigation center'' where,
Sword said, employees can ``confidentially get a better position if
their current manager has been stifling them.''
</P>
<P>
   Employee retention is a one-on-one activity, Jordan-Evans
advises. One-on-one, every manager should ask his or her key
employees, ``What will it take to keep you here?''
</P>
<P>
   Managers in many organizations don't ask because they're afraid
of what they'll hear, or they're afraid they have no power (or
budget) to implement the request. Companies serious about retention
are helping their managers figure out how to do it.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show that Asian-Americans, especially new
immigrants, are largely uneducated about AIDS. More than any other
ethnic group, Asian-Americans do not get diagnosed with AIDS until
the disease is already in its later stages. This reflects a dearth
of Asian-language educational materials. Conservative cultural
beliefs also hamper open discussions about AIDS. Stepping up AIDS
education efforts would help increase understanding. But the most
influence lies with community leaders, who can encourage public
dialogue on AIDS and acceptance of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   So far, community groups have been leading AIDS education
efforts. These organizations have received state and federal
funding, but they need more assistance. Organizations have to
provide educational materials in languages ranging from Punjabi to
Mandarin. But more important, they must focus on cultural
differences. A Japanese group may react very differently to AIDS
education than a Korean one would.
</P>
<P>
   Even improvements in AIDS education will not be enough if the
community's silence on the disease persists. Unfortunately, many
influential religious leaders have refused to allow AIDS education
into their places of worship. It is encouraging that the
Chinese-American Planning Council has begun an AIDS education
program for prostitutes in New York City's Chinatown. Public health
agencies must also do more. But leaders and organizations, which
can reach their communities through a common language and culture,
will have the most effect.

THOMPSON-TORRES: THE RIVALRY THAT ISN'T (REALLY)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Dara Torres and Jenny Thompson exchanged
first-place finishes and American records Wednesday in the
100-meter butterfly, but not one meaningful glance.
</P>
<P>
   This news flash went along press row at the Indiana University
Natatorium during the opening day of the U.S. Olympic Trials with
all the seriousness of an Eric Sevareid report.
</P>
<P>
   Torres and Thompson, teammates at Stanford, have a relationship
as complicated as Bill and Hillary's. They haven't trained together
since December, a break that coincided with Torres' torrid rise
from retiree to record holder.
</P>
<P>
   Torres trimmed 0.3 seconds off Thompson's American record in the
morning heats with a 57.58 clocking, and Thompson prevailed in the
evening's semifinals with a 57.59, setting the stage for a final
today that promises to be everything Maurice and Michael's 200
meters at last month's U.S. Track and Field Trials was not.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Torres and Thompson's tit-for-tat times, the
interplay between the two sprinters took center stage.
</P>
<P>
   A few reporters, smelling bad blood in the water, have circled
the swimmers and sunk their teeth into the rival angle. Thompson
and Torres have tried to wiggle free, with little success. It has
bordered on the absurd, watching journalists who are so competitive
they won't share quotes turn around and ask why Thompson and Torres
aren't splitting a lane in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Thompson and Torres have egos, but those aren't what
have clashed. Thompson didn't banish Torres from the group. It was
more of a personality scrap.
</P>
<P>
   We gleaned from more than one member of the team that the
Stanford women, who are tighter than their bodysuits, collectively
voted Torres off their watery oasis because her high-maintenance
personality was upsetting their delicate ego-logical balance.
</P>
<P>
   They decided if Torres wanted the coaching staff to herself, the
least they could do was accommodate her. That's why Torres has been
training on her own for the past eight months under Richard Quick's
supervision. Torres, 33, worked as a model and a broadcaster during
her time away from the sport so she's obviously comfortable with
the personal attention.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   The sports world is a sanctum for the self-absorbed. And if you
think about it, only someone with a highly evolved hubris would
commit to a comeback after seven years off.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a healthy self-image to attempt the seemingly
unimaginable. Torres is what she is and that goes a long way toward
explaining why she's on the verge of becoming the first American
swimmer, male or female, to participate in four Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A first or second-place finish in the 100 butterfly final today
and Torres is on her way to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   A first or second-place finish would place Thompson on her third
Olympic team and afford her the opportunity to become the most
decorated U.S. female Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   She is U.S. Swimming's heirloom, having graced the national team
for the past 14 years _ more than half her life. The 27-year-old's
longevity in the sport rivals Darrell Green's in football or Carl
Lewis's in track and field. Her Olympic gold medal collection
(five, all in relays) has been equaled in this country only by
speedskater Bonnie Blair. And yet Thompson's public profile never
has quite caught up to her stature.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't make sense, but it's easily explained: Thompson
doesn't court the spotlight. If it comes, she'll happily take a
bow. But she doesn't need a milk mustache or a magazine cover or a
deferential press to complete her.
</P>
<P>
   One of her friends on the Stanford team said, ``I think Jenny
would like to have more of the attention. She's a wonderful person
and deserves it, absolutely. But she's not going to change who she
is to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's personality indulges thoughtfulness and loyalty and
fun but has no use for preening and posturing. She immersed herself
in swimming not so others would someday feel good about her but
because it made her feel good about herself.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens today and the rest of the meet, Thompson
already has her next challenge in sight; next August she will
enroll at the Columbia University Medical School to fulfill her
childhood dream of becoming a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what kind, she replied drolly, ``A good one, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wounds are hard to heal. Thompson's closest friends
occasionally wish she had grown a thicker coat of conceit so life's
arrows would bounce harmlessly off her.
</P>
<P>
   At a meet in Irvine in June, Thompson was walking with the
slumped posture of a question mark. Dutch sprinter Inge de Bruijn
was in the midst of a world-record spree _ she has broken eight
world records since May, including Thompson's 100 fly mark _ that
appeared to be shooting holes in Thompson's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the month, Thompson came down with an intestinal virus
and had to pull out of a meet in Santa Clara. In her absence,
Torres set an American record in the 50 free, one of their four
head-to-head races.
</P>
<P>
   Missing that meet, in her own backyard, ``was devastating to
me,'' Thompson said. ``I had questions, like `Where am I in my
season?' I don't think it was that big a deal in hindsight, but it
seemed like it at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew L.A. was just what Thompson needed? She came to the
Janet Evans Invitational at USC in mid-July swimming in self-doubts
and left as the all-time fastest U.S. performer in the women's 100
freestyle. Her American-record clocking of 54.27 was a 0.21-second
improvement over her 1992 Trials effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The L.A. meet was really great for me,'' Thompson said, ``just
(in terms of) how I was feeling about my swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all that should matter. How Thompson and Torres feel
about each other is really beside the point. &QL;

BATTLE OVER PORK PROMOTION MONEY INTENSIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heat of election season has been turned up, with Republicans
questioning the moral fiber of Democratic leaders and Democrats
calling the new Republican claims of inclusiveness a sham. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there is no more bitter campaign being waged than an obscure
contest playing out primarily in the Midwest. Already there have
been charges of election fraud, and investigations have been
launched. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mud being slung in this fight comes off the boots of the
country's pig farmers. Its outcome will determine the future of
about $50 million they ante each year into the industry's promotion
war chest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Call this pork, the other campaign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this month, hog farmers can request absentee ballots
for a September vote on whether the 14-year-old national pork
checkoff program should be eliminated. The program requires hog
producers to kick 45 cents of every $100 in value of the hogs they
sell into a fund that pays for research and promotions, such as the
``Pork, the Other White Meat'' campaign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a group of independent hog farmers says that mega-hog farms,
some owned by companies that also do meat packing, unfairly benefit
from the checkoff. Mega-farms are putting small producers out of
business, the independents say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I be paying to cut my own throat?'' said Gary
Comstock, whose family raises about 6,000 pigs a year on a farm in
Vernon County, Mo., about 100 miles south of Kansas City. ``I think
the corporate farms are getting all the licks _ everything is going
their way. I don't think there is anybody in our corner.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fighting to keep the program is the National Pork Producers
Council and its state organizations, to which most of the millions
are funneled. Those groups believe the hog farmers who forced the
referendum are sorely mistaken if they believe they will fare
better against industrial agriculture without the checkoff
program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The large producers don't need the checkoff. They can spend
the money they would save on their own products better,'' said Karl
Johnson, who with his brother raises about 25,000 hogs a year on a
farm near Mankato, Minn. He is co-chairman of the national
council's Vote Yes Task Force. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said programs funded by checkoff dollars have given him
help with hog genetics and environmental issues that he couldn't
afford to pay for. That assistance has kept Johnson and his brother
in business, Johnson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The referendum effort was started by grass-roots farm
organizations such as the Campaign for Family Farms in Columbia,
Mo., about two years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a glut of hogs and a shortage of meat packing plants
resulted in hog prices dropping as low as 8 cents a pound, the
lowest at least since the 1930s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many hog farmers blamed the glut on corporate hog farms, some of
which raise or contract for millions of hogs a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The financial slaughter of 1998 was a watershed moment, said
Rhonda Perry, a hog farmer from Howard County near Columbia, who is
helping organize the referendum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Particularly galling has been the defense of corporate farms and
meat packers by the producers council at a time when smaller
farmers have challenged how much of the market they control, Perry
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Pork Producers Association, for example, opposed a
state law pushed by small operators that required meat packers to
daily post prices they were paying for hogs. The association later
backed a less stringent federal law that superseded the state
legislation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollars have been used to create political cover for some
of the corporations we think are not playing fair,'' Perry said.
``The NPPC goes before Congress on these issues as if it represents
all hog farmers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the big hog operations have been relatively quiet in
this fight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farmland Industries Inc. of Kansas City, one of the country's
largest pork processors, also contracts with members to raise some
hogs. It has not taken a public stand, but is urging eligible
members to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Perry scoffs at the idea that anyone besides some public
relations firms and the national producers council has benefited
much from the millions raised in checkoff dollars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Between the 1987 and 1997 farm census, the number of farms
raising hogs dropped from 243,398 to 109,754, a 55 percent
decrease, while the number of large farms has grown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Annual per capita consumption of pork has grown slightly, from
49 pounds in 1986 to 52.6 pounds by 1998, according to statistics
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The election has been hard-fought on both sides. Some members of
the national producers council contend the petition drive by the
Campaign for Family Farms didn't meet the letter of the law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late July, the Campaign for Family Farms accused the Missouri
Pork Producers Association and other state associations of trying
to rig the vote when its telemarketers called and the organizations
offered to get absentee ballots for farmers who supported their
position. The anti-checkoff group said election rules require each
eligible voter to request a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri association initially denied the allegations, then
sent out a press release saying election rules didn't prevent the
group from helping farmers get ballots. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The implication that the ballot request would violate the intent
of the rules but the agency failed to write them to specifically
prohibit that from happening, Kathleen Merrigan, administrator of
the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, said in a statement. The
marketing service is overseeing the election. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the statement said, the practice will not be
prohibited. All the ballots must be signed and the nameswill be
public, the statement said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the farmer from Minnesota, is sorry to see hog
producers fighting so bitterly among themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has changed agriculture, like it has changed every
business. While we don't have to like what is going on today, it is
happening,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said she knows it won't ever be like it was 30 years ago.
But she and other small operators aren't going to pretend that what
is good for corporate farms is good for them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The tent is not big enough for packers, corporate hog farms
and independent farmers,'' Perry said. &QL;

FORD RECALLS SOME SMALL SUVS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. has recalled more than 1,900 of the new small
sport-utility vehicles built at its Claycomo plant, citing a defect
in the steering column.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,300 Ford Escapes and 625 Mazda Tributes were identified
as having a defective nut that could cause the steering wheel to
separate from the steering column, said Rich Voytowich, a Ford
spokesman at its Dearborn, Mich., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was first reported in the Aug. 7 issue of Automotive
News.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles were repaired with replacement parts at the
dealerships, Ford officials said. Ford started shipping the new
product to dealers in late July, and only about a dozen customers
around the country owned the small SUVs with the defect, according
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ford began assembling the SUVs with the replacement nuts at the
Claycomo plant last week.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing of Escapes and Tributes began in June, and the
Claycomo factory still is trying to increase the line speed on the
new vehicle's production. According to statistics tracked by
Automotive News, 1,259 SUVs were built at Claycomo last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's production goal is to build about 220,000 Escapes and
30,000 Tributes at Claycomo for the 2001 model year.

   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani acknowledged for the first
time on Wednesday night, in a television interview, that he knew
about the criminal activity that his father engaged in before he
was born, which was revealed in a book published last month. The
mayor said his father's mistakes influenced him to go into law
enforcment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it I knew, some of it I suspected,'' Giuliani said of
the accounts in the book, ``Rudy! An Investigative Biography of
Rudolph Giuliani,'' by Wayne Barrett, a reporter for The Village
Voice.
</P>
<P>
   The book describes Harold Giuliani's prison stint for armed
robbery of a milkman and contends that the elder Giuliani was an
enforcer for his brother-in-law's loan sharking operation. ``Some
of it,'' the mayor said, ``did come as a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney, had refused
to answer recent questions about his father, other than to defend
him as scrupulously honest and the ``finest man'' he had ever
known.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday night, in an interview on ``New York Close-up''
on NY1 with Sam Roberts, the program's host and deputy editor of
the Week in Review section of The New York Times, the mayor opened
up a little.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani refused, however, to say just what he knew and when he
knew it. ``Some of it I knew, some of it I suspected, some of it I
absolutely didn't know, and when I write my book, I'll explain
which is which,'' he said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barrett's book, in 1934, Harold Giuliani, with an
accomplice, pulled a gun on a milkman in a building on East 96th
Street in Manhattan, robbed him of $128.82 and served a year and a
half at Sing Sing, under a fake name that he gave to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani, who said he has not read the book, said that his
father was ``compulsive about being honest,'' perhaps to compensate
for his past deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would tell me, `Never take anybody else's money, make sure
you always pay for things, make sure that you don't make a mistake
when you fill out a form, make sure it's accurate,''' the mayor
said. ``I've driven myself crazy over this all my life. And when
any mistake has been made it really bothers me, and I realize more
than I did as I was growing up why my father was doing that. I
mean, he wanted to make sure that I didn't make the same mistakes
that he believed he had made.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his father's criminal past had influenced him to
go into law enforcement, Giuliani replied, `I'm sure it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's book also said that several of the mayor's cousins
were involved in organized crime, and the mayor said that his
parents' decision to move to Long Island was in part an attempt to
get him away from an unsavory element.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the decision that my father and mother made,
essentially was to take me out of Brooklyn, where they thought I
could get into trouble,'' he said, ``and keep me away from some of
the things that I guess my father was worried about.''
